    Ace Attorney, alongside Pokemon and JJBA, is one of my absolute favourite media franchises. I have spent countless hours playing the games over and over, producing fanworks, and discussing them at essay-length. So, as much as I appreciate the need to be objective and focused in my review, I feel that it needs to be said:<br />
<br />
I hate this anime. I hate it so fucking much.<br />
<br />
Sono &quot;Shinjitsu&quot; Igi Ari is an adaptation of the first two games in the series, and right off the bat we&#039;ve hit a huge stumbling block. Each of these two games would be more fit to a full 24 episode anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301031">
        in their own right than being crammed into one cour each. Unsurprisingly, a lot of content was trimmed in the process of fitting both games, and what content survived the cull is rushed through at breakneck pace.<br />
<br />
The dialogue is cut down the most, and being that the source material uses mostly text-based storytelling this is a huge blow. Losing so much dialogue not only robs the series of much of its charm, but also does serious damage to its characterisation. Phoenix in particular is characterised mostly through his constant snarky, quipping inner monologue, which is almost entirely absent here.<br />
<br />
We barely get to know most of the characters, making it difficult to be invested in their character arcs - and that&#039;s just the ones whose arcs were actually shown in the anime instead of being skimmed over. Many characters are stripped down to the barest of plot relevance, and others are reduced to nothing more than a cameo appearance.<br />
<br />
The bread and butter of Ace Attorney is its contradictions, the solving of which drives the murder mystery plots the series revolves around. Even these are changed, however, in the name of this streamlined approach. Twists are replaced with simplified, obvious alternatives that not only remove the satisfaction of seeing the more obtuse mysteries cracked, but also make you question the logic of everyone responsible for presenting these flawed arguments in the first place, making it much harder to take the prosecutors seriously as competent opponents.<br />
<br />
The trimmed-down dialogue also cuts key context on evidence used throughout the series. One of the most important principles of good detective fiction is that all clues used to solve the mystery should be clearly shown - that the audience should have all the necessary tools to solve the mystery themselves. While the games did this by sheer necessity of the medium, the anime makes no such effort, making the resolutions often feel cheap and unearned.<br />
<br />
This pacing severely damages the presentation of the anime, sacrificing any attempt to preserve the dramatic tension of the games - most contradictions are resolved almost as soon as they come up. And even outside of issues caused by the pacing, the presentation suffers. The quality of the art and animation here is appalling. The errors are constant and glaring. The animation is often comically sloppy. The character designs also stray from the original designs to their detriment, going with an oddly wide-faced look that gives the characters strange facial proportions. Also, they can never quite seem to get Phoenix&#039;s hair-spikes right, with them changing shape every time we see them. There is also an excessive overuse of CG animation to cut corners, most obviously in the CG court gallery that has, for whatever reason, been made so much more visible than it was in the source material, as if deliberately trying to highlight how poor the animation is.<br />
<br />
The effects used for dramatic emphasis are cheesy, and adapt the tone of the games poorly - the more abstract effects of the source are replaced with literal auras and dramatic gusts of wind.<br />
<br />
The voice cast is similarly poor, featuring many miscast or noticably inexperienced actors. The entire cast seems to either underact or overact with little middle ground. The only notable exception is Yuuki Aoi as Maya Fey, who seems intent on stealing every scene she is in.<br />
<br />
The anime handles Maya well in general, especially in comparison to its treatment of many other characters. Not only is her character arc left more or less intact, but the animators emphasise her goofy and hyperactive nature far better than a set of 14 sprites ever could.<br />
<br />
On the subject of things the anime did well, most of the anime-original content is quite good. Ignoring whatever logic lead A-1 to add anime-original content whilst also cutting game-canon content, the additional focus on Phoenix, Edgeworth, and Larry&#039;s shared backstory, and adding the Signal Samurai motif that represents their friendship (as well as giving some background to Edgeworth&#039;s secret love of Super Sentai series) enriches the dynamic these characters have.<br />
<br />
The cuts made do sometimes work to the series&#039; benefit, too. Turnabout Big Top, which is considered by many to be the worst case in the franchise (which it isn&#039;t, by the way - fight me nerds) benefits from reduced screentime on some of its more irritating supporting characters, such as Trilo Quist, or that fucking clown. There does seem to be a rule of inverse quality in this adaptation, though - the worst cases are the ones handled the best, whereas the cases that were the series highlight in the source suffer the most from these alterations.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s hard to say what the point of this anime is. It was made by A-1&#039;s b-team (now CloverWorks, a seperate studio) with little care or attention put into it. At worst, this was a shoddy adaptation by a studio looking to make a quick buck. At best, this was a misguided attempt to adapt a great series by people who have a fundamental lack of understanding of what made these games so good in the first place.<br />
<br />
One way or another, this is an awful adaptation that should only be watched by people who are already fans of the series, and are more interested in seeing another interpretation of the story than in seeing a competent adaptation - and even then, they should go in with low expectations.<br />
<br />
Please don&#039;t let this be your introduction to the franchise.<br />

    Let&#039;s tackle this tightrope walk, called &quot;Gyakuten Saiban: Sono &quot;Shinjitsu&quot;, Igi Ari!&quot;<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want to make any excuses for a bad adaptation because, for me, it didn&#039;t feel like one. Was it on the top of anime adaptations from other source material that I&#039;ve seen so far? - No<br />
Was it horrible enough to bring me to the edge of dropping the series? - Hell no<br />
<br />
You see, the games themselves are complex in a way you wouldn&#039;t expect them to be when you look at a summary of what you basically do. To transfer this from a platform that allows you to do investigation yourself, finding

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230032">
        clues, and uncovering the truth, onto the screen were you&#039;re a passive watcher... that&#039;s no easy task.<br />
<br />
To fairly judge the Ace Attorney anime you need to understand that it&#039;s not about copy and pasting the events on TV but that the producers had to neccessarily scrap some of the points they deemed too much for casual watchers who didn&#039;t play the game; but at the same time keeping the ones who knew the franchise beforehand at bay.<br />
<br />
The pacing for the first two cases started off quite nice, I really enjoyed the introduction though they should have made it more clear that &quot;casual watchers&quot; couldn&#039;t expect a serious anime about the law. Because the games just aren&#039;t, let&#039;s be honest. <br />
(They&#039;d probably arrest you if you&#039;d bring a whip to the prosecution stand.)<br />
<br />
Midway through, from episode 4-10, the pacing got rushed and therefore the anime failed to really convince both sides, unfortunately. I know, it&#039;s hard when you&#039;ve been given a limited number of episodes to fit into a season but if that&#039;s the case, maybe they should have just covered one of the games and not two of them.<br />
Episode 13 was a very sweet addition though and I applaud them for giving us kid Naruhodo, Yahari und Mitsurugi. <br />
<br />
The art and animation was overall fine, sometimes... &quot;interesting&quot; (if you want to call it that). Still, those blemishes every now and then didn&#039;t take the enjoyment away. <br />
For me they were charmingly silly and made me laugh, rather than hating the series for not having a good style.<br />
<br />
But that voice acting. Especially the last episode brought back the intense feeling I had when reaching the critical point of this particular case just because the seiyuu put their heart into it and really delivered some awesome performances.<br />
The choices, in general, felt right; Kaji Yūki knows how to pull off great stuff and he made me love dorky Naruhodo even more. You can&#039;t like a series if you don&#039;t feel the main character, and he gave Naruhodo that rookie attorney gone wild vibe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, this isn&#039;t a masterpiece but it&#039;s surely not an anime made for the trash bin. If you want to have the full crazy experience, you better play the games because they offer detaisl you&#039;ll never find in a season anime that is made with 24 episodes in mind.<br />
Nonetheless, I enjoyed my time with this series even though some of my favourite features were missing. <br />
<br />

    The courtroom is a wonderful place full of controversy and despair.  Both the prosecution and defense have their own reasonings for choosing their sides, and the verdict in the end is never the most desired outcome.  But we&#039;re not here to talk about everyone&#039;s right to a fair trial, we&#039;re here to talk about everyone&#039;s right to a fun trial with A-1&#039;s adaptation of the first two games of Ace Attorney.  Put on your attorney&#039;s badge and get on your tiny bike.  It&#039;s time for objections and nonsensical court cases!<br />
<br />
Story: Naruhodo Ryuuichi is a new defense attorney who just got his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230113">
        license.  Upon entering the courtroom to deal with his first case, he finds himself defending his friend, Yahari in a court case against him on the accusation of MURDER!!!  Against prosecutor Mitsurugi Eiji, the two fight for Yahari&#039;s verdict and in spark a court rivalry over the two over the rest of the series.<br />
<br />
Taking the two first two games of the Phoenix Wright series, this adaptation...basically does what you would think it does, which is fully adapt all of the cases from the first two games of the series.  (Big shocker, I know.)  Because of this...there&#039;s not really much to say for the actual story of the series.  The main plotline is basically: Get involved with a case usually involving murder, have Naruhodo defend the accused while Mitsurugi does his best to prove someone guilty and ultimately figure out through a long hair-brained stream of hairbrained and highly improbable events, what happened with each case and who truly is the person who is guilty.  <br />
<br />
Admittedly, the story for this series isn&#039;t really all that good.  The show&#039;s pretty stagnant as to what&#039;ll happen and since it&#039;s basically an animated walkthrough of the games, you can guess what the end result for all of these cases are.  Doesn&#039;t mean that they&#039;re not fun to watch, but don&#039;t expect things are pretty predictable.  Apart from that, there&#039;s really not much to actually talk about.  The problem is because the series is so focused on the gameplay aspect of the series that there&#039;s not really much left for anything else aside from the cases, even if they&#039;re all really fun to watch.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Stays true to the Capcom game series<br />
-  Doesn&#039;t really show anything besides the court cases<br />
<br />
Characters: The characters for this series features a large and colorful cast of nutjobs and basket cases that come in only during the case in which they&#039;re important or needed in, as well as the more ordinary but still somewhat crazy main recurring characters that you&#039;ll probably never actually bore seeing.  Probably.  <br />
<br />
First we have Naruhodo Ryuuichi, or in the localization, Phoenix Wright.  Believing to stand up for the innocence as a defense attorney, Naruhodo doesn&#039;t really have much of a character beyond feeling a bit sick and tired of all of the crazy people he has to deal with from his hard to deal with clients and witnesses who bring their own brand of insanity into this joke of a courtroom, which is to be expected of a player character since it&#039;s easier to project onto them when they don&#039;t really have many character traits to them.<br />
<br />
Then you have Mitsurugi Eiji, the prosecutor and rival of our main protagonist.  Devoted to proving the accused as guilty, Mitsurugi plays as the &#039;villain&#039; of the series and continuously spends his screentime to win against Naruhodo.  His motives are pretty basic and the development that he gets later in the series is pretty paper thin, so similar to Naruhodo, there&#039;s not really much to say.  The dynamic between the characters is pretty cool, but on their own, they don&#039;t work out all too well.<br />
<br />
Aside from them, we have recurring characters like Mayoi (or Maya), Itonokogiri (or Gumshoe), and the nameless judge who apparently doesn&#039;t know a single thing that goes on in his courtroom despite being the person who puts down the final ruling.  All of whom are on the same level as the rivaling characters in terms of development and actual character traits and really don&#039;t differ much from when they&#039;re introduced to when the series ends.  Side characters on the other hand, aka the characters that pertain to one or two cases out of the entire series are amongst the reasons why this series is so entertaining.  Every side character is so wacky, out there, and downright strange that it&#039;s extremely awkward to watch them, yet you can&#039;t look away.  Sure they&#039;re one time characters, but making a really good and memorable impression of them far exceeds any other kind of impact that they would&#039;ve had otherwise.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Strange yet memorable side characters<br />
-  Main and recurring characters are pretty paper thin<br />
<br />
Art: Produced by A-1 pictures, the style and quality of the series is...standard fare at best.  It doesn&#039;t really good nor does it look average or mediocre, so the only explanation for the way this series looks is...average.  They do keep the funny looping idle animation and the character freakouts when you finally find the real culprit, so...good on you, A-1.  <br />
<br />
One problem that did arise upon watching this show was that the background characters, especially those who&#039;re in the seats in the courtroom were completely made in unnatural and lazy CGI, completely clashing with the rest of the series and the overall look when the entire court was panned out and shown.  They don&#039;t do this too often, but shame on you, A-1 for that.  Shame on you!<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Standard art for this day and age<br />
-  Blatant and lazy usage of CGI<br />
<br />
Sound:  The sound both in the voice acting and the soundtrack of the series are average at best.  There&#039;s not really much of anything to note when it comes to either of those, so...moving on.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:  Ace Attorney...really isn&#039;t all that good.  It&#039;s not bad, it&#039;s not amazing, it just has something about it that doesn&#039;t really do well quality-wise.  That being said, this show is a TON of fun to watch.  Without thinking too hard and just following along with the completely out there cases, this adaptation is by far one of the most enjoyable watches that I&#039;ve had in a while.  Sure it&#039;s not the best thing, but quality and enjoyment are two completely separate ratings here.  And if you have any objections, I&#039;ll be sure to give you a good cross-examination.<br />
<br />
Did I like this series?<br />
<br />
Oh, far too much.<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this series?<br />
<br />
Some characters were a bit irritating, but aside from that, there&#039;s not really much to complain here.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this series?<br />
<br />
Want a bit of fun?  Want a couple of funny memes?  Want to get through the first 2 Ace Attorney games without a real walkthrough on Youtube?  Than this is the show for you.

    To quote Franziska Von Karma, this anime is &quot;A foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool&quot;. Being a large fan of the games, I was highly enthused to hear of an anime adaptation coming, however upon its release I was only met with a painful and bland imitation of the original games, and even separately so, this anime is still rather one-note and drab. <br />
<br />
To the Anime&#039;s credit, I was rather pleased to see a good chunk of the anime&#039;s script was directly adapted from the games, this atleast lead to a coherent and unique narrative; and the sound

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274051">
        design was even better, being quite possibly being the best thing in the series, and feels like a very pleasing overhaul of the original game soundtrack. <br />
<br />
However this is where my compliments to the series end. Moving onto the art design, everything seems somewhat... wrong... A friend of mine says that A-1 has &quot;SAO-ified&quot; all of the character designs, which I&#039;m unsure of how true that is, but everything looks stilted and off regardless. It would probably also be prudent to mention Phoenix&#039;s stilted running animation in the intro for a majority of the episodes before it was fixed in the latter half. <br />
<br />
On top of this, the delivery and general scene direction is probably the worst thing this anime has to offer, and moved this anime from &quot;Boring&quot; to &quot;Awful&quot; in my eyes, as everything is done without heart or feeling. This is a hard point to describe without spoilers but I&#039;&#039;ll try my upmost; in the original games where there were scenes of high-tension and desperate action, with races against time and scurrying to find the right answer, there were instead.. not... Characters that were supposed to look and sound devastated at something, instead sounded just slightly annoyed, moreso like the local takeout got their order wrong, and not the levels of upset that were supposed to be shown. One scene in particular where a character was supposed to rush in just in time, with the loud and epic soundtrack making the viewer pumped, was instead replaced by a fairly quiet scene, and the character just walking in, without so-much a hint of tension. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, I dislike how character relationships are handled. Characters whose relationships were supposed to feel slightly off and people were maybe untrustworthy, were over-clarified so there was no longer the tension of &quot;Should we trust them?&quot; or &quot;Is this person trying to deceive us?&quot;<br />
<br />
This anime disappointed me. In my original list of things that upset me, I was also displeased that they had only adapted 2 of the original trilogy of games, however with the announcement of the second season of the anime just a few days before the writing of this review, I am hopeful that A-1 will infact have fixed the blatant errors in the anime and not ruin mine, and many others, favourite game in the franchise.

    This is my first review and I&#039;m gonna try to make it the best I can. Of course, this is spoiler free.<br />
<br />
Story 3/10:<br />
<br />
Since I&#039;ve ever heard about this anime I thought I&#039;d be awesome, I don&#039;t consider myself as a diehard fan of Ace Attorney, but man, I was very dissapointed when this anime got to the case 3. It was very awful, especially when it reached case 4. I&#039;ve watched 12 episodes of this anime. Enough episodes to say that the story is a total mess, it doesn&#039;t make sense sometimes and they skip very important parts of the story. Sometimes you couldn&#039;t realize

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222697">
        (If you haven&#039;t played the games) why something was the way it was, like, when they don&#039;t even explain anything about the facts, the things that happened but Phoenix does realizes it and suddenly he objects and like I said before, if you wouldn&#039;t have played the game then you wouldn&#039;t even realize why something it&#039;s the way it is. The story goes super fast and that makes it difficult to understand, the explanation of the facts and things that occur during a trial is very poor and you can&#039;t realize what&#039;s happening. <br />
<br />
Art 7/10:<br />
<br />
It&#039;s good, though it has its flaws. There were episodes wherein it wasn&#039;t that obvious that the face of some character was pretty lame, and not well illustrated. However, I think that (and this isn&#039;t spoiler) in the episode 11, the art was pretty bad and it was the most obvious episode to have dreadful faces and a bad illustration.<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10:<br />
<br />
It lacks of epicness. In the game, almost every track was epic and made you feel like you really were an attorney investigating, or having a trial and suddenly having to use logic to think of a solution to a dilemma, or being in a trial and cornering a witness or cross-examinating a testimony. The anime version of Cornered was the track I liked the most out of all the other ones. <br />
<br />
Character 3/10:<br />
<br />
Not enough development. I know it is an adaptation of the game but come on the creators could&#039;ve done this one right.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 4/10:<br />
<br />
It&#039;ll sound weird but, I enjoyed one or two episodes of this anime but only due to the fanservice and the references to the game, it was well made. If you are a fan of the franchise, then you could watch until the end of case 3. I don&#039;t recommend watching beyond that, because seriously, one of the best cases in the game got ruined because of this bad adaptation.<br />
<br />
Overall 5/10: <br />
<br />
I gave it a 2 before this review. But now I&#039;ll be more just and I will give it a 5 because although it disappointed me a lot, it did good some things and that deserves at least a 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
This was my first review. Sorry if I had grammar mistakes in the review, this isn&#039;t my native language. Also, if you find this helpful, mark it helpful as well.<br />

    Game design and animated series are two very completely different things. It may seem like a really absurd statement, but since Ace Attorney is an adaptation of a game, you need a good understanding of its game design, as to understand what would work on screen, since video games are executed in ways fitting to their gameplay. Sometimes, to make a game more engaging, you have to remove some realistic elements. Knowing this, I have decided to play the game myself, to understand why Ace Attorney is presented the way it is, some time during the time I was watching the anime. So I&#039;d like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239242">
        to explain how the hook, the trials, work in the game, and why on screen the trials are really ridiculous.<br />
<br />
You see, in the game, you are handling the trials. What you say, what arguments you refute and how you refute them. The more you refute the arguments of the opposing party, the more flustered they become and eventually, they burst out and that is used as a sign that you are winning. Their reactions are over the top but that is done with the purpose of showing you that you are clearly on the right track. In the games, you are also tasked with gathering evidence, in order for you learn more about the case and piece everything together as to have an idea of what to do in court and have an idea of what the case will be, but also to have more involvement in the investigation process, rather than await evidence and use what the cops find to your advantage, like a normal lawyer would. You will also discuss with the witnesses about the case and learn more about the story that way. The game will make you handle cases that you personally figure out with the evidence you have gathered, by paying attention to the information that mismatches your evidence. In this game, you figure it out. As a result of such the game needs a balancing scale, where it teaches you the basics.<br />
<br />
You see, both Ace Attorney&#039;s start with a fairly ridiculous trial, where you know for certain who the culprit is, because the game states it from the very start. Your defendant is also a childhood friend which is explained as getting fairly often into trouble that usualy isn&#039;t caused by him. Now as an introduction to the game, it isn&#039;t a particularly stellar introduction, considering you&#039;re gonna defend someone to whom you have social ties with,  (that has a high frequency by the way for I assume dramatic effect) but it&#039;s a better than an UI prompt that says &quot;This is your goal in the game. Go from x to y. That is the defendant. Your friend. That is the actual culprit. The culprit.&quot; The game actually gives you context and lets you learn by going along the way, in a manner that I&#039;d say is competent.<br />
<br />
In a series, however, you don&#039;t want to start off easy, but rather to impress the viewer since first glance. So since the same trial is presented here in the same manner, you will leave with a pisspoor first impression. You already know the culprit, the defendant has constant outbursts since his dialogue outside the court was mixed in, and the first episode is a gibberish mess. You have a culprit you already know, a defendant that makes no sense as to why he&#039;s acting in a manner that is incriminating, or as to why he wasn&#039;t instructed at least slightly to not have any sort of outbursts such as: flailing your arms wildly, screaming and hitting your head against a solid surface repeatedly. As I watched this, I immediately thought this is very stupid and since I&#039;ve seen the game, I am sure that whoever adapted this series doesn&#039;t understand the purpose of that trial. In the game, the trial is the starting point that familiarizes you with the game and its mechanics. You won&#039;t have too many complaints about how the trial emerges because YOU&#039;RE AN ACTIVE PART OF IT, and these things help you. In the game you have the choice to tell the defendant during the trial to asbtain from saying things and making them say the truth, and so on and so forth. You have control over him. His stupidity isn&#039;t an important factor. And the fact you already know the truth helps you plan out the case. But here, it makes everything seem really dull and ridiculous<br />
<br />
But perhaps this means that they&#039;re just trying to stay faithful to the adaptation and they&#039;re not exactly incompetent in this adaptation. In that case, let me move over to the next trial. In this trial there is an autopsy report. The situation is as follows. You present a discrepancy in a testimony  that says that a victim that has died immediately after a sudden blow to the head, had enough time to write the name of their killer after the attack, at a time they were most certainly dead. However, turns out that another autopsy report was released the next day, that says that the victim didn&#039;t die immediately after the blow. This is the line delivery in the game &quot;A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request, that says: Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object. The victim might&#039;ve lived for several minutes afterwards.&quot; Eloquent, to the point and most important, not ridiculous. This is the line delivery in the anime. &quot;Yesterday, another autopsy was performed, that changed the report from died instantly... to died PRETTY MUCH instantly.&quot;  That&#039;s the wording. Pretty much instantly. So I reacted by walking around in the room a bunch with my hand behind my head, thinking &quot;This is so bad. It&#039;s terrible. I love this. This is incredible.&quot; <br />
<br />
I expected at least some minimal level of professionalism and well defined thinking and reasoning, even if with any sort of logic gaps, but that, caught me completely offguard. I never expected quite what I got in Ace Attorney. I mean, you have cases where attorneys don&#039;t even talk to their defendants, like the first one. You have cases where the judge is bossed around by a guy and told to finish the trial, in front of everyone else, by the prosecutor. You have cases where the defendant, judge, defense attorney, and the witnesses, get repeatedly whipped. There&#039;s no professionalism in the trials.<br />
<br />
Okay then, perhaps it is because the series is quite lighthearted. Maybe it is not because the crimes themselves and the mystery aren&#039;t orchestrated well. Well, how does this sound? How about we frame the defense attorney that was defending the victim, as the murderer? Because that&#039;s the most logical way to go about things. Oh, okay, that sounds believable, right? How about keeping a bullet inside your shoulder after being shot for 15 years inside your body, a bullet that links you to an infamous incident, while also, somehow, avoiding lead poisoning and being able to function as healthy as a spring for said 15 years? Doesn&#039;t sound that good, does it? I think should be convincing enough, but lets ruin all credibility. How about shapeshifting your body in a trial, from a 8 year old little girl to a 27 year old woman with huge tits sticking out of her dress? Why do they shapeshift you ask? Oh, because of spirit summoning. They summon a spirit inside their body. Yes, this is an anime about handling trials in the courtroom. Yes, this is a recurring thing. Yes, it also is a recurring gag that nobody really questions this.<br />
<br />
These things are factors from the games too, but I have not crossreferenced everything I said to see if everything is the same in the game and the anime. And yes, these criticisms are fair for the game as well, if they are indeed there. But one thing that is clearly there is the spirit summoning, and in both cases, they take away from the trial, as Phoenix Wright couldn&#039;t have had solved the case, without outside intervention from an element that realistically wouldn&#039;t be able to be a factor. In the game itself, the literal second case, you can&#039;t solve this, without the intervention of the spirit. In other words, you, the player, can&#039;t solve your first case after the tutorial, on your own. But that is a flaw of the game, that I&#039;ve decided to state to say that the source material is far from perfect itself.<br />
<br />
Well, the next thing that you might think that, this was intended strictly for the fans of the game. Even then, I&#039;d say this is a pisspoor attempt that deserved no recognition, if you are to compare the animation quality, not to other anime, but rather to the game itself. The spritework animation in the game of Ace Attorney is absolutely gorgeous. It is incredible to see how much detail they have managed to add in spriteart, which is done by drawing everything pixel by pixel. Am I supposed to believe this is meant to be an omage to the fans of the game, when they couldn&#039;t even do proper shading on the characters in the anime&#039;s animation? Am I supposed to believe that when there&#039;s just the bare minimum of details in the animation, while the simple spritework of the game did so much work to convey as much detail as possible, am I supposed to think this is meant to be made for the fans? No, this is just someone exploiting the intelectual property for money. If this was meant for the fans, they would&#039;ve gotten far better animation, as I can&#039;t see how this anime could enrich the experience of the games, when they just have rushed in trials with pisspoor animations<br />
<br />
What is left to say about Ace Attorney? It is a mess. It is terrible. But it was really fun to watch. It is flawed in so many ways and on so many levels, that I&#039;ve enjoyed it a lot. Seeing the constant flow of flaws that it threw my way truly entertained me, because I really enjoy when a series is so flawed, that I have to praise them for it. This series did nothing right, except for a single episode, where they&#039;ve shown the childhood of Edgeworth, Phoenix Wright and Larry Butz, strictly because it is unexpected and has nothing to do with the cases. I found it endearing because there wasn&#039;t really any of the elements that made me rant what I&#039;ve ranted in the review. But the trials, have so many obstacles to be properly consumed, so many discrepancies, be it logic gaps, be it unprofessional behavior that leads nowhere, be it blownout overreactions, be it supernatural elements that shouldn&#039;t be a factor in court, be it etc, that I couldn&#039;t just manage not to enjoy the obstacles themselves. The reason I have not stated as many of the flaws I&#039;ve seen in this series because the flaws of the series were quite honestly the sole enjoyment factor I&#039;ve got out of it. I think anyone that watches stuff and can enjoy a series for how bad they can be, would have a great time watching Ace Attorney. It is truly bad. Hence it is truly great. It is a great mess that should be watched solely for that reason. Because quite frankly, that is the only way not to be dissapointed with what you get.

    OBJECTION! I received new evidence regarding this anime. The prosecution has been approached with the following review.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
These court cases are taken from the Ace Attorney games, but as I never played them, I have no idea how much they left out or added. Whatever, the laws of the court in this anime are pretty weird. Apparently every suspect is guilty untill proven innocent, and even when proven innocent, as long as you can&#039;t present the actual culprit, the verdict is still guilty. This is of course absolutely ridiculous and makes it nearly impossible to take this anime seriously. The rest is standard &quot;main character showed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230150">
        me the true meaning of (subject of anime)&quot; stuff.<br />
3/10<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Phoenix Wrigth doesn&#039;t look good. The characters often look very disfigured and there isn&#039;t much love to details either. They tried to mimic the movements from the game for the anime, which just looks awkward. The backgrounds are also rather static, which isn&#039;t much of a problem, but more visible in a subpar animated show like this.<br />
2/10<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
All the openings and endings are okay, though far from being great. I have no idea how one of them made it into the top 10 of the charts. Voice acting is okay too, there isn&#039;t much one can do with a one-dimensional character, so I can&#039;t critizise them for their work.<br />
5/10<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
You know why Detective Conan is so successful? Because not only does it have interesting cases, but also interesting characters, with motives, emotions and personalities. In Phoenix Wright there are only good and bad people. The motives often seem very disproportionate, which would not be all that bad if we had something to back up their actions. Even the main characters are rather lame. Naruhodo is a goody little two-shoes, Maya only cares about food and samurai and the prosecutors just want to win by all means.<br />
2/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Most cases were pretty boring and rather obvious to figure out who did it. Maybe this thing works as a game (and that seems to be the case, as many people love them), but as an anime, that is just not enough. The only case which I would consider good was the final one. Phoenix Wright is not insultingly bad (like Mayoiga for example), but there is nothing this show has to offer either.<br />
3/10<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
3.0/10

<br />
First of all, this anime is an insult to courts of law and judges. I know it doesn&#039;t reflect reality but using murder cases in this anime where they just seem to compete in who can make better statements is bad taste. Noone seems to care who is innocent (Naruhodo does but he just believes they are innocent and doesn&#039;t ask for any explanations).<br />
<br />
OST in this anime is good. Nothing extraordinary but didn&#039;t make me skip the OP or ED. Animation is poor. Too much still shots and visual effect is court are flashy but not very well done.<br />
<br />
Usually anime characters in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222148">
        power positions have a glaring fault and due to that it falls to MC to do things but in this case the judge is just dumb. He has no good qualities, how can someone who is timid and dumb become a judge, he could be one of them but not both. A procecutor who had 100% win rate and was suspected off tampering for evidence was not checked. All I want is some common sense and logic in this anime but I found none.<br />
<br />
The court system is so that people are convicted on circumstantial evidence unless the defence can show otherwise. And they aren&#039;t given much chance to do so. The jails must be full of innocent people because the detectives are quite bad too.<br />
<br />
Overall, I can never like a court drame where you can&#039;t take anything seriously.

    I didn&#039;t expect much out of this anime to begin with. Everyone wanted it, but from the very begginig I knew, that adapting the Pheonix Wright games was not the smartest idea. For the most part the story was pretty predictable, but I had hoped, that at least it would be a decent adaptation. I was wrong.<br />
<br />
NOTE: I boosted scores by about a half or so, because of the second to last arc, that actually was really good in every aspect. Most of the stuff I&#039;ll write below does not apply to that arc.<br />
<br />

-You never heard about Pheonix Wright. This anime does not have much to offer to you.<br />
<br />
Story: 5<br />
This is a mystery anime right? So why, for more than half of the cases, culprits are revealed at the beggining or in the middle of the investigation? It makes no sense. But hey, even if that wasn&#039;t the case, you can only guess who is the culprit, because most of the time, the evidence is provided way too late into the trial and at that point it&#039;s already obvious who did it. Though the cases can be interesting, the decisions that have been made concerning the story take away most of the fun of mystery anime, and leave you with a semi-decent drama. Also, let me mention the humour, that is at times decent and even better at a few select moments, but at others it feels incredibly misplaced. For example, a few seconds after an information about a murder occured, someone throws a joke. How can you laugh after someone told you that? I understand that it never is too serious to begin with, but when some events happen that are supposed to make you nervous, they don&#039;t, because you feel like it wasn&#039;t meant to do that. The games were never good in the story aspect, not counting a few cases, but this is a disaster. Overall, a first part of the long list of disappointments. The failed battle of silliness and seriousness does not help either.<br />
<br />
Art and Animation: 2<br />
This is an absolute disgrace when it comes to today&#039;s standards. Except for maybe Maya, everyone looks so wrong, and their animations are so weird. Even the main hero changes his face almost every scene. Honestly at some points it looks like some old animation from Newgrounds or something. It even made me burst out laughing because of how bad it was. It perfectly represents how little care was put into this. In the very last episode, the judge moves his mouth, but no voice can be heard, and the only sound is his hammer beating againts the palm of his hand. I usually leave the next part for the OST, so I though I&#039;ll mention it here. Overall, it&#039;s abysmal by today&#039;s standards. One or two scenes can&#039;t change that.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
It is.... good actually. The soundtrack from the game has been implemented here and the openings are catchy (the first opening ends in a weird, abrupt way though). There are some mistakes, the music at times doesn&#039;t fit the scenes and at some others it is dead quiet. In the last episode (again) there was clearly supposed to be a conversation, but instead we get a silent nod from a character. That lasts about 10-15 seconds. In complete silence. Some music would help at least, you know? Overall, pretty good, fails to fit sometimes.<br />
<br />
Characters: 4<br />
The characters were probably the strongest point of the games. Here they are bland and boring, maybe except Maya, but even she can often fall under that category. I did not care about anyone, they can all go disappear for all I care. No development, no interesting moments, nothing. They feel like butchered versions of themselves. I don&#039;t have anything else to add.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3<br />
The only redeeming factor was the circus arc that I mentioned at the beggining. If not for that, this would easily be a one. It&#039;s boring, painful to look at and overall just a huge disappointment. I did play the games and I was a little bit excited, but after the second arc, I ended up mindlessly grinding it to the finish line (except for the circus arc, it was a huge surprise to me really).<br />
<br />
Overall: 4<br />
It has nothing that I would consider worth recommending. I will never look back at it again. This is only watchable, if you played through the games and you want to see them turned into an anime. Everyone else might as well watch a field of flowers or something, I don&#039;t know. I could probably watch another season, it would cover my favourite game after all, but this one was a pain to watch. Glad it&#039;s over.<br />
<br />
Of course, this is purely my opinion, but I can&#039;t recommend you to develop your own. Watch at your own risk.

    This anime was my entry point to Ace Attorney as a whole, but I didn&#039;t spend much time watching it, because there is no point to it. The games are just so much better. <br />
<br />
The plot is pretty much adapted from the games, but the main issue here is that most of the cases feel rushed. The character development and jokes are all mushed together with all the facts of the case. Also cases that take like 5 hours to complete in the games, here are put in three 20 minute episodes. There&#039;s just not that much enjoyment from watching these be solved instead of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342765">
        solving them yourself. Don&#039;t get me wrong the anime is properly done it can keep you in suspense and be enjoyable. But there is a better alternative. <br />
<br />
The art is decent, although things in the distance tend to be very sloppily drawn. You can look at ace attorney from a little different perspective. The camera work is also good.<br />
<br />
In summery I can recommend this anime to people that are new to Ace Attorney. Just watch like 2 - 5 episodes. If you like the idea, then go play the games. The anime works best as an advertisement for the games. Also the English dub team has some hilarious outtakes, if you already played the games or watched the anime then go watch them on youtube! <br />

    I would&#039;ve given this a 4, but a 3 because I am an avid Ace Attorney fan for six to seven years, especially with the fact that this anime did not really do the main games any justice. Even, the walkthroughs on YouTube are better to watch. The anime is only decent if you really want to kill time, but it does not cut it for me.<br />
<br />
The games do have several puns and memes, so this anime was a letdown for me because the execution was poor. If anything, I only like the opening because of my Feenie x Edgeypoo fangirl heart.

    STORY (7): This anime has good storylines. It takes 3-4 episodes to cover each case. In some cases, it feels like it can drag on but they touch on the details. It can also be pretty intense in court (between the Prosecutor and Defense) -- especially when both sides have to yell object and prove their case. During the examination of each witness, each of them brings something different. In some cases, they would leave us second guessing ourselves, but it can also be predictable. <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS (7): They are numerous characters that are introduced in this series &amp; they have so much personalities.<br />
- Phoenix Wright

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230072">
        (Ryuichi): New Defense Attorney who works for Chihiro. He is very kind, helpful and understanding. P.W. is passionate for what he does &amp; has great deductive skills.<br />
- Mia Fey (Chihiro): Defense Attorney, beautiful &amp; intelligent. <br />
- Miles Edgeworth (Reiji): Crown Prosecutor and an old friend of Ryuichi. <br />
<br />
OVERALL (7): One of my favourite animes to watch. I can see that they use some of the video game&#039;s content onto the series. I pray that they will make another season! (&amp; possibly have a crossover with Professor Layton in the anime).

    I cannot believe that now this is over. Before I start this review I will say that I have personally not played the Ace Attorney series but I have seen playthroughs of the games. <br />
<br />
Story: If you have played the Ace Attorney games than this an adaptation of the first two games.  I feel that this was a good adaptation of the game but their was some stuff that I totally feel I agree with the community with. The Changes that were made to Ace Attorney that came throughout the series made this interesting because it changed the anime up a lot. The changes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230017">
        were small but it made me like this a lot.  The story I give a 9. <br />
<br />
Art: The animation of Ace Attorney was really great since you have the Objections that Wrights said and it was handled perfectly. The Art I give an 8. <br />
<br />
Sound: I could picture a dub for this anime being made since we got a picture of it in Dual Destinies. The Sub was not bad it just when you are used to hearing English voices from the games it an adjustment. Sound I give a 7. <br />
<br />
Characters: Every witness that is interrogated in the court room is what makes Ace Attorney. Everyone has a unique personality that makes it interesting. The characters I give a 10. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment and Overall: Overall I give this an 8, I cannot give this a perfect score because of flaws that are given in this adaptation. My enjoyment I give a 9 because I love this series and I feel I got the most out of this.

    &quot;It&#039;s only natural for living creatures to fight to protect their own lives. But what makes us human is that we fight for others.But who do you fight for? How hard must you fight...? That&#039;s the true measure of what human life is worth.&quot;- Phoenix Wright 2004<br />
<br />
  I am a big fan of Capcom&#039;s Ace Attorney series. With 6 mainline games, multiple spinoffs ,one crossover, an appearance in Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 and Project X Zone, it is safe to say this series is popular. The Ace Attorney franchise also has various manga, 2 Capcom licensed doujin collections, and now an anime. But

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275815">
        then the anime got trashed on and condemned as a bad adaptation. Now I Corey Censoredlastname will defend this animated adaptation of one of my favorite games.<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
   The story of the Ace Attorney franchise is really simple at face value, but the cases  go into great detail and have lots of amazing plot twists. Due to spoiler reasons, I will refrain from describing cases. The main premise is that Phoenix Wright is a new attorney at law, just having passed his bar exam. He is taken under the wing of defense attorney Mia Fey and she taught Phoenix to think outside the box, not take things at face value, and always believe in your client. The series goes into cross examination of witnesses to point out contradictory statements in their testimonies, Crime scene investigation, hilarious characters, spirit channelling, and defending the innocent. The Ace Attorney series is overall lighthearted, but at times it can get really dark. This anime adapted games 1 and 2.(Oh boy just wait for Farewell My Turnabout the final case in Justice for All and where the anime leaves off, it is my favorite case) 9/10 where the hell are the psyche locks in the anime.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
 The art is what really made this anime adaptation not as good as it should be. Characters go off model frequently, some characters dont look right (Larry is a prime suspect), and the CGI is absolute TRESH. The backgrounds do look nice, and the text from the games are translated well, and some of the dramatic effects are amazing. I just wish the art was as good as the sprites, or the cutscenes in Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice which are animated by the same studio how did they screw up this badly wtf.<br />
6/10 its passable, and some things are great.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The anime has some amazing sound design. The voice actors are amazing. Kaji Yuki as Phoenix was amazing. Better than those bit crushed GBA samples by a longshot. I am a big fan of his work so hearing him as Phoenix made me overjoyed. Edgeworth has a really good actor also, and Franziska has such a smug actress. The music is amazing too. As you know, the Ace Attorney franchise is well known for it&#039;s amazing music. The anime takes the approach to music similar to Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice, as all the music is orchestrated instead of using the GBA or DS ost and calling it a day. Holy shit the 2001 Objection theme never sounded more epic. And the Pursuit Cornered 2001 theme is amazing. Still can&#039;t beat the DS version of that song. However it seems that Justice For All&#039;s OST is mostly missing. That kinda sucks as I liked that game&#039;s OST a bit, and I&#039;ve heard the orchestral cd arrangements and it sounds amazing, and would sound amazing on TV. So the 2001 themes carry over to the Justice for All adaptation. So no Moderato 2002, or Pursuit Caught. I&#039;ll give it an 8 due to the missing music.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
The Characters are amazing listed below are main characters that do not spoil anything.<br />
<br />
Phoenix Wright: Newbie defense attorney who believes in his clients, and is highly intelligent, if a bit silly at times. He gets nervous, and is a friendly man. OBJECTION!!!!!<br />
<br />
Mia Fey: Phoenix&#039;s mentor. That&#039;s really all I can say without spoilers<br />
<br />
Larry Butz: Phoenix&#039;s best friend from gradeschool. Larry is a goofy and friendly character known to overreact, and has a bad track record of getting dumped. He is unlucky and always ends up in bad situations. If something smells, it&#039;s usually the Butz.<br />

Maya Fey: Phoenix&#039;s assistant who is a spirit medium in training. She is a comic relief character and is a very lovable person. She also has a bad track record being involved in many murder cases over the years. She loves hamburgers, ramen, and the Steel Samurai. She also seems to have a bit of a crush on &quot;Nick&quot;.<br />
<br />
Miles Edgeworth: Prosecutor who does almost anything to get a guilty verdict as he hates criminals. However he doesn&#039;t resort to any illegal tactics. He is also a really nice guy he just acts like an emo kid on their period. That autopsy report is outdated your honor.<br />
<br />
Franziska Von Karma: Tsundere prosecutor who is a really cool character. <br />
<br />
Dick Gumshoe, lovable detective who is a bit of a dope. He doesn&#039;t make much due to always getting paycuts. He looks up to Edgeworth a lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
I overall enjoy the anime adaptation. It was a well adapted version of the first two Ace Attorney games for the given episode count. I also like the fanservice of there even being a Phoenix Wright anime. Also here is a note, The bonus 5th case for the DS version of the first game, Case 5:Rise from the Ashes is missing. However I didn&#039;t like that case very much as it was really long and boring, but I did like Damon Gant so I am indifferent to it&#039;s exclusion. However the first case from Justice for All, &quot;The Lost Turnabout&quot; is missing, and this might pose a problem for the upcoming second season. I might not have liked that case much, but it introduced Maggey Byrd, a character who later reappears in the 3rd game as a waitress in Jean Armstrong&#039;s café. Also Richard Wellington had a hilarious breakdown. My enjoyment is an 8/10 but the critical score is a 7/10. It is not as bad as everyone says.<br />
<br />
The games are amazing though and way better so you should definitely play those. They are 10/10 material no joke.

    A lot of these low reviews come from people who haven&#039;t played the games, but I&#039;ve played them—all of them—and this is the definition of butchering a series. I&#039;m surprised the fandom was as forgiving of this adaptation.<br />
<br />
Nearly all of the problems from this stem from the difficulties of turning games that take more than 30 hours of pure gameplay to finish into a single season of a TV show. What made Ace Attorney memorable were the characters and the interactivity. Converting it to anime automatically loses the interactivity, so you lose the suspense or the feeling of being connected to the action. Then because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271011">
        it&#039;s rushed, plot holes are created and you lose a ton of characterization. What results is a rather boring show with 1-dimensional characters. Not to mention the animation is just bad. All around this was not a well-done adaptation.

    If you are a meticulous literature story/lore person and take everything seriously, this is not for you. Stay away from it. but if you want to find light and warm entertainment and not a very serious person, I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU THIS SERIES!<br />
<br />
For starters, I never play the game before, I don&#039;t know any single thing about whats Ace Attorney. The only thing I remember was around 8-10 years ago I occasionally saw thumbnails of the main character at youtube and several meme site.<br />
<br />
Anyway, last week I came across the dvd dual audio and decided to watch the series, in English by the way. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317191">
        learnt Japanese first then English, but I decided to give the English dub a try for this one.<br />
<br />
At first, this show looks realistic, its a story about lawyers fighting each other in court. I&#039;m an engineering graduate, I have little knowledge in law and especially court. Therefore, I don&#039;t really mind how the system is being used in the story, regardless its pure fiction or not.<br />
<br />
As soon as the part &quot;spirit medium&quot; is involved, I know this show is not something to be taken seriously, so I decided to let loose and not taking the whole thing seriously so it doesn&#039;t affect my enjoyment. Kids or people that too into literature will not find the story attractable and definitely won&#039;t like it too. <br />
<br />
But I need to remind you, this review come from someone whom:<br />
1. Never play the game<br />
2. Doesn&#039;t care regardless its realistic or not (ex: spirit medium involvement)<br />
as some people would say its &quot;ridiculous&quot; , but not me, I&#039;ll allow it and take it as part of entertainment and enjoyment.<br />
<br />
So, my enjoyment? I give it 8/10 overall.<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
1. I like the English dialogues and the interactions, its written and played in a very enjoyable manner! (good job voice actors!)<br />
<br />
2. I like how the story gradually become one, piece by piece, and we ends up see the whole picture as we progress through the episodes.<br />
<br />
3. I personally like the setting, such as our main character being an adult pass 20 yrs old, freshly graduated college student. (I generally have no feelings to highschool settings anymore)<br />
<br />
4. After some research, i found out that this &quot;first season&quot; cover the first two game of Phoenix Wright, of which some people would call &quot;bright side of the story&quot;. I enjoyed every parts of elements presented, theres both serious and hilarious moment I personally very enjoyed. One thing very memorable for me in this first season is Wendy Oldbag, shes so funny hahah. and not to mention, all those funny characters faces during funny moments, its all enjoyable.<br />
<br />
5. I like the development, I can see that the main character is gradually becoming more matured throughout the series. and I really like it. Also, there were some characters bond getting stronger with each other as the story progress. Friendship is the story&#039;s main arsenal to present to its audience. You will see if you watch this adaptation.<br />
<br />
<br />
and I think thats all , for now. I really like this adaptation, to the point I want to get to know the story&#039;s continuation by playing the game, but I&#039;ll do that after the anime second season.<br />
<br />
Watch this for fun, you will enjoy it! as I enjoyed it so much!<br />

    I decided to do a quick review of an anime I dropped, please note I haven&#039;t seen all of the episodes or played the games, but I&#039;m sure I have a basic understanding. <br />
<br />
Story (4) - An attorney getting clues and defending someone? Sounds, great honestly. I would give it an 8 but, the execution is god awful. It&#039;s nothing more then a being mess with no attempts for jokes or character development, it&#039;s more of a thing that happened then the characters just move on. They forget about that the next episode.<br />
<br />
Art (2) - I love is art style of a video game, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review234259">
        that&#039;s the only good thing about it. The art can be awkward and still at times that I wish I could look away but I can&#039;t then I&#039;m stuck with a headache. Sometimes the animation looks odd as well, like in the opening.<br />
<br />
Sound (8) - Easily the best part about this show, the voice actors and actresses do an amazing job on there parts. Listening to the opening and closing of each episode is the best part of each episode. They don&#039;t sound grading to the ears! It sounds like effort has been put into them!<br />
<br />
Character (1) - Uh... who are these people? The characters in this show are so, boring. It makes each episode go for longer and longer. Mr. Attorney Can&#039;t Remember His Real Name Man is the blandest and the most forgettable of them all, at least the other characters seem cool and heck maybe even OKAY but since THIS guy is our main character we have to follow him around and hope he does something another then some random stuff that&#039;s ends up working in the end.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (3)<br />
<br />
Overall (2) - If you&#039;re drink and bored, THEN watch this anime but if you aren&#039;t both of those things kindly run away from this monsterpiece of a show.

    Really good anime that does the games justice. (Did I really just make that joke?) The music was great, the characters were very entertaining, and the story was extremely engaging. Episode 13 in particular was really heartfelt and shed some light on the Phoenix/Ryuichi&#039;s backstory. Highly recommend to fans to the series, as well as newcomers who want to get into Ace Attorney. <br />
<br />
It starts out like the first game, where we see a young woman get killed in her own apartment, and the murderer stating he&#039;ll pin it on Larry Butz, Phoenix/Ryuichi&#039;s best friend. As you may guess, Phoenix must prove Larry&#039;s innocence to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307089">
        avoid him from being sentenced to prison.<br />
<br />
The anime is charming and comical, much like the games, and it really makes being a lawyer look cool as heck (keeping it kid-friendly, I like it).<br />
<br />
Overall, great anime with fun mysteries that will keep anyone entertained. 10/10.

    Let me start off by saying that I have not played Ace Attorney. I know some things about it from friends that have played the game, but characterization, plot, story elements and the like are foreign to me.<br />
<br />
Story - Strong 6 - Weak 7<br />
Obviously there are only a few cases a season, and this show would have benefited from the long running format of TV anime. But it was decided to make this a seasonal show and so be it. It think the show does its best to speed through the elements it has and while they aren&#039;t always done well, I&#039;d say they&#039;re entertaining.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305953">
        Although I can see why people who had played the game might be frustrated at the cut down abridged versions of their favorite characters.<br />
<br />
The first episode is... It&#039;s bad. It&#039;s rushed, obviously to set the formula for the series and establish characters and set pieces before launching into it&#039;s first big case. If you already knew the Ace Attorney games, I&#039;d say you could even skip the first episode entirely which isn&#039;t a good thing.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cases are pretty decent though. While I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible to figure it out the solution most of the time, I also don&#039;t think the show is working under the illusion that it wants you to? It would have made the show better, but i don&#039;t think it detracts too much.<br />
<br />
Art - strong 6<br />
Look. There&#039;s like maybe three locations in an episode and the background for the courtroom are used repeatedly. But the art looks fine. There isn&#039;t any problems with perspective and key frames are all good. There are even some nice dramatic rotating shots used far more appropriately than in other shows (it should be noted these are all done in the courtroom, where everything at least has a 3D model to reference off)<br />
<br />
Nothing particularly of note.<br />
<br />
sound - 4<br />
It&#039;s not bad sound. The sound effects are just all ripped directly from the game. There&#039;s very little inspiration here. <br />
<br />
character - 6<br />
The characters here are not the characters from the games. They are far simpler and straight forward because the show doesn&#039;t have enough time to elaborate as much as it would like. They aren&#039;t exactly begging your investment. But they serve to get the story across.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 9<br />
I love it. It&#039;s fun, it&#039;s stupid. It has immense trouble trying to summarize the excuses for it&#039;s plot inconsistencies. I often have fun with not quite average anime. I do not think someone who loves the games will find the enjoyment that is probably tainting my review in their watch, because of the sacrifices made.<br />
<br />
Overall - 6<br />
So in summary<br />
 - Story is cut down from source material and this weakens the plot slightly<br />
 - Art is of average quality for this studio and did not impact the viewing experience negatively<br />
   - It should be noted the rotating shots are of good quality and appropriately used.<br />
 - Sound is fine, OPs are of decent quality. I didn&#039;t watch the EDs...<br />
 - Characters are a little flat, thiss does somewhat detract from the experience<br />
 - I enjoy this far too much<br />
<br />
It could have been better,  could have been worse. Just a little better then average due to it&#039;s animation and presentation.

    *MINOR SPOILERS, NOT TOO BAD*<br />
6/10<br />
As someone who is a very big Ace Attorney fan, I was very surprised to hear that people were so disappointed in this anime adaptation of the first game. The first time I saw it, I personally thought it to be an enjoyable experience overall. However, I do have to admit that it went on the Persona 5 route when it came to artwork and design.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack, on the other hand, is pretty great. Thankfully, they&#039;re not just re-using the low-quality GBA/DS samples for the soundtrack and actually have put in the tiniest amount of effort to remaster certain tracks. Pursuit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361299">
        and Objection are my favorites, although I really like what they did with DL-6 and the Steel Samurai theme. Also, there are brand-new tracks that usually match up to the standards of the originals, and these were great. I really liked the orchestral feel of the soundtrack.<br />
<br />
The story is virtually the same as the games, but cramming in the first and second games into a mere 24 episodes definitely hurt the experience. I would not recommend anyone to watch the Ace Attorney anime before playing the games. The amount of aspects cut-out in place of really strange additions was too much for me. You could point a gun to my head and I still wouldn&#039;t be able to tell you why Maya goes to the Prosecutor&#039;s Office to obtain the DL-6 pistol and bullet and why Larry disguises himself as Edgey. The changes truly hurt the experience. Also, as is to be expected with a format change from a videogame to an anime, major events are less impactful and emotional.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: I did watch the dub instead of sub because that&#039;s how I like experiencing media that I began in one language. The English voice actors were really good at certain points, though you cannot get me to like Helium Maya. Maximillion Galactica, Edgeworth, Gumshoe, among others are some of my favorites. I did see a few clips of the JP version, and I personally do not like how high-pitched Phoenix&#039;s voice is. Maya sounds way cuter, at least.<br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t have enough time to replay the games, watch the anime. It&#039;s good for experiencing the games once more if you don&#039;t really care about getting the full experience.<br />
<br />
(sorry if this review is bad, this is my first one)
