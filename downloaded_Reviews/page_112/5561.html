    Okay let me say first that i really enjoyed this show so i&#039;m obviously biased but who cares if i&#039;m biased?<br />
<br />
The story is simple and philosophically deep but lacking at the same time, that&#039;s probably the only weak point of this show for me. I really do wish they do more on the story department but given the source material, there really wasn&#039;t much.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Black King&quot; starts with the concept that &quot;the world will end one day&quot;. Which is true, we know everything and everyone dies. Even the Sun that can lives for billions of years will die one day. *Everything is destine to ends*

          <span style="display: none;" id="review245147">
        that&#039;s the message.<br />
<br />
But another thing is also true, we as a humanity will try to survive even if everything is going to end, even for only a small amount of time. Which is &quot;Hope&quot; represented by the Protagonists.<br />
<br />
The story is not about &quot;good vs bad&quot; as many people mistakenly taken it to be. It&#039;s about &quot;Hope vs Despair&quot; which is similar but not exactly the same and that&#039;s the key point that this show has taken my heart.

    Mobile game adaptations are few and far in between, and they all fall into one of two categories.  Either they&#039;re of average quality yet manage to garner a huge amount of popularity due to its characters (Kancolle/Love Live), or no one gives two shits about them because they&#039;re so bad no one cares (Girlfriend Kari).  So, how does Chain Chronicle, the lovechild between Alim and Sega that no longer has any global servers on the west coast because fuck you westerners, fare in all of this?<br />
<br />
Story: Alright, because the anime doesn&#039;t give any context, and various synopsis&#039; beyond &quot;This is an adaptation of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243545">
        a game&quot; definitely don&#039;t help, here&#039;s the story of Chain Chronicle in a nutshell.  The world has the looming threat of blackness threatening to cover the world in its evil.  The Black King of all of this is the source, and it&#039;s up to Yuuri (aka the player character given a face) to stop him.  Along the way, you meet a girl named Phoena who has lost her memory carrying a book known as the &#039;Chain Chronicle&#039;, and a sprite named Pirika, as well as various other characters that you&#039;ll meet through the use of gacha roll.  So now that you&#039;ve gotten your merry band of RNG rolled units, fight through hordes of nameless enemies and fight the Black King.  Have fun.  <br />
<br />
That was a quick rundown of the start of Chain Chronicle.  The start of the anime is a bit more complicated.  The anime starts at the end of the story that I explained above and eventually leads into the second half of the story where the situation of the world is dire, and Yuuri must find his bearing and return to fight the Black King again.  The initial problem here is the assumption that the viewer knows what the hell is going on at the start.  The show thrusts you into the action without any word of warning, before continuing on with a journey that was started without the audience even knowing.  I&#039;m not sure what went through the creators&#039; heads when they started to make this, because everything from the world to what&#039;s happening is made to feel already established some time previous when it&#039;s barely even past episode two.  <br />
<br />
Another issue is the pacing.  The beginning is very sluggish, as the show inches its way to making any form of progress before speeding up through the plot through the use of deus ex machina in order to make any form of progression happen, and the end is very fast paced as it tries to rush itself to the end.  This is due to the fact that the series has its characters in the majority of its episodes just travel from one place to another with the occasional conflict in between to make it feel like there&#039;s something actually happening, before creating a large total conflict to make it seem like everything is on the line.  This, combined with the generic plotline of a hero and his band of friends fighting the evil king at the end of the journey, makes the whole viewing experience feel bland and boring to watch.  <br />
<br />
Overall, Chain Chronicle: Light of Haecceitas is a mishmash of fantasy tropes traveling long hours in a fantasy setting with fantasy characters fighting the big evil fantasy guy at the end who wants to destroy everything because people suck and he doesn&#039;t like it.  Its message is typical shonen friend crap, its plot is predictable, no one that matters dies (surprise surprise), and it&#039;s just...not at all a fun watch cause there&#039;s nothing interesting about it.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
- Generic fantasy adventure <br />
- Terrible start because they throw the audience into the fire<br />
- Uneven pacing<br />
- Way too much deus ex machina<br />
<br />
Characters:  Fantasy characters with shonen tropes!  Yeah, that about sums them up.  <br />
<br />
Yuuri is...one of our main characters.  As the player character tasked with being the player&#039;s in-game representation and by &#039;recruiting&#039; people through the use of in-game microtransactions that may or may not give you the character that you want (oh how I feel that pain), Yuuri is...not interesting at all.  He fights for his friends, on the side of good, and halfway through the series, doubts himself and manages to pull off an extremely &#039;meh&#039; character change that doesn&#039;t amount to anything in the end.  <br />
<br />
Aram is the other main character in this series.  Despite having a character design that I&#039;m actually quite fond of, Aram&#039;s character leaves a lot to be desired.  He&#039;s basically a brasher version of Yuuri, as he holds the same morals and ideals as his friend.  Does this make him a better character in any way?  No.  Does this make him interesting?  No.  Will we be moving on to our last character?  Yes.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s Phoena who&#039;s literally just there.  Phoena doesn&#039;t really play much of a big part in this series and is more or less there because she&#039;s the heroine and holds the Chain Chronicle, the brick of text this series is named after.  She plays a bit like a damsel in distress as she cannot fight and is stuck to the role as that one girl who screams out the protagonist&#039;s name whenever the situation for them looks dire, and only becomes relevant to the series when the book she clutches to her chest is involved.  <br />
<br />
Every other character is just one fantasy trope after another.  The brave knight, the fallen knight, the holy queen, the evil bitch who&#039;s basically naked, the healer, the archer, the big scary evil guy who turns into a dragon at the end (why is this a common trope), the good dragon, the songstress, old sages, pervy sage, various mages, weaponmasters, someone who actually is naked (they even point this out), the conquerer guy, etc, etc.  The majority of these characters are either skin deep NPCs that do one thing for the plot before becoming irrelevant, or are members of the gacha that you could &#039;potentially&#039; (cause let&#039;s be real, you&#039;re not gonna get them) roll and add to your squad.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+/- Fantasy tropes.  Entertaining?  Yes.  Good characters?  No.<br />
<br />
Art: Produced by Telecom Animation Film, Chain Chronicle actually doesn&#039;t look all too bad.  Granted it&#039;s more or less standard fare for this age of animation, but the art and action are all fairly well done and consistent.  <br />
<br />
For one thing, the show manages to pull off CGI well enough to not create a clear contrast with the handdrawn scenes, and they show off the game&#039;s mana system and chain battle system pretty well.  (In a nutshell, you get orbs to do super attacks.  Doing multiple super attacks in succession has better effects.)  Not only that, but the sheer ridiculousness of the majority of the character designs are well done as well.  Yes, while the fantasy outfits that these characters wear both look ridiculous and impractical for battle, they look pretty nice.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Consistent art<br />
+ Detailed designs<br />
+ CGI doesn&#039;t clash<br />
<br />
Sound:  On the flipside, the OST isn&#039;t great.  Both the OP and ED are these rock songs that aren&#039;t very enjoyable to listen to.  They feel extremely average and there&#039;s nothing lost in skipping them.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment: I played Chain Chronicle while they had servers over in the west.  Alim closed the servers long ago, so playing the game in the west is now impossible.  Though I didn&#039;t play for long, the residual memory of my experience with it got me excited when I saw that there was going to be an adaptation.  And after I saw it?  I&#039;m thoroughly disappointed.  This adaptation is strange because not only does it begin halfway through the main story, but they just compiled the Chain Chronicle movies into an anime adaptation.  The strange circumstances combined with what part of the story they decided to adapt almost made me feel like they didn&#039;t really care when they made this because everything felt thrown together.  Safe to say, I was not impressed with this anime and it was not worth the time to watch.<br />
<br />
Did I like this anime?<br />
<br />
Well...I like some of the character designs?  That&#039;s something I guess.<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this anime?<br />
<br />
I hated how boring it felt.  The entire show was just characters moving from one place to another before the big fight at the finale.  This with the lack of world building due to the fact that the show feels like it expects you to know what&#039;s going on and who is whom makes the hard for those unfamiliar with the series to watch.  I believe an adaptation should be able to be viewed by all, and the fact that Chain Chronicle doesn&#039;t do that makes it seem like they only did this for those who were fans of the series.  Which makes sense, but you&#039;d still want to try and get new people into it too, right?<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this anime?<br />
<br />
To both people who have or haven&#039;t played the game, no.  This show is not worth your time, as its bland character motivations and sluggish plot progression don&#039;t do anything imaginative or interesting beyond &#039;this is what&#039;s going on.&#039;  If you want something fantasy, I&#039;d highly suggest watching something else because nothing about this is good.  Now I understand why Alim isn&#039;t able to fix Brave Frontier...

Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari is how you would imagine if Lord of the Rings would have an anime. The anime started off with the bad guy actually triumph over the good guy, and the land is slowly turning into darkness. Yet per usual, that would not stop our band of heroes from trying to stop the villains, because hey, who else gonna do it right? It is a purely adventure anime set in the fantasy world (finally without the isekai elements) and a good one at that. The animation is really good, especially in every fight scene, and it feels like some kind of

        rpg video games at time. The movie version is basically the first 4 episode of the anime, so for people who have already watched it, just wait and skip to ep 5. Picked up because I really thirst for some good adventure anime.<br />

    **THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS**<br />
<br />
Chain Chronicle is an adaptation of a mobile game of the very same name. The mobile game has been adapted into a short ova and a movie trilogy, and that movie trilogy has now been broken down into a 12 ep anime (or maybe is what the other way around). Anyway coming into this i wasn&#039;t sure how to approach it either by the movies or the tv series, so I choose the slow burner method and picked the tv series.<br />
<br />
The beginning of the show puts you immediately in the thick of a large battle which I believe for the characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243534">
        is the final grand battle against the dark king (or whatever his name was). However, by the end of the battle the heroes have lost the battle and the dark king has now grown more powerful than ever. The army now disbanded the group of heroes now have to regroup, and find another way to defeat the dark king and convince the army to fight once more.<br />
<br />
Very few anime that I know have the protagonist and his group lose a key battle especially so it being the very first episode. However by doing so the show loses many vital things such as world building and the buildup that could have happened for the battle making it feel like I somehow skipped over the first or so seasons. I guess that the first part of the story is in the mobile game, but an anime has to stand on its own in order to be considered a proper adaptation and not one long glorified infomercial. <br />
<br />
The world building is lost in the sense that the viewer has no idea what is going on in the world other than there&#039;s a dark king and different factions and races uniting together, but none of these are explored in the anime. As for the buildup they lost it in the sense that it would have been better if the first &quot;final battle&quot; was built up yet they lost the battle at the mid way point, and for them to do it again, and have the viewers think whether or not they can they really pull it off this time despite all the build up from last time. However since we just skip over that, now you already get a feeling that they will succeed which lowers the tension of the show.<br />
<br />
The show pretty much boils down to the characters trying to have the faction rejoin and find another way to take down the king, they meet a kid who resembles the protagonists. There&#039;s some &quot;betrayal&quot; in the group, there&#039;s some battles yet they all look the same, and the final battle that ends with one of the main characters raseganing the big bad, the end, oh and every one is ok. The story felt incomprehensible at points as I believe that the show was made for people who already have knowledge of what is going on. However even though I had liitle idea what was going on, even I know that there was a lot of bullshit going on in the story with characters popping in and out of nowhere in order for the plot to keep moving forward, and made the story feel rushed just to get it over with.<br />
<br />
The same reasoning I had for the story can also be applied to the characters since you needed to have played the game in order to have a grasp of most the characters. The titular characters in the show are the three main protagonist Yuri the hero swordsman, Arma an &quot;interesting&quot; thief, Phoena, the chronicle cleric. Then there&#039;s Juliana a princess, Shuza the leader of the ogres, and I guess burckhardt the princess bodyguard. Everyone else one else is one-note either filling in some character class, or as elders/ guardians of a location. He shows has a huge roster of characters but none of them are decently fleshed out or if they ever get fleshed out at all( i guess you have to check the game).<br />
 <br />
Yuri the hero was a somewhat interesting character in the start of the story after having lost in the &quot;final&quot; battle has sort of a ptsd like effect on him, and has doubt if he&#039;s worthy to become a hero to the point of siding with the dark king, but this gets swept under the rug fast because what was causing it all along was magic~~~. The same happens to burckhardt as a foreshadowing, but he wasn&#039;t much of a character in the first place. Arma our &quot;newest&quot;companion (like the others weren&#039;t new enough) joins the group and has a power that is rather convenient for the story, not much is looked into him other than being another shounen like protagonist. Phoena ,who is waifu material, is the keeper of the chronicle and also the daughter of the king which would be very interesting plot point but is glossed over. Also it&#039;s her and yuris fault for failing in the first place because if they waited just a little more maybe they could have taken him down with the help of the rest of the group. Juliana and Shuza are just leaders of to large groups ones &quot;kind&quot; ones a &quot;dick&quot; respectively. There&#039;s nothing notable about the antagonists the dark king just comes off as a half price pain from naruto, and there&#039;s also a demon lady who convinces the characters to be evil. They&#039;re just evil for the sake of evil. the betrayers have more depth than them, and that&#039;s not saying much.<br />
<br />
For a commercial it&#039;s pretty good for modern anime standard. I do like the character designs as they were made by the same person who did Maoyū Maō Yūsha(which you should watch instead of this). There&#039;s notable usage of CGI for the dragons and the action scenes, but nothing bad upon the eyes. The background is okay, but as I said before in the world building since there&#039;s none of it here all the places just seem like a generic fantasy setting and the locations as set pieces. This shows even more in the large battles which all seem to all take place in large gray areas with a dark sky<br />
<br />
in terms of sound, it&#039;s very good for a fantasy anime. It has the triumphed music for when the characters are winning. Some despairing music when the characters are in a jam some whimsical fantasy village and inn music during the lighthearted moments, and all of this wrapped up with one singing elf. The voice acting is also fine as well.<br />
<br />
In the end I gave up taking this &quot;seriously*, and just laughed at all the bullshit that came my way<br />
<br />
Overall- it&#039;s a 3/10 as an anime, but a 10/10 for a commercial for a product I will never buy.﻿

    Western Chain Chronicle fans rejoice! After the mobile game shut down their servers after introducing fans to the world of Yggdra many fans had to say goodbye to the colourful cast of characters, but can now experience the vibrant world in a new light.<br />
<br />
The story follows an alternative events where the Volunteer Army fails to defeat the Black king in the final battle of the game. Confronted with this, they must deal broken alliance and the frayed hope of the nation. As the they regroup and lick their wounds a potential new recruit enters the fray.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story = 7<br />
Like all modern fantasy, the influence of Tolkien&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239732">
        work can be found mixed in the usual slew of anime tropes for good measure. Game mechanics are added quite well into the story and do not seem to interfere or drag the plot down.<br />
<br />
The story does, however, suffer most in the first episode, as it was clearly made for fans of the game, no backstory beyond a short introduction is given. Any outsiders to this may find the beginning slightly confused as you are thrown directly into Final Battle of the game itself. By the time opening theme starts, they story breaks new ground and all the interesting stuff begins to happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art = 9<br />
The art of the show really stays true to that of the mobile game. Characters have been faithfully adapted along with stunning backgrounds. It also makes use of 3D models mixed with the overall 2D art style (a nod to the 3D models in the game perhaps?). New takes on environments are presented and game locations are expanded to fit into the paradigm of the show.<br />
<br />
All in all, the animation studio has done a fantastic job of incorporating a substantial amount of game art and expanding it into a believable, living world.<br />
<br />
Sound = 7<br />
Admittedly, not much to say. The soundtrack suits each location effectively and the opening theme makes you want mash some baddie&#039;s face in; so job done right? <br />
<br />
<br />
Character = 8<br />
This was the strongest point of the game for me, characters each had a rich background and were very likeable. The most boring character was the &#039;Hero&#039;, which the anime addresses to perfection. Gone is the mostly silent protagonist without a name and enter the newly dubbed Yuri, a character that has to deal with the burden&#039;s of loss and the need for hope.<br />
<br />
Also, any (though it still is early) we may yet get the much Googled and sought after character arc of the fallen hero. This is based on the general direction of the series and the poster for Part 3 of the movie. Rejoice fans of Kaneki Ken and Darth Vader, we might just have a keeper on hands!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment = 10<br />
I loved the game, I love the anime. There is no doubt I&#039;m giving this a ten, call me a fan boy if you want. The new perspectives on the characters I followed for two years only made me love this more, I&#039;ll even buy the T-shirt.<br />
<br />
Joking aside, the anime makes for a great action adventure show. The characters and artwork stays faithful to the source material and a good adaptation. I would happily recommend it to anyone looking for a good fantasy or adventure tale.<br />
<br />
Overall = 8<br />
I will admit, there is a certain amount of bias here. Chain chronicle to me was an introduction to the world of Japanese animation, and really sparked my passion for it. Any fans of the game may also feel abounded joy of the return of Chain Chronicle, while other viewers might not get what the heck we&#039;re going on about.<br />
I would recommend this anime to anyone without a doubt, putting aside the first episode&#039;s pandering to returning fans, the following episodes make for a good anime. So, please, give it a go.<br />
<br />
[I will post recommendations for the anime as new episodes are released. Good to have you back!]

    ENG-The story is pretty classic and boring. The hero who believes in the hope that must beat the great villain of despair with the power of friendship. It&#039;s seen and already seen.<br />
From an artistic point of view, this anime is rather good. The animations are fluid. However, there are some errors in some passages.<br />
The sounds and voices are also good. Despite the fact that in my opinion Ishida Akira (whom I admire) is not meant to be Yuri&#039;s voice.<br />
The characters are very numerous and detailed: congratulations to the character-design team who had to work very hard.<br />
I enjoyed this anime because even if it is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265188">
        basic story, it remains good and pleasant to follow.<br />

FR-L&#039;histoire est plûtot classique et ennuyante. Le héros qui croit en l&#039;espoir qui doit battre le grand méchant du désespoir à l&#039;aide du pouvoir de l&#039;amitié. C&#039;est du vu et déjà vu.<br />
D&#039;un point de vu artistique, l&#039;animé est plutôt bon. Les animations sont fluides. Cependant, il y quelques erreurs dans certains passages. <br />
Les sons et voix sont aussi bons. Malgré le fait que selon moi Ishida Akira (que j&#039;admire) n&#039;est pas fait pour être la voix de Yuri.<br />
Les personnages quand à eux sont très nombreux et détaillés : félicitation à l&#039;équipe de character-design qui a du travailler très dure.<br />
J&#039;ai apprécié cet animé car même si c&#039;est une histoire basique, elle en reste bonne et agréable à suivre.

But please, hear me out.<br />

I decided to write a review after episode 6 left me in tears.<br />
<br />
(Skip this part if you don&#039;t like background stories)<br />
Man, this brings back memories. I was one of the few that enjoyed the English server of the mobile game. The strong suit of the game is the story itself. I was truly immersed on the world of yggdra through storytelling alone. My heart broke into pieces when I heard about the server shutdown. By that time, the devs made

          <span style="display: none;" id="review245726">
        all map energy cost into 1 so everyone can &quot;Enjoy&quot; the last moments of the game.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t. I uninstalled the game right after hearing that. <br />
<br />
By no means that I liked what I did, it broke me. As exaggerated as it may sound, it left a hole in my chest. What was once included in my daily routine, now gone. I felt like I broke up with 5 girlfriends compressing all that feelings into one instance. Until now I never found a mobile game to replace this particular hole in my heart.<br />
(Skip this part if you don&#039;t like background stories)<br />
<br />
Now enter the anime. I was hyped to hear about the anime, but was keeping a low steady expectation due to it being a game adaptation. An android game to boot. Adaptations never get the anticipation fans are expecting. For one, that is actually our fault. The game and the anime have different ways of delivering the message to the audience, (Check out MatPat&#039;s vid about adaptations for detailed explanation) but this adaptation took me into a whole new world. A Darker one to boot. <br />
<br />
*Contains some spoilers from the game*<br />
<br />
The end of Chapter 1 for the Mobile game has you, the hero, defeating Black King. The twist and turns of the whole book one unfolds into the last chapter, Black King being revealed as Phoena&#039;s father, and Black Knight being Yuri from a different Chain Chronicle world. The anime tackled a different route, where Yuri didn&#039;t defeat the Black King right then and there. Yes, the story may have turned into a darker path but I enjoyed it as to how it shows that the franchise itself had grown and matured to tackle on a darker light. <br />
<br />
While it&#039;s a shameless attempt into pulling anime fans into the game, it is indeed actually recommended that you finish Book 1 and as many character story possible. You will appreciate all the anime has to offer. For one, Julianna&#039;s story line in the game was actually one of the driving force for her to take on the Throne. Shuza&#039;s Nine Territories&#039; storyline shows when and how the two joined forces to fight the Black King.<br />
<br />
Seeing all that connections, all that immersions, being twisted in a different, dark light gives a whole new rejuvenating enjoyable new experience the anime adaptation has to offer. <br />
<br />
*Update*<br />
<br />
I have to admit. Aram is really a big ass pull character. I wished his backstory and how his powers came to be was explained more clearly.<br />
<br />
I hope this somehow helped you into reconsidering to rewatch the series with all the points in mind. It saddens me that the score is dwindling down. Though I must admit, I will rate this 6/10 if I don&#039;t have any background in the game. I&#039;ve seen it firsthand while watching some of the episodes with others that don&#039;t have the game background simply bored out and start spacing out mid episode. But as to how each episodes tug into my heart and my emotion, I just won&#039;t take it to look at this series going down without a fight (or atleast an explanation).

    [UPDATED]<br />
CHAIN CHRONICLE ANIME REVIEW<br />
<br />
I&#039;m writing this after marathoning the series in one go. As well as without the knowledge of the Movie adaptations nor playing the game of Chain Chronicle.<br />
<br />
Chain Chronicle: Light of Haecceitas revolves around Yuri, Aram, Phoena and the Black King Suppression Army in dealing and fighting against the Black King and his Army.<br />
<br />
In the first episode, we saw a glimpse of Yuri and the others losing to the Black King. So basically, the whole plot of the series is gathering back again the others in order to try to defeat again the Black King. Did it went smoothly the second time around?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review245050">
        Find out for yourself.<br />
<br />
Like I said before, since it was based on a game don&#039;t expect much of a storyline. Though the story ins&#039;t that great and kinda feels pathetic, the animations and fight scenes was damn great. It overhauls for its poor storyline. It kinda feels like I&#039;m playing a video game. The soundtrack is good as well. Especially the opening and ending themes.<br />
<br />
Another thing about this anime is that we&#039;ve been introduced to too many extra characters that doesn&#039;t blend well to the story. Especially in the latter part of the anime.<br />
<br />
Overall, it was a decent anime to me. It is not highly recommended but it can at least be on your watch list for its superb animation and soundtrack as well as a decent amount of enjoyment.

    Despite a rather simplistic storyline and transparent events, the series as a whole meets everything you&#039;re looking for a in a &quot;good vs evil&quot; shounen sort of anime. The narrative begins at an end and continues from there, fulfilling its own promise of an unending battle of hope and belief against anguish and doubt. <br />
<br />
A boyhood adventure told through an epic narrative, Chronicle will no doubt disappoint someone looking for a groundbreaking, genre-defining series. It never promises to be that and the first few minutes of the series make that evident. The rogue, the tank, and the fighter, supported by their healer and the feminine

          <span style="display: none;" id="review248895">
        foil confront a great evil and despite their wholehearted efforts, they fall short. So begins our story, an &quot;Odyssey&quot; rather than an &quot;Iliad&quot;. Like the greater epic&#039;s narrative that influences this, the writers assume you can tell who the characters are from design. The core characters see face-value development to satisfy the narrative, the trials and tribulations they face as they struggle to face their ultimate enemy are metaphors overcome by the timely arrival of an ally and the heroes&#039; innate heroism. The hero dallies with Circe, overcomes the temptation into nihilism, and returns triumphant with his romanticism restored. <br />
<br />
Chronicle delivers on its promise: an action filled, grand-scale story with a satisfying ending. It reaffirms what its audience is told to believe and redemption for those who fall promises the doubters among us are not yet lost. The animation is well-done, the soundtrack impressive enough to carry along the simplicity of the story, and the characters fulfill their roles without fail. Chronicle is a 12-episode romantic narrative, ideals of faith, belief, and fellowship cast into a group of characters we already know without knowing them themselves. <br />
<br />
Enjoy Chronicle for what it is and accept, as the writers did, that it is not special, unique, or particularly well-developed. It doesn&#039;t need to be. Chronicle retells a story told for thousands of years and does it with enough bells and whistles to keep the audience engaged. Some serious moments fall painfully flat, the dialogue is laughable at times, and the trope abuse overwhelming for those unwilling to lose themselves in its romanticism. For the rest of us, willing to suspend our jaded, postmodern skepticism and need for elaborate, painstakingly contriving magic performances, Chronicle is a satisfying, self-fulfilling stage and worth the 6 hours invested.

    I am still searching for an action fantasy anime that will literary blow my mind with its awesomeness, and believe it or not, this anime had potential to do so. But man, they really screwed up the anime at some points and made it a little less enjoyable than I expected it to be. <br />
<br />
<br />
PLOT &amp; STORY LINE 📜<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
The first and probably the major issue that this show has is that the first episode looks like a mid-seasonal highlight. You play the episode and out of nowhere you have the protagonist fighting alongside his companions against the main villain of the show. He wants some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250281">
        sacred book, the world is becoming dark, some fairy (that seems very important) suddenly disappears and you&#039;re just watching and thinking...wait what? I had the feeling that I missed out on something and I did. It has a prequel from 2014. But that 1h long Short Animation didn&#039;t give me any insight to to story. Now that is some plot hole, don&#039;t you think? It is like half of the season is missing. But what is it now about?<br />
<br />
<br />
The story starts off, as I said, with our main characters of the Volunteer Army fighting the Dark King and loosing. As mentioned, some little fairy disappears and a very important book called the Chronicle is split into two. The Chronicle is said to hold the entire history of the world and if it were to be stained black, the whole world would too fall into darkness. One half is now in possession of the Dark King and after the battle ends in a big loss for the Volunteer Army, they were forced to retreat. Yet their hope did not disappear entirely and so they set off on another journey to find Pirika (the lost fairy) and gather more allies for their upcoming fight with the Dark King. <br />
Even though the anime has a really messed up story line, it still got a 8/10 from me in the MAL rating, and here&#039;s all why:<br />
<br />
1. The fantasy-magic setting of Chain Chronicle is one of the best I have ever seen. I know I have seen such setting in a lot anime, but this one special in some way. First of all the powers are based on both magic and mana-powered swordsmanship that just looks so amazing in the fight sequences. The world it self is extremely interesting seeing all the different regions from desserts to forests. I just hoped they had put more effort in the details of each of the seven regions and their rulers. The setting was fantastic and the anime was magical. I loved the fights and enjoyed every battle each of which was epic and thrilling at the same time. <br />
<br />
2. The cliche hero-friendship bond story was not boring and irritating as it happens to be in most other anime. The core and in some way the moral of the anime was that friendship bonds are stronger than any dark power that exists and that each hero, no matter how strong he is, cannot overcome evil all by him self. And despite the fact that every episode had at least one scene where they wanted to point that out it didn&#039;t annoy me. It was the way the anime conveyed the message that made it enjoyable and really emotional. Many fight scenes but also these &#039;emotional speeches about friendship and loyalty&#039; gave me enormous chills and I enjoyed every single second of it. <br />
<br />
<br />
3.The story is not centered about one character alone. I think that this is definitely the best thing about Chain Chronicles. Even though we know right from the start who the main characters are, the anime still manages to put every character in the spotlight for some time. And what&#039;s also good, you don&#039;t get an annoying over powered main protagonist with powers served on a silver plate. Through the anime you see the hardship and difficulties that each character is facing and overcoming so in the end you forget that the anime actually started from something you might call a highlight because you get the feeling that you&#039;ve been with the characters from the very beginning.<br />
To conclude the talk about the plot and story line, 24 episodes for this anime might have made it a real masterpiece but nevertheless it is extremely enjoying and entertaining just as it is. And now more about the characters:<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS  👦👩<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Just as I mentioned before, all the characters in Chain Chronicles took part in the story. From the main characters Yuri, Phoena and Aram to some side(main) characters like princess Juliana, Burckhardt and other, each of them had its own side story and they were really good. Most of them were really emotional due to the bonds they shared for each other. The two main male protagonists Yuri and Aram both share a pure and kind personality and willpower. Where they differ? Well, Yuri is a down-to-earth and calm individual that tries to omit conflict at any cost. Aram, being just a boy has a really short temper and gets easily in trouble. <br />
<br />
When it comes to the female lead Phoena, I must say that I didn&#039;t like her in the beginning. I thought she would be just a useless side-kick like Sakura but she actually went through an amazing character development being the keeper of the Chronicle. My favorite character was definitely princess Juliana. She was such a lovely yet though and extremely capable leader that showed strength in moments when she was needed by both her friends and her people. Also one of the most amazing moments was when she fought...SPOILER..in the and. <br />
<br />
ANIMATION AND STYLE 💻<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
I still have no idea what to talk about in this section. As every animation nowadays it is extremely good. Still the thing that not every anime has is detail. The backgrounds of Chain Chronicle are amazing and as mentioned before the fight scenes are incredible. As for the style, I gotta say that I loved the character design. I know it wasn&#039;t that special but it was also not ordinary. And one more thing that is definitely worth mentioning was the opening. The theme song &quot;My Liberation&quot; and the video were really catchy and the proof for that is the fact that I actually did not skip it in every episode. <br />
<br />
CONCLUSION 📌<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
I really don&#039;t understand anime makers form time to time. Were you really that lazy to make additional 12 episodes? It would have made the anime so much better if it actually had a beginning and a proper introduction to the story. Still, awesome characters, a really interesting setting and amazing animation made the anime really enjoyable, entertaining and worth your time. And so I still didn&#039;t find my fantasy masterpiece, but until then I entertain my self it other good anime, and Chain Chronicles is definitely one of them. <br />

    MY LIBERATION<br />

What happens when a mobile game adaptation decides to fling you into the final boss battle and LOSE?<br />
<br />
Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari is an ambitiously &quot;decently&quot; well executed anime adaptation with great world building and characters of a mobile game but...<br />
<br />
Well let&#039;s start off with it&#039;s plot, aforementioned, the main cast of characters, that is the Volunteer Army helmed by Yuri voiced by Akira Ishida tries and failed to defeat the Black King, brushing their wounds and with Pirika the Navi- *ahem* Gacha func- *ahem* the Chronicle embodying the titular Chain Chronicle, disappears. It&#039;s not until Yuri befriends Aram voiced by Daiki Yamashita that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309808">
        Yuri tries once again to reform the Volunteer Army and take on the Black King again.<br />
<br />
Now with the premise itself is an intriguing setting especially the consequences of the main protagonist Yuri and all the burden that weighs on him having failed his people and offset consequences, external and internal it leads him onto. LA will say it off the bat but Yuri is the best, most interesting character out of the entire cast as his entire deal is that is constant need to protect EVERYONE and the burden it brought onto him and when the plot gets very serious, like to the point of no return for Yuri with this entire dilemma it&#039;s all on Yuri where all the intrigue comes in...but<br />
<br />
Ok, elephant in the room and biased opinion coming in. It concerns Aram, the friend Yuri befriends. Aram is an incredibly bratty and annoying character and having a sorta &quot;chosen one&quot; status about him he attracts almost ALL the good luck or is shown to be the &quot;most pure&quot; character out of the entire cast and THAT makes him out to be a gary stu, ohh sure he grows from his annoying bratty ways bu with how the anime just LOVES him got irritating very quick, if anything it feels like what happened in Final Fantasy XII, where Vaan tags along to the plot and the major plotline revolves more towards Ashe than Vaan. LA is NOT saying LA hated Aram or anything but when we have Yuri, a complex main protagonist, filled with backstory and development, heck he might as well be the hero of the anime in all regards and in comparison to Aram who&#039;s the main &quot;protagonist&quot;, thankfully BOTH characters have the majority of the focus in the anime and by the end, well yeah much like Vaan from Final Fantasy XII, Aram got better as he didn&#039;t get top billing during the finale sticking him with the &quot;chosen one&quot; status which was what LA feared.<br />
<br />
As for the other characters, well in comes the world building and where there are fractured factions to the Volunteer Army, mainly Juliana voiced by Kotori Koiwai of the Holy Kingdom and Shuza voiced by Hikaru Midorikawa of the 9 Territories. The allegory in obvious once the both of them clash (aka. west vs. east) and their infighting doesn&#039;t help matters as that affects Yuri&#039;s plotline indirectly as a result due to well you know their major threat of the Black King being a thing. World building isn&#039;t just from Juliana and Shuza as we travel with Yuri and the Volunteer Army that we get to the magic system of this world and functions of the mobile game like &quot;chain attacks&quot; though clunky through it&#039;s animation is still implemented &quot;ok&quot; and though many of the exposition is spouted from the many many MANY minor characters, nonetheless the flavour text was much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Yes, if you haven&#039;t noticed, LA played the English version of the mobile game before it was shut down...<br />
<br />
Now some minor flaws LA wanted to make note of, besides Aram, is that and this is the most obvious one is that the cast is undoubtedly HUGE considering the many factions, villains and allies alike in this anime, now it IS a detriment that we don&#039;t know everyone&#039;s backstory but to this flaw&#039;s defense, Yuri&#039;s and Aram&#039;s along with Juliana, Shuza and Burckhardt&#039;s character developments were decent to the major focus of the entire anime and LA won&#039;t knock those plotliine down if LA doesn&#039;t know EVERY character in the anime and quite honestly that would bloat the entire anime and diverge the plot for no reason. Secondly is the major plot villain himself the Black King himself voiced by Akio Ootsuka, he&#039;s your typical &quot;the world must be destroyed in order to save it&quot; kinda deal, heck his minions are more interesting than he is to be honest. The ONLY interesting thing about the Black King however is that he&#039;s Phoena&#039;s father. Lastly would be the finale and though the finale has ALOT of great points about it, the only flaw that kept nagging LA is that fact &#039;friendship&quot; being the key reason and how the heroes bring themselves back up in defeating the lack King, LA knows it&#039;s cliched to all hell and back but considering the anime constantly and frequently slammed your head with this fact, LA can give this cliche some grace as it was a build up and theme of the anime anyways.<br />
<br />
Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari&#039;s greatest strength comes in making Yuri a believable and fleshed out character with his backstory, development and his latter dilemma&#039;s drowning him into the darkness, yes that&#039;s right the main protagonist and technically the &quot;player&quot; character is the most fleshed out character in the anime, something LA rarely gets to see.<br />
<br />
The animation done by Telecom Animation Film and Graphinica was actually done decently especially from Telecom Animation Film with it&#039;s character designs and backgrounding, though because of the Black King, the atmosphere is mostly on the dreary, &quot;purple-blackness&quot; side of things. CGI was a bit janky though used...&quot;sparingly&quot; and LA says that loosely as they use their CGI in the more complex or quick movements of the characters attacks than anything but it&#039;s blatantly noticeable (though the CGI sometimes are integrated with the traditional animation at times, so it can&#039;t be even consistent) but nonetheless the CGI wasn&#039;t &quot;that&quot; bad. Overall the animation was decent, the CGi a bit iffy at times.<br />
<br />
As for the voice cast, well it was pretty decent all round and though LA did find Daiki Yamashita&#039;s cadence to be annoying as Aram well...actually LA has nothing else to add to that. Ayane Sakura, Akira Ishida and Kotori Koiwai were great as Phoena, Yuri and Juliana respectively if LA would have to note any voice actors that caught LA&#039;s ear and one of the smaller reasons why LA wanted to watch Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari was because of Nao Touyama and she&#039;s a songstress character, ahh so an archetypal role for her and she&#039;s in the supporting cast and sings a bit...yaaaaaaaa. No but seriously the voice cast was nonetheless great, if a bit annoying *cough* Aram<br />
<br />
Like LA aforementioned, the ending is actually pretty great, it wraps up ALL the loose plotlines from every character that had a stake in the plot and thankfully Aram didn&#039;t get top billing and the theme of &quot;friendship&quot; comes in to make that happen (which LA is SOO glad it did). The ending was a climactic finish, slightly cliche sure but nonetheless the culmination of everything that occurred in the anime and was nicely concluded if a bit tongue in cheek in a nice way.<br />
<br />
Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari was an ambitious mobile game adaptation, thinking on it, not many mobile games ever have &quot;ends&quot;, maybe Fate Grand Order in some sense with it&#039;s singularities, but for Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari to think and weave a plot about the downfall of your heroes and the fall and rise it leads into was fascinating, if only the gary stu main protagonist wouldn&#039;t have the spotlight to the actual hero of the anime it would had been a bit better, but nonetheless the finale helped make this statement much better at the end of it all. LA may bias towards Aram, the stereotypical major villain and the huge cast of characters who barely have nay development as well the jank CGI animation but Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari&#039;s main strength lies in it&#039;s characters and world building and that NEVER wavered throughout the anime. Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari was and is ambitious for it&#039;s genre of being a mobile game adaptation and LA by all means feel that it did have a story to tell and went all the way with it and was executed &quot;quite well&quot;.

    Chain Chronicles looked beyond the characters roles and into their hears. An impressive and beautifully animated story.<br />
<br />
When I first looked up this anime I saw some seriously negative reviews and I was almost swayed by them. I am so glad that I didn&#039;t listen. This anime is such a gem. I think the characters and the plot are all quite unique and well thought out. There is also sufficient character development throughout the series for all the main characters. I mean generically you always have a plot where the Hero gathers their team to defeat the Demon king and you don&#039;t often see an anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251935">
        which looks at the consequences of the hero failing. Personally I think this anime was not only well written, but a very decent exploration into the adventure/fantasy genre.<br />
<br />
The animation, now Telecom Animation Film did a splendid job with this. All the characters all looked beautiful, you can tell the budget was big  on this one. Although I&#039;m not very fond of the whole 3D animation theme, they used it sparingly and at beautiful moments. It transformed some of their action scenes into complete masterpieces.<br />
<br />
Which brings us on to the fight scenes. It&#039;s not often that I get so excited by fight scenes that I am practically rocking in my chair. Trust me I love me some fight scenes and If you want to see some serious fighting then I am telling you, you gotta watch this because their swordplay is not only beautiful but intense. All the various characters have their own styles, the Sakuga is great. Trust me it will keep you on your toes.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack was also impressive. It felt like your favourite generic adventure themes with this added hype that got me so hyped for every scene, I tell you the soundtrack made the most menial scenes really awesome.<br />
<br />
Please don&#039;t listen to negative reviews and give it your own chance please, you really don&#039;t know what your missing.  I personally think no matter what your ending opinion of it is, it is definitely worth your time.

    I don&#039;t get it, why did they bring the book and the sprite, the two things the king wanted??<br />
<br />
it&#039;s not a spoiler since it&#039;s literally the first thing that happens. After watching this series I still don&#039;t get it, why did they bring it in the first place? Like, wtf. Sure, let&#039;s go to the evil king and bring the two things he wants, that&#039;s a sound idea of course. What is it with shounen and idiocy?<br />
<br />
In any case it&#039;s the same thing, bad guy, good guy. One reviewer said that it&#039;s hope vs despair, but it&#039;s still pretty shallow in its delivery. Demons want

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278568">
        to destroy the world, sure, how will they eat tho? It&#039;s not sustainable, tsk tsk tsk. Hipsters had it right I guess. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s something you&#039;ve seen before, people with beautiful hair wielding big swords. Bangs will get you killed you know, tie your hair up! Enemies can pull it and stab you since that thing sways, but design over substance, this whole series is a compromise since it&#039;s basically an ad. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
it&#039;s not original and it&#039;s not even good. If you&#039;re not going to be even slightly original then at least be good. Bad king, good guy, some pretty princess wearing the Armor of Eternal unscathed-ness. Good god, royals are serious about cleanliness. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
well it&#039;s well animated. the character design is stupid but it&#039;s from a game so I guess it&#039;s normal. It&#039;s bad, but it&#039;s normal. The archer has a Robin Hood hat with a feather, why? The mage is wearing thick cloak, why? The demons have their tits out, why? I mean the male demons and the king was alright but why do female demons wear bikinis? As I&#039;ve said before, people with long hair wielding big swords, tie your goddamned hair up! Your bangs will kill you! You will be the first person ever to commit friendly fire using a sword. Learn to use a string before you pickup something sharp and heavy.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
it&#039;s there and it&#039;s decent but of course it&#039;s used as a sappy way to make you &quot;feel&quot; during scenes that are pretty much shallow with characters you don&#039;t care about. It&#039;s the same as horror movies using the very low sound frequency that elicits an instinctive response from us to feel bad to make up for a bad movie.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
the rogue feels &quot;rogue-y&quot;, the mage feels &quot;mage-y&quot;, the knight feels &quot;knight-y&quot; it&#039;s a bad anime, nothing much to expect.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I&#039;d much rather watch hentai. Like watch it from beginning to end, I&#039;ve never done that but if I had to watch this again, I&#039;d watch all the hentai in the world first.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
well, I wasted time, nothing to do but prevent others from doing the same. I kinda had hope for this, I don&#039;t even know why.

    An anime with potential that would make a big success if someone cared to explain what the f*...k is happening in this show.<br />
<br />
As long as you watch the first 10 minutes of the first episode you start googling looking for the previous season.At least that&#039;s what I did.<br />
Guess what???!!!! there&#039;s only one season.<br />
<br />
If you haven&#039;t play the game you&#039;re clueless of what is going on in this anime and if you hope to get a descent explaination afterwards through flashbacks you&#039;ll end up empty handed.You figure out some stuff but as long as the anime ends you end up with more questions.<br />
<br />
Why Aram has that

        f***g light?how the black king became the black King?Has phoena any real power??<br />
<br />
Also I didn&#039;t like the fact that the main char is being cast aside half way through.Unless due to little info I misunderstood who is who.<br />
<br />
12 episodes for a story that needs at least 20 before getting to the starting point of this show.<br />
<br />
So summing up<br />
<br />
Good story with great potential if explained properly.<br />
Nice design<br />
Cool Characters<br />
Catchy Op theme<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t watch unless you played the game .<br />
<br />

    Let&#039;s start this off by categories. I&#039;ll keep it nice and clean for a fast review.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story was rushed. It felt as though it was crammed into 12 episodes without a thought of going above that. Overall, I gave it a rating of 5.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound:<br />
Friends raved about the artwork and sound is fairly good. The CG was nice but I felt as though it was overused in some parts of the anime. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Very confusing. To put it short, one character takes over the show while the other character is put on the sideline. On top of that, there were just too many characters crammed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277192">
        into a tiny season. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Durable. It was enough to keep we watching throughout the season to complete the anime. The storyline was poor as well as character.<br />
<br />
All in all:<br />
Do I regret watching this anime? No. It was an anime that I would recommend to a friend. While the story felt rushed and the characters felt a little out of place, the artwork was fairly good. The plot felt as though it was another run of the mill, mc turns bad then he turns good again. With that in heed, I&#039;d suggest you watch it. Nothing to waste your time over. If you were to ask if I would watch it again? I&#039;d say no. Once is enough.

    Recommendation: Skip it if you aren&#039;t a fan of shounen cliches or have zero tolerance for CGI, but otherwise this is one of the better recent video game adaptations you&#039;ll see.<br />
<br />
You can start off by ignoring the show description that&#039;s on this site, it does not describe what happens in the series at all.  It has nothing to do with other worlds or anything of the sort.  Instead, the series opens with Yuri, the main hero and leader of the coalition seeking to stop the Black King from destroying the world, being utterly defeated by said Black King.  Much of the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394594">
        half of the series chronicles Yuri&#039;s attempts to cope with the pressure that he never wanted placed on him, as well as his guilt at failing to stop the end of the world and his attempts to put his coalition back together for one last shot at taking down the Black King in the face of widespread hopelessness and pessimism among his allies.  It has significantly more depth and nuance than you would expect from what appears at first to just be yet another cookie cutter adaptation of a mobile RPG set in a fantasy world.<br />
<br />
The story is the highlight of the series, but there a few interesting characters as well.  Yuri is one of the most interesting heroes you&#039;ll see in a show like this.  You hear him spouting all the stock fantasy hero lines, but are also taken inside his head to understand his self-doubt and the fact that deep down, he very much resents being a hero.  The ogre general Shuza that pursues his own goals and only periodically allies with the hero&#039;s party when their interests align is another interesting one.  Unfortunately, series co-lead Aram is as generic a shounen character as you&#039;ll find.  He&#039;s every bratty kid with &quot;potential&quot; that has to learn to fight as part of a team that you&#039;ve ever seen.  I would have liked to see his character be more nuanced or unique. <br />
 It&#039;s a shame that he ends up carrying much of the series&#039; second half, and it&#039;s far weaker than the first half, which is mostly carried by Yuri, as a result.<br />
<br />
There are a few other more minor criticisms that I would add as well.  For one, the cast is far too big for a 12 episode series.  It&#039;s obvious that many of them were shoehorned in just to get them in the anime and showcase the wide variety of characters you can pull from the game&#039;s gacha mechanics.  It&#039;s one of a relatively few instances where it really makes it blatant that it&#039;s a video game adaptation.  Another is the concept of &quot;chain attacks&quot;, which are an obvious video game mechanic that&#039;s been forced in to highlight the mobile game&#039;s combat system.  Additionally, battle scenes are often animated with CGI, and while it&#039;s better integrated than most CGI you&#039;ll see, it still looks bad or like a low-quality video game cutscene at times.  Characters with long hair suffer the most, as the hair ends up looking like rigid plastic, like you could snap it off like the hair on a lego guy&#039;s head.  It also leans too heavily on generic shounen themes like &quot;trust in your friends&quot; and &quot;never give up&quot;, it would have been nice if had something a bit more unique to say in that regard.<br />
<br />
Overall though, this is one of the best mobile RPG adaptations I&#039;ve seen, and if you can overlook the sometimes generic themes and other minor problems, it&#039;s an interesting little fantasy series where the hero and his party are true underdogs and have to genuinely grapple with the pessimism that comes from being hopelessly outmatched by the villain.  This is definitely a series that has more going on than meets the eye, so don&#039;t judge it by the CGI or the fact that it&#039;s a mobile game adaptation.

    As others have pointed out.  Chain Chronicle is yet another unimaginative adaptation of a gaming title that leans on a series of tropes and clichés to express a simplistic narrative.  There is nothing original or even derivatively interesting here.  It&#039;s only saving grace is that the production values in terms of art and animation make it pretty.  Beyond the tropes, this anime appears to rely heavily on the popularity of its source material (of which, I&#039;m unfamiliar).  It&#039;s fanservice, nothing more.  I have no idea how this could inspire interest in the source material or in subsequent chapters. 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review391281">
        It&#039;s weak, thin, and uninspiring.<br />
<br />
If your looking for a good shonen romp, look to, Black Clover, My Hero Academia, One Piece or the like.  If you&#039;ve already watched what you can of those, don&#039;t bother with Chain Chronicle.  It&#039;s a waste of time.  I whish I could reclaim the 10 episodes worth I squandered on it.

    when i started watching this i was completely lost. halfway into the first episode, i had to double-check to make sure there wasn&#039;t a previous movie or show that i was missing. the anime was really confusing at first, a bunch of information is thrown at you and it&#039;s kind of confusing. <br />
<br />
it doesn&#039;t really get better from there either. sure, it&#039;s a unique story, but it follows the super standard hero stereotypes and it&#039;s just a turnoff from the show. the ending was completely guessable and a bit of a letdown. <br />
<br />
i will say that the fighting scenes are actually pretty decent. they&#039;re in
