    So 13 weeks in and now at the end of Gou no Sara, I never got to a point where I felt this season was as bad as people had hyped it up to be. I waited week after week for it to get awful and it just never came for me. I thoroughly enjoyed every single moment of this final season and saw it as a victory lap of sorts for the series. We saw everyone come full circle this season and show off their development. Of particular importance for me was the growth that Megumi, Erina and Aldini have had. For me, that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357446">
        was enough to really enjoy the final season. I understand that this is an unpopular opinion and that&#039;s fine, you can judge for yourself, but if you&#039;re a fan of SnS, you should definitely give this last season a try.<br />
<br />
Production wise, you can definitely tell JC staff started to rely on the established name of SnS instead of actually putting a lot of effort into the show. The panning camera shots, off model characters and other quality control issues are not a huge deal to me, because I personally watch things for the story and how they make me feel rather than as an art critic, but they do exist and are noticeable. I also could feel that pacing was very rushed especially in the final half of the season. It felt like the Shokgeki&#039;s were on 2.5x speed and the detail and educational bits that we&#039;re accustomed to seeing were just not there anymore. It felt like they instead transitioned to relying on the girls getting naked as our sole source of entertainment during shokugeki&#039;s. I was able to overlook this because I&#039;m easy to please, you may not be.<br />
<br />
Overall, you can definitely see a dip in quality from SnS season 1 to season 5. It&#039;s gradual, it&#039;s painful and it&#039;s pretty sad because of how well done season 1-3 were. But, it is it the sad reality of ongoing shows. You either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become Food Wars Season 5. The anime original ending wasn&#039;t bad to me, but it wasn&#039;t great like how I felt at the end of Totsuki Train either. I was still left wanting more. Despite all the flaws, I still love the series and enjoyed this a lot even with its issues. Shokugeki no Soma Gou no Sara gets 7 foodgasms out of 10 from me.<br />

    After 4 relatively strong seasons Shokugeki is back with its final arc, many fans expected the previous season to be a good place to finish the series, between the manga ending and the overall satisfactory place the anime ended it seemed to be a great place to end the show. The fans were 100% right, this season blows and there isn’t a better or easier way to describe it, Shokugeki no Soma was never a series known for being particularly good, its essentially food porn the anime, with exaggerated over the top reactions and some great comedy. However, even with knowledge of the manga having

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357425">
        a questionable turn in the story, it was hard to see this absolute disaster coming<br />
<br />
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Story: 1<br />
<br />
This is the first time I have ever given a 1 to a story, this season of food wars throws out literally everything the series built up and cherished. Soma and his dad’s rivalry being built up? Doesn’t matter since Soma’s father loses off screen to some edge lord teenage version of Nakiri’s dad, who happens to have the cooking equivalent of Sharingan. The competitions being legitimate measures of a student being able to run a restaurant? It’s all about game show theater now with chefs bringing in actual chainsaws, motorcycles and goddam explosives into the kitchen. <br />
<br />
Noir as the antagonists pretty much made the entire season unbearable, the moment the black KKK robe wearing gang showed up I genuinely lost any ability to continue taking this show seriously, it was simply too comical, I don’t know how the mangaka actually thought that look was supposed to be cool or intimidating. I don’t care about them, I cant even try to understand their motivations, and the entire concept of criminal cooks seems like poorly written fanfiction. Elite chefs who work for Mafia and such, don’t cook with chainsaws, they cook the way a regular chef would using regular kitchen tools. The author who used to at least try to get his series grounded in reality threw out everything and completely destroyed any suspension of disbelief.<br />
<br />
Art: 3<br />
<br />
The art style is very basic, in fact it might be the peak JC staff Power Point, even the opening consists of cut out characters, colored manga panels, and recycled movement. Its actually jarring to compare the art in this season to that of the first season, the difference in animation, the gorgeous backgrounds and mental imagery, and the overall change for the worse in even the foodgasms. Absolutely every aspect of the art in this series has faced a decline, there are no redeeming factors, and if not for the fact that I have seen even worse declines this year like Deen taking over the third season of a certain shonen series, I would have given the art a 1 as well.<br />
<br />
The sound: 5<br />
<br />
Its passable, I would write more but realistically there isn’t much to write here. The sound is extremely forgettable, generic sound effects, generic dramatic background music, reuse of the old soundtrack many times, forgettable OP. Overall its just passable sound, its not bad enough to be remembered, and not good enough to be noteworthy.<br />
<br />
Characters: 4<br />
<br />
Jobbing is a common trope in any battle themed form of entertainment, be it pro wrestling or shonen manga, it occurs to hype up new threats. However there is a good way to job and a poor way to do it, having all the fan favorite characters completely annihilated by Noir with no redemption or come back arc is among the worst ways to go about it. Remember what an amazing chef Yukihira’s dad was? Well he gets beaten off screen even before Asahi managed to get more cooking skills with his food copy ability. Remember the previous seasons top rival chef Tsusaka? He gets unceremoniously beaten without even managing to beat a single noir chef. Tadakoro got some respect but was reduced to her usually damsel role after Asahi tears her apart with ease. Overall the complete ruination and downplay of all the characters built up through the series in the final competition by complete outsiders, have utterly destroyed any enjoyment of the characters I had. It also doesn’t help that the majority of the coolest characters, did not even show up for the competition but just as spectators, and that Erina had all her character progress thrown out the window. Overall, the fans of this series will be very disappointed by the jobbing, the out of character behavior, and the overall cutting out of fan favorite characters in this final season.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4<br />
I did not enjoy this season, I don’t see fans of the series enjoying this season either. It feels like the prior season is where the series should have ended, and that this season was an unwanted arc written by a mangaka who genuinely wanted to torpedo their own story to end it.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4<br />
<br />
This wasn’t a particularly good show, in fact it was probably among the worst things I have seen this year, a 4 is the lowest score I give to anime. I only give a 4 to animes that I absolutely despise and think are hot trash, the only reason this even gets a generous 4 is because it had some decent cooking reaction scenes and because the show was watchable to the end.<br />

    Everyone who knows me knows that I am a massive Food Wars Fan, to the point that I do consider myself a Food Wars connoisseur in some respects (as stupid as that sounds). With that in mind, I am having an extremely difficult time getting behind this adaptation and am finding myself really forcing myself to watch each new episode. As a fan, this hurts and is quite disheartening, but unfortunately I knew this was coming. <br />
<br />
To start, lets address the little elephant in the room, BLUE arc absolutely sucked in comparison to the rest of the fantastic (imho) manga. Everyone is aware of this.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349742">
        With the knowledge that BLUE arc is widely considered as terrible it was going to be an uphill battle for J.C. Staff to adapt it. But who knows, there is always the potential that J.C. Staff could actually make it somewhat entertaining and stomachable (is that even a word….?), making it into a worthwhile anime to consume in the later episodes, and I would gladly change my review in the future if that is the case. Unfortunately, with a saddened heart, that appears to be not the case as of now. <br />
<br />
Of course, with Covid-19 greatly affecting the lives of everyone globally, some leeway can be easily given to those in the anime industry as it makes their jobs just that much more difficult (not even going to begin to pretend that I know the exact ways they’re affected so I’ll leave it at that). There is no doubt that the quality of the anime is going to be affected in a negative manner, and this review takes that into account. <br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
<br />
As stated earlier, BLUE arc is by far the worst arc in this wonderful series. With that in mind, it would be very difficult to turn it into a good story unless J.C. turned it into an anime original season or conclude with an anime original ending (which I still deeply hope happens). <br />
<br />
The entire arc gives hardly any sense of danger to Soma, nor really builds upon any previous character relationships to make a memorable finale, which is a huge disappointment. For anime only fans, I’ll stop there and let you form your own opinions, as the experience may be completely different from your point of view, and hope you aren’t as soured as myself and other fans. However, my biggest gripe is that the main “villain” Asahi Saiba also is just thrown into the story as the next villain that Soma must defeat in order to fully understand what it means to master his cooking through finding someone who he wants to cook for. As of now in the anime, Asahi is nothing but a shallow character who lacks any form of depth, and J.C. Staff has done nothing to change that in the adaptation. He gets an extremely rushed introduction with no real motive but to take Erina as his bride. Another major turn off is that majority of the side characters who lots of us have grown to love over the last four seasons have been neutered to become even less important in the story (minus Erina, Megumin, and Takumi of course). I’ve got nothing against those three, on the contrary they’re my favorite three characters other than Soma, but the entire cast of characters were important in helping this show become what it is. <br />
<br />
The cooking battles are still entertaining in their own right, but the story itself is just so rushed and lackluster in terms of why the BLUE tournament is now of this format instead of the traditional tournament and the motives behind Asahi Saiba that it is much more difficult to get behind and enjoy the story. I will say that the whole idea of underground chef&#039;s is cool in theory, but in practice here, it is really not doing it for me as it is not done very well nor are they really fleshed out as a whole. Instead, they are almost portrayed as a cult of chefs who blindly follow their leader, Asahi. <br />
<br />
I won’t even begin on the drastic change in tone from moving from spending more time on the epicness (again not a word lol) related to the actual cooking of the dishes to spending most of the screen time illustrating the foodgasms. I mean, who doesn’t like a good foodgasm from time to time, as that’s a reason why we are degenerate enough to watch and enjoy this show, but a lot of the allure was in the actual cooking of the dishes (or I can just be the only one who thinks this, that’s cool too). Simply, I just don’t like this shift in style, as it takes the show in the wrong direction. <br />
<br />
Art/Animation: 7/10<br />
<br />
I will be honest right of the bat, getting a partial bias out of the way. As of the last few years, I think that J.C. Staff has begun to rank as one of the worst companies in the industry in terms of animation quality (you can rake my feet over coal or agree if you would like). This unfortunately is quite evident in the last two seasons of Food Wars as they were glorified power point presentations with a moving background and music (damn awesome music I might add). However, even with the global dumpster fire hampering the ability of these fantastic professionals to bring us our anime fix, the animation quality this season is definitely better than the two previous seasons. I was presently surprised to see the quality increase and am quite pleased. The art also looks sharp and crisp, nothing special, but is more than passable. <br />
<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
<br />
As really stated in the story portion of this review, Asahi Saiba is honestly just a one-toned “villain” who lacks any depth, and feels nothing short of a forced villain for the sake of providing a villain. Other than that, the character dynamics are essentially the same as the previous seasons, except for Erina, who finally is becoming more accepting and open to those around her, including Soma. This is nice to see happen, but unfortunately it is really the only sort of character development we&#039;ve seen.  <br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
The opening is cute, and catchy, but nowhere near as good as previous seasons. Again, however, is that in the sound department nothing has really changed from previous seasons. Lots of the same soundtracks are used, which are mainly pretty damn epic, and the voice acting is quite well done as well. Nothing really to say here so I’ll leave it at that as it is the same old Food Wars awesomeness. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
<br />
Even though I have just spent a stupid amount of words regrettably bashing one of my favorite animes of all time, I still somewhat enjoy the episodes when I do finally bring myself to watch them as it is always nice to see a favorite manga adapted into an anime.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10 <br />

As a fan who was soured because of this arc, I cannot give this season a high recommendation, but still give it slight seal of approval. However, with this is mind, if you have stuck with the anime all this time (as obviously everyone reading this review has) it is still worth a watch, and don’t let my idiotic ramblings deter you from watching this, especially if you are enjoying the season yourself. <br />
<br />
To end: Let’s all stay safe, and enjoy the foodgasms while we can :)<br />

    Meet Souma, he is the son of the owner of a small eatery in Japan. For his age, Souma is a very talented person able to easily come up with new dishes; sometimes these dishes are some really weird combinations of the ingredients no one would use. After some time, the owner of the Souma&#039;s eatery, Souma&#039;s father, leaves the family business to work with his friend. Souma&#039;s restaurant is on the verge of closing. To improve his cooking skills and to save the restaurant, Souma begins studying in Engetsu Teahouse Culinary Academy, which is regarded as Japan&#039;s top culinary academy. The problem is that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357421">
        only a few are able to graduate from it, these few are world&#039;s best gourmet of culinary. Will Souma manage to graduate from the academy?<br />
<br />
Many have been waiting to see the 5th season and the pandemic made this wait even more impossible to put up with. However, was it worth it? I do not know. It does not feel like Food Wars anymore. Just a season ago, Souma was not the member of the Elite Ten; things were different. The new season could have focused more on the life of the new members of the council; however, the only thing it does is jumping from one event to another, without giving the viewer enough time to enjoy the series, which makes this season somewhat rushed, to say the least.<br />
<br />
What I mean is that the anime introduces a group of supposedly French underworld chefs called Noir, which is French for ‘black.’ They immediately become the main ‘villains’ of the 5th season. Do not get me wrong, I have nothing against Noir. The problem, however, is their leader, who is so far one of the worst characters of Food Wars, because it is simply beyond obvious who he is, what he tries to achieve and why. Anyways, I am sorry for destroying your hopes for seeing Yukihira Souma’s father as the last boss. He is no longer shown as one of the best, something that 4 seasons of Food Wars have been doing. Yukihira Jouichirou is not the only problem for me to mention, he, just like many of the supporting characters are quickly forgotten; the new season does not care about giving  all the characters, including the supporting characters enough love and this is very easy to notice.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, the new season suddenly changes many characters, without explaining anything for the viewer to understand these sudden changes that appear ‘out of nowhere.’ Take for example Erina Nakiri. She suffers the same fate as the father of Souma, she is not that amazing genius that could make a masterpiece out of nothing and a chef from a simple amateur anymore. Funny thing is that Erina is not the only example of this ‘sudden character change’ and there are other reasons for me to say that, but they will be for you to find out.<br />
<br />
And there you have it, Food Wars! The Fifth Plate. The season, where everything is simply beyond obvious and it makes this season boring, somewhat lazy, careless and inattentive to the important details. Tsukasa Eishi is an excellent example of how characters should look like, it is visible the moment you see him that Tsukuda Yuuto did everything to make him look like a chef. His passion for cooking is very understandable, because all he can do in life is cooking. Now compare him to Saiba Asahi. It just feels as if Tsukasa Eishi’s character was written within a week and Saiba Asahi within a day.<br />
<br />
On this positive note, it does not mean that you will not appreciate the 5th season. If you are a fan, do not listen to what other people have to say, including my review, of course. I am a fan of Food Wars, I loved and still love the first seasons, however, I failed to enjoy the 5th season, because of the fact that it is way too obvious from the very beginning: you know what it is going to be about, you know everything about the main villain of the season the moment you see him and this makes it boring; there is no mystery.<br />
<br />
With that being said,<br />
S1: 10/10;<br />
S2: 9/10;<br />
S3: 8/10;<br />
S4: 8/10;<br />
S5: 5/10.

    After watching it until last episode, I know how disappointing this is, really.<br />
<br />
The story begins with the introduction of the arrival of summer, the students of Totsuki Academy must fight the first stage of the exam. After that, some teacher comes to Totsuki Academy, his name is Asahi. He&#039;s a ugly bastard who are interested with Nakiri&#039;s oppai.... And then the last tournament &quot;BLUE&quot; begins.<br />
<br />
The story of Souma&#039;s mom<br />
Now, what really caught the attention of the personal writer was the telling of the figure of Souma&#039;s mom. This is very interesting because in the previous seasons, the figure of Souma&#039;s mom has never even been

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357424">
        shown or even told, her figure seemed to have never even been thought of. So Souma&#039;s mom appearance in season 5 is very, very surprising.<br />
<br />
There are times when we feel hurt. There are times when we want to run from reality. There are times when we don&#039;t want to do anything. We can rest, we can stop but we cannot give up. If you can&#039;t get up, ask someone else for help. If we are already destroyed by our own mistakes, then wait for the right time to get back up. If you can&#039;t invite other people, walk side by side with them.<br />
<br />
This is the last season, I hope you can watch this final series and don&#039;t stop at the middle of the season. I know it is torturing you but an ending is not always tragic. If you already read manga, I beg you to don&#039;t miss this one, I know you are bored but to judge an anime before you watch it, isn&#039;t that weird?

    NO SPOLERS: Shokugeki no Soma has become an incredibly mediocre series. This season in particular was so bad that I just couldn&#039;t continue watching it. The plot of the season seems meaningless and watching the characters interact is a pain as there are no characters that I genuinely like anymore. As someone who originally liked the series, it has become painful to see what has happened to it. They&#039;re basically reusing plotpoints and things like them not doing anything on the first day of the test but impressing everyone on the last day which I honestly don&#039;t find entertaining anymore. Not only that, I can&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review351649">
        express how much I hate the antagonists of this season that they introduced out of nowhere and are supposed to be badass but are not. Overall. I have heard that the author of the series was pushed to his limits by shonen jump, making him not able to finish the series in a good way which is quite sad as it had potential. Hearing that, makes me unable to blame the author so, Shonen Jump ruined the series in my opinion.

    Overall: 5/10<br />
I try my best not to compare anime adaptations to their source material. However, the BLUE arc from the manga failed so miserably, there is no other way for me to go about this review without looking at how the anime is trying not to end up in flames.<br />
<br />
POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD<br />
<br />
So far, the final season is actually coming along not bad. Story and character suffer mostly because of the source material; it&#039;d be asking too much for the anime to completely rewrite Asahi Saiba. However, the anime has already taken steps (and likely will in the future) to rectify the horrible writing.<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
tbh, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350991">
        premise of the BLUE arc is actually not that bad. Being able to see Soma finally surpass his dad or succeed at BLUE would&#039;ve been nice. However, I think it would&#039;ve seen more success if either:<br />
a) the 4th season didn&#039;t have such a &quot;finale like ending&quot; (originally, the author intended to end the manga here as well)<br />
b) more time was spent to build up into BLUE (pacing feels very off for something of this scale)<br />
c) BLUE is done as an epilogue type arc (OVA or whatever, doesn&#039;t matter)<br />
<br />
The main issue with this arc is the pacing. It feels like everything is coming out of nowhere and doesn&#039;t make sense. BLUE felt like it was just announced on the spur, when you&#039;d expect the entire cooking world to receive some precursor to the event being held again. Noir is an interesting concept, but was never hinted at or introduced early on; how can such a large organization, including Asahi, go unnoticed? Gin, Joichiro, and others are clearly aware of Noir&#039;s existence.<br />
<br />
However, I must applaud the anime for removing the Asahi/Erina kidnapping arc.  Instead, we only see Asahi attacking Totsuki&#039;s pride which riles up Erina. This is a wayyyy better approach thanks to all the character development Erina has gotten (this was thrown away in the manga pretty much) by making it about the friend&#039;s she&#039;s made and not herself. I also like the small adjustments the studio is making to the romantic plot of SomaxErina (balcony scene). If small changes like this keep getting made (and we get an anime original ending which I pray to god for), I&#039;d be willing to up this score to a 6 even. For now though, it&#039;s a 4 for being quite literally &quot;decent&quot;.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
Art is great, nothing new but nothing horribly done either.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
Not a fan of the OP, but voice acting and mixing is pretty good still. We still get those high quality orgasmic moans so everything is up to standard.<br />
<br />
Character: 2/10<br />
Another flaw coming from the manga, sadly. Asahi Saiba is such a horribly written character, there&#039;s no way to go around it. His motivations are cheap (basically designed to mirror Soma in a way). His victory over Joichiro is literally only so Soma can beat his dad through proxy. A &quot;plot sword&quot; so to speak. Soma doesn&#039;t need to beat his dad for the series to end; we&#039;ve clearly seen his character change from the start of the series (me beat daddy) to having more grand goals like being the top of his generation, beating Erina, etc. Asahi Saiba is just a really cheap end-all-be-all boss for Soma. The Noir chefs are really cheap characters too. As fodder, you shouldn&#039;t expect any characterization. <br />
<br />
Again, the anime cutting some dialogue and plot threads short hurts character development a bit, like Joichiro and Soma discussing the future of Yukihira and Soma&#039;s goals (this was at least done well in the manga). However, despite the anime&#039;s choice to have a BLUE preliminary competition to showcase all the characters, I felt that they could have elaborated a bit more on the improvements made by Megumi and Takumi to their cooking; aside from their status as MCs alongside Soma, their rankings within the Elite 10 make their feat of entering BLUE a bit weird to accept at first.<br />
<br />
The biggest character development to watch out for as the season wraps up is Erina; hopefully, they don&#039;t gut her character for no reason like they did in the manga.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
Shokugeki no Soma ended almost a year ago in the shittiest way possible. Almost as bad as Bleach. Yet, this season gives me a sliver of hope of having a good ending hence the 5/10. Yes, Asahi Saiba is still a poorly written character. Yes, the pacing is still quite rushed at times. But for what they had to work with, the anime has made some reasonable adjustments to steer this series towards an acceptable end.<br />
<br />
Fingers crossed that character development is decent in the future, since that alongside good writing (and food porn/orgasms) was what made this series special. Watching half of Shokugeki&#039;s strong points get gutted and rushed to hell for the final arc ruined everything the last 8 years worked so hard to create.

    It&#039;s good old Shokugeki but the video speed is set at 1,5x !<br />
<br />
First, let&#039;s adress the biggest issue that this anime has. In previous seasons, it wasn&#039;t like this, so I really don&#039;t know what happened. But, for some reason, this anime is FAST. In the manga, this season&#039;s plot was incredibly rushed, and it got criticised for it a lot. However, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the case here. They&#039;re adding a lot of stuff, fleshing out certain parts so they have more depth and changing quite a lot of things. It&#039;s not the plot that rushed, quite the opposite. But, somehow, watching it feels

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349821">
        a little stressful. Important moments last literally 1 second, everyone is speaking so fast, the battle music is playing the whole episode, etc. You can literally get exhausted watching it. If they didn&#039;t add so many changes and details I would think they&#039;re just making the anime without realising what is important, what should they emphasize and all the other important things. <br />
<br />
But, I still enjoy it a lot. It&#039;s simple, I like the characters, and the story is entertaining. We have the old characters + Asahi. Fukuyama Jun makes Asahi great,and I&#039;m loving his anime version honestly. There aren&#039;t many other new characters so most most of the time it resembles the previous seasons. <br />
<br />
And honestly, if you&#039;re watching this you&#039;ve probably already saw over 70+ of Shokugeki no Soma episodes. If you liked those seasons, it means:<br />
<br />
- You liked the characters<br />
- You couldn&#039;t care less about animation (yes, it probably doesn&#039;t get any worse than this)<br />
- You like Soma crushing his opponents in cooking battles with cool music in the background<br />
<br />
Then I don&#039;t see why you would not like this season. I enjoyed the story in the manga but this version is a bit different and so far, so even if you didn&#039;t like that I still suggest giving it a try. <br />
<br />
Also, both the opening and the ending are insanely good (this is unironically a very important point, actually).<br />
<br />
If you get used to the fast pace I&#039;m going to recommend this. The 8 score is a bit weaker 8, but if you&#039;re a Shokugeki fan, you&#039;re going to enjoy this final season too.<br />
<br />

    I don&#039;t understand what the fuss is about? Shokugeki so soma has been very consistent with its story and animation. Had the anime ended with the 4th season, it wouldn&#039;t have been a fulfilling climax. I still get goosebumps while watching the show. The previous seasons have put in a lot of effort to make us fall in love with the characters and I will be brutal honest over here, I sometimes get so nostalgic and my eyes become watery with the emotions involved, and that never happens to me with any other anime.<br />
In the end, I would just like to say that food wars\shokugeki

    I&#039;ve never felt such a strong sadness after finishing a series. I&#039;ve been sad at ending like Gurren Lagann and Banana Fish but this hits different. I feel dismayed. After 5 seasons of food battles, foodgasms, and ridiculous characters, Food Wars felt empty at the end for multiple reasons. This season felt like it got rid of any goodwill the show had left for me after season 4 and it tried its hardest. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with Asahi because holy shit, this dude was an awful villian. Say what you will about Azami but he at least looked villainous and had the backstory of a villain

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357450">
        but Asahi? Fuck this dude. His whole power is insane and one of the dumbest things I&#039;ve seen in an anime and his overall reasoning of wanting to marry Erina is at first, just corny and then they just throw another twist at the end that just makes his plot seem disgusting in hindsight. He was a bad villian, his reason for being a villian is dumb and he was just the worst.<br />
<br />
Then we have the worst sin for me and that&#039;s the usage of side characters. Listen, I like Soma, Erina, Megumi, and Aldini but that&#039;s not the whole fucking cast guys. Seriously, most of the other characters in this show barely showed up at all. It&#039;s so frustrating to watch the same characters (no matter how likable they are) when you know that there&#039;s more fun characters being wasted, Seriously, aren&#039;t Ryo and Akira supposed to be rivals to Souma and they didn&#039;t do shit for most of the season. Fuck, I forgot they existed. It&#039;s ridiculous and their replacements are garbage. <br />
<br />
The underworld chef idea was pretty weird to have in a show about teenage cooks trying to be the best chefs ever but it doesn&#039;t help when the show decided to add fucking supervillains like a Sargent who uses explosives to heat their food up, a clown that uses fucking juggling to cook and that&#039;s not to say their designs are stupid because they are. <br />
<br />
Finally, there&#039;s the animation. By this point, I&#039;m beating a very dead horse but it still stands to reason that the animation in this was sub-par at best. They fucking reused multiple moments from other seasons in the episode so blatantly it was. amazingly shitty. I also realized just how little JC Staff really gave a shit about this season in the final episode when there was no big animation moment that supposed to look and it was just the same sub-par shitty quality. Nice JC.<br />
<br />
In the end, I&#039;m not angry, I&#039;m just disappointed. After how fantastic the first two seasons were, I was still excited for what the show had going for it. Then the third season happened and while it wasn&#039;t great, I still had hope. Even after Season 4, I was hoping that at the very least, it would go out on a high note. Nope. Not even that. It&#039;s frustrating, disappointed and just makes me sad. At the very least, I will hold those last two seasons in high regard. Thank you for that at least, JC Staff. Fuck this season though.

    In my opinion, this is almost as bad as a concluding anime season can be.<br />
<br />
It was honestly bad enough for me to look back at all the previous season and wonder if they were actually as good as I remembered them to be. This is because this anime performs all of Shokugeki’s conventions so poorly that it almost comes across as a critique of the series. Let me break down how this season manages to critique by nothing other than poor execution. <br />
<br />
Let’s start with what Shokugeki is known for first, pornography. <br />
<br />
Whoops, sorry, I mean “Ecchi”. To be more specific, Shokugeki is most known

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357714">
        for its fanserivice during food reactions. I actually believe that this series (up to this season) is the best use of fanservice because it is used as a creative way to express how good the food is. <br />
<br />
I say “up to this season” because the fanservice in this season is lazy and visually unappealing. The ecchi reactions are typically a single pose of creatively uninteresting artwork. This applies to the entire season, as the animation relies heavily on still frames and the art is undetailed and uninspired.<br />
<br />
But the fanservice is even worse than that. Towards the end, it achieves something that I’ve never seen before and becomes “Fanservice Fanservice”. “Fanservice Fanservice” is when a show that typically uses fanservice for a creative narrative effect shows fanservice just because the audience expects fanservice.<br />
<br />
This occurs toward the end when literally every somewhat relevant character in the series shows up to a competition just for the purpose of fanservice. At that point, it quite literally BECOMES a parody of itself.<br />
<br />
Next, I will discuss he second thing Shokugeki is known for, the actual cooking.<br />
<br />
As I stated previously, the animation and art are both very lazy and uninspired. The cooking scenes are usually just a static pose of a character with some camera movement and a blurry background. They hardly show the actual cooking too. The cooking is over in about 10 seconds and they just describe how they cooked the dish while the judges eat it. It’s so lazy that I feel loke nobody who worked on this anime actually cared.<br />
<br />
But similar to the ecchi, these cooking scenes also manage to critique the series in general by making it abundantly clear how the cooking battles work. One chef finishes with a good dish. The second chef finishes with a good dish and makes one for the first chef. The first chef is blown away and the second chef wins. I think this was how every single battle went in this season and it ruins my perception on previous seasons as well.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I could go on and on about things I disliked about this season. I could write a whole 8 paragraphs about how awful the villain group “Noir” is and how they are a bunch of clowns larping as ninjas. I could write a whole essay about how the characters are so poorly written and how heir actions make no sense. I could dedicate my entire anime watching career analyzing how this season was unnecessary and actually left side characters at worse places than in the previous season. But I don’t have the willpower to do any of these things.<br />
<br />
I’m not strong enough. This anime has drained me.<br />
<br />
I suppose I should explain why I rated this anime a 2 instead of a 1. The reason for that is soley because the last three episodes were somewhat competent. The art and animation in episodes 11 and 12 were somewhat decent and had some nice tie-ins to Souma’s past. The final episode had decent breakthrough with Souma and Erina (although I still felt their love was too forced at the end). <br />
<br />
I also liked the Souma and Takami team up and that Souma’s dad kept a stubble beard after Souma saved him from his bearded depression when his wife died.<br />
<br />
That is literally all that I liked about this season, but it was just enough to push it to a 2. Yes, I really believe it is this bad. I know the source material was bad, but that does not excuse the lack of effort put in place by the studio. I’m just sad that a well-known and somehwhat respected anime like this was given such a bad ending.<br />
<br />
It is closer to a 1 than a 3.

    NO SPOILER REVIEW<br />

Wow. This has to be one of the biggest betrayals. Shokugeki was doing so well until this season through the whole story into the sewer and then pooped on it more.<br />
<br />
The pacing in this season is horrendous, everything is rushed and you barely see any of the meals being cooked. All you get are rushed reactions, rushed plots, and every previously made notion of characters destroyed. <br />
<br />
Animation, horrible. Merely a bunch of flashbacks or panning shots. <br />
<br />
Soundtrack, not bad, it&#039;s sad that the OP was wasted on this trash season<br />
<br />
Characters, the season throws away all but 4 main characters, taking away any development

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357572">
        that had previously existed.<br />
<br />
<br />
DO NOT WATCH if you haven&#039;t yet. It is a complete waste of time, COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME, and you&#039;re better ending the show with the end of Season 4.

    Food Wars Season Five feels like whoever wrote the first three seasons got swapped out for a complete amateur. It&#039;s main issues, the writing and characterisation, drown out all of its potential and highlight other problems.<br />
<br />
Saiba Asahi - the main antagonist of the season - is often maligned for being a poorly written character who is badly developed, unlikable, extremely creepy, and inconsistent. All of this is true. Despite all that Asahi&#039;s main issue is that he&#039;s a clear example of Food Wars at its worst. His cooking skill is basically magical so you can&#039;t get invested in it, he only defeats previously established characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354306">
        to build up his own legend rather than actually going about and actually doing things that are impressive, and his actual writing is just typical shonen villain. It&#039;s just awful every time he&#039;s on screen and all of his shokugekis are just obnoxious to watch - though that&#039;s become the norm.<br />
<br />
Shokugekis also changed over time from chefs preparing things you could arguably make in your own kitchen to characters creating pretty looking food esque things out of absolutely nowhere. Because of this shokugekis are now absurdly quick to go through and theres no real ebb and flow to it. Just challenge, someone uses a dumb technique, then to the judges. This makes them rather boring to watch as you have no investment in them beyond their relevance to the plot. I miss back when we had reasonable things like eggs over rice and pork wrapped in bacon not &quot;food looking thing asahi made that was never named.&quot;<br />
<br />
Music isn&#039;t memorable. The op is worth skipping. The animation looks fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless you really like this anime and want to see then end: just save yourself the time.

    Itadakimas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The 5th Plate has ended and so as the series itself , so Bon appétit as I make my review of this last sequel of Shokugeki no Souma.....:<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Pros: Given that this has reached it&#039;s climax. Despite of the rushed plot, it was still good, given that it finally reached its end and the story itself present a goodbye when thing ends in a very good note, in which I wish not to spoil , so just watch and enjoy the foodgasam that is the very quintessential part of this series&#039; plot.<br />
<br />
Cons: The problem was that this final sequel has to rely a lot on the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357518">
         quintessential disrobing part of the foodgasam, where we audience are subject to it as its teaser to dampen its story&#039;s mediocre plot.....<br />
<br />
Verdict (6 over 10)<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Pros: Much more darling than the 1st 3 sequel , cu&#039;z here everyone gets naked one way or the other as the foodgasam gets intense.<br />
<br />
Cons: They still don&#039;t do, up skirting or panchira scene to them girls, oh, and no nipples service around. <br />
<br />
Verdict (7 over 10)<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Pros: ___________________________________<br />
<br />
Cons:___________________________________<br />
<br />
Verdict (5 over 10)<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
Pros: The introduction of the ff: Saiba Asahi and his Nior lackeys&#039; and Erina&#039;s mom cu&#039;z they present as new challenges for the main character Yukihira Souma and Erina Nakiri......<br />
<br />
Cons: The misused of the other support characters from Totsuki Academy like  Kurokiba, Ryou,  Hayama, Akira, Kabutoyama, Tetsuji and other past antagonists from previous sequels , in which IMAO was an injustice.<br />
<br />
Verdict (7 over 10)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Pros: Those dishes still get to me and so as the more intense ecchi thing.<br />
<br />
Cons: I&#039;m gonna miss this.<br />
<br />
Verdict ( 7 over 10)<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Verdict (9 over 10)<br />
<br />
It may be rushed, but when it has an ending this clean, who cares? So Bon Appétit..........................<br />
<br />

    As I write this review, Food Wars s5 is airing (on episode 6) and I&#039;m having a great time watching it despite how trashy I know it is.<br />
<br />
While the villains make no sense and the world is confusing, to an extent these things make up some of the show&#039;s charm. It feel like if Jojo&#039;s was a food battle shounen.<br />
<br />
Let me give an example to explain my weird point of view: chefs all use knives and other interesting implements to imbue their dishes with personality, right? Well, at the end of episode 5, a member of the villains appears with a CHAINSAW and SLEDGEHAMMER, wearing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review352343">
        military uniform.<br />
If someone has a reasonable explanation, I&#039;d like to hear it.<br />
<br />
As a battle shounen, i don&#039;t think season 5 is objectively as good as the previous seasons, however, I found it much more fun to watch due to the absurdity of the show being cranked up to 11.<br />

    Shokugeki no Souma: Gou no Sara is the fifth and final season of Shokugeki no souma, a quite well-known show among the anime community. As you can see already it has its fifth season whereas many shows can&#039;t even get their second, this makes it clear that Shokugeki no souma is one of the popular shows which has seen great success with its previous seasons. Then what about its fifth plate?<br />
<br />
Being a fan of the show myself I expected the show to end on a good note but this season was a bit disappointing. The first problem was with the pacing. It was rushed as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358413">
        much as possible to adapt the remaining chapters and this made the experience half-assed and incomplete. Comparing to its previous seasons this season&#039;s story itself was a problem. The story was not as engaging as it&#039;s supposed to be and had a lot of unnecessary additions which made the show go into a different path from being a cooking show. Its previous seasons relied on the characters, their cooking skills, information, and knowledge about ingredients, dishes, and cooking techniques rather than introducing unrealistic and superficial types of cooking techniques that pulled the show into a never-ending abyss. This show completely changed its course from being a cooking that had competitions and a sense of rivalry that made the show interesting. The characters got lost and had no roles to perform and obviously the term called &quot;character development&quot; does not exist here. The Shokugeki no souma I liked dealt with stakes very well and gave a sense of tension whereas this season&#039;s stakes are very silly tbh.<br />
<br />
The animation and art style was average at best and never showed us the best side of cooking that I wanted to see. The soundtracks were not used to its full potential. This season did not feel like the Shogeki no souma that I liked. <br />
Even with all these flaws, I cannot forget the previous seasons that brought me to this final last season of Shogeki no souma. I enjoyed the journey and it was such a good ride anyway.<br />
<br />
Like everything that starts always ends, this show ends with an average season and yet makes me feel nostalgic about the time I started watching it, and that brings a great feel of closure(for me at least). Thank you for reading. <br />
<br />
Glad You Liked it!<br />

    The Fifth Season suffers from power creep, because the author intended to end the manga at its natural conclusion at the end of Season 4, which would have answered the question of mutual respect between Erina and Souma. The audience could infer a relationship. But the studio and whatever powers that be wanted an ending about the hierarchical abilities between the two, hence a totally unexpected season 5 written post hoc.<br />
<br />
The abilities at the end of season 4 were already ever-powerful, that in order to maintain the tension in this season, the author ran out of ideas and had to tap into the ridiculous and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358151">
        the supernatural. The powers have simply reached their end and are now being forced to continue. This isn&#039;t all that uncommon in long-running shows. It&#039;s probably the reason Goku had to pass on his powers to Uub at the end of DBZ, or how the ridiculous filler season caused the demise of Rorouni Kenshin. In this case, Shokugeki increasingly blurred the lines between a cooking show and a supernatural ninja show, while the plot got increasingly cartoonish.<br />
<br />
Enter Noir, a group of chefs cooking for underworld crime syndicates, each with their unique off-putting personalities that one would think would cost their lives the first day on the job. Somehow, these chefs have a leader they&#039;d do anything for, which makes you wonder why underworld chefs need such organization to begin with. But they&#039;re invited to face off against our Totsuki cast because of some tedious God Tongue drama that discredits the cooking authority of the World Gourmet Organization more than Azami did, if rampant favoritism and nepotism means anything in judging chefs. The Noir chefs each come with completely ridiculous abilities -- as if it wasn&#039;t ridiculous enough before. For example, they knead meat with brass knuckles perfectly seasoned in each peak, or use a chainsaw so eloquently as to produce the perfect texture. Any thinking person would realize the speed of a chainsaw works against that goal. The head honcho steals chef abilities and combines them by touching their cooking apparatus. They fight dirty, kidnapping opponents while encouraged by the tournament director. Finally, for some reason, when they lose, they disband, as if their jobs no longer mattered due to a tournament. Really, the entire concept of Noir is a huge plot hole.<br />
<br />
The plot went from mediocre to shit. And all of that perfection built up between Erina and Souma in season 4 is inexplicably ripped apart and destroyed, to create an awkward, artificially manufactured dissonance, just for Souma to be given a moment recapture Erina&#039;s attention. It was fleeting and not at all what we should expect as the most important plot point in a five season show.<br />
<br />
In other words, the Fifth Season is superfluous, unnecessary, and devolves the plot quality in every sense. The character tensions feel manufactured, the characterization themselves feel altered for dramatic purposes, decreasing their integrity. Previous villains make a comeback just to make a happy-ever-after Hollywood ending. Even the current villains magically redeem themselves and everyone becomes friends. Yay!<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a long-time fan of Shokugeki no Shouma, give this a watch for more cooking action. Otherwise, skip this season and treat season 4 as the ending. If this season wasn&#039;t the conclusion, it would be the type of season to get a show cancelled.

The fifth season is very, VERY rushed, differently from the others season, on this one you don&#039;t even see they making foods, it looks like as the food magically appears on the table, understanding what and why they are doing is the essential part of a food anime, imagine MasterChef without the making of, just the results, it is a bad idea, isn&#039;t it? But it is basically what is happening here.<br />
Another very bad stuff that happened here was &quot;superpower&quot;,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357682">
        or something like this, I don&#039;t even know what it is, it&#039;s like &quot;The hidden power from the clan X, it has been passed down this clan for generations, using an axe instead of a knife&quot;, if the anime had introduced it since the beginning, there would be no problem, but the anime isn&#039;t about it, the author just created a new ability with no context. Imagine an anime like Monogatari, that at some point Araragi can now make Jutsu, it is bizarre, isn&#039;t it?<br />
Now many of yours could disagree with me, but there&#039;s something very annoying in my opinion, Foodgasm, and on this season it got worse, what is the point of this? In the beginning, it was okay, the people liked the food so much, that it was like an orgasm, but at this season, everyone around getting semi-naked... It looks like that the manga was getting less popular, so he put more fanservice, to make the buyers don&#039;t leave the manga.<br />
Now about the ending of the anime, if you don&#039;t want to get spoilers, skip this part<br />
<br />
[SPOILER]<br />
<br />
Comparing the final of the anime with the manga one, this one is a little bit better, just a tiny. Yukihira, after travelling around the world returned to Japan, meets Erina, and he makes a disgusting food to her, as always, after this disgusting food he says he&#039;ll make the best food in the entire world to her, and... it ends. It was good, bad? No one knows because it ended at this point. No romance, Erina never said she like his food, nothing happened! I&#039;m not Open-End Hater, but this ending was awful.<br />
<br />
[END OF SPOILERS]<br />
<br />
This arc is horrible, the previous arc was really good, and the author just ruined it, very rushed, nonsense superpower, exaggerated fanservice and a terrible ending. But there&#039;s still something good about this anime, the characters are still wonderful, I like this art, but it is probably the unique good part of this anime.

    I don&#039;t write reviews a lot because I usually don&#039;t care but I usually write reviews if I really like something or really hate something, this is unfortunately the latter.<br />
<br />
I absolutely love Food Wars, It&#039;s in my top 3 and I&#039;ve re-watched it multiple times, but this season is an embarrassment and a gigantic disappointment.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no character development for every single new character that was introduced and everything in this season so far has been incredibly rushed. The art, the sounds, the animation, the plot, absolutely everything is rushed and it feels like some mediocre trash.<br />
<br />
The series always felt repetitive and I was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354803">
        fine with that because there was still a plot behind it but now they have just relied on the repetition alone for this season and it&#039;s absolutely failed.<br />
<br />
They reused a bunch of scenes from previous seasons throughout this season and it just shows how much they don&#039;t care about the series anymore. This is truly an awful season and one that I absolutely can not recommend to anyone.<br />
<br />
At the time of this review the series is rated at 7.37 (Which will definitely be going down over time). I don&#039;t believe this score is an accurate representation of the quality of the season. I believe this score is so high only because it&#039;s Food Wars. If the series didn&#039;t have it&#039;s audience and fans backing up the show, this would have scored a 5 or 6 because this season is an absolute fail. <br />
<br />
I can not express how sad and disappointed I am for this series. It just keeps getting worse after the 3rd season.<br />
<br />
**SPOILERS BELOW**<br />
<br />
The new character Asahi is an absolute JOKE. Up until now the series was relatively realistic and believable but this new character just touches kitchen tools and he somehow masters years of cooking skill and expertise from just holding it in his hand? And supposedly he maximizes the expertise by x2...by just touching the tool.. <br />
<br />
Another chef that was introduced uses a chainsaw to cook and another used a guillotine and claws??<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know who the director is or who is in charge of this season but they did an absolutely awful job at this new season and I&#039;m honestly considering dropping this series all together because it&#039;s so bad. <br />
<br />

    I&#039;ve got a weird relationship with the last season of Food Wars! that&#039;s basically: it was average but I enjoyed it. <br />
<br />
So, the Shokugekis in this season weren&#039;t great, I have to say. It may have something to do with the fact that I&#039;ve been watching this anime for a long time, and I&#039;m used to the style so at this point it isn&#039;t exciting, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s why. The content of this season was way too outlandish. Food Wars! has always been surreal but never ridiculous, at least not on the scale it was this season. I couldn&#039;t get excited about the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357492">
        food being made or the battles going down because it was all too absurd.<br />
<br />
The overarching story of the BLUE tournament was interesting enough, and the prompts for the Shokugekis were cool. The story that developed Souma and Erina was mostly well done, and the writing was mostly supportive of the ending. It did feel a little overblown and a little convoluted, but I still enjoyed watching the characters struggle and prosper. <br />
<br />
The ending of the series itself was what I expected based on the manga&#039;s ending that got talked about when it was first published. I don&#039;t know that this season was the best thing in the world for finishing out the characters. The goals they had throughout the rest of the series kind of got lost, and a different conclusion was presented that was supposed to account for every loose end. Unfortunately, that didn&#039;t work out that well. That being said, I was fine with what happened this season, probably because I wasn&#039;t too invested in the ending. This season didn&#039;t feel like the Food Wars! we started out with, but it was still fun to hang out with the characters one last time. Farewell to Yukihira Souma.
