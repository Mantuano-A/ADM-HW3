    The award for the most misleading title goes to…! <br />
Probably not A Sister’s All You Need (AKA: Imouto Sae Ireba Ii) but it’s a pretty damn misleading name. <br />
<br />
It’s definitely caused a bit of confusion for people deciding whether to watch it or avoid it like the plague, so before I start the review I feel like it’s necessary to say what this show is and what it isn’t.<br />
<br />
This show isn’t...<br />
-A little sister romance.<br />
-A rip off of Eromanga-sensei.<br />
-Ecchi, but there are few over-the-top lengthy fanservice scenes.<br />
-A kids&#039; show, despite how the characters appear.<br />
-The horrifying events that occur in the first 3 minutes. It gets better

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266243">
        after that, I swear.<br />
<br />
This show is…<br />
-About the ups and downs of being an artist.<br />
-A character study. Yes, as ridiculous as that sounds this show is about the characters, not the story.<br />
-A (perverted) gag comedy.<br />
-Unfiltered. Characters do and say what they please. Be prepared to laugh and possibly to be offended.<br />
<br />
No time is spared in establishing the perverted tone.  Within the first three minutes of episode one, the main character’s horrifying sister fantasy is shown to the audience in grotesque detail. Later it’s shown that the main character’s editor is reading then spitefully denying his appalling work as he drops the script to the table (not unlike how I initially dropped the show after only that first scene). The start of the show may be a bit alienating to anyone who isn’t prepared for a sis-con, but it does a good job of preparing you for the show’s absurdity even if no other scene reaches the heights of the first few minutes. Don’t take this as praise though. The show knows where the line is between too much fanservice is, and it purposefully crosses it to get you to think about how disgusting the whole fantasy is. It’s self-deprecating for sure, but that’s part of the charm.<br />
<br />
A sister obsessed light novel writer, his younger stepsister, a perverted novelist, his plain jane friend, and a few more writers and publishers make up the cast. The story is small in scale, but it gives the characters plenty of room to develop. The main character struggles to come up with new material and jokes ensue around him in his distraction. He gets some absurd story ideas turned down by his editor. He spends a lot of time in his apartment with his friends playing games, telling jokes, talking about anime, and this all brings about plenty of funny perverted gag humor. If you can’t gel with perverted humor then I don&#039;t think this is the show for you, but give it a chance beyond just judging a book by its cover.<br />
<br />
Despite looking and acting like teenagers, the characters are used to adult life and often show their wisdom in conversations. They can be really perverted at times and seem like sickos but over time they grew on me. Through great moments of the character’s reflecting on themselves you’re able to get into their heads and understand why they are and what motivates them. For the characters to be so well developed it becomes easy to get invested in the ups and downs of their lives as they become adults. We learn about what formed them into the people they are through the many outgoing conversations they have with each other. They’re not perfect friends and their chemistry isn’t totally perfect, but the way they clash adds to their believability. I find myself justifying their actions no matter how deplorable by referring to the minor details that built their foundations as people. <br />
<br />
All of their weird quirks just make them so believable, the weird insistence on sisters that Itsuki has, how Nayuta only writes naked, and Miyako’s jealousy of lives of her interesting friends. We know these characters for more than just their weird quirks. We seek how they interact with one another, not just the main character, we get a sense of what their lives are like outside of Itsuki&#039;s apartment. Even the supporting cast of publishers, freelance artists, writers, mangaka, and just normal people all have expressive enough personalities to carry the show for the brief time that they appear to offer some wisdom or humor. <br />
<br />
I don’t gauge characters based on how realistic they may seem, I gauge them on believability. Could the characters in Imouto Sae Ireba Ii exist? Probably not, but after seeing what formed them into the people they are I’m more inclined to believe. <br />
<br />
[Story: 7/10] Practically a slice of life. No ending. <br />
[Character: 8/10] Well written, they offer a lot to think on. Believable.<br />
[Art: 7/10] Lots of sitting, not a ton of animation. Some hilarious imagination scenes.<br />
[Sound: 7/10] Simple op that gets minor changes from time to time, very chill ed. <br />
[Enjoyment: 8/10] Unfiltered comedy, surprisingly emotional drama, drawn-out fanservice scenes.<br />
<br />
[Final Score: 7.4/10]<br />
Not every joke lands, but enough do to keep it enjoyable. What had me coming back to it week after week was the realistic drama mixed in randomly with the zany comedy that would surprise me when my guard was down. The characters evolved into people I actually liked, not just the stupid pandering archetypes I initially pegged them to be. <br />

    This season of anime was one to look forward to, with popular series like Umaru and Gintama gaining new additions to their story. However there were a couple of new additions that have stood out as well (namely Blend S and Mahoutsukai no Yome). That being said Imouto sae ireba is my pick of this season. The reason simply being because its good at its genre. Compared to Blend S forgetting about the settings of their MC (I can only assume it has something to do with wanting the audience to actually like her) and Mahoutsukai no yome merely touching upon dependence rather than love,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266253">
        Imouto Sae Ireba is a story about a group of people finding their direction in life.<br />
<br />
Story 8/10<br />
A lot of you who just watched the first episode are probably bloody confused, the first 5 minutes in nothing but ecchi, and cringey ecchi on top of that. But thats where the protagonist fits in, his love is cringey/unconditional due to the experiences he has had in life, however this series focuses as much on the MC as it does everyone else, meaning that towards the end there is only one character who really brings forth these scenes.<br />
<br />
The story itself is episodic and whilst there are buildups that helps with the flow, that being said its not one of those exciting ones, just a warm and fuzzy story which is why I cannot give it a great score despite my liking it.<br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
<br />
The art is a bit more different from the usual anime,  that is not to say it isn&#039;t good, but its something to bear when watching the thing. There isn&#039;t much to say aside from that, but I do know some who were slightly put off by this art style.<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
<br />
Opening was great, thats one thing all the new anime have in common this season. But the actual bgm/ost in this doesn&#039;t really stand out. Once again simply because of the type of anime, but for the most part it compliments the story and doesn&#039;t feel out of place.<br />
<br />
Characters 9/10<br />
<br />
This is where the anime stands out for me, with an anime like this the characters are the focus and the story is merely a means to compliment them. You have the passionate MC who as I&#039;ve mentioned before is slightly eccentric, the reason for this was explored slightly too late for my taste, a mistake a lot of anime make, but even without the reasoning it should be too hard to empathize with. On top of that you have a small assortment of females, each with their own reason for being there and supporting the MCs. That being said there is none of the typical cat fights that go on in so many anime, instead its more of a slow paced romance that eventually falls into place.<br />
<br />
The relationship between characters is rather dynamic and there are many small changes in the story that put said relationships to the test, which is always good to see.<br />
<br />
Overall 8.5/10<br />
<br />
I personally put 9 in my score, but 8.5 is probably slightly more accurate. A good one to watch if you have the time and managed to muddle your way past the first episode but for those who are expecting an ecchi incest anime its probably better to give this one a miss.

    Y&#039;know, the realization of writing reviews on this site for four years comes with some vague existentialism of wondering if anyone actually reads the things that I write, or if I&#039;ve actually improved cause these things are just sort of self-proofread without my outside opinion.  Bah, I&#039;m getting ahead of myself.  Let&#039;s just get into this thing.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
First off, ignore the first five minutes.  As a writer, Hashima Itsuki is peculiar.  After getting an earful from his editor for the umpteenth time, he goes off on his usual schpeel about the greatness that is the &#039;imouto&#039;, before being promptly told to take

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266267">
        his work seriously and get his shit done on time, like any novelist with a deadline.  And so, that&#039;s...basically where our story starts.<br />
<br />
Based solely on its cast, Imouto Sae (that&#039;s my shorthand this time around) is a slice of life romp seen through the eyes of its literature-based cast as Itsuki and the rest of the main cast do what writers do.  Each episode is focused on the character interactions between the cast, whether it be for research for someone&#039;s book or spending time with one another through games that act more as a creative exercise for their brains.  The show&#039;s naturally lax nature exudes the slice of life genre, utilizing a brand of conversational humor with the main focus being what the oddities that are its characters and how they are as people as the brunt of its comedic prowess.  On the outside, not much really happens since episode after episode, it&#039;s basically the same thing, but slowly, we watch as more minute and complex matter arise.<br />
<br />
At times, the show ever so slightly shaves away its naturally fluffy and slice of life feel and touches upon the &#039;writer&#039;s struggle&#039;, or at least those relating to LN authors that adds more to the show.  We sort of see the individual problems that each of the authors in the show face, touching upon different personal problems that add a nice subtlety to the overall story as the sunshine and rainbow of everything we see sheds away for that brief, sober moment amidst the characters&#039; happily drunk nature being published authors.  <br />
<br />
Yet despite that, the one problem I see from the show is that nothing seems to change.  Sure there&#039;re events that lead one thing to another, but because the slightly deeper moments of the show fade away once they&#039;re over and leave but a shadow of their impact, much of what we get is the status quo which, while amusing, poses a problem when the moments of deeper thought were only just a few minutes ago.  The ending also leaves a lot of loose ends that I&#039;m not particularly fond of.  Kind of like a &#039;read the manga&#039; ending, but not so assholeish that they stop in the middle of some plotline that you&#039;ll never get an answer to. <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Provides a nice look into the &#039;writer&#039;s struggle&#039;<br />
+ Never melodramatic despite being a show featuring interpersonal relationships and such<br />
-  Tends to stick too much to the status quo<br />
-  A bit too many loose ends by the end<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
A connoisseur of the little sister, Hashima Itsuki is the writer of a magic academy series, or by its other name, &#039;trash&#039;.  (I jest, I jest.)  Initially seen as nothing but a pervert too prideful in his own work, Itsuki has many moments where his inferiority shows through the cracks, and the cheerful facade that we see through most of the show slowly fades away as he reveals his own insecurities as a writer.  As someone who&#039;s also been guilty of saying  &quot;I&#039;m not good enough&quot; to myself, I find Itsuki to exemplify much the internal battle inside someone who writes, with just enough of this hidden side of him to give us a proper character.  <br />
<br />
Despite that subtle complexity, the true star of the show (at least in my eyes) is Nayuta herself, the popular 18 year old novelist who from episode one has never stopped trying to get into Itsuki&#039;s pants without committing a crime in the process.  A natural prodigy at writing, much of her story lies in the events that led her to becomes the girl that we see her as now.  It&#039;s less of a writer&#039;s struggle, and more of a personal struggle, but all the same is done in a way that adds just enough to her character to give us the viewer some more information.  Aside from that though, Nayuta acts much like a supplementary character to Itsuki, giving him the drive to be the writer he always wanted to be.  Their relationship is cute, and I personally really like the direction they went to explain why things between the two are the way they are.<br />
<br />
To round out the quartet, both Miyako and Haruto act as similar characters with their issues, boasting a personal and professional struggle respectively that again, adds enough to their characters to bolster and solidify their problems as looming parts of their lives, like how normal people are.  <br />
<br />
Aside from them, the cast is filled with a cast of colorful weirdos that spice up the gaps that the main cast leaves behind.  Everything from an accountant who takes joy in the squirming in others to a mangaka who wears a ribbon of questionable material provides us with a weird yet amusing spectrum that makes the episodes that much more fun.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Rounded main cast<br />
+ Amusing side cast<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Produced by Silver Link, the show replicates the original artist Kantoku&#039;s style of the slightly muted color palette in conjunction of super shiny, almost reflective hair that&#039;s commonplace in the works he draws for.  Art quality is very consistent throughout due to the show&#039;s severe lack of need for any taxing animation (since everyone basically just sits around), and stands as a nice relaxing sight without anything bad to note.<br />

As far as fanservice goes, the show does have several choice moments that are certainly more risque than what the rest of the show is in comparison, but it&#039;s super tame, and if it ever gets out of hand, the show goes to use its various colorful slides with text on the front for &#039;censorship&#039;.  One of the most amusing ways to censor something if you ask me.  (Though I will admit that Nayuta is the cause of most if not all of these so blame her.)  Most of the perverted comedy is done through innuendos and spoken words, so visually, it&#039;s not severely apparent.<br />

Chouchou&#039;s &quot;Ashita no Kimi sae Ireba Ii.&quot; stands as a song that when combined with the visuals, harkens to the whimsy that authors feel when writing their works, the wonder than a person feels when they put their imagination on paper.  Personally, I feel like many of her other songs are more memorable, but this is no way a bad song and given the placement and usage of this song in the series, certainly has its impact.  <br />
<br />
On the flipside, Aria Yuuki&#039;s &quot;Donna Hoshizora yori mo, Donna Omoide yori mo&quot; is a more somber piece that ends the episode on a calming and closing note that compared to the slightly more energetic whimsy of its OP counterpart, gives us pleasing resolution to the episode rather than some seiyuu song or something that doesn&#039;t have much impact  <br />

Personal Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
I think my first reaction to watching this show&#039;s PV was &#039;Yes&#039;.  Not for really any particular reason, but it just seemed like the show I was really going to like.  And surprise surprise, it was.  It has the quality of touching on the personal problems and the insecurities and stress of making a good story and making a name for yourself in the publishing world without succumbing to melodrama or any kind of super contrived storyline which is refreshing in a landscape where anything drama-based resorts to melodrama.  It&#039;s a show I watched because I was intrigued, but stayed because I genuinely resonated with the characters having had tinges of these problems myself when writing stuff in my own time.  So for that, I appreciate this show and am really glad that this was something on my seasonal list.<br />
<br />
Did I like this show?<br />
<br />
If I haven&#039;t sung enough praises about my enjoyment of this show, then yes, I did like the show.  In particular, I really like Nayuta.  I&#039;m always a fan of girls who know what they want and earnestly strive for that person they love because often times you get tsunderes or some other stupid trope of girls undeserving of the happy ending they get in the end without rhyme or reason.  (Abuse is not love, girls)  But more than that, the relationship both professional and personal between Itsuki and Nayuta stands as one of my absolute favorite things of the show because there is reason why Itsuki doesn&#039;t take the plunge and overall gives more depth to the protagonist.<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this show?<br />
<br />
Nothing particularly irked me, but my only wish is that somehow they continue this.  The loose ends were vaguely irritating and given the setup that we were given in the last few minutes, a sequel is all the more possible from that.  (We do not talk about the first five minutes of the entire show.  That shit is repressed.)<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this show?<br />
<br />
Personally, I say yes.  Though the show is infamous for the first five minutes of the first episode, if you do get past that gate (and trust me, there is an explanation), you are in for a slice of life adventure that really is more than meets the eye.  It&#039;s a lax show focused entirely on its characters and their interactions, taking time every now and then to expand upon its cast to smooth and polish them out a little more for depth.  Plus it&#039;s got a nice helping of wackiness that makes things a helluva lot more entertaining than it should.

    When this anime started airing, I had high expectations because it had lots of potential and seemingly good characters but sadly all that went downhill mid season and it felt like an annoying chore having to watch the episodes weekly and even if that wasn&#039;t enough, it even ended in the most abruptly and weird way possible.<br />
<br />
SPOILER ALERT.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of the anime we had the MC who always tries his hardest at writing and yet somehow he doesn&#039;t make it big, we also knew that the MC had to deal with people who were much better and more creative than him so he always

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266245">
        felt inferior to them and that as a setting was very good and I thought we were gonna see some good drama from that but nope all that ended after episode 3 or something.<br />
<br />
TL;DR : The anime was extremely random and didn&#039;t follow any route or try to create and continue anything that it started.<br />
<br />
The anime then went after 2 routes:<br />
<br />
the first route was the game reviews we see in 4 or 5 episodes out of 12 which ruined a lot of things, it was pretty much filler at this point, some of them were nice but when 1/3 of the anime is game reviews then it isn&#039;t really helping it&#039;s case, is it? I mean if I wanted to watch game reviews I would open Youtube.<br />
<br />
the second route was the &quot;Every Male character has to have a Female character to end up with at the end&quot; route and it is self explanatory when you think about it, while I do hate those shitty cliches that wasn&#039;t the reason I hated this one, what I hated about this route is that it was extremely forced, one of the characters turned into a molester and yet the female character acted like nothing happened after that, The MC was suddenly in love with the heroine which is pretty illogical because at that time if he were to love someone it would be Miyako not the heroine, Haruto suddenly fell in love with a Miyako and that was pretty much the only thing that could be acceptable out of all the stuff that happened.<br />
<br />
The problem is that even after all that the anime didn&#039;t go through with neither the important stuff we wanted to see nor those routes it started, some episodes were genuinely funny and enjoyable so I have to give them that but the premise the anime had at the start vanished and it felt like watching an episodic anime where each episode has nothing to do with the others and that definitely wasn&#039;t what the anime was supposed to be like at least not from the start, after all that the anime ended in a bad way,the backstory we should have known about at an earlier stage (IMO) was finally out in the finale and a game review with pretty much the characters ending in a way that shows absolutely 0 character progression and lots of stuff that was supposedly meant to be resolved was left out just like that, even the part with the molester was supposed to be an introduction to the relationship of the little sister with the guy and yet even that didn&#039;t happen.<br />
<br />
The anime was a disappointment tbh and a complete waste of what could&#039;ve been a great slice of life.<br />
<br />
Overall I would give the anime a generous 4/10.<br />
Wouldn&#039;t recommend it to anyone.

    First and foremost, people need to stop judging this anime without actually watching it. So many of the reviews I see here are completely inaccurate, and it&#039;s pissing me off. Please? Actually watch the anime? Thank you?<br />
<br />
Now, getting into the meat of my review; this anime is not your run of the mill generic imouto anime. I actually can&#039;t stand that genre, and always drop it. In fact, I have refused to even touch Oreimo. HOWEVER, this has almost no focus on little sisters at all plot wise. The main character himself is obsessed with little sisters, but spoilers, doesn&#039;t actually obsess over a real

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263086">
        sister. Instead, you watch his interactions with his friends, his struggle to become a successful author, and his journey towards being someone he can be proud of. Each and every character in the anime has a story. They each own a flaw, and their personalities are all memorable. Although there&#039;s some stupid crap that pops up every now and then, like the first 5 minutes of the first episode, there&#039;s so much more to the anime than meets the eye. I never ever write reviews, and in fact this is my first one. It&#039;s not like this is my number 1 favorite anime or anything, (ATLA all the way idc I know it&#039;s a cartoon)  (also konosuba &lt;3) but it deserves a higher rating than just 6.79. Seriously??? You&#039;re giving this anime a 6.79??? The music isn&#039;t like orchestral, but I personally enjoy it a lot. The art is beautiful, with an extra wallpaper-esque picture at the end of each episode (which is a courtesy might I add). The plot is really light-hearted and fun with a dark undertone that is actually expanded upon. The characters are all unique, quirky, flawed, and relatable. As for enjoyment, frankly it is something I look forward to watching each week. People are just band-wagoning over anime like Black Clover, complaining about how crap it is, and then continue to watch it while completely disregarding actually quality anime like this one. This anime shows the struggles of being an author, the struggles of failure, and struggles of being unable to express your true feelings. I can relate to a lot of what goes on in this anime, and it always leaves a smile on my face.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I know this review sounded like a rant, but I don&#039;t care. How would you like it if your hard work was disregarded by the majority because they just assumed that it was &quot;like the rest of the genre&quot;. It&#039;s like the racism of entertainment. This anime deserves respect, and it is 100% worth giving a try. Now while in my opinion it&#039;s probably more of a 8.5 to 9 out of 10, I&#039;ll give it a 10/10 to help balance out the ignorant fools who give it 1s and 2s without actually watching it.<br />
<br />
Give it a try, you might like it more than you think you will :)

    100% spoiler-free. I write this review having seen only the anime, and mentioning only what is revealed in the synopsis above.<br />
<br />
Imouto sae Ireba Ii:<br />
<br />
&quot;Normie Barrier&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fanservice-driven&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trash&quot;<br />
<br />
I think every one of these labels is a great and common excuse for many people to stop or avoid watching this series. I think each is painfully inaccurate. I&#039;ll explain why I believe that is true, and why I believe this is possibly the best series I&#039;ve seen this year so far (clearly it is not yet finished). <br />
<br />
Anime, manga, and light novels are experiencing a dearth of material to bring the high school audience into early adulthood. How does

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264165">
        someone in or graduating college relate to the struggles of high school, which they are quickly forgetting? I wholeheartedly believe that Imouto sae Ireba Ii fills that gap in a meaningful way. <br />
<br />
The characters in this anime each represent the difficulties and insecurities of being in your 20&#039;s, whether that is through a feeling of inferiority, purposelessness, or pressure to succeed. The art and production aid the expression of these feelings with intimate depictions of each person that feel deliberate and compelling. There is a communal feeling in this series that is born out of a rich tapestry of relationships, allowing us to learn more about the characters without so much of the explicit and forced exposition common in the slice of life genre. <br />
<br />
The comedy in this series also demands greater scrutiny than a simple rehearsal of tropes. Viewers receive much of the humor from understanding things about the relationships between characters that they never could, and that pays off more with each episode. Music is mixed and reworked to frame scenes and enhance the comedic pacing. Humor is also drawn from some very common themes and concepts within the Imouto genre, especially the &quot;meta&quot; approach to storytelling, considering the protagonist is a light novel writer. The self-referential approach to comedy here is not necessarily unique, but Yomi Hirasaka accomplishes it with measured grace that tends to avoid pandering for attention.<br />
<br />
From here on, I want to take a hard look at the aforementioned labels/criticisms of Imouto sae Ireba Ii.<br />
<br />
&quot;Normie Barrier&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone&#039;s favorite talking point seems to be the beginning of this show. I will not waste time explaining why art needs a chance, but I will say that the storytelling proves itself to be demonstrative. Instead of being handed a list of the likes and dislikes of a character, viewers are shown through reactions and fantasies. Showing instead of telling is something far too many anime forget to do, especially for such a visual medium. Things that shock or confuse you can be difficult to ingest, but sometimes that reaction is necessary as a narrative device.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fanservice-driven&quot;<br />
<br />
If this series were driven by fanservice, it would be immensely different. I find myself laughing more often than not when it occurs, and I believe there are subtle cues that differentiate the depictions of this anime&#039;s characters from ecchi anime. I believe that the art does not contain the sort of detail in suggestive scenes that portends fanservice. I also think that the development of the characters justifies most instances of fanservice that occur. Is there fanservice for fanservice&#039;s sake? Probably. Is it a driving narrative force at any point in the show? Absolutely not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trash&quot;<br />
<br />
This show is in part about people with hobbies or occupations that ostracize them, and that is completely intentional. We cannot hope to understand the development of a siscon author writing novels without getting behind what makes him that. There can be a compelling story that does not focus on a main character with a traditional background or psyche. We do not need to be able to project ourselves on to any of the characters to relate to them, and that is the beauty of this anime. <br />
<br />
All of this said, there is a reason that I give this anime a 9 instead of a 10, and that is because I have to admit that there have been one or two short, one-off scenes that display some sexually aggressive behavior that does not have a purpose in the story. I did not think that these moments felt cohesive, and I am tempted to disregard them in my enjoyment, but I cannot ignore their presence in this review. <br />
<br />
In summation: Imouto sae Ireba Ii is a compelling representation of the trials and tribulations that come after realizing you&#039;ve grown up. This show displays a storytelling prowess that stems from the honesty with which it delves into relationships, and the synchronicity of its art and music. The common criticisms of this show seem unwarranted in the face of its intentionality, but that isn&#039;t something that a viewer could hope to fully understand in just one or two episodes. I encourage everyone to form their own opinion of this show, because the carefulness of its writing and production more than deserves that much.<br />
<br />

    Lets see here, what is the most memorable feelings i have after watching 11 episodes...<br />
<br />
0) The reason i started watching its because the art is GREAT! sadly, that&#039;s about it.<br />
<br />
1) Imouto is just thrown in there to bait people, the story is nothing at all about little sisters. <br />
<br />
2) Most of the story is spent trying to show the things that a writer supposedly does to get inspiration, which turns out to be pretty boring to be honest. getting in an airplane and traveling to different places in a day like nothing seems unbelievable. <br />
<br />
3) by episode 6, i still wasn&#039;t sure what the anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265743">
        was about. <br />
<br />
4) It&#039;s so hard to believe that these &quot;adults&quot; are SO gifted that they never have to put in any work, are always late with deadlines and are such POS to their coworkers, yet they manage to be some of the best writers.  would have been 10x more interesting to see what being lazy gets you in real life, problems. <br />
<br />
5)It feels like they tried to make this a &quot;different&quot; anime with the protagonists being adult but it doesn&#039;t feel special or interesting at all, other than they drink beer instead of your generic tea (such difference, much wow).<br />
<br />
6)there is somewhat of a tiny *hint* of a love triangle, which is only touched for the last 30 seconds of each episode, but that alone is not enough to justify the other almost 30 minutes of nothing really going on.<br />
<br />
Would i recommend this? Definitively not, i was very disappointed.

    At first, going into this anime, the first impression gave you of it is simple and filled with fanservice. However, it ends only there; it will just be another one of those all so famous Imouto anime you see nowadays. However, that&#039;s quite the false alarm, because, for me, I was pleasantly surprised to find out what this anime is actually like. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s nothing like what you might think at first glance; it&#039;s a lot more and to put it easy, its delightful, quirky romance with a dash of a slice of life added in the mix. I won&#039;t deny you will see fanservice now

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301955">
        and then, but then again, a tiny bit of ecchi has never hurt anybody. If it doesn&#039;t shove it in your face and it feels like a natural aspect to the anime, I don&#039;t see any issues with it.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
The anime follows a novelist, Itsuki Hashima who is quite obsessed with little sisters and tries to revolve his work around that. His goal is to one day create the ultimate younger sister novel. Despite its weird background for the plot, the anime delves into some realistic themes — both in his work and outside of life.  The anime is simple and straightforward, but it was a very entertaining watch for me, more than I am willing to admit. I would not mind a sequel because of that. <br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
The art for this kind of anime fits nicely, and it doesn&#039;t seem lacking from my understanding. It&#039;s cute, and moe, but have this certain mature vibe to it. I don&#039;t know how to put it any other way. Adding on, the facial expression and comedic moments hits well, and you don&#039;t see yourself yawning over how boring the art style is. It&#039;s simple but compliments the anime well and suits it well for this kind of anime.  <br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
Characters are all colorful and quirky; no one feels flat or dull. They all have something about them that can entertain you. Especially, a certain silver-haired female, Nayuta Kani. Without going too much into spoilers, let&#039;s say she is with a doubt one the reasons I liked this anime and want more. Her personality is so refreshing, and it&#039;s not something you see that much of anymore. She is to put it in laymen terms, quite the daredevil and unpredictable an overall super fun character to watch on screen, as her shenanigans with Itsuki unfold. <br />
<br />
She is my favorite character among everyone, but you have a good cast in here that feels alive and important. They are not just there to be there. The story might as well be around them, although, there is a set goal for our main character, Itsuki, that&#039;s no the only main focus here. It goes into the issue with making a light novel, romance problems which are handled realistically and don&#039;t come as forceful: even family issues and more, like the common problem you happen to come upon.<br />
<br />
The Negative<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the anime from start to finish; I never taught it was tedious or boring. Sure, some arc did feel slightly rushed and certain moments with the game they were playing was kind of weird, I wanted them to focus more on the characters instead of that. This is my only gripe if you take into mind it was only a 13-episodes long first season. If it had more to offer, I would probably ignore it altogether. Also, mainly this is just a tiny gripe, nothing more or less. My overall enjoyment for this anime was barely affected by this one thing. <br />
<br />
The bigger issue is that there is no sequel for this anime, and although, it&#039;s not a negative aspect by itself, it does fit in here so, there is that. However, all said and done; I never had any problems that made me want to drop it or yawn as I was watching it. It was a good watch, and I am hoping we get a sequel soon, or I might start the light novel instead. Since, I am very curious where it will go in the future, what more problems will arise and... I do want more Nayuta, so there is that too.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
This anime was quite a pleasant surprise, one I am glad I did not skip over and got to experience. It had a surprisingly good cast of characters, and it was kind of it to delve into some realistic theme making it for an exciting and fresh watch if nothing else. I would highly recommend this to anyone who doesn&#039;t mind ecchi and want something slightly different than the other anime which falls in the same category as this one. <br />

    Okay got to lay out some speculations-<br />
<br />
Dropping the first episode is a mistake actually, i know the first impression was totally offbrand or i don&#039;t know.<br />
I recommend that do not drop it because the Story and Comedy is good ( put some romance as well )<br />
<br />
So some of my words here have spoilers ( not that big deal )<br />
<br />
In the first episode was off, i know some of you knows, because it shocked me as well but getting through that is exciting and entertained me by what this anime showed, it is not a generic INCEST or some sh*t, i promise this anime is worth

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308864">
        it.<br />
<br />
Okay for the story for me is 9/10, why?<br />
<br />
- Going through a fun ride with 12 episode of this is soo good, specially episode 10 ( Itsuki finally admits that she love Nayuta but not enough to show that he love her cause of his current stage/status ) that episode really hits the mark for me, and not enough backstory for Nayuta&#039;s past ( It was Bullying ) and really enjoy this 12 episode.<br />
- THIS IS NOT EROMANGA-SENSEI, this is far better than that Incest.<br />
- I want more episode, yes i want more because i want to know if Itsuki really end up with Nayuta and achieve his dream<br />
<br />
The Art is 8/10, my opinion :<br />
The Sound is 7/10 , my opinion also :<br />
<br />
- Okay the animation was pretty decent for me and the sound is just too casual but never ruined the story and the progress of each character, well the animation is just too cute for me because look at Nayuta, Miyako and Chihiro, they are cute ( hehe )<br />
<br />
Character ? 8/10 for me<br />
<br />
- The development is just centimeters by centimeters, i got confused in some episodes but really research for that.<br />
- This anime is just introductions for the story ( not yet the full ) but the execute of s*x jokes really hits home.<br />
- Slow phase you have to read the manga for backstory of the main character.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT? 10/10 mlg<br />
<br />
- I love this anime ( idk why ) but truly, this is the first show i watched that the title sounds like INCEST but nope, totally misleading, it&#039;s just a guy who love little sister for his manga ( sounds incest but okay ) and his little sister ( Reverse trap ) does not want his Oni-chan&#039;s peepee <br />
- Really doubt the first episode but damn episode 10 just got spicy<br />
<br />
Overall ? 8/10<br />
<br />
- There is lacking some development and some few plot holes, but never really bothered me since it&#039;s easier to research<br />
- Not much to talk about but i do enjoy this better than &#039;Eromanga-sensei&#039; and &#039;my little sister cannot be this cute&#039; ( i do not like hardcore incest )<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So would you watch this ? Yes or No<br />
<br />
= Yes, it is enjoyable and romance was not the aim for this anime ( but the manga does )<br />
<br />
Recommended ? Yes or No<br />
<br />
= Yes, some people may enjoy &#039;just characters sit down play board games and talk about their life&#039; <br />
<br />
Nayuta Kani best girl ? Yes or Yes<br />
<br />
= Yes, she really deserves Itsuki&#039;s virginity and her&#039;s to be Itsuki&#039;s

    Do you like little sisters? Good, because our protagonist Itsuki loves them probably more than you do. I give this anime an overall score of 6, but that does not mean I think it is distasteful. In fact I think that some people will give this anime a 8 or 9, maybe even a 10. This review is a spoiler-free review by the way, but it would not hurt for people who have watched this anime already to read this review too. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
I acknowledge how the story may seem non linear at times, but I assure you that this anime actually has an excellent narrative.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review268783">
        The overall plot is Itsuki, an aspiring author, making his way through the light novel industry while passing through hardships. It is a story of friendship and comedy for the most part, but I would pay more attention to the background. This story is actually about a depressed young man who fights against reality, diving into his own form of escapism, probably retreating into his perverted light novels, only to realize how his peers have earned successes that he has yet to earn himself. For instance, one of his friends is a much more talented writer while the other has an anime in the works. Itsuki deals with his issue by not caring about it. As the anime goes on, you will find Itsuki making peace with himself, and I feel that this narrative would be enjoyable for literally anyone who has felt at least a taste of depression. The flaw to this narrative, however, is that it lacks a dark theme since this narrative only lies in the background, but the anime makes it obvious enough for an attentive audience to peace this together. So now that I have pointed out where your attention should be, I think you would find the story to be at least above average. (8)<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Given the silver link art quality, I thought this anime would be able to use art to its advantage. I was right in some parts as the art is often used to show Itsuki&#039;s room clearly and everything outside as a foggy and generic setting. Although it gives the impression that Itsuki himself views the rest of the world as irrelevant, I feel that scenes where some of the girls are naked are more horrific rather than enjoyable. Now that I&#039;m here, I would like to emphasize that the fan service is not good. I&#039;m not a personal fan of fan service, but the anime is willing devote 5 minutes every two episodes to only showing fan service to the reader. (6)<br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
<br />
This is the worst category for good reason. So I did not hear anything in the background, I do not know why. Maybe it is to illustrate how Itsuki is living in the real world, but I think it is because the show did not have enough budget. Nevertheless the opening and ending are great, but I think the overall soundtrack could be used to describe the anime&#039;s overall mood rather than a deafening silence. (4)<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
Earlier I mentioned how this anime is actually a narrative of a depressed young man. That was a lie. This anime is really a narrative about multiple depressed people that hide their flaws from each other. I&#039;m not going to say any spoilers, but I will just say that every episode has a little crack of the character and you will enjoy, or sympathize, with the character when he or she breaks. (8)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Please take this category with a grain of salt. I thought it was at best fair. I could see how other people would enjoy this anime more than I did because I really liked the episodes when the characters played board games, showing there inner flaws or making a spoof of another popular work, but I thought that the overall silence of the anime was very unfavorable. I suggest that you just pay attention to the character&#039;s dialogue because they really are interesting at times, and I also recommend that you treat this anime as a totally different work from the likes of Shirabako or any other anime with a Japanese entertainment industry. (6)<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
This anime has its ups and downs, but I just have to give it a little more than average. I predict that there will be many who enjoy this and many who don&#039;t, but it&#039;s really a coin toss. Would you be willing to toss that coin? I would. There is something for anybody in this anime, but if you are more of a edgy type of guy I would say this anime is not for you. (6)

    Many people will probably dismiss Imouto sae Ireba Ii. as another Eromanga-Sensei, or straightly drop the show after seeing the first minutes of Episode 1. People can’t blame them since the first episode was a giant normie filter. <br />
<br />
Nevertheless, you shouldn’t judge it based on just the first impression.<br />
<br />
If you’re someone who’s new to watching anime, or someone who’s not comfortable watching &#039;unconventional&#039; scenes, then this anime will probably throw you off. There’s a huge amount of sexual comments even in the first episode. The show doesn’t hold back when it comes to fan service. It’s a giant normie barrier. <br />
<br />
Your normie friend will go

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266327">
        crazy watching this show.<br />
But if you can overlook these things, there are many things that this anime has to offer.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s skip discussing the plot and focus on two things that makes this anime good.<br />
<br />
On Being Informative:<br />
<br />
These are just small details, but the little explanation they add on some topics was a nice addition. For instance, the hometown tax, a system introduced in Japan in 2008, was briefly mentioned and explained in episode 4 of the anime.<br />
<br />
You just learned about taxes in an anime that has “Imouto” in its name. The anime also gives information about different things like drinks every episode. An example of that is the daiginjo sake featured in Episode 6.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, it&#039;s not common to find an anime that can both inform and entertain the viewers.<br />
<br />
On the Characters&#039; Interactions:<br />
<br />
One of the good things about this anime is the characters’ interactions. It’s nothing spectacular but it’s definitely enjoyable. Scenes like Haruto and Itsuki getting teased, Miyako sympathizing with everyone, or when Itsuki struggles to meet the deadlines. We even get a general idea about the life of Light Novel authors in this anime.<br />
<br />
So..<br />
<br />
Should you watch Imouto sae Ireba Ii.?<br />
<br />
The show isn’t something spectacular, but it definitely has many things to offer. It’s a great and enjoyable anime that doesn’t have any complicated plot. Give it a try and watch a few episodes before deciding if you like it or not.<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;ll give it 8/10.<br />

    Most, not all, that give this show a low rating are people that haven&#039;t watched more than 1 minute of the first episode. The first two minutes are COMPLETELY different from the rest of the show and is only there for comedic effect (something it overdoes actually.)<br />
<br />
This show is definitely brilliant if you give it a chance, that being said it&#039;s not for every anime watcher. For a nice comedic and a little bit of a slice of life anime I highly recommend this.<br />
<br />
Do note that some of the humour is aimed at an older audience and some humour might be too sexual for younger

    Okay, first of all I want to tell you my English is bad. So if there is any wrong words, or bad grammar, please do not hesitate to tell me.<br />
<br />
why this series get low rate before end of the season ?.<br />
in the 1st episode. you &#039;ll got some weird scene in first minute. but i think its not the reason for somebody go jump here and give its low rate ?<br />
i&#039;m write this review after i&#039;m watching the 6th episode, its so great, and this&#039;ll be one of the best anime in this season (for me). <br />
If you looking some anime for fun, just watch

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263534">
        it. Its so refreshing, dont need think hard about complicated drama or anything.<br />
Great character development, every character have its unique development and background. Very clean story, no mystery or bla bla bla or something that I don&#039;t understand.<br />
the story is easy to understand.<br />
character is very lovable.<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY [9]<br />
in the first minute, I was confused very much, what the hell is this ! Are this is H genre ?<br />
But i remembered the character in the thumbnail, looks like something fishy, hahaha.<br />
Keep going if you like the 1st episode, cause i can feel the plot just only from the first episode. The story itself is very common. Its harem but not extremely harem, its romance ? I thinks it&#039;s not. Its just fun to watch no more no less.<br />
<br />
ART [8]<br />
The art is pretty good. well why I&#039;m scoring 8 because its to much loli wherever I&#039;m turn my head, its not to good for your health.<br />
<br />
SOUND [9]<br />
the opening very nice made, I love it so much. For the backsound itself very well, natural and flowing with the story.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER [8] <br />
They have good character, they build it very well, they build a very good <br />
in each character&#039;s personality, because its the main theme in this series. Every person has itself personality.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT [10]<br />
I love it, and I enjoyed the story so much! So much fun , not confusing, or something make blown your mind.<br />
<br />
OVERALL [10]<br />
even this anime is very standard plot and so so, but I&#039;m very pleased with it. It fun to watch and refreshing.<br />
<br />
I will update my review when the series ended. like i say before if there is any wrong words, or bad grammar, please do not hesitate to tell me, I really appreciate it<br />
<br />
thanks for reading.

    I wanna have sex with my sister.........Right..................in your dreams , Itsuki, so another harem with a mangaka author in the helm has ended which pretty much has a similarity from &quot;Eromanga sensei&quot; so, my thoughts on this:<br />
<br />
Mediocre 5, story:<br />
<br />
Pretty much the same setting and plot, except what we see here was more like a relationship of  a group of authors as they discuss things relating to their works and things that occur in everyday life, like deadlines, games, taxes, slump and nosing at some else&#039;s life. And there is that, main guy who has this fetish of having a sister, or wanting to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266313">
        in a incestuous relationship with a sister, that he doesn&#039;t have......oh he does have one , except that...either he knows that the step sister is just a cross-dressed bokuko or he&#039;s just plain stupid. <br />
<br />
Fair 6, Art: <br />

So Kani Nuyata has a habit of being a nudist when she is by her lonesome, so we have seen the girls being naked quite a number of times, but don&#039;t expect to see some frontal flash nor see any nipples or panties........  <br />
<br />
Decent 4, Art:<br />
<br />
No comment, nothing to say and I don&#039;t care.<br />
<br />
Pathetic 1, Character:<br />
<br />
So let&#039;s go over them:<br />
<br />
Hashima Itsuki- At first you might think that he the usual quintessential oblivious guy, who doesn&#039;t know about the girls whom were having feeling for him, until he blurts out &quot;I wanna a sister&quot; as it turns out,  he&#039;s siscon without a sister or has a sister (Step Sister that is) that he doesn&#039;t even know that he is a she. Also, he likes Nuyata, but has a lot of fuss about even having a relationship with her. There is Miyako, for some reason who keeps hanging out with him and his gang of authors who obviously likes him but keeps playing the oblivious card with her. So therefore for him alone the score was for him.<br />
<br />
Nuyuta Kani- I kinda like her free spirit and directness of liking Itsuki, but she kinda strikes me as a she pervert who can have some yuri sex with every female characters around here and still have some energy left to do it with Itsuki. <br />
<br />
Shirakawa Miyako- Is a fish out of the water around with Itsuki and his gang of authors. In fact she should have just left that loser, Itsuki for ditching college where he would have had a much better future than being an author  where your works are as good as your previous ones. To me , I see her character of being better off without Itsuki and his gang and going on her own with her classmates. So just hanging out with a loser like Itsuki, she&#039;s another reason for the low score in my book.<br />
<br />
Hashima Chihiro- Ok, so she&#039;s Itsuki&#039;s step sister who is a cross-dressed bokuko, so just how long would a guy take to know that he is a she? And how pathetic he was to not notice and it has to take Nuyuta and Ashley to know that she is a girl, so that another nail to the coffin.<br />
<br />
Fuwa Haruto- Well, he seem like a guy who is doing well, much better than Itsuki and Nuyuta in fact......Then again , I&#039;m glad he didn&#039;t get to be in a relationship with Miyako.<br />
<br />
Ena Setsuna and Mikuniyama Kaiko- one thing I can say with these two, which one of them is Itsuki&#039;s illustrator? Btw Mikuniyama, strikes me as some who could have sex with Nuyuta all day, while Ena, can pass as a sex offender.<br />
<br />
Ono Ashley- Strikes me as a harem girl who can have sex both with Itsuki and Haruto. <br />
<br />
And my fave character, Toki Kenjurou, my man can really kick Itsuki&#039;s butt.<br />
<br />
Good 7, Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Well, part of me really want&#039;s the possibility that Itsuki would either reveal that he always know that Chihiro is a girl and the he had a serious relationship with Nuyuta, but part of me also , want&#039;s to see him fail, good as it it, it is just not good enough.<br />
<br />
Fair 6, Overall:<br />
<br />
I may like this anime for the character&#039;s stupidity , but overall it&#039;s still a face palm.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Merry Christmas<br />
<br />

    Think about it, how hard being a novelist or mangaka? Just because people like watching anime, or reading manga or novel they can know how the writer feel. <br />
- Story -<br />
I like the story, it seems to be comedy, romance but somehow it shows appeal of each character. For each character, they have problem that show in certain episode, and it show how each character solved their problem. <br />
- Character -<br />
Itsuki, has serious side that show him how he loves little sister. This character show their other side in story. Kani, she fall in love with itsuki because itsuki help solving her problem in past.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263120">
        Miyako, itsuki&#039;s friends from college, she has kind character. I like how the character being develope in story, when the problems come to each character and solved it.<br />
- Overall -<br />
I like the story because it has similar genre to Eromanga-sensei, but it has more serious story. Just because the tittle A Sister&#039;s All You Need, it shows romance betwen siblings, No the story focus on how the character being good novelist. I hope it has more story that show each character&#039;s problem and how they solved it with some fresh comedy between character.

    This wasn&#039;t orignally something that I&#039;ve planned to watch in the beginning, having read the other comments beforehand. However one day, as I stumbled across it, I found that this anime is actually better than what most of us redeems it to be.<br />
<br />
Just to clarify, I only watched the anime, so this review is written with regards to the current episodes alone (5 ep up to now) without any insights from the original novel.<br />
<br />
Imouto sae Ireba Ii, an anime about a novelist and his friends, started off like any other daily-life animes. Compared to the others, one may think that the story is lacking in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262604">
        depth and in plot, having some weird characters and a plain MC. Nevertheless, there are some heartwarming moments inside each episode that kept me on my toes, while the story itself is very relatable, describing the daily life of a novelist and his struggles while depicting his social circle.<br />
<br />
Character-wise, all of the characters have a personality of their own. The MC is a sistercon; his brother/sister that&#039;s perfect in all senses; different female characters that interact differently according to their personalities with the MC; the competition in life; all of them is helping to shape the MC into what he is, and while many of the characters might seem plain in the beginning, as the story goes on, we are guided into understanding each of the characters, and why they are important in their own aspects.<br />
<br />
The music is pretty good, so far I am very enjoying the OP, and funny musics usually accompany funny moments.<br />
<br />
The art is our usual art type, nothing fancy, nothing 3D, but this plain art-style fits perfectly with the type of story we are looking at.<br />
<br />
TL;DR I am enjoying this anime as it takes up a different approche than most of the other daily-life styled animes, the story might be bland, but more details are given by each epsiode. Most of the characters are relatable and fun, the art and sound are fine and overall enjoyable. I encourage everybody to give this a try. :)

The only reason I didn&#039;t drop it was because I always pick a show every season and watch it precisely because it&#039;s terrible to make me feel thankful for the existence of actual good shows.( Previous season it was &quot;in another world with my smartphone&quot;. God damn it was bad lol ).<br />
<br />
The show tried to force kanikou down my throat and into my heart and it failed miserably. <br />
They went for the trope of the girl who&#039;s very &quot;lewd&quot; and always aggressively coming onto the MC but blushes and shuts down when he &quot;unintentionally&quot; comes onto her.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266517">
        I hate those.<br />
She also says Nyaa all the time for no fucking reason and it&#039;s very annoying. You don&#039;t get to say Nyaa unless you&#039;re a cat girl or you&#039;re just saying it in a comedic bit.<br />
Also why the fuck is this an imouto series if the main heroine is not even an imouto.<br />
<br />
There was no point in the orange hair girl(super boring bitch),the glasses novelist(thinks he&#039;s rivals with MC but it&#039;s one sided and sad lol), the mangaka(wtf.) and the ass fetish artist(so annoying , I thought it was a girl at first) even existing, they&#039;re barely relevant to the &quot;story&quot;.<br />
<br />
They also went for the &quot;make reference to other anime to make us seem cool&quot; trope, Bringing up Kobato from haganai, komachi from oregairu ,OreImo and Eromanga. Just to say that &quot;Hey there fellow kids! these shows are totally great and we totally love them too, please watch our show we&#039;re so relatable xd lol Fidget spinners lmao dab haha &quot;.<br />
<br />
There was only one moment in ep 11 that I found touching but it was concerning KaniTRASH so i didn&#039;t really give a shit lol. but other than that they just play board games and hang out all the time, like it&#039;s some shitty slice-of-life anime. It&#039;s so fucking boring and the &quot;comedy&quot; is so bad it&#039;s sad.<br />
<br />
The art like most other LN anime was pretty bland and got worse as the episodes went on.<br />
<br />
There was one soundtrack I enjoyed. other than that it wasn&#039;t anything special.<br />
<br />
I felt like gouging my eyes out while watching this show at least twice per episode.<br />
<br />
Then again if you&#039;re someone who enjoys trash imouto shows such as OreImo and Eromanga then you should watch it lol.<br />
<br />
P.S: *SPOILER*<br />
To the show&#039;s credit, I did laugh once. When glasses&#039; anime adaptation apparently turned out really bad. I was like &quot;Oh the irony&quot;.

    Now, I&#039;m going to be quite simple here. I&#039;m seeing that a lot of people dropped this anime early on/gave it a fairly low score. Please, DO NOT drop this anime. The first 6 episodes were essentially just memes, dick jokes and character introductions/getting us used to the dynamic of the characters. However, episode 8 brought a fairly interesting turn. I noticed early on, that the Romance in this Anime was kinda lacking. But, episode 8 changed that. After seeing episode 8, I can confirm that there is still hope left, and that this could potentially end pretty well. I won&#039;t spoil anything, but if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264099">
        you must, you can skip to episode 6 and start there (I say start at episode 6, because episode 6 sets up for episode 7). Aside from that, just go try this Anime out. <br />
<br />
P.S. The main character actually has a little brother. He looks and sounds female, but he&#039;s a dude. So this isn&#039;t really an incest/imouto Anime, but rather the main character just likes imoutos.

    I was expecting your average imouto loving trash from the title and the first couple minutes of the first episode but boy was I surprised! Instead it explores the world of writing light novels through an Imouto loving writer and his friends! Despite not being what I expected, I fell in love with this anime. It was comical to the point where I was laughing out loud but it was also balanced with realness and depth that made all the characters lovable to me. I never would have thought I&#039;d enjoy an anime about making light novels so much. I&#039;m praying for a season 2

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322188">
        but until then I&#039;m going to read the light novels! This anime is definitely worth a try and is one of my new favorites!

When I first saw this, it was for a list of perverted characters showing Itsuki because of his sister fetish and highly expected a poor anime with bad laughs and me being bored two episodes in; when I started watching, I never thought of how deep and almost realistic it can be. While watching this anime, you see how everyone struggles to be the best in an environment where even if you want to do it for yourself, you have expectations.<br />
<br />
I did watch the dub because I learned it had Jamie Marchi in it, who voices some of my fav characters like Ayame from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320226">
        Shimoneta and Lucoa from Kobayashi; but I ended up liking/loving all the voices of characters in the anime. Of course, there are those who may seem very annoying, but they have their own slice of humility and attraction. Of course, I&#039;ll watch the sub for the differences in both, but as for now, I never felt so satisfied in an anime since watching Ouran High School Host Club for the first time about 4 years ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: the story is about 3 light novel/manga writers and a college student going through different games from something simple as playing a game to something bigger as going on adventures and learning about each other&#039;s past. Each character have their own story and struggles and you can relate to each of their<br />
<br />
Art: all the characters look very pretty and appealing and I enjoyed it very much. I&#039;m usually someone who if something catches my eye, I&#039;ll check it out. I saw how not only it was visually appealing, but never once did I feel uncomfortable watching the moments compilations, I know I&#039;ll probably enjoy it; and I was completely right<br />
<br />
Characters: for the first time in a long time, I couldn&#039;t choose a favorite character; each one of them just surprise me with the depth they bring. With every episode, I thought I had a favorite nailed down, but then the next one, a different one just changes my mind. Itsuki is just hilarious to watch, Haruto is understandable with trying to be the best by conforming but not forgetting who he is, Nayuta is just the right amount of weird pervertedness with likability that you&#039;ll never get bored of her or think of as annoying, Miyako tries her best to understand her friends and cares very much; even Chihiro is just so cute and even though I knew that she was female, you would never get mad even if she was a guy. Even minor characters like Ashley and Toki and Satsuna are just so appealing in their own ways<br />
<br />
Complaints?: my only complaint is that it ended way too soon, but it never once felt boring or too much at once; it is perfect for a small watch but you just want so much more. I swear if there&#039;s no season two, I&#039;ll be so mad<br />
<br />
Overall: this was worth the 12 episodes if you have some time, but I really would like a season two cause I want to see how Miyako does as a part-timer or if Chihiro tells Itsuki about being a girl or even if the anime works out for Itsuki. It&#039;s worth the watch and I highly recommend if you have time to spare and don&#039;t mind ecchi in an anime.
