the animation looks pretty nice, the movements of Shiki vs Catsellan were pretty fluid! the effects added to the gravity were pretty nice and I love the way shiki&#039;s ether great activated.<br />
<br />
I like how the anime suggests shiki has a fear of bugs, I&#039;m pretty sure it wasn&#039;t revealed until much later on in the manga. It&#039;s a nice touch.<br />
<br />
overall I&#039;m very excited! edens zero is heavily underrated and slept on and I would say, where

        it is in the manga, its better than both its precedes; rave master and fairy tail. really hoping people can get into this with an open mind, instead of just judging it based on the similar character designs.

    You can&#039;t talk about Edens Zero without talking about how similar some of the characters look with other works from Hiro Mashima. This should not be a surprise if you knew, for example, that he made Rave Master&#039;s Plue into a Celestial Spirit for Lucy, but this happened again in Edens Zero with multiple characters, specially Happy. This reuse of designs might bother you, but it&#039;s just a characteristic of Mashima&#039;s works.<br />
<br />
It has the same light-hearted comedy setting which made me love Fairy Tail, but because this is a 25 episode series, the first few episodes are kind of fast paced, presenting you a new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401102">
        character in almost every episode and the plot develops really fast when you compare with long running series like Naruto, Bleach or even Fairy Tail, which had from 12 to 25 episodes just to present you the plot.<br />
<br />
The plot so far is interesting, but it&#039;s too soon to really say anything more about it. I really hope it gets a second season later so we can actually see how it will develop (yes, it is a possibly hundreds of episodes long plot and i love it).<br />
<br />
I remember some people complained Fairy Tail had a lot of static images in the fighting scenes, that&#039;s not the case here. I&#039;m really happy with the way they animated them.<br />
<br />
The main aspect i rate animes are enjoyment, and this really is something else for me. If you liked Fairy Tail, or even if you didn&#039;t, give this anime a chance. I promise it will at least make you laugh a couple times, then you can decide wether or not it is worth to keep watching it.

    Anyone criticizing this show for being a Fairy Tail rip-off is totally missing the point.<br />
<br />
ALL of Hiro Mashima’s manga are a rip-off of the one which came before. This man has only ever told one story, but that story isn’t called Fairy Tail, it’s called Rave. Rave is a generic, hot-blooded shounen action series about a guy with spiky hair and a blonde bimbo with big tits who go on a magical adventure to fight evil with the power of friendship. Rave was a massive, long-running success, and after it concluded, Mashima quickly launched a new series called Literally Who Gives a Shit, but seeing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419349">
        as this manga was not successful by any metric, it only ran for about a year. But Mashima didn’t give up, and in a matter of months, he came out with Fairly Tail. Fairy Tail is a generic, hot-blooded shounen action series about a guy with spiky hair and a blonde bimbo with big tits who go on a magical adventure to fight evil with the power of friendship. Does this sound familiar? Well, it did to the audience, because unlike Literally Who Gives a Shit, Fairy Tail was actually successful, and having learned his lesson, Mashima followed it up with Edens Zero: a generic, hot-blooded shounen action series about a guy with spiky hair and a blonde bimbo with big tits who go on a magical adventure to fight evil with the power of friendship. When Edens Zero first began in 2018, and I first saw people whining and bitching about the blue cat, Happy, being reused from Fairy Tail, I just laughed maniacally. The carrot-nosed Pillsbury Doughboy, Plue, was not only reused from Fairy Tail in Edens Zero, but was also a reused entity in Fairy Tail back from when he was a mascot character in Rave. So forget about Happy. This fucking guy rode through not two, but THREE of Mashima’s manga series. Are you seeing my point yet?  <br />
<br />
A month after the manga began, the scanslation site, MangaStream, dropped Edens Zero, stating via Twitter:<br />
“In case you’re wondering - we decided to drop Edens Zero. FT was the series we first worked on, so we felt like we owed it a shot, but… Maybe next time [Mashima] should try creating original characters, not verbatim copies. Just sayin’.” <br />
I&#039;m sorry, but the main guy, Shiki, is a copy of Natsu? The big titty waifu, Rebecca, is a copy of Lucy? Then what about Natsu being a copy of Haru, or Lucy being a copy of Elie? I’m not defending Mashima’s shameless lack of creativity—far from it—but if people are out here acting like one of his cookie-cutter stories is better or more sacred than another because they have nostalgic bias toward one and not the other, then I’m here to remind everyone ALL OF IT is trash. It’s the most basic-bitch, bare-bones, clichéd, hackneyed, battle shounen drivel that there has ever been, including Rave, by the way, which people have been accusing of ripping-off One Piece since before many of you were born. <br />
<br />
So, is Edens Zero good, yes or no? No, of course not, but it does have redeeming qualities. First of all, the animation is surprisingly alright. I’m not about to oversell this, but I expected absolute garbage, and that’s not what I got. The animation isn’t bad, multiple fights honestly look great, and the backgrounds are fine too. You wouldn’t think so with JC Staff, but this show had a fairly solid production, and their most impressive core staff like Kenichiro Aoki really got to go crazy throughout the whole series. The visual aesthetic almost ruins it, though, because the artwork is just so unbelievably bland. While Rave and Fairy Tail had pretty bad animation and subpar directors who never did anything visually interesting with them, Deen and A1 did an okay job with their presentation. This may be hard for you to appreciate in 2021, especially now that other shounen anime have spend years copying and exhausting their style, but the look and feel of both Rave and Fairy Tail fit their era perfectly, their art styles were memorable, and their colors had sprit. Edens Zero, on the other hand, looks dead inside. Everything about it feels deeply uninspired, even when the animation is nice. The music can be fun, but it’s largely unexceptional, especially in comparison to Fairy Tail which I think everyone agrees had a consistently fantastic soundtrack. But that really is what Edens Zero boils down to, isn&#039;t it? It’s just vacuous and forgettable. It has some technical merit, and I suppose it could be enjoyable if you just turn your brain off, rip it out of your skull, and throw it in the trash, but this is recycled plastic, and it barely even stands up to the original products, products which themselves were hardly amazing.<br />

    The characters look almost identical to their Fairy Tail counterparts, and THAT&#039;S FINE, because Edens Zero is clearly much more than a Fairy Tail ripoff. I want to write this  review to give my thoughts on a series that has received much (often unjustified) criticism.<br />
<br />
The elephant in the room is of course the character designs. Any one who has watched Fairy Tail (or Rave Master) will recognize that Mashima&#039;s art style hasn&#039;t changed much. People who call it lazy or unoriginal need to realize that the author is currently publishing two manga every week/month. For the sake of efficiency I forgive someone who has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400794">
        been in the industry for over two decades for using designs he is familiar with. In many ways he also manages to improve them, giving cool new outfits and forms to the characters.<br />
<br />
Eden&#039;s Zero easily surpasses Fairy Tail, in my opinion, in terms of its story. In the first two episodes alone, we get a deep dive into the main characters backstories, as well as short, satisfying action sequences (unlike the often dragged out fights in fairy tail). Shiki Granbell&#039;s backstory is emotionally powerful, and makes you care about him and his goals. The sudden death of all of Shiki&#039;s friends and family at the end of the first episode shocked me because of the unexpected dark and serious mood. Eden&#039;s Zero places it&#039;s focus on friendship without letting plot armor stand in the way of emotionally satisfying narratives. Shiki also is more humble and intelligent than Natsu, who I found irritating and unlikable. In the first episode alone he gets more character development than Natsu did in several dozen. His goal to make friends may be simple, but it feels relatable in a wholesome and optimistic way. Also, the animation is not one of the best of this season, but it has some sakuga worthy moments. And the music and voice acting is solid as well. <br />
<br />
Speaking of friendship, if you want something entirely without the cliches about the &quot;Magic of Friendship&quot; then this is not for you. The general themes are similar, but they are expanded upon in interesting ways. The quest to find mother, the universe&#039;s god, is intriguing in the same way Luffy&#039;s quest for the one piece is. I am willing to try to enjoy Eden&#039;s Zero as much as possible despite not loving Fairy Tail as much as I wanted to. If you loved Fairy Tail than I have no doubt you will love this, and if you didn&#039;t then I think it can offer a more enjoyable experience. For me, who tries to enjoy everything I read or watch as much as I can, this is a 10/10.<br />

    I may not have seen or been the biggest fan of Rave Master nor Fairy Tail (the latter being a lot more referenced), but it&#039;s clear that what Hiro Mashima is doing, he&#039;s doing it well. And Edens Zero may just be the culmination of the best of the best of his works, that say whatever you want about it being a Fairy Tail rip-off (which is true). In hindsight, Edens Zero&#039;s lore overall is much more interesting than the cluster-eff of botched executions that was Fairy Tail, and I&#039;m glad I gave it a chance because while I&#039;m not so much a Shonen fan,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419350">
        since Yuki Tabata&#039;s Black Clover made me think otherwise, I guess I&#039;ve gotta go for it, and came out pleasantly surprised. BTW, it&#039;s not a perfect &quot;10&quot; score like any fandom giving scores of that just to prove their point (I know I did for Black Clover, which is purely justified), but it&#039;s best said that you judge it for yourself.<br />
<br />
Where Edens Zero set apart itself from the predecessors of both Rave Master and Fairy Tail, it falls heavily on the story and plot (which is pretty much a character case study more than anything), which I feel is much more consumer-friendly and more grounded that puts it in line with most Shonen shows out there (other than starting out really badly because of the easily contrived plots similar to Fairy Tail). Where Fairy Tail took off with a fantasy-cum-adventure style, Edens Zero is more of the same, except now with the famous/infamous moniker of &quot;Edens Zero is basically Fairy Tail in space&quot;. Believe me, try to convince anyone that they&#039;ve seen the character designs of Fairy Tail from the likes of B-Cuber Rebecca Bluegarden (which is just Lucy Heartfilia in a sci-fi spin of a shell) and Happy (which of course the character design hasn&#039;t changed), and they&#039;ll just reek with a &quot;EWWW&quot; kind of magnifique facial expression. It&#039;s pure fantasy hilariousness if you ask me. Nonetheless, as you would expect of Hiro Mashima, the infamous &quot;Power of Friendship&quot; trope is still here, and despise it all you want, but it has worked for this prolific mangaka circa. 1999 with Rave Master, and it continues to be the driving force of his written story in all 3 works with variable execution fails or success.<br />
<br />
Similar to legendary managaka Eiichiro Oda&#039;s plot of One Piece where Monkey D. Luffy goes on a pirate adventure with the many now iconic mercenaries, Edens Zero copies that blatantly, but gives it a sci-fi spin of a mystery to find the coveted One Piece, er *ahem* sorry, the elusive goddess Mother in the space universe realm of the Sakura Cosmos. But that story starts with the character foundations, and this I feel is where Edens Zero really shines at its best. From Shiki Granbell, the boy who was left on a planet full of robots that were disposed to become a total scrapyard, to Rebecca and her companion Happy, whom the latter is an amateur but growing B-Cuber and the latter providing comic relief as usual, it really starts out being the conventional wisdom of the Average Joe that Edens Zero does nothing to change the viewer&#039;s mindset, since basically they&#039;re rehashed straight out from Fairy Tail. It&#039;s only the overtime effect that really changes how one sees Edens Zero at least trying to be something different from the accursed predecessors of a love-hate relationship, and the payoff is with the same tried-and-true in-heart talk bickering of &quot;just one more episode&quot; that only applies to the more persevering and persistent ones (like myself). And when I say that Hiro Mashina truly goes deep with the characters and their backstories, he&#039;s not joking that it evokes happiness that turns into sadness and anger, as replicated from the diverse character cast like the Demon King&#039;s Four Shining Stars (that pilot the Edens Zero ship with Ether) to the crew of Shiki, Rebecca, Happy, Weisz Steiner, E.M. Pino and Homura Kogetsu. Every character backstory is just as important to gear the story to its intended place, and for the most part, it really resonated with me the same way when I&#039;ve watched Black Clover before (because it&#039;s the same goddamn thing). It makes you want to feel for the characters who bore their side of the grunt in their own way through the pain and suffering, and that might easily come as a plot device, but it always works in the Shonen space, whether you like it or not.<br />
<br />
If there was a director that I could feel that he/she could do no wrong, it&#039;s Shinji Ishihira, whom more than his veteran experience of directing the OG Fairy Tail along with a few others (few notables being Heybot, Log Horizon, Munou na Nana and this season&#039;s Tsukimichi), he&#039;s a proven veteran taskmaster at what he does to keep the original source material fully adapted, with nothing left cut out (save for those that are mostly due to time constraints). This director knows what he&#039;s doing and doesn&#039;t beat around the bush in order to appease the audience with as much of the source material as possible so to judge shows based on the authors&#039; writing calibres. Another wonderful job done Ishihira-san with J.C.Staff, which really doesn&#039;t feel like crap quality and mimics the old 2-cour style consistency from years past.<br />
<br />
The music aspect, the VAs have done a good job voicing their respective characters, especially Shiki&#039;s VA Takuma Terashima and Homura&#039;s transgender VA Shiki Aoki, just to list a few because they provide color to the characters. No complaints about the OST when you have the awesome artistes like TNNK (Takanori Nishikawa) himself, CHiCO with HoneyWorks, L&#039;Arc-en-Ciel and Sayuri performing their OPs and EDs. I would&#039;ve pretty much preferred TNNK and CHiCO&#039;s 1st Cour set over L&#039;Arc-en-Ciel and Sayuri&#039;s 2nd Cour set because of the change in the tonal change of the story stratosphere, but they&#039;re good songs nonetheless.<br />
<br />
To enjoy Edens Zero is to have an open mind about not thinking that it&#039;s gonna be like Fairy Tail. Because as much as the resemblances are uncanny, it&#039;s the journey of the characters that make up the story that&#039;d make or break the experience of watching a standard tropey Shonen (that you&#039;d wish to unsee one too much). It&#039;s very Hiro Mashima-like, but finally in a good way to break the mould of the reputation he had for the predecessors with the narrative change. Quite enjoyed this one a bit, and you&#039;d be doing a disservice to pass this up like said series.

    This anime has the potential to become even better than Fairy Tail. Edens Zero is known as the &quot;Fairy Tail&quot; ripoff, but just because the art is too similar doesn&#039;t mean the series itself won&#039;t be good. Going through a space setting for this anime, Edens Zero contains aspects that differentiate from Fairy Tail in terms of how it&#039;s created by Mashima that gives the series its individuality. There are tons of differences in the Edens Zero anime adaptation that pales in comparison to Mashima&#039;s previous works.<br />
<br />
The plot itself is simple, with a goal that may take forever. But along the way has the main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419365">
        cast visit various planets in hopes of accomplishing that goal. The world-building is an improvement from previous works from Mashima. Not only did it show what each planet was like, but it further showed how important each of them was for the cast to grow as characters, and that was well done. The power system is unique but intriguing to learn more about how Ether functions towards certain users. I love the creativeness in abilities, such as gravity, swords, and other types of skills. It doesn&#039;t focus on one specific superpower used by multiple users, and it gives the characters their uniqueness. Another aspect that I liked is the darkness this series has shown so far. Not only was it well-written, but it foreshadowed how Edens Zero will not be light-hearted all the time, and it will get intense as the series goes on. Mashima doesn&#039;t use the usual power of friendship trope that often, so that&#039;s also a respectful choice to make as that trope can be overused.<br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t anything too special, but I liked the build-up each of the arcs had towards the series&#039;s future. It starts with the main female of the show arrives at the main character&#039;s home planet and meets him. Eventually, he leaves with her to go and reach their goal. This first part focused on time travel and a rescue mission while gaining new crewmates in the process. The anime may overuse the fanservice in this adaptation, focusing on the fight scenes and progression to the story, and that aspect was well done. The second half was more focused on the introduction of new characters and the development between the ones that appeared for longer. Most of their backstories were emotionally driven, and it showed how those characters have been through much pain in the past but can overcome it with the present. Combined with the occasional darkness, the story will progress even more with actual character development for the main crew.<br />
<br />
Despite the same face syndrome shown in the characters, they were still enjoyable to watch, not to mention there have been differences in their abilities and importance in the series. First off, Shiki may look like Natsu from Fairy Tail, his backstory shown how he won&#039;t be relying on the power of friendship trope but has a different goal in mind. Similar to another series that will release its anime adaptation this month, he wants to make over one hundred friends across the galaxy. From there, it makes Shiki relatable to those that want to make friends as he does, and I liked that in his character along with his Ether Gear ability. As for the main female character, Rebecca herself has the potential to avoid becoming useless, and her development as a character deserves respect. All of the other crewmates of Edens Zero were fun to watch, but a recurring character, Happy the cat, bothered me a bit. At first, I was disappointed how Mashima reused a character from a previous manga to a new one, but his ability to turn into guns took away that factor. The main antagonist has yet to be revealed in the story. But in the future, the minor villains may be explained some more and eventually lead to some plot twists within the series if executed properly.<br />
<br />
As much as I liked Fairy Tail, the animation in Edens Zero was way better than the second half of the former series. Actual movements were going on, and it rarely used slideshow animation for a majority of the fight scenes. Shiki&#039;s gravity ether gear, in particular, was well animated. It showed how it functioned while making the manga panels for those scenes come to life. However, the reuse of certain scenes wasn&#039;t the best part, and it took up too much time for the episode it&#039;s featured. Although the animation still has its flaws, choosing JC Staff as the studio for Edens Zero was the right call. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack was pretty exciting during the first half. The opening and ending sound amazing. It gave the impression of the journey&#039;s beginning and how it will be exciting to watch while getting a glimpse at the Edens Zero crew&#039;s personalities. The second half of the series had calmed down a bit in terms of how the music sounded. The opening itself showed how we&#039;re beginning to get adjusted to the series, and that there will be more to come later on in future adapted episodes. The ending for the second cour was bittersweet, focusing on the characters&#039; past while showing how far they&#039;ve come since those events occurred offscreen. The sound design is incredible, especially during the use of Ether Gear. The sound effects are satisfying to hear and bring on the impact of each ability shown throughout the series.<br />
<br />
Overall, Edens Zero improves on the mistakes Fairy Tail made and turns them into improvements that make the anime better. It would be wise not to refer to Mashima&#039;s same face syndrome that&#039;s shown in the characters and focus on how the story will progress as it continues. I hope the anime will be able to properly execute the further chapters at this level of quality. Once again, if Edens Zero fixes the flaws that Fairy Tail had, then it has the potential to surpass Fairy Tail and previous works from Mashima as the best adaptation of his manga.

    Utter Trash<br />
<br />
I have no idea what I thought when  picking up this show but it has been 6 months of pure fuckin pain. I have not found anything funny except the entire character named Nino who not only thinks anime will save the universe but he also thinks the manga was better. Both are correct statements<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s hop on to some other shit. The characters are honestly bland who have no reason to even exist. Shiki is very generic shounen MC with bullshit powers in his case it is gravity manipulation. He just wants to sail the universe and find this cosmic being called &quot;Mother&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419375">
        Rebecca is your average E-Girl who will thot her way to B-cube Stardom. She hangs around with her partner and her gun named Happy, who is just the fairy tail character. We have Homura who is quite advanced samurai. She is honestly pretty decent. She also can&#039;t stop thinking out loud cause why not. Weisz is kinda edgy man from the past who went to the future just because the time has broken in a certain city. Pino is just a talking Electro Magnetic Pulse Bomb aka EMP. That&#039;s her name. Some others who I don&#039;t even bother with but the god and saviour Nino.<br />
<br />
Story is pretty much the same janky mess as everything else in this show. Shiki gets picked up from the god knows where and goes to follow his dream. Along this said trip he meets new people and starts to remember who he is exactly. We visit the past, the cosmos, a literal mmorpg and even your average slave economy. Who could have thought that the universe has fuck all to give us mere mortals. <br />
<br />
The Animation sometimes is pretty decent but nothing ground breaking. Sometimes it is just not nice to look at. Just like a slideshow at some points. Maybe it has to do with the character models looking a bit odd at times but who knows<br />
<br />
The comedy has been absolute garbage. I have not laughed at all except when Nino arrives and talks about how manga is better and such. Otherwise it has something to do with the character quirks they have or sometimes even related to the ridiculous amount of Fan Service which in turn makes the show just worse<br />
<br />
Of course the Fan Service has been a thorn in my side since this show started. So many stupid thing here and there and even some weird ass fetishes such as Human Furniture combined with the change of state. So some rich ass ugly bastard wanted to turn hot girls into stony chairs. Of course there was the basic lewd outfits, pantyshots and even bunny outfits. <br />
<br />
The opening and ost I have nothing to complain about.<br />
<br />
So in short this show is just pure garbage and need to be stopped. 1/10. I would give a 0/10 if it was possible.

    Well, Fairy Tail was at least enjoyable up until episode 40.<br />
After that it started becoming bland, cringy and inconsistent.<br />
<br />
Edens Zero, meanwhile, did not take long.<br />
8 episodes is enough for me to drop this shit show.<br />
I tolerated it until episode 12 and it was enough for me to confirm that this series is not going to cut it.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: The character depth is shallow. A blatant recycle of his previous works; Fairy Tail and Rave Master.<br />
<br />
MUSIC: Nothing too fancy. Far cry from Fairy Tail.<br />
<br />
STORY: The setting in space SHOULD make it an interesting story, but it does not. The story does not make you want to know

          <span style="display: none;" id="review412360">
        more about it. If you&#039;re familiar with Fairy Tail, then the plots become too predictable.<br />
<br />
Basically, EVERYTHING about it is un-interesting.<br />
<br />
Edens Zero should be considered as SELF-PLAGIARISM because the amount of recycled materials from Fairy Tail and Rave Master is astonishing!

    After watching the current 12 episodes of Fairy Tail&#039;s successor. Time for a temporary review:<br />
<br />
The show has potential. I didn&#039;t get bored all at (I will give it that). and it could get better in the coming up episodes. I hope it does, however; I have a couple of issues which I will explain mixed with the things I did like:<br />
<br />
1 - Character designs: I don&#039;t like to see the FT designs all over again. Shiki is literally Natsu and Rebecca is literally Lucy. And we have even worse cases like Elcy/Elsa. Pino and the sister&#039;s design are fine.<br />
<br />
2 - Characters over all: I don&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405624">
        particularly hate them but I still don&#039;t care about most of them. Shiki is fine for now, the 2 sisters we&#039;ve seen up to now are okeyish. Pino is everything right about this show (love her design, her voice, her dialogues, everything). I hate Happy like I did in FT.<br />
<br />
3 - Plot: For now it is okeyish I guess. Let&#039;s see how it develops. Although I don&#039;t like how they solved the issue on planet Guilst (it had a dark theme but ended up being solved in a very very convienent way). For now it is not boring and I didn&#039;t feel friendship power like in FT (for now, we&#039;ll see). Most of the villains are mediocre/clowns but to be fair (this just started so I will wait).<br />
<br />
4 - Fanservice: Although I like fanservice to certain extent, I don&#039;t enjoy it when it is being shoved in my face. FT had an issue with this and Edens Zero doubled down on this resource. I didn&#039;t like Lucy&#039;s scenes and I don&#039;t like Rebecca&#039;s either Mashima :V get a grip &amp; focus on the other plot.<br />
<br />
5 - Action/Animation: The drawing style is consistent but I have an issue with the action scenes where instead of having a fluid fight they just show the semi-slideshow kind of animation where you are shown the final move of every attack instead of the motion that produced such attack (you know what I mean). I don&#039;t mean to disrespect the animators but to me this is a little bit lazy and FT had the same issue. But at least it is not a NNT type of thing.<br />
<br />
6 - Comedy: Most comedic situations are...not funny.<br />
<br />
7 - Other stuff: The word FRIEND/S. PLEASE, if Shiki or anybody in the show keep saying the word &quot;friend&quot; every five minutes, my head will explode. We understood in the first episode so stop.<br />
 <br />
To sum it all up, I don&#039;t hate the show, kinda liking it. It has its issues but it&#039;s still early so I am giving it a 6/10 temporarily with the potential to go up.

    I don&#039;t really understand all the hate for this anime , just because it uses similar character designs to fairy tail . Even though there are a lot of similar elements , the story and setting manages to be very fresh and enjoyable.  This anime managed to get me hooked on the first episode . The space theme is very underused for the shounen genre and manages to maintain a sense of awe throughout with constantly introducing new things in every episode . eg ) what kind of new planet / technology are we going to see in this episode ?? <br />
<br />
I also think

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402011">
        it is really unfair to judge an anime just because you didn&#039;t like the characters from another story . Just give it a fair chance and you will definitely think that it is better than most people make it out to be

    As a casual enjoyer of Fairy Tail and as someone who has never read/watched Rave Master, I can honestly say I enjoy this series more than Fairy Tail, though I don&#039;t want this review to be filled with Fairy Tail comparisons however, so I will try not to do that.<br />
I am fully caught up with the manga and I plan on keeping up with the anime throughout is scheduled 25 episodes.<br />
As an adaptation, those over at J. C. Staff are doing an AMAZING job breathing life into the atmosphere that the manga presented. The characters are drawn in a nice clean style that&#039;s reflective of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403139">
        the manga and different enough from Mashima&#039;s previous works.<br />
<br />
The sound design of these episodes is phenomenal with the Ether Gear sound effect having a mechanical, rev-up sound and even the voice acting and music are great as well.<br />
<br />
Contrary to popular belief, this is not just &quot;Fairy Tail in space&quot; and most of the people saying that are only saying it because it&#039;s made by the same author and the artstyle is the same. Hiro Mashima likes taking old designs and repurposing them in his new works. This, to some, comes off as &quot;lazy&quot; but I do not AT ALL see it as a problem. Seeing as there are so many new unique and interesting designs and only 3 characters that are straight up pulled from Fairy Tail design wise. If that makes it hard for you to seperate the 2 series in your brain then you might not like it, but it&#039;s by no means a bad thing to carry over designs and repurpose them for a new series.<br />
<br />
Obviously I am in love with thise series and I hope people give it a fair chance, rather than looking at the art and riding it off as &quot;Fairy Tail in Space&quot; when in reality, they&#039;d be missing on a good story with fun loveable characters and so much more that sets it apart.

    It’s an okay anime. The story is fine, but the aggressive fan service and nudity really takes away from the plot and main character. The female characters seem to be all sex appeal and lack development or real personality so far. The time aspects of it are a bit confusing to me. It really does feel like a show created to appeal to Fairy Tale fans. It definitely isn’t anything special. It’s nice background noise at least. I don’t think it’s an anime I’d recommend it to anyone first, maybe if they wanted something they didn’t  to think about while watching.

    I just want to clarify one thing ,This is not Fairy Tail ripoff and it won&#039;t be any more<br />
It is not a fun adventure ,sure starts as casual shounen but differs arc by arc believe me it gonna get bloody and gore dark adventure ,if you don&#039;t believe me go and read manga<br />
I see some idiots in comments without even watching watching full 25 episodes started to talk trash, as if they have seen and know everything ,please don&#039;t mind them ,<br />
I admit <br />
Season 1 is general start as most shounen ,<br />
<br />
but Season 2 will show the true Theme and potential of Edens zero, This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420326">
        show doesn&#039;t care about  either hero&#039;s or Villains everyone has to face consequences you will find it season 2 onwards. People don&#039;t mind biased people they can&#039;t get happy and won&#039;t let other stay happy<br />
<br />
Every show has a turning point and it won&#039;t be in starting episodes, <br />
for eg: take one piece when did it pick on nearly after 60+ episodes ,it would not have a big hit if it was trash talked for beginning episodes so does other shounen series<br />
If you don&#039;t believe me go reviews from non biased youtubers who trash talked FT are even acknowledging edens zero or just read manga you find it yourself why it has potential to be future shounen.<br />
Coming to characters some idiots complain they don&#039;t have depth ,sure every character is not introduced with back story as in one piece, not every anime does that,but characters get deep arc by arc in EZ as revealing process,<br />
<br />
Please don&#039;t decide basing biased people comments they trash talk if the show turns out be great they won&#039;t even be honest to admit it,just give it a fair change a few episodes can&#039;t reveal the true theme of any shounen in the world<br />
<br />
From S2<br />

Death/Consequences: Critical<br />

Mainly &quot;No Power Of Freindship&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah shiki is obsessed with friendship theme that doesn&#039;t mean he gets power from it<br />
I have read 162 chapters and Haven&#039;t seen POF  and challenge anyone to prove me wrong<br />
<br />
He uses gravity ether even he says &quot; Fight for friends&quot; he uses ether gear brilliantly to win not by POF some idiots only Caught friendship statement and goes on trashing they are dumb enough to understand the intellect he is using with ether gear<br />

    I almost turned down this anime from the first episode. Until the very end, when I realized I was actually crying and had become very emotional. And I realized the depth that was being sought after and achieved in this first episode. <br />
<br />
After that it becomes a very laid back life discovering adventure. With overtones of great mystery revealing itself. But it is an anime that can make fun of itself, and take the seriousness out of of dialogue. Enjoy<br />
<br />
It has alot of sexual emphasis, but whatever, this is anime! Go for the ride and it might be fun.

    To start out my review, I haven&#039;t seen/or touch any Hiro Mashima works. Edens Zero is my first.<br />
<br />
Story(8/10): Shiki is your usual shounen protagonist who like going on a adventure. Throughout the whole shows we stop at planets that have their own uniqueness. Even though it not groundbreaking, this shows offer nonstop hype moment &amp; tearjerker. Imo, I preferred the 2nd half over the 1st cour.<br />
<br />
Characters(8/10): The characters are the best aspect of Edens Zero. Longtime anime fans will try to undermine their significance, but, they give me a vibe of early 2000s shows. Shiki is fun to watch on screen. Rebecca(B-cuber) is the best

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419370">
        heroine from what I seen so far. Homura is very adorable when she sprouted her inner-monologue. Weisz is a awesome professor. <br />
<br />
Four Shining Stars is a whole other story. <br />
<br />
Art(8/10): Gosh, every scene can be a background material. Some shots reminded me of Osamu Dezaki &quot;Pastel-Chalked&quot; freeze frame(*but very vibrant*)<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(8/10): I highly recommend it to those who love early 2000s shounen. <br />
<br />
Side note: Can&#039;t believe I enjoyed this shows more than other seasonal shows that came out this years.

    How to start? Well, I&#039;ll start by saying that I&#039;m not the biggest fan of Fairy Tail, especially 3rd season which I really hated, so take a note that I&#039;m not some kind of fanboy.<br />

I was sceptic when I first time saw this show, especially the character design, looking just as fairy tail, but after all there is not too many characters looking 1:1 like in FT tbh. And the art style is normal to be similiar in works of the same mangaka. The story is looking very bad in episode one, typical bs about friendship, but surprisingly in a positive way, it changes after

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411786">
        about second episode for something much more proper for this kind of show. For now it already shares a few classic shounen tropes, but as long as it&#039;s well made there is nothing to complain. When it comes to art, its good. The planets are diverse and very good looking, the same about characters, very colorful stylistics of everything. When it comes to sound, enjoyable first opening and ending, second opening a bit worse in my opinion, but we got a bit better ending instead. Soundtracts are well fitting the scenes, and they are making the enjoyment higher. Now is the time for characters, I&#039;ll talk about only a few main ones:<br />
-Shiki: our space Natsu, quite avarage shonen mc, but likable and and funny, rarely annoying, especially after first 3 episodes<br />
-Rebecca:Lucy&#039;s counterpart, well, in terms of character she&#039;s better than Lucy in most aspects, doesnt look too weak, sometimes does something, also she&#039;s not that dumb as Lucy was, her robo-Happy is also nailing it, but she has those typical Lucy traits, such as over revealing outfits, some echi scenes, and things like that, and for me, as somebody who found it annoying in FT, it visibly lowers my score for this part and overall for this show<br />
-Weisz: Han Solo of this anime, almost impossible to hate him, interesting writing of his story, did not expect it totally, has some rly funny scenes imo, waiting for more<br />
-Homura: appearing a bit later than others, but very welcome, interesting and funny personality, while we are still waiting for more development for her, incoming in next episodes, I liked her almost immediately<br />
<br />
For villains, we are mostly getting typical small villains, tho we can see, that more interesting ones await us in the future.<br />
<br />
Overall, I can truly say that I really enjoyed those 17 episodes. and I would recommend not to be deceived with character&#039;s look and first two or at maximum 3 episodes, and give it a chance. If someone liked those Lucy-style echi jokes, the score for the series can even score 8, tho I personally would rate is as 7.5<br />
Overall, I can say that this show is a good one as for light science fiction is last few seasons.

    Honestly edens zero is such an underatted gem.<br />
People keeps on hating on it and refuse to watch it because they think its a fairytale rip-off and as you know fairytail isnt really good and got lots of haters.<br />
<br />
But believe me this really good! This is so good and way better than fairytail.<br />
Of course the characters looks almost the same as the characters from fairytail bc their from the same creator. The one who made edens zero is the same guy who made fairytail.<br />
<br />
Story: The series isnt really about &quot;the power of friendship like fairytail&quot;<br />
It isnt LOL. It takes place in more futuristic setting. In outer

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420696">
        space!<br />
Overall i&#039;d rate it an 8 its so good if you compare it to season 1 of fairytail in my opinion 😅 No hate to fairytail tho!<br />
<br />
Characters: Shiki the mc is like a combo of natsu and gray combined. I mean They&#039;re overall appearennce combined. Rebbeca looks a lot like Lucy but shes better.<br />
<br />
Animation: Its alright. Its a 7 for me and a glowup for up edens zero/fairytail series i mean look at fairytail season 1 but hey ft s1 was made in 2014 so ofc the animation isn&#039;t good!<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall an 8 or an 8.5 for me Im sorry this is a bad review! This my first one soo<br />
but u definitely recommend people to watch edens zero! Its great and it doesn&#039;t deserve to be hated and rated low :(<br />
<br />
<br />

    I&#039;ve only watched a few episodes so far and ahhhhh the amount of serotonin this anime gives me. (I&#039;m currently reading the manga too!). <br />
<br />
As someone who basically grew up watching Fairytail, I genuinely think Edens Zero is nothing like it. Honestly, the plot is pretty unique, and (okay, maybe the &#039;friendship&#039; troupe is used every now and then but, it&#039;s got its own charm haha). I personally like seeing random Fairytail character designs and references being made in the anime; it&#039;s sort of nostalgic. <br />
<br />
Idk why but episode 3&#039;s ending really stood out to me (pls I almost cried) <br />
<br />
Really excited to see where

Reasons you might like Edens Zero/Reasons you might think you hate it. :p<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Reasons for watching Edens Zero and why you will love it:<br />
<br />
Eden Zero is Created by Hiro Mashima the creator of Rave Master &amp; Fairy Tail. Both are very great series that I have given 10/10 Both manga and anime! If you are a fan/ Giant fan you will  100% like Edens Zero through and through.<br />
<br />
You like the Shounen/battle genre. Examples are in my own Shonen Ranking order: Bleach, Naruto, One Piece, Rave Master, Fairy Tail, Hunter x Hunter, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Dragonball, Blue Exorcist, My Hero Academia, Black Clover Demon Slayer, Jujutsu

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414921">
        Kaisen. Etc!!! All of which I have rated with 10/10 and deserve it!<br />
<br />
Great story and insane world-building and one of the wildest fantasies ever seen! <br />
Hero Mashima’s world-building and story &amp; writing skills are out of this world and those are simply facts whatever your opinions may be. Whether you are a big fan or hater. <br />
Mashima is a Beast on a level comparable to another beast known as Eiichiro Oda!<br />
I personally call them the 4 divine Beast Gods, along with Masashi Kishimoto and Tite Kubo!<br />
<br />
Fanservice if you enjoy fanservice, then you will enjoy Edens Zero even more!<br />
<br />
Great animation: Although J.C Staff doesn’t have too much experience with Shonen/battle animation compared to other studios, they have made plenty of great anime series. They excel in the Romance, Ecchi, Adventure genres and this could be their rise in the shonen/battle genre. They are behind the works such as Food Wars,  Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon, A Certain Magical Index &amp; the Familiar of Zero. One might say this is perfect for Edens Zero or maybe it is exactly because Edens Zero is Being made by this very studio that there is so much fan service, although I doubt that! Either way, this is the studio to truly make Mashima’s work shine! XD<br />
<br />
Well, I believe many of us are always searching for the friends that we truly connect with.  Those who accept us for who we are and if we make a great mistake, forgive us and let us grow to become a better version of ourselves. Some may not have many friends at all and some may want more friends. Who is better to show us what&#039;s the bonds of friendship really stand for and how a true friend acts than Hiro Mashima! :D<br />
<br />
If you like Mashima’s works and have a deep love for all of his characters you will love what he stands for: Never abandon your friends! Even the fiction ones! What could possibly be better than alternative versions of Fairy Tail members returning to his new works with new design &amp; origin stories even with the same voice cast from Fairy Tail! <br />
They are here to say that you are not gonna lose them anytime soon!  :D<br />
<br />
Mashima has a very funny way of doing things and he really upped the comedic aspect of Eden Zero as well. I laughed really hard at each episode and cried even. Not everything has to be serious in the world. :D<br />
<br />
Reasons Edens Zero might not be for you and why you might hate it:<br />
<br />
You don’t like Hiro Mashima&#039;s works! <br />
<br />
You despise fanservice! (Valid point) There are lots of works without fanservice so don’t dwell on it, there is something for you out there! ;) <br />
<br />
You don’t really know what great world-building is! Nah just kidding Eden Zero isn’t clicking the way it should and that’s understandable, we can’t like them all am I right! :P ‘<br />
<br />
You don’t believe in the power of friendship, and believe it’s crap that Mahsima carried over from Fairy Tail to Edens Zero. Bullshit you totally do, you tell me you can’t get in a serious fight with a friend and forgive them afterward or be forgiven, well that’s not friendship then! :)<br />
<br />
You don’t understand what’s funny and have crappy humor and you are very boring: Yeah Mashima&#039;s humor is not for everybody. But there is probably something else that can make you laugh I hope! Even if you have Zero humor it doesn’t matter. There is plenty of serious battle anime with dark themes out there. Personally, I love comedy and also Dark stuff but different themes and, different mindsets. XD<br />
<br />
This is gonna be a long one guys read my full review if you are either one of these below!<br />
<br />
A: Bored at the moment. <br />
B: wanted to read a review and randomly stumbled upon me. :P  <br />
C: Curiosity got the best of you, what could someone possibly write 5 pages about? XD <br />
D: Just like reading reviews of random people on the internet! <br />
<br />
Hey, fellow humans. I have read a Review of Edens Zero and I just want to say that they are wasting time in writing about something they hate or view with a negative mindset and at that point quit the show will ya! <br />
<br />
Seriously never get why some people continue with something they hate or don’t like and then have to F’in tell everyone about it. That they hated the show so much and all the reasons they could find to tell just how much they hate it. Go tell your friends if you hate something and never talk about it again unless you have a conversation about it with someone in real-time.  <br />
<br />
You, dumbass! Quit wasting your own time and my time, at the same time. XD <br />
<br />
This anime itself is a different work from other anime series and not every anime can be the same. How boring is that?  and Hiro Mashima has always been writing about friendship Ever since Rave Master, which is pretty old now btw.  If you don’t like his shit then don’t watch it,  it’s that simple. <br />
<br />
That said, I am also wasting my time now! XD <br />
Simply because I don’t like the way some people are and it’s annoying that they don’t have any brain cells. Well, I don’t have that many brain cells either but these guys have even less than me! XD<br />
<br />
viewing anything with that much negativity and hate only makes it hell for you.  I don&#039;t like cheese and I have tried multiple times to see maybe It will taste differently the next time, but it doesn’t and whenever I eat any my body rejects cheese and I throw up, but I don’t go posting it on every food-related website do I or make a review of it! <br />
<br />
What one person finds funny isn’t what others will find funny. We all have different types of humor. <br />
<br />
If anyone thinks that world-building is poor then I don’t think you know how hard it can be to make something as amazing that others also have to like as well otherwise it won’t sell. <br />
One thing is to make something you only like and hope that it will resonate with others, another is to make something you like but have to make it so others like it as well and we are not talking in hundreds but million. F’ing millions of people have to like the shit that you make so that it will sell well! <br />
<br />
First of all, if you are a fiction creator/writer or a manga artist. It is not easy to do world-building. Not even after making something great. Every time one wants to make a new world amongst <br />
Millions of other fiction creators&#039; ability to world-build are tested and your fantasy is tested. Not everyone is gifted with wild fantasy! But it can be cultivated and expanded after creating and reading, watching dozens of fiction works. <br />
<br />
And Mashima’s world-building skill set is one of a kind. It is something, not just anyone can pull off.!<br />
Even if you think you can! If so then go write a book or make a manga! :P<br />
<br />
I think that Hiro Mashima has an ability to do amazing world-building and incredible fantasy on par with Eiichiro Oda and that he really upped his game since Fairy Tail.<br />
<br />
And with only 12 episodes out even the best series won’t be able to show exactly how. The power scaling is because it has only 12 episodes so far and the manga is a long-running one <br />
<br />
The character designs are not shamelessly recycled. He is an artist and that is just how his art style is. And it is quite obvious that he had a very hard time letting go of some of his characters because he simply loves them that much. The mascot of his series has always been Plue but looks like he likes Happy just much. Because someone who creates many stories and many worlds the characters aren’t just characters they are people of the world that one has built and ending it would also mean that you have to part ways to part with them.<br />
So he made a parallel version of Erza Scarlet/Elsie Crimson, Jellal/Justice, and Happy/Android Happy. Which makes them a different Character/person altogether technically. Just like McDonald&#039;s and Burger King. ‘’Sorry, it’s a shitty comparison!’’ XD <br />
<br />
Mashima is the creator and if he can’t let go of some of his characters who can blame him, that’s a very human thing to do. He is an artist and storyteller. If he wants to bring back a character for a different story then he can do it all he wants. Even if he brings a character back the world/story is still different. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think It’s a very beautiful thing to do, that he brings some of his characters with him to his new work, that way he doesn&#039;t have to say goodbye not entirely at least.<br />
Well, who knows this is just how I see things. I would love to see the mc of Rave Master Haru Glory again someday in the future if there is a chance that it can happen. Well, it’s probably not going to though but, One can hope, right? :P <br />
<br />
<br />
While there are a shit ton of Fairy Tail Easter eggs including the Fairy Tail characters popping up all over during those 12 episodes in the background. Happy, Erza, and Jellal aside that had parallels of them made kind of like that parallel world arc in Fairy Tail. XD <br />
So both Natsu and Lucy appeared in the background, including Mirajane and Lisanna that I know of so far. There could be more that I failed to spot. :p<br />
<br />
And yes of course you can find something that you like better, something that just lights your inner flame of passion for anime! However, each work of fiction has its own thing right?<br />
<br />
And Yes Mashima’s works are about fanservice and Friendship or was it the other way around. :p<br />
But let me tell you this much. If anyone has seen Bleach, One Piece, and Naruto. These 3 works of mangas were at the peak of all manga and anime at one point in time and the only one of these 3 Heavy hitters that never relied on Sexy art style or fanservice is Naruto! And even then Naruto has a bit of fanservice even though it is very, very, very minimal, so little in fact rewatching the series a few times might be the only way you will notice the fanservice at all. XD<br />
If you don’t believe me look it up <br />
<br />
While it does seem like Mashima has upped his fanservice game in Eden Zero since Fairy Tail. well at least during the 12 first episodes of Edens Zero at the very least. XD<br />
Maybe there is only a lot in the first 12 episodes and then it gets toned down a bit or maybe the fanservice is filler moment’s or there might not be fanservice at all in the manga or just a lot less fanservice. Maybe that’s something the anime studio decided to put in or maybe not! Since I don’t read the manga at the moment I don’t have all the facts about how deep this fanservice will go. But the anime hasn’t even kicked off yet considering it has just begun and how big and Rave Master and Fairy Tail was. I expect the battle arcs to have less fanservice at the very least once the manga properly kick-off. Either that or Mashima Finally embraced his pervy self XD<br />
<br />
But if you look from the start of the Fairy Tail anime to the finished product there wasn’t that much fanservice in the beginning because it wasn’t that much of a thing in a shonen battle series in the early 2000  but over time it became a thing and more and more of the readers was perverts and then it became a thing since apparently a good story in itself wasn’t enough! -.-<br />
<br />
If you absolutely hate Edens Zero while watching it’s obvious the shit will seem slow-paced as F simply because it is not being enjoyed by you F’ing pessimist! <br />
Anything viewed with negative eyes and emotion is gonna be hell to get through. Why do you think school takes forever to end? That&#039;s F’ing why! It’s annoying as hell! That&#039;s why negative peoples/pessimists&#039; judgment of anything is all hate, hate, hate, I don&#039;t like. Uga Buga. They are all cave people with no brain cells! <br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with making a review of something that you don’t like but make a proper review will ya! Say why you hate it and then maybe why others might like it, if not keep your shit opinions to yourself! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Then Again I do enjoy fanservice and I did enjoy the shit out of Eden Zero but I would still enjoy it without a single drop of fanservice. XD<br />
So yeah they could have lessened it but there is only one reason for the fanservice and that&#039;s because the target audience is a bunch of perverts!  But then again Mashima is also a big pervert so don’t watch his stuff,  if you hate fanservice :P <br />
<br />
(For the warriors who made it through the 5 pages of hell here is a personal note to make your lives better. :P <br />
There is a shit ton of anime and a shit ton of different genres. Just go watch some of those there is plenty of stuff there that will make you enjoy them, being negative and a pessimist isn’t gonna help anybody neither you nor me! <br />
Find something you enjoy more and move on there is no point in writing a review of something and only mentioning how much and why you hate it and even finding 12 reasons to hate the series. That stuff possibly can’t be healthy!) XD<br />

    Should you watch it? I&#039;ve been enjoying it so far, so I&#039;d say yeah.<br />
<br />
Story: I&#039;d say the story is decently paced. I always go back for more and can&#039;t wait to see what happens in the next episode. Many different and interesting situations happens in this show, and you can feel the emotions behind the scenarios that happen to some characters. It really makes you care for the characters, and feel their pain, happiness, or emotions in general.<br />
<br />
Art: As for the art itself it&#039;s good. But you can tell the creator just kinda reused some fairy tail characters designs, and that&#039;s alright. Some people do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411523">
        that with anime. Who know maybe there will be a mention of some characters being related to characters from Fairy Tail, like Elsie related to Erza or something lol. As for the animation like fight scenes, while it&#039;s good, it has yet to be as good as Fairy Tail, but that&#039;s understandable. Don&#039;t want to spend alot of the animation budget on just simple plot scenes. Could be saving it for later in the story.<br />
<br />
Sound: Love the First Opening, and Ending. It&#039;s going to be Nostalgic in a few years. I don&#039;t know about the 2nd one though. Maybe just need time for it to grow on me. <br />
<br />
Characters: Each character is unique. They have their own personalities, and in some ways could be seen as a rewash of the og fairy tail characters, but even then besides looks they&#039;re different in alot of ways. But of course you&#039;ll notices similarities as well.<br />
<br />
Overall: I really enjoy this series in many ways it&#039;s like fairy tail, though it has its own unique charm. It&#039;s not like the best of the best anime, but it&#039;s still really good. I&#039;d recommend it.
