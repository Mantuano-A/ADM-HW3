    What’s better than a cafe with delicious food? A cafe with cute girls to serve you of course! It gets even better. These girls have some exaggerated personalities. From sadistic to tsundere, it’s a place that really gives customers a hell of an experience. Blend S is honestly an anime that I found ridiculously fun to watch. <br />
<br />
Starting from the beginning, it shouldn’t take long for viewers to recognize that the anime has a lot of fun with itself. The selling point of show is the comedy as every main female characters’ personalities are beyond the normal norm. Honestly, I lost count how many times

        I laughed in this show because how over the top it is. From Maika’s sadism to Miu’s older sister behavior, it’s a series that really became self-aware of its intentions. Indeed, Blend S’ storytelling isn’t accomplished through its plot. Every day consist of workplace sitcoms that cleverly delivers its humor. I’m also surprised how smooth the pacing the show felt. It felt like every episode is able to connect with each other and staying true to its premise and genres. The show doesn’t need to really rely on story at all to deliver satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Of course, it’s the characters that puts value into the comedy. Here’s the thing: the female characters that work there have some deceptive personalities. Maika is one of the guiltiest examples as she displays traits of sadism in almost every episode. Early impressions of Maika can be surprising as such a sweet innocent girl that can be deceptively sadistic on paper. The words she use and way she talks to her customers become a source of recurring humor. However, be aware that it’s pretty much a parody. Maika isn’t truly malevolent and actually worries about how to treat customers better. The way she snaps back to a more apologetic personality is infectiously amusing to watch. Then, there’s Kaho Hinata, a girl that plays the role of a tsundere. In truth, she’s not a tsundere although the anime really try to get her over as one. Mafuyu Hoshikawa brings in a feel of innocence because of her appearance although in truth, her age is older than she appears to be. In fact, she is one of the more mature characters in the show. This trio is mainly the core of the series that are able to capitalize their personality to astonishing levels.<br />
<br />
There are also some other characters that are worth taking notice too. This includes the inspiring idol trap Hideri Kanzaki and the older sister role model, Miu. Although not featured as prominently as the core characters, they still bring it a lot of personality. Through character chemistry, they bring a handful amount of colorful moments to the show that can be deceptively fun to watch. On the other hand, I can’t really say the guys in this anime are memorable. Dino and Koyou are the only two main guys although their role is portrayed more as side characters. They only shine best through character interactions with others (especially Maika and Dino) rather than by themselves. In fact, Dino is portrayed more as a butt monkey that no one can take seriously. This anime also does a fair amount of ship teasing between the cast although nothing really gets serious. Remember, it’s a show that make fun of the working environment. Working at a cafe is mostly seen as part of the blue collar occupation category yet this anime is able to bring the fun out of that. Also do note that the series does occasionally go beyond their restaurant such as the outdoors and even the beach. <br />
<br />
As a comedy-slice of life, I think Blend S simply did the best with what it had to work with. Some viewers will point fingers at the dead plot or repetitive jokes. However, I confess that it always feels refreshing to see a show like this step up to the plate. I’ve only read parts of the manga but to say the least, the anime captures the overall mood of the anime accurately and consistent with the character personalities. The way it expresses them is what really gives this show its meaningful value. <br />
<br />
I was surprised that A-1 Pictures were announced to be adapting this anime. It didn’t really fit with their style but thankfully, they manage to pull it off. For starters, Café Stile has a surprisingly amount of realism. If you ever walked into a café, then you would expect it to look something very similar to the one in this show. Then, there are the character designs. The waitresses in the show wear their work outfits with certain colors. It’s adorably charming and very fitting for a show especially since the waitresses are the main attraction. Character traits are also evident such as Maika’s height (and occasional ponytail hairstyle), Miu’s oneesama face, Kaho’s signature twin tails, or Hideri’s deceptive look. However, the biggest selling point of the visual style is the character expressions. It reflects the false personalities of the characters as parodies and works in wonder. Maika’s “sadistic” smirk and Kaho’s tsundere reactions are just a few examples. To say the least, A-1 Pictures convince me that they can handle a show like Blend S. Oh and there is some fan service but rather than adapting it in some alluring way, it’s used to portray the credibility of the setting.<br />
<br />
Oh boy, the OP song. “Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise, Service” became a meme that went over. You can look up the song on Youtube or some popular video streaming site and see many parodies of it. Those words reflect the fake identity and personalities of the characters. Beyond that, I am also somewhat impressed by the character voices in this show. Maika in particular is noticeable for her ability to shift her tone of voice through certain frames. Miu’s oneesama voice gives off a mixture of mature and sexy vibe that is hard to ignore. Finally, there’s Hideri…and the character is really able to surprise you because of the voice.<br />
<br />
Blend S is hardly blend but instead takes great care of its characters. Through their personalities, they are able to sell the show’s immense amount of humor to viewers. Playing as characters that go against stereotypical archetypes isn’t easy but to me, Blend S really worked itself to accomplish that. <br />

    Smile. Sweet. Sister. Sadistic. Surprise. Service. We are Stile!<br />
<br />
Blend S is already one of my favourite SOL anime of all time due to its amazing characters, beautiful art and awesome soundtrack. <br />
<br />
The story first revolves around Maika and how she can&#039;t get a job due to her unnatural scary look. She comes across this cafe, but not just any cafe, this is a cafe out of the ordinary. Luckily for Maika, her unnatural scary look might come in handy. This cafe takes certain archetypes of characters and apply them to our main characters. <br />
<br />
Maika is supposed to act like the Sadist in the Cafe, in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261922">
        this case, she can easily succeed in doing so without knowing it. Our beautiful character Kaho (Yunno, the one with huge boobs) is in charge of being the Tsundere. Hoshikawa has the Imouto role, Miu with the Older Sister role, and Hideki with the idol role. <br />
<br />
Seeing these types of characters in one single place working, you can see why I treasure this series. It&#039;s super funny and super adorable, and the opening is starting to become a meme.<br />
<br />
The story so far isn&#039;t too plot heavy ofc since it is an SOL series. However, it does kinda focus on Maika and her life at the Cafe and how she improves her Sadist character. While she does that there seems to be a click between her and the Manager. The manager is 26 and Maika is 16. So it&#039;s not like that can&#039;t work, I mean, a ten year difference??? Idk tho actually lol. They might fit some sort of romantic situation between the two, which is A Ok for me. <br />
<br />
Overall this series is super fun and the opening is amazing. This is recommended for anyone who enjoys workplace animes with amazing characters, fun interactions, and great comedy. You should watch this last after watching some heavy anime this fall. It would be a good way to end a nice Saturday. :)<br />

    Sometimes it just takes and endearing cast and fun situations to make me Smile. Blend S doesn’t boast an intricate plot with elaborate detail and it quite frankly doesn’t need one to be successful. This is a very Sweet anime that managed to be enjoyable and consistently entertaining, which was honestly a Surprise to me since I didn&#039;t really have any expectations coming into this anime. Maika with her unintentionally Sadistic looks ended up being my favorite part of the show, though this doesn’t mean that she overshadowed the rest of the cast, who all managed to stand out in their own ways. Even the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266246">
        really minor characters, like Maika’s Sister, had their moments. Overall, I’d have to say that A-1 pictures did a fine Service to the anime industry by releasing this show.<br />
<br />
The basic premise of the show is that a high school girl named Maika wants to get a job so she can pay for the expenses to study abroad. There’s just one problem; nobody wants to hire her because she has a naturally nasty look in her eyes. Feeling dejected, Maika’s fortune changes for the better when the Italian manager of Cafe Stile, Dino, hires her because she’d be perfect at playing a sadistic waitress in his restaurant. His strong penchant for dark haired Japanese girls also played a part in his hiring of Maika. Long story short, Maika finds success at her job and formulates strong friendships with her coworkers.<br />
<br />
Basically, each episode showcases different scenarios in which the characters end up in comedic situations. Now these types of shows can either be hits or misses. It ultimately depends on the quality of the characters and the jokes. Fortunately for Blend S, it got both departments right. Let’s briefly analyze the prominent characters to see why they positively contribute to the success of the show.<br />
<br />
Maika is the protagonist, and she really is a gentle and innocent girl. She wants to make customers smile and always tries to do her best. Though thanks to her menacing glare and awkwardness, she oftentimes ends up being a picture perfect sadist, much to her chagrin. Though its her unintentional tendency to act like a sadist that makes me and the customers at Cafe Stile adore her so. I was afraid that the emphasis on her vicious glare would end up getting old, but it actually didn’t. It was used in many different scenarios throughout the anime’s runtime that kept the humor revolving around it fresh and fun. Though she’s great on her own, what really makes her shine is her chemistry with the other characters, specifically Dino.<br />
<br />
Dino is the manager of Cafe Stile, and its very clear that he is a masochist (and a pervert in the eyes of his employees). He has a one sided love for Maika and has nosebleeds whenever she does something remotely cute. He’s actually one of the better male leads that I’ve seen in recent memory, because while many act too serious to be entertaining characters, Dino’s silliness makes him very fun to watch. Whether it be happily getting stepped on by Maika or failing to get his feelings across to her, Dino never failed to bring a smile to my face whenever he appeared on screen.<br />
<br />
Kaho acts as the tsundere at the cafe, though in reality she would be better described as a game addicted shut in. She’s a nice character, though I personally like her best when she interacts with Akizuki, the chef at the cafe. He’s also a recluse and has no experience with women, so his interactions with Kaho usually end up being both cute and comical. Mafuyu is the final original cast member and is the little sister at the cafe. When she works, she puts on a smile that could melt even the coldest of hearts and acts like a loving, bubbly imouto. However, she really is a 20 year old college student who rarely shows emotion. Its an amusing contrast, and since I’m a fan of both of her personality types, I ended up really liking her character. <br />
<br />
The other two characters worth giving a shoutout to are Miu and Hideri, who start working at the cafe in the latter portion of the anime. Miu is a dōjinshi artist and a pervert while Hideri is…well, lets just say that Hideri is the “surprise.” Now all of these characters are decent on their own, but  when blended together, they really stand out. They just compliment each other remarkably well, which makes for an enjoyable viewing experience. <br />
<br />
Blend S was refreshing. Many anime that I’ve seen recently have tried to construct an intricate story filled to the brim with “epic” plot twists and the like. While some succeed, many more ultimately fail, and watching them ends up becoming more of a chore than a pleasant viewing experience. With Blend S, I was able to relax and just enjoy some light hearted comedy, which can honestly be all that’s needed to make a show great. Blend S is by no means spectacular, but it&#039;s a nice show to watch if you just want to see some lighthearted fun.

    A-1 Pictures is back at it again with yet another adaptation that caters to the lowest common denominator. It&#039;s like they don&#039;t even try to hide it anymore. <br />
<br />
I originally started watching this solely because I&#039;ve been craving some good old CGDQT, and found out Sora Tokui was in the cast, so it seemed like a no brainer to give it a shot. I&#039;m glad I did, now I can move on - shame that I didn&#039;t get to see her character in action.<br />
<br />
This is supposed to be a comedy. I&#039;m sorry but I do not find excessive shouting to be hilarious, otherwise I would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264203">
        be watching Black Clover. I find characters like Dino to be the most annoying pieces of work one can come across when watching anime. Other than that, despite having very few moments where one may smirk, the comedy as a whole falls horribly flat. Turns out relying on cringy otaku humor gets old after a while. Yes I get it, he stays up watching anime until it&#039;s late, and she likes going to the arcade, yes she has a mean glare and utters words that happen to luckily fit the &#039;sadistic&#039; shtick. It&#039;s cool. Don&#039;t get me wrong though, it can work with proper timing, better characters and a better straight man / tsukkomi, but that doesn&#039;t happen in here.<br />
<br />
This is supposed to be a slice of life. I cannot think of a single interaction in this show that was realistic. Not one. From the way they hire people, to the way the characters behave and react to pretty much anything. Yes I know there are actual weeb cafes in real life, but I&#039;m not talking about that. Nosebleeds, violence, manager getting yelled at by everyone, clients receiving garbage food and treatment yet enjoying it, sleeping in ones lap, manager passing out all over the place and people sitting / stomping on him, having dates and giving presents after knowing each other like a month at most. It all adds up until it kills any suspension of disbelief, something that is quite an achievement considering this is just a non-serious slice of life show, it still manages to do it. Congratulations Blend-S, you&#039;ve done the impossible.<br />
<br />
Characters are tropes, that&#039;s fine. They&#039;re alright for the most part. Maika is the &#039;normie&#039; and her sadistic trope gets overplayed to extremes in just 5 episodes. Kaho likes online games. Mafuyu is a deadpan loli with the classic &#039;looks 10 but is actually much older&#039; character &quot;trait&quot;, she likes mahou shoujo. Miu(?) writes doujins. The green haired guy is probably the most bearable of all the characters. There isn&#039;t much to say about Dino. I didn&#039;t like Ouran High, and he reminds me a lot of the main blonde dude in there, who I also didn&#039;t like one bit. Seems petty, but I honestly find that kind of &quot;humor&quot; very annoying. <br />
<br />
Most of the times it will be:<br />
<br />
1. Female character (mostly Maika) does something.<br />
2. Dino gets swoon in moeness from it, proceeds to do something weird.<br />
3. Insert any of the other characters playing a rather poor tsukkomi role.<br />
<br />
It really gets tiring.<br />
<br />
Art is great as usual, A-1 pictures pays extra attention in making the characters have their conversations in the dressing room. I&#039;m no SJW so I don&#039;t care if they show skin, but damn, I do hate getting treated like those are the things that are supposed to get me to watch these shows in the first place. It&#039;s jarring and insulting. Add the usual jiggly physics, sexy costumes and interesting camera angles, and you have an A-1 pictures anime! Even if it doesn&#039;t fit the theme at all, they&#039;ll feed it to you, forcefully.<br />
<br />
Sound, OP and ED are... ok. I like how the ED seems to be updating as more characters are introduced. Voice acting, it shows that Maika&#039;s VA is pretty much a newbie. Much like Dino, she&#039;s always almost-shouting, and her delivery seems very inconsistent. I&#039;m no VA expert, but that much I could tell at least. Other characters are alright.<br />
<br />
I bought into the hype, guys. I thought this was gonna be an interesting ride but boy was I mistaken. To be quite frank, the humor present in many of the shows that I actually enjoyed mostly wasn&#039;t laugh-out-loud worthy, but at least it was bearable even at the times where the jokes fell short. Why? because the characters actually carried those shows. I don&#039;t recommend watching this, even if you&#039;re a Sora Tokui fan. <br />
<br />

    One word. Pedophille. Can anyone even have common sense? 10 years difference in age, like what the fuck? Honestly tried so hard to get though a ep and managed to get by because of the other characters and now where I&#039;m at, theres a whole ep for this shitty 10 years difference pedo ship. Imagine a 26 year old getting a boner at a 16 year old, wouldn&#039;t that be creepy as fuck? Well that is what is happening is this perfectly good moe anime that would of made me finish it if it wasn&#039;t for the pedo guy. Dropped it.

    Really, what a gem. This show has truly been doing its best out of what a cute-girls-4koma adaption could possibly do in every aspect.<br />
<br />
Before I dig deeper, let me share some fun I found on Blend S&#039;s official website first. This thing - The Maika&#039;s Maika-lendar - has somehow become my daily motivation xD<br />
<br />
http://blend-s.jp/cp/calendar/<br />
<br />
STORY = 7/10. This is a little more than your typical cute-girls slice-of-life. It has good comedy with a touch of romance, along with interesting character motives and backstory. I especially like how they handled the comedy. We have the main girl, clueless and innocent, with her expressive vs. natural character problem.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261924">
        Other girls and guys with their own switches to flip. All that contrast created a minefield full of misunderstandings and gags. <br />
<br />
ART = 7/10. A bright and fluffy-feeling colour pallette. Cute but somehow cliched character designs. Nothing special, really. You might&#039;ve seen this style all over the place already, but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s bad. The animating is slightly well done imo. In addition, at times you&#039;ll be rewarded with Aiura-tier thighs. Oh how I wanna bury my face in them.<br />
<br />
SOUND = 8/10. Character&#039;s voices suit them so well it hurts. Well there&#039;s this cast full of rising stars as well as skillful famous veterans afterall. So far soundtrack doesn&#039;t really have much impact. However they have really good OP/ED songs. Personally I think Blend S&#039;s OP is the second best this season (after Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryoko&#039;s).<br />
<br />
CHARACTER = 9/10. The best part about this anime. Foremost, cute girls equipped with well-portraited characteristics and resonable amount of moe (this is important). Second, the guys. I mean, actually funny and interesting guys among cute girls? A rare sight. These guys should be put under national protection. They&#039;re all somewhat special because each one has not only one, but two &quot;attributes&quot; to their characteristics. Moreover, almost every character is an otaku to some points. Not creepy (like me for example), but enthusiastic and lovely otakus. It&#039;d be way too easy to simpathize with them if you&#039;ve had a bit of knowledge about anime/manga/doujin industry.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT = 9/10. Yes, I might have favoured this show a bit since I&#039;m a fan of CGDCT and slice-of-life. But I think Blend S is good both in its own genre as well as in general. It should be easy to tell from the recommendations section, that if you&#039;ve enjoyed Working!&#039;s comedic story telling and unique characters or GochiUsa&#039;s relaxing vibe and gorgeus artwork, then Blend S would much likely be your cup of tea. And also, cameos await.<br />
<br />
Well yes, I did enjoy this anime very much. I did admit that Maika-lendar has become my daily motivation. But it&#039;s not like something inside me has been awakened or anything. I certainly feel nothing over having Maika-sama steps on my face, or glares upon me disgustingly as if she were looking at a squished cockcroach. Being honest here. Trust me.

    There are six words starting with &quot;S&quot; you should remember, plus another word starting with &quot;S&quot; you have to add to make it an internet pride. <br />
&quot;Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise, Service&quot; -  these are the holy words that starts with &quot;S&quot; that summarizes the whole anime itself. I was wondering why its called &quot;Blend S&quot;.... Now when I finished it, my first guess was correct (though this is my opinion only).  A mix of attributes of the characters. Words that starts with &quot;S&quot; that characters are assigned to.  Blend S is an anime this Fall 2017 that offers us a cafe

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266131">
        that have the employees acting like anime characters. Though this cafe is not an ordinary cafe you always go to like Starbucks or Costa Coffee. The cafe is called &quot;Cafe Stile&quot;, owned by an Italian manager. A crazy one. The staff composes of 5 girls and 2 boys (4 girls and 3 boys specifically when you watched it). Maika, the clumsy employee who smile in a sadist way, which makes the people keep on going in there (along with the manager liking her so much).<br />
Kaho, the gamer who blushes to customers... Basically she&#039;s a tsundere...<br />
Mafuyu, the most smallest one, though the most mature one in concept. Although on service, she is the &quot;imouto&quot; type (little sister). Well she is technically a dangerous loli. Miu, a doujinshi author who.. writes those stuffs and have imagination like those. She is the &quot;Onee-san&quot; type (big-sister) who always seduce the customers (not in a bad way though). Hideri, the &quot;suprise&quot; character from the six words. She is the &quot;idol&quot; type who always wants to step on stage to reveal her cuteness (i dont know if I should put &quot;she&quot; or &quot;he&quot; on this person). Then comes the boys which are Dino, the manager and Kouyou, the shut-in gamer but the one who always helps Dino.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story follows Maika, who recently got employed in a cafe. A weird cafe. That is the starting of the story of Blend S. We were shown that Maika will be one of the main focus on the plot and as the episode goes the story revolves not only to Maika but the other staff of Cafe Stile as well.<br />
With all of them getting screentime on almost every episode, it is reassuring that all of them have important roles to the progression of the plot up to the ending. I&#039;m going to tell you this. Blend S&#039; focus (On my opinion) of the story or product of it is quite difficult to understand. Summarizing it is possible but not quite easy as each episode is like this episode happens on the other day while this happened on that day etc etc. Or should I say in safer side, the story goes in random places though there are a linkage on some episode... Although I can see as a random anime full of colors, there is one obvious good thing that this anime offers. We see this thing on every characters especially the main girls of the series. They have different traits, though this trait doesnt really show them what they are at homes, school or online. Right.. This girls offers us that a person can be sweet, loving or a tsundere but only on the outside. What matters most is on the inside. We have seen characters revealing there<br />
true identity behind doors of the cafe. They always have hidden things lying in the hearts of them and this things should never be taken light of outside. It is with their own privacy although all of them seems fine showing it to other staff members (as I guess they are friends). Although this inside traits cannot be fulfilled on strangers. Why? The answer is work itself.<br />
Many people tend to have different personalities either they are at school, work and especially at home. Everyone wears a mask outside and pulls it out at home. All of us have unique personalities that not even our parents know about. It is a matter of being human. It&#039;s life. Here on this anime we saw the struggles of Maika of how can she express her natural emotions to be appealing to customer. Turns out her sadistic side is very pleasable to the folks of the cafe as well as the other characters. Each one have secrets that they do not reveal often to strangers but to those only for their friends. Those who can trust him/her. For example, it is stated in an episode with Mafuyu (when someone asked Mafuyu to go on a date) that no one will like her if the customer will know the truth. People like her for having a childish personality, though she is sure that no one will like her if she shows her true attitude. Blend S gives us a trip to a happy, cheerful and joyful anime, though have some hidden values regarding their own personal roles.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
There are limited characters here on the story. You can count the characters by your fingers I bet, though this gives this anime an advantage. English teachers will always say that when writing a story, the fewer the characters, the easy and good the story will be. Though the characters of Blend S are not few or not more (its in between), this gives the author as well as the director a good screentime for every character. Come up with a good situation that the character will participate then finish. I already explained the main ones though there are still some like &#039;Owner&#039; (the dog) and Maika&#039;s brother and sister. There is really not much of an importance to this characters but there is one. It gives information to the characters involved with it. Sure the dog is for Maika and Dino and Maika&#039;s brother and sister is for Maika. What about the others? Well, simple. Others will share. For example, Kaho behind the scenes is a shut-in gamer. This attitude applies to Kouyou also so both of them have sharing traits. Miu writes doujins so she knows those things. There is an episode when Kouyou stopped her to say a word that doesnt know the meaning by the other characters so they share personlities as well. Mafuyu&#039;s scene with Kaho having study sessions also shows that Mafuyu has an attitude of a mother then Hideri being the idol is very obvious that she wants to stand out more. Finally there&#039;s Dino, whom we all know the personality because of his persevarance and so much love sick to Maika.  All of the are on phase and makes the anime watchable.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
There&#039;s nothing really to talk about with the art here. I can describe the art like a white light going into a triangular glass prism then divides into different colors. Thus, the art is like painting. Lots of colors though its rather simple. Its appeal to the audience is fine and pleasant.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
You know the opening is already good when it turns into something that the people of the internet will be happy on. The ending is quite unique as it features chibi characters which is cute and nice on my perspective.<br />
<br />
Overall thoughts and Enjoyment:<br />
I am not a fan of this type of anime out there, though I have to be honest that I enjoyed watching it. We encountered different traits of the characters reflecting different anime personalities, as well as their hidden personalities relating to our real life attitude at work, school or at home.<br />
Therefore, I recommend you to watch it as its score for me is decent. Being simple or decent is quite beautiful you know.

    *insert original &quot;S&quot; joke*<br />
<br />
Blend S is A-1&#039;s attempt at making Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu Ka?, and it&#039;s a fair attempt, that falls short because of the bland unlikable characters, unlike the characters of GochiUsa. I had high hopes for Blend S, I thought it would be the first A-1 show that I actually like, but sadly, I was wrong.<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
<br />
What story? Do you really think A-1 would try to compliment this show with an overarching story like the one in New Game? A story in a Slice of Life CGDCT show is something that can make said show even better, because the events happening compliment

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266351">
        each other instead of being random one-shot episodes. Blend S does not have a story. It tried to, with various character introductions that come later on in the show and the last &quot;&quot;&quot;confession&quot;&quot;&quot; episode, but it fails at doing so.<br />
<br />
Basically, Blend S goes as following: Character introduction&gt;episode dedicated to the character&gt;random episode&gt;character introduction&gt;rinse repeat. This would be fine if the characters in the show were actually charismatic and fun, which they are not, something I&#039;ll address in the Character section.<br />
<br />
The humor in Blend S relies mainly on visual gags. It&#039;s the typical humor you&#039;d expect from a CGDCT show. It&#039;s boring, unoriginal, and didn&#039;t make me laugh a single time. Although, I wasn&#039;t really expecting high comedic value out of a show like this.<br />
<br />
All in all, Blend S presents episodic stories that could only be interesting or fun to watch to the crowd that enjoyed Gabriel Dropout earlier this year.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
<br />
For once A-1 do not have a noticeable animation drop in their show. The art style is similar to the one in Eromanga-sensei. It&#039;s simple and &quot;gets the job done&quot;, after all, I wouldn&#039;t be expecting a memorable art style from a CGDCT A-1 show.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
<br />
The opening is catchy, especially since the &quot;Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise&quot; sequence made itself into a meme. What this shows suffers on is the unremarkable voice acting. Aside from Hideri who is voiced by the one and only Tokui Sora (Nico Yazawa&#039;s voice actor), who did an amazing job at her role of sounding like a girl and a boy at the same time, the rest of the cast is quite bland and doesn&#039;t really stand out.<br />
<br />
Character: 2/10<br />
<br />
Good thing that Kaho exists, because dear lord the rest of the cast was painful to watch. The cast would be fine if this show were a short, because the characters wouldn&#039;t get boring by episode 6, but the same cannot be said for a full 12 episode show. As you&#039;d expect from the premise of the show, every character is reduced to 1 or 2 traits. These traits are kept as they are since episode 1, and get little to no development. If every character was introduced in episode 1, you could literally watch every episode in the order you liked. Worst part, is that one of my favourite character types, the onee-san, ended up being sidelined, and thus, being bland.<br />
<br />
The problem here is the untapped potential of the situation the characters are being put into. Personally, watching Blend S, I expected that at some moment the theme of &quot;faking character&quot; was to be brought up, you know, &quot;Forgetting their own personality because they have to fake one for the job they have to do&quot;. This theme would make for some interesting character interactions and/or development, but apparently this was too much effort for the scriptwriters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/10<br />
<br />
I gradually started watching this show just for the moments with Akizuki and Kaho. Since the show is way too centered around Maika than it should be, if you do not like Maika, you won&#039;t enjoy the show.<br />
<br />
Overall: 3/10<br />
<br />
Blend S should truly just be called &quot;Bland S&quot;<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re part of the crowd that enjoys shows with zero character development and no plot like Gabriel Dropout, go ahead and watch Blend S, as you&#039;d surely enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend Blend S?<br />
<br />
Just go watch GochiUsa.

    This is going to be a very short review. Basically, if you like moe, maids and funny characters, I&#039;d really recommend it. Love the humour and the character interactions. The mc is a little bit annoying for my taste, but nothing major. If you want to watch a funny slice of life with moe girls, this is a very good anime. The characters are very different and I&#039;m very excited to see the character voiced by Soramaru (by the time I&#039;m writing this there are only four episodes out). <br />
In conclusion, this is one of my favourite anime of this season and I&#039;d really recommend

    Oh... my God.<br />
<br />
Yet another one in the chain of weakest fucking links, Blend S successfully manages in bringing absolutely nothing of any values a media can have, be it funny, entertaining, silly, profane or profound, to the proverbial table of ANIMU, and I suppose no one would truly wish to waste their time in seeing what made this anime such a popular treat in the, ahm, &quot;community&quot; by watching more than necessary. <br />
<br />
I had hoped in vain that there was a reason more than the opening itself that made this anime into such a meme but I guess it all simply revolved around the titular

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272096">
        letter S. That being said, nothing but the opening itself seems to have any value, since it spammed so many entertaining memes that it renders the anime itself worthless in terms of how much you&#039;ll &#039;enjoy&#039; it.<br />
<br />
Dull, stereotyped characters. <br />
<br />
Absolutely abhorrent voice acting. <br />
<br />
Absolutely no &quot;lolz&quot;.<br />
<br />
Creepy &#039;romance&#039;. (of questionable romantic intentions)<br />
<br />
Slice of life disappointment.

    Blend S is definitely that guilty pleasure that you don&#039;t tell your friends about. The story is meh, the characters are pretty simple, and it&#039;s not doing anything groundbreaking, but it&#039;s definitely a show you can sit down, turn off your brain, and get more than a few laughs from it.<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
This is a slice-of-life, moe anime so as you might expect there&#039;s not much of a story line. The premise itself caters to your heavy anime watcher so it&#039;s not something you would recommend to someone getting introduced to anime. Maika Sakuranomiya is a girl trying to find a job to raise money in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344815">
        order to travel abroad, but having no luck due to her scary glare. However, Dino, the owner of a cafe that contains waitresses with different personalities (i.e. tsundere, imouto, etc) scouts her out as his &quot;sadistic&quot; girl. This does sound a little creepy considering Dino is an older Italian man with a weird black hair fetish and Maika is a high school girl, but nothing really happens. I will admit an anime covering this premise itself sounds interesting but also very cringe at the same time. However, I decided to give it a try due to the iconic opening/meme, &quot;smile, sweet, sadistic..&quot; and did not regret the decision.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
Personally I enjoyed the art style a lot. It&#039;s definitely more to the moe end, but all the characters have unique designs that makes them stand out. I also haven&#039;t seen the little fuzzballs used on Maika&#039;s hair in anime before so that was definitely a nice change up. Also, I loved the art style for Maika&#039;s sadistic faces. Even if it got repetitive, I found it hilarious every time.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
For me, the OP and ED are the main things I listen to for sound in addition to the voice actors. The main way I measure how good an OP and ED is depends on how many times I skipped them and I can gladly say that I did not skip Blend S&#039;s OP or ED once. I&#039;m sure if you&#039;re familiar with even a little of internet culture, then you&#039;ll know the iconic beginning of the opening. There&#039;s a reason it became viral because it&#039;s soooo catchy. The rest of opening is pretty solid as well. I definitely will have nostalgia when hearing it in the future and the animation that goes with the opening is great. The ED isn&#039;t as good as the OP, but the little animation that they had going on kept me every time as it shows Maika traveling and meeting all the characters and evolves as the show goes on and she meets new characters (which I love). The voice actors are pretty solid. None of them stood out exceptionally to me, but they were able to express themselves well.<br />
<br />
Character: 6<br />
The characters by themselves are pretty 1-dimensional. Dino is middle aged man in love with a high school girl, which seems to be his main personality trait. Maika is a timid, clumsy girl who tries her best to be nice and give good service but that only ends up making her even more sadistic, playing into her role. Kaho is a gamer girl who plays a tsundere in the cafe. Akizuki is probably the self-insert character as he is also a gamer and seems to have a thing going with Kaho. Miu is forgettable. Mafuyu plays the imouto (younger sister), but is ironically older than both Kaho and Maika. She is the &quot;straight woman&quot; for Dino. Hideri is an idol who comes later. <br />
<br />
I would say the main strength is how the characters interact with each other, which often lead to comedic situations. I will mention there are even interactions shown between the members without Maika, which I liked as it makes them seem like their whole personality and life is not dependent on the MC (something that I feel is way too common in anime). I wasn&#039;t a big fan of the Hideri-Miu interaction, but I loved the Kaho-Mufuyu one and thought that added a lot of depth to both characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
I would definitely classify Blend S as a &quot;guilty pleasure.&quot; It&#039;s that cute anime that you watch but don&#039;t talk about with other people since it&#039;s also kind of cringe. The characters were a lot of fun to watch for me and watching Maika try so hard to only end up scaring the customers even more with her sadistic look was entertaining.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
Blend S is not something that I would recommend as an anime you should see before you die, but it&#039;s definitely a show that can help you relax if you&#039;ve had a tough day or are looking for a short show to binge in between the intense 100 episode action anime you just finished and the next one you&#039;re about to start. It&#039;s funny, the characters are likable, and the OP and ED are solid.

    MINOR SPOILER ALERT<br />
<br />
Blend S is just another slice of life anime. There’s nothing that really stands out. It was pretty fun to watch in the beginning and I really enjoyed it. Enough to give it an 8.<br />
<br />
Though after the fifth episode I was mostly forcing myself to get through it since I only had about half of the episodes left. Every episode after number five was pretty boring and felt like it took forever to finish.<br />
<br />
It didn’t have a great plot or story and just took a maid cafe and tried to change it so that it would seem different. The plot can be summed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review372370">
        up as a bunch of cute girls working at a cafe. I didn’t really realize that it was a comedy until I looked at the genre. The jokes were bland and didn’t make me laugh. An example of an anime with great jokes that made laugh is Hataraku Maou-sama. I was just bored and it was too slow paced for my liking. This is coming from a person that has watched every filler in Naruto and thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
The art and soundtrack didn’t differentiate itself either. The art style was generic and nothing out of the ordinary. Just what you would see in a stereotypical slice of life anime. Although I really did like the illustration they showed at the end of the last episode. The soundtrack had one good song and that was the opening. It’s really catchy and a great template for memes. The rest of the music wasn’t bad but wasn’t good. They fit in with the context of the scene and that’s about it.<br />
<br />
The characters were mostly just a bunch of tropes but that’s all there was for most of the characters. Ouran high school host club is a good example of a show that does their characters good. Though they are based on tropes there’s more to them an they’re all unique in their own way. Maika was a bit too dense for me and reminded me of Kirito. Mafuyu was just a short, aloof kuudere. I liked Kaho’s character the best because she had quite a few traits but she wasn’t the best either. She was like a reliable older sister that enjoyed video games and isn’t too good at school. Amano is just a hentai artist. Kanzaki is just a femboy. Dino is just an otaku that likes Maika and I still don’t know much about Akizuki except for that he’s into yuri and cute girls. The last four characters didn’t have much of a personality and are just there. The character designs were also pretty bland although I really liked Kaho’s design. The characters weren’t too memorable and I only remembered two of their names. Overall there isn’t really anything special about the cast but there also isn’t really anything to point out as a horrible trait.<br />
<br />
That’s pretty much all I have to say and I wouldn’t recommend this show but it mostly just depends on what type anime you enjoy. I really like slice of life but I wasn’t  too fond of this particular anime. This show wasn’t too great but it’s not like I hate it but I do think it’s a bit overrated. You are free to like whatever you want. I respect your opinion either way but I stand by mine.

    A1 Picture is back at it again, with lowest common denominator entertainment…. but I kind of enjoyed it this time. Blend S is not a good show that explores the human psyche but it neither is an insultingly bad show or one that is boring. I think the main Issue is that the show isn’t really capturing the zeitgeist of slice of life and decided to be kind of dull. Slice of Life anime’s are about growth and character interaction. This show is completely one note in that regard. None of them felt like they grown as a character or have that much of an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266278">
        interesting dynamic in the end, which really hinders the show immensely. Of course this isn’t to say that all slice of life should be about growth theres plenty out there that is good that isn’t “Mangaka and His Assistant”, “D-Frag” or “Oshiete Galko-Chan” are prime examples of that. But those shows are far funnier and had some interesting dynamics in the show that kept it above from the rest.<br />
<br />
Blend S is an anime based on the manga of the same name. The show is similar to Working and Is This Order a Rabbit, where it is mostly work slice of life that takes place in a café/restaurant. The show centres around Maika a High School girl, who got a job in a “wacky maid café” where all the girls plays an anime quirk whetter it’s tsundere, little sister, or an Idol.  Which is an interesting concept and they even played with it being that the jokes centre in their clashing personality of each of the character and the quirk they play. Kaho is a sweet heart who has to play a tsundere, Mafuyu is a stone faced mature 20 year old who has to play a little sister etc etc. This is all fine and good but though I chuckle and even laugh once or twice, a level of growth or anything interesting done with it. The jokes in the end were just “ HAHAHA KAHO HAS TITS” or “HAHAHAHAH MAFUYU IS A LOLI”. Which plays in the biggest issue this show has the show lacked so much personality. Though I think the characters are fine, I feel a majority is kind of one note the exception being Mafuyu and Maika.  The are a lot of wasted potential here an example would be Kaho and Akizuki, who are shown to have somewhat an on screen romance, but it never went anywhere. Akizuki is a fish eyed weeb whos awkward around women and Kaho is a cheerful beautiful weeb who spends all of her time playing games but is also a massive scaredy cat. They did play with it here and there. But they were forgettable, and the dialogue they share wasn’t interesting. It wasn’t, as funny and intelligent like in Lucky Star where the dialogue felt like satire or as memorable and cutthroat like in Bakemonogatari. Overall it just felt dull. The main character though not completely one note didn’t really grow on me, she was the most boring character I the fray. As her arch of wanting to learn about other culture was barely mentioned and her romance with the manager Dino which had some pretty funny moments such as when Dino was arrested for when he got to close to Maika. Felt manufactured, its your typical “Oh he’s in love with me…. Oh I’m tooo dense to notice hahahah tehehe~” It was disappointing to say the least. The show could have benefited greatly if it stopped emulating popular tropes and instead playing around with it. The beach episode was one of the worst beach episodes; it was just dull and insultingly boring, the side characters were also a huge let down. To the shows credit however, I want bored at least not all the time. Most of the time I feel the show had a little bit charm into it, its dull and repetitive with them repeating the same joke just with a little variety. But part of it has grown on me and some episodes aren’t as bad as the others. I like the part where Mafuyu talks about relationship and her interaction with the cast. I think Kaho and Akizuki though I’ve mention to be kind off dull. I think has some potential into it.<br />
<br />
Animation wise, its pretty, A1 picture the cancer of the studio they are can make some good visuals, though not very interesting it’s at least pleasing to the eyes. I particularly like how they animate Mafuyu and Hideri. Character design wise ill give them prop a majority of them I do like. Mafuyu, Maika and Kaho are pretty design though a little uninspired they have interesting facial expressions and overall I find kind of a good blend (Pun not intended) of interesting design choices. Note Kaho is like incredibly hot and Mafuyu is like incredibly cute while Maika is kind of a sweet spot design where it just kind of works.<br />
<br />
Music wise its……. serviceable no pun intended. Though its not all over the place like some other A1 shows, it’s definitely not catchy or memorable. It goes for the OP and E. D was kind of disappointed I expected better. Voice acting is pretty good; it features a lot of newcomers, though I do feel the Seiyou for Akizauki and Miu can pretty bad. With Miu a lot of the times I kind of wished she more of memorable voiced, but in the end it felt so boring and even when she’s being a perv she doesn’t really do much with her vocal range. With Akizuki it was ok but anyone could have played this role. If this anime’s goal was to build new seiyou stars, then it failed. None but a few of the cast really showed their range or show how unique their voice. I think the show could have benefited from having Veteran seiyous on the show voicing the supporting characters. <br />
<br />
Is it a bad show definitely not there’s moments that I genuinely laugh or even chuckle a little. There’s no one particularly annoying or even insultingly bad. The show is not great or even good. But its definitely not a bad time waster or a good laugh or even an introduction to slice of life that isn’t too slow….. Just don’t expect to come out of it completely satisfied. The show was too busy emulating what was popular it never became it’s own thing and if it wasn’t for the Meme it spawned I don’t think anyone would bat an eye watching it. I came in the show with low expectation and I wasn’t blown away but I wasn’t horrified with what I find. Overall it’s ok; personally check out the show I mention in the first paragraph instead, but if you find the show entertaining I get it, the wacky and warm setting is still welcomed but in the sea of anime this is one that isn’t special or anything. I’m feeling a decent 5 to a Hard 5 on this.<br />

    I honestly wasn&#039;t expecting much out of Blend S. I was expecting this to be, yet another, cute and clique coffee based anime. After jumping on Crunchyroll, I decided to give Blend a chance. It surprised me with the amount of comedy it presented. If you&#039;ve been looking for an anime that at least puts a grin on your face, then you&#039;ve come to the right place.<br />

Story: 6<br />
Sakuranomiya, Maika is a kind, ditsy girl that has a naturally sadistic look on her face. Maika is in dire need of a job; instead of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261948">
        asking her father to support her in her time of need, she decides to rely on her own willpower. After constantly failing to find a job she eventually stumbles across a café. This is basically what happened: She cast a spell on the café by using her moe powers. She was instantly hired! Here, her &#039;sadistic nature&#039; is embraced and nurtured as she spends her days having fun with her understanding friends/coworkers.<br />
<br />
Usagi-chan: &quot;Moe powers!!! Activate!!&quot;<br />
UsagiOtaku: &quot;Stop interrupting my review, Usagi-chan&quot;<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
The characters are hilarious and sweet, they bring life to the anime. Watching as their true personalities contradict with their &#039;given&#039; one, is an entertaining sight to see. Whenever a character talks about something that they&#039;re interested in, they seem to have a sparkle in their eye. Without a doubt, I&#039;m slowly beginning to love almost all the characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
I&#039;m planning on following each released episode. I&#039;m hoping that my current point of view will last until the end.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
Usagi-chan: &quot;The lack of yuri isn&#039;t going to steer me away from this anime! I&#039;m going to watch it all the way through!!&quot;<br />
UsagiOtaku: &quot;Shhhh. You&#039;re embarrassing me&quot;

    The only phrase that comes to mind after watching 8 episodes is &quot;sugy sugy big nut&quot;. A phrase commonly used by my friend to show interest, love and compasion for a certain someone or something. I can assure you that I am not lying when I say that the amount of bdogs that I popped was over the count of 3 while viewing this anime. If you desire to be overwhelmed with different characters all while being dressed up as maids with some slick animation, oh boy, this is the anime for you. Speaking of characters, the charactersitics that come along with them are nonetheless

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264213">
        refreshing. Each one bringing a new feature to the table whether it be sadistic or tsundere. It may be a slice of life but I feel as if you are given the full cake, my dude. When it comes to comedy, Blend S does it perfectly. The comedic aspects always left a smile on the face, a slap on the knee and a bdog in the pants. Overall I would give this anime a 9/10 and cannot wait for the upcoming episodes in the future.<br />

    (very minor spoilers)<br />
&quot;Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise!&quot; Now everyone has heard these words. You know, the meme that everyone loved for a while, and I still see videos of it. It has encouraged many to watch the show, fortunately or unfortunately. I&#039;ll let you decide which word to use.<br />
<br />
Blend S started off in a very cliche way. Girls bumps/meets boy, blood comes out of boy&#039;s nose, boom, now the girl is working in his maid cafe. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start with the characters, since I don&#039;t see this show having any story. It&#039;s episodic, so a new story every episode. Risky move from my bois at A1.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266851">
        The characters are pretty cliche if you ask me. You got the pretty Italian boy who is a weeb and watches manga at night a lot, missing out on sleep. Cool joke for an episode, but using it more than once made me despise Dino or Tenchou-san. Next up is the normal girl, Maika. That&#039;s it, she&#039;s normal. Sometimes she becomes sadistic on accident thanks to her look, and apparently customers at the maid cafe love it, even if they&#039;re being offered shitty food or unkind treatment. &quot;It&#039;s only jouk!&quot; Yep, a joke that ran for too long, and even jokes need to be based on reality. Then we have the truly sadistic loli, Mafuyu. She&#039;s the little sister at the cafe. She hates Dino. Cliche af. Akizuki is the more bearable character in this show, and Akizuki-Kaho was the only reason I continued to watch it. Kaho is your average high school blonde girl with big boobs. She plays games. (Is this you Tendou-san?)  The last 2 characters are Hideri and the red haired girl whose name I won&#039;t even try to remember. Hideri is a trap who wants to become an idol, and his masculine personality appears sometimes. Made for a good scene with the red haired chick, but that was it. Now the red haired girl is your average mature neesan character, who is really perverted and makes doujinshi. She looks at the relationship of Maika-Dino and gets inspired by it. The times where she interrupts to say &quot;This&#039;ll be great material&quot; are very annoying.<br />
<br />
The sound was mediocre. I don&#039;t remember most of the show&#039;s music and the ones I remember have nothing special. I guess it had an average opening, so yeah. The art was pretty good, but then again, nothing revolutionary or anything.<br />
<br />
Now enjoyment... 2 things got me watching the show: Akizuki-Kaho and the surprise(although that was till episode 8 or something). The romance throughout the show was bad, and you&#039;re better off watching Just Because than this fake romance. It got nowhere, and the ending was made to be a disappointment. Akizuki-kaho also had close to 0 development, even though I kinda liked it. Again, another disappointment. I found the show after episode 8 to be hard to watch, and I was forcing myself to finish the 20-minute episodes, often while eating so I wouldn&#039;t notice any more mistakes in the show. I really don&#039;t like hating shows, if that makes sense, but this anime is impossible for me to like. I told myself to not rate any anime less than a 6 on my list, cause that&#039;s my system, but I ended up breaking that rule. <br />
<br />
So here you go, that&#039;s my review. You&#039;re better off not watching this but I guess you could when you&#039;re depressed, since making fun of it may cheer you up.<br />

    This is a great anime to watch if you&#039;re looking for something humorous, easy to follow, and short. This is a great slice-of-life anime, although if you are looking for something with a rich and great plotline, this may not be for you. <br />
<br />
I finished this anime relatively quickly, considering I am kind of a binge-watcher. This anime can be finished in one day if you have the time, considering it is 12 episodes. I liked this anime for several reasons, such as I mentioned earlier, it&#039;s quite funny, and it&#039;s easy to follow, and I&#039;d say you can pick it up anywhere and not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334041">
        be too confused - although it&#039;s so short that you might as well watch it all! It doesn&#039;t necessarily follow a strict plotline at all, although each episode isn&#039;t necessarily just random events, because from the first episode to the last, things have changed. There is a bit of a romance aspect, but for the entire anime, it&#039;s relatively one-sided, so I wouldn&#039;t call this a romantic anime, and if you don&#039;t like romance, you should be able to handle it well. <br />
<br />
Overall, I definitely recommend this if you enjoy slice-of-life, or want to give it a try.

    After hearing the intro for this anime, I was expecting a lighthearted, fun, and interesting show. Although I did get this, many factors that comprise this show make it a lot worse than it actually could have been. <br />
<br />
Story 3/10: Not much to expect story-wise from a show about girls working in a cafe. Overall, not a good story, but this show was never meant to have a deep story anyways. Because of this, the story of the show will not have a major part in the overall score of this review.<br />
<br />
Art 7/10: The characters are very easy to look at and each have their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264003">
        own design. The differing color schemes in each character make the character designs somewhat unique. The backgrounds for this show are usually bright and well detailed. However, the art can get a bit lazy regarding background characters, as they are not detailed or shaded in the slightest.<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10: The OP is very catchy, and has spread across the internet of late. The background songs are also well-fitting for the scenarios.<br />
<br />
Character 3/10: The characters in this show are very copy-paste, with no development what-so-ever. They are all very standard and stereotypical characters with little to them outside of their &quot;roles&quot; in the cafe. Maika is an aspiring world-traveler, who is looking for a job, but cannot get one because of her &quot;evil-glare&quot;, which is made to be much worse than it actually is. Because of this she is the &quot;sadist&quot; in the cafe, who is somehow bad at her job and doesn&#039;t do it half of the time. Kaho is the &quot;gamer-girl&quot; who wastes all her money and time playing games and is a tsundere at the cafe. Nothing much else there. Mafuyu is the college-age midget, who beats up on Dino and plays the &quot;little sister&quot; role. Miu is an author who works at the cafe for &quot;inspiration&quot; in the doujinshi she writes. She plays the big sister. Dino is the foreign manager pervert guy, who lusts over Maika every episode and barely does his job. Koyo is the cuckold, girl-on-girl liking cook, who is afraid of women. Hideri is the idol, who has more secrets than I or anybody else wanted to know. (HE&#039;S THE TRAP, WHY DO THEY HAVE A TRAP IN THIS SHOW) Overall not much else to any of these characters, making them quite one dimensional and boring. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 5/10: Although I do not like the characters or the story of this show, the sound and fanservice make it a somewhat enjoyable show for what it&#039;s worth.<br />
<br />
Overall 5/10<br />
<br />

    Blend S, from just the title it tells me that this anime is about food, which it is, but also isn&#039;t at the same time.<br />
<br />
Blend S is an anime that feels light-hearted and enjoyable, it tends to focus on one character at a time which in my opinion is good as then the characters can express their personalities and traits better. Giving you an understanding of those characters really brings out the essence of this show.<br />
<br />
The story is good, every episode feels fresh and most of the time there aren&#039;t any drawbacks if you miss an episode or 2. <br />
<br />
The art is good, it fits

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310436">
        the theme of being light hearted and enjoyable.<br />
<br />
The OP &amp; ED are both originally produced by the VAs of this series which is well thought as they work in a cafe as waitresses. It feels welcoming for them to be singing the OP like how somebody greets you when you go into a restaurant.<br />
<br />
The characters&#039; personalities are well elaborated for a short 12 episode series.<br />
<br />
It was pretty enjoyable, the comedy and the characters made the show something that unique on its own.<br />
<br />
Overall, I had a pleasant time watching Blend S. If you want a break from serious anime I would recommend this one.

    I enjoyed my experience with this anime. It may not be one of my favorites, but it was still able to put a smile on my face. Full of heart, some funny comedy, and lovable characters, you are sure to have a good time. (If you like slice of life anime that is.) Now let me get to the review. <br />
<br />
Story/7: Overall, this is the weakest aspect of the show. As with most slice of life anime, this one barely has a story at all. One of the only reoccurring things in the show is the main love plot line. A nonexistent story is to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review392256">
        be expected, so I will give this one a pass. <br />
<br />
Art/9: Art is pretty good. Nothing extraordinary, just a little above average. The characters look nice, that&#039;s about it. <br />
<br />
Sound/9: Good music. That opening is a bop. The rest of the soundtrack is pretty good, but the opening is what makes it a 9.<br />
<br />
Characters/9: This is the thing that I wanted to talk about the most. This is the reason I gave this show a 9. This is the best aspect of the show. Sorry I said &quot;this&quot; so many times. These characters are great, You have the really sweet girl, that has to act sadistic. You have the tsundere that has to act sweet. You got the horny manga artist that has to act like a big sister. and you have the TRAP that is an idol. (best character by the way.) And lastly there is the manager, and the chef. They are HOT by the way. You even have a cute DOG for gosh sake! With the environment that the characters work in, they are forced to put on false personas for the job, a thing that I haven&#039;t seen done that often. The only reason I didn&#039;t give the characters section a 10, is because I have seen one slice of life/comedy that does it better. That show being The Disastrous Life of Saiki K, go check it out, it is hilarious.<br />
<br />
Overall, great show. I can see why some people don&#039;t like it, it has its&#039;s flaws, but still pretty good. Go check it out.<br />
<br />
