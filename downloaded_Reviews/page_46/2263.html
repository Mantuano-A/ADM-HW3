    Ah... Gundam X. How long I had waited to see you.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a damn shame that After War Gundam X is the least popular of all the Gundam shows, because it really is an impressive piece of work and probably one of, if not the best of Gundam spinoffs. It has the realism that Wing does not, the maturity missing from SEED, and the extra kick lacking in 00. The only Gundam since the original to be cancelled, and to be honest that&#039;s the biggest fault X has. You can&#039;t help but wonder what could&#039;ve been if only that episode count reached 50.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
At the start

        of the show we meet Garrod Ran, a young mercenary of only 15 years of age and lets just say, he does some pretty amazing stuff for a guy his age. After taking a rescue job he meets the target, Tiffa Adill, a mysterious young newtype girl. However, upon learning that his employer would only exploit her for her abilities, Garrod turns on him and joins the very group he &quot;rescued&quot; her from, the mercenary ship &quot;Freeden&quot;. With the help of Tiffa&#039;s abilities, the crew of the Freeden continues their search to help any newtypes who are being unjustly used by others.<br />
<br />
Gundam X has one very crucial element that no other Gundam spinoff does. It feels like a U.C. show. In the world of Gundam X, the colonists have seemingly dropped all of the colonies down to the Earth as opposed to just one, and the human population is relatively miniscule. Because of this, many people consider the After War universe to be an alternate reality to the Universal Century, as opposed to a standalone universe such as the Cosmic Era from SEED or the Future Century from G Gundam.<br />
<br />
Without spoiling anything I have to point out again that Gundam X ended 11 episodes early at episode 39 as opposed to 50. Because of this a lot of people feel the ending is rushed. I have to disagree to an extent. Although the ending moves very fast(quite a bit happens in those last 8 episodes in very little time) it wraps things up quite nicely and I can&#039;t but feel that&#039;s almost exactly how the original ending would&#039;ve gone. Still, I&#039;d love to see those missing 11 episodes.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
The art style is good, but let&#039;s just say the animation could&#039;ve had a better budget for its time. Roughly the same quality as Wing. Definitely the biggest negative to X in the aesthetics department, but it&#039;s more good than bad. The gundam designs are pretty outlandish, but for how badass they look, they aren&#039;t invincible, unlike the SEED and Wing gundams, which is great. The Freeden pilots have an uphill battle ahead of them.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
Great voice acting and one hell of a score. The Gundam X openings (by the amazing group Romantic Mode) are some of my favorite openings in all the anime I&#039;ve seen, and in regards to the ending credits, I rarely sit through ending credits but for this show I made an exception. The three ending themes(two of them are different language versions of the same song) are some the best that I&#039;ve ever heard used in anything, anime or otherwise. As for the score, I&#039;m always humming one or two tracks here and there. Great soundtracks.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
At first I thought this was the biggest weakness Gundam X had. A few episodes later and I was proved wrong. All I can say without spoiling you is that it&#039;s definitely enough character development. At first the show seems to be only about Tiffa and Garrod, but over time it focuses on other characters well enough. Tiffa and Garrod are still the most important characters, but it doesn&#039;t terribly overshadow the anyone else. There are still flaws, such as expanding on a few bit characters who don&#039;t show up for more than 10 minutes of screen time, and the Frost Brothers up until the last arc, but overall it&#039;s all good.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
Gundam X is definitely not the best Gundam show, but damn if it isn&#039;t the most likeable. It&#039;s hard to hate this show. It may not be a masterpiece, but it&#039;s one hell of a ride from start to finish. Garrod in particular is just an amazingly well done protagonist. He&#039;s impossible to hate, and he&#039;s always believable. He&#039;s extremely street smart, but not a genius; very skilled in battle but not exactly soldier by any sense of the word. From the very first episode, he is kicking things in gear and you just want to strap yourself in for the roller coaster ride he&#039;s going to deliver.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
I like to refer to Gundam X as the Daft Punk of Gundam. Anyone who&#039;s experienced it can&#039;t hate it in the least. I give it a 9 because hell, I can&#039;t deny how much fun I had. I enjoyed this more than G Gundam, and that&#039;s saying a hell of a lot. A great balance of the always enjoyable shonen heroism while still keeping that tomino-esque reality that the original gundams had. You can even find some parallels between X and Tomino&#039;s own Crossbone Gundam graphic novel, strangely enough. If you can watch After War Gundam X, then do so. Chances are you won&#039;t be disappointed.

    Alll I can say is, this is definitely one of the most underrated Gundams of the franchise, and an underrated anime in general. I don&amp;rsquo;t get why the hell they can bring SEED and SEED Destiny, and not X and/or Turn A? What I really liked about this series was it took a different direction with the newtype concept that was a re-occuring element in the UC sagas, mostly in Zeta and CCA. Yes, newtypes can be elite pilots, but Tifa demonstrates that newtypes aren&amp;rsquo;t exclusive to this rolel. Granted the extremity this anime took with that concept felt out of place for Gundam, in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8637">
        no ways did I feel any sense of intensity or suspense was ruined, but I felt it built it up. I would elaborate how unique this series makes its own interpretation of the newtype concept but it would be a spoiler and I encourage you to see the series for yourself to understand what I mean. <br />
<br />
But other than that, it still retains the other characteristics from other Gundam series, and redefines and advances them. Garoad you can say is more of a modern day interpretation of Judeau Ashita from Double Zeta. He&amp;rsquo;s young, but he&amp;rsquo;s a guy who is out doing his job and circumstances just led him to where he is. What&amp;rsquo;s also unique is that he&amp;rsquo;s not a newtype but yet, he just naturally develops his piloting skills. Tifa&amp;rsquo;s character was just new to me, and I felt the nature of her character felt out of place for Gundam, but because this isn&amp;rsquo;t the original Gundam and the intention was to go for something different and new, I felt she just simply served her purpose though I don&amp;rsquo;t personally call her a top 5 female Gundam character. And as usual, the series will still have villains and antagonists you can relate to which the Frost bros do well at. The series does have some interesting twists and turns that will keep you guessing in relation to the characters and the overall story. I feel that because it&amp;rsquo;s uniquely both characteristically and not characteristically Gundam at the same time give a new distinction it&amp;rsquo;s trademark characteristics.<br />
<br />
Well, this series premiered after Gundam Wing, so most of the color schemes and gimmicks of the mechs will probably not really stand out since it mostly follows the approach that Gundam Wing has. But I guess some of the features of the GX where its main weapon needs to be powered by a satellite brings a new element to the engineering and the firepower that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been used in past sagas makes it more fresh. And as I stated earlier, the mechs in general don&amp;rsquo;t have any qualities that are necessarily fresh or new. Like the Leopard is pretty much a green colored firearms, and the design of the GX looks like the Wing Gundam but with a different set of wings.<br />
<br />
The character designs mostly in relation to the costume are a little wilder than your typical Gundam series, thus giving some reflection to its post apocalyptic nature. But other than that, you have generic bishounen and bishoujo designs but very tolerable. My favorite design is that of Jamil with a modern day old school approach. He wears a very ancient military style uniform, and his side burns and hair style is something more characteristic of a 1970s anime hero. And Tanya is just simply hot.The character design is nothing really cutting edge but still appropriate for its setting at some capacity. The battles are pretty interesting since a majority of this Gundam series takes place on Earth and I was wondering if there was ever going to be any traditional space battles, which has always been an iconic trait of the franchise. But I feel that the engineering and the gimmicks of the Gundams presented justified keeping the battles on earth territory for most of the series. But the battles are still intense and they excellently know how to apply land and air war fare with a different approach with more reliance on transforming mechs. <br />
<br />
Personally, I loved Takagi Wataru&amp;rsquo;s unique approach to playing Garoad Ran. Even though he&amp;rsquo;s achieved world fame as Onizuka Eikichi from GTO, I loved how he still retained his nasal voice and make Garoad come across as a teenager and as a wise ass. I thought it was a very brilliant performance. Granted Garoad has comedic traits, I think Takagi&amp;rsquo;s addition who mostly does comedy roles does a great job in a more serious role such as this one himself. I think Jamil&amp;rsquo;s voice actor, Horiuchi Kenyuu who is famous as playing Raiden in the Metal Gear Solid games brought a unique charisma to his character and also made him sound very intimidating. And another unique actress is Mitsuishi Kotono, who was also still playing Sailor Moon at the time is also the voice of Tanya, the bridge captain. Later she would come back to Gundam SEED. as the Captain of the Archangel. With her role in Gundam X, she brought Misato&amp;rsquo;s party girl side to her character. <br />
<br />
The music is just intense and beautiful. The opening theme DREAMS just has this militaristic feel with how it opens, but yet transitions to this powerful song about hope and determination, and the ending themes sung in English sound like Love Lift Us Where We Belong, but brought a refreshing feel to the series. The background music is very appropriate for the series.<br />
<br />
Well, sadly, this Gundam had to be cut due to low ratings, but I heard that this series is finding rejuvenation in Japan with the DVD releases and people are appreciating it more. Artistically as I said earlier, it really does nothing to advance Gundam but I think it still maintained its spirit and really brought a unique and distinctive redefinition to some of its original foundation. Such as the themes and concepts behind the series with new types was what made it unique and was first brought into an alternate universe of Gundam which would later be brought back in SEED which I think they did a bad job of that concept in that series. I say it is required to have some familiarity with the original Gundam to understand the origin of its concepts such as colony drops and newtypes, and some familiarity with Gundam Wing to understand the mech design and style. This is something truly made for Gundam fans, and I think this is probably something that a casual anime fan or a hardcore anime fan that isn&amp;rsquo;t into Gundam could probably handle.  <br />

    Gundam X gets a bad reputation much of the time due to the fact that it was canceled&amp;mdash;the only Gundam since the original to get cut short. We&#039;ll probably never know what set of circumstances led to the early end of its broadcast in Japan, but there is one thing I can say. Much like the original Gundam series, Gundam X was extremely underappreciated in its time.<br />
<br />
In a technical sense, the art, music and sound effects are roughly equal to Gundam Wing. They were produced back to back, so this is expectable. If you&#039;ve seen Gundam Wing, then you know what Gundam X looks and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5695">
        sounds like.<br />
<br />
What really sets Gundam X apart, especially from its immediate predecessor, is its characters. Gundam X is full of characters that you can actually care about. In particular, Garrod and Tifa&#039;s relationship is extremely genuine and endearing. This is quite a feat for a genre of anime not particularly well known for being able to develop a believable romance.<br />
<br />
The plot of Gundam X is well paced, keeping a good momentum and tension throughout. Each episode tends to leave you hanging, and craving more. This structure worked well for Escaflowne, and it works very well here too.<br />
<br />
Overall, don&#039;t write this Gundam off just because you heard it got canceled. I consider this the best of the AU Gundam series, and enjoy it on the same level as the original series. Any Gundam or mecha fan should see this series.

    Before watching Gundam X, I often heard how it was considered to be one of worst Gundam series out there since it only ran for 39 episodes, since it had been canceled due to low rating. But after finishing it just now, I have to say, its probably one of the best Gundam series I&#039;ve seen and quite possibly one of the more under appreciated anime out there.<br />
<br />
Story: Gundam X takes place 15 years after the war between the Earth forces and Space Rebellion which wiped out almost all of the Earth&#039;s population due to the use of Newtypes, individuals with advanced abilities. The story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29211">
        follows Garrod Ran, a 15 year old boy who runs into a mysterious girl called Tiffa and later decides to join the Freeden, a ship led by Jamil Neate, a former &quot;hero&quot; in the war(think Amuro Ray), in order to protect Tiffa, while traveling the Earth to prevent the abusive use of Newtypes and eventually to stop a war that could result in the same tragedy 15 years ago. The plot set-up can almost be thought of as a pre-cursor to Eureka 7, the main character chooses to join a group of ragtag individuals in order to protect a girl they&#039;ve taken interest in,not to fight for peace or anything close to it. <br />
<br />
Art: Being released in 1996, the art looks dated but still holds up fairly well 14 years since its release. For those who have seen Gundam Wing, you know what you&#039;re expecting<br />
<br />
Sound: The sound effects and background music are fairly well done( despite the fx sounding a bit old-school and thus similar to Wing again), but the opening themes are very well done and quite catchy too.<br />
<br />
Characters: Despite the high enjoyment quality of all other Gundam shows, most of the main characters, were rather annoying, throwing out angst and other &quot;emo&quot; actions that seemed rather siily. Gundam X has a decent set of characters that are all fairly fleshed out and really likable and don&#039;t display any of the cliches established by its predecessors. Garrod is a rather interesting main lead and often displays some traits that most teens could relate to. Despite some &quot;angst&quot; he displays in the few beginning episodes of the anime, it actually makes sense why he acts this way. Jamil is a mix of Char, Amuro and even Bright, and acts as the leader figure among the crew of the Freeden and his past involvement in the war only makes him more interesting. Roybea and Witz, the other 2 Gundam pilots, are interesting characters as well and they even have good intentions being involved with the Freeden. The Frost brothers are the ones who truly shine in this show, they are the very definition of evil and will do whatever they want to get what they want.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Every episode was well done and did a good job of building up to the conclusion. It started out as showing out with showing how the entire cast only worked to find Newtypes scattered around the globe, but slowly begun to realize that encountering them would lead to them becoming involved in a war once again. The only flaw I can think of is that the show was cut short, so starting around episode 30 to the last episode, it felt a bit rushed as I was hit with so much information in a few episodes, but was wrapped up really well overall.<br />
<br />
Overall: Don&#039;t let the fact that Gundam X gets a bad vibe from many Gundam fans steer you away from watching this. The plot is well paced and the characters are all done fairly well and even has a bit of the political themes found in almost every Gundam series( but to a more limited extent here). This under-appreciated gem is a must watch for anyone who is a fan of mecha, romance or anyone who is an anime fan in general.

    Before I even watched Gundam X. I have been told by people that Gundam X is either one of the most underrated Gundam shows or one of the worst Gundam shows. Also, notice that Gundam X only had 39 episodes instead of 49 episodes like Wing. Well after finishing Gundam X from start to finish I really have to say this. Gundam X is not only one of the best Gundam shows that I have seen but it’s one of the most underrated animes I have ever seen in a long while.<br />
Why is that you may ask?<br />
You will soon find out.<br />
<br />
Story.<br />
It is the year after

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256735">
        war fifteen. Fifteen years after the 7th space war which ultimately destruction of the whole world and killing billions of people. Many of the surviving residents of Earth now try to make a living as best as they can in the new post apocalyptic world with many of the mobile suits and the technology that was left over from the war becoming extremely valuable to many civilians and organizations.<br />
<br />
The story of Gundam X mainly focuses on a 15-year boy named Garrod Ran who make a living by selling and taking old jobs. He eventually gets hired to rescue a mysterious young girl named Tiffa who is later revealed to be a special kind of human called a newtype.<br />
<br />
During a struggle between Garrod and the people who hired him, he discovers a powerful mobile suit that took part in the 7th space war and that mobile suit is called the Gundam X. He uses it to fight off his enemies and protect Tiffa. The two young teens meet up with a crew of vultures lead by Jamil a man who wants to rescue and protect new-types like Tiffa from being exploited by enemy organizations. Soon Enough Garrod and Tiffa part of the crew and throughout the series they will come face to face with various opponents that as the prevent another war.<br />
<br />
The story of Gundam X is really good and well executed <br />
Aside from some typical elements from the Gundam franchise like the young boy discovering a Gundam as the presence of char clone kinda character, it&#039;s unlike most of the other Gundam shows that are out there. All of the Gundam shows minus G Gundam, this show Turn A, Build Fighters and G Reco revolve around a full-scale war between two factions but Gundam X in a post apocalyptic setting where people are trying to prevent war and most of humanity is trying to regain their lives. Out of all of the alternative universe shows Gundam X has the closet with the universal century timeline.as it has a lot of elements that we all familiar with within the universal century such as the appearance of newtypes. The newtypes in X play a much bigger war in X than any of the Universal Century shows.<br />
Themes of exploitation, power abuse, moving forward in the future instead of being clinging to the past were well explored and they expanded as the series progresses.<br />
<br />
If I had minor complaints of the story in X it would be the pacing for certain story arcs. Unlike in Gundam Wing constantly had bad pacing as well as having too much info-dumping from that stupid narrator. Gundam X mostly had good pacing but some of the arcs were either pacing way too long or way too fast like the final arc which I will explain now.<br />
Gundam X was originally gonna to have 49 episodes like Gundam Wing and G Gundam but it was reduced to 39 episodes after the decline of the ratings.<br />
This explains why the ending of Gundam X was kinda rushed as well as having no time to build up a proper climax. Despite that, the ending of Gundam X does ties up most of the loose ends giving us the feeling of satisfaction.<br />
Overall despite Gundam X being cut down to 39 episodes, I thought the story of Gundam X was really good and well written.<br />
8.5/10<br />
<br />
Characters.<br />
The characters in Gundam X are mostly great as they are very likable, relatable and they were enjoyable to watch from start to finish.<br />
<br />
Garrod is honestly one of my favorite Gundam protagonists.<br />
He may have an outgoing personality who is filled with life but he&#039;s not afraid to get serious when he needs to be. Also unlike Heero his a well-written character who gets great character development. What makes Garrod stand out from other main protagonists from Gundam that he is just a normal kid. No special powers( Amero), no intense military training( Heero) and no martial arts mastery (Domon). He is just a normal human like you and I. Even though his a normal human being he still proves himself to be a badass pilot.<br />
<br />
Tiffa is one of the best female characters from the franchise.<br />
She is quiet and tends to hide her emotions but she starts to open up more as the series progresses especially around Garrod. Tiffa&#039;s role in Gundam X is unique in Gundam since she is a newtype with extraordinary powers thus making her a very valuable target for many people that tried to capture her.<br />
<br />
The relationship between Garrod and Tiffa gives a lot of Eureka Seven vibes even though Eureka Seven came out after this show. The one thing that I really loved about it is how different they personalities are. Garrod a loud mouth while Tiffa is calm and collecting. Aside from that, it&#039;s a really down to earth relationship that was build up extremely well and it makes you believe that they are really made for each other. It’s personally one of my favorite pairings in the Gundam franchise.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another character that I really like is Jamil who is one of my favorite captains from the franchise. His background is based off Amuro Ray but his adult personality is very similar to Bright Noa with a little bit of Char mixed it making him a great badass combination of three of the most iconic characters in the franchise.<br />
Roybea may be a lady&#039;s man and Witz may be a hot headed but they much more dimensional to them as characters as opposed to the Wing boys in Wing, The Mary sues in Seed, and the Try Fighters from Build Fighters Try<br />
<br />
The other characters are also great and very likable with some of my other favorite Gundam X characters being Ennil El,  Malme Toniya and Kid Salsamille.<br />
<br />
The only characters I was not a fan were the Frost Brothers aka the main villains as they come off as generic villains’ They were not bad characters but they could have been much better but the end of the day I pick the Frost Brothers over the Try Fighters and the Wing Boys.<br />
<br />
Minus the Frost Brothers, I thought the character cast for Gundam X to be pretty great as they are very memorable likable, interesting not to mention they have a purpose and have an important role in the story.<br />
<br />
This is one of my favorite characters casts from the Gundam franchise.<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Visuals.<br />
Visually Gundam X is very similar to Wing, however, it a massive improvement over Wing in every field.<br />
<br />
The characters designs are well designed and they are mostly consistent.<br />
<br />
As for the actual animation, it&#039;s a big step from Wing. The mecha battles are fun to watch and we actually see a lot of skill being shown by the pilots throughout the fights.<br />
<br />
Also, the mecha designs are really good.<br />
<br />
The Gundam X may appear like average Gundam but once the moon is out and it charges its satellite cannon. It will terminate anything in its path. The X divider is pretty cool but its big brother the double X is in my top 3 favorite Gundams. Gundam Leopard<br />
<br />
The other Gundam designs also great Gundams like the Air Master, Gundam Leopard, and the Versago.<br />
<br />
Overall the visuals of Gundam X are really good as it a massive improvement over Gundam Wing and the battles were very exciting.<br />
8.5/10<br />
<br />
Sound.<br />
The soundtrack of Gundam X is just beautiful filled with memorable tracks.<br />
<br />
The first opening Dream is a very hard hitting J POP song.<br />
<br />
The same thing can be said to the second opening theme Resolution which is one of one of my favorite opening themes in Gundam.<br />
<br />
The first ending theme Human Touch is easily one of the best composed in all of Gundam as well as being one of my favorite ending themes in anime.<br />
<br />
The second ending theme Gin-Iro Horizon is pretty good.<br />
The voice acting of Gundam X is amazing that is filled a lot of talented and high profile Seiyuus.<br />
<br />
Some of my favorites performances were Knyuu Horiuchi as Jamil, Mika Kanai as Tiffa, Chieko Honda as Ennil, Motoko Kumai as Kid Salsamile, Kazuya Nakai as Witz and I could go on.<br />
Sadly Gundam X didn’t get a dub which is honestly sad because if anything this was the show that needed a dub.<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts.<br />
Overall I really liked Gundam X. I think is one of the best Gundam shows from the franchise.<br />
<br />
The story was well written, almost all of the characters were great, relatable and likable, the visuals still hold up well compared to Gundam Wing, the mecha battles were exciting to watch and the soundtrack is just amazing.<br />
If this show were to have all 49 episodes as well maybe having an English dub than I would have giving it a 10/10 as well as being my favorite Gundam show but sadly that isn’t the case.<br />
<br />
Gundam X ended getting canceled making it the only other Gundam show besides Gundam 0079 to get canceled before finished. There’s has been a lot of speculation on why it was canceled. One theory stated that it got low ratings due to a sudden timeslot switch and an another theory state that people were just burned out from watching Gundam after four years of back to back releases. Whatever the case may be I still thought Gundam X was an amazing show and I consider it to be one of the best Gundam shows in the franchise.<br />
<br />
If you are tired of Gundam having the same old formula from past Gundam shows then I highly recommend watching Gundam X as it offers a different yet amazing experience for anime fans as well as hardcore Gundam fans.<br />
Gundam X has been licensed by Rightstuff in the US on DVD. <br />
<br />
Final Score 8.5/10

    - Story<br />
Gundam X takes on a &#039;what if&#039; scenario. Basically &#039;What it Amuro Ray from Gundam UC0079 had never stumbled across the Gundam RX-78? Basically, the war would have dragged on and ended with many space colonies dropped onto the Earth wiping out most of humanity and destabilizing Earth&#039;s weather.<br />
<br />
15 years have passed since the war ended and the story from here on follows 15 year old Garrod Ran, pilot of the Gundam X, on his journey along with the crew of an all-terrain ship called the Freeden in their quest in search of Newtypes around the world and offer them protection from anyone out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review70189">
        to find them and use them to start another war. <br />
<br />
Throughout the journey, he is assigned to protect the Freeden&#039;s most important crew member, Tiffa Adill, a girl with Newtype powers that are sought after by anyone who knows of her and her abilities as well as Garrod&#039;s love interest. We&#039;ve seen love interests in Gundam but none of the relationships affected the story like in X. Garrod and Tiffa&#039;s relationship is the most authentic you&#039;ll see in Gundam.<br />
<br />
Nothing you&#039;ll see in this story is arbitrary, the characters are all well-conceived for the post-apocalyptic Earth setting. So there&#039;s always some rhyme or reason for each character&#039;s history and actions. And I bloody praise the show for its clever writing.<br />
<br />
- Animation:<br />
You can tell it’s dated 90’s animation but not to the point where it looks obsolete and hideous compared to cleaner anime like SEED, 00, and AGE. It’s still a joy to look at especially since this reduced the amount of recycled animation which was present  in and many other anime shows at its time and if was digitally remastered, get ready to eat your heart out. <br />
<br />
It would be an understatement to say that this series art style and animation is ‘similar’ Wing’s because it is in fact EXACTLY the same to the point where it would feel like watching a redimensionalized version of it. You could take a character from Wing and put him/her in X or vice versa and they’d fit in perfectly. Even the mech designs are Wing-ish. <br />
<br />
- Music and Sound<br />
The soundtrack is a mixed bag, some are good, some are dull and easily forgettable. In fact, it’s kind of disappointing that they didn&#039;t do as good a job  with Zeta Gundam and Wing series.<br />
<br />
- Overall<br />
This series was the most refreshing of all the Gundams I&#039;ve seen. It does contain familiar elements but at the same time it takes liberties in such a clever way to prevent it from not being Gundam. It is different from other Gundams for these reasons, and they are a big deal<br />
<br />
- It&#039;s post-apocalyptic <br />
- Strong romantic subplot<br />
- Takes place mostly on Earth<br />
- No war<br />
<br />
Regardless of what may or may not have happened if X&#039;s animation crew had their way with episode count and story progression, whatever they had to wrap up was done well without leaving anything unresolved. So for what it is, Gundam X is in my opinion a true gem not just in the Gundam sagas, but in anime in general.

    I&#039;ve heard of Gundam X receiving mixed receptions from fans of the Gundam franchise with some going as far as considering it the &quot;black sheep&quot; of the franchise. So curious to see what the series had going for it, I chose to download the series and see if it was anything worthwhile. Suffice to say, I think I can see why reception to this series is mixed.<br />
<br />
Gundam X is supposed to depict a &quot;what if&quot; scenario in the Gundam franchise to depict what would happen to Earth if the war between Oldtypes and Newtypes got heated enough where a space colony drop was implemented and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review66857">
        devastated the human population and atmosphere on Earth. To a degree, Gundam X does a solid job in setting up its world featuring many people trying to survive on their own and groups of hired vigilantes and thieves known as Vultures taking up jobs for any money they need for their survival or mercilessly destroying and killing anything in their way for personal gain. Remains of the Federation still exist in this new era as they try to reclaim the old power that they once had by conquering areas of the world that refuse to unite under their cause. Newtypes are also focused on as they still face a good amount of prejudice in this world with corporations and Federation forces still seeing them as tools of war and some elements similar to racism are brought up in later episodes regarding differences with the origins of Newtypes and their abilities.<br />
<br />
What does work against the series though would be its style of plotting and its very characters. Gundam X is divided up into several plot arcs focused on the journey of Garrod, Tiffa and the crew of the Freeden as they seek out Newtypes, evade hostile Vulture ships, evade Federation forces and try to prevent a second catastrophic event like the colony drop from 15 years ago. While the arcs help to flesh out more elements to the world of Gundam X and occasionally develop the characters, the pacing to said arcs in many instances tend to be a bit slow and cause progression to grind to a halt at points. I also found that the series was trying too hard at dramatizing a number of serious scenes that took place throughout the show thanks to its overuse of angst and melodrama with its major developments. The last arc for the show&#039;s final two episodes is rushed in its developments special thanks to said early cancellation of the show as the series tried to cram the major plot developments for said final arc. The final arc is notable in that it reveals the origin of Newtypes, but said revelation felt vague and left a sour taste in my mouth. Gundam fans might not want to take what is revealed at the end at heart considering this is another alternate continuity in the series franchise.<br />
<br />
I also had issues with many of the characters portrayed throughout Gundam X as well considering many just followed standard character archetypes found in other anime or being used as plot devices you would have seen done before in earlier Gundam titles. Male lead Garrod&#039;s the hot-headed and defiant teen you would have already seen with Amuro and Kamille, only he&#039;s not as well-fleshed out as the two mentioned characters and he quite often has to conveniently get his hide saved in life-threatening situations by other members of the Freeden crew or other new characters that happen to be around, which make me question why he even is the male lead of this series. Female lead Tiffa isn&#039;t much better off either as her character is much more flat than Garrod&#039;s as she plays the all too-common &quot;shy, quiet and reserved female character&quot; archetype needing a male lead to give her a confidence boost which has been done to death in enough modern otaku-pandering shows. As you can pretty much see, I could care less about the romantic developments that Gundam X was pushing with these two because of how shallow and archetypal their characters were. I don&#039;t even want to get started mentioning the Frost Brothers as I found them to be the weakest villains I&#039;ve seen in any Gundam series that I&#039;ve seen thus far due to how poorly developed and shallow that their motivations were for their actions and manipulations throughout the series.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation, Gundam X is of standard animation quality you would find for a mid-90s anime series. Yet compared to Gundam Wing which was made around the same time period, X is better polished in its scenery and character designs and its quality doesn&#039;t degrade in heavy action scenes like what occurs with Wing. However, the show still relies on a number of animation shortcuts as reused frames and speed stripes are used rather frequently throughout Gundam X. Much of the music used throughout the series consists of low-pitched and fast-paced tracks used for the title&#039;s tense moments and action scenes while more slow-paced and light instrumental tracks are used for the title&#039;s calmer and dramatic moments. Both diversities do their part in enhancing the key scenes that take place throughout Gundam X, but nothing memorable stuck out with them for me. And while I did enjoy listening to the English and Japanese versions of the title&#039;s ED song, &quot;Human Touch&quot;, I didn&#039;t think the song fitted in too well for a Gundam series and seemed better suited for a romance drama title.<br />
<br />
Overall, Gundam X did present some interesting ideas for its &quot;what if&quot; scenario in the setup of its post-apocalyptic world from the heated Oldtype/ Newtype conflict from Universal Century titles in the Gundam franchise. Unfortunately, the title&#039;s cliched characters and style of plotting did hurt its overall quality for me as it didn&#039;t seem to want to try making something as significantly different and unique like Turn A Gundam for an alternate continuity series. I guess as many will say, your mileage will vary on how well you get latched on Gundam X as I certainly didn&#039;t find myself enjoying it all too well.

    After War Gundam X was the third alternate universe Gundam series to be created, preceded by Mobile Fighter G Gundam and Mobile Suit Gundam Wing. Following hot on the heels of Wings 50 episode run, Gundam X shared a very similar art style and mobile suit designs. However, due to a very bad time slot as well as franchise fatigue(X aired two weeks after Wing finished, and Wing itself had begun airing two weeks following G&#039;s run.), Gundam X was cut down from 50 episodes to 39, causing the ending of the series to be rushed and parts cut out. Though surprisingly, this did not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178317">
        detract at all from the story, though it didn&#039;t really do it any favors either.<br />
<br />
Part of the reason that Gundam X still succeeded despite the rushed story was because of the excellent characters and their development. The protagonist is Garrod Ran, a 15 year old orphan who made a living taking high risk jobs and defending his home from Vultures. What separates Garrod from most Gundam protagonists is that he is not some special snowflake. He is an average Human being who happens to be good at piloting mobile suits. And he isn&#039;t some concealed Newtype or anything like that, because two of his companions would know right away, and they never said a word. Garrod manages to accomplish feats that rival that of Newtypes, which makes him one of the most powerful Gundam protagonists due to his ability to adapt to any enemy or situation. Alongside him are the Newtypes Tifa Adiil and Jamil Neate, as well as the mercenaries Roybea Loy and Witz Sou, along with the rest of the Freeden crew. What&#039;s satisfying is that almost all of these characters are likable in their own ways and have their own stories to tell.<br />
<br />
The emotional impact of Gundam X is emphasized by its soundtrack, which is just plain beautiful. The ending theme &quot;Human Touch&quot; is just so good that I had it on repeat for weeks. What I found odd and yet refreshing is that it is entirely in English, despite the fact that the series was never dubbed. It&#039;s a beautiful song, and one that deserves to be heard even without the context of the series. The sound effects or course are mostly reused from Wing, which honestly goes well with the art style which is, again, pretty much the same as Wing.<br />
<br />
The theme of this series is something that I had never come across before in anime: Labels. We&#039;re all familiar with how labels work. When you give something or someone a label, you are essentially defining who or what they are because that label comes with a predefined definition. In this case, Oldtypes and Newtypes. And each faction has a different definition for each of these labels, which leads to the series major conflicts. This was a refreshing change from the usual themes and the series conclusion did justice to that theme.<br />
<br />
In the end, After War Gundam X is quite possibly one of the greatest Gundam series to ever be produced. The problem with its popularity lies in the time slot it was placed in as well as the timing of its release. Both of those factors contributed to its commercial downfall. It has, however, gained a cult following in the many years since its initial release in 1997. This series truly deserved a full 50 episodes, and had it been aired in the US following Wing, its likely that it may have seen the popularity it truly deserved. I recommend this series to anyone who could use a break from the normal themes or is just looking for a great story and characters. I highly doubt you will be disappointed.

    I don&#039;t like mecha anime. I never did like anime about giant robots beating each other up, mostly because they were either too complicated for me to understand, especially with technobabble and politics, or because they just never appealed to me. I watched Gundam 00 when it first came out, but only because of Tieria, and I&#039;ve seen a few episodes of Gundam Build Fighters since it&#039;s different, but I had to put it on hold partly due to real life obligations, and partly because it didn&#039;t really hook me. I didn&#039;t think there would ever be a day where I would like a giant

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179872">
        robot anime...but then I discovered Gundam X. Wow, I never thought I&#039;d say this, as I&#039;m not a fan of the Gundam franchise in general, but I really freaking love Gundam X! It has everything I want in an anime: an interesting but easy to understand storyline, great characters with their own lives and backstories, beautiful animation, a great soundtrack, great twists, my goodness, I could sing about Gundam X all day, and I will!<br />
<br />
The story begins after a terrible war between the Space Revolutionary Army and the Earth Federation. After a space colony was driven into Earth, the planet became a shambled mess, and everyone on it had to endure years of hard times. People in space have still progressed, but Earth is still having trouble. In the midst of those hard times, a boy named Garrod and a psychic Newtype girl named Tiffa (No, NOT Tiffa Lockhart if that&#039;s what you&#039;re thinking) are brought together thanks to an old Federation mobile suit, the GX-9900, aka the Gundam X, and meet in a rogue battleship called the Frieden, led by ex-Newtype Jamil Neate and his friends. Together, they have to fight various empires and make sure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated and learn the truth about Newtypes and the world around them.<br />
<br />
Gundam X originally had 49-50 episodes planned, but due to insane amounts of executive meddling, the episodes were cut down to 39. But oddly enough, that didn&#039;t stop the writers from wanting to resolve it in the way they felt was best and giving it a good ending. The fact that they cared enough about this show really shows in everything, the animation being one such example. It looks rather messy compared to some other shows that were airing during the time, but that messiness actually works, since the conflicts between various parties, such as Earth and space, are also very messy. But it also helps to bring out a kind of untainted beauty within everything else. Also, have I mentioned how much I absolutely ADORE the character designs? Everyone looks practical, like they could be real people you could run into! Garrod looks like a football jock, Jamil looks like a shellshocked veteran, Tiffa looks like that girl you could sit next to in school, everyone just looks great without being over the top. Plus, the character movements are very fluid and the explosions and designs of the Gundams all play off each other very well and are drawn beautifully. It&#039;s just very appealing to me.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is another glorious thing I must sing praises about, as it&#039;s just wonderful! The opening songs are hotblooded but still subdued and try not to be too over the top, while the ending themes are soft, soothing ballads. I especially adore Human Touch, and Warren Wiebe&#039;s voice is beautiful. His song is just so nice, uplifting, and inspiring! It&#039;s a shame he had to go before his time, from what I&#039;ve read on various articles. But it does kind of suffer a problem that Kiniro no Corda: Blue Sky had, where a BGM piece would continue playing and then suddenly get cut off by something else, such as the eyecatch. Thankfully, it&#039;s not as bad here as it was in Corda, but it&#039;s still rather noticeable if you pay close attention.<br />
<br />
The characters are obviously the best part of the series, and the thing is, at first they start off like they&#039;re going to devolve into their stereotype, but completely go against it as the series goes on. Normally I absolutely hate the idiot heroes who go against orders, cause trouble, and are hyper, but...I really like Garrod! 1. He actually matures and develops. 2. The circumstances behind his bad decisions are actually explored. 3. He&#039;s actually a lot smarter than he looks, plus the fact that his first scene is his hijacking a mobile suit with a gun and a grenade! And normally I absolutely despise the perfect little yamato nadeshiko characters as they usually don&#039;t do much, but...I really like Tiffa! Sure, she&#039;s shy, quiet, and can be a damsel in distress sometimes, but she actually does do things in the series, has her own wishes, and doesn&#039;t always rely on others, and she also develops awesomely. It&#039;s very slow and gradual, but she develops. She could have easily been written badly, but the writers executed her character very well. All the other characters are great too, with their own quirks, personalities, lives, and weaknesses that play off of each other very well. I especially find myself liking Jamil, as I thought he&#039;d been kind of a good hearted but strict boss, but he&#039;s actually not as uptight as I expected him to be. I even find myself liking the two main villains, because their struggle and petty reasons for doing what they do is very relatable, and the fact that they go to great lengths just to get what they want really makes them good villains. They actually go out and do something and try to make their vision happen, not just sit around on a throne and watch everything. That&#039;s what makes a good villain! Make them proactive and willing to get what they want, no matter what it takes!<br />
<br />
But speaking of the characters, I do find one flaw about most of them: their backstories haven&#039;t been fully explored, especially Tiffa&#039;s! Where are her parents?! What kind of life did she live before she came to the Frieden? None of that is explored here! At least some episodes focused on Jamil, Witz, and Roybea, and Garrod and Toniya&#039;s pasts has only been touched upon with single lines of dialogue, that&#039;s it. I love these characters dearly, but I&#039;d care for them a whole lot more if we knew what their lives were like. The Digimon series was very good at this. Also, there are some things that don&#039;t really get explained, and when they&#039;re brought up once, they&#039;re never brought up again. For example, in episodes 2 and 3, it&#039;s established that Tiffa has the ability to feel the pain people on the battlefield feel as they die and because it&#039;s too much for her to handle, she falls unconscious...but after that, it&#039;s never seen or brought up again, even during times when it should happen, it doesn&#039;t. Consistency, people! It&#039;s not that hard!<br />
<br />
Yeah, I like a mecha anime. Never thought I&#039;d say that. I also never thought it&#039;d wind up being one of my all time favorite anime. What are you sitting around here for? Go and watch it!

    After war gundam resets the values created by the UC timeline. This gundam asks &quot;what-if&quot; this happened in the one year war, and the after math is what&#039;s presented in the anime. The characters are deep, the plot is deep, the only thing holding this anime back was the sound and animation. Other than that, if you&#039;re a UC gundam fan, you would absolutely love this and will not regret expanding your UC gundam lore.<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10, a great one!

    Gundam X is, in my very, very personal opinion, the best Gundam series. It has flaws, and its run is completely disappointing, but if there&#039;s something Gundam X that most other Gundam series fail at (with a couple of exceptions), is that it presents, it portrays, characters that are sympathetic, likeable and act in character throughout the entire show.<br />
Garrod is a teenager, and acts like one; Tiffa lives up to her Newtype status by being a shy, lonely girl, who slowly opens up to other people; Jamil is the conflicted, but wise and disciplinary, mentor, who is protective of his subordinates and those he cares

          <span style="display: none;" id="review85901">
        about; and I could go on.<br />
Gundam X has characters than have that human factor, which allow an average viewer who isn&#039;t even familiar with the franchise to highly enjoy this show.<br />
<br />
Now if there is another thing I commend Gundam X of doing, is that the series isn&#039;t like most of its &quot;AU&quot; brethren (Alternate Universes, for those not very familiar with Gundam terminology): while it indeed has the obligatory UC (Universal Century) references and tradition in it, it actually does something with them: whereas shows like SEED and AGE simply use these tropes and copy paste them on their own shows, X deves into them, cooks them up, and creates its own identity using this exact tradition. I would mention them in detail, but with the aim of not spoiling the reader, I shall only say that, if they have watched UC beforehand, they are into a treat, especially if they have gotten tired of a certain annoying cliché involving potential love interests.<br />
In addition to this, and despite its early cancellation, the show manages to tie its plot points very effectively and creatively.<br />
<br />

The music is astounding, especially for a 90s anime series steming from a long-running metaseries like Gundam. X&#039;s predecessor, Gundam Wing, had a very, very neat soundtrack, one pf the best of the franchise in my opinion: but Gundam X manages to get to its level, if not surpass it, in some cases. The opening and ending themes are absolutely beautiful, which makes one wonder why Romantic Mode&#039;s career did not continue; the rest of the instrumental sountrack is feature film-level of goodness. You can tell they really put effort in composition and execution when it came to Gundam X&#039;s soundtrack. Whether it&#039;s a sad track, a sweet track, or an epic, battle-inspirational track, it hits the nail.<br />
<br />
I would also like to address UC fans to tell them that this is the best way to introduce someone to Gundam and lead them to UC tradition: whereas Gundam Wing only revels in action and randomness most of the time, X actually attempts to be a fully good series, and it succeeds. Add to the fact that both UC and AW (After War) have practically some of the same concepts (Gundam X is the only Alternate Universe that has Newtypes), it&#039;s more suitable for someone who is reluctant to introduce a newcomer to Gundam due to the dated animation of 0079 or the incoherences of Wing.<br />
<br />
The series isn&#039;t without flaws, though: the mechanical designs, while effective, ironically do not seem to be very original and seem more like Wing/UC hybrid rejects (although I will point out that the Virsargo and Ashtaron are some of the exceptions), and some people might not initially buy just how jolly and normal everyone seems to live in an post-apocalyptic world (although, serving as devil&#039;s advocate here: Gundam has never handled &quot;apocalyptic scenarios&quot; quite well in my opinoin), and the final arc is very, very, very rushed, despite concluding, ironically, quite effectively.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is my favorite Gundam series. I guess my tastes may be too generic for the more &quot;expert&quot; viewers or something, but I have no regrets. Gundam X is my ideal Gundam series. And I highly recommend it to anyone, newcomer or veteran viewer, of the franchise, and anime as a whole.

    So, this is one &quot;Gundam&quot; anime that I have never seen before I just finished this about twenty minutes ago. And I have never seen a gundam anime that had put so much detail or information in the word &quot;newtype&quot; or wanting to find out more about what they are, and what their exact role or purpose in this life is. Through out their many adventures, and up until towards the very end, both before and during the final battle, are they finally able to learn the truth, that has to do with the existence of newtypes, both friend and foe alike are able to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376312">
        learn this information. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and understand why, this is such an underated gem. Although short, it packs a lot of detail into a short, but worth while anime. I actually did take my time finishing it, as to not rush through it, and end up missing the smallest, yet most important of details.

    I found the other user&#039;s comments interesting how much they rated Gundam X very optimistically.<br />
Myself, when I first watched the series, in 2016 (and it was the first TV series in the Gundam franchise that I watched, having only seen Gundam 08th Team before), my assessment was much better than the current one.<br />
Reviewing the series, however, it became easier to understand why the series was canceled and was practically forgotten by Sunrise after it ended (they basically published a spin-off manga, and remembered the series in Gundam Build Fighters, but nothing more) .<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
It didn&#039;t have a clear direction. In the beginning, it was basically

          <span style="display: none;" id="review374991">
        Frieden looking for Newtypes, with the Frost brothers getting in the way, almost as if it were the Pokémon&#039;s Team Rocket. Apparently the TV Asahi&#039;s audience did not like the idea, and in the middle of the serie they returned to the formula that enshrined the franchise: a political plot. But then it was too late.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
The character design is very reminiscent of that of Gundam Wing. Art as a whole is not bad, but for a 1996 anime, I expected more. In fact, the animation techniques used differ little from the 1979 series, with some innovations (several of them already coming from Gundam Wing), but nothing that enhances the art as a whole.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
The soundtrack works well, but it is noticeably less than Gundam Wing. It is a little striking trail, and its presence is sometimes ignored.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
Ran Garrod is the opposite extreme of Heero Yuy, and is just a little more interesting than Amuro Ray. In the beginning, his personality bothered him, but by the end of the anime, this was partially corrected, but enough to make him more nice.<br />
Tiffa Adill doesn&#039;t have the same appeal as Relena Peacecraft, and apart from her skills, she adds little to the group. She only got more interesting in the end, when she took over her relationship with Ran Garrod.<br />
Jamil Neat is the most interesting character in this series. With an antagonistic look, he is a serious character, but one with good feelings. His backstory is interesting, and it praises the character.<br />
Sara, Tonya, Shingo and Dr. Techs are good support characters.<br />
Witz and Roby don&#039;t like it very much at the beginning, but they improve during the series.<br />
Enil El at first reminds Yubel of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX. But it seems that she did not please the audience of TV Asahi, and was somewhat out of place for the rest of the series, ending up as one of the group&#039;s allies at the end, which was not exactly convincing.<br />
Brothers Shagia and Olba Frost are the most boring characters in the series. Their antagonism is fragile and not justified, and they are more annoying than adding to the story. It basically reminded me of the essence of the Pokémon&#039;s Team Rocket. They make a mess, but when the situation gets complicated, they just run away. They are futile and irritating.<br />
<br />
It is important to highlight how much trouble Hajime Yatate has in creating non-Japanese names. But this is a defect of Yoshiyuki Tomino himself.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10<br />
Gundam X takes time to get interesting, but when it does, the story needs to end, because the series was canceled in episode 39, and it didn&#039;t win 4 episodes like it happened with Gundam 0079. Following the series was not a pain, but Gundam Wing was good more interesting. At least, unlike Gundam Wing, the dialogues are not so philosophical, which makes the series easier to follow.<br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10<br />
Overall, Gundam X tries to be interesting, but comes up against unfriendly characters, boring villains, and a story that only evolves in the second half of the series, but still with reservations. It recalls the essence of Gundam 0079, but the hasty ending really spoils the series, negating a concept from UC (which was being better explored), and basically contradicting the plot itself. Alone, Gundam X is not terrible, but whoever watched Gundam 0079 and some other series in the franchise (like Gundam Wing) will really realize how much the series is inferior, and how much it was canceled in episode 39 was understandable.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    A show that offers so much yet very few take up that offer. It strays away from previous Gundams in all the right areas and delivers a unique, touching, captivating experience. While it&#039;s not my favorite Gundam, I would definitely place it in my top 5 and is an easy recommendation. To offer up a brief history, this show was the third in the trio of Gundam shows during the 90s that were placed in Alternate Universes (the other two being G Gundam and Gundam Wing).  It was cancelled midway through its run which is why it has an odd 39 episodes instead of

        the normal ~50 episode runtime Gundam shows usually run. However, the writing in this series is great and you won&#039;t even notice that it was cut short, the show wraps everything up and ends smoothly. <br />
<br />
Animation(8/10): The animation is similar to Wing and G Gundam so it&#039;s not going to be breathtaking but it does it&#039;s job and you won&#039;t be distracted. There are also little repeats of footage and for the most part the animation of fluid. <br />
<br />
Sound/Music(9/10): I really really like the soundtrack for this show, all the openings and endings are excellent and really set the mood, as well as the final song  to end the series. The sound effects are typical of a Gundam show so no problems there. The only complaint I have is the intermission sound can be a little distracting because it&#039;s a more energetic sound and often comes right after a very dramatic moment, which causes some clashing. <br />
<br />
Character(10/10): As with any Gundam show, it&#039;s the characters that make or break it. What I love about the characters here is that they are actually likeable and relateable, unlike many gundam characters. Garrod is an awesome protagonist, he&#039;s energetic, crafty, skillful, and he grows throughout the series in both skill and maturity. What I like about Garrod though is that he never lets anything get him down, he always charges forward and is a very strong character. Tiffa is the main female protagonist and while quiet and mysterious at first, she matures greatly and breaks out of her shell becoming another great and strong character. Jamil is the &quot;char&quot; analog and is a badass. He&#039;s the captain of the ship the characters travel on and is very likeable and you have his respect basically from the beginning. The rest of the characters are all deep, complex, relateable, and just a joy to watch. You won&#039;t find angst or depression in these characters.<br />
<br />
Story(7/10): The story here is a little weak. It focuses heavily on Newtypes and jumps around a lot. Alot of times you feel like the characters are going nowhere, fighting in random battles for no point, and overall lost. While the direction of the story can be confusing the actual plot and interactions between characters and elements is still well done and you won&#039;t be bored. The story also picks up rapidly towards the end (due in fact to the cancellation) and the last 10 episodes are a fun ride. <br />
<br />
Overall(8/10): Overall a great show both as a part of and independent of the Gundam franchise. I loved the hopeful tone and optimism the show radiated, especially after watching the depression that was Victory Gundam and the seriousness that was Wing. The show, while not groundbreaking, does do nearly everything right and deserves its place in the Gundamverse. I highly recommend it.

    Sunrise and yet another Gundam product of the 1990’s along with long time director Shinji Takamatsu (School Rumble, Gintama). Too bad this anime was cut short from the 50 episode mark to 39. This was due to the underwhelming lack of views after the already low mark from the first 10 episodes.<br />
<br />
Gundam X is set 15 years after a devastating war ravaged mankind causing inevitably a colony dropping on Earth. Already, there is a plot from the original Gundam series but set after the war focusing on the remnants and after effects of it all. A great idea with a fantastic set up, but poorly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218549">
        executed. Remember, the original series was canceled too.<br />
<br />
The remains of the two factions, Federation and Space Revolutionary Army, try to reclaim the power they once had. In the case of the Federation, they try to unite Earth again and wage war against space, again. Needless to say, this is the focus of 90 percent of the anime due to cancelation causing the space part only being the last bits. <br />
<br />
As the plot is usually slow and character grinding, the main characters of Garrod (pilot) and Tiffa (newtype) along with the rest of the Gundam X cast are incredibly archetyped by the plot and filled with too much over dramatizing and teenage angst on top of it all. It gets to the point of suffering, predictability, and the worst offender of all, re-hashing. Everything from fight scenes to “romantic” developments are constantly re-hashed and not to mention the worst villain(s) to ever come out of a Gundam series. Characters in Gundam X are so blank and insufferable it is no wonder the anime got cut.<br />
<br />
Music and art are slightly above average for the time in the mid-90s. Although, consistent re-hashing of fight scenes and fast paces low pitched music create a less impressive overall look to the anime. Really, nothing memorable animation or music wise tends to stand out.<br />
<br />
Gundam X has been called a sleeper mech and under appreciated, but a good idea and great setting can’t make up for bland characters and bland execution.

    Now when a series starts delving into alternate universes, how close they’ll be to the original will vary from series to series. Some will be pretty close, others will have so little to do with it that had it not been for some recurring elements, you wouldn’t be able to tell they were from the same franchise. Gundam X falls very clearly into the former, with it more or less being just a “What if” take on the UC. Namely… what if the One Year War led to the end of the world? That, my friends, is the basic premise of After War Gundam X.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
As

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309116">
        said, before, this is basically just an alternate future of the UC, and as such, many different themes and elements are tackled, even if their naming may be different (Like Cyber-Newtypes being called Artificial Newtypes). It’s actually kinda nice, as it gives the show a bit of a back to basics sort of feel, which the franchise probably needed by this point. In turn, it’s a bit of a Reconstruction of those themes, featuring them in a slightly different light than before, one which highlights their positives and their negatives.<br />
<br />
In turn, the show also has a very simple arc based structure, with each story arc being their own movie of sorts depending on how you look at it. The quality of them is also almost always great, and even the worse ones aren’t bad, just a bit boring at times. Ironically, my favorite episode ended up being the show’s one and only “Filler” episode, which just never fails to crack me up, and the episode itself is a fantastic one and done story.<br />
<br />
That said, there is a problem. Due to a combination of factors (Awful timeslot, fourth Gundam series in a row without breaks, yet another alternate timeline) the show ended up being cut short, forcing the writers to rearrange the last 10 or so episodes to compliment this. Now, don’t get me wrong, the plot in these episodes is still great, it’s just that compared to what came before, it falls flat. Still though, I don’t think that’s enough to ruin the whole show, far from it.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
It’s these that make the show shine. Garrod is a bit different from other Gundam protagonist. Not only does he have no special traits (Which becomes an actual plot point in the finale), but his main issue is that unlike previous Gundam protagonists who were angsty and moody, Garrod is more like Judau from ZZ. The kid means well, he’s just extremely socially awkward, which leads to him making a lot of mistakes early on.<br />
<br />
His co-stars Tifa and Jamil do a good job at complementing him. Tifa is even more socially awkward than him, and is basically an Ayanami Rei Clone personality-wise, at least in the surface. She does get over this eventually, but it’ll be a while before the girl speaks more than a few sentences per episodes. Her relationship with Garrod is also adorable. Jamil by contrast is what would happen if you threw the Zeta-Era versions of Char, Amuro and Bright in a blender and added sideburns, which makes for an exquisite combination.<br />
<br />
The rest of the sidecast does a great job at being relevant too. Witz and Toniya ended up being my favorites of the lot, with their constant bickering never failing to crack me up. But there’s also Roybea and the total ladies’ man he is, Sara and her seemingly unrequited crush on Jamil, Ennil and her consistent desire to kill Garrod (She has a good reason for being like that) and Techs, the greatest doctor in Gundam history. Of course, there are also the two main villains, the Frost Brothers, and while Olba is a bit annoying (Even his voice actor doesn’t like him) both serve as effective, if petty, antagonists.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
For the most part the show looks good, but not much more than that. It’s an upgrade from Wing as it doesn’t use stock footage as often, but it never manages to look as good as G or Victory did at points. That said, it is a good looking show, just not a particularly great looking one.<br />
<br />
The Mecha:<br />
<br />
The selection of mecha here is pretty great. The Gundam X and its upgrade the X Divider are both really good looking, with me having a slight preference towards the latter. The Airmaster (Burst) and the Leopard (Destroy) are both also great in their own right. The Virsago (Chest Break) is pretty nice, though I didn’t particularly care for the Ashtaron (Hermit Crab). Finally is the Gundam Double X, one of, if not the, best mid-season upgrades in the whole franchise. So yeah, I have to wonder why they didn’t sell well.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is great. Many themes can be calm or atmospheric, but there are also a lot of more action packed themes that fit the tone of the show just as well. As for the Openings and Endings, I liked all of them  (Especially “Dreams” and  “Silver Horizon”) bar the Japanese Version of Human Touch, which just never quite clicked with me for some reason.<br />
<br />
Voice Acting:<br />
<br />
The cast is pretty good. Takagi Wataru steps up as Garrod using one of his lighter voices, and it fits Garrod quite well. Kanai Mika, in turn, plays totally against type as the extremely shy Tifa, and does a surprisingly good job. In turn, UC veteran Horiuchi Kenyuu comes in as Jamil, bringing his whole schitck full circle. Also of note are Nakai Kazuya and Kakazu Yumi, both of whom had their debuts in this show and did a great job, even if Kakazu completely goes against type given how stoic and professional Sara often is. And that’s not all, there’s also Morikawa Toshiyuki, Mitsuishi Kotono, Hidaka Narumi, Sasaki Nozomu, Yamazaki Takumi, Touma Yumi, Katsuki Masako, Chiba Isshin, Yusa Koji and the Late Great Mizutani Yuko, who goes completely against type playing a young boy, no less.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Gundam X is a great show, and it pains me it didn’t do as well as it deserves. Still though, I don’t blame it on the show itself, but rather on Sunrise and their shitty decision-making skills. Thankfully the show has picked up a cult following, even if its somewhat unknown by Gundam standards. If you haven’t seen it yet, I highly recommend doing so, though I‘d recommend you first watch some UC series first, as then the continuity gags will become all the more satisfying.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 9/10

    The sun shines a crimson glow on the horizon. All we see in front of us are the wastes, the remnants of a world that once was. The effects of war have stained the planet and now all that is left are us and very drops of hope left. Here we go, storing those droplets of hope as we walk towards an uncertain future.<br />
<br />
The 1990s is considered by some to be the golden age of the Gundam Franchise. Coming off of successful entries such as 0080 and 08th team, the people at Bandai thought about expanding their property beyond the Universal Century Timeline. The fruits

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295682">
        of this expansion were G Gundam, Gundam Wing, and After War Gundam X. After War is a reimaging of the One Year War if there was no Amuro or Char who existed. It takes place on a barren Earth, riddled with crime and debris. The damage that the One Year War had done on the planet can be seen from the very first episode. We are introduced to what seems like a young mercenary, Garrod Ran, taking on a mission to rescue a mysterious girl from a band of thugs. Little did he know that the girl was a newtype, a type of human being with psychic(or supernatural powers depending on the situation) and the fate of the world rests in the hands of these newtypes.<br />
<br />
The new type portion of all Gundam shows has always been very divisive, starting with its almost random inclusion towards the end of the original Gundam. This both to the show&#039;s advantage and detriment. Symbolically, Newtypes have always represented humanity&#039;s ability to create meaningful connections on a spiritual level. To look past political differences, skin color and to see what humans are on a fundamental level. However, newtypes are abused and used for immoral purposes throughout the Gundam franchise. After War X is not an exception to this tradition. The major failing of the newtype in X has to be how the psychic abilities of newtypes are exaggerated to a point of disbelief. Say what you will about Tomino but he always made it clear what Newtypes are capable of. In X, Newtypes are essentially gods on this earth. They talk to the dead, communicate with animals(some animals are newtypes apparently) and all sorts of crazy things. <br />
<br />
The episodic structure is similar to Gundams of past. They follow a strict formula: idle chatting -&gt; philosophical debates -&gt; mission introduced -&gt; battle -&gt; post battle reflection. If you found other Gundams to be a chore to watch, this won&#039;t change your opinion. Where After succeeds, is in the moments of reflection. The characters cast their eyes upon a dying world and try to find the reason why they fight. Some may fight for love, to escape their past, or to fight for a better future. It is in these moments, that After War becomes something special. The show has its flaws but there is a genuine warmth and tenderness lying at the center of each episode that is greatly appreciated. And interestingly this series in conversation with Tomino&#039;s prior Gundam entries. Gundam has always been a dialogue between cynicism and hope. Gundam&#039;s creator, Yoshiyuki Tomino, often times sided with cynicism and it showed in his story choices and directorial style. X adds a lot to the dialectic, often times directly challenging Gundam&#039;s creator in subtle ways. &quot;Why don&#039;t you have hope in humanity!?&quot; &quot;There is going to be a better future for us.&quot; seemed to be aimed at Mr. Tomino itself. That is one thing I have always loved about Gundam, more specifically the universal century timeline, each entry was in dialogue with each other. That is something that made Gundam head and shoulders above its competition.<br />
<br />
We all know the saying, &quot;all that glitters is not gold&quot; and applies to this series as well. It suffers from plodding pacing at certain points, and it was cut short of several episodes. These episodes were direly needed to make the show complete from both a narrative and thematic perspective. Long plot arcs are cut short to unsatisfying conclusions, leaving you with metaphorical blue balls. And the ending is the only seemingly contrived portion of the show due to its length. The warmth and kindness seem hamfisted and rather patronizing here. <br />
<br />
There were also some character issues here as well. Our protagonist, Garrod Ran, is a rather underwhelming protagonist. Coming from the Gundam tradition of angsty, psychologically damaged Gundam pilots Garrod is rather milquetoast. There is nothing about him that makes him stand out from your average, run of the mill, good guy protagonist. However, what the show lacks in its protagonist, it more than makes up for in its supporting cast. Characters like the lovable mercenaries turned good guys, Roybea and Witz, is when the Gundam character tradition comes into play. They are both likable but with interesting backstories that affect everything they do. The show would have been much better if Garrod was not the main character and these two became the focus instead. Jamil Neate, the protagonist of the ship is a veteran with PTSD from the one year war. His beliefs and his guilt for his war crimes make him a pretty compelling character in his own right. The show is also lacking in the villain category. The villains, the frost brothers are two of the most boring villains in Gundam history. They lack the sociopathy of Scirocco, the wittiness, and sensuality of Haman. They are just there to seemingly make the plot move forward.<br />
<br />
After War Gundam X is a Gundam left to the annals of history. Overshadowed by its more popular and retarded brother, Gundam Wing. It is also a case of missed potential and if it wasn&#039;t cut 12 episodes short I know it would have been a good, dare I say great entry in the Gundam franchise. <br />
<br />
And now the sun slowly sets upon our world. Our journey was drastically cut short yet we still carry the warmth and heart of the human spirit with us. <br />

    Gundam X got a bad reputation due to the bad timing where it was aired along with Shin Seiki Evangelion which got a big hits and Gundam X was somehow forgotten. But, personally I think the anime is quite good and has some uniqueness that makes me can&#039;t forget it... and V Gundam anime was even worse.

After War Gundam X fits into a strange category of being separate from the Universal Century timeline, yet it&#039;s told in a way that mainly appeals to fans of it. I guess in that regard, its similar to Turn A Gundam. Both Turn A and Gundam X are essentially alternate universe conclusions to many of the prior anime in the franchise. In my opinion, Gundam X is slightly more accessible to new viewers whereas watching Turn A wouldn&#039;t make a whole lot of sense considering most view it as development of it&#039;s original creator and not just a standalone story. The only thing you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396024">
        really need to know about Gundam in order to understand X is what Newtypes are, and that&#039;s a very simple explanation. Newtypes, are humans born in outer space with an extra sense that gives them psychic abilities. Depending on what series you watch, Newtypes could be symbolic of the empathy and unity required for the advancement of our species, or just crazy powers that can sometimes make mechs go ultra instinct. Personally, I&#039;m a fan of the symbolism, but when it starts to expend beyond clairvoyance, ya lose me, the mechs are already enough. Thankfully, Gundam X features one of the best implementations of Newtypes I&#039;ve seen, so it wasn&#039;t a deterrent for me. Now that you know about Newtypes, lets move onto the story. The setting of Gundam X is easily one of my favorites from the entire franchise. It takes place in a UC alternate universe where the war took a catastrophic turn as numerous space colonies crashed down to earth, extinguishing 10 billion lives. 15 years later, new cities have been built and humanity is beginning to thrive once again. Although the war is over, life isn&#039;t without its struggles thanks to raiders pillaging their towns using scavenged mobile suits. Think of Gundam X as Mad Max with mechs because you have raiders or vagabonds behind the wheel of massive armored vehicles going to war with each other over discarded military equipment. The story follows Garrod a 15 year old boy who lived most of his life fending for himself and thought his years he&#039;s honed the skills necessary to survive. Basically speaking, he&#039;s a badass who can walk right up to your mobile suit and kick you out of its cockpit. Though Garrod has the experience to make money piloting mobile suits, he prefers to sell them and live a quiet, solitary life. One day, Garrod&#039;s lonesome existence is turned upside down by a mission to rescue a young girl, Tiffa from her kidnappers. As the plot thickens, he discovers that his contractor is the real villain and the supposed kidnappers were the ones who actually saved her. This event becomes the catalyst that throws the story into motion as Garrod reluctantly joins the Freeden, a hover vessel filled with scavengers commanded by the infamous war hero, Jamil. Jamil&#039;s goal is to travel the world freeing Newtypes who&#039;re enslaved or manipulated for their powers as well as extinguish any remaining embers of the past war. I appreciated the variety of the antagonists in Gundam X because it displayed a believable post war, apocalyptic environment. Some fought for profit, some for survival, and others, simply because ending the war didn&#039;t end the mentality that created it in the first place. There&#039;s always the risk of starting new wars for old reasons. Each era of Gundam anime is slightly different from the last. In the 80s, Gundam was an abysmal look into the horrors of war. They developed their characters well, then had them brutally murdered leaving the survivors with traumatic scars that will never heal. In the 90&#039;s the mainline series shifted its gaze away for cool mechs and exciting battles to became the main focal point. Gundam X is kinda like the best of both worlds because it shares much of the same creative talent as Gundam Wing, so the mechs are awesome and the battles are exciting. It also manages to incorporate one of the more palatable anti-war themes the franchise has to offer. I know war is bad, everyone knows it, but sometimes it feels like the morals in Gundam outweigh the viewer experience, and it becomes emotionally exhaustive. Gundam X on the other hand takes a much more balanced approach to war by primarily displaying how our differences are superficial and can sometimes be set aside for the sake of peace. This is a crucial element for plot progression because some of the antagonists eventually become allies. Which ones? I won&#039;t show or tell, because that&#039;s a spoiler. What I will say is that some of these baddies get great development, and can really win you over. However, we aren&#039;t so lucky to have all of the antagonist be so dynamic, some of them are sadly one dimensional cartoon villains. Despite some of its annoying villains, I think Gundam X makes up for it by having so many likable characters who actually receive development. I&#039;d consider many of the characters and their interactions with each other to be in my top 20 of the franchise. I thought Garrod had an interesting backstory of growing up alone in this post apocalyptic world. This negatively impacted his interactions with the freeden crew, because he&#039;s used to being a lone wolf and teamwork isn&#039;t in his wheelhouse. The growing love between Garrod and Tiffa was also enjoyable as it was innocent and heartwarming. Jamil is basically their version of Armuro Rey who took an incredibly dark turn. Although it sounds like he should be the powerhouse who negates any threat, he struggles to pilot a mobile suit due to his debilitating PTSD. I also enjoyed Sou and Roy, two mercenaries hired by Jamil. They appear to be pretty bland at first due to their guarded personalities, but they really open up in the second half and actually become my two favorite characters. Gundam X equally develops like 10 characters, and in the end, I liked them all, even though I initially disliked half of them. I&#039;d argue that Gundam X tried to develop far too many characters, in doing so it sacrificed the character depth that could have otherwise been achieved. I like the direction they took, but there&#039;s not a single character that I thought couldn&#039;t be developed more. Aesthetically speaking, Gundam X clearly falls in line with the other 50 episode Gundam anime from the 90s. I mostly compare it to Gundam Wing considering it was created months later and shared many of it&#039;s creative talents such as mech designers, character designer, and animation directors. I loved how they integrated mech designs from previous anime with a twist. It&#039;s easy to see how some mobile suits were heavily inspired by Zaku, Qubeley, or various mobile suits from Gundam Wing. I really appreciated the level of creativity featured in these mobile suits. It&#039;s just a shame that the series isnt long enough for them to all be appreciated. The GX-9901 has a unique feature because it&#039;s one of the few Gundams equipped with a weapon of mass destruction. It&#039;s got these solar pannel looking things on it&#039;s back that unfold to collect radiation that&#039;s beamed down to earth from the moon. It basically just deletes everything in its path. I thought this was pretty cool, but it&#039;s kinda conflicting when a show features such strong anti-war themes, but the protagonist evaporates hundreds of people with the press of a button, but I guess that&#039;s the cost of war, you cant make friends with everyone. The animation is also what you&#039;d expect for a 90&#039;s Gundam, but in my opinion it&#039;s much better than Wing because it didn&#039;t re-use footage as often. At most they recycled some attack animations. Although the battles weren&#039;t as intense or gritty as 08th MS Team, I don&#039;t hold that against it because I see them both as being two different brands of Gundam and two different tiers of production quality. Gundam X is more about fast paced action, lots of explosions, and mobile suits flying around and cutting each other in half. Typically in Gundam anime, mobile suits get 1 upgrade and that&#039;s it. Gundam X utilizes it&#039;s post apocalyptic setting by incrementally upgrading it&#039;s mobile suits which added a nice touch considering all the spare parts they must have lying around on a salvage ship. I felt this was another factor in keeping the fights feeling fresh. The main problem I have with Gundam X is that it&#039;s a little too ambitious and it&#039;s structured in a way that risks representing good ideas poorly which turn people off before they understand what they&#039;re even watching. After watching 08th MS Team last week, I wanted to drop Gundam X around 10 episodes in. Of course I finished it, but I wasnt that impressed. After a day of letting the anime sink in, I realized that I misunderstood it, and didnt give it a fair chance, so I started over and enjoyed it much more my second time around. I believe my initial dissatisfaction was not a unique experience. Even the Japanese lost interest which caused it to be cut short by 11 episodes. Although it has a pretty good ending, it&#039;s easy to see the pacing is ramped up during the final arc. I believe if it had better written villains and more thorough planning then they would have enticed more people to see it through to the end. My initial impressions were that the series was nothing but a bunch of bland characters and rescue missions. Afterall, Tifa gets kidnapped like 6 times. Although the plot progression and a few shallow villains are undeniable shortcomings, The character development becomes a casualty because the aforementioned flaws tend to eat away at your patience, resulting in overlooking the development that&#039;s already there. Many had a similar problem with Cowboy Bebop because it also uses a slow, but gradual characterization method. The difference is that Bebop has a much more exciting and diverse plot with fewer long long term characters that featured a staggered introduction. Gundam X on the other hand dumps most of it&#039;s characters in your lap in the first few episodes and uses a development format similar painting a wall, one evenly distributed microscopic layer every few hours. Due to this, it&#039;s easy to confuse its abundance of slowly developing characters with boring characters. I remember the exact moment when I realized that the cast was more complex than I had given them credit for, that was episode 15 which is devoted to Roy and Sou. Up until this point, I thought they were just background characters. However, they&#039;re just hired mercenaries in a post apocalyptic world. Why would they trust their employers enough to open up? Episode 15 focuses on them away from the Freeden, when they can truly become their self and it&#039;s easily my favorite episode in the anime. I can&#039;t blame people for dropping Gundam X after 10 episodes, and especially for not wanting to rewatch an anime they didn&#039;t like. All I can do is properly set your expectations so that you can appreciate the anime for what it is. I think if you set your expectations at the level of other 90s Gundam TV series like G-Gundam, Wing, and even Turn A, then you&#039;ll be impressed. Overall, After War Gundam X is an uncut gem that I&#039;d love to see remade as a much longer anime. It&#039;s a slow burn that&#039;s not going to be for everyone, but if you&#039;re patient and open minded enough, then I think it&#039;s a great experience especially if you&#039;re a fan of Gundam Wing or Universal Century. I give Gundam X an 8/10. This is just the script from my youtube review. Hope you found it helpful

    X marks the spot...to catch a pretty decent mecha anime.<br />
<br />
I have to applaud Sunrise for doing something a little out of character for them. Their primary focus was putting on the display of human misunderstanding and when that misunderstanding escalates to war and suffering. Of course, while prior and latter Gundam series have had a similar focus, I haven&#039;t seen it become the overwhelming theme like it was in this series. Even the mecha battles were pushed aside for this theme.<br />
<br />
The plot surrounds a 15-year-old orphan named Garrod Ran, who through a set of circumstances meets Tiffa Adill, a girl the same age that is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review83309">
        believed to have Newtype powers and many people are trying to get their hands on that power. Through saving Tiffa, Garrod gets his hands on a Gundam GX-9900, also known as the Gundam X, and their adventure takes off from there. Overall, I found the plot and story to be decent. It&#039;s a pretty typical plot for a Gundam anime, but what separates it from it&#039;s predecessors and it&#039;s followers is its overwhelming themes of human misunderstanding and trying to solve the problems caused by those misunderstandings.<br />
<br />
The characters were some of the most likable I had seen in a Gundam series. Garrod is ambitious and believes strongly in his ideals, much like his predecessors. One thing that does separate him though is he&#039;s a quirky character with a pretty good sense of humor. He&#039;s a bit more crafty than his predecessors. He doesn&#039;t really have any &quot;emo&quot; moments and honestly, I found his character to be much closer to that of a teenager than the likes of Amuro Ray, Kamille Bidan, Judau Ashta, Heero Yuy, Kira Yamato, Setsuna F. Sei (essentially enter any Gundam pilot here). Another nice thing about him in comparison is, he doesn&#039;t have any supernatural Coordinator/Newtype powers. He&#039;s just a normal kid who&#039;s good at adjusting to his surroundings while operating a Gundam. Tiffa is one of the more adorable Gundam heroines I&#039;ve seen in a series. It seems as though her thoughts are pure while it seems a great deal of her focus is put toward her power. I will admit, it does cause a pretty obvious lack of character from her, but wasn&#039;t enough to detract from the quality of the series. My biggest complaint is that there is very little character development, especially with the two leads Garrod and Tiffa. We learn next to nothing about their history other than their parents are dead. I understand that these characters are living in the moment and not in their past, but it would&#039;ve been nice to know a little more as to why they are the way they are. Of course, I do also believe their lack of development is somewhat linked to the theme of the series...they are two of the few characters that aren&#039;t living in the past and are instead looking toward a future. The supporting characters and antagonists also suffer from the same problems. There really isn&#039;t that much development about them and we&#039;re supposed to learn about their characters through their interactions with each other and minor exposition dumps explaining their motives. The antagonists themselves were actually rather weak in comparison to many other Gundam series, but then again, even they are considered to be the products of human misunderstanding rather than being inherently evil themselves. <br />
<br />
I do think the weakest aspect of this series is the editing. For a Sunrise produced Gundam series, the editing was extremely lackluster. There were moments where the OP and midway points of the episode would jump-scare me. There was even a tender moment later on in the series that essentially got blown up by the blaring music and the black &quot;After War Gundam X&quot; title card that COMPLETELY spoiled the mood. As I mentioned before, the episodes would start out usually showing flashbacks of prior episodes or early plot setup for the next small arc in the story and then the OP would come blaring in out of nowhere. I swear to God, it&#039;s like the people at Sunrise have never heard of a fade transition before. On top of that, and this goes back to the writing, I found Gundam X to be strangely paced. The first 25 episodes or so have a rather slow pace, seemingly taking a while to build up to what the plot is really about. The last 14 episodes or so felt somewhat rushed. Of course, that&#039;s because the last 1/3 was focused more on war while the first 2/3 of the series was focused more on Earth and it&#039;s after effects of war. This does go back to character development a little bit, but I wish the producers would&#039;ve toned it down a bit with it&#039;s narration and focused more on character. Now that I think about it, this series had a lot more narration than most other Gundam series and I&#039;ll admit, most of it was unnecessary and felt like episode filler. All-in-all, this was pretty lousy production work from Sunrise.<br />
<br />
Overall, it does sadden me that Sunrise butchered this a bit with it&#039;s production, because I found that in regards to plot and characters, this was actually one of the better Gundam series. I will come out and say Garrod is probably my favorite lead character in any of the Gundam animated series and I found the supporting characters to be pretty good as well. However, it&#039;s obvious what sets this series apart from the others and that&#039;s the message of the story. I found the message to be much more profound and focused than other Gundam series. I know the &quot;moral of the story&quot; is a pretty overused cliche, especially when it comes to storytelling but I found the &quot;moral&quot; of Gundam X to be much better than it&#039;s predecessors and it&#039;s followers. If you&#039;re a fan of the Gundam series, I do recommend giving this a watch. Despite the many flaws, the message in itself makes it at least worth of a watch through. <br />
