    There have been many dragonball features, some go from very bad to very good.  this one falls on the latter as probably one of, if not the best one ever.  WHat makes this feature so great is it is just so enjoyable to watch. you can see this many times and it will not get old.  Broly is a great villain.  He is the very definition of what a super sayin should be. powerful, destructive and completely psychotic.  Broly stops at nothing to defeat Goku and his friends.  The story line is also very enjoyable   overall this

    Welcome to the complete and utter letdown that is Broly. For a non-canonical character, Broly receives a massive amount of praise. People often cite this movie to be the best DBZ film. Not only is Broly not the best DBZ film, Broly is just plain bad.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have nostalgia for DBZ. If you do feel free to put your hands over your ears and exit the review. I first watched DBZ (as well as the original Dragon Ball) in 2015. I loved Dragon Ball and DBZ was great as well, albeit with a lot of faults. So I do enjoy the series a lot.<br />
<br />
The main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224710">
        issue with the movie is Broly. Broly represents everything that was creatively wrong in DBZ. He shows up and is completely invincible until time is running out on the feature. Most of this movie is the Dragon Ball Z trope of Goku and friends getting their butts kicked until (literally) the final 5 minutes of the movie. It&#039;s not even a back and forth affair. For some this makes Broly a cool bad ass. For the rest of us, we see it for what it is. It&#039;s the same played out lazy fight scene Dragon Ball Z thrived on, except this time it monopolizes a feature length film.<br />
<br />
Broly&#039;s backstory isn&#039;t special either. I am certainly glad they explained how another Saiyan is wondering around, but that doesn&#039;t make it intriguing. I think the movie wanted you to feel for him a bit, but then it switches back to Broly in the present time acting what I would describe as foolish and you feel nothing. Broly has nothing interesting about him. He is just a goofy monster.<br />
<br />
Should you watch this movie? Of course. It&#039;s part of DBZ history. A lot of people love it and you need to at least give it a watch. Just be ready, because this movie movie will let you down.

    I was waiting too long to see Broly in action, after all, he is one of the main reasons that made me rewatch the entire DB series this year.<br />
<br />
The movie didn&#039;t disappoint. Broly is a fearless monster with no fellings at all, the true essence of any saiya-jin warrior. As the story goes, Goku gets to fight against him and, in my opinion, this was one of his toughest battles, since Broly had unlimited power, besides being a lot stronger.<br />
<br />
As in many other battles, Goku doesn&#039;t give up, even after taking serious damage. He brings hope to everyone when everything seems lost and keeps fighting,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review94537">
        even if it costs his own life.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t recall watching any of Broly&#039;s movies when I was a kid, so this was really worth of my time. Seeing him for the first time was incredible and I can&#039;t wait to watch his other movies.

    This is the best dbz movie ever made, this movie had the best dbz villian and it is well written and hands down it had one of the best english soundtracks. Broly will forever be my favorite dbz villian, he is very overpowered and strikes a lot of fear into his victims, his behavior is more ruthless than the new dragonball super broly, i definitely prefer this version even though its non canon. I still enjoy watching it over, i still feel like broly should have been a canon character in the dbz anime. Its the best movie in the broly trilogy 100%

    While definately not the best movie ever, and probably not even the best Dragon Ball Z movie, movie number eight stands up very well as an enjoyable action movie.<br />
The story, such as it is, ostensibly serves simply to deliver action but what story is there works fine. The movie doesn&#039;t drag in any spots too heavily which helps, especially given the movie&#039;s short run time. There are some slightly nonsensical bits that you&#039;ll just have to suspend your disbelief a little more than usual for. Also, the comedy in the movie is not always funny and doesn&#039;t quite add much to the movie. In short,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4885">
        the comedy segments feel shoehorned in a bit and don&#039;t really work to the movie&#039;s favor. However, such segments are brief and don&#039;t totally ruin the movie besides. In its way, this adds the charm of the movie even if it doesn&#039;t quite succeed at being funny. The art is successful and pleasant to look at, as much as the series was. Many familiar faces return as well a couple new ones and all look good. The music in this movie is the usual mix of standard Dragon Ball Z fare, which is good, and the music stands up well. Most of the movie is devoid of music altogether, though, which is a little off-putting but not wholly detrimental. The music is good, there just isn&#039;t much of it in play here. Despite any faults, the movie is good action-packed fun. It moves along at a healthy clip, there is lots of fighting and such action. The ending is a little anti-climatic of a finish for all the rough fighting that there was, though. This was slightly disappointing in that respect. Overall, a good and fun action movie in the Dragon Ball Z fashion.

    This review contains spoilers<br />
<br />
The movie of &quot;Dragon Ball Z Movie 08: Moetsukiro !! Nessen, Ressen, Chougekisen&quot;, is in my humid opinion, entertaining, it is not an excellent film by far, but it fits with the things that I appreciate from a movie of Dragon Ball Z<br />
<br />
The history of the film is, to say the least, interesting. In the movie it shows other 2 warriors of the almost extinct Saiyajin race, the way of presenting them and their motives are very far from the archetype of common enemy (which is not bad), since the first antagonist of the film, Paragus is someone who wants to reconstruct

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280088">
        the whole planet Vegeta, is a goal that, despite sounding outlandish and idiotic, it makes sense if you consider the scenario they were in, Frieza had died and his soldiers too (taking into account that his father died and that, if he became canonical in the film, Cooler, Frieza&#039;s brother had died), they had nothing to lose and everything was conveniently suited for Paragus to carry out his plan.<br />
<br />
Therefore I consider that the motivations of the first villain of the movie are justified and logical, also it is different motivation to the other enemies (although their objectives were false, but by that time they were very good).<br />
<br />
The bad thing is that after the villain changes to the typical &quot;I have a super powerful ally and with the governor the universe&quot;, this type of enemies is too common in the movies and in the very series (except for the Dragon Ball with Goku small), this is passable because the antagonist motive goes to something deeper in Broly&#039;s personality. Broly has a special grudge against Goku and this is due to a big problem they had when they were very young, not because Goku has frustrated their plans or destroyed their ambitions, the problem Broly has with Goku is much more interesting and justifiable than that of other enemies<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
The characters in the film do not stand out, this is because the characters are the same as always, the only &quot;remarkable&quot; new characters are Paragus and Broly.<br />
Goku does not show changes, Vegeta does not, nor does Krillin and a long etcetera. This is not particularly bad since being a franchise film that left many chapters behind it is understandable that it does not have evolution, it would feel very strange and unnatural (although this applies much more in this film for the time and moment in which he left).<br />
<br />
Paragus and Broly are enemies with an interesting story, but it can be easily incoherent, it is assumed that Broly has a power of 10,000 ki, it is only said that he is the legendary super Saiyan and that is never explained, Paragus was not very special and it is very strange that he was the father of the legendary Saiyan, this after all is only a convenience of the author. Broly is saved from a super nova occupied by Frieza and survives with his father because his power was very immense (which I think is a great exaggeration), his story had potential, but was pretty wasted.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the design of Broly, the approaches given by the film, its range of colors and design cohesion in a spectacular way.<br />
As the film always tries to focus on its attacks and muscles to inflict respect (which is very necessary if we take into account that the villain is the legendary Saiyan), even when the film takes up the experiences of Broly the film is about to make it look like a very powerful monster that simply has fun destroying planets (a special scene is like the one that is going to exterminate a small alien race, but instead prefers to change the trajectory of its energy ball to its planet to destroy it in front of all its inhabitants).<br />
<br />
You could say that the range of greenish colors that Broly gives to his attacks and hair is aesthetically good, is very differentiated from the other Saiyans of the series and also when transformed releases a green wave that fits very well to add something epic to the scene<br />
<br />
Its design is something that has much to do with the focus of the camera and the same series gives the character, his design of someone weak and harmless to his muscular design and more evil is spectacular, from the simple as the fact that his pupils are lost until his suit that gives him a mystical air they look good, it can be seen from a distance that he is the legendary super saiyan.<br />
<br />
The bad thing is that Broly does not give off a new or attractive personality, its base form has almost no personality and its form in legendary super saiyan is limited to just saying &quot;Kakaroto&quot; and not much more, it is superb, it is selfish and evil, come on, The aforementioned archetype of the enemy may well suit his personality, but it does not take away the fact that his personality is already very predictable and quite boring. In general Broly was very unused, excellent design, but unfortunate personality.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
The scenarios of the film are basic, they are not surprising nor is it something that fits perfectly with the battle, they are not bad, but they are not good either, you do not feel a very good atmosphere due to the very powerful that they did to Broly reaching seem absurd, although this is easily forgivable because of how the battle was developed on the stage, all the characters being beaten by Broly while he sent it to any building to make them suffer, at least they knew how to use the stage, but it was not perfect (obviously ).<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is fine, personally I love the soundtrack of Dragon Ball in general, in Broly&#039;s film this factor is well used, especially in battles when it is shown how powerful Broly is, this generates a good contrast.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
A little about the end:<br />
At the end of the movie they defeat the antagonist in a very impractical way, the only thing that happened was that Goku asked for energy from the others while giving him a beating (something quite common), at least his power up had a justification, besides creating a scene that can be exciting for some people, seeing Goku defeating Broly is something that is quite disappointing, but this is compensated by the way they focus the punch and see the characters giving Goku the energy despite that they knew they could lose<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
The movie has some inconsistencies; how the fact that the master Mutenroshi has been drunk for about 2 days, Broly&#039;s past or why Paragus left the planet in a very carefree way that caused his death. But if we remove that the film can get to entertain enough, to last an hour takes its time in battles and animation is well implemented with the antagonist Broly, the story, although it has notable failures, is entertaining and can reach generates a great interest for the historical value Saiyan that present the 2 antagonists, scenarios and acceptable soundtracks.

    Even the DBZ Broly movies are extremely enjoyable. Broly is a very good Saiyan and antagonist. He is extremely powerful, reckless, and psychotic. I personally really liked all the Broly movies because he is a great antagonist and I found them very fun and this was no exception.<br />
<br />
So, the story is that the southern galaxy was destroyed and Goku goes to check (yeah it was Broly going apeshit) and Vegeta is called to be the new planet Vegeta king, to which he accepts but soon find out Broly is going nuts and aiming for world domination, the z warriors must beat him and well they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409090">
        do that. 8/10<br />
<br />
The art is like DBZ at the time, the art style is one of my favourites for DB and it looks good. 8/10<br />
<br />
The opening is &quot;Cha La Head Cha La&quot;, I can effortlessly give this a 10/10, the ending is &quot;Burning Fight -Nessen Ressen Chougekisen-&quot;, it reminds me plenty of previous DBZ movie endings for the style. This one is pretty fine but not quite over an 8. Sound is an 8.<br />
<br />
The characters are the usual Z warriors and the rest of the group. Broly might be the definition of a Saiyan and an uncreative villain but I find him to be a good one. He is extremely gifted and strong so everybody tries to control him but Goku and the rest try to become his friend and help him. 8/10<br />
<br />
The movie is pretty cool and one of the best DBZ movies. It is enjoyable and it stars a pretty beloved DB character. 8/10

    I rented this movie for 99 cents last night and both my sister and I were very disappointed with this movie.<br />
We are both big fans of the Dragon Ball Z series and were hoping for a story that would capture what we loved about the series in it&#039;s story and delivery but it did not. The biggest problem was the severely rushed atmosphere of this movie. I do understand that the movie was only an hour long, but if they are going to choose a plot that would say, normally take hours and hours to complete if it were an arc in the series, trying

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33339">
        to fit the story into a one  hour movie did not work for me. My favorite thing about Dragon Ball Z was the slow story-telling, it never tried to jam too much information at once and was always an easy watch, which was one of the things that made the series for me, but the movie was the complete opposite. Still, there were moments that still captured that care-free pace, such as when goku would take time out to just eat himself half to death for a few minutes, or when he was taking time out to be whipped by Chi-chi. Yes, not the most entertaining scenes, but I the shoving of the story down my throat would cease for a few moments during these scenes.<br />
The second biggest problem was the characters personalities, especially Vegeta. Other than a few fleeting moments, it felt like Vegeta&#039;s in your face personality was almost gone completely. There were points were it seemed like everyone was just dragging him around (Literally at one point!) and he had nothing to say about it. I felt like I was watching a Vegeta on anger management drugs, and that&#039;s not the character that I came to love! Then there was the little trio that came along- Trunks, Gohan, and Krillan (and Roshi and Oolong but who cares). Their role was very boring. In fact, I can hardly remember it because it was just... dull. Yes, their little adventure did help uncover the &quot;mystery&quot; of Planet Vegeta and the Legendary Super Saiyan, but it was still unentertaining and the aliens slaves they helped were a COMPLETE eye soar. Yellow and pink put together on a creature that is already hideous was almost eye-searing for me. Goku was at times rather funny as he was in DBZ but it came off too strong several times, I was starting to think Goku got too hungry and happened to eat some happy grass while out in the woods helping some dinosaurs. Roshi and Oolong were as annoying as always and and Chi-chi was as menopausal as ever, king kai was still being the professional peeping tom that he is, and unfortunately due to poor CD quality I missed a portion of Piccolo&#039;s scenes so I can&#039;t speak for him, but all that being said I GUESS the characters balanced out to a decent portrayal of the whole gang. Still, Vegeta being one of my old favorites, I was disappointed about how boring he was even though he was playing a seemingly important role.<br />
Okay, it&#039;s time to address, to put it quite simply, everything else. Yep, all that other stuff. First, the idea of the story wasn&#039;t half bad, and the twists always brought my attention back to the movie right when my interest would begin to stray. It&#039;s just too bad they had so little time to tell it, I think even a half hour more would&#039;ve benefited this movie greatly. The art I was very pleased with. I guess you could say the style was a bit more like the earlier arcs of the Dragon Ball Z series rather than the last one, or two, I don&#039;t remember, but I was also happy about that because I liked the style in the beginning of the DBZ more. The music was okay, but my sister did not like it because she preferred the music in the series and was hoping for something similar. She has pointed out in the past how the music in DBZ was like animation for your ears- for every punch, kick, and throw, the instruments would play something to emphasize it. In this movie, I didn&#039;t pay much attention to whether the music still did that frequently or not, but it did seem that it was just plain soundtracks playing instead when I was listening, and one of the first things she mentioned was that she was not pleased with the music. The new characters weren&#039;t too bad. Paragus was pretty obvious from the very beginning, although I wont say how. I&#039;m not a big fan of lying manipulators, but he played his crappy part well. Broly was a silent type, And interesting because he was more mysterious and he had an oddly different look to him,  his face immediately made me think of the blank, peaceful expression of Android 16, but that&#039;s because he was  hoped up on personality tranquilizers, and I&#039;m not gonna lie, he really needed them! The ending seemed rather abrupt to me. This may have been due to the slight skipping right before the end, but it just didn&#039;t have much flare to me, and gave no sense of accomplishment or satisfaction.<br />
ALRIGHT! Last but certainly not least is the fight scene, one of the most important points of the movie. This may be considered a spoiler, sort of. The big fight scene was.. well, kind of pathetic. My CD was skipping through parts of it, but the parts went like this: Vegeta crying and moaning on the ground while spreading flowers about himself to prepare his deathbed, while the mysterious Legendary Super Saiyan ran around with a fly swatter and flattening everyone with his beefy arm that was bigger than Goku and laughing or screaming maniacally, never really saying much of significance. Then everyone took timies out to hold hands and give their life blood to the cult leader, but Vegeta forgot to take the previously mentioned anger management drugs that morning, and at this point his withdrawals and feelings of hopelessness ceased, so he was back to being butt hurt over goku being stronger than him, and refused to share his glowing green life jellies with him. Then my CD proceeded to skip through Vegeta&#039;s intervention were he was verbally spanked by everyone, and he made the final decision- did he share his life jam, or did he continue to cradle his knees and stick his tongue out defiantly at Goku? You&#039;ll have to watch to find that out, and then you can decide what you think of how the fight ends after that.<br />
<br />
<br />
All of those elements combined, I have gave this movie and average overall rating of 5 (Mediocre), the individual ratings being:<br />
Art: 8 (very good) <br />
Story: 6 (fair)<br />
Sound: 4 (decent)<br />
Character: 4 (decent)<br />
Enjoyment: 4 (decent) (Although at many times it was more of a 3 (poor) I decided to be nice since Goku did make me laugh.)<br />
And that gives you an average overall rating of 5.2! (r5).<br />
<br />
This is the first DBZ movie I have seen.<br />
I would probably never watch this movie again unless I was trying to show someone else the points of it that were not good.<br />
and I would not recommend it to someone unless I know they are not picky and don&#039;t mind rushed work.

    I have to say, at one point, I thought this anime was going to be half decent. Primarily, it has a story that, though painfully transparent, is quite complex when measured against other Dragon Ball Z movies. They actually spend about half the movie (rather than the usual 5 - 10 minutes) setting up the inevitable brawl that we all know is coming. But having gotten everything set up, this movie is actually let down by the fighting. It&#039;s just so... uninspiringly dull. The way Goku seems to be only half seriously going about his usual job of kicking villains&#039; butts and the way they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26008">
        keep throwing in crappy jokes meant that in the end they completely failed to create a decent battle atmosphere. There&#039;s also a certain consistency missing from the movie. For one thing, Vegita&#039;s change of heart is so badly done I was completely unconvinced. And if they could transfer ki like they did in this movie, why the hell did Piccolo have to do it the harder way in the last Dragon Ball Z movie that I watched (movie #4)?? Speaking of Piccolo, his appearance is becoming kind of boring and predictable too - he makes this surprise entry in the middle of the battle in this movie... except it&#039;s no longer very surprising when I&#039;ve seen him make exactly the same kind of entrance in just about every other Dragon Ball Z movie that I&#039;ve watched. They really need to think up some new &quot;twists&quot;. And the ending... I can&#039;t believe how badly this movie failed at creating a climax at the end. It just sort of... ended, and that was that.<br />
<br />
This movie COULD have made it up to a 5. Hell, it almost made it up to a 6 at one point, but it goes downhill so fast in the last few minutes that I had to do some serious down marking.

    Next December, the highly anticipated “Dragon Ball Super Movie: Broly” (which will finally fulfill the wishes of many Dragon Ball fans of bringing the character to the canon) will hit theaters, so I decided to check once again “Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan”, the first of the 3 old DBZ non-canon movies featuring the villain and also the most popular and favorited one probably along “Fusion Reborn”, only to confirm my bewilderment on how can the former hold this distinction. <br />
<br />
First of all, most of the old DBZ movies tell a story that either just can’t fit in the chronology of the main story (implying

        a continuity break) or unnaturally interferes with it in a questionable way, failing to build much interest in the audience due to the sense of irrelevancy and/or discontinuity, and this one is no exception. Right in the midst of the confrontation against Cell, and knowing how their world is in danger thanks to his presence, Goku happily accepts Kaio’s petition to investigate and deal with a threat coming from the southern galaxy without even knowing how much time this is going to take him, and Vegeta, who only wanted to fight Cell as soon as possible to prove himself, receives an invitation of another saiyan survivor called Paragus not only to become the king of a restored saiyan empire in a new planet, but also to fight against the legendary super saiyan who, according to Paragus, is causing havoc in the aforementioned galaxy, represents a threat to the new empire and Vegeta is the only one who can defeat him. The saiyan prince, who always heard stories about him, doesn’t even ask him why he would represent that since he was supposedly one of theirs, and tempted by the possibility to restore the glory of his race, also accepts to leave the same as Goku, both completely forgetting about Cell’s imminent threat and whose name, despite this, was curiously never ever mentioned throughout the entirety of this movie, as if that threat had never existed in the first place.<br />
<br />
How is the audience supposed to buy this? Was it really that hard to add just a tad of credibility by just dedicating a few lines of the script to this situation? Just a simple “hey guys, let’s make this quick, remember we have to go back to Earth soon to fight Cell!”? I know this lack of credibility and realism is present in many DBZ movies, but that is still no excuse. Anyway, once they arrive on the planet, they meet Broly, the son of Paragus and a very peculiar saiyan survivor characterized by a suspicious calmed and gentle personality (an uncommon trait for the saiyan race), but who in reality was hiding a monster inside that was going to cause a lot of troubles for the Z team. <br />
<br />
It just boggles me how Broly can be one of most beloved and popular villains among the DB fans. He is totally uninteresting, even for DBZ movies standards, or more precisely, was made uninteresting in the way. He could have been an intriguing villain. As someone who was overthrown and sentenced to death by his own people -given the threat he represented to the King for being born with an enormous power he had never asked for-, condemned to wander through the galaxies living in inhospitable conditions and who was later mind-controlled by his own father who wanted to make use of his colossal strength for his selfish purposes, he had a lot of valid reasons to be angry inside, to seek for revenge, and the potential to become more than just your average forgettable DBZ movie villain who wanted to conquer the world or something…was always there. But unfortunately, the movie failed to take advantage of this potential at all by presenting him at first as this enigmatic robotic dude who doesn’t say anything, doesn’t do anything besides making these wacky angry facial expressions whenever he stares at Goku (in such a way that it feels almost as if he was programmed to do so) and by then turning him into a dull over-muscled beast with just 2 brain cells: one that he uses to destroy and kill everything in his path, and the other one to yell: “Kakarott!”. And this was everything the movie did with his character, the famous Legendary Super Saiyan!   <br />
<br />
We never get to know how he really feels or what he thinks about everything he has had to live, what his true motivations are, because he never speaks a single relevant line about himself; when he’s not the beast, his mind and behavior are under control (with a machine that the movie never even bothered to tell us how his father invented or how does it work, not even a single simple and quick explanation: it just does!) and when he becomes the beast, he doesn’t (and maybe, he just can’t) say anything about himself either, he just limits to yell: “Kakarott!”, leaving everything to speculation and allowing for some people to believe that, given the few-friends face he put to Goku and the obsession he develops towards him, the reason of all his anger was as stupid as he couldn’t bear Goku crying all the time next to him when they were babies, when the case could have perfectly been that, for some reason, he was to him just the embodiment of all the suffering he had to go through. Things are, since the information provided was so little and confusing, we could never know, losing all the opportunities to make the audience feel anything for him. At the end of the day he’s a completely shallow character, nothing else but a killing machine that likes destroying everything in his way pretty much like how Kid Buu was, except this time not even half charismatic and “lovable” like he was.<br />
<br />
The other aspects of the movie weren’t better. First, no matter how uninteresting your villain is, you can always arrange some exciting action scenes, which also wasn’t the case here. The confrontation (that takes half the movie) was incredibly tedious and flat, failing to create any tension or genuine excitement, so much that you just wanted the Z team to finish the job quickly to get back to Earth and resume their conflict with the much more interesting Cell. <br />
<br />
Speaking about Cell, Goku’s complete carefree attitude like if he didn’t have to solve this situation as soon as possible because Dr. Gero’s creation was waiting for him, not giving weight to the threat, was not believable. Goku was never that dumb! (At least not in the Z era). Vegeta acting out-of-character, easily surrendering after noticing Broly’s superiority, and as the prideful warrior he always was, also didn’t make sense; that was never part of his personality. Gohan, who was supposedly as powerful as his father (or even more) by this time, didn’t do much besides being passively part of the final solution and helping the alien race from the harsh labor conditions under which they had to work for Paragus, the same as Krilin and Trunks. And Roshi and Oolong, who had absolutely nothing to do here, were also included in the quest just for the sake of adding unnecessary comedy, which was terrible, unfunny and totally forced, doing no favor.<br />
<br />
Finally, the ending of the movie feels like…”well, let’s end this, whatever way, and let’s get out of here quickly”. After a tedious, over-stretched fight, we had a rushed conclusion with the climax literally happening in the last minute before credits start rolling and goodbye. <br />
<br />
Art and animation are pretty good, and in fact, better than the actual main series. But every single DBZ movie also does, so this is nothing particularly special here. Though I have to say I liked the greenish design of Broly’s hair and aura, which highlighted his status as an advanced and superior super saiyan. The music included some of the main series tunes (at least in the Japanese version, don’t know the dubbed one) but somehow I feel it was just ok, it couldn’t emphasize the intrigue and the action enough as opposed to what the main series always did so well.<br />
<br />
To sum up, “Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan”, was just a total letdown. It promised to be one of the best but at the end became one of the most lackluster of all the old DBZ movies. To be fair, most of them are, but as one of the most relevant given its direct connection with the franchise’s most important storyline (the saiyan race), in this case the result should have been better. It missed the opportunity to leverage the legend of the Legendary Super Saiyan (forgive the redundancy) Vegeta was always talking about during the Frieza arc and was painfully boring, as opposed to the other two Broly based movies (“Broly: Second Coming” and “Bio-Broly”) which at least were funnier to watch since they featured the naughty kids Goten and Trunks going in an adventure and were considerably more enjoyable. I’ll honestly never understand what the DB fans found so good and entertaining in this movie and in Broly, who to me was never anything else than an over-muscled, 2 brain-celled beast obsessed with Goku for God knows why reasons, and I’m really hoping the upcoming movie, this time canon, could do something more interesting with the character and his backstory. 4.5/10.

    I recently saw this movie and i have to say im impressed.Broly just looked amazing.When he turned into his Legendary Sayian form i just went nuts.It was spectacularly done.The movie was basically one big fight and plot that surrounds it with the revenge of Broly and so on.The Art was amazing.I was simply blown away by the details.The sound effects were very good and i liked the soundtrack of the movie.It made the fights seem more epic in a way.The Characters are the classic Z fighters who we see in the anime.I really enjoyed the whole movie even the ending which most people find unrealistic.I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review48591">

    From all the descriptions and everything I had heard about this movie, it sounded a lot more interesting than the four DBZ movies Cartoon Network kept replaying every couple of months. The other elements of the movie were poor foundations for the story. Before I had seen this movie, the story sounded fair (6) but with how everything else turned out, it&#039;s only a 1.<br />
<br />
The art is good. It&#039;s obvious you&#039;re watching Toriyama-style. DBZ is a big show so it&#039;s not as if they can afford to concentrate their budget on one movie. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack is fair. The English and Japanese audio tracks fit depending

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7590">
        on your tastes/mood. With the English dub, you get bgm that&#039;s loud and frequent. Sometimes listening to the rock after a while made me feel irritated but it fits fine.<br />
<br />
As for the Japanese track, I prefer Goku&#039;s dub voice since I&#039;ve heard it a lot longer having the dub to watch when growing up. The original BGM is much quieter than the rock used for the English track which let me focus on the animation a lot more. When anyone was yelling, I liked having the English rock going on compared to the less energetic original bgm where sometimes there&#039;d be none playing.<br />
<br />
After about a third into the movie, we learn more details about the legendary Super Saiyan and how the people affected by it feel. It was here I was let down. The characters didn&#039;t seem as impressive anymore. I didn&#039;t enjoy this as a movie anymore but down to the level of a filler. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not unattracted to the sequel or the rest of the movies I have yet to watch. It&#039;d be great if the sequel turns out to be a lot better than this one though it won&#039;t be the next DBZ movie I check out next time. It&#039;ll have to wait until I see another first.

    I truly hate to degrade part of a legendary anime and manga franchise that even non otaku remember as children, but this film was not exactly as I expected.<br />
<br />
Story - the story is what I had major issues with. The back story pacing was seriously stretched, leaving little room for the results of the battle. The battle was shortened drastically and drained the substance of the battle&#039;s adversity.<br />
Other than that, the back story was interesting and gave light on an important figure in the franchise -- Broly.<br />
<br />
Art and sound is something that&#039;s used in the series all around, regardless of films.<br />
<br />
Character - As mentioned, Broly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review174719">
        is highlighted.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - The battle is shortened, but the fight scenes are still ones worth watching.<br />
<br />
So overall, it was a borderline decent film. I would like to see the other two Broly films but this one left me with mixed emotions.<br />
<br />
Finally, I&#039;m not telling you not to watch it, but be careful.<br />
<br />

    Alright well, this anime is about an angry young lad who wants to kill another young lad. He moans about it for the first half and then they fight about it for second half. About half the fighting is yelling and moaning for no reason. ALSO! the dude gets gigantic for no reason.<br />
<br />
Yep that is the plot!<br />
The sound is j..j...just bad because literally its just moaning, THATS ALL!!!! THATS ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

    This is actually my fave dragon ball movie in the entire franchise nearly 100% based on the character of Broly. In the entire series we think Goku is the legendary super Saiyan who Vegeta kept rambling about during the Frieza saga but then we meet Broly who totally demolishes everything and anything in his way.<br />
<br />
The concept of a character so powerful so early in the series was pretty great to me. Before all the super saiyan 3 and Vegeto fusions and stuff this was like the best enemy ever. Broly is just some quiet character till he becomes enraged and then he is this hulking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review67609">
        energy overflowing planet destroyer that the entire cast of DBZ has to fuse power with just to defeat. <br />
<br />
I think the fights in this movie are the best in this franchise and by far the most entertaining part of watching in any movie that came before or after except in maybe Brolys second coming which was another great movie. Tho the first is always the best in my opinion cause the concept was just fresh and new to me when it came out.<br />
<br />
That what we assumed about the main character was horribly wrong and that the super saiyan was not some hero, he was actually the greatest enemy they could imagine(at the time)<br />
<br />
I have to give this only a fair rating since it is not filled with a colorful plot,amazing art or even great music but the action and concept was just great to me. I suggest this movie be your first in the DBZ library.

    The whole Legendary Super Saiyan thing is only something that will cause the DBZ diehard to go crazy about, simply because they more than likely bought into the whole Saiyan deal. Admittedly, I was very interested when coming into this because it&#039;s a really nice concept; the true Super Saiyan of legend who finally appeared to lay waste to everything in his path. I thought it was a very good move to introduce this killing machine as the real deal, in oppose to the good natured Goku whom was supposedly the legend. Despite the premise of this feature movie, in the end, it&#039;s nothing more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202868">
        than the usual Dragonball Z; bad guy shows up, everybody gets beat up, etc. The movie could have been a little more than a mere beat&#039;em up.<br />
<br />
The plot follows Goku and Vegeta as they separately try to discover the whereabouts of this monster. Paragus assists Vegeta but it becomes quite clear he has other intentions. While this is going on, Gohan, Trunks, and company, begin to unravel the mystery of the ruined planet Paragus claims to be rebuilding as the new Planet Vegeta to begin the Saiyan empire anew.<br />
<br />
The production values are on the level of Cooler&#039;s Revenge. There are some nice character designs with Broly being the absolute best. I mean this guy is a muscle bound juggernaut, and he looks like he can kick some serious ass left and right, in which he does. Seriously, this guy probably has muscles in his shit. The animation is a bit more vivid than the TV series, and even though there are traces of the reused cels simulating action going on, there are some good physical moments and entertaining action scenes. The soundtrack also uses several groove metal songs from notable bands, such as Pantera and Haji&#039;s Kitchen.<br />
<br />
The story was actually interesting since Broly didn&#039;t immediately fall into the typical villain role, which is someone who was plain out to rule the universe or something. There was obviously a reason why he snapped. Too bad Broly eventually becomes just another villain and joins the ranks of various villains of the DBZ universe as missed potential, and the character only becomes far worse in later sequels. The plot is pretty slow, plus it has a very weak script. There&#039;s this ultra cheap effort to keep the identity of the Legendary Super Saiyan secret from the viewer, when the title of the movie completely gives it away.<br />
<br />
Things pick up when the action finally kicks in. Plus there&#039;s various attempts to squeeze in the usual comedy in various spots. Unfortunately, the ending was very weak though; I just didn&#039;t like the cheap feel of it at all. <br />
<br />
In the end, Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan is an average DBZ movie at best. It will only be truly valuable to fans of the series. If you&#039;re already sold on DBZ, then this is just another title for you.<br />
<br />
Highs: Production values<br />
<br />
Lows: Weak finish, same ol&#039; same ol&#039;<br />

    &quot;KAKAROTTO!&quot;<br />
<br />
DBZ Movie: Legendary Super Saiyan Broly was the 1st movie on my list of &quot;not looking forward to watching&quot;. I was expecting to hear an idiot screaming that name every 10 seconds, but I was surprised. This movie isn&#039;t bad, and if the plot device was more intelligent and some pointless characters had fewer scenes, then I would rate this movie easily 8/10, but sadly not.<br />
<br />
Anyway, let&#039;s get into the positives and negatives. LSS Broly is a non-canon movie, meaning it is anime original, and Broly doesn&#039;t appear in DBZ manga. However, he appears in Super manga, but he&#039;s &quot;redone&quot; into a more interesting character.<br />
<br />
My

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332691">
        positives from LSSB:<br />
1, Art and sound in DBZ coat, easy positive.<br />
2, The main fight is pretty entertaining most of the time.<br />
3, I am going to give a plus for the TRY to make Vegeta a spotlight for this movie, but it didn&#039;t last :(<br />
4, That small interview with Chi-chi and Goku was pretty nice and refreshing to see them do some &quot;normal&quot; human stuff.<br />
<br />
My negatives from LSSB:<br />
1, Goku&#039;s crying is the plot device. Wth? That is the worst, the most boring excuse for the villain to have a reason to hate Goku. It only made me laugh at this pathetic reason. How does that even work? Are Saiyan children able to memorize events from an age of below 1 year? <br />
2, Drunken master Roshi and some Z warriors on an alien planet. Why? Why was this even the part of the movie? It&#039;s just pointless wasting of time and potential to grow Broly, Paragus or Vegeta&#039;s spotlight. I can somehow understand the picnic at the beginning of the movie, but I just can&#039;t stand they went into the ship to travel on &quot;New Vegeta&quot;. Only to be there and do nothing and add weirdness to the movie.<br />
3, Paragus. What was Paragus trying to do? Kill Vegeta or what? Paragus sent Vegeta with Broly to a different planet alone and had a small villain laugh. I was expecting to see a fight between those two or see Broly returning without Vegeta. Nope, nothing happened. This could add some tension and importance to Paragus. His only role was keeping Broly under control, which didn&#039;t work out anyways, cut him out of the movie and you won&#039;t miss anything. Yes, the sun was a time bomb, but c&#039;mon you have an insanely strong Broly, but you try to kill Vegeta with the freaking sun? ALSO, that wouldn&#039;t work out anyway, because Goku has his Instant Transmission, so the sun added literally 0 tension. The only difference would be some dead slaves bodies, MCs would have lived. <br />
4, Goku saves the day. C&#039;mon, just let someone else be the hero, let it be Vegeta, Piccolo, Gohan. This is just like every single other movie before Broly, with Dead Zone being an exception.<br />
5, Trunks was in this movie only because it&#039;s in the Cell Games saga. His impact on the story was 0%.<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
It&#039;s not a bad movie. It is an interesting movie, that could have been done way better if Goku&#039;s crying wasn&#039;t the plot device and if we could cut Drunken ones from an alien planet and have someone else be the ending hero. Also, it would be a plus if Broly tried to kill Vegeta on their subjugation quest.<br />
<br />
Final Rating: 6/10, I&#039;ve enjoyed this movie. I was pleasantly surprised, and I think I can recommend you to try this movie.

    Story: 3/10. The story had a lot of potential, but failed in the execution.  After whining for the majority of the movie, Vegeta decides to give his power to Goku after a lot of pouting; Gohan and Trunks are basically useless in this movie (despite Gohan being around the same level of power as Goku). And to drive the nail in the coffin, there&#039;s a friendship power-up to save the day against all odds, probably the worst, most unoriginal thing a shounen can do.<br />
<br />
There are some good points about the movie: it has an interesting premise, the atmosphere feels ominous and foreboding, and we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280592">
        get Broly, an iconic figure in DBZ. But the movie overall presents itself in an awkward way, from its bad pacing to our characters having flat personalities.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10. Great art and animation; the Broly fight is brutally intense.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10. I watched this in the dub with the English OST, and I really liked the heavy-metal tracks played during tense moments. Although, at times the soundtrack didn&#039;t complement what was going on in the movie at all<br />
<br />
Character: 3/10. Everyone in this film comes off as one-dimensional and bland compared to their actual Z counterparts. Vegeta in DBZ is a prideful prince who holds himself above all else; when faced with someone of superior strength, like Frieza or Android 18, he&#039;ll keep fighting until the end to prove his dominance. Yet here, Vegeta takes one look at Broly and just falls on his knees and says &quot;We&#039;re all doomed!&quot; I get that Broly is the pinnacle of your race Vegeta, but Frieza literally wiped out your entire race and you still had the courage to fight him until you were down on the ground. Why are you choosing now to be a coward?<br />
<br />
Also, as I mentioned before, most of the Z fighters in this movie like Gohan and Trunks only have a few lines of dialogue and are just meaningless. Goku himself doesn&#039;t really have a personality in the film; even his eager-to-fight character trait is missing here. He just gets beaten up alot and then gets a power-boost in the end.<br />
<br />
Broly might have the least (or most) personality of all, depending on how you look at it. When he&#039;s not the legendary Super Saiyan, he&#039;s just reserved and does nothing at all; as the legendary Super Saiyan, he adopts a more psychotic personality and enjoys hurting others. For a psychopathic, unfeeling villain, he does alright. <br />
<br />
Among all this, there&#039;s no character development or any meaningful sense of conflict at all. The only reason Broly goes crazy on our heroes is because, and I&#039;m serious, Goku cried in the bed next to him when they were both babies. I don&#039;t get why they used this when there was an actual good backstory in parallel with this. Basically, when Broly was born King Vegeta feared he would overthrow him, and so he ordered Broly and Broly&#039;s father Paragus to death. Broly was able to save himself and Paragus from death. This would culminate Paragus&#039;s hatred for Vegeta, and I guess it also made Broly somewhat unstable/psychotic. <br />
<br />
If the movie focused on this, it would be a more reasonable motive. It would make Broly a more humanized character with an actual intention and would develop an interesting conflict between Broly and the Z fighters. All in all, the characterization of our heroes and villains and how they (didn&#039;t) develop was the weakest aspect of the film.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10. The action scenes were great, and the introduction of Broly&#039;s LSSJ form was a high point in this movie, but all in all the awkward pacing and lack of character personality made this somewhat of a chore to get through.<br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10. Alot of what makes DBZ great is absent in this film. The characters we love are watered-down, with most being irrelevant except for Goku, and the conflict in this film is one of the most contrived and superficial I&#039;ve seen.

    You&#039;re a big guy, Broly. For me.<br />
<br />
The first DBZ movie since Dead Zone to be legitimately pretty good; there&#039;s an actual emotional core buried in here somewhere, and the story mixes it up as a kind of mystery plot intesecting with the fights, not dishing out on the brawling until the final thirty-ish minutes. The production design for New Planet Vegeta is really cool, and the twisty narrative is classic Akira Toriyama-style silliness (though it&#039;s clear he himself wasn&#039;t that involved). <br />
<br />
It could have ascended to greatness except for a few factors holding it back-- first off, the main villain plot is a bit weird

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338584">
        and could have used some touching up in the writer&#039;s room before the final draft; there&#039;s also an extended flashback in the middle that spoils everything pretty early on, and it isn&#039;t very well-placed because the characters are nowhere near finding out and there isn&#039;t enough audience tension created from it. Second, this movie is 70 minutes long, the longest DBZ movie yet, and you can really feel that length as the final battle goes on a bit too long. There isn&#039;t QUITE a &quot;Goku gets a genki dama and blows up the bad guy&quot; ending, but it&#039;s still too drawn out for its own good.<br />
<br />
Still, despite that, this is the best movie in the series so far, with a fairly compelling plot and villains memorable beyond five minutes after the movie ends. For people who aren&#039;t big fans of Dragon Ball this might fall flat, but for anyone else, it&#039;ll work well.<br />
<br />
And for my running continuity check, this one is luckily already voided by the apparently canon Super Broly movie that came out this year, so I don&#039;t have to lament that much on how this, like most of its predecessors, doesn&#039;t fit anywhere in the timeline. It&#039;s the same reason as why Super Android 13 probably doesn&#039;t work-- Gohan trying to get into cram school again, and Trunks being there-- but even more egregious this time because Trunks has long hair, implying this takes place in the seven-day gap where Cell has started the Cell Games and the entire world is in a massive panic as the world nears its end. I... really don&#039;t think that is what they were shooting for when they made this movie.
