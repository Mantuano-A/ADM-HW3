    If there’s one anime character this year that I want to punch, one character that I want to throw off a bridge, or one character that I simply want to say ‘you’re pathetic’ to their face, it would be Kazuya Kinoshita.<br />
<br />
Imagine living in your neighborhood and all of a certain, there’s a hot girl living right next door to you. What’s the first thing you’d say to her? For Kazuya, his first conversation with Chizuru Mizuhara doesn’t exactly go his way. He’s far from an alpha male and his social experience is far from his set of skills. In fact, his girlfriend Mami even dumped

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357442">
        him from the very first episode. Not more than 10 minutes into the show, Kazuya is single again and he got so desperate that he decided to rent a girlfriend. Talk about being pathetic.<br />
<br />
You’re probably asking yourself if Kazuya is worth the time watching at all judging from the first few minutes of the very first episode. If you want to save the time, do yourself a favor and drop the anime altogether. If you’re a curious animal, then Kanojo, Okarishimasu will offer the type of guilty pleasure experience of following the life of Kazuya. It doesn’t take a genius to see that he is a thirsty guy. Even his friends falls into this category with their daydream fantasies. Unfortunately, Kazuya is the biggest culprit of being a pervert. It seems the show can’t go on without a single episode of him dreaming up some perverted fantasy, whether it’s between him or other individuals with some pretty girl. Oh and Kazuya represents the insecurity of a manchild. I could say this more than once because throughout the show, he suffers from a deep inferiority complex. When comparing himself to the girls, they seem way out of his league. He is so insecure that he had to resort to blackmail to impress his friends and grandmother. <br />
<br />
Now, watching Mizuhara is a different story. She’s the complete opposite of Kazuya, or at least on the surface. Representing the perfect female role model, she’s beautiful, intelligent, and polite with great manners. But that’s just the tip of iceberg. Deep down, Mizuhara is shown to be a short tempered girl who seems to also be insecure about her own life. I’m not going to lie, seeing Mizuhara’s 180 degree personality change is satisfying. The words she says to Kazuya’s face after her broken façade is exactly what I’d say to him. Their relationship throughout the show is built on lies. It gets to the point where they resort to lying to their families in order to make them happy. In reality, it’s easy to see why since they made their choices. But how long can it go on? Will they take these lies to their graves?<br />
<br />
Storytelling also seems to coincide with fate. Kazuya’s meeting with Mizuhara is just one example but later on, he also encounters Ruka, another rental girlfriend. This brings up complicated manners when she decides to be Kazuya’s girlfriend. She even knows the truth about Mizuhara being a fake and it complicates the story altogether. Kazuya himself realizes the hole he dug himself into and has little choice than to comply with Ruka’s wishes. The irony here is that Kazuya himself gets blackmailed after he blackmailed Mizuhara. Kazuya and Chizuru’s relationship also gets more complicated as it takes on a toll for both characters. At first, it’s somewhat easy to feel sympathetic for either of them. But in truth, there should be no pity. They made their choices on their own. No one really forced them to be in a fake relationship. They chose to make their decisions and the consequences of their actions is their own responsibility. That’s some real life drama that can be applied to any relationship. Only here, it just makes both characters look weak and vulnerable.<br />
<br />
It’s rather comedic the show is tagged with romance. Of course, the catch is that the romance in this anime is fake built on deception since the first episode. Most characters don’t realize this between Kazuya and Chizuru. Ruka’s entry into the story also adds herself as a rival. Mami, Kazuya’s ex-girlfriend, also shows that she is more manipulative than meets the eye. As such, the series injects many scenes of misunderstandings. Some of these are close calls where Kazuya and Chizuru’s secret almost ends being exposed to public. It’s beyond pathetic to watch some of these scenes although such circumstances naturally fits with this anime’s themes. Still, I do want to admire the show’s integrity to keep up with its main premise. Kazuya and Chizuru represents how two very different individuals manage to come together. They are so different that they’re almost like different species. I’m not going to lie, watching this pair’s strange character chemistry sometimes can be mildly entertaining. And if anything else, Kazuya sometimes makes me laugh unintentionally for just being Kazuya.<br />
<br />
Despite the show’s degenerate cast of characters, the artwork style is vibrant with energy. Almost every female character makes the male population turn their heads with their beauty. Mizuhara is the biggest example as she represents the iconic girlfriend, someone who you’d want to show off like a trophy wife. With a slim figure, lavish long hair, and charming smile, Mizuhara serves as the poster girl of the show. Similarly, Mami, Ruka, and Sumi all have their own feminine characteristics that is easily alluring. But if we talk about Kazuya, he just looks like your average guy with his pathetic little smirk and endless fantasies. When applying to the voice acting, I also do applaud Mizuhara’s VA during her personality changes. It’s not always easy to play a character this way but it is convincing. And if we talk about Mami, then she represents the bitch you won’t know what hit you before it’s too late. <br />
<br />
If every relationship was built on a lie like Kazuya and Mizuhara, then we would be living in a world of illusions. I hope that’s not the case for you if you’re in a relationship. Fake relationships almost always have its consequences and this anime shows why. Discarding the real life comparisons, this anime itself is one that’s is deceptive to the core. Romance? Forget that because we’re not getting a real storyteller. Every episode makes me despise the main protagonist and he doesn’t get any better. If anything else, this anime taught me not to be like Kazuya.

    Despite its somewhat Kooky Premise, Kano Kari is an anime that we already seen a number of times before: the story of the budding and slowly progressing harem series between sad sack losers surrounded by ideal female typecast, with all the obligatory comedy and erotic scene that is only very rarely funny that we&#039;ve come to expect of such a story. <br />
<br />
Things are bizarre and uncomfortable from the start. Most of it comes down the plot being mostly coincidence based and so stupid; where everything is just small world with Kazuya and his rental girlfriend Chizuru; from enrolled in the same campus, to living in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357451">
        the same apartment even had each grandma rest in the same hospital. This was actually quite tolerable if this is the only plot points because something has to be made in order to make a story, but no the whole thing then just getting worse with Kazuya and Chizuru keeps lying and they keep digging themselves a deeper and deeper hole. In a sense the story actually could have ended within an episode if one of these couples just be honest, all of this plot event resulting a very frustrating start. <br />
<br />
There are hiccups Kano Kari has within its formula. While the rental family/person thing is does actually exist in japan, the premise is a bit too basic for its own good. The anime is massively dull because of it. The whole Rental Girlfriend thing in this anime was practically accessible to everyone yet none of the characters were even had ever thinking that some loser guy dating ideal girl maybe even use the feature of rental girlfriend. There are some scene where the characters are using google for searching the identity one of the rental girlfriend and It was finded rather quickly isn’t that kinda degrading and gonna put some moral pressure for the rental girlfriend herself ? what if they family had seen it?, it was also practically indecipherable whether or not this intentional but at the beginning of the series Chizuru was trying to hide her identity by wearing glasses ala Clark Kent in the campus, but as the series goes on and more rental girlfriend has introduced none of them are trying to hide their identity. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the characters, they are the series weakest point, Usually, the male lead has some redeemable qualities and we supposed imagined ourself to be at his shoes or at least being able rooted him, however I failed to do this with Kazuya; He’s dumb, shallow, and a proven liar! He’s also getting despaired on an ex-girlfriend that he only dated for a month. He’s a horn ball who like a middle school kid who just discovered erections for the first time, so he goes around popping boners as soon as a girl shows even an inch of her bare skin. Even goes as far as stalking a girl he doesn’t have any relationship with. He&#039;s very very unpleasant anime characters I&#039;ve seen ti date.<br />
<br />
The four major heroine has diverse cast of personality but still as basic as it can get. We got the typical female lead in Chizuru who starts out hating the main character, but she slowly develops feelings for him over the course of the story, there’s the ex-girlfriend Mami whose big pride makes her willing go extreme and dirty making her somewhat the antagonist of the series, there’s also Ruka the ‘imoouto’ type who’s dating Kazuya simply because her heart rates goes up every time she’s with him then you got quiet and shy type of female in Sumi who only appears at the last stage of the series. I should also add that these female character’s seiyuu has quite an extensive resume and indeed I obviously doesn’t have anything against in this sound department. OP was decent but I always skip the ED because I don’t see the appeal of it.<br />
<br />
One of the noticeable things of the show it’s the art; there’s lots of contrasting colour throughout the majority of the series whether it is on the background, lighting and sound text; making it bright and very colourful, but to me the best way to describe Kano Kari visuals is probably something akin to plastic flower in wrapping papers; it was pretty but it didn’t have any sort of meaning. It’s not about the show not looking technically impressive. visuals aren’t everything. But nevertheless, this is a visual medium. In a visual medium, the visuals become a part of the narrative. In Kano Kari however it’s nothing more than eye-candy. <br />
<br />
Characters were designed to be as cute as ever, to be as closest as ideal female girlfriend as posibly imaginable, it’s memorable as it is but simply because the characters appeal rather than their depth and personality which is not a great characters handling. Credit given to the sense of fashion though, as I think Kano Kari is the most fashionable anime to date, the characters wear different clothes in every episode and all of the clothes, from the everyday clothes, to winter clothes and swimsuit was alright.<br />
<br />
Kano Kari has a kooky concept with a basic execution and a tendency to wear its inspirations on its sleeve, it is enjoyable for what it is, but there are a lot of thing that is also enjoyable. This is just harem popcorn entertainment. It doesn’t really take any unexpected turns, but seeing how far these characters are willing to go to screw up their lives to is very frustrating in itself, particularly in the earlier episode. If you have ever had trouble making friends, feel socially awkward in the slightest, or have a terrible love life, this is the kind of anime that is laughing at you.<br />

    Prostitution with an extra step.<br />
<br />
Rent-a-girlfriend. An app that allows you to rent a girlfriend for a large fee. Mediocre humor with a bunch of thots. Nothing is worse than bad humor with cringe. I&#039;m not sure if I can last all 12 episodes. It&#039;s not even good shit. <br />
<br />
Story - 1/10<br />
Slightly unique storyline. Obviously not the first time we&#039;ve seen this. Throwing in more and more girls. Just a big mess. Basically becomes a harem show and it seems like all the girls fall in love with the main character. <br />
<br />
Art - 7/10<br />
The art looks really nice. It&#039;s well-drawn and well animated. Pretty cute. It

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350696">
        has a distinct art style. <br />
<br />
Sound - 7/10<br />
I don&#039;t know about you but I enjoyed the intro. The intro is done by the peggies and I really like them. They have done intros and endings for other animes like Bunny-girl-senpai, Naruto next-gen, and Sarazanmai. The ending song is average. <br />
<br />
Characters - 2/10<br />
The number of bitches and thots are scary. None of the characters seem to have any sort of story to them. They throw in characters to &#039;spice it up&#039;. The main character who all the girls fall in love with has no appealing points. He is just really really awkward.  To sum it up it&#039;s horribly bland. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 2/10<br />
As I said before mediocre humor and cringe isn&#039;t my thing. Bad comedy is never good unless there are quality tits. I hated it and I will watch this anime with my brain turned off. <br />
<br />
Overall - 2/10<br />
Theres 2 types of trashy animes. Trash that&#039;s worth watching and Trash that&#039;s worth burning. This is trash worth burning to the ash so no one will ever see it. What is this bulls**t? Horrible trash. I enjoy listening to the intro than watching the whole anime. I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone. <br />

    Look, I like a lot stuff that most people would consider trash. Some of the many 10s I&#039;ve given out have gone to series that most of MAL, reddit and the rest of the anime community brushed off as bad. I&#039;m easy to please. So when something doesn&#039;t please me, it&#039;s gotta be subterranean level garbage. That&#039;s what KanoKari is. At least in this first season, I&#039;ve not read the manga so I can&#039;t comment on the MC&#039;s eventual development blah blah. What I can comment on is the absolute dumpster fire of a first season that this show got. The only. And I mean

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357471">
        ONLY redeemable quality of this show is the waifus. I love all of the girls except Chizuru and they carry the show for me.<br />
<br />
On its own, the concept of renting a girlfriend due to not being able to get one on your own is actually a pretty cool idea for a manga/anime. The idea of the show is not the issue. It&#039;s the execution. You have Kazuya, a 20 year old degenerate who is not only a loser by real life standards, he&#039;s a real life loser. I mean at least most harem portags are pretty cool and people you could imagine yourself hanging out with. This guy? I wouldn&#039;t go near him with a 10 foot pole. He&#039;s the most deplorable, scummy and downright trash MC I have seen in a long time. In one of the episodes he literally stalks Chizuru while she&#039;s on a date and people downplay it because of a cute moment at the end of the episode.<br />
<br />
Again, I am told he gets better in the manga, but this review is for the first season, yes you heard that right, this garbage somehow got popular enough for a second season, of the anime. I honestly struggled to get through some episodes just because of how cringe scenarios and dialogue was. Despite these negatives, I did enjoy the character designs which I think are some of the best in anime, I did enjoy the girls(except mizuhara) and the series has some type of brightness to its aesthetic that sucks you in. I don&#039;t quite know how to explain it. <br />
<br />
TL;DR This show is trash, but it&#039;s addictive trash and sucks you in. You will like the girls, hate the MC and probably rate it as a mediocre rom com. Still, I&#039;d recommend giving it a go.<br />
<br />
Kanokari gets 5 ribbon headbands out of 10.

    Japan is weird. You can rent dads, mothers, children, even a girlfriend. When Kazuya&#039;s love rejects him, he is just as desperate to try the service. Good for him, the girlfriend he hires is very cute, but he wants to hide his relationship from his acquaintances. Too bad, his new girlfriend goes to his university, their grandmothers are good friends, and they are neighbors. Kazuya also finds out that his new girlfriend is not as sweet as in the real life. How will their romance turn out?<br />
<br />
Rent A Girlfriend has been on my radar for a while, since the storyline alone was enough to make

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357438">
        me interested. Maybe it is because of the fact that there is a grain of uniqueness in the storyline of this anime, maybe I am just a sucker for romantic comedies, maybe both. Either way, it can either be a masterpiece, or I will enjoy seeing it burn. Anyways it does not matter. What matters is that Rent A Girlfriend has an okay storyline and with, pay attention to what I am about to say, minimal effort you can make an eye candy out of this series.<br />
<br />
Story wise, it is quite good. Think for a second, do you know any other series that use the idea of rental girlfriends? By the way, it is a thing in Japan, where you can even rent a mother, who will cook for you and you will discuss your life problems with her. Here, however, the anime uses the idea of renting a girlfriend and there is such a service in Japan, too; you choose a girl to your liking, pay for her service, agree to pay for drinks, meals and transportation and it will cost you from  5, 000 to 8, 000 yen an hour.  Indeed, all you can hope for will be a kiss.<br />
<br />
However, all the problems begin the moment you take a closer look at the characters. The main and only problem of this anime is Kazuya, who is also called Kazu-kun by his ex, but I call him Kuzu-kun, so do not be surprised. Kuzu breaks up with his girlfriend, because of the fact, well, he is not the man Mami, his girlfriend, has been looking for. But, please, wait a little bit, since all the fun is about to begin and I am going to explain you the reason for calling him Kuzu, instead of Kazu.  Having lost his girlfriend, Kuzu-kun starts to fantasize how his ex-girlfriend is having sexual relation with her new boyfriend. However, from all the feelings that any normal human being would have, for example: rage, grievance, indifference, what he feels is sexual arousal; you do know how such people are called, do not you? That is Kuzu, that is the person that does not change at all, a person that does not want to change. He claims that his family is poor, yet he is ready to spend the money of his parents to rent a girlfriend. Of course, I can make this list endless, but I do not see it needed.<br />
<br />
What is funny about it, however, is the fact that Kazuya’s friends make more sense that he does and they have quite interesting personalities, when they are only supporting characters. Hell! Even Mami, who is, let us say, not the best girlfriend to have, makes more sense than Kazuya. Finally, the last character for me to touch upon is the rental girlfriend, Chizuru Mizuhara, who is the only well-written character in the whole series and with every episode you only start to respect her more and more.<br />
<br />
All in all, this is the anime that you should watch. For boys, this is a perfect example of who you should never be in a relationship with, for girls it might also be an example of what boys you should never date. However, if you are pressed for time and are looking for a somewhat good romantic comedy, I would not recommend you to waste even a second of your free time on Rent A Girlfriend. In the end, it is for you to decide.<br />
<br />
P.S. I apologize to all Kazuya that are reading and will read this review. I am sure that you are much better than the Kazuya from this series, hence it has nothing to do with you.

    This is a positive review on Kanojo, Okarishimasu. So if you wanted to watch it but were discouraged from some of the other reviews, this is for you,<br />
<br />
So basically this is the first review I have put out there on MAL. Konojo, Okarishimasu has had my interest for a while, basically since it was announced. For the past episodes I have really enjoyed this anime. The main genre of anime that I watch is Romance Comedies so this is right down my ally. Every episode so far is enjoyable and the endings make me want to see what happens next.<br />
<br />
When you decide to watch this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350705">
        or maybe not, its a pretty different plot from a bunch of other RomComs that I have seen which is what makes me like it so much. The main character is easily taken advantage of and you will see this and can be easily seen with watching just the first few episodes. This annoyed but in the end it will make the anime even better in my opinion<br />
<br />
Story 9<br />
Art 9<br />
Sound 8<br />
Character 9<br />
Enjoyment 10<br />
Overall 9<br />
<br />
This show is very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone who loves RomComs.<br />

    Everyone really be out here hating on this show for its depiction of a hopelessly perverted protagonist and a morally questionable theme whereas I’m just over here enjoying the heck out of this cute yet cringy anime. <br />
<br />
Rent-A-Girlfriend is the latest installation in the ever popular RomCom genre. Anime of this nature are often criticized for generally following similar structures and plot progression, so each individual one often comes with its own “quirky’” gimmick in an attempt to set itself apart from the crowd and draw in some intrigue. The one in this anime happens to revolve around rentable girlfriends. That’s right weebs of culture!

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357443">
        No longer do you have to suffer through complicated emotions in a fruitless attempt to find true love. All you need to do is click a few buttons (and have enough money to pay her of course) and boom! Instant girlfriend for a day. And the bonus? She’s super cute and will have a perfect personality. Since, you know, she’s payed to be like that. This is the situation that protagonist Kazuya finds himself in after getting dumped by his first ever girlfriend and fapping away his sorrows. And it comes to the surprise of no one that Kazuya and his rental girlfriend Chizuru get caught up in an aWkWArD misunderstanding that causes them to fake a real relationship and lie to their friends and family while truly falling in love along the way…yeah, you get the picture. <br />
<br />
So it’s no secret that asides from the gimmick, the narrative is pretty plain. The show goes just about as you’d expect. Kazuya and Chizuru have their share of awkward and funny moments. Other girls, Mami the masquerading home-wrecker and Ruka the eternally ignored short haired girl who’s super dedicated, come into the picture to add a little drama and humor. There’s also this girl named Sumi who makes an appearance in the second to last episode, which I thought was a weird decision to include her so late by the directors. Kazuya also has two friends and a grandma who surprisingly get involved in the narrative, which I liked. <br />
<br />
What’s probably the most unique aspect of Rent-A-Girlfriend is the sheer amount of times that it made me cringe. It got so bad that I actually paused the show several times and had to tell myself that it’s just fiction, there’s no need to feel this way. But you know what’s funny? I actually liked this approach. It was clearly intentional by the author and gave the show a little more flavor. I mean, I cared enough to actively facepalm and feel mild discomfort whenever Kazuya did something stupid (which was probably every episode), so that definitely has to be a positive, right? <br />
<br />
The plot certainly isn’t the focal point of Rent-A-Girlfriend, but it’s solid enough to let the show’s most important aspect take the spotlight…the girlfriends.<br />
<br />
Three of the four main girls in the show start off as rental girlfriends. Chizuru is the first, and she’s the type of girl who can easily change her personality to fit the mood. She’s also a pretty dependable person and provides good support to Kazuya. Some might say that she acts a little TOO nice to him considering the crap he pulls sometimes, but you gotta remember that the guy saved her life and simps for her like crazy with many a cash donation, so her behavior totally makes sense. Mami brings some nice early tension and drama before disappearing from the show entirely until the very end. Ruka ended up being my favorite character because of her great energy and personality. Too bad the short haired girls almost never win. And Sumi…is cute. Yeah, there’s not much else to say about her honestly. <br />
<br />
Now one aspect of the show that might turn off viewers is the apparent glorification of the rental girlfriend industry. Each of the girls has a reason for entering the business, and the anime definitely portrays the profession as being beneficial to character development for both the girls and their clients. Now I’m sure people dislike such an industry, but I personally like to keep fiction and reality separate. I mean there’s tons of anime and other media that deal with far worse topics that have plagued society such as pedophilia and slavery. Yes, I’m vehemently against all of these practices, but to me, it’s just a show trying to be different, so I don’t care if the subject material might be a little controversial. I can understand being against it since it seems to glorify an unethical practice, but as long as it plays its role in the show well and contributes something of value to the narrative, I’m generally fine with whatever content is being displayed. And hey, if you just can’t make the separation, then that’s obviously fine too. <br />
<br />
Aside from the whole buying a shallow substitute for an actual romantic partner ordeal, the most polarizing aspect of this show seems to be the protagonist himself. I’ve seen Kazuya get a lot of hate for being a mostly wimpy guy who sexually fantasizes about the cute girls in his life constantly. And you wanna know the worst part? Get ready…Kazuya faps! *totally shook* Wow, no wonder people hate him!<br />
<br />
Yeah, people probably would deny this, but it just feels like Kazuya is hated for essentially acting like a typical horny dude would. He’s no OP anime hero and, while admittedly overblown in his cringyness (I mean he stalks Chizuru for an entire day at one point), generally acts like a regular guy. But wait, he occasionally has moments of heroism and selflessness befitting an anime protagonist that make girls fall for him, so I guess he’s not completely irredeemable! While far from great, I think he’s a fitting protagonist for this type of show and is an overall positive for the anime. <br />
<br />
I mean, the show itself even knows that he’s trash and constantly pokes fun at him by writing things like “He is the problem.” Kazuya being this way is intentional and the anime utilizes his cringyness well. <br />
<br />
Getting to the technical aspects of the show, the art is the highlight of the anime. Character designs are on point and the girls are equipped with cutely designed outfits. The cast is extremely expressive and the facial aesthetics really contribute to selling the comedy, romance, and awkwardness of numerous scenes. Even though they’re done by different studios, the art really reminds me of Nisekoi in terms of how characters are drawn when they go all blushy blush, and it’s great. Background visuals are pretty basic and I feel like fluidity could be better in that some scenes just look stiff, but overall the show is pretty good animation wise. <br />
<br />
Let’s just take a moment to appreciate the great vocal cast. The studio really went out of their way to hire a collection of well known and established seiyuu to voice the four main girls. They all did a wonderful job and really enhanced their respective characters with their vocal performances. The music is fine, though did anyone else notice that one of the OSTs sounds like a remix of Chopin’s Funeral March at the beginning? Just me? Well, I thought it added an extra layer of irony by basically implying that Kazuya was digging his own grave in a lot of these instances due to the cringy situations he constantly found himself in. I also ended up really liking the episode 7 ending theme not just for the catchy tune but also for the clever visual portrayal of Ruka’s backstory. I thought this was an imaginative way to explain her past without it taking up too much space in the actual show. It was quite captivating and effective in my eyes, and was definitely a highlight of the anime for me. <br />
<br />
What can I say, I thought Rent-A-Girlfriend was a fun anime. I got decently invested in the show and was smiling throughout most of my time watching. The solid production values combined with the entertaining cast really elevated the show for me. It’s nothing particularly great, but it’s definitely a fun RomCom that I would recommend watching…if you can handle boatloads of cringe that is!

    Wonderful, magnificent, splendid, extraordinary! I couldn&#039;t take it, I went to the manga, and it improved my impression, with its exciting and totally addictive story.<br />
<br />
History:<br />
The story has a striking premise, as it is different and denotes potential. In spite of this, it starts in a simple way, with some situational constraints creating a love triangle, involving an ex-girlfriend, a rental girlfriend, and a boy with problems typical of the age and culture to which he belongs. However, this is just a hook for something much more complex, dramatic, and profound, with many other things being inserted into a great plot.<br />
<br />
It is a story that has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review351265">
        a lot of content, which talks about the relationship problems of young people. But it also speaks of dreams, determination, sacrifices, traumas, respect, values, family, and love, among other things. These things are transmitted in a natural, non-expository way, and pass a lot of emotion.<br />
<br />
Image:<br />
The anime is not action to need scenes very fluid, and full of special effects. It is also not very &quot;artistic&quot;, very conceptual, to ask for very bold designs. Now within what he proposes, of being a romance anime with everyday life,  has nothing to complain about. The drawings are constant, ,they are detailed in the characters, they are attractive, there is nothing wrong with them and there is no lack of fluidity in the animation. The palette of colors, shadows and some lights is also agreed with the anime proposal. And there are great hits from the director in the framings. Finally, if there is a defect, is not having done something of extreme spotlight, such as very detailed scenarios.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Sound is the least talked about. The track as a whole was adequate, the sounds are the right ones for the desired effects at the moments illustrated. The music tracks are not bad, but they were not spectacular either, despite the peggies being the same group as Bunny Girl.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
The characters are all well developed, showing the past, the motivation, and all of this being used properly within the anime. They are also not characters with unidirectional characteristics, the good guys are not always good guys, and bad guys are not always bad guys. In more they produce great dialogues, that convey emotion, that match the situations and that have something to go tell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kazuya - He is a young character, who has weaknesses, who is immature, who is innocent, who is inexperienced, and who makes his mistakes. But, his mistakes are not due to malice, and he is a virtuous person in principle, therefore, his successes are so good that they win over anyone.<br />
<br />
Chizuru - An extremely charismatic character, with a strong personality, who imposes herself, but who also knows how to be very seductive, sweet, gentle and kind. At first she seems simple, but this is to hide that she is actually complex, that it has many layers. In addition, she is a character who can pass various types of emotion intensely.<br />
<br />
Mami - The first alleged villain in history, initially has evil actions based on selfishness, envy, contempt, superiority, and other similar adjectives. But, she is a person who is looking to understand herself, to find her identity, and to know what she really wants.<br />
<br />
Ruka - She directs herself in a technical way, and when she decides for what she wants, she struggles with all the forces unimaginable for her goals. It is a character that has great prominence in the work, and reciprocates by creating several great scenes.<br />
<br />
Sayuri - It is the origin of the driving force behind much of the plot. It provides pleasant, emotional, inspiring dialogues, and with lessons. The anime should not get to adapt the most dramatic parts that this lady offers the story.<br />
<br />
Nagomi - A lovely grandmother, who does a lot for her grandson, and whom her grandson does everything to not disappoint.<br />
<br />
Kibe - Kazuya&#039;s childhood friend. He is someone who truly helps and cares for his friend.<br />
<br />
Kazuo - A great father, concerned that his son will follow good values.<br />
<br />
Sumi - A beautiful girl, a friend of Chizuru, who is very shy.<br />
<br />
Shun - Kazuya&#039;s troubled friend, who also has several of his weaknesses.<br />
<br />
Japanese voice actors match the characters, are very experienced, and have a lot of feeling. They have even acted in anime with a similar proposal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pleasure:<br />
The novel excites, the anime captivates, and creates the expectation of knowing how it will proceed until the end. And for those who have already gone ahead and read a good part of this manga like me, the drama of the story is strong, addictive.<br />
<br />
I see that some people speak ill of this anime, but speak with prejudice, pre-formulated concepts about the premise, and especially about the protagonist&#039;s weaknesses. What I can say is that these people give themselves a chance, and watch more open-minded episodes have changed their minds. Otherwise they will be missing out on a great experience, that anime is much more than that, and that without these things there would be no problematization to create an extraordinary plot. With a history that has a lot to pass of content and to thrill.<br />

    Way too many people fail to understand what this story is all about.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s NOT a story about renting....<br />
It&#039;s NOT a story about lying....<br />
It&#039;s NOT a story about a useless protagonists....<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a story about unlikely relationships!<br />
It&#039;s a story about funny mishaps!<br />
It&#039;s a story about discovering your true feelings, doing the right things despite all odds and fighting for those you really care about.<br />
<br />
A MASTERCLASS in character design and development:<br />
<br />
- Kazuya - yes, that same stupid wuss that you think is simping over his evil ex and &quot;lying&quot; to his sick relatives actually shows incredible GROWTH in character to become a strong, reliable, responsible (and maybe not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350723">
        so much wiser) man.<br />
<br />
You are watching A COMEDY! I&#039;m not sure in what world people decided to expect of the main protagonist of A COMEDY to be some womanizer with slick moves and irresistable charm that gets all the girls with a snap of his fingers.<br />
(if you are looking for that I can tell you: you started watching the show with THE WRONG expectations!)<br />
His character looks pathethic - but if you look carefully he&#039;s not (WATCH C A R E F U L L Y)  What he does, when he does it, how he does!<br />
Watch him fight for those he cares about<br />
Watch him do the right things as he desperately tries to resolve the (often silly and funny) issues that keep happening in his life.<br />
Watch him learn to truly love another person<br />
Watch as his sense of justice leads him to protect and stand for his family, friends and loved ones<br />
<br />
W A T C H !<br />
<br />
As the silly comedy protagonist turns into a decisive, selfless, strong-willed lover!<br />
<br />
- The girls - I could write about 5 pages for each of the girls as their characters are even more complex than Kazuya.<br />
But let&#039;s summarize it down to a simple answer of the question:<br />
<br />
&quot;How come each of the girls falls for such protagonist?&quot;<br />
<br />
* Mizuhara / Ichinose Chizuru - She doesn&#039;t! She finds herself stuck with him as a result of A COMEDY = funny accidents and misunderstanding that put the main characters in even more silly and unbelievable situations  creating a big mess of - what? you guess it - C O M E D Y (yes, this is a genre of anime where you are supposed to laugh).<br />
Chizuru is by far the most complex and intricately designed character in the whole manga (yes, this IS an ANIME review, thank you for noticing).<br />
As a main character she is a center figure throughout the whole story and her character goes through the most development. She does have some tsundere traits and moments - but it&#039;s sort of a modern take on the this type of character with a lot more complexity and internal conflicts. <br />
<br />
* Nanami Mami (a.k.a the &quot;evil&quot; ex) - her character has been a topic for major debates in the community for years already. She has more of a &quot;mysteriously dark&quot; aura around her, rather than a meaningless evil character with a solo purpose to break the relationships of the main protagonist.<br />
Mami also doesn&#039;t fall for the main protagonist - at least not initially. Due to her secretive nature her true feelings and motives are often rather difficult to decipher which makes her very unpredictable and highly interesting character<br />
<br />
* Sarashina Ruka - as of the time of writing of this review she hasn&#039;t appeared in the anime yet, so... it&#039;s probably not good to dive too deep into analysing her character. She has a rather interesting background story and fairly standard motives to go for Kazuya. She&#039;s probably the only girl that has actually trully fallen in love with the protagonist.<br />
<br />
* Sakurasawa Sumi - the special snowflake of the show. So special in fact she got her own manga spin-off. As a side character she fulfills several different roles - including: supportive, caring, she and innocent, but also strong and decisive when necessary. She also has her own internal fights and motives.

             A lot of different shows come out with different angles to approach their content. Some of these can range from weird, but interesting, to straight-up stupid and repulsive. Among those story premises, there are usually those that stand out enough to warrant a few eye-catches, only to reveal themselves to be painfully horrendous. <br />
<br />
	This is Rent-A-Girlfriend - a frustrating show that follows Kazuya Kinoshita, a college student who has just been dumped by his previous girlfriend. To fill the void in his heart, he goes out with a rental girlfriend, Chizuru Mizuhara - who does a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357473">
        job where girls go out on dates with people that chose them for a service fee. He meets her at the hospital and when his Grandma asks who Chizuru is, he passes her off as his real girlfriend. This is the main plot - as more people see their fake relationship, the more complicated the web of lies becomes. <br />
	<br />
	Whatever hint at decency it tries to explore is always quickly overshadowed by moments of pure stupidity. The frustrating part about it is that amid its disastrous atmosphere, you get the impression it tried to be moving and emotionally resonant at certain parts, bolding pretending that it does not have problems at all.<br />
<br />
	Overall, the story demands investment without embracing the process to do so. There are a variety of underdeveloped ideas like the growing relationship between Mizuhara and Kazuya, Ruka’s “love” for Kazuya, and controlling your desires. For the first idea mentioned, let’s explore the relationship between them. It is far from touching, and their development is very inorganic. Why? Well, the majority of the time they spend together is sprinkled with the misunderstandings and challenges that come with keeping the real status of their relationship, rental boyfriend and girlfriend, a secret. In essence, the show misses its emotional beat because their dynamic does not carry much weight outside of supporting the main premise of the show. This happens at their university, at the beach, and at the hot springs, all of which have Mizuhara and Kazuya run into each other unexpectedly, for cheap, poorly thought out conflict. Whenever they do interact about something else, Chizuru subtly encourages his behaviour by focusing on what Kazuya hopes to gain, the affection of his ex-girlfriend. It’s unfortunate because the series could have at least had them spend legitimate time together taking a liking to each other, and it could have started from hanging out for real as friends. How about seeing a movie, playing some games, or anything at all? Instead, the show gets so caught up in its supposed “comedy,&quot; which involves escaping these incredibly convenient challenges by the skin of their teeth. It&#039;s so oversaturated with these shenanigans that when Kazuya shows that he is starting to like Mizuhara, it comes off as fake, ungenuine, and forced. <br />
<br />
	Let’s get back to the point about Chizuru’s benevolence. Despite supposed reflections on how pathetic he is, Kazuya is consistently selfish towards Mizuhara. This act of flying by the seat of his pants not only wastes her time but also ends up neglecting how she could feel at that current moment. She rarely shows any long-standing disappointment in Kazuya dragging her around at the last minute and consistently puts up with his creepy, slightly entitled behavior. She is essentially in a constant limbo state while Kazuya pursues his selfish whims. In spite of all of this, the show seems to reward his behavior by having her warm up to him like she actually approves of him. She will praise the little things he does do right and ignore what he does wrong, which is often putting her on the spot insensitively or only thinking about himself. There do not seem to be any real repercussions to Kazuya’s actions, so the show ends up giving this vexing, unrealistic atmosphere because of the message that it sends to the viewer about this behaviour. If you are trying to project that it is a problem, start by having the narrative critique that behaviour through repercussions or even characters conflicts, but the show skips out on it.<br />
<br />
	The aforementioned criticism negatively impacts this show tonally. Why would you fail to develop their relationship in any meaningful way, feature off-putting and annoying actions, and then play somewhat melodramatic music to come off as endearing? It comes off as a joke, more than a serious exploration of the feelings one could have for their lover, which makes more for a cringefest than an endearing watch for the average viewer.<br />
 <br />
	Secondly, it seems to take pleasure in either misusing its elements to conveniently drive the plot further or by throwing Kazuya and Chizuru into contrived, overcomplicated situations. This is done both through its sequence of events and through its character interaction.<br />
<br />
        This is explored in the skewed intelligence or stupidity of the characters. Kazuya’s grandmother falls on the lower end of the intelligence spectrum. When confronted with a situation that contradicts the flow of logic, she almost blindly follows whatever option results in her own personal desires - Kazuya having a girlfriend, as an example. By the end of the second episode, she had essentially gotten Kazuya to confess that he and Chizuru had “broken up.” Yet, when Chizuru opens the door to greet them, she completely throws away the deductive reasoning skills she had previously used to figure Kazuya by buying into the lies once again. Unfortunately, the aura of stupidity that she radiates gets worse each time you see her.  Overall, the problem is NOT that we as an audience are on a different page than the characters. It is that if the average person were put in their situation, it is very difficult to believe they would arrive at even remotely similar conclusions. Rent-A-Girlfriend wishes for you to constantly suspend your disbelief, which does not speak well of the writing quality. In this manner, what little immersion this series has is consistently broken by the question, “Does this make sense?”<br />
<br />
     Mizuhara and Kazuya will also consistently run into each other at the most unfortunate points for both of their schedules. It never uses its natural environment to cause those challenges. Whenever it happens, there is always a convenient, secondary audience they know that is capable of ruining their plans. Again, this happens at their university, the beach, and the hot springs. The show does not go very far with this idea at all. As stated before, the only thing that happens is overactions about the current situation.<br />
<br />
	The characters in this show are, for the most part, shallow. Their characterization is there, it’s just that they either lack detail or are illogical. The character dynamics (I have talked about Kazuya x Mizuhara) are poorly executed and the characters remain stagnant throughout the series despite their many problems.  <br />
<br />
	Kazuya is cowardly, somewhat selfish, and illogical. He shows a very clear and consistent struggle with self-restraint, and his impulsive behavior, often putting him in dumb situations, does not reflect well on him. It is consistently shown that when an opportunity arises that allows him to achieve a certain goal, he prioritizes his desires at the expense of the time, and dignity of others. What was the whole “break-up” scene at the beach with Mizuhara? Did he talk to her, explain the situation, give her at least a hint? No, it was all about him getting with Mami. Whenever he puts Mizuhara through a tough situation, Kazuya wallows in self-pity, pointing in plain sight at what the viewer can see - how pathetic he is. Unfortunately, it’s just that. This is the core problem with his character. What’s the point in repeatedly drawing attention to this when you actively REFUSE to do anything about it? It also seems difficult for him to react to a situation with a correct degree of tact and logic. This is explored in the first episode where he gets mad at Chizuru for DOING HER JOB as a rental girlfriend? Why would one be upset at a fake relationship they walked into? This is also subtly shown when he antagonizes Chizuru’s other friend for supposedly “stealing her,” so instead of thinking of the situation logically, he makes up his mind that this other friend is the enemy. Look, Kazuya HAS shown the ability to reflect at times. He does have a certain degree of empathy, and that part is respectable, but if those reflections on his bad traits are going to mean anything in the long run, then ACT on them. <br />
<br />
	Mizuhara is somewhat diligent when it comes to her job, but she is too benevolent. As mentioned, he consistently wastes her time, yet she will fail to scold Kazuya for his behavior, even praising the little good he does? She willingly puts herself in a limbo state, playing along with almost every idea Kazuya has in mind at the expense of time and her job. He simply is not worth the time, yet she wastes it on him.<br />
<br />
	There is not much to say about Ruka. She is shameless, manipulative, and selfish, often throwing a fit whenever she cannot get her way. She demands that Kazuya fall in love with her, completely ignoring that he is a human being with his agenda and desires. She will inject herself into situations that she has no business being in to manipulate the situation to her ends. <br />
<br />
<br />
LOL, Mami….<br />
<br />
	In conclusion, Rent-A-Girlfriend has nothing but pretends it has everything. From the story to the tone and the characters, everything it presents just falls flat, to the point where when you think it has hit the dirt...it pulls out a monster drill and races towards bedrock. Perhaps, if you view it from that specific angle, maybe it-...NAH, it’s just bad. Maybe you found it entertaining or maybe you were utterly repulsed. That’s not the goal of this review. I think I’ve spelled out that this show would be hard to recommend without at least wincing at what the experience was during the journey.<br />

    Kanokari might be the worst show I’ve ever watched. The story is built on a lie that snowballs out of control, told by a beta knucklehead that just couldn&#039;t stop boasting, and filled with smooth brains that can’t act like adults. I spent half my time watching these 4 episodes cringing at the male protagonist Kinoshita’s actions and their consequences.<br />
<br />
There’s so much to say I don’t even know where to start. Right from the first episode, the idiocy of the protagonist Kinoshita is already on full display. Renting a girlfriend, then proceeding to get angry because of her “acting” is the kind of 10/10 mental

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350677">
        gymnastics that would leave Olympic gymnasts in awe. Her partner in crime, Ms rental herself Ichinose isn’t great either: following him to his urgent and sudden hospital visit is the last thing she should have done, and the rest is history.<br />
<br />
First lying to Kinoshita’s grandmother who we know takes trips to the hospital very frequently, and then to her own grandmother who is coincidentally in the same hospital. I get it, she was put on the spot and had little to no other options but to pretend to be Kinoshita’s girlfriend. But you are lying to people inches away from their deathbed here, wouldn’t you feel at least a bit hesitant to do such a thing? And Ichinose, what about not going with him to the hospital visit in the first place? Alas, the show needed this encounter to essentially “lock in” this idea that Kinoshita and Ichinose are a couple, at least to the characters in the show. This is furthered when they met Kinoshita’s friends and got him boasting about his “real girlfriend”, but I digress. Everything about this show is built on a lie, making the plot feel very forced and hard to swallow.<br />
<br />
The nail in the coffin is that everything considered, these events could all be avoided by simply using common sense. If your customer is leaving because of something urgent, then as a rental, don’t bother him and call it a day. If you during a rental date bumped into someone you know, then just play it off as going out with a friend of yours. These terrible misunderstandings that constitute the entire plot of this show rely on the sheer incompetence of Kinoshita, while Ichinose has no choice but to play along. She really carried this series, being the most sensible person present, but nonetheless, she isn’t perfect, and one cute anime girl is not going to cut it for all this mess.<br />
<br />
What about the other cast members then? Mami might be the most unlikeable character one has ever created, it’s as if Malty is in the real world instead of in an isekai. She’s manipulative and calculating, yet we see time and time again how Kinoshita reminiscing about their past relationship, which adds to the already long list of reasons for us to hate the protagonist. As for Ruka and Sumi, they only appear later in the story, hence because of spoiler reasons I cannot comment on.<br />
<br />
The final thing that I can discuss then, is the exposition in episode four. The author seriously tried his best to get us viewers sympathize with the protagonist, talking about one of his (probably) many silly stories back when he was a child. The problem with that is we never get to see Kinoshita ever do anything that signifies the slightest of intelligence: he literally only thinks with his dick. We hate him for his utter uselessness, indecisiveness and foolishness, not something that could be fixed with some “haha funny” moments, is it? This supposedly heartwarming scene is here only to sway emotions of impressionable audiences, and anyone who with a slightly critical eye would recognise these cheap tricks immediately. For those who want to mention the cliff hanger, rest assured, it won&#039;t amount to anything significant.<br />
<br />
It is then more than puzzling that they actually got a decent OP, ED, an all-star cast of voice actors (except for the male protagonist, how fitting), not to mention good animation. I normally would praise seasonal shows for actually putting some effort in their animation, and this one is definitely above average. The OP and ED sang by the peggies and halca are both great songs that I would regularly listen to. But somehow the premium treatment given to this abominable plot actually makes me mad more than anything else.<br />
<br />
I’ve learnt my lesson that reviewing shows before they end is not a good practice. After all, with 8 episodes yet to air, a show’s quality can vary greatly. But no, I won’t give Kanokari the benefit of the doubt here. Being a source reader who loves self-torturing enough to catch up to the latest chapter, I would not recommend anyone to watch this show; unless you are one of those people who like watching cringe compilations for entertainment, then go for it all you want.

    I’m not a big fan of harems. I personally dislike harems (judging from the trailer and cover) so i didn’t think this show would be anything above average, yet i still gave it a try since i just loved the art<br />
<br />
story: 7 <br />
<br />
to be honest I found that parts of the episodes were cringey especially the first episode, but I liked the fact that i usually don’t see a “rent a girlfriend“ thing, i got to give it props for making me laugh quite a bit!<br />
<br />
art: 8<br />
<br />
I liked the art style it was very refreshing to look at!<br />
<br />
sound: 8 <br />
<br />
the op is so catchy and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350831">
        bubbly! <br />
<br />
character: 8<br />
<br />
kazuya at first seemed really annoying chasing after his ex that harshly dumped him, but i thought about it and came to realization that he is a caring character especially for his grandmother and to chizuru’s feelings.<br />
<br />
enjoyment: 9<br />
<br />
I would say without including the cringey parts I really laughed at the show displaying the embarrassment I had for kazuya and the funny remarks.<br />
<br />
overall: 8<br />
<br />
this show excelled my expectations, I am quite excited for the next episodes! :O<br />

Okay so there are a LOT of hate comments on this anime and let me tell you this: it&#039;s all personal opinion. I relate a LOT to this MC and I KNOW what he&#039;s going through. This anime is NOT for people who hate the MC. After watching the first 4 episodes, if you still hate him, then you should probably stop watching because this anime is NOT for you. I personally LOVED the anime. The story was extremely realistic and the characters were all really good. The main character was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350987">
        extremely relatable and I LOVED him. He has a lot of bad qualities in him as a human being and THAT&#039;s what makes him a human being. He&#039;s the total opposite of Hikigaya Hachiman or Ayanokoji Kiyotaka. He&#039;s a pathetic failiure at love and he is a HUGE simp. And he KNOWS that. He KNOWS that and he HATES himself. He tries his BEST to change himself but since he&#039;s a 20 year old, he&#039;s still expiriencing things so its TOTALLY fine. Im younger than the MC, but I&#039;m a HUGE simp myself, so I KNOW what he&#039;s going through and I hope you give this anime a try. Don&#039;t worry, he gets A LOT better. This anime is all about a trash simp MC becoming a CHAD likable one. Im an anime only viewer, but thats what the manga readers say so yeah... it wouldn&#039;t matter either way, because I already LOVE the MC. I rate the MC 10/10 for being realistic and relatable :)<br />
Either way, this is just my review. This is my first anime review so I hope my grammer is not THAT bad... Have a good day.

    Rent a girlfriend, the title says it all but I&#039;ll actually explain.<br />
Our main character is known as a simp. Or if you are reading this when that word is no longer a thing, Somebody/Sucka who Idolizes Mediocre Pussy.<br />
<br />
He is a desperate virgin obsessed his ex-girlfriend. A girl he only seems to really like because she is attractive. At least he never says much about her personality when talking about her.<br />
After she breaks up with him for very good reasons, he goes online and pays a girl to date him.<br />
A girl would goes to school with him...and lives next to him...and their families know each other...<br />
All

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350868">
        you need to know is that plot will always find a way to bring them together. Also because he is a compulsive liar, he constantly makes the situation worse for both of them. Which apart for it affecting the girl&#039;s time and social life, works for her because he pays a lot.<br />
<br />
Obviously, it is popular to hate him in the community. But the waifu wars are strong. <br />
And to be a lot more spoilery. His ex keeps him on a leash. Why date him when he will probably stick around any way. That and the plot drags them together anyway. And we still have more girls to add to this weird harem thing that isnt really a harem.<br />
<br />
Of course this show is very popular this season and if you are here later you should very much still watch it. Love it or hate it you are gonna wanna finish it. It is just one of those shows.

    Enjoy guys . Actually i wait this because Chizuru !  .<br />
<br />
Story = 1/10<br />
<br />
Art  = 8/10<br />
<br />
Heroine = 7/10<br />
<br />
MC = -11/10<br />
<br />
Many say, that Kazuya reflects people in the real world. Hello B*tch! There isn&#039;t anyone like Kazuya in the real world! I am sure the writer is exaggerating. Moreover, Kazuya is a college student. I might be able to understand if Kazuya is still in grade 3 junior or grade 1 high school. Maybe Kanojo, Okarishimasu forgot to include the &quot;SLICE OF SH*T&quot; genre.<br />
<br />
 Remember that in the MC manga the garbage is not so visible, but after being made Anime then from the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350750">
        episode have seen garbage that is really rubbish. <br />
<br />
Yes, it can be seen in the manga review that Kazuya (MC) barely gets insults like &quot;Garbage MC&quot; .etc<br />
<br />
Score +<br />
Maybe the creator wants to make a story that is always talked about by people even though what s said is rubbish. And the creator managed to make us always talk about this anime. Especially the main character in this story, truly the BEST MC EVER.

    Story:<br />
First of all the story, but they are not really true to reality. But to say it is not too bad. The layout, as well as the psychological development of the character are quite good. That&#039;s the point of the story: it&#039;s about changing to become a worthy person, as well as being a man.<br />
But: But the anime was cut a lot compared to the manga so actually.... Meh<br />
<br />
Art :<br />
As for the art, it&#039;s really good. I have seen many anime but to say the drawing is quite cute, lovely, close. Especially for the emotional description.<br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
The music is really catchy. So really there&#039;s not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350918">
        much to say because I&#039;m not a music expert.<br />
<br />
Character: <br />
The way to build characters is quite new. Partly because I was bored with the current anime trend.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
As said, everyone has a hobby. For me the movie was entertaining to me. If to say, sometimes annoyed with the story because of the main character but that is also a plus point of the anime.<br />
<br />
=&gt;After all, the number of points I can give anime is 8

    Rental GF is the next entry in my Despair Saga and as usual it has taken a toll on me.<br />
If it wasn’t noticeable by the already highly upvoted influx of negative reviews this series isn’t good by any criteria of requirement.<br />
<br />
The romance genre in anime is vast and popular. In recent years however it seems to have become the trend to adapt more “incel” type stories. Yes, I will not beat around the bush here, Rent a GF is an incel anime. This is not to insult anyone who potentially gets enjoyment out of this series by implying they are such, but the main character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review360310">
        is the splitting image of a self-destructive virgin in denial of their own toxic masculinity that you typically find on reddit. If you have any mercy, a good personality or hope left for humanity, you might go into this show with the potential outlook of character development of the main character, for him to eventually realize his toxic flaws and slowly overcome them to feel worth of a woman’s grace<br />
Well, good luck because you will not find it here.<br />
<br />
<br />
The show starts out with immediately fishing for sympathy for the main character, Kazuya. After 21 years of his life as a virgin loser his first girlfriend, Mami, dumped him rather ungracefully and now he is in despair. Therefore Kazuya decides to go on a date with one of these “rental girlfriends” – which is an actual service in japan, more or less – to numb the pain a little bit. He does this without actually reading the terms of agreement and using his common sense, which would make him realize that yes this is a professional service and “fake”, he instead decides to go on inner monologues to stroke his terrible self-esteem to even worse proportions and starts shaming himself and the rental girlfriend for doing this. The series sets a certain tone right from the get go with this. Rental GFs are just fakers. It doesn’t outright disrespect the profession and make one or the other social critique on it – which would make the series perhaps better if it had – but instead tortures you with an utterly pathetic display of a main character. Because of dumb anime-circumstances that connect both Chizuru’s and Kazuya’s grandmothers they accidentally present themselves as a couple to them, and therefore Chizuru has to play the actual fake-girlfriend for Kazuya the whole rest of the show. It’s a very typical fanfiction like premise and I promise you the fanfic writers did it better. <br />
To come back to Kazuya’s behaviour towards Chizuru for a moment, he does get put into his place after he goes on several rants in front of her by complaining how fake it all is and other incel nonsense, but the series doesn’t commit to this in the long run. Chizuru scolds him a few times at the start of the series, making valid points all over the place, calling him out on his unprofessional and disrespectful behaviour towards her, but she sadly also is just a victim of the narrative and the narrative demands her to become dumb and meek and eventually fall for him for no reason whatsoever. <br />
<br />
<br />
Rental gf does nothing exceptional in the romcom category whatsoever. It’s not that funny, the MC is not likeable nor does he grow or redeem himself over the course of the series and the rest of the cast is nothing to write home about either. Kazuya stays a piece of shit and the show lets you know it. He runs around in circles in his inner monologues how he is not deserving of a girl like Chizuru (he isn’t) but it’s so clearly presented as sympathy fishing it actively offended me.<br />
<br />
Rent a gf is one of the few shows where sex is an active motivator and characters are “shown” to participate in sexual activities, only in Kazuya’s fantasies though, but it is present. In other series characters doing or wanting to do the deed is generally something I consider a positive, in this show however it feels more like a torture method. Kazuya gets left by his gf at the start of the series and after a while he starts fantasizing on how she might be fucking other dudes by now because he didn’t get to fuck her yet, this makes him jack-off. Yes, we kind of see this dude jacking off. And even when we don’t, most of the time when we get introspective shots into his apartment, tissues just lie around all over the place. The show’s direction actively point your eyes towards this as well. It keeps focusing shots on used tissues and I’ve never felt so grossed out in my damn life. It’s not subtle at all. It’s not even implications. It’s just what happens.<br />
<br />
And even though the show is not categorized as an ecchi series, some of the shot compositions reminds me of such. Sometimes shots are flat out pointed towards breasts or ass (typically ass) Legs too. It’s almost always distracting. But I understand that it is shot this way to really show off how hot the girls are which is… depending on the taste of the sight of the beholder.<br />
<br />
<br />
Chizuru is by far the only decent character in this show. She declines in character writing later too but she is the most bearable and by far the prettiest character. Which the show will remind you of constantly. The girls in this are specifically glossed up at all times. I have to give it to the production team, while the show lacks in various areas, the character art at least in close ups is pretty gorgeous especially the eyes. There was some effort put in there and the character artstyle in general is pretty cute. The coloring is kind of eye-candy as well but there is a certain problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
The show is ugly. Which sounds contradictory from what I just said but I will explain. It is true that the character designs and art especially the fashion sense (except Kazuya which you might expect) is pretty sleek, well drawn and nice looking but the moment the shots shift away from close ups to more far distance shots it becomes an offense to art. The backgrounds especially have to be among the worst I’ve ever seen in my life. The outlines are so shaky it feels like they commissioned someone with Parkinson&#039;s to draw them. The art itself isn’t good. They aren’t well drawn. They don’t fit well with the characters. When there is a wide shot, the characters pop out like paper cut-outs. If your production is actually good, this wouldn’t happen.<br />
<br />
But not just that, the moment the characters are in a wide shot their heights and proportions are just fucked. I hardly ever notice height differences feeling off putting, but this show managed to make me notice. The character art also becomes the exact opposite of sleek, well drawn and nice looking. It’s clear to me that the production struggled with these rather taxing and demanding character designs even though the last episode was among the best looking ones, which only other one would really just be episode one. It’s not good.<br />
<br />
<br />
The OST is also to put it bluntly: Fucking garbage. Except one track which I like to call “the sexy saxophone” one, the OST is more geared towards a video game like sounding one, which is confusing because nothing in this show warrants this type. The tracks are always distracting and loud, overplay scenes and are unintentionally hilarious. A character will scream at another one and a Tetris type beat will start invading your eardrums. How am I supposed to take this seriously? The answer is I don’t.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rental gf is just full of problematic writing. Mami turns out to be a femcel and talks shit on her private account on twitter behind Kazuya’s back while leading him on here and there for her own self-satisfaction, semi-implying a typical incel “all women are out to betray you” type relationship which kind of gets shafted less than halfway through the show. Which is funny because it is honestly the only interesting subplot this series has to offer. <br />
Chizuru gets roped and black-mailed into a fake relationship-turned professional relationship against her will, gets stalked by the main character for an entire day, even his grandmother tells another rental girlfriend that she has fallen in love with Chizuru. Literally. Not to mention the various times of accidental sexual harassment, like how he flashed a boner because he hid with Chizuru under a blanket in episode 1. <br />
<br />
The other later introduced rental girlfriend, Ruka, who is underage by the way, meets Kazuya by all typical-anime-bullshit running into him and flashing her panties. This however makes her heart rate go up and therefore decides that she is now in love with him. <br />
There is a whole backstory montage rushed in an ED explaining how she has a heart condition and it has to be among the dumbest backstories I have seen in all of time.<br />
<br />
Besides that, even though Ruka shows clear romantic and sexual interest in Kazuya he continues to ignore her because of his now crush on Chizuru. He does this by gaslighting Ruka consistently, even telling his family that she is a pathological liar (pretty hard accusation) and they just believe him. Even though Kazuya is so pathetic and everybody knows it he gets away with so much crap it would make anyone with common sense rage.<br />
<br />
<br />
This all wouldn’t be such an issue if there was actual character development of Kazuya. But there just isn’t. If anything, he gets worse over time since he just gets enabled left to right by basically everyone. Chizuru even humors the thought of him just being a sadboy, misunderstood “nice guy” by the end of this season. Even though you know… disrespected her profession, stalked her, sexually harassed her and all that. It hurts to watch.<br />
<br />
There is so much crap in this, ranging from a bad production to toxic relationships. It is not a good time. All this show has to say is that no matter how big of a piece of shit you are, if your ideologies and personality are somewhere in the “nice” area, you pass. <br />
Spare yourself.<br />

    Kanojo, Okarishimasu is an anime that shows the popular bride rental service in Japan and the implications that are present in it, how to turn situations that can happen in reality. All from a technical, comic and romantic approach.<br />
<br />
Story / Plot: 8/10<br />
<br />
Kazuya Kinoshita is an average university student, who had been in his love relationship with Mami Nanami for a month, until she suddenly decides to leave him, because she found someone supposedly better, the above triggers the main events of the series, since this Love breakup affected Kazuya so much that he decides to try the popular rental bride service, where he ends up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357472">
        meeting Chizuru Mizuhara and being amazed by her apparent perfection, to finally get angry with her and argue since her appearance is false, leaving behind side that is what service is about.<br />
<br />
However, he continues to rent it and it is that after his grandmother suddenly collapsed, Chizuru follows him to the hospital and there the main misunderstanding of the series is created, since Kazuya told his grandmother that Chizuru was his girlfriend and was He is forced to keep lying, since his grandmother fell in love with her when she saw how perfect she was. Soon after, Kazuya discovers that he lives next to Chizuru and that they even attend the same university, because of this they become a little closer and thanks to Kazuya&#039;s compulsive lies the misunderstandings do not stop, thus generating situations of all kinds and the introduction of the rest of the characters.<br />
<br />
Characters / Personalities: 9/10<br />
<br />
In this anime, the boys are mostly very similar, I would define them as average college students and perverts, as with the girls who are not the main ones, only that they, unlike the boys, are not perverts. Oh, and as for Kazuya and Chizuru&#039;s grandmother, we can say that they don&#039;t act their age and are quite lively and cheerful at all times.<br />
<br />
Kazuya Kinoshita, the main protagonist, is a college student at the University of Nerima and lives only from one apartment. He is an indecisive and bored-looking person, with a fragile and weak will, which can be seen in his repeated lies, but which he tells in order to try to protect the secrets of others and make his loved ones happy, although At the end of it all, the weight of the lies is too much for him, but he does not dare to correct most of them. He is really not a bad person, in my personal opinion I would describe him as kind, urged (in more than 1 sense) and somewhat clumsy, but who seeks the happiness of others above his own in certain situations. If we talk about his physique, he is a thin boy with an average height, light brown hair and eyes of the same color, by the way, he is almost always seen wearing the same clothes.<br />
<br />
Chizuru Ichinose better known as Chizuru Mizuhara is the main female lead of the show, she is a college student at Nerima University and currently lives right next to Kazuya. At first glance, Chizuru is perfect in every way, she is cute, friendly and gives off an air of elegance, but this is only with her clients, since with others she is usually a bit different, but in the end, she is still friendly, how we can observe when he helps Kazuya, despite the problems he causes him. Regarding her physique, she has medium-long brown-brown hair with bangs on the right side, her eyes are light brown and she wears glasses as long as she does not play the role of a bride for hire.<br />
<br />
Mami Nanami, the &quot;antagonist&quot; of the series is a college student at the University of Nerima and Kazuya&#039;s ex-girlfriend, who breaks her relationship with him at the beginning of the show, thus unleashing the main events of the series. At first glance, she is a kind and loving girl, but this facade is revealed in a short time and is that she is actually a mean, spiteful, jealous and possessive person, as can be observed in most situations that involve Kazuya. If we talk about her physique, she has an average height, blonde hair with subtle pink highlights at the ends, bright blue eyes and a slim figure.<br />
<br />
Ruka Sarashina is one of the main girls of the program and someone who at first glance may seem rude or manipulative, but after we rebelled her medical condition we can understand more fully her intentions and her way of being, in the same way it is important to mention that she is a direct and passionate person, as well as honest with her feelings… although in some cases she can become insistent and possessive, as we could see in most situations that involved Kazuya. As for her physique, she is a girl with an average height, black hair, blue-green eyes and a blue bow that is characteristic of her.<br />
<br />
Sumi Sakurasawa, is one of the main girls on the show and Chizuru&#039;s newcomer to the industry. Her personality is that of someone extremely shy and introverted, so much so that her main way of communicating is making gestures, but despite this her determination is immense, since she does not allow the communication barrier to hinder her and that is why She went into the business of being a bride for hire, to change herself. As for her physique, she is short, with reddish-pink hair accompanied by a braid on her right side and reddish-pink eyes, but somewhat darker than the color of her hair.<br />
<br />
Something extra that I must mention and that is a plus point in the aspect of the characters, is that all the Seiyū of the program did an excellent job, thus giving very nice and wonderful voices to all the characters.<br />
<br />
Animation / Atmosphere: 9/10<br />
<br />
The studio in charge of bringing this anime to television is TMS Entertainment, which is surely already known to many by projects such as Dr. Stone, ReLIFE or D.Gray-man, this one in the same way, offers us a pretty good animation that only it has a few flaws that are not too noticeable.<br />
<br />
First is the setting, which, although it is not the best in the world, it is not bad either and we must take into account the type of anime that they present us, since the important thing here is the design of the characters and the fluidity / sharpness of these. It is also important to mention that in most scenarios you can see how the objects are outlined in a &quot;blurry&quot; way, that is, instead of using straight lines they make use of somewhat &quot;wavy&quot; lines, but it is still very well done. and gives it a special touch.<br />
<br />
As for the design of the characters, I must say that they did very well, especially with the girls, since they are the ones who are given more importance and commonly present us with scenes focused entirely on them and this is where we can observe and detail their faces , which are excellently made, both his eyebrows and his hair and especially his eyes that I personally have loved and they hypnotize me, they are very beautiful.<br />
<br />
Finally, although the best designs are for the girls, the boys are not bad, they really are normal and this is understandable to a certain extent, since the main thing about anime are its beautiful girls who seek to make the viewer hook on it.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
<br />
In this aspect the anime has a great point in favor and that is that the variety in the sound is great and preserves the quality at all times, for example, in normal scenes we usually listen to soft and somewhat simple music as it consists mainly of a variety defined of sounds, which can even be relaxing, on the other hand there are the comic or critical scenes where mostly a little more &quot;active&quot; music is used, which is usually electronic, but still somewhat soft.<br />
<br />
Now I will go on to talk about the opening theme (Centimeter) and it is excellent, it has a style that makes it easily distinguishable from other opening themes, since it has a fairly cheerful and catchy rhythm, which makes us easily recognize it, As for the lyrics of this one, I must say that it is somewhat normal and speaks mainly of emotional / love things, careful, I am not saying that it is bad. In the same way, I will mention the background video that we can appreciate in the opening theme and that is that according to the above, it is very good, mainly the scenes where the main girls of the program appear, in sequence, making quite a few movements and gestures cute ... what more could you ask for?<br />
<br />
On the other hand, there is the main ending theme (Kokuhaku Bungee Jump) which is at the same level as the opening theme in every aspect, that is, both its lyrics, which again deals with the love aspect, as the video that is presented background is wonderful. If we talk about the song itself, it has a lively rhythm and at a specific moment it speeds up, slows down a bit and then softens completely, and then… enter with everything! Regarding the above, at all times the video is according to the rhythm of the song, they really related it very well and if I go into talking a little more in depth about this, I must say that seeing the main girls in chibi version and with costumes of cheerleaders dancing is quite funny and cute, how at the same time the sequences of images of them with the same outfit are very pretty, it makes them look even better than they already are.<br />
<br />
Finally, there is the secondary ending theme (First Drop), which was only used in one chapter. It shows us the past of Ruka Sarashina and various events that are of utmost importance to understand her personality and the reason for her actions to this day. As for its lyrics, this one is simple, but it conveys a feeling and with great ease, since more than one when listening to the ending theme could feel a roller coaster of emotions that ranged from sadness to hope.<br />
<br />
Enjoy: 10/10<br />
<br />
To tell the truth, this program is quite complete in every respect and can easily satisfy the tastes of a large number of people, since it has good animation, good sound, varied characters with unique qualities, a somewhat different and interesting story and finally many good moments that convey feelings of all kinds, that is, the enjoyment is quite great. Although of course, we must not forget the genres of the program, since, if you do not directly like them, you will hardly have a pleasant time.<br />
<br />
To be honest, just by reading the above almost anyone would give the program a chance and it is that it is not really bad, contrary to how some people say, but then why do they say it? This is due to specific attitudes of Kazuya and Mami&#039;s actions, since they “outraged” many viewers and made these characters earn the hatred of many, but in reality, it is not so bad, since being realistic they are situations and attitudes quite close to what we would see in reality.<br />
<br />
Here ends my review, thank you very much for reading it and I hope it has been helpful, but more importantly that you enjoyed it. Any kind of comment do not hesitate to do it on my profile, I will respond as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Have a happy day.<br />

    Without a doubt, one of the most stressful experiences I&#039;ve ever had when watching an anime. There are very few things that save here, I even liked the changes in tone caused by the change in personalities performed by the character Chizuru Ichinose that comes up unexpectedly and changes the tone of the plot for some time, but that&#039;s practically just that.<br />
<br />
I even understand what he wants to try to accomplish, trying to be this anime that will play with these everyday conventions of anime of the same genre, on paper he can even try to do that, but the formula itself does not escape

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362315">
        much from this model. He is so formulaic that you can easily guess how the director will frame each scene so obvious and without creativity that it is, but at the same time he tries to squander some more creative devices that do not articulate with everything else that the director proposes, it is very hard to know what kind of anime Kanojo, Okarishimasu really wants to be.<br />
<br />
But what really made me give up is how he likes to praise the virgin wanker protagonist. The character is always represented as a victim of the story, the anime wants us all the time to feel sorry for him, and for him to end well with a girl, otherwise he will hurt his little voice. When the anime does not present everything in a formulaic way, it frames the character in a vulnerable position as if he were in the greatest loneliness on earth, it becomes pathetic. In the 10:00 minute of episode 5, when the anime shows us fascinating and dazzling masturbation of the character in a festive and almost romantic way, because he is the poor thing in the story, I couldn&#039;t stand it and gave up.

    Mangaka Reiji Miyajima, our greatest author for simping and simultaneously A MAN OF CULTURE. If you haven&#039;t watched Paolo fromTOKYO&#039;s YT video &quot;Day in the Life of a Japanese Manga Creator&quot; featuring Miyajima-san, I HIGHLY implore you to check out the video. Now, back to the anime review.<br />
<br />
Before I start this review proper, it&#039;s actually quite interesting to research on Reiji Miyajima&#039;s work on Kanojo, Okarishimasu and where he got the inspiration from. Frankly speaking, majority of you living in the West won&#039;t understand the Chinese culture and how society has been harsh on festivities (a.k.a Chinese New Year) of guys bringing back girlfriends to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357440">
        &quot;save face&quot; for themselves, so much so that &quot;renting&quot; girlfriends become a viable option. Miyajima-san ACTUALLY went one step further to be a temporary simp himself to understand Japan&#039;s culture of rental girlfriends (by &quot;renting&quot; them of course and understanding their jobs), so much so that this creates the concept of a hopeful simp (which is our merciless ball-less Kazuya Kinoshita) and the vastly different types of how these &quot;people&quot; are like in the dating profession and such as we all have seen in the anime. It&#039;s a totally alien concept to people living in the West, but for Asian people it&#039;s life as per usual. And it&#039;s downright cool that Miyajima-san created a unique story that has everyone balls-to-the-wall shocked and negated every step of the way.<br />
<br />
SO...WHERE TO BEGIN THIS SHITSHOW? Reddit, MAL, anywhere that this show has been gaining traction for lots of negative criticism. <br />
<br />
The hopeless, useless, dumbfounded, sex-loving simp that is Kazuya Kinoshita. Truth to be told, the criticisms are warranted, but for people who&#039;ve been in Kazuya&#039;s shoes before, all is but one and the same formula. So think of like all the exes that you were dumped a long time ago, and resorting to dating apps like Tinder and the such. YES, he is a low lifeform for thinking that to merely get a girlfriend to have sex, but in the heart of the truth, he is anything BUT THAT. In fairness, Kazuya is a family man, and because of the expectations of his health-flailing Grandma Nagomi Kinoshita to have a girlfriend before her demise, and having been dumped by the worst girl ever (that I&#039;ll get to further in), the college student has no choice but to resort to &quot;renting girlfriends&quot; just to make his grandmother happy. Another point to note is that, he&#039;s a college student, and we&#039;ve all been in his shoes before to unconsciously make too much irreparable mistakes. As a result, he&#039;s learning what it means to be an adult, and even true love itself, because young days are days of growing maturity and discovering more of yourself before the harsh realities of life, and Kazuya does this unwillingly and frantically in the most stupidest of ways, but remember this: Kazuya has a heart that&#039;s just like us, love it or hate it.<br />
<br />
And onto the girls, which are the selling hotcakes of the show:<br />
<br />
&quot;Until now, I&#039;ve always had a five star rating! Give me back my five star rating right now, got it!?&quot;<br />
― Chizuru to Kazuya<br />
<br />
The model girlfriend that is Chizuru &quot;Mizuhara&quot; Ichinose. Pretty, neat and full of unparalleled beauty and glamour, along with cuteness, and fitting an overall image of Madonna. The sharp-tongue, calculative and brash behaviour that is her true colours when she finishes the &quot;rent-a-girlfriend&quot; daily business, and clearly showing off her likes and dislikes. Her relations to Kazuya are two-fold: the rental girlfriend business, and an unlikely source of old women BFFs, meaning that both Kazuya and Chizuru MUST constantly &quot;show face&quot; towards their grandmothers and not divulge the truth out. Following their harrowing journey of near misses with friends and business colleagues aside, these two IMO are the perfect pairing of one another in terms of family relationships (that although is not shown in the anime, the manga really goes in deep). If you need someone to count on to protect and stand up for, this perfect woman is it.<br />
<br />
“New girlfriend a month after breaking up? Is he trying to get back at me or something? What was her name again? Chizuko? Tsuruko? Can&#039;t remember. Can&#039;t believe he sided with her against me. I&#039;ll make sure they break up.&quot;<br />
― Mami to herself<br />
<br />
The bitchy ex-girlfriend of Kazuya&#039;s, antagonist Mami Nanami. A stereotypical mind-game player of feelings and emotions run wild, she is constantly seen as the one that most people will NOT want to be with, a control freak to put it simply and wreck Kazuya&#039;s life every step of the way. She holds the facade of being a kind, caring and supportive girl, but her reality is way more scarier in that her petty and manipulative character will often desire ominous dark clouds of darkness, aimed squarely to swear and mock her mortal enemy (that is Kazuya) to a possessive-aggressive point of satisfying her own ego. You&#039;d better watch out if Mami is stalking anywhere near you!<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#039;t stand it anymore. Even if you think I&#039;m weird... Or cringeworthy... just being like this makes me happy enough to shed tears...&quot;<br />
― Ruka to Kazuya<br />
<br />
The serious girlfriend player, Ruka Sarashina. The girl that has a heart that beats slower than the average person and seeking a lover that will help her cope with her condition. Often referred to as a character who&#039;s being straightforward and passionate person who is honest with her feelings, it can come off as pushy and possessive, resulting in her fixated focus on the idea that getting a boyfriend would help her in having a faster heartbeat. To make matters even worse, she is stubborn to realize her faults and will often push to shove then things get difficult. She is a real handful to handle, and Kazuya&#039;s constant runaway has proven more than not. Serious, but very clingy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kazuya! See you again!&quot;<br />
― Sumi to Kazuya<br />
<br />
The newcomer into the &quot;rental girlfriend&quot; business, 1st year college student and simultaneously working in Chizuru&#039;s agency, Sumi Sakurasawa. The extremely shy, introverted, sign-language-ful person of communication, she&#039;s a real hot cutie, AND SHE MUST BE PROTECTED AT ALL COSTS.  She&#039;s the only rental girlfriend that has LESS screentime than the others, but she has a heart of determination to follow up on things that she can improve in a.k.a Kazuya&#039;s mock-up date with her for Chizuru&#039;s hand of help. As such, she is one of the series&#039; most coveted characters, and her introverted side will have many guys squeal at her cutesy blushing (mine included).<br />
<br />
Of all the girls that If I had a choice to &quot;rent&quot;:<br />
- Chizuru is at the top of the food chain, so maybe on an occasional basis.<br />
- Mami? HELL NO, she is SICK BOTH PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY.<br />
- Ruka is somewhat of a chore to handle, and I personally don&#039;t like clingy girls, so she is 50/50.<br />
- Last but not least, Sumi, which is A DEFINITE YES, because I can relate to her character the most, and who doesn&#039;t like a shy, young girl to hang out with?<br />
<br />
The difference with Miyajima-san&#039;s manga is that Kanojo, Okarishimasu is done digitally, as opposed to the hard-working paper and pencil figure, so putting this into consideration and translating into animation isn&#039;t such a chore. And TMS Entertainment did a good job in the translation of the manga into some good ol&#039; animation and vibrant art that I can afford to watch for days on end. The manga art was quite yielding to the standards of when Miyajima-san started (and entered into serialization), but to see all of it animated was such a blessing that I&#039;d not think to see the light of day.<br />
<br />
On the music side, the peggies are back, and &quot;Centimeter&quot; is such a good ol&#039; boping OP that&#039;s a straight banger through and through. Halca&#039;s ED of both the general and Ruka&#039;s backstory are also great songs. For a series that everyone have divisive views on simping, at least the OST was a nice accompaniment to add onto the messy phase of switching girlfriend after girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Look y&#039;all, many of you may hate this show to oblivion of the source materials and such, but I&#039;d feel like I need to offer my no-frills review of a love-hate relationship between the MC Kazuya and the various waifu girlfriends (well, mostly for Chizuru and Sumi only) from an anime-only perspective but with the knowledge of the manga and how it became to be. My reason for creating this review is to break the stance of haters, and a huge thanks for reading through a long-ass review that I truly mean my whole heart with.<br />
<br />
HERE I COME, SEASON 2! I&#039;d really wish this series would continue and make my heart flutter like butterflies.
