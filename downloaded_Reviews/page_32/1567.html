    There isn&#039;t really a satisfactory review for this awesome show, so I thought I&#039;d write one.<br />
<br />
Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere is an adaptation of a light novel of the same name. The premise is that Musashi (the main ship or the protagonists of our story), is trying to recover the emotions of P-01s, aka Horizon Ariadust, as they were taken from her to create WMDs. However, Musashi is not considered a world player in this setting, because they&#039;re simply exiles from Japan, who are being watched by the Testament Union, who &quot;guides&quot; the world by making sure that history is reenacted.<br />
<br />
This premise sounds pretty

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73915">
        confusing, and admittedly it is, due to the insane depth of universe. There are a LOT of terms and truthfully, a language system (it&#039;s Japanese, with a few quirks), that you have to get used to. The result of this though, is a sci-fi / fantasy epic that I don&#039;t think even Kinoko Nasu could hold a candle to.<br />
<br />
The show (in my opinion) is heavily dialogue driven (remember, this is a show about historical reenactment, but reenactment comes through interpretation). There will be some pretty intense dialogue scenes as a result, since the premise of the show pretty much requires some sort of politics. <br />
However, the action (e.g., fights) are not skimped on at all (ever seen a city-ship do a backflip?) The characters are all interesting, with their own quirks, and even seemingly minor characters are explored and play a role in the story. The animation is excellent, with an amazing soundtrack to boot (it&#039;s great in season 1, and just awesome in season 2).<br />
<br />
Admittedly Horizon isn&#039;t a show for everyone, but if you&#039;re willing to get through a little exposition (about 5-6 episodes of season 1), you&#039;re in a for a real treat, (what I believe to be the best action show in years).<br />
<br />
Looking forward to season 3 and beyond!

Yay, my first review! <br />
<br />
Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon II, an interesting anime to say the least. After watching the first season, I came into Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon II with average expectations, and in the end was rather pleased with the second season. <br />
<br />
Story:7<br />
As with the first season, the story of Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon II can be very confusing at times. It has a futuristic setting, yet at the same time mixing in historic and fantasy elements, and the shows on story can be pretty convoluted in itself at times, leaving people a bit conflicted on it at times. Not to say its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73911">
        bad though, far from it. Once you understand (or for some people, look past) most of the plot and back-round, you have a unique and different story the likes of which I (personally at least) have not seen before.<br />
<br />
Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon II also does very good in the romance department, not just for the main protagonist but for quite a few of the supporting cast as well, which is something I really enjoyed. Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon II also, like its predecessor, brings some interesting elements I haven&#039;t seen much in other anime to the table, such as the political negotiations. Some people wont enjoy those moment, but others like myself will find it quite interesting. <br />
<br />
The humor in Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon II is also a high point, and it usually pulls it off rather well. Some people wont like it as a lot of is humor tends to be ecchi based, but usually it isnt too heavy and knows its place (although there are some exceptions) The humor can also be quite random (especially concerning the main protagonist) which a lot of people don&#039;t like, but others will enjoy.<br />
<br />
In the end I&#039;d say the whole Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon series kind of a hit or miss, and it hit for me.<br />
<br />
Art:8<br />
Now I&#039;m no artist, so I wont have too much to say here. The art was very well done, with fluid action scene&#039;s that didn&#039;t seem to cut to many corners. Character design is varied, and the use of what I believe to be CG during the air ship battle&#039;s is well done. (not sure if it really is CG, so don&#039;t quote me on that) In the end I was very satisfied by the artwork and found it better than a lot of the other stuff out there.<br />
<br />
Sound:9<br />
A high point for the series. Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon II has some great tracks and really knows how to set the mood. The soundtrack really riles you up and draws you into the action, and can also wind down for soft, emotional scene&#039;s. I enjoyed the OP and ED, but it&#039;s nothing spectacular. There is one thing I have to give special attention to though, that being Horizons singing. It is BEAUTIFUL, and I loved listening to it every time. They know when to have her sing, and when she does its amazing.<br />
<br />
Characters:9<br />
This is another high point of the series. The Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon series features a wide array of varied cast members, and the second season does not fail in that aspect. The show gives time to develop or focus on different characters, and sometimes even introduce and add more cast members. For a large part of the second season Tori and Horizon actually stepped out from the spotlight to make room for other members of the cast. For instance although more of a backround character in the first season, Tenzou plays a much bigger role in the second season which I really enjoyed. Other times characters come into the limelight for a few episode&#039;s before swapping places with others, and some are just there for the random hilarity. (such as nenji the slime or that random curry guy)<br />
<br />
As stated before, romance plays a pretty big part in this series, and is even one of its main driving forces as with Horizon and Tori. The whole Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon series knows how to do romance well, and I was never really disappointed with it. It even shows you the romantic situations with supporting caste members such as Gin and Muneshige, Tenzou and Mary, and the two witches (although sometimes they kind of weird me out, not gona lie) And lets not forget those two students and the ghost kid, their just too cute! xD<br />
<br />
One thing needs to be mentioned though, that being the main protagonist Tori. Many people find him obnoxious, and I myself have to agree at times. He literally never stops smiling, which isn&#039;t really a bad thing per se, but he could have been a better protagonist if he took things more seriously sometimes. I mean, he can be serious, but not frequently enough. I&#039;m not going to start hating him as a character, I mean the show wouldn&#039;t be what it is without him, but he could have been done better. On the other hand, maybe this is all building up to some epic climax where he DOES get serious, that would actually be pretty awesome.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:9<br />
In the end I enjoy Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon series for what it is, a convoluted plot with a wide variety of cast members with well done romance and whacky humor. The style of the fighting really hit my sweet spot and the the end I find myself really enjoying this series and cant wait for future seasons.<br />
<br />
Overall:8<br />
Overall I think I&#039;ll give Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon II an 8. It hit a sweet spot for me with the action, frequent and well done romance, and a well done sountrack. In the end I find myself comparing this series to Gurren Lagann. It can be whacky at times, but it has a lovable cast with action and a soundtrack that really grabs you and takes you on a ride if you can get into it. Others, unfortunately, will be left behind, unable to either understand or look past the convoluted story line, randomness, and its lack of seriousness at time&#039;s. I myself, cant wait for more seasons, and at this speed this series is going I expect 2 or 3 more.<br />
<br />
TL;DR version:<br />
All in all this whole series is rather hit or miss. Those who dont wont be able to look past its randomness and whackyness, or maybe wont be able to look past or understand its convoluted plot. If you CAN, however, I believe you will thoroughly enjoy yourself with this anime, finding an unique plot, a wide variety of lovable characters, a good soundtrack that really gets you engaged, awesome battle scenes, and very well done romance. <br />
<br />
I hope this review helped whoever is curious about this anime.

    After finishing watching this sequel series of the original Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere, I took a deep breath. A breath of refreshment. A breath of coolness. A breath of that feeling of “what the fuck did I just watch”. But what I got from this series is what I expected. Yes, that&#039;s right. Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere II is one of those series that I found so bad that it&#039;s that damn good.<br />
<br />
Like season 1, this sequel takes place in a fantasy world, a world of politics, war, and excitement. The cast is still there with Tori who plays the usual

          <span style="display: none;" id="review75823">
        fool. He&#039;s the guy who is naked nearly the entire series but finds himself at ease especially with his friends and the person he cares about the most, Horizon. But let&#039;s not forget the other characters in the series. Take for example, Tenzou Crossunite, the guy with the strange hat of a personality. Tenzou has a perverted personality but a heart of gold as he puts his life at risk for the well being of others. He gets a ton of screen time in this sequel and for a big breasted woman that he falls in love with. It&#039;s the greatest romance story ever told. Well, that&#039;s an exaggeration but it does have its flavors.<br />
<br />
At any rate, Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere II (also known as Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon II) is the direct sequel of the original series. If you never seen the prequel, then you might get a lot of WTF moments and I mean that literally.<br />
<br />
Right from the beginning, there is a battle between the main ship&#039;s crew and a bunch of baseball player wannabees. The main cast returns to battle against many of these enemies particularly four elites who executes their powers in their own rights. Many characters participates in the thrilling action that results in a dramatic yet entertaining fight. It doesn&#039;t really make much sense at times especially with some of the most egoistic speeches coming from some of the cast characters. Yet, I find it entertaining because Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere does what it does best: delivering entertainment.<br />
<br />
Despite all the humor going around (more than just Tori&#039;s nakedness), there is some emotions as well. Tenzou struggles throughout the latter half of the series not only physically but mentally as he attempts to save a woman that he loves. The romance is very peculiar as it&#039;s not the usual shoujo type or the “love at first sight” but rather based on mutual respect, affection, and a sprout that bloomed into love.<br />
<br />
The other characters that are part of the cast seems to be everywhere. Some of them doing the battles, others finding time to regroup, while a certain individual questions about the meaning of “sex”. Speaking of which, the female characters retain their appealing designs with those melon-sized boobs and mechanical structures. The unusual designs of the maid costumes, military uniforms, and some of the nakedness are presented throughout the series. In fact, Tori is naked nearly every episode except some final moments when he realizes that the show is about to end.<br />
<br />
The artwork of the series still retains its generic design. It looks like more of the modern computer generated graphics than hand drawn but otherwise looks just so-so. There isn&#039;t much to say on the art itself since everything remains the same from the prequel. The science fiction aura that it gives off is there with its architectures, space vehicles, and mecha warfare. The backgrounds still has its natural feeling of the futuristic style courtesy of Horizon.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, music is what made this series epic. By epic, I mean it&#039;s like sound vibrations having sex with your ears. Well, that&#039;s a bit exaggerating but it gets the point through. The soundtrack of the prequel and this sequel, Horizon II, presents a catchy score that mixes in techno, emotional, and those action ost you can only listen to in this series. The OP song, &quot;ZONE//ALONE&quot; is executed well that shows many of the montages of the cast of characters and their excitement of lusting for battles. Minori Chihara (Horizon of the Middle of Nowhere I, Busou Shinki, Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu) performs the opening song once again that presents some thrilling sound vibes.<br />
<br />
All in all, Horizon II is one of the strangest series I&#039;ve ever seen such like the original. It gave me more of those “wtf” moments than nearly every show that I&#039;ve watched so far this year. And by “what the fuck”, there is no question mark to it because the reaction is exciting. The flaw I do see in Horizon and this sequel is that perhaps the story is a bit too blend, nonexistent, and just thrown into pieces scattered across...everywhere. The story is naked (blend) like Tori and still “in the middle of nowhere” that has a weak exposition. If you can ignore that part though, this sequel is an exciting watch especially those looking for an action packed adventure.

    &quot;Why is her butt so round?&quot; Man has pondered this question since the dawn of the First Age. As we look upon the history of earth - whether it be during the construction of the pyramids, the French Revolution, or the day skin tight spandex was invented; the answer to this question has been sought. Thousands of years into the future, when humanity has fallen from the heavens, this very question will be answered. &quot;Who cares? Lets make her my girlfriend.&quot; Backed with his army of loyal friends, Tenzo Crossunite embarks on a journey to obtain a Big Busty Blonde of his very own.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
The beloved

          <span style="display: none;" id="review83923">
        ninja takes center stage this season as he attempts to woo a certain well-endowed English woman while Musashi simultaneously defends England from an invasion by the Spanish Armada. The overarching plot is still present as Horizon and Toori continue to pursue the automotons scattered emotions, but though it is present, Tenzo&#039;s antics greatly overshadow it. The setting is infinite, the romance is touching, the story is interesting ( if not cliche), what more could you ask for? Oh wait, that&#039;s right...<br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
The first season of Horizon bore a seed. Not just any seed. It was the Money Tree Seed, which blessed Sunrise with unlimited cash. Where did this cash go? It went into crafting this wonderfully animated sequel. From fanservice to fightservice, everything in season two is well animated, choreographed, and directed, leaving nothing to be desired. Unless you dislike the art style and design in general. And to those who dislike those skin-tight tight body suits and balloon chests I say - I respect your opinions but they are wrong. If you&#039;re going to hate though, I&#039;m sure you can hate on the...<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
Wait what? The music of Horizon is exceedingly fitting and filled with a kaleidoscope of variety? Well shit. I can&#039;t really complain about the up-beat and carefree flutes accompanying the daily lives of Musashi&#039;s student council, nor can I jeer at the soft-tempo&#039;d yet emotionally rending melodies setting the mood for romance. Hell, I could say I actually liked the determination felt as Ketsui wo Himete paced alongside the rising action, and the euphoria I felt as the song resonated in tune with the climax of the episode. The ONLY tracks I could say that underwhelmed me were the English themed ones. Yet with this minor gripe in mind I can personally guarantee the OST will save you from anything.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
When you have a pervert whose sadness will be the death of him, a ninja who&#039;s emotions are depicted by his hat, a mechanically armored half dragon eroge enthusiast, an all knowing erotic dancer, and a flat chested werewolf it&#039;s hard to keep the other 300 members of the cast interesting. Wait, shit. They&#039;re ALL that interesting. Whether it&#039;s our lovable protagonists, or the equally lovable antagonists, care is taken to show both sides of the story. You could hardly call the antagonists villains if they didn&#039;t oppose the main cast for the sake of history recreation. Honestly in the Horizonverse the main cast are kind of the bad guys. What with the whole &quot;Conquering the world&quot; thing Toori&#039;s got going on.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment <br />
<br />
Something of this level isn&#039;t churned out mechanically. Great care and detail is put into crafting every scene perfectly. Laugh worthy comedy, magnificently choreographed conflicts, beautifully integrated music, and compelling characters are thrown into a vast and detailed world to pursue their own goals. And you know what? I enjoyed every fucking second of it. Why exactly is it again that her butt is so round? I forgot because everything else in the series was too mind-blowing.

    This is my review for both seasons- Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon II is probably one of the most unbalanced, whacky, unorthodox, and weirdest anime this year. Here are the reasons why: <br />
<br />
The story doesn&#039;t make any coherent sense whatsoever. I really hoped that Season 2 would improve from Season 1 but it did not. If anything, it might have gotten even worse. I enjoyed the very first episode of Horizon and I thought this was going to be the next big hit this year, but after Episode 1 it just started dropping in quality. I swear, the people that write the scripts are on crack. <br />
<br />
[Minor

          <span style="display: none;" id="review70941">
        Spoiler:]Seriously, how can you ask someone if you can be King and they just give that title to you for no good reason? The story is hard to follow, and it&#039;ll just put strain on you if you even try to comprehend what the hell is happening.<br />
<br />
[Minor Spoiler:]Seriously, how does going on a date have anything to do with a war? In Season 2, everyone is fighting in a life or death battle just so one perverted and idiot King, can go on a date with a lifeless drone with no emotions. <br />
<br />
The action sucks too. It&#039;s just so ridiculous that I cannot describe in words how much the action barely makes any sense in several battles. Its just... indescribable.   <br />
There is almost little to no thrill at all when watching this show. You will never be at the edge of your seat in any battle. Ever. Maybe you&#039;ll go like &quot;Ah, he got hit. Whatever. Do I really care?&quot;<br />
<br />
The characters are unique though, but some of them just make you go &#039;what the heck is this?&#039; Seriously, some characters look like they belong from Alice in Wonderland. Some characters look way too out of place and they look like they got lost or they should just return to whatever freaking planet they came from.<br />
<br />
A problem with some of the characters are that too many of them look alike, have gargantuan hair, and so many of them have big breasts that its just downright horrendous. If you&#039;re going to have a character who is pretty good eye candy, then the show should just have one or two of those characters but they slam-dunked a ridiculous amount of overly big-breasted girls. <br />
Another problem is the Main character. He is unlikable in every way. He&#039;s retarded, useless, and annoying. In fact, his voice gets so annoying that you feel like strangling the voice actor. <br />
And I have never taken a liking to the main heroine, Horizon. And in a show where there&#039;s tons of other big breasted girls, that&#039;s pretty bad. The main heroine is boring to watch and boring to listen to. <br />
<br />
All the characters belong in the Musashi Ariadust Academy school. And right off the bat, they all have a lot of special talents or fighting capabilities and skills. My question is, if you already have what you wanted to acquire, why bother going to school? To me, it felt like the whole entire school program was a waste of time. I felt as if the characters learned nothing from the school. And after 3 or 4 weeks, they graduate from the school and go straight into war. How stupid does that sound...? Again, poor story mixed with poor characters= poor everything. <br />
<br />
The only thing that is good about the series is the art and sound. The sound is crystal clear and the art is probably the best this year. So thus, the show comes up from a 3 rating to a 4. Congrats, Horizon. <br />
<br />
And here is the last thing that many of you may dread to hear: <br />
The ecchi does not make the show any better. I&#039;m serious. I have finished many animes that were pathetic just because of the ecchi in it. But this show is so horrendous that even the many ecchi scenes does not save the show. Does that sound weird to you? Big-breasted girls and ecchi should equal a pretty good time right? No. This show still sucks. The girls and ecchi doesn&#039;t compensate for the rest of the crap this show has in it. <br />
The only good part of the ecchi is that they are ice-breakers for many confusing situations. It&#039;ll make everyone go,<br />
&quot;Ah! I understand that! A guy touching a girls boobs should be easy for me to understand!&quot; <br />
Then when that ecchi scene ends, it goes right back into confusing BS supported with a poor story. <br />
<br />
Still not convinced that this anime sucks? Well-<br />
They spend one whole episode doing speech and debate. Yes. I&#039;m serious. <br />
<br />
I enjoy washing dishes as much as I enjoy watching this show. And I don&#039;t enjoy washing dishes. Trust me. And therefore, I don&#039;t enjoy this abomination of an anime. My overall rating of the show is a 4. The show was saved by excellent art but was mostly destroyed due to bad character structure and poor story plotting. <br />
<br />
The only reason why I&#039;m still watching the anime is because I always finish what I start. But, heed my warning- this anime defines &quot;ugly&quot;. <br />
<br />

    [This is my first review, please go easy on me]<br />
<br />
This is a review of the two seasons of Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon, which I will abbreviate with &quot;Horizon&quot; from now on. I decided to treat both seasons as one, as the producers immediately anounced a sequel after the first season was over and it leaves  with a cliffhanger. So let´s dive right into the story of &quot;Horizon&quot;<br />
<br />
Story - 3<br />
<br />
From what I understand, this anime is based on a light novel series where each novel consists of more than 1000 pages and there´s eleven of them up to this point. So it comes as no

        surprise, this story could only end up in a mess. I don´t really know which parts of the light novel got incorporated into the anime and I don´t know if the story makes more sense in the light novels. All I can say is that the story in the anime itself is a convoluded mess. Most of the time you will be struggling to remember all kinds of different terminologies and names. I had to stop several times just to catch my breath and trying to understand what´s going on. The whole story about reenacting the world´s history, the students on the ship Musashi trying to regain the emotions of Horizon (the character Horizon) and preventing some sort of apocalypse does sound interesting, but none of them are really explained very well and will leave you with a big questionmark on top of your head. <br />
Everything just seems kind of random and pops out of nowhere, haha. Get it? The title of the anime translates to &quot;Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere&quot; and that just sums it all up. You literally feel like this story is getting nowhere as there are far too many different plot lines that are loosely connected to each other and often don´t really make any sense. I can at least say that the story of the anime pretty much sucks, but I will hold my horses for the light novel series. Maybe it made sense there, but it´s definitely not true for the animated version.<br />
<br />
Art - 7<br />
<br />
I think this is the only real redeeming quality this anime has. I thought the animation was pretty decent in the action scenes and the scenery looks pretty good. So the visuals definitely make watching the anime a bit easier.<br />
<br />
Sound - 5<br />
<br />
Not much to say here. I found the OP songs were pretty forgettable and most of the BGM tracks didn´t really leave an impression on me. But I have to say the ED songs were beautiful. Music always depends on your own tastes, so if you did like all of the music tracks in the anime, no hard feelings.<br />
<br />
Characters - 2<br />
<br />
OMG! Never ever have I seen an anime with a lead character this annoying as Aoi Tori in &quot;Horizon&quot;. I felt something was wrong, like he didn´t really belong to this anime. He is just a huge goofball with a playful and perverted nature that will soon get on the nerves of any sane person. I couldn´t comprehend how this was our main character, the one you are supposed to cheer for all the way. Most of the time he goes around with this big smile on his face that just makes me want to punch him and in the second season he runs around stark naked for the most part. Yes, you heard right! I didn´t understand this, like was there any reason for him to do this? Did he lose a bet? I don´t care if he is meant to be a pervert, most of the perverted characters I´ve seen in other animes seem fairly normal in comparison to him. And while he manages to be somewhat helpful to his friends at the end of season one, he is considerably downplayed in the second season, which isn´t really as bad as ist sounds.<br />
This leads us to the other characters, but to be honest, there´s really litte to tell about them. Just that there is a lot of them. While the main character is fairly easy to remember just because he is him, you will find yourself scratching your head looking at the other characters. Very rarely will you get background information about them, e.g. for the main character´s sister Kimi and the automated doll Horizon, but most of the other characterst just have one or two personality traits, which is supposed to count as full characters. I think for the sake of this anime, it would have been a good idea to just leave some of them out. For example this curry-throwing Indian guy and this slime dude. They have no purpose whatsoever. <br />
But if you are a huge sucker for boobs then this is for you. Most of the female characters wear skin-tight jump suits or revealing costumes to entertain you. But it does leaves you wondering, is there some kind of drug in the atmosphere that makes your breasts grow faster? Characters with flat chests are really limited and middle-sized breasts seem to be nearly extinct as most of the female cast has ridiculously huge breasts. Not that I am really complaining, but it does get kinda absurd to the end. <br />
But aside from that, there are some pretty forgettable characters. How about this guy who is supposedly a crown prince or whatever and this girl in a wheel chair, who happen to care for a ghost girl, which appears in the middle of the first season. Except for a few comedic moments the crown prince later starts off, all three of them don´t have anything to do with the story. In fact, the girl in the wheel chair doesn´t seem to even leave her room. What´s the point of that?<br />
 I could point out numerous other problems with this show´s characters, but I will leave it at that. The thing is, we have this complex story line to cope with and then the anime throws all these characters at us, most of them with little to no impact on the story. I liked some of them, but mostly because of their &quot;two features&quot; and not really because of their personality. And if everything you have to offer with your characters are their big busts, then this is truly dreadful.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 5<br />
<br />
It may seem like I didn´t enjoy this flick, which is not the case. Even though the story and the characters are lacking in every aspect, it does leave you wishing to know what will happen to them. The anime doesn´t develop a connection with the characters, which is a big mistake for any kind of story in my opinion, but if you are like me (the kind of person that just automatically forms a bond with the main cast, just because you want to see the &quot;good&quot; guys win over the &quot;bad&quot; guys), you will watch till the end. The anime lacks the tension and suspense necessary for it to truly enjoy it, but it´s not that bad either.<br />
<br />
Overall - 4<br />
<br />
At the end you will be left with a mixed opinion about this show. Even though it fails at so many aspects, it does leave you with the feeling you want to see more even if it´s just to see if everything makes sense at the end. I think the main problem lies in the convoluded story and the big character cast. I think it´s nearly impossible to adapt a series of light novels into a 26-episode anime, if there is so much material to work with. For the animated version, you should have chosen either more story and less characters or vice versa, but not both of them. Maybe it´s just me, but it takes the fun out of it for me, if I have to look everything up when I don´t understand something. Maybe the story did make sense, but it doesn´t change the fact that it is poorly told and has uninteresting characters.

    Ok judge, so the season has ended, judge, so how do I rate this anime? Here&#039;s how, tes:<br />
<br />
Story: Fair 6. Judge.<br />
<br />
First of all this anime still revolves around it&#039;s genre which is action and fantasy, it is still set in the so called &quot;Testament Era&quot;, the only difference, is that this cannot be considered as a season 2 due to the fact that this anime is more of a continuation than a sequel of  season 1. Co&#039;z in season 1 it is more like a declaration of  war of  Musashi on the Testament Union, this time it is about the Musashi doing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73979">
        it  and entering an alliance with England...but not without some fighting involved with the English. Also, the story is more on a political theme in which one has to have a sort of knowledge in the geopolitical aspect of war so as in order for one to be able to follow through the discussion of the character&#039;s. Tes.<br />
<br />
Art: Fair 6. Judge<br />
<br />
I have nothing to say in this part, but is nice that there is still those big bouncing melons (Boink, Boink) going around. Tes<br />
<br />
Sound: Poor 3. Judge<br />
<br />
I simply hate both opening and closing theme&#039;s and I hate Tori&#039;s voice. Tes.<br />
<br />
Character: Very good 8.Judge<br />
<br />
In season 1 it is about Tori and Horizon, what makes character&#039;s good in this season 2 is that it is now Tori&#039;s posses&#039; who are shining, this is probably the only anime where the previous main character is now reduce to a supporting role. In this season 2, Tori has pretty much gone cuckoo and Horizon is more like placed in a reserved role. This time the posses&#039; are doing all the dirty works from hostile negotiations to fighting them Tres Espana. In fact the main character in this season is Masazumi &quot;Seijun&quot; Honda who does a good deal of negotiating, Shirojiro Bertoni who does all the money talk and Kimi who does the back up fighting. But the romantic part between Tenzo and Mary really spice things up. The air to air fight done by Margot and Gacchan is really spectacular. It is really nice that once in a while where the support cast becomes the protagonist, that doesn&#039;t usually happens, so such score is what this part deserves. Tes.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and Overall: Good 7. Judge <br />
<br />
What&#039;s enjoying is seeing Musashi being able to kick the Tres Espana&#039;s ass and putting a place for themselves in the &quot;Testament Union,&quot; however I&#039;m really am disgusted that Tori is running around naked in which it is difficult to say if he plans to bang Horizon or whatever perverted stuff he wants to do with her. The very thing that carries the overall of this season 2 were the students of Ariadust Academy whom were the main cast of this season 2 , also I was wondering as to what happened to the teacher,Makiko Oriotorai? It is a pity that she could have added something to the action genre of this anime if she were to be included. I guess to make Tori a supporting cast ain&#039;t so bad after all. Tes.

    Well season 2 looks more promising than the last season, I can say that for sure because this season has more of a less complicated storyline than the last.Its basically about this organization(led by our main protagonist)   fighting against these English people, simple as that.The anime has great artwork, in both seasons, since its based on a light novel.The anime is funny, and yes there&#039;s over-sized boobs and naked men flying down from the sky,yes, lots of ecchi.The action is great, and yet there&#039;s no blood or people dying.There&#039;s some magic and a little mecha in it also.To me, the action is pointless,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review67233">
        and the main character is pointless.Its just my opinion.

    Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon 2...<br />
<br />
This series is a good futuristic anime.. Well, the story of this is complex, I&#039;m sure you will be confused when you start watching it.. Make sure to start watching the series form season 1 in order to have a good grasp of all the complex concepts involved in this series..<br />
<br />
When I start watching this series, I immediately got confused with names of the characters and the terminologies.. I was like &quot;What the hell is this about again?&quot;. Therefore, I heavily recommend that you should note every character names and the events (from season 1 maybe) so that you can carry

          <span style="display: none;" id="review74229">
        it over to season 2.. (This is no spoiler).. Honestly, it is like reviewing for an exam.. Review the name of each characters.. HAHAHA.. Well, have fun about it..<br />
<br />
So, let&#039;s begin the Fave 6!!<br />
<br />
Story..<br />
I just noticed that the story of the series is more complex and confusing than before.. You know, more terms, more names, more events.. It&#039;s just studying history.. You know, the boring history subject.. If I were you, you need to memorize this one.. In my honest opinion, you&#039;re gonna definitely will get a grasp of the characters. It is because they are too damn entertaining to watch. Well, the main story of this series revolves on recreation of history and other stuff.. <br />
<br />
I also noticed that the direction of the story doesn&#039;t revolved on the main characters.. It revolved on some characters. Characters that were like extra characters in season 1 and now they are the lead characters on season 2. I&#039;m referring to Tenzo Crossunite and Toussaint Neshinbara.. Well, I&#039;m not gonna give the details but one things for sure, the somewhat side story that revolves around them are great. I enjoyed every single one of it.. It&#039;s refreshing.. I had fun.. I am very happy with their parts.. That&#039;s it..<br />
<br />
Art..<br />
The art was definitely great.. The character design are fabulous. Good uniforms.. The girls are beautiful.. I mean all of them are beautiful except those that are designated to be ugly characters. You can fall in love with the beautiful girls because they had it all, good looks and good body.. (You know what I mean right?) The fight scenes are also great.. It is a good show that represents a future concept of what wars will become in the future.. It was freaking awesome..<br />
<br />
Sound..<br />
I&#039;m sure you have seen the opening.. It is a good song.. DAMN!! The ending songs are also good. I think they&#039;ve used two ending songs.. It was cute.. the ending scenes are cute. On the other hand, the opening is action packed.. It&#039;s like it is a preview of what will happen for the whole season..<br />
<br />
Characters..<br />
Aside from the main cast of characters which include Toori and Horizon, here are the characters that really caught my attention..<br />
1) Tenzo Crossunite - This man really shares my fantasy ideals as a man in real life. He clearly states it.. He likes busty blondes.. That is the ultimate truth.. The nirvana for him.. He is like me.. I am fantasizing that kind of lady.. of course in my dreams.. I just find it really hilarious.. Not only that, he really stood out in this season because of the incident with Mary.. I really loved this series because of him.. I salute you Tenzo Crossunite!!<br />
2) Toussaint Neshinbara - Another one of those guys that somewhat stole the spotlight from this season.. His presence though is not the same as Tenzo.. But, he is also fun to watch.. Why? It&#039;s because of some individual named Shakespeare. (I will not give the details) I enjoyed his scenes especially when he is with Shakespeare..<br />
3) Mary - She is really hot.. A perfect body proportion in terms of anime reality.. The voice actress has a sweet voice.. It fits into the character.. Nice Yui Horie..<br />
<br />
Enjoyment..<br />
DAMN!! I enjoyed every second of it.. It has action, comedy, romance etc... I am watching a walkthrough of Darksiders and I temporarily dropped it because this show. It has a spark that made me finished it in one blitz.. This show is awesome... That&#039;s it..<br />
<br />
Overall..<br />
Well, this show have a complex story.. Sometimes they are terms that will come out of the blue.. Sometimes they are things that you really can&#039;t understand.. Sometimes I got lost on some conversations between the characters.. But there are the things that are enjoyable in exchange with those confusing moments.. You will enjoy the things that I will dub as &quot;obvious&quot;. &quot;Obvious&quot; in a sense that every viewer will definitely understand that kind of scenario.. (If you get what I am saying..) <br />
<br />
So, good luck.. I know that you will not lose in the middle of the story.. It is really enjoyable..<br />
<br />

    Second season was something I kind of expected, now just for a third one...  I was so intrigued by part 1 that I wanted to knock this out as soon as possible so I could see everything on the internet and not be spoiled.  There is just too much that I would love to see done with this show.<br />
<br />
Story: Same as last time, stays a bit confusing until a little later or you do research, but they make it a bit simpler and if you remember anything from season 1 you should be in a pretty good state of knowing what is happening.<br />
<br />
Art:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173253">
        Stayed that same as the last one, with a very clean look, but used the same tricks as last time.  While that didn&#039;t kill it, I would have liked to see some new things in it.  Did a good job with most of what else needed to happen.<br />
<br />
Sound: Here is where I was a bit disappointed.  They changed the voice actors for one, so whoever you think you knew sounded, they don&#039;t except for a few who stayed the same.  The intro song changed again, and while still good just doesn&#039;t feel the same as before.  They also used the same background musics, so if they could breath some new life into that it would have been a bit better.<br />
<br />
Character: People&#039;s backstories are elaborated like crazy in this, using flashbacks and building a lot more than they did last time.  At some points it got confusing since things overlapped but that was slightly overseeable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Kept the same pace as last time.  Plenty of moments with heart-to-heart and laughing and action again that will catch you up so much that you need to stop or rewind to see it again.<br />
<br />
Overall: Wasn&#039;t as good as last time with the changes since people sound kind of weird with the VA changes, making you think they&#039;re a different person.  They had a good job with the new storyline, but it felt like some moments were still confusing and lost moments.<br />
<br />
Sill a fantastic series I would love to see going since this season ended with a terrible cliffhanger.  The only things that need to change are really just small little tweaks and possibly more simple elaboration before getting complicated.  All in all though, still a great series beyond belief

    Well, I came to watch this after I take quite some time to understand the first season.<br />
My expectation was high after I watched the frist season, then at the end of that day I finished watching this second season. I feel satisfy.<br />
Perhaps this is one of the animes that make me feel like waiting for next season to be aired.<br />
<br />
Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon 3, I am waiting for you  :)

    This is perhaps an anime for the well-educated, and those who are rather interested in politics and the way of economics.. because in some ways, this is an anime that reflects the deeper side of society. The complexity of this anime naturally means it&#039;s going to be slow. And it is. Very much so.<br />
<br />
As a direct sequel from season 1, you need to watch both seasons to understand what the hell is happening, even just vaguely. The story itself is twisted and very indirect. There&#039;s literally no telling where the story&#039;s going. For example, after the appearance of &quot;X&quot; (avoiding spoilers :P), you&#039;d think &quot;X&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review74831">
        would be the centre of attention in the next i.e. this season. But no... &quot;X&quot; took up the screen for 10 mins. Just 10 mins. What the hell? After a MASSIVE cliffhanger, they just exit the bloody set!! WHAT THE HELL????<br />
<br />
Never minding the cock-up of sorts, we enter the realm of the SLOWEST anime, or at least in my opinion, ever. 2 seasons, 26 episodes, and we&#039;ve not even covered the important bits yet. Like the backgrounds of the majority of characters (including some minor ones). Okay, if we&#039;re talking about episode numbers, 100s more animes have more that 26 episodes. But after 26 episodes, most animes would&#039;ve wrapped up the goal/objective of the characters and the entire plot e.g. One Piece wants... well, one piece :)<br />
<br />
However, the political side of this anime might be the cause. You know, political affairs in real life take up more time than you imagine... and this anime&#039;s kinda politically orientated. So I guess we could excuse the Sun-spinning slowness... sorta.<br />
<br />
And thus, I conclude my review. Once again, I thank you all who actually bothered to read this (not many I&#039;d imagine). And remember this... I am neutral, so don&#039;t expect a biased review from me :&gt;  Unless it is very sh!t &gt;_&lt;

    If you haven&#039;t watched the first season, bare through the first few episodes as they set the background. If you can not enjoy it after that, then this show isn&#039;t for you (at that time). I write at that time because I did not like the series when it first aired. Weekly, it was confusing, cluttered, bothersome design, and etc. Then I tried it a few years later and was blown away.<br />
<br />
So, season two. While the design initially could have been not as voluptuous, it eventually became part of the character. Kimi would not be Kimi if she did not have her assets. Nor Masazumi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207426">
        for that matter. The best thing is this season isn&#039;t about Aoi/P-01 but Hanzo. Typically, a lot of confusion is arisen at this point as to why the main characters aren&#039;t &quot;main&quot; anymore but they are...in an overarching manner. The story becomes more than just a boy fighting the world to save the one he loves. So much more light is shown on his companions (well, a few got lessen) and why they would fight with him and her. Its a grand narrative that some year, may be graced with a third season.<br />
<br />
As for negatives...I&#039;d still say the character design but I&#039;ve grown to love them as stated so meh. And the history. To be concise, disaster happened in the past so everyone is recreating history as a guidance. I think. It gets confusing sometimes initially but its not like, you won&#039;t get the story if you&#039;re not a history buff. The anime does as much as it can to be understandable.<br />
<br />
Its good.

    This is my first anime review on this site, and here i thought. Wow this series is very underrated on this site, but it can be explained why. Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon II stated off from where the first season left off. The series is about how humanity wanted to re *do* their historical events so that they are evolve to where ancient evolution fell. The story is mainly set on Japanese historical events which is difficult for foreign viewers to understand, which is the main reason why this series is very underrated and also one of it&#039;s flaws. <br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
The story is not epic nor

          <span style="display: none;" id="review90629">
        perfect, its very difficult to understand, especially for foreign viewers. Even a little difficult for native viewers. The series adapts the novel very well, the novel is indeed very thick in cover and have a lot of information, taken examples... The first season of Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon is taken action in just 2 days, you can imagine how thick the first chapter is. However Sunrise adapted the series perfectly and understandable for T.V sized information.<br />
<br />
The story it self sets in a Gakuen(School) ship Musashi and follows with the main cast, leading with Aoi Toori, Our perverted protagonist. As i explained above, this series focus on re *doing* the historical events happened in the past so that they can once more move up to where they fell. Although some of the historical events are a little different than the original and yet there lies the epicness of this series.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
Nothing to be said more, Sunrise is one of the top producing company in Japan aside Kyouto Animation. The art style used in this series fits to those *Moe 2-D Bishoujos* with indescribably large breats. Some youngsters call it *fan service* which is bull shit, because *fan service* are one of the very important moe point in anime industry. Unlike Kyouto Animation which used very realistic 3-D art style. The background animation in this series is done very well, including the buildings, fights, character designs. For the T.V version, it&#039;s very rarely to spot on broken arts on the character and background. The actions, and the super effects are done amazingly well and unique to most of the animes, expected from Sunrise.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
The OST used in this series is undoubtedly one of the bests in anime industry. The BMG fits perfectly with the art and animation. Through out the whole series it can bring goose bumps all over your body.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
The characters are awesomely developed with each character&#039;s personality and habit. Unlike most of the Shounen anime, where it takes about 2-4 episodes to show one character and in the end its crap loaded with unneeded information which brings the opposite effect. Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon however tooks about half to one episode to describe the character&#039;s personality and how she/he is related to Aoi Toori and the story, and it gets you hooked to the character more. Each one of character is named after each hero that fought in epic historical events in the past.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
One of the flaws is the story setting in this anime... Many viewers can&#039;t quite understand whats going on in the anime, well it can&#039;t be blamed because normally anime viewers are aged around 13-17, and many of them don&#039;t know most of the historical events happened in *Japan*. However, Sunrise adapted it very well, making it a lot easier to understand and once you understands the story, the rest just flows.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
One of the anime that really grabs the viewers into the original creators head and enjoy the whole story without the viewer&#039;s subjective crap and just enjoy what is given. Really enjoyable series, recommended to all viewers, don&#039;t be shy, ask if you don&#039;t understand, in the end you&#039;re only helping you self.<br />
<br />
PS. If you can&#039;t stand *fan services* and other shit. It only means you&#039;re still young. Stop judging on it... you&#039;re making you self look retarded and childness.

    TBH going into Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon I was not expecting what I came out with.<br />
<br />
Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon had been sitting in my plan to watch for some time now and finally decided to watch it. In the beginning, I was so confused by everything that was happening. But over time the story began to clean up and I could understand it more.<br />
<br />
If your looking for a quick watch and have seen the first season of Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon, I recommended sticking and watching season 2 out for its great sound design and character development from the supporting roles. <br />
<br />
Overall, Kyoukai Senjou no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373227">
        Horizon II is a small enjoyable watch and if you want more the light novel is finished and has been translated. <br />
<br />
My Overall Score Is 7 (Good)

    Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon II is just the previous season but more refined. That is the greatest understatement to be said about it. This time around the story is much more focused and concentrated right off the bat. Any confusion is quickly resolved by the anime itself. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story is once again simple and straightforward, however it is presented much more clearly. This allows for more character development and interaction between the cast. It again suffers from some problems from the previous season. For example most viewers would lose some effect of the characters (name/title) if they are not exactly the history geek. This is very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review108401">
        minor as the characters themselves do a very good job of creating their own persona and place in the anime.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The artstyle stay mostly the same again with some improvments in the effects and character design.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The soundtrack once again delivers. It includes several of the old tracks as well as some new ones that again fits perfectly with the anime.<br />
<br />
Character: <br />
This. This is what makes this anime awesome. Aoi Tori might have less of a impact onto the story this time, but the rest of the cast steps up into the spotlight. It&#039;s very rare that an anime can make the cast entirely likeable and unique as well. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: <br />
The battles remain as strange and awesome as they were last season, the characters remain as enjoyable as always, soundtrack is stunning, and the story is much more refined. This anime is one of the few ones that i keep rewatching every 3-5 months<br />
<br />
Overall: <br />
Overall the story wraps up with a good fulfilled ending yet still leaves things open for continuing which only succeeds in making me hope other season comes to grace us fans.<br />
<br />

    Its so rare sight to see that sequel didn&#039;t ruin the spirit of original. But in the case of Horizon this situation took place. If you liked 1st season, there is practically no reason for you not to watch 2nd one)

    Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon II is the sequel to Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon. Like the first season it is either a hit or miss.<br />
<br />
Story:8<br />
The first season&#039;s story was confusing, as the first four episodes would be a challenge to overcome. But for this season the story started strong and ended strong with many puzzling events(though they hint throughout the story which I made a prediction and was right)<br />
The romance is strong,  and  the blend of fantasy and historic elements were perfect.<br />
The comedy is very random and amazing but is a hit of miss as some jokes are just . . .<br />
The story is still the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review76865">
        same but more complicated, it still about Horizon obtaining her emotions but now with more romance, action, and funny scenes. There is also a better understanding of the setting as it makes &quot; more&quot; sense.<br />
<br />
Art:9<br />
<br />
The art is fantastic, as all the actions scenes are drawn and transition nicely. It can be seen how much work they did working on the art. <br />
The character designs were great as I can easily identify each character as they are all uniquely drawn.<br />
<br />
Sound:8<br />
<br />
The opening and ending songs were okay. But the songs they used for all the fighting it really fitted the atmosphere and shines throughout the entire seasons.<br />
Especially the first and last episode where the sound was a perfect 10.<br />
<br />
Character:9<br />
This would had been a perfect 10 but the main character had very few times to shine and i felt there was little character development and was kinda annoying for him to be naked 24/7.<br />
But the good thing like the first season is the varied and unique characters, the season explains more about them.<br />
This season was more about the other characters and how they make Tori shine throughout the series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:10<br />
The actions scenes were great as the sound and art have many effort put in, the negotiation and fun/comedic scenes were great for me though <br />
I enjoyed this season and the series so far. The setting and story was less confusing from the first season as there is more of an understanding of what is happening. <br />
<br />
Overall 9:<br />
<br />
I say this is an overall improvement from the first  season as if you are watching this season it meant you went through the first season and all of the confusion of the first couple episodes before everything started to make sense. Unlike the first season, the beginning and ending of the season was strong.<br />
<br />
<br />
The confusing slow building story with more romance than before, with amazing art, sound, and comedy that would either be hit or miss, but if you are watching season two it means you must have liked the jokes. The characters are still strong as more and more characters are added into the story.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is my first review and i tried not being biased as much as possible . . . but I love this series and is one of my favorites.

    Ill start this one off like i did for S1 stating I am late to this show. Overall though I found this season to be slightly better then the last could have been much better for one reason that I will get into shortly.<br />
<br />
The story of the Second season starts off fairly slow like it did in the first. instead of going through several renditions of the same day though this one sets up the plot more directly which helps it out a bit later. This one here has a place that is set well again kinda set in the early modern era but due

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321158">
        to tech is a bit off.. though the story writers get the feel right on it which is most important. it also incorporates some aspects from the Arthurian legend along with introducing some deeper world building with several nods to the standards for the various races that live in the world. Definitely a solid showing for the second season.<br />
<br />
The sound on this one is also a bit better. Still solid opening and closing the music in between though was definitely a bit more polished this go around.<br />
<br />
Now to the characters, The old characters are all here. This here is also a show that believes no matter how many times you get stabbed noone can ever die even if it would be more impact full overall for them to but that&#039;s a side gripe. There is a little building on some old characters and there are of course a bevy of new characters which have some interesting personalities.. The &quot;MC&quot; did kinda drag the show down a bit.. For some reason the story writers decided he should be naked 80+% of the time, which though in and of itself isn&#039;t.. bad.. it also throws off some scenes that would otherwise be much better if he were excluded or if they gags his nudity provokes were excluded. This perhaps is the Biggest drawback to the show. The secondary MC whom is the shows namesake does get some development and even the &quot;MC&quot; has a bit or at least his motivations get a bit of explaining.<br />
<br />
With that said i would still recommend the show. there are several good points to it and it is a shame there hasn&#039;t been a 3rd season. Despite it all the first two seasons feel like an opening.. much like the first couple episodes of the seasons.. which giving how each ramp up means the plots would really take off in another.

    This is really good anime, the story line quite heavy since its not like common action anime who have 1 till 3 main characters. By doing many characters of course the story quite confusing to some people since this anime want give all the characters their own story so not just focused on few characters all the times.<br />
<br />
The art really nice and smooth, personally this is my most favorite art type in anime, i really really love it.<br />
<br />
Some of review says this anime don&#039;t have good song like &quot;K-*N&quot; well its whole different genre this is action fantasy not slice of life or musical school

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252430">
        band.<br />
<br />
The characters design is unique even this anime have really a lot of characters almost every each of them don&#039;t have any similarity including the uniform (except the &quot;armies&quot; or &quot;troops&quot;)<br />
<br />
Personally I really love and really enjoy watching this anime, too bad its stopped in season 2, but i hope one day there is season 3 in the future.
