    SPOILER FREE! This review is going to be split into two parts: subjective and objective (or the difference between my heart and my mind).<br />
<br />
We&#039;ll start with OBJECTIVE. The art is aesthetically pleasing and the character designs are unique enough that you don&#039;t mix up anyone. It pulls off both serious and cutesy expressions very well, but that&#039;s standard for shoujo. It also showed me a male outfit that made me go &quot;WTF&quot; in the same way I look at the suits in Kill la Kill.<br />
<br />
The animation is mediocre at best. The fights are nice towards the end but the beginning is pretty lazily done (a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173521">
        sound effect and a flash). I said before the interspersed serious and cutesy art is nice, but they really don&#039;t transition well animation wise. There are some parts which are jarring and completely take you out of the story. <br />
<br />
Character wise, the three brothers and shirasu (and their relationship) were well developed, considering this is a 12 episode series. Some people might find the third brother, Chuutaro, to be a bit annoying but it doesn&#039;t detract too much overall. Everyone else is pretty one note in terms of personality. It&#039;s really just from the size of the cast and the amount of backstory that had to be crammed into this. Despite the fact that they all love to blab about their pasts,  it ends up feeling like you missed out on a lot of characters.<br />
<br />
When it comes to story, Donten suffers most from its clumsy exposition. The first episode starts off introducing the characters, the setting, and all that jazz in a pretty standard way. But then it drags on and on into the next episodes because it needs to introduce so many other characters and establish their connection to the main plot, most which is dropped on you like a brick in the form of an episode long flashback. The romance is also mediocre, considering it&#039;s between a tsundere chick and a hopelessly devoted dude, though fans of reincarnated lovers probably will like it. <br />
<br />
Set up aside, however, the execution of the second half of the series is excellent. The action is gripping, the plot twists leave you stunned, and the pay off is emotionally satisfying (or crippling, depending on your tastes). There are a couple, not so much plot points, but character motivations, that are unresolved at the end.<br />
<br />
With that said, SUBJECTIVELY, I adore this anime. I love all of the character designs so much. The girls are pretty and the boys are hot, and that&#039;s enough for me. None of the characters were unnecessary or unlikeable and the story put them all to good use. I loved all the plot twists even the one I saw coming because it&#039;s timed so well. Every episode left me itching to watch another one and I&#039;m not ashamed to admit that I cried. I also love the romance as cliched as it is, and I ship two other couples. I would totally watch this again, painful exposition and all!<br />
<br />
tl:dr Don&#039;t judge this one until you get to the end.

    Like I usually do, I go to my favorite anime website every season and watch the 1st episode of each anime. If I&#039;m somewhat into it, I usually stick around; and this one caught my attention.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
Basically it&#039;s your typical good vs evil anime with the good guys primarily focusing on the 3 brothers, while the 1st two older brothers are far more interesting, the third and youngest...well honestly could&#039;ve done without him. Didn&#039;t really do much or affect much of the story except for maybe like 5 or 10 minutes of the story in ALL of the series. Really. Like your typical good vs evil

          <span style="display: none;" id="review176437">
        anime, there are happy times, then tough times and then reunion and then happy time again, gee..didn&#039;t see that coming. Honestly it didn&#039;t really blow me away or anything. It was a pretty typical setting I&#039;ve seen a billion times in all the anime I&#039;ve watched...and trust me I&#039;ve watched quite a lot. At best it was mediocre. Nothing special.<br />
<br />
Art <br />
Honestly, it was pretty average. It&#039;s clear they didn&#039;t get much to work with or else it might have been better. Seemed very early 2000&#039;s low budget standards to me. Lots of stills, little action in the fighting, repeated scenes, etc. The usual in a low budget anime. <br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Nothing really caught my attention. None of the music did or had me humming (that&#039;s when you know you got someone hooked) one of the tunes, nothing. Pretty repetitive as well. The younger brother, Chutaro was annoying as hell. I guess they did an ok job in choosing his VA if that was the intent. The other VA&#039;s I have heard of and they did well. <br />
<br />
Characters<br />
I guess if there&#039;s an upside to this anime it&#039;s the characters, while Chutaro was annoying, Tenka and Soramaru were probably more enjoyable. Honestly I wished they had developed Soramaru more, but being 12 episodes I guess they couldn&#039;t afford it. It felt kind of rushed or forced near the end where Soramaru tries to move on after a tragic event, so therefore I didn&#039;t really feel much for his suffering and cause. Honestly, I thought it started off great with the characters, but by the last few episodes, character development went out the window and in came the terrible typical story. I was kind of disappointed in that. They had great characters to work with. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I wanted to enjoy it, but there is just so much lacking that I found myself just kind of yawning at times. It was exciting at times, but at times it was boring. It felt like your typical filler anime and probably was. A pretty mediocre anime with ok characters, easily forgettable in my opinion. I give it a low 6/10.

    Donten ni Warau (Laughing Under the Clouds) is a rare breed. I say this for its ability to tell a story guided by events of the past with a greater focus for the future. Taking place in the present time with a trio of brothers, they have the duty of ferrying convicted criminals as result of high levels of crime rate. That’s the least of their concern though as we find out a malevolent legend known as the ‘Orochi’ that lurks from the past. Should we even call it a legend? It’s known that every 300 years, the Orochi will reincarnate to bring forth destruction.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178976">
        Brace yourself for a story of the fantasy coming ages.<br />
<br />
The series is based off of the manga the same name written by Karakara-Kemuri with two other prequels taking place some separate centuries before its current timeline. Regardless, the show initially establishes its premise and the first introductory episodes makes it well known for our main characters to focus on the Kamoh family. The three brothers are Tenka, Soramaru, and Chutaro. Although their personalities contrast with one another, it’s easy to see how close they are. It’s fairly important to notice how their relationships are crafted as later events have great influences on their roles. <br />
<br />
Background story reveals much about the series’ past and also the present conditions of the timeline. It’s a series where you will feel the spirit of the story infusing elements of its themes and characters. From the beginning, the show easily tells itself with the characters’ duties of ferrying convicted felons to a prison known as the Gokumonjo, a stronghold located around Lake Biwa. We are shown exactly what goes on inside the prison as well as how the brothers delivers their duties. The show transits between scenarios to show their daily lives and duties as the primary introduction. What I find the initial introduction of the series to be attractive is its honesty especially in regards with the relationship with the brothers. Some of the scenes may be a bit silly at times but never loses its grip to focus on how close the brothers really are. As such, it’s a sincere story as will be reflected by later events that changes everyone’s lives forever. And if “Orichi” is part of that vocabulary, then it makes the experience that much more galvanizing.<br />
<br />
The most important element of the show is easily the characters. A great deal of time is used to give them depth whether it’s the mature Tenka, a youthful Soramaru, or the childish Chutaro. All three of them possesses different personalities that gives the audience a stark insight on their characters. To say the least though, it’s easy to tell that the show focuses on Soramaru the most with his roles. As the second eldest of the family, Soramaru is apparently entrusted with a pair of family swords that he practices with each day. And through that practice, we can see him as a potentially great warrior in development. There’s a bit of inferiority complex shown throughout the series as we see him desperately trying to catch up to his older brother Tenka in skill. Meanwhile, we also have the young Chutaro who worships his older brother Tenka like an idol. Foremost, Tenka is a mysterious character who holds his duties as sacred and to always be a guardian for his younger brothers. However, the show shifts to a different scenario where he himself becomes endangered by a mysterious power. The way the show handles itself is quite riveting when you see how quickly the mood can change. <br />
<br />
Other characters also play prominent roles as part of the story whether it’s the Fuuma family such as Shirasu and his brother. If we look at it carefully, family plays key roles in this show to create a sense of respect and nobility. However, just be aware of plot twists such as those involving Shirasu’s roles later on in the series. And while not romantic love isn’t explicit, the show isn’t shy to turn heads away from it either. From a personal narrative format, Hirai and Botan has a connection that is told creatively through flashbacks and even an episode dedicated for the duo. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the show is built on connections either based on reputation, family bonds, or love. It’s where the series truly shines with its powerful emotions.<br />
<br />
As a supernatural fantasy, expect the unexpected with elements that breaks the law of nature. The most prominent example is the Orichi, a powerful deity that has potential to destroy the world. Others include the important role of Botan, a familiar with gifted abilities. Other spirits and beings that exists in the series are common folklore creatures such as shikigami. While not showing much originality, the series showcases almost every one of their potentials. Action scenes are well coordinated with a solid foundation of the fantasy genre. I also find some of the mystery mixed with the fantasy elements to be suspenseful when plot twists play a role for its larger story plot. A show that decorates itself with creative characters and detailed story is a rare breed and this anime is no stranger to that.<br />
<br />
Artwork on most parts is delicate and decorated enough to create bring this fantasy story to life. I give the praise for some of the more sincere scenarios that are especially concentrated with high degree of visual focus. This applies to serene flashback scenes as well as moments of emotional drama. Another noticeable factor are the character designs that may be pleasing to the ladies. Most of the male characters have some bishonen traits. To be fitting for the more dark side of the show, the Orichi is designed to truly look malevolent with monstrous attributes. Last but not least is the setting with high volumes of natural features such as the landscapes and more noticeable, Lake Biwa.<br />
<br />
I can’t say the soundtrack is a powerhouse because most of the time, it just seems to be there. However, two noticeable traits for the soundtrack are the character voice expressions to convey their feelings. This is expressively shown later on when the brothers goes through hard times in their lives. The other trait is the OP and ED song with great details and decorative coordination. OST is on par for most parts but artwork outshines this department. I do give praise to some of the soundtrack for the action though as it almost gives some episodes a cinematic feeling especially for pivotal scenes.<br />
<br />
To put it simply, this show is a resonant saga with events from the past infused with storytelling of the present. And with a colorful cast of characters, it’s a presence to be remembered for their roles. All sort of feelings are bought out throughout the story that are not just told but shown to make the audience feel as if they are there themselves. Despite some predictable outcomes, the story remains honest with its premise with engaging dialogues and balanced comedy. This show is an underdog that registers every worth of time that should be invested into.<br />

    Major spoilers. Beware.<br />
<br />
I came across this anime by pure coincidence.  Out of the very few fall anime in my “to watch” list, Donten ni Warau was not in consideration. But out of boredom, I decided to watch the then released 3 episodes of this anime and I was undoubtedly hooked. Personally, I thought that this anime was just to my tastes. An anime that focuses on brothers’ relation with a cool (yet doting) big brother, a haughty middle brother (with a complex) and a cute little brother with an interesting speech pattern.<br />
<br />
This anime was perfect. It made me laugh, cry and a feel a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173213">
        fluster of various other emotions. But then came episode 7 and that’s where things go wrong. Awfully wrong.<br />
<br />
After an extremely emotional episode the last thing you would expect from the next episode would be a back story of a random character. I’ll be honest, this pissed me off greatly. I don’t care whether the back story was necessary or not (seemed like unnecessary romance sub-plot to me but I might just be bias) but it was almost inappropriate to deviate (in fact neglect) the death of the main character and the aftermath of such tragedy on the brothers in such a way. <br />
In the following episode, I was more than ready to forget the previous episode’s pacing until Soramaru got over the death of his brother in an extremely baffling way in a single episode. Perhaps “getting over” isn’t the right phrase here but nevertheless, his optimistic attitude was sudden and seemed almost out of character for a person who was so obsessed with surpassing his brother.<br />
<br />
This wasn’t enough to make me dislike the show though. After all, I had already gotten attached to the characters of the anime more than I was expecting. And perhaps because I liked the characters so much, I was appalled at “unexpected plot twist” of this anime. It wouldn’t exactly be wrong to say the twist was kind of cliché; but more than that, to me, it was low. The kindest character turns out to be the villain, has a twin partner-in-crime, and his background was a farce. Oh shocker!<br />
<br />
Normally, I would’ve rolled my eyes at such a development. But having previously felt touched by how Shirasu was saved by Tenka and in return swore loyalty to the Kumou family, I was disheartened more than anything at the revelation. And so even though it turns out that Shirasu&#039;s background was a sham and he had ulterior motive all along, I can’t bring myself to hate the character. Rather than that, I can’t help but blame the author since it was the kind of plot twist that isn’t exhilarating or exciting but instead simply disappointing to the point I couldn’t wholeheartedly enjoy what happened afterwards (including Tenka’s return, unfortunately). Now I know that it was hinted that Shirasu is still attached to the Kumou&#039;s but the fact that he wouldn&#039;t be together with them doesn&#039;t sits well with me. <br />
<br />
As far as the sound and art is concerned, DnW has pretty standard art with smooth action scenes with no major flaws. The opening and ending songs are suitable for the mood of the anime. The ending song especially was one of my favorite of the season. The background music is very fitting for a historical anime and overall had a very pleasing feeling.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the first half of this anime more than anything. In fact, I’m extremely dejected at how I gradually lost interest in an anime that I considered was bound to be one of my top favorites this season.  But despite all my nitpicking and complains, I was satisfied that the anime at least had a happy ending. It’s a shame that Donten ni Warau couldn’t be a “masterpiece” for me, but it was a compelling anime nevertheless.

    My sister and I like historical anime and we got interested in it. First few episodes were in, my opinion, boring. I know they were needed; to meet them, get familiar with their past etc. At that time I really considered on dropping it... but I&#039;m so glad I didn&#039;t. I think the real plot twist starts somewhere around the fifth episode as a real shock. From that point onward there was nothing else except surprises.<br />
<br />
Story is unique and it doesn&#039;t left out any characters. I&#039;m really considering on reading the manga. I wasn&#039;t sure should I give the story 9 or 8 because of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173211">
        the one little detail in the last episode, but I think it deserves that 9.<br />
<br />
Art was nice, as any new anime coming out. I didn&#039;t like the look of the characters at first, but you get used to it after some time. Beside that, there isn&#039;t anything bad to say about the art.<br />
<br />
Sound is nice. I really liked the ending and some soundtracks. The reason why I gave it 7 is because of the opening. I really find them important and I keep openings of all anime I watched on my phone. First opening wasn&#039;t really good, but I liked the song of the second one.<br />
<br />
Characters were fine. Some of them are amazing and some aren&#039;t. I really liked Botan&#039;s past and beside her my favorite character is Sousei (partly because of his voice actor).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and overall got 9 from me, because Donten ni Warau is really an  anime worth watching.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading.

    SpoilerFree Summary [tl;dr]-&gt; this anime focuses on the character development and human interaction mainly, while the story and the combats develops too fast and time to time the events seems out of place or rather rushed. While that&#039;s to be expected with having just 12 episodes, if you are into details and mainly give importance to the plot, you may not feel utterly satisfied with Donten.<br />
<br />
However, if what you&#039;re looking for is not the actions and that you don&#039;t mull over details of the plot; but like human drama, interection between the characters and especially brotherly love, you&#039;ll probably like Donten, as it&#039;s a warm&amp;lovely

**Possible SPOILERS Ahead**<br />

<br />
<br />
Main (Detailed) Summary;<br />
<br />
Story is good and rather interesting, however it develops too fast, literally starts and ends in the last 2 episodes. Thus there are some unsolved points, and seemingly out of place or rushed events, like the introduction of some characters to the main story or its time to time forced plot twist. <br />
<br />
The art is rather eyecatching, like the portrayal of the Kumo brothers and the Fuma with same characteristics, and the voice acting is welldone. As usual, Kaji Yuki voices rather a rebel character, wellfit to his vivid voice, Soramaru. We have Nakamaru Yuuichi&#039;s bright voice for the big brother Tenka and Sakurai Takahiro&#039;s mild voice for Shirasu together with Hakuouki&#039;s SaitoHajime, Toriumi Kousuke, as the chief, Abe no Sousei with his calm voice; all wellfit for their respective characters. We even have Miki Shinichiro voicing a rather out of placed character, Kagami Naoto, keeping him interesting; while this interest is rather futile to give to this utterly unimportant character.<br />
<br />
Interactions between the characters are one of the best portrayal among the animes I&#039;ve seen and is the main reason I found Donten loveable. Even the seemingly unrelated characters such as Kagami and Takeda go along well with the mains. While Kagami still seems out of place in the plot, as if he were only there to give the little brother some screentime, the relationship of the two gives a rather warm feeling; and same can be said with Takeda while his relationship with Soramaru is much more well-developed and natural.<br />
There is some sort of a rushed romance between &#039;solely-there-for-the-main-plot&#039; characters, which is rather confusing and time to time absurd. However this being the reason, I didn&#039;t understand it enough to comment on it, as the character development of the two seemed rather rushed as well.<br />
<br />
Overall [my own opinion] -&gt; apart from the main Orochi story, but due to its warm and time to time funny interactions between the characters, I enjoyed this anime.<br />

    Donten ni Warau also known as Laughing Under the Clouds(which after finishing the anime, the title makes a lot of sense to me now!) looks like a series that is pretty generic at first, but it really isn&#039;t. <br />
<br />
The show centers around the relationship between the three Komou brothers - Tenka, the oldest, Soramaru, the &#039;middle brother&#039;, and Chuutarou, the youngest, and the events that go on around them.<br />
<br />
Now, onto the review!<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10 <br />
The story was very interesting, mainly focusing on the brothers&#039; relationship(will go into their relationship in the characters section), and the &quot;Orochi&#039;s Vessel&quot; that appears once in a few hundred years ?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181517">
        (not sure of the time...). The story was very good, keeping me interested enough to keep watching. Keeping this short to avoid any spoilers.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation: 7/10<br />
The art was good, there were a few things that stood out, but the rest was good, decent animation. I personally loved the design on their eyes, I kept pausing just to look at their eyes sometimes.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
I don&#039;t know, there wasn&#039;t anything that I really enjoyed, though the Opening and Ending songs were all good.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
<br />
Now this is where I think the anime got everything right, with character development and personalities and more!<br />
Tenka - The &quot;Fatherly&quot; brother of the family, he had to take on this role because their parents were murdered when they were younger. He does everything for his younger brothers, protecting them, raising them, going as far as he can to keep them from danger.<br />
Soramaru - The &quot;Middle&quot; brother of the family, always striving to be as strong as Tenka, trying to live up to his older brother. I didn&#039;t really like his character much first, he was somewhat annoying and edgy, try way too hard to be relevant and not looking at the little things and just being content with his brothers. All my opinions changed when that big reveal happened (for no spoilers I won&#039;t say what it is) I, for lack of other words, &quot;Saw the light&quot; of how good of a character he was. We were meant to be annoyed by him and his actions, and that is why he was a beautifully made character.<br />
Chuutarou - The Youngest brother he always wants the family to stay together, and after the certain event happened, he sort of withdraw into himself, losing his usual happy attitude. With influence from a minor character, he almost turns evil - wanting to take revenge on certain people.<br />
Shirasu - To avoid spoilers, I will only say that THIS guy brought back my interest in the show when it started to get kinda boring.<br />
Wow, that was long.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, the comedy had me laughing every time, and relationships between the characters were spot on. The plot twists kept the story very interesting.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
Even though the Art and Sound weren&#039;t very special in my mind, everything else in this anime made up for that. Characters/Story are the main parts that I judge on, and both were amazing.

    I don&#039;t quite remember the last time I actually watched an ancient-themed anime since Fushigi Yuugi. If there is, I probably have forgotten about it.<br />
<br />
So Donten ni Warau was really underrated this Fall 2014. It deserves more attention! Like really, I had fun watching this series!<br />
<br />
The bond between the Kumoh brothers is really admirable. Tenka as the eldest is really effective. At first sight he might look like just another fun-loving big brother, but he&#039;s more than that. The people in their village pretty much love him because of their family&#039;s reputation.<br />
<br />
Soramaru and Chuutaro as the younger brothers is really cute too. Soramaru is admirable

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173193">
        because of his determination to keep up (or even overcome) with his older brother. Chuutaro acts as the foundation of their relationship for he is the youngest. Like... he serves as the supply of happiness for the three of them.<br />
<br />
Story-wise: It&#039;s really amazing! But then, I pretty much predicted some parts of the series. But I ca&#039;t deny that the plot twist was clever.<br />
<br />
Animation: I haven&#039;t seen this kind of art style before, so I can say it&#039;s refreshing and new to my eyes.<br />
<br />
Music: Awesome. The music is very well-coordinated to every scenes. Thumbs up to the OP and ED too.<br />
<br />
Characters: Yes! SUPER YES FROM ME! Everybody is lovable (Yes, even Shirasu). Tenka is my most favorite, followed by Chuutaro and Abe no Sosei (MAN! Sosei can kick some ass!).<br />
<br />
OVERALL: I give it a 8.9 out of 10. I really enjoyed the ride of Donten ni Warau. This anime also made me love my own siblings too. Full of life lessons, of course! :)

    This review only applies for the first 4 episodes of the series, it does not constitute for the overall experience of the anime itself and it will be comprised of what I liked/disliked about the anime and the reason I have had dropped it for.<br />
<br />
What interested me in this anime was its mix of genres, which are: Action, Historical, Shoujo. This struck me as odd since I didn&#039;t really expect this mix of genres to exist, but after I&#039;ve checked, apparently there are a few anime that contain this mix of genres. They are about 8 and Donten ni Warau is the most popular of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239895">
        the bunch. This has lead me towards not knowing what exactly to expect from the series. I mean, there were some things I accurately predicted beforehand, like the action being lackluster and avoiding to get really violent in order for the demographic of pre-teen and teenage girls to not be turned off by the violence, with it mostly focusing on making the pretty boys prove their dominance. <br />
<br />
But when I&#039;ve noticed is that it is genred as historical, I assumed there would have some degree of historical commentary rather than it merely being a setting due to what I read in the synopsis of the anime. So I&#039;ve had some expectations that were shattered and may have affected my viewing of it. It is set in an era of Japan after the government has had banned the citizens from carrying swords, when the westernization of Japan was beginning. I assume there would be some commentary on the different mindsets of the era, or the direct consequences on the people of that era. Instead, the samurais are displayed as cartoonishly evil and reacting with muh swurds, with them being criminals that are hunted by the police to be taken on a prison island, because they refuse to adapt. The setting, the ban on swords that broke the samurai, doesn&#039;t seem to hold any purpose other than the existence of that prison, and some degree of relatability with the japanese public. Rather than explore the direct social consequence of that law, this anime chose to create a family of three brothers that were orphaned. It focuses on three brothers, one who is the leading head of the family, the eldest brother, Tenka and is seen by his brother as a samurai, despite the fact that all he uses as a weapon is a fan. He is the rolemodel of the three since he raised them and he can defeat any enemy. Literally. This guy just pulls a fan out of his ass and hits people and they lose. The second brother is a guy that wields the family sword, the family sword being a scabbard within another scabbard. Because that&#039;s a sword apparently. He looks up to his brother and he looks for his approval, so he starts rebelling because his brother doesn&#039;t respect him enough. It&#039;s like daddy issues, but your father is dead. I&#039;ll call it not daddy issues from now on. I&#039;ll talk about that later because that&#039;s the only thing of any substance within the story. And the third and smallest brother who... says sir at the end of every sentence. That&#039;s his character trait and only role in the story at this point.<br />
<br />
So the only relevant portion of the story that is worth describing is Soramaru&#039;s not daddy issues, as he is the only character that actually moves the story forward and has been defined as a person. He&#039;s a teenager that was orphaned, had his family killed in front of him and then he got almost strangled by the killer. Due to the weight of this trauma he doesn&#039;t remember those events and if someone touches his neck, he panics. He is also constantly looking towards proving himself to his family, as a competent person, who is understandably overprotective due to what happened to them. This leads him to do stupid things against what his big brother told him not to do, because he doesn&#039;t rely on him. He is the most complete character out of all of them, and while I think his execution is a bit like any other characters that bear similarities to this archetype, I do think the character is portrayed well. I just wish the plot devices behind his motivations were done better, rather than them stemming from poor communication with his brother, which is definitely his brother&#039;s fault, but his not daddy issues could&#039;ve been solved easily. For instance, there is a point where Tenka chooses to go alone rather than take his brothers on a mission when they want to, because they would slow him down. He tells them just that, and this triggers Soramaru to go on his own and try catch the criminals he went after. If Tenka would&#039;ve simply just conducted himself in a slightly different matter, like saying there is too many and it might be too dangerous for them, rather than straight up saying they&#039;re useless. Afterwards, when he sees that his brother kept rebelling twice, he proceeds to make fun of him, and imply that he pretty much is a little kid that just wants to be spoiled by his big brother, this launching another chain of events that makes Soramaru want to prove himself. These aren&#039;t necesarily things that make the writing bad, but this is something that I don&#039;t enjoy, because of how easily these problems could be solved by seeking a compromise. So this is more of a matter of personal preference rather than anything else. I simply can&#039;t enjoy drama when the sole cause of the problems is bad communication between the parties. In addition to that, I also dislike how Soramaru is written. Soramaru is written in a way that he somehow reacts the opposite way people would expect him to everytime. Stay here and keep a low profile. No. Always come for me for help when you&#039;re in trouble. No. Don&#039;t concern yourself with my business. No. He is constantly a contrarian and is too driven forward by what other people than himself say. He lacks individuality.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s something I dislike about every other character too. They don&#039;t really have motivations as much as they have character relationships. Every character is driven by someone, or something that has had happened to someone other than themselves. In other words, they have no concern for themselves, and merely react to what other characters are doing, which is something I don&#039;t personally enjoy. I enjoy seeing personal growth from other characters, which I heard is a theme shoujo anime delve into, but I enjoy personal growth because of how the characters adapt to the world around them, rather than just the people. And frankly, none of the characters really display that level of individuality, where they would think about their own future, but rather think about everyone other than themselves. The smallest brother just follows his brothers&#039; footsteps, the second brother merely reacts to his not daddy issues each chance he gets because his driving force is his family and Tenka is motivated to be protective of his brothers. None of the characters have any competent portrayal beyond their relationships, with their motivations merely being I know some people that died or I have family/friends. People are more complicated than the people they know.<br />
<br />
The series doesn&#039;t really hold any appeal with me. The animation and sound seemed mediocre to me. I mean, it tries to appeal to the female demographic by showing slender pretty boys with a well drawn male physique, while having some montages of a guy training with his sweat glistening in the air. It&#039;s not what I&#039;m into. The historical setting is pointless and not used to portray the mental state of the people, which is something I expected and wanted, and is the wrong expectation to have. I expected at least something minimal and I got nothing, since every character is too concerned about other people to think about something that would define them as individuals. The story is not incompetent, but I didn&#039;t enjoy the character portrayal and simply wasn&#039;t interested in where they are going to go, since the story doesn&#039;t really have a theme that it tries to execute, and merely has people going in conflict without having proper motivations explained. I appreciate the fact that I could understand who was important was to the characters, but I&#039;d rather also know what is important to them. If you&#039;re gonna pursue this series, do it to watch a series about three brothers that grew up orphaned and have the job of catching criminals and transporting them to prison. Do it because you&#039;re interested in their relationship dynamic. This will help you going into it. Do not expect strong action. It has to be dulled due to the target demographic, and it mostly boils down to people looking dominant in said action scenes. Don&#039;t expect much from the historical setting, since it doesn&#039;t have any relevance to the intriguing history of said times. Instead seek a drama, because that&#039;s what this series is. And it&#039;s one that I don&#039;t particularly enjoy because the people in it don&#039;t really have personal goals. But as long as you don&#039;t mind the characters being driven by their relationships, it can be competent enough. I don&#039;t see any flaws in how the characters think about each other, but I personally simply need the characters to seek something they want to do,  for themselves.

    ******contains minor spoilers******<br />
<br />
-UNDERRATED <br />
-AWESOME PLOT TWIST <br />
<br />
I KNOW what ur thinking . You must be thinking this anime is quite horrible(despite you&#039;ve not watched it) . As the rating and first few review&#039;s score ain&#039;t good. BUT watch it! Luckily i did not trust the ratings and score of the anime and  reviews . If i do so, i missed out on one good anime . <br />
<br />
Plot: 8/10<br />
The plot is about during the Meiji Era there&#039;s a giant evil snake that exist to destroy lands and cause problems and it comes every thousand year and no one knows what is it whether a spirit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182263">
        or natual disaster .And the snake need to process or rather choose a person to be the host and it is chosen randomly. And so to prevent this there&#039;s 3 brothers who is the &quot;Yamainu Squad&quot; . They are gonna kill the person who is chosen for being the snake&#039;s host before it transform into the snake. Due to the era changing there are a lot of crimes and criminals. To prevent this we have the &quot;Donten brothers&quot; who are from the shrines . And the Donten brothers are responsible to bring those criminal to a prison by ship (a small one)<br />
<br />
Character:8/10<br />
As mentioned there are  3 brothers. Firstly, Kumou, Tenka, who is currently the head of the Donten . He&#039;s cheerful and very skilled and quite handsome for me! Secondly, Kumou, Soramaru, who always look up to Tenka duh he is not very skilled LOL . Thirdly, Kumou, Chuutarou, the smallest in Donten family . He is very spoilt by the brothers since he is the youngest and the fact that their parents died when he&#039;s still a baby. The bond between the Donten is strong . Then there&#039;s a group of people who wishes for the snake to be revived instead of killing it. They think the snake as a god... Then we also have Yamainu Squad which consist of quite a few member .They are the government&#039;s dog and is used to find the vessel of the snake and kill it before it&#039;s revival . <br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 8/10 <br />
I LOVE IT. I love then tension and twist in this anime alot . As during the first 3-5 episode they gave us a feeling of heartwarming brother relationship about their daily lives . THEN something happened and everything changed.... When the snake has a vessel everyone is in panic and they work together to kill the snake despite all the challenges faced . I like the way the plot twists . Thinking of it now, it is incredible . Seriously , you should just watch it like i do. <br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
There&#039;s nothing much for me to say it&#039;s just pretty good. Quality is good and are detailed . <br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
Sound is alright for me... Firstly , I always skip the OPs and EDs . So even if you ask me what is the songs like i&#039;ll reply: &quot; I&#039;ve forgotten&quot;. But well, you can just go listen to it lol. Secondly , I was TOO focused on the anime instead of the sound.... So i&#039;ve really forgotten how&#039;s the bgm is ..... <br />
<br />
Overall:8/10<br />
This anime is really underrated to me , a fussy otaku . Watch it ! It will keep putting you in tension during a certain point (cant spoil too much ) and watch how the plot keep twisting hahaha . <br />
<br />

    Not many animes can give me a suitable plot twist/twists because i&#039;m the reigning champion of predicting what&#039;s going to happen and I&#039;m usually right. With that, that&#039;s why I was so fucking amazed by this anime because it caught me by surprise a few times. <br />
This anime has it all, laughs that make you want to rewind and rewatch that moment a couple of  times, and that perfect blend of bitter sweet while even throwing in some pretty good lessons.<br />
When I finished the anime I couldn&#039;t help but smile, so don&#039;t miss out on this because it&#039;s worth giving it a try.<br />
And keep

    Don’t be put out by the first few episodes. They probably weren’t what you were expecting. I nearly dropped this anime, however, don’t lose faith and be patient. By the time you get to episode 6, the story will take you on an emotional rollercoaster, trust me. The story is literally like a rollercoaster. The start is always boring as it is slowly ascending but as soon as it gets to the top, that’s when everything starts. The plot gets deeper, the characters are clarified, and the story is explained. This story is a mix of old and new. There are ninjas/samurais and there are

        police brigades. There’s also magic and demons. Just wait until the plot twist at the end of episode 10. XD

    Great anime, I really enjoyed it the artwork was awesome as well as the story. I enjoyed all the charecters also I&#039;ll give it an 8 out 10<br />
<br />
The reason II don&#039;t give it a 10 is because it was way too short. The length of the anime didn&#039;t allow the sorry of the characters to develop properly. For example Shirasu&#039;s brother was made out to be this powerful guy and they did nothing with him. Also the orochi battle was very short. I could go on but I liked the anime despite these problems.<br />
<br />
Overall very good I&#039;ll watch this again

    Donten Ni Warau (Laughing Under The Clouds) Review <br />
<br />
<br />
Donten ni Warau, or Laughing Under the Clouds for short, is an anime centered around three brothers in the Meiji Era. We have eldest brother, Tenka, the second brother, Soramaru, and the youngest, Chuutaro. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a story focused on the supernatural and historical elements centering around these three brothers. Despite being underrated for many reasons, the anime still has its quirks that appeal those who have watched the anime to the end.<br />
<br />
Story - 5/10<br />
While the main plot of this story centers around Tenka and the others, we get a glimpse of the cloudy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208463">
        skies of Japan in the Meiji Era. The law to abolish swords caused samurai to diminish, leaving ronin of age to rebel against the government. Meanwhile, the Kumoh brothers are set out to ferry criminals to the hell known as Gokumonju, which is centered in the middle of Lake Biwa. However, the audience is set out to believe that something&#039;s fishy brewing not only inside of Gokumonju, but the three brothers themselves. <br />
<br />
The story seems rather bland and it didn&#039;t seem to catch my attention when I first seen the summary of the plot myself. It seemed like those usual cheesy stories about some amateurs trying to stop the big bad from ruling the world. However, once I watched through this anime in one sitting I realized how well-executed this anime was. The first half of the anime was executed with a bit of comedic flair and centered around the characters. The second half, on the other hand, was juiced with plot twists, drama, and action. I have to honest that I hadn&#039;t expected for this show to drive down in a more dark-toned pace.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation - 7/10<br />
The designs of the characters are visually appealing, and I was able to tell who is who without much problem. The backgrounds were well designed, but the fight scenes during the first half of the show were quite iffy in my opinion. The second half of the show were well-animated, and nonetheless the show itself was visually appealing with its art style and animation. However, some scenes throughout the show were transitioned poorly, making me stop to think about what happened before. Other times the scenes just switch from one to another which confuses me on what&#039;s happening. <br />
<br />
Sound - 6/10<br />
The openings and endings might not seem appealing in terms of music and animation, but the soundtrack itself had its time that makes me lend an ear and stop to just listen to the music itself. I myself listened through the entire soundtrack, and I must say some particular tunes sounded majestic and well-put. Most soundtrack had an oriental tune to it, but some had a mixture of rock and what I&#039;d call &quot;generic mainstream happy anime&quot; music. However, most OST were appealing to me and fitted well with the anime.<br />
<br />
Characters - 6/10<br />
The characters were unique and each had their own faults and traits, but I felt they could&#039;ve been given more backstory and development during the entire show. Tenka was the show&#039;s favorite big brother and lead of the show. At first glance we can see that he is a humorous and caring big brother, trying to solve problems by himself. This is both a fault and a quirk on his side as the show goes on, as he does keep his brothers and his own people protected, but because of this he isn&#039;t able to share his own feelings towards anyone. Soramaru, on the other hand, is more serious and hardworking than Tenka. He does all the housework and is usually the one who tends to keep Tenka in check (other than Shirasu), but he has a problem that carries on in the anime. He wishes to become stronger and surpass Tenka, whom he feels that&#039;s treating him like his responsibility. When the show goes on we were able to see Soramaru grow up into an honest and strong-willed man, and that&#039;s something I&#039;m proud of. The younger brother, Chuutaro, isn&#039;t much developed in the anime as Soramaru and Tenka was. All we know from him since the beginning was that he&#039;s naive, innocent, but devoted to Tenka and Soramaru. He may be annoying to some people, but he is an important character in the entire anime. <br />
<br />
The other characters as well tends to get their own backstory and unique personality, earning me the possibility to be able to connect with them instead of wishing for their moment to pass by. Shiarsu, Botan, Hirari, and even the lesser important people themselves earn a chance in the spotlight. This is something I highly enjoy from this show.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think this show was amazing in its ways, but at times it felt lackluster and rocky. Sometimes the transitions from one scene to another didn&#039;t make sense and the story itself had its plot holes. It had a slow start, but during the half of the series the pace quickens. Some particular scenes felt forced and quickened. However, as a twelve episode only anime I have to say it&#039;s one of the better anime. In my opinion I myself enjoyed the show with its execution and comedy, but at times I wished for the show to just hurry up. Some scenes drag on for long, but overall I enjoy the show.

    I think this is a decent anime - despite receiving some not-as-high ratings by previous viewers. The art is really really good for sure, so you wont be disappointed on that front.<br />
<br />
The plot is not bad - I dont know about other viewers, but I could predict the major plot twist much in advance. You will really feel the bromance when you watch this, but it&#039;s not shounen-ai or yaoi or anything close. Just nice, brotherly/family love. <br />
<br />
You&#039;ll probably appreciate the MC&#039;s personality. As the middle sibling, he has some inferiority complex towards his talented older brother, and he wants to get stronger so his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180497">
        brothers can rely on him. <br />
<br />
Anyways, it&#039;s worth watching. I smiled at the end, and felt like it was a good use of my time.

    This thing is boring and nothing special.  The story doesn&#039;t pick up until episode three and gets a little exciting until episode 8.  For a twelve episode show that is bad.  This anime uses cheap tactics in order to get an emotion respond from it&#039;s viewers.  This anime feels like a bunch of amateurs wrote and directed this.  I can&#039;t hate on it too much on the story, I always felt if you have a weak story put some romance in it and they put two of them.  The romance is clumsily one romance is very rush the other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324146">
        does it better but it goes no where.  <br />
<br />
The characters is where i think why people overrated this anime.  The brothers goes thou hardship throughout the show or do they?<br />
<br />
Having a twist does not make good anime mediocre is a honest score for this anime.

    I don&#039;t want to give a lengthy review for this,because my main goal is to just notice the main strength,weakness, and my opinion on each. <br />
<br />
Story: The story is ok. I would not say it&#039;s a typical type story. Storyline is taking place in the past, probably during the wartime(it&#039;s completely fiction). It involves action so I would not say it&#039;s entirely unique, but I think they could&#039;ve developed it a little bit more. It was going toward a good story if they did not rush too much.<br />
<br />
Sound: The soundtrack is not anything out of ordinary.For some action scenes it tries to add dramatic sense

          <span style="display: none;" id="review216525">
        to it, mostly ninja or samurai type. But the story overpowers the soundtrack, so sometimes it&#039;s even hard to notice the background music.<br />
<br />
Character: I want to refrain from spoilers, but this is more like a story of 3 brothers of a wellknown family. The character developement were kind of...too common. It&#039;s like those type of characters who are always lying on the ground saying &quot;I&#039;m weak;I should just die off,&quot; and then suddenly turning point appears and they are like &quot;I want to be stronger and protect everyone.&quot; This is too common in most action/drama-genre animes.<br />
<br />
In conclusion,it was an OK anime.It&#039;s too dramatic for me and in some places(Spoiler: by the end) it turns into knot which reminds me of Naruto story a lot.Basically, I would say this story is like a mini version of Naruto plot,like 1/60th of Naruto plot. I actually quit this anime after watching first 4 epi,but I recently went back and finished it. Not a great anime, but it&#039;s those type of anime to watch when you are bored or can&#039;t decide on anything to watch.<br />

    DONTEN NI WARAU ANIME REVIEW<br />
OVERALL: 8.6<br />
PLOT: 8/10<br />
This anime is unexpectedly great for a 12 episode one. Since I hardly see post and pictures of this series, I thought that is was just fine. However, upon watching it, the excitement I&#039;ve felt is enough to complete it with just one sitting. This anime focuses on the three brothers and a known monster who will endangered their lives, must we say human lives, every 300 years. I&#039;m truly moved on the bond of these three brothers. Honestly, I&#039;ve cried, a lot, while watching this one. It&#039;s rare to see an anime showing this kind of compassionate love

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269075">
        to his family. And this successfully showed it. For me, the plot is twisted just perfectly fine, you will expect but don&#039;t expect. However, the one you expect happens. Something like that if you know what I mean. The story will keep you from thinking that something will happen and will also keep you from thinking that nothing will happen. It&#039;s just so crazy.<br />
CHARACTERS: 9/10<br />
I really love the characters of this series, yes. They flawlessly showed the greatest of a family&#039;s love. They show the sacrifices someone can take just for the sake of their loved ones and for me, it is too emotional, it is too heartbreaking. I love it how the characters grow and decide for the benefits of others. How they accept and keep themselves stronger because they needed to be. The anime portrays different kind of traits a person may have and can do. Sadness, positiveness, betrayal, loyalty, principle in life, love. For me, the emotions on this series is just too overflowing that I enjoyed and love this one.<br />
SOUND: 9/10<br />
The voices of the characters are great. In my opinion, they&#039;ve successfully express what the situation wanted to express that time. What the characters wanted us to feel and the like. There are also voices which gives me chill. With regards to the opening and ending songs, well, I do &#039;t have a comment in there. Both are good and enjoying to listen to.<br />
ENJOYMENT: 10/10<br />
I love this series. I really love this anime. Well, isn&#039;t it obvious? I&#039;ve started watching this at around 1:00pm and I&#039;ve finished it like 8:00pm? What I can assure is that I don&#039;t take a rest while watching it. This anime just keeps me going. Even if my eyes are already kinda swelling since I&#039;ve cried a lot in the middle part of this one.<br />
ENDING: 7/10<br />
The ending is cliche for me. I guess, it is a norm on this kind of genre in an anime. That they&#039;ve exhausted every solution possible to resolve the problem, to kill the enemy. Then, the only solution for it is too simple, to easy. That, I expected. And I have no problem with that. The anime satisfy my eyes enough that something like this won&#039;t matter greatly that it will affect my whole experience with it bigtime.

    Laughing under the clouds, if I had to put this show in one word... well TBH, I can&#039;t. I&#039;d rather put it in one sentence, Moving on with a Positive Outlook on Life. <br />
<br />
The series starts off with a really Shoujo story, keeping us in the dark about it&#039;s world... and while moving further in the story, unravels bits of what the plot is, while being chained to the past. I say &#039;chained to the past&#039; because of the constant flashbacks and how it delves into a characters past, it&#039;s mostly a negative point for other series, but IMO this one somewhat takes that to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389046">
        its advantages and reveals more about the story through them.<br />
<br />
If I had to say the weakest point of the series, it would be the dialogue heaviness, I don&#039;t really mind it but some episodes are just way too dialogue heavy to go unnoticed. The story really doesn&#039;t need as much as they make it out to be.<br />
<br />
The characters are really well done, I found the villains and the heroes to be quite entertaining. Maybe added a little too many characters but hardly found any character to be unlikeable or really forgettable, from the main cast at least. I&#039;m gonna give it an 8 for that part.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack is decent, I hardly found anything out of place, but most of it didn&#039;t click me either. The OP was alright, I don&#039;t think I skipped it anytime (mostly because of the visuals), though I&#039;d say the ED was definitely better, GALNERYUS really did come through on this one. Giving the OST a 7.<br />
<br />
The animation isn&#039;t the best, but it did come through when needed. They didn&#039;t use CGI, so I&#039;ll give them that in the very least. The artstyle was very eye catching, the historic feel was captured very well. Gonna pump that one up for a good 9.<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;d say I liked the story a lot, the twists were well planned and came off very well, IMO the middle 7-8 episodes of the story were the best, they really did something with the potential the series had. The emotional part was very well done, and the characters could be resonated with a lot. I&#039;m really glad I decided to check on this before going onto another one from my PTW list. It was a real change, honestly.<br />
<br />
Final rating: 9<br />
<br />
A SHOUJO THROUGH AND THROUGH.

    If you like nicely ended stories with much action and plot twisting you&#039;ll like this anime. <br />
<br />
I had lots of mixed feelings of this anime. Ok first I love Tenka he is the absolutely best character ever, but the reason for my mixed feelings were they were constantly using him as an excuse. Like to get stronger, the reason for this the reason for that, like NO don&#039;t do that to MY Tenka!!<br />
(please excuse my language)<br />
<br />
Story- Ahhhh again it&#039;s like they used Tenka as an excuse too much. This is a giant jumbled animated version of producers continuously bitch slapping the audience. Like it seems

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215547">
        calm but then shit gets real and it&#039;s like noooo wait what? noooooo wait what?! that kind of feeling the whole way through. While I was watching it I was like I&#039;m so giving this a 1 how dare they but then after it was like ehhh not that bad.<br />
<br />
Art- It was pretty good. 2014 so it&#039;s relatively recent.<br />
<br />
Sound- Nice soundtracks, and love the seiyuus (voice actors) they did a good job. Again I love Tenka to death.<br />
<br />
Character- Might I profess my love again? I LOVE YOU TENKAAAAAAA!!!!! He is the best character ever. There are a few weaklings in the mixture of kick ass characters but in comes character development and they get stronger and somehow a relatively minor more like major supporting character turned into a kinda important character. I didn&#039;t really get why they did it.... You see many sides to all of the characters and you really get to know them well they did a really good job with that. <br />
<br />
Overall- It was nice but so many plot twists it was kind of annoying. It&#039;s like Fushigi Yugi if you&#039;ve watched it. It&#039;s constant get together and break up for the main couple that a side couple with max 3 minute screen time is better than them. That&#039;s what this reminded me of they kept going back and forth with one particular thing that I cannot say because it would be a spoiler. There was a light romance between some and I have to say it was super cute. So basically kinda annoying story, decent art, meh sound, (TENKAAAA) great characters, and it ties up really nicely in a present box for you. I&#039;m sorry for my obsession over Tenka but he&#039;s just so cute and cool, just a giant precious cinnamon roll. <br />
That&#039;s all thanks for reading ^~^<br />
