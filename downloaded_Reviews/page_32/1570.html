    Major is one of my favorite anime franchises of all time, let alone my favorite sports anime franchise by quite some distance. It’s characterization, intense matches and long-running storytelling present in many seasons with consistency always captivated me in so many ways. With its successor, Major 2nd having a very impressive first season (especially for being the sequel to a long-running success story already and not disappointing like a Boruto compared to Naruto), I was quite excited for this new season of Major to drop back in April. Here are some of my thoughts on the 8th overall season of the Major franchise and the

        2nd season of Major 2nd by Takuya Mitsuda!<br />
<br />
Story/Writing (9/10)<br />
<br />
Major 2nd season 2 takes place a couple of years after the first season where Daigo Shigeno is now in Junior High, where he turns out to be the captain of the Fuurin baseball team. A team that is mostly full of girls (which also has his crime partner, Mutsuko Sakura from the Dolphins days) since a lot of the fellow guys on the team got kicked out due to a shoplifting incident, leaving Daigo alone with one guy (later two), to join the girls to form a baseball team with the thinnest roster imaginable. Hell, there isn’t even a proper coach in this team so, despite Fuurin’s previous reputation of being a competitive team, the lack of personnel automatically put Daigo in a tricky situation.<br />
<br />
Compared to the second season of the original Major where it had Goro conquering so many physical obstacles like returning from a potentially career-ending shoulder injury and switching to being a southpaw pitcher, to joining rival school Kaido along with Toshiya and go through multiple trials to get a taste of the immense competition awaiting his baseball future, this season feels a lot more tamer than that but presents its own challenges that Daigo and Fuurin have to go through. This occasion, mainly as a team that is all over the place – some players have talent but no real desire to get down and succeed through it all, some players have a lack of talent completely, some players have talent but are too rough and inexperienced to conquer against competition that is much highly skilled and have much more depth too than all of them, the fact that most of the team are comprised of females which a lot of teams tend to look down on, etc. This is a season that surrounds itself through teamwork as a whole, and working together to grow as a cohesive unit and try to pose a challenge to opposing teams despite the handicaps and hardships that they have had to endure as a team altogether. They may not have a coach or a proper bench (hell, some starters are barely classified as rookies despite some others playing baseball in the past in Little League), but through Daigo’s development as a leader, they still fight on; even with an obvious glass ceiling that hangs above them given how the state of the team is.<br />
<br />
The story itself for me is really entertaining for the most part as with a refreshing take on a cast and a more long-term focus on the Junior High section of Major 2nd which will extend past this season, it showcases the more gradual build that this show is laying the foundation of with this edition. The next season is where a lot of the big-time matches will kick off so this season focuses more on the development to get to that place and to build some tension for Daigo and potential rivals too for the future. For the most part, I feel like everything’s done well and organically too. There are points in the story where the pacing feels rushed, like at the end of certain matches and an oddly placed timeskip, but despite those flaws, I found the development of the cast and most of the matches itself to be extremely well crafted and drawn out for the entire season. Compared to a lot of anime this year which lost my interest narratively really quickly, Major 2nd offers some of the best character writing I’ve seen this year as well as in the franchise itself. It may not have the epic matches in season 5 or the great emotional punches in season 1 but the focus on teamwork with an evenly matched cast that doesn’t rely itself on Goro Shigeno makes it one of the most enjoyable and lovable seasons to date.<br />
<br />
Characters (10/10)<br />
<br />
The Furin Junior High Baseball team consisted of a mix of female and male baseball players (mostly females). So already, the cast, in general, feels very different from the traditional cast you would find in any sports anime let alone a Major season. Here, this anime showcases one of the rare times where both genders play important roles to work together as a team so that whole dynamic is pretty interesting and refreshing for the most part, and I’m glad Takuya Mitsuda chose to go with this direction, especially since for High School onwards, he can only mainly focus on Daigo and males due to the Koshien not allowing guy-girl teams to participate together unlike with Junior High.<br />
<br />
Daigo himself I felt was a really good protagonist again like the previous season but takes on a much more different role than the traditional sports protagonist. Daigo isn’t as hotheaded and charismatic as Goro in the original edition of Major, but with a more confident, serious, and determined personality at hand, Daigo came across as a genuine leader in this one. A leader who would work as hard as he could to bring the best out of his teammates to make up for the many obstacles that they have to overcome being a team that had no coach and barely a cohesive squad due to a lot of the older players being kicked out for shoplifting. He’s showcased some nice development from the first season and played a really good role in being the quiet but tactical and observational captain who also had the passion and heart for baseball to motivate his teammates to try and succeed alongside him.<br />
<br />
Another character that returned was Mutsuko Sakura into having a more prominent role this season as probably the 2nd main character instead of Hikaru last season. While her personality hasn’t changed much, her passion for baseball has grown immensely and she’s become a pitcher now compared to being a slogger previously. Given the lack of teammates in Fuurin, she took the responsibility for becoming a pitcher and the show did a good job with her development to be a competent pitcher than can compete with a lot of teams in tournaments (still not the best of the best ones though). Plus, she was also the support that the team needed at times given strained times as she could relate to her teammates but also to Daigo too if he was under pressure or was putting too much work down to improve everyone else. Plus she’s still charming, sweet, and likable too so those are all bonuses to how good she is.<br />
<br />
Then you have the rest of the team who mostly are enjoyable to watch and a really good supporting cast as a whole to the anime with a few standouts being Yayoi Sawa, one of my favorite characters of the year for just her calm, cool and collected personality as well as Chisato Fuji for being really sweet, charming and quite the devilish little troll at times when teasing others, especially her sister Chiyo. Some characters like Tanba didn’t quite receive much spotlight as well as Kandori but for the most part, the baseball club all shined together due to how much this season focused on teamwork and how each player is important to the success of the team, especially since none of them aren’t as talented, fiery and motivational to win like a Goro Shigeno.<br />
<br />
The rival teams also had a nice mix of new characters, old characters returning from Little League (Andy, Urabe, Michiru) and old characters returning from the original Major edition (Goro, Fuji) to all have their good moments too whether in playing baseball against Fuurin or just by being a small part of the Fuurin journey to grow and develop like with Goro.<br />
<br />
So overall, I really loved the characters as a whole and this club as a whole might be one of my favorite sports clubs I’ve seen in anime based on the teams. Teamwork made the cast grow nicely together, especially chemistry wise and it really shows here.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation (8.5/10)<br />
<br />
Major 2nd season 2’s art for the most part looks really different not only from previous Major seasons but from sports anime in general. It has more of this slice of life-like feel to it less than the typical sports anime but for the most part, I loved this refreshing change.<br />
<br />
While the episodes down the line do look a tad weaker than how it started (mainly due to the number of delays this show suffered due to COVID-19), the show looked damn good. It was colorful, the character designs were great, the animation for the baseball matches was better than ever – especially seeing the pitches feel more realistic and varied and just seeing the runners slide and batters swing look more satisfying and real as ever. The colors also pop really nicely too overall in this show as well. For a baseball anime, while it may not have the intense Haikyuu or Hajime no Ippo like moments in terms of animation, this edition of Major leaned more towards the calm, realistic style, which looked amazing. OLM brought the best out of this anime and even with having to deal with COVID-19 delays, they did such a stellar job overall with bringing this anime to life with how fantastic it looks overall.<br />
<br />
Some of the visuals for the openings looked fantastic too, especially the colorful nature of the 2nd opening with the paint flying everywhere while showing all characters there.<br />
<br />
Sound (9/10)<br />
<br />
The sound department was strong here, as usual for a Major anime. The background music has a nice variety of calm tracks, funny tracks for comedy moments, and intense tracks when getting down to the clutch moments in a baseball game. Major’s always been strong for me when it comes to music and how it fits a variety of moments, and this season is no different whatsoever.<br />
<br />
The opening songs were really catchy for me as well since I never wanted to skip it at all due to how fun it sounded, especially the first one ‘Answer’. The songs again, not the traditional sports opening songs as it felt more like a josei/slice of life song but for the atmosphere of the show, it works nicely.<br />
<br />
The voice acting also was great, with some standouts being Kana Hanazawa as Mutsuko and Sumire Uesaka portraying the perfect cute devil in Chisato. For the most part, all the voice actors/actresses fit their roles really well for the entirety of the show and delivered nicely in the range of emotions that the show provided overall.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10)<br />
<br />
In a year where I’ve been disappointed by so many shows and dislike so many shows, Major 2nd season 2 has been a genuine breath of fresh air. It’s not only a refreshing show since it’s actually great but also gives a refreshing feel to the Major franchise and the sports genre as a whole. And given how this Junior High arc is not over yet with this season, it feels like one of the most important Major arcs to date which makes it more exciting. The matches and characters were just really great overall, and I had a blast watching this anime when I desperately needed something decent from this year.<br />
<br />
The journey for the airing of this 2nd season was a damn bumpy one, to say the least as it got hit with numerous delays in the earlier half of the season, where episodes would not air for more than a month to make up for production scheduling to ensure that the season can finish somehow. But in the end, it managed to actually finish and I’m glad since unlike Kingdom season 3, I get to actually complete a clear anime of the year candidate this year itself.<br />
<br />
Major 2nd season 2 was an excellent anime and an excellent addition to the Major franchise despite feeling a lot different from the other 7 seasons overall (Major + first season of Major 2nd). Definitely recommend the whole Major franchise as a whole, let alone just this one anyway but for Major fans, this anime should be a treat just like the rest.<br />
<br />
Score 9.3/10

    One of the things Major2nd did, is not being the original Major, instead concentrating on hot head skilled baseball player Goro, it is focusing on his son Daigo who unlike his father doesn’t have a lot of skills in the destined sport, and though S1 already gone with it, S2 is still with it, Daigo is still not the shiny player in his middle school team, though to be the captain, the focus in this season is not at his relationship with his childhood friend Satou Hikaru that the first season concentrate on building up In the first season, the 2nd season concentrate on something

          <span style="display: none;" id="review360527">
        Major haven’t done until now - character development.<br />
<br />
It’s not to say that the rest of Major seasons doesn’t have them, but in most of the season the focus was on Goro and his playing, the rest of his team gets less attention, and sometimes, only chosen from there elected to be developed, in Major2nd S2 the focus is only, but only, at every member of the Fuurin team, it concentrate so much on each of the members that even the usual rival team characters don’t get the usual attention, even Daigo who supposed to be main character, feels like any other members on the team.<br />
<br />
Story - 8<br />
<br />
Those who watched already S1 of Major2nd, know already the story not going the same old way of the Goro’s Major series, but going in little different way, as we said, Daigo is not the best baseball player, and though he improved his catcher skills, he doesn’t care to let others takes that spot, and so we get a story of Daigo being important character as a captain of the team, as he needs to raise it to win the tournament.<br />
<br />
One of the first things to see at the start of the season is there’s a kinda of time skip between the seasons, at first I thought - what happened between them, and how actually Daigo made to be the captain, but the anime actually fills it later, but that’s not the important stuff - by time skipping without filling the anime actually shows us it doesn’t matter, not yet - there’s more important stuff that we should notice and know, and that’s how the season start like S3 of Major - there’s no enough players, and Daigo needs to gather more few players so his team could enter the tournament.<br />
<br />
In fact, I found that this season comprised to S3 of Major, where Goro takes school without baseball team, and though he manage to build one, it’s a weak one, and Goro needs to raise it to succeed, though there’s a lot of similarities because Daigo does need to train his teammates to win the league, Fuurin team is not that bad once players are gathered, it’s actually team that have a variety of players, each with his own skills, and unlikely in S3 of Major where Goro hold the whole team, Daigo only leading them to do their best.<br />
<br />
So if the base of the season is not Daigo raising weak team, what makes the S2 ticking? As I said earlier, it’s the characters here, because as for the story, it’s like every other sport school club anime, and like every such an anime making sportively and competitive, S2 succeed in it’s character development, and to add more to the picture, most of the team is actually girls, which actually make the anime in more style of women sport anime, but still can get of it’s own in term of story like Major can do.<br />
<br />
And that’s what make the story of S2 more appealing, not only on succeeding and be the best but also concentrating more on:<br />
<br />
Characters - 9<br />
<br />
We will start with Daigo, which gets the main focus on the series, not because he’s the much important, in fact, as said, Daigo gets the same treatment as the other team players, the reason however he’s the main focus, is because he’s the captain, and there’s not a match that the team doesn’t need the captain to lead them, I think that is actually his treatment due the rules in this seasons to develop any character on the team, and because Daigo still haven’t found yet his destined position on the pitch, he gets to stand out only as the captain, to let other characters evolve.<br />
<br />
Sakura for example, gets much more upgrade in her role, if In S1 she got kinda the main supporting character, here her effective is much crucial, she’s not only member on the team, but also gets important position, and also as we saw in the first season, have some kind of one side crush on Daigo, that gets little development in the season.<br />
<br />
What I meant earlier saying that the character development in S2 is much more than usual, it’s mainly because in the other seasons of Major the other characters gets little of them, but in this season, each new character gets his own stage in each game - Nishina, Chisato, Sagara, Sawa, Kabashima and those not all the team, and each and very one of them gets their screen time to develop, and that’s what really ticks the season, there’s a lot of sport, and like S1 there’s a lot of explanations and training, but those not for the sake of the sport, but for the sake of each character development.<br />
<br />
Animation - 7<br />
<br />
One of the things about the animation of S2 is that I believe have 2 sides - good, and bad.<br />
<br />
The good is - it’s much more cleaner, much more realistic and refreshing than the animation of the rest of the seasons, the colours and the lines are well drawn, there’ll be those who will criticise the character design to be little different, but I actually think it didn’t changed that at all, but because the new animation style it looks different.<br />
<br />
The bad side, is not that bad actually, but more of a hunch, the new style let the anime feel of slice of life, though the anime doesn’t lack it it also doesn’t have the general feeling of Major, and though that in good quality it’s sharp and all, OLM kinda let the anime feel like their other series - childish feeling, it’s not ruining at all, but it’s also not letting me feel the old Major feel, and though the season doesn’t try to be Major style but have it own style, it let the feeling that it’s less sport anime.<br />
<br />
Music - 8<br />
<br />
The OST of Major is highly improved, and adds a lot of intensity to the games.<br />
<br />
The 1st opening is easily one of my favourite and make good impression, and the 1st ending and 2nd ending as well, and though the 2nd opening is very good, It lost a little the originality of the 1st.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall - 9/8<br />
<br />
Major2nd S2 truly takes kind high risk in doing some things the other seasons haven’t done - concentrating on character development of the main team and less on the rival team, though in some important cases it does, it doesn’t forget about who the anime is, and OLM did great job directing it, though to be little weird season compared to the other seasons that their full focus is on the sport, in S2 the sport is good as the rest, the tense, the excitement and the ambition to be the best team is still there, but the theme of the season is changed, and Daigo is not Goro and only the captain, really no more than that, but it still Major and does it in great way.

    So Major 2nd has made it to its 10th episode and honestly for now its been quite the rocky watch. Last season was 25 eps and I don’t think this one will be 52 so this early review should be fine.<br />
Story: 7 If you haven’t seen the first season then just know that the 1st season was about the main character finding himself and catching up with the old characters (and their kids). This 2nd season is honestly really comparable to the 3rd season of major where its about our main character making the most out of his schools now almost non-existent baseball team with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349989">
        the caveat that this time it’s a mostly girls team. Also don’t expect super intense baseball like the original major or Diamond no Ace, the anime as a whole has a more slice of life kind of feel though it’s still is predominantly a sports anime.<br />
Art: 8 This brings us to the art which is not bad but very simple. This anime definitely makes sure to show the realities of middle school semi-casual baseball with most of the pitches and impact sounds being very mundane though I think the batting is always shown off quite nicely. I like most of the character designs, being simple but you can definitely see their personality still. Overall, not bad but nothing too exciting.<br />
Sound: 9 It’s a baseball anime through and through with the bats swinging through the air, the baseball impacting the catcher gloves and metal smacking balls to the outfield. Its nothing too spectacular though I will note I really like the OP and ED (ED being surprisingly melancholic). <br />
Character: 6 So this one is hard and probably a rating that will change but is a good one to look at in terms of this being an early review of the show. The characters on Daigo’s team are all supposed to be flawed and not very good baseball players and the anime makes sure to keep that in your mind with many of the characters making a lot of mistakes and having not great personalities. This all contrasts with Daigo’s (main char) personality which is solid and developed now while still pushing him. For now, its honestly a rough watch as seeing bad characters play bad baseball is definitely a meh feeling but I can say that at episode 10 things overall seems to be swinging up with 2 of the unlikable characters starting to get their redeeming moments.<br />
Enjoyment and Overall: 7 I honestly would recommend this anime and its first season especially if you were a fan of the original major series as it is what I would expect from a kids version of major, its sorta like Boruto in terms of new interesting characters except at least this one doesn’t outright make the old characters worse at all. It’s a slow but enjoyable watch, but just remember that this is a sports anime where the whole point is that the team is starting out rough but is showing signs of getting there. Though Daigo is there to play that steady, plucky main character keeping the team together which makes it not too bad.<br />

    After months of delayed episodes due to Covid issues, Major 2nd S2 finally came to an end and it has been a fun ride. <br />
It’s wrong to compare this series to the original Major; even though in this season there are some similarities to Major S3 the vibes I got from watching Major 2nd S2 are completely different. <br />
<br />
Story 7: The plot is pretty simple, Daigo ends up being the captain of Fuurin&#039;s baseball team, the team doesn&#039;t have a coach so Daigo has to lead the team and struggle with his teammates. The journey begins from here, the team has just enough members to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363247">
        participate in tournaments and official matches and is mainly a girl’s baseball team, they find troubles along the road and there&#039;s a little twist to spice things up in the final episodes.<br />
<br />
Characters 9: the characters are the selling point of the show, the anime focuses on every team member, each one of them gets some kind of development both in baseball and in the relationships with their teammates. Daigo is not the center of the attention every time, he is the main character but feels more like a part of a team that works together than the leader that can overcome everything by himself. In fact he is often supported by the vice-captain Mutsuko and other teammates and he relies on them. The team synergy is just that good. <br />
<br />
Visuals and sound 9: the anime is colorful and fits really well the mood of a team playing with 6 girls on the field, the new character design feels pleasant for this same reason as well. Some scenes (the batting and the pitching ones) are repeated but overall the animations are clean. <br />
The voice acting is also on point and features renowned seiyuus such as Kana Hanazawa, Sakura Ayane and Uesaka Sumire. <br />
Openings and endings are great, both openings are among my favourites in 2020, you should try to see and listen to them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9: this show is definitely a spokon but outside of the matches and training sessions it has a sweet Slice-of-Life feel to it and I loved that. Every episode had a nice pacing and flew away.  It was terrible having to wait for months to watch new episodes but the wait was worth it and the series turned out pretty well. <br />
<br />
All in all Major 2nd S2 deserves an 8 in my book, I really hope this gets a 3rd season.<br />

    Saw a lot of comments complain about this show while I was watching it, saying it wasn&#039;t good because the main character is not like his dad. Well, I really liked that aspect in the first and second seasons of this anime. He isn&#039;t his dad and if he was like his dad, then it&#039;s basically the same anime all over again right? <br />
<br />
Something I especially liked about the second season was the focus on playing in a girls&#039; team. I guess because I&#039;m a girl myself, I found that I could relate and empathize with the characters more. <br />
<br />
Anyway, good anime. Give it a

    Major continues<br />
<br />
2 years after the last season the story goes on.<br />
<br />
That being said this is probably my least favourite season out of the now 7 or so in the major series.<br />
<br />
<br />
It&#039;s by no means bad, but it feels lacking.<br />
<br />
The focus is more on the team instead of Daigo, which is fine I guess, but he felt left behind until the last 2 eps.<br />
<br />
I actually do like most of the team members a lot. They feel more memorable than the ones in the Gorou version of middle school.<br />
<br />
<br />
That being said, the season was plagued by delays, wonky animation, and just average music compared to the other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363984">
        seasons.<br />
<br />
It also ends in the middle of the arc while most other Major seasons are always arcs by themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do hope for another season, that being said I also probably wouldn&#039;t mind if we skip straight to highschool.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So to conclude, by no means a bad season, but it would leave a bad taste if this turns out to be the last ever Major season, especially cause the manga is not actively being translated.

    The second Season of Major 2nd is a solid show but the production issues due to COVID are clearly visible. This would not be a huge issue as it is how it is, but the show is lacking in the narrative. In the last years the sport manga and anime clearly had taken a huge step up in narrative exposition. Not the matches are the main focus but the training. Haikyuu shows that more than anyone else. Ace of Diamond to stay in the baseball category another good example that a good sport anime needs the training to bring the character to live. This sadly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362641">
        is not happening in Major. Most of the season is the actual matches and *spoiler alert* the drop out of the tournament is therefore really a killer in the narrative.<br />
<br />
This narrative is really jumpy and one time the matches drag out, then suddenly it jumps forward. This is really confusing.<br />
<br />
Especially sad as with the girls and boys mixed this anime is really something fresh from your Adrenalin kicking male and &quot;lets be friends&quot; girl stereotype show. It mixes welll and when they for once put the focus on that this show is really brilliant. <br />
<br />
The last episode really pushed the show higher as I would rated it at episode 19 so I have high hopes for the future.

    to much of a copy of the real major. like i already know what will happen before it happens. it was a chore to wacth it. not like the real major but then again orginal is always better then the spinoff or copy in this case. its a good watch for you that really really like this kind of anime on replay that said they still have some orginal work that makes its stand a little bit out from major its like watching an ova of a really good anime. well its my opion you have to watch it for yourself i am pretty sure
