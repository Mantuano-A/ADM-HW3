    Magic Knight Rayearth 2 is the telling of the second arc of the manga. While it differs from the manga, it is still a good story. The tone of the series becomes much darker in this season, and it deals much with the past of the pillar. We see the sorrowful role the pillar really is. <br />
This is emphasized by the three nations invading the crumbing Cephiro, each who have their own reasons for invading, but eventually, two of the three decide the better, and actually help to save Cephiro during the final battle. <br />
Besides the invading nations, there is the mysterious Nova and her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19827">
        &quot;mother&quot; Debonaire. They are, in fact the only real bad guys in the story. The characters from other nations are all likable. It&#039;s neat how they play off of different civilizations too. Even the music matches, which is very good!<br />
<br />
The series develops Hikaru more, from the naive hyper girl into a much more mature girl. She also has her first experience with love. What I dislike about this season, however, is that too much time is focused on Hikaru, leaving Umi and Fuu pretty much forgotten about. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s also nice to see the bonds that have formed between the former villains of the series. Lantis is an interesting addition, but is far too emotionless. I find a lot of CLAMP&#039;s male characters, especially the tall skinny black haired ones, to be hard to tell apart, and somewhat emotionally dead. But it&#039;s great to see Ferio back, now fulfilling his position of royal blood. And the romance between he and Fuu is shown a little more. <br />
<br />
The story is moving, i would say it is even more moving than the first season. While it is missing some of the beautiful scenery, it is made up for by the story. <br />
<br />
Besides focusing too much on Hikaru, I also did not like the mecha theme that was there. The knights spend most of their fighting time in their mashins. But the battles where they do use magic and swordplay are good. <br />
<br />
The music is amazing, especially the last opening theme. The first opening theme of the season is meant to link the two stories together, each showing scenes from the first season as well as the current. The song kind of sucks. But the last opening theme, Hikari to kage wo dakishimata, is beautiful. <br />
<br />
The end of the series is also very emotionally involved, but on a happier note than the first season.  <br />
<br />
Overall, this season is very good, and if you liked the first season, you should definitely watch this one. (as long as you avoid the dub, then again, I have never seen a good english dub, I don&#039;t even bother anymore!)<br />

    I personally felt this didn&#039;t live up to the first season. I really felt the impact of the ending of the first series. Sure it left things open, but it still felt conclusive at the same time. I thought the ending was really touching and you really feel how the three magic knights bonded with one another and you really see that. To me, making a sequel just takes away the impact the ending had on me. Personally, I thought if they were going to do a sequel, they could have just made them stay in Cefiro instead to try solve the remaining problems it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8634">
        had and would eventually come and then end it the same way the first season did. The series doesn&amp;rsquo;t really have the same unpredictable plot twists the first series had impact wise. And I just really didn&amp;rsquo;t like the newer characters. The Chizeta twins and Lady Aska just came across as annoying and I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the rest of the cast. When you have your antagonists as your comic relief and not acting serious, it just goes down the toilet. <br />
<br />
I thought the magic knights were developed enough already and they were able to use their maturity and experience, but they just simply couldn&amp;rsquo;t develop any further to some extent. To me, at that point, they just hit their peak. If they didn&amp;rsquo;t go back and have that ending where they are embracing each other and crying, then this story would have worked out better. It&amp;rsquo;s just my main beef will always be that the ending had an incredible impression on me filled with emotion and resolution But by going back, and then coming back, you truly do see their development of how much they cared about protecting Cefiro.<br />
<br />
Along with the characters, we now have a lot of new elements to the series with design. Like the Autozam people represented industrial and robotic technology. Of course with the Magic Knights have those Mashins looking like mechs, the Autozam people have their own mechs like the FTO and the GTO. Their costume designs are pretty nifty as well. It has a descent balance of being fantasy and sci fi features to it. The FTO that Eagle pilots bares a very strong resemblance to the Dunbine from Aura Battler Dunbine which I thought was pretty cool, but had more of a First Appearance Iron Man twist to it. I also like how the other antagonists from Fahren and Chizeta were more cultural looking. Fahren was based on ancient China and Chizeta was more Arabic but they spoke in Osaka dialect. To combat the Mashin&amp;rsquo;s, Lady Aska brings a drawing that resembles her servant to a gigantic form and the Chizeta twins can use humongous genies. <br />
<br />
Which leads me to the action. It is more reliant on the lets say &amp;ldquo;mech action&amp;rdquo; and we don&amp;rsquo;t see much sword play or magic. I guess that takes away from using excessive recycled footage. I really like the action, but I just really miss the approach and how it tried to distinguish itself from other magical girl anime. Now it tries to be more like a mech anime. Granted I do like the designs of the Mashins and the FTO, but giant genies and weird drawings once again comes into why I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the humor. <br />
<br />
And the miniaturization of the characters isn&amp;rsquo;t really as prevalent as it was in the previous season. <br />
<br />
Ferio now being revealed to have royal blood is now dressed up more formally, and lets say Caladina shedded some clothing. <br />
<br />
Other than that, it&amp;rsquo;s the same old CLAMP school of how they draw eyes and faces. It&amp;rsquo;s a pity thanks to the circumstances of the story, we don&amp;rsquo;t get to see much of the scenery that the first season had which brought a great imagination element to it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get past an episode of watching the English dub in the first season, so I never really bothered watching the dub for the 2nd season. But anyway, the cast still remains the same that were initially introduced in the previous series. The original cast still do their roles very well and convincingly. I still love how passionate and emotional Hikaru always comes across. Juurouta Kosugi who played Zagato is also back and this time he is playing his brother Lantis. I don&amp;rsquo;t think the role really requires his charisma or his dark voice, but character wise, it was important. <br />
<br />
Some additions to the cast are Inoue Yo and Hisakawa Aya as the Chizeta princess twins, Tatra and Tetra. Inoue Yo still has that calm voice you always hear in other roles as Belldandy from Ranma and Kasumi from Ranma. But she brings a more humorous tone with how she likes to joke around. Hisakawa Aya who has played Sailor Mercury as Chizeta is not really as recognizable as Inoue Yo. She is more darker toned and tends to sound more angry and serious. <br />
<br />
Some of the background music is still the same from the first season. Like instrumental versions of Yuzurenai Negai are still sometimes used and still plays very orchestrated music. A lot of the new background music is well cultural appropriate to some of the characters. Especially that of Tetra and Tarta who represent more of an Arabian kind of background and that kind of music is played to represent them. So I think it&amp;rsquo;s really well appropriate to the mood as usual. <br />
<br />
I can&amp;rsquo;t really get into the new opening theme, Hikari to Kage wo Dakishimete Mama. Sure it&amp;rsquo;s still sung by the same singer of the previous song, Naomi Tamura, but because I don&amp;rsquo;t like the themes of the story, the song also does a good job of telling it but doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the kind of pacing or the kind of emotion that was appealing that Yuzurenai Negai had. But on the other hand, the video clips does go pretty synch to the song. <br />
<br />
Well, in terms of story, on a conceivable sense, it was a great idea. I thought it took a very original and distinctive approach. I really miss the Japanese style RPG like characteristics it had. And as a result, there are no video games based on this particular story arc in considering the fact I do happen to still enjoy the Sega Saturn and Super Nintendo games. And with the art and animation, since the 2nd season aired a week after the first season ended and didn&amp;rsquo;t have a year break like how other anime seasons do, they really couldn&amp;rsquo;t do much to have any significant improvement in the design. But the newer characters were fresh, but not really that exciting or distinctive. The music is still alright and didn&amp;rsquo;t really change too much.

    To say this is Rayearth’s second season would be a bit misleading. Technically it started the week right after the “First Season” ended, and really the numbering doesn’t reset, so it’s less so a second Season as it is the last 29 episodes of a 49 Episode Anime that for some reason was given a different name than the first one (Though to be fair, the Manga also had the split numbering, so I guess that has something to do with it). Anyhow, did the show improve since the last Season? Let’s find out:<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
If there’s one thing I like is how the show starts off

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310581">
        by addressing the aftereffects of the previous Season’s finale. It was not a happy ending to say the least, and the girls are understandably traumatized by the ordeal. Thus their main motivation is to try and do something to try and fix the mess that they made… even though, as all the other characters point out, it wasn’t their fault.<br />
<br />
That’s also something I like. It is shown that the problems that arose in the last season wasn’t something that could be attributed to any one particular person, but rather a problem inherent to a much larger system that was the problem. In turn this Season does address that, and at multiple points the stupidity of such a system is pointed out. Hell, the morality in this show isn’t too far off from what you’d see in a Ghibli movie, with it being rather white and gray overall (Bar one small element of it that I’ll take about in a bit). In turn, the storyline has also become far more serialized. No more filler episodes here, folks, this is one long ass storyline that takes its sweet time to develop.<br />
<br />
That said, it’s not as if this show is perfect. While an improvement overall, I dare say it does some things WORSE than the previous Season. For instance, while I do appreciate their attempt to give Hikaru a character arc, the actual subplot is hideously drawn out and unnecessary, with it dominating the whole plot during its last few episodes. Also, the previously mentioned morality? Well for some reason they decided to introduce a VERY CLEAR VILLAIN, which just kinda ruins the idea, especially since apparently this subplot wasn’t in the Manga and was instead a replacement for one I find to be much more interesting (At least from what I’ve heard about it. I admittedly haven’t read Rayearth’s Manga). So yeah, while there is a lot of good here, there’s also some very notable bad stuff.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The cast is pretty good, but yet again our main trio is the weak link. Hikaru is better than before, namely as a result of the previously mentioned subplot, but overall she’s still kinda generic to me. Umi is still my favorite overall and this Season does give her what’s quite possibly her absolute best moment, while Fuu… is Fuu, so I don’t really care about her.<br />
<br />
The sidecast yet again comes in to save the day. A bunch of new characters are introduced, and I did like most of them (Bar Primera, she sucks). The new cast is quirky, yet there also is more to them than just their quirk. Wether it be Tatra and Tarta and how wonderfully they contrast each other, Asuka and her endless childishness, or Eagle Vision’s calm, polite demeanor, the new characters certainly don’t fail to be entertaining. Hell, even Lantis, despite looking and sounding identically like him, somehow managed to avoid being a blatant copy of his Brother.<br />
<br />
That said, the same cannot be said about the final villains. To wit, Debonair is boring, with absolutely nothing going for her other than being the embodiment of fear or some crap like that. By contrast, Nova is just annoying. Look, I don’t mind Yanderes, but the problem is that Nova’s dialogue is extremely repetitive, with her basically repeating the same sentences over and over again, which is not helped by the fact that there is literally nothing else to her. I was quite happy when she got killed off, to say the least.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
It’s a slight upgrade over Season 1. In general, everything looks crisper, the movement is far more fluid, and the Animation is just better in almost every way possible. I also have to commend the artists as they did a great job at differentiating the different factions. Characters from Cephiro all look like if they were right out of a traditional fairy tale, Autozam is very clearly inspired by multiple Cyberpunk stories, Fahren is a very clear China expy, and Chizeta is a very nice homage to classic Arabian folklore. Say whatever you want about CLAMP’s artstyle, they sure know how to make their characters varied in terms of design<br />
<br />
No Mecha section as it’s basically the same as the last Season. Moving on!<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is as good as always, with all the songs fitting their respective scenes and characters. As for the Opening and Ending themes, I did admittedly quite like “Hikari to Kage wo Dakishimeta Mama” and “Itsuka Kagayaku”, but I didn’t really care for “Kirai wa Narenai” and just plain disliked “Lullaby ~Yasashiku Dakasete~”.<br />
<br />
Voice Actor:<br />
<br />
Bar Okiayu Ryotaro, the whole cast from Season 1 returns and does a great job as always. This does include Ogata Megumi and Kosugi Jurota, whose characters were killed off back in Season 1. The way they went about it is quite nice, with Kosugi now playing Zagato’s brother Lantis and using basically the same performance, all the while Ogata gets to play into her more usual typecasting as the effeminate yet clearly male Eagle Vision. On that note, Takayama Minami gets a chance to use her huskier voice in this Season due to Ascott getting a growth spurt, which is nice. Beside them there’s Itou Miki, Otsuka Akio, Inoue Kikuko, Genda Tessho, Hisakawa Aya, Yanada Kiyoyuki, Koorogi Satomi, Kakemaru Junichi and Shiratori Yuri.<br />
<br />
Overall: <br />
<br />
While not a perfect show, not even a great one, I do feel that this Season was better than the last one. It had its flaws, sure, but I did overall enjoy myself. If you liked Season 1, I’d say you should watch it. If you didn’t though, I would say no, as while it is better, there isn’t enough different so that someone who didn’t like Season 1 would like it. Still though, as far as I am concerned, it was pretty good.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 8/10

    Overall: this was a really enjoyable show with a lot of flaws, that was not as strong as the the first season.  It probably could have been sped up, have some things fleshed out with others cut out, and been a shorter season.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good stuff: <br />
<br />
- The production isn&#039;t bad.  The music is decent and the art looks like it got a bigger budget than season 1, although there are definitely episodes with super inconsistent/lower quality art.  Still pretty decent for the time period.<br />
<br />
- There are a lot more story threads and interesting new worldbuilding!  Overall just very enjoyable as a show.<br />

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417002">
        Eagle is basically the best thing about this show.  In fact, he&#039;s so good, I think it actually does a disservice to the rest of the show.  Eagle is far and away the strongest best-written character, due in large part to him and Autozam in general having really strong and meaningful motivations, whereas the rest of the characters have either selfish, silly, or wishy-washy motivations.  I loved Eagle&#039;s storyline, although part of me feels like he should have been in a different show.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Issues:<br />
<br />
- As is common with older anime, the pacing is super slow.  I had trouble finishing it until I started watching it at 1.5x speed - and most of the time it didn&#039;t even feel sped up.<br />
<br />
- The majority of the characters are not very consistent or well-written:<br />
  * The Magic Knights - Hikaru has a very limited character arc with Nova and her emotional problems, but there&#039;s just not enough there to sustain through 29 episodes.  It also feels like the writers didn&#039;t know what to do with Umi and Fuu, so they don&#039;t get much real development.<br />
  * Fahren and Chizeta - these characters feel like they&#039;re just goofy comedic characters, which would be fine except that they&#039;re held up next to Autozam who have a serious meaningful storyline.  I really feel like this show would have been fine as a cute funny fantasy adventure if they had removed the more serious aspects, and would have felt more consistent in tone.<br />
  * LaFarga, Caldina, Ascot, and Mokona - they were clearly added only as nostalgia from the last season, and never seemed to have anything to do.<br />
  * Sierra - I won&#039;t spoil too much but her small storyline didn&#039;t end up mattering.  This probably didn&#039;t need to be in the story unless they were planning to properly expand this.<br />
  * Debonair and Nova - they felt kind of half-baked as villains.  There was a half-decent idea here but it lacked the depth it needed to carry the season.<br />
  * Annoying Fairy - I forget her name but why was she even here?  She had no purpose or character growth, and eventually effectively disappeared from the story without it really affecting anything.<br />
  * Lantis - I think he had a lot of potential, but the writers didn&#039;t seem to have a plan for him.  He had some interesting things laid out early on, but we almost never circled back on any of it.  <br />
<br />
- The romance storylines are all kind of mediocre or bad.  Fuu and Ferio barely get any additional time or development, Umi&#039;s romance options end up being pretty vague, and Hikaru&#039;s romance is very insta-love and doesn&#039;t get the development it should for how much it&#039;s propped up as a really important part of the story.  There are also several (unnecessary imo) unrequited love threads that don&#039;t go anywhere, and a side romance that had no real basis and also isn&#039;t really needed.  I may be biased, but Eagle/Lantis seemed like the most compelling relationship in the show, even if it wasn&#039;t really canon.<br />
<br />
- The continued lack of even a basic soft magic system led to an abruptness and lack of tension in the battle scenes.  Maybe I&#039;m too used to shounen, but it felt like they needed at least a tiny amount of explanation around what magic the knights could use and when.  I&#039;m still confused by why they didn&#039;t combine rune gods and use their super attack pretty much every time.<br />
<br />
- The storyline overall is somewhat inconsistent and not very well planned.  By the end I was rooting for Autozam?  I also don&#039;t love the ending of season 2, as it feels like it undermined the story of season 1.

    frustrating is really the only word i can think of finishing this up. i was so ready to love this, the first series, despite the nearly overwhelming love to JRPG tropes and general isekai-ness, was a entertaining series with really great characters, setting and a shockingly good twist at the end. so seeing that the 2nd series all but dropped the JRPG and isekai stuff in favor for a story i found much more interesting was all but good signs, and as a result the first couple episodes are great! the magic knights have all clearly learned and you can feel their bond, the returning

          <span style="display: none;" id="review375048">
        characters, well not as active or important, still keep their personality and charm, and then the new characters from the 3 invading countries are all great in their own right, with amazing designs to boot.<br />
<br />
but then nova fully enters the story, and she may be one of the worst villains i&#039;ve ever seen in any media. her theme of self hate is a very interesting one on paper, but the character is horrible. she just repeats the same lines over and over and over again, if you replaced her with a soundboard that just goes &quot;I Love You Hikaru&quot;, &quot;I Love Everything You/Hikaru Hates&quot;, i genuinely don&#039;t think you would see a difference in dialog until the last episode. just a horrible character, and to make things worst, she only has a connection with hikaru. now that would be fine if she wasn&#039;t more or less the main villain of the series, certainly the one with the most screen time. so that leaves umi and fuu with nothing to do for what is ultimately the main plot of the show.<br />
<br />
rayearth 2 as a whole mainly focused on hikaru and officially made her the main character, which i was pretty weary of. sure in the original show she was always kind of the leader, but her, umi and fuu all got the same amount of development and it never felt like that development came at the expense of others. but again, i did really enjoy hikaru in the original series, and it&#039;s more serious plot, i&#039;m fine with their being 1 main character for a more focused story. but that focus is just so boring and overbearing that it honestly kinda ruins the show. i already mentioned nova and how any scene with her is pretty horrible, but the love triangle between hikaru, lantis and eagle is just so boring. like wow.<br />
<br />
<br />
hikaru is a interesting and entertaining character with lots of chemistry with fuu and umi, along with most of the first series&#039; characters. lantis is a cool character with a interesting background and relationship with clef. eagle vision is a classic ogata character of being intelligent, charming and calm, along with a lot of fun interactions between himself and his crew, plus a cool (and very homoerotic) former friendship with lantis. you add these 3 characters together and it&#039;s just such a impressive slog. hikaru has no chemistry with these two, she works with lantis once and barely has any screentime with him afterwards but never stops talking about him. with eagle sure she spends more time with him, but it&#039;s not really anything interesting or substantial and robs eagle of his much more interesting relationships with geo and lantis, and hikaru of her relationship with fuu and umi. hikaru just becomes the most boring character in the show when with these 2, which is where the bulk of her screentime comes from, along with the nova stuff. it&#039;s even more frustrating because this show can do romance and they do it well in the 1st series. fuu and ferio&#039;s relationship added a ton to her character and didn&#039;t come at the expense of hikaru and umi, or fuu&#039;s relationship with them.<br />
<br />
<br />
it&#039;s even more frustrating because everything not focusing on those 2 things is fantastic. aska is a hilarious character with a pretty understated romance with sung yang, along with a adorable friendship with fuu. umi is a absolute bad ass against tatra and tarta, who themselves are a amazing comedic duo and bring the coolest fight scenes to the show. well the returning characters besides clef are all much more minor but their protection of the castle and interaction among themselves and with the magic knights are all great little bits of world building. hell even the 3 magic knights, the times where they interact and are together (which is honestly very rare), are still fantastic characters and have a very real bond. <br />
<br />
but again, that&#039;s just where even more of the frustration comes from. all the stuff i liked and found interesting, is not the main focus, it&#039;s not even really hugely important to the main story. sure umi taking on both of tarta and tatra is a awesome scene and great for her character, but it really has no connection to the story the show wants to tell, which is of hikaru and her relationship with nova. sure fuu talking it out with aska until they can agree to drink tea is a funny and a heartwarming scene that shows the strength of fuu&#039;s character, but it ultimately has nothing to do with the love triangle that the show is much much more interested in telling. it&#039;s just so frustrating, i feel like i can&#039;t get glimpses of the show i wanna see and am loving, and then get snapped back to what the show is actually interested in telling.<br />
<br />
so in the end, i just kinda view the whole thing as a disappointment. there is so much promise and potential, that gets so close to be fulfilled, but is never able to. i am very interested in reading the manga version, seeing as nova isn&#039;t a character there and i have more faith in CLAMP for a engaging romance. but as for the anime, yeah i would say it&#039;s ultimately weaker then the 1st series, which is such a shame. <br />
<br />
i still cried at it ending though ;_;

    Well, watching this season hard on the heels of the first season is a mistake.  You should allow yourself a couple days between them simply to absorb the first season fully.<br />
<br />
That said, however, this season is as good in some ways as the first one.  Granted the land is missing and you have only one scene that isn&#039;t a spaceship or in space, but they manage to make do with what they do have.  <br />
<br />
The story is what I like to focus on, and there this season is a worthy successor.  It took what could have been an awkward ending to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review84147">
        the first season and continued it along logically and believably.  I was not upset by the reuse of a plot device, and there was less of a video game feel to it, and more of a real emergent situation that needed to be dealt with now.  <br />
<br />
You get some more backstory in this, but in my opinion it focuses too much on one character, leaving the other two to languish in near obscurity.  They do have their moments however.  Additional characters are introduced, and the only complaint I have with that is that the three invading nations who are coming appear to only have two or three people on the entire huge capital ships until nearly three quarters of the way through the series, then you find out there are actually other people there.  True, those others are cutouts and one dimensional, sometimes nearly literally, but they do exist.<br />
<br />
The stories weave together in a tight whole though and I was very interested to watch it.  The plot twist at the end is nearly anticlimactic as they have been hinting at this, and giving it away in the main opening sequence, since the series started.  However, that said, the REAL plot twist really does surprise.<br />
<br />
If you enjoyed the first season, you will enjoy this one more.  I think it&#039;s a good sequel, and I would have liked it to continue on, with the heroines resting on their laurels in the place they helped create.
