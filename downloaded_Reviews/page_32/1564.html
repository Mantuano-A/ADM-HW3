    Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? Of the Dead! <br />
<br />
The 2nd season of Kore wa Zombie Desu ka, starts off where they left off from the previous season. Introducing a new character, the mysterious pink, curly-haired Kris. And still following the misunderstood life of Aikawa Ayumu.<br />
<br />
Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? of the Dead, or Is this a Zombie? of the Dead, starts with no plot whatsoever. Rather it just does some character build up for each character. So the supporting cast from last season, are now sharing the spotlight with the main crew. In just ten episodes, Studio Deen fails to deliver a &quot;full season,&quot; so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review59509">
        it leaves you wanting a 3rd season. But it does have its redeeming qualities too. It has it&#039;s nice comedy that always has you laughing, and the moe. Oh my gosh, THE MOE is just too epic to describe.<br />
<br />
If you liked Kore wa Zombie Desu ka, the first season, then I urge you to watch this.

    &quot;Till death do us apart&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh really? There are a lot of series these days about zombies, the walking dead, and ghosts. Just looking at this Spring Season, we have Sankarea and Dusk Maiden of Amnesia. Then, there&#039;s Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? of the Dead. Death certainly doesn&#039;t do them apart. In fact, those characters are among the world of the living and they breath the same air we do.<br />
<br />
Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? of the Dead also known as &quot;Is This a Zombie? Of the Dead&quot; is the sequel of the original series adapted from the manga. For those who have watched season 1,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review63021">
        there was an actual storyline involving zombies, vampire ninjas, and necromancer. But in this sequel, where&#039;s the story? Of course, that&#039;s a problem especially in comedies like this these days. Whether you&#039;re an avid anime elitist or a casual fan, storyline is usually imperative to craft a series we can enjoy. If you&#039;re looking for a powerful storyline, then you&#039;re in the wrong place because in this sequel, the storyline is dead as a zombie.<br />
<br />
Having that being said, there is quite a lot of humor every episode. Some of the common cliche are also present in the typical ecchi and harem themes ranges from the all cute adorable delusions that Ayumu have towards Eu to the brutal tsundere known as Seraphim. It&#039;s not surprise either considering there&#039;s no storyline and this is almost like a parody. It tries to make us laugh but thankfully, it succeeded somewhat; at least in most cases. Well, I wouldn&#039;t call it hilarious to the point of being labeled as blockbuster but it definitely has guts, the guts to pull off some stunts with Ayumu&#039;s &quot;harem&quot;. Between some scenes though, there are some surprisingly heartwarming moments (especially involving our beloved necromancer) but most of these times, it&#039;s twisted into a more brutal way with bloody gags.<br />
<br />
The plot for this sequel is technically nonexistent. Even if it had one, it would probably go straight to hell like our main character. Further more to Ayumu&#039;s screwed up life is his ways of dealing with the situations in his undead life. It seems that however it goes, it always ends up being embarrassing him to the extreme. (at least in his view anyways) Despite introducing some new characters like the butt-loving Sarasvati, the return of Kyoko, and the loli nurse Chris, the series fails to execute their part in the storyline. Did we see a true character development? Did we see them actually getting into the story? By &quot;into&quot;, I mean storyline-wise where they play their parts besides the typical harem cliche and fan-service.<br />
<br />
Hence, let the randomness flourish.<br />
<br />
KoreZom of the Dead does attempt these randomness in a way that brings out the laughter from our faces and I have to admit it again, it succeeded in some ways. Whether it&#039;s the perverted actions of Ayumu during his harem scenes or the parody references, it does achieve the entertainment value. Those Eu delusions that our weak protagonist Ayumu plays and replays in his mind are entertaining and who doesn&#039;t like our beloved vampire ninja Seraphim talk trash 24/7?<br />
<br />
Then, there&#039;s the fanservice.<br />
<br />
For the fans, the service is delivered more than just the maid cosplay episode. Even for some of the typical &quot;fights&quot;, there is fanservice. A clear example is the in final episode of the typical &quot;perverted slime&quot;. For those who has tuned in High School DxD last season, you&#039;d get a good idea. Is this really necessary? Well, for entertainment and eye candies, yes. For storyline, I&#039;ll give you a hell no.<br />
<br />
Now, the OP song for the series is surprisingly addictive and passionate. In fact, &quot;Passionate&quot; by Iori Nomizi is sung in a way that delivers dialogues that is different every episode at the end. It does keep the viewers watch those delicious girls all over the screen and as well as their cute/seductive poses. Or maybe, it might spawn some envy and jealousy toward our zombie. As for the background music, it&#039;s all just so-so, not something too note worthy.<br />
<br />
As for art, is it artistic and valuable? Considering the fact that Studio Deen is involved in this might make some fans turn their heads away. But surprisingly, it doesn&#039;t ruin the series at all. In fact, the art is artistic this time around and some of the intermissions are quite catchy. When viewed in HQ, it almost looks like a cover of a book.<br />
<br />
KoreZom of the Dead in the end is for people who values more on entertainment than a real series. What this means is that you should probably focus on the humor that the show desperately tries to pull out of their hats rather than a decent storyline. Yes, it&#039;s true, it&#039;s damn true. If you&#039;re expecting a storyline like season 1, then you can kiss it goodbye faster than the ED song. All that is nonexistent. If perhaps that doesn&#039;t get your attention, then perhaps some cross-dressing and Eu delusions might open your eyes a bit. With a strong arsenal of humor, parody, and dynamics, this series is one of those shows that perhaps you might decide to watch after a long week of work or school. But if you&#039;re looking for some sort of intriguing story, then turn your heads away now. You came to the wrong place. All in all, KoreZom of the Dead is one of those humor series that tries to be funny and succeeded in doing so. If not anything, it&#039;s entertainment in its most cliched form and usage.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, we have Ayumu and his harem to pay gratitude for that.

    What happens when you mix a zombie, a necromancer, a vampire ninja, and a magical girl? You get this steaming pile of shit. <br />
<br />
This is a sequel to the moderately entertaining, yet painfully average first season of the same title. The problem with the first season was that it had no idea what it was doing- It tried to be some strange mix of serious plot and comedy, yet it failed spectacularly. No, I&#039;m not claiming that because it was a mix that it was bad- It was bad because it was just very poorly done and because it was actually really bad. Not only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review100799">
        were the relevant plot elements very briefly skimmed over to make room for overdone comedy sequences which were only funny the first time, but the main conflict of the show turned out to be extremely uninteresting and generic. In the end, it delivered neither, and just ended up being a very average and generic harem show. After that mediocrity, one would expect that the sequel would be much more interesting- It could give the audience more background information regarding the world of this series, and not have rehashes of the same jokes, right?<br />
<br />
Well, too fucking bad. Have more of the worst parts from Season 1. <br />
<br />
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
<br />
There is practically no story. Well, there is- But there are even less relevant plot materials to work with, the pacing is even more garbage, and the villain somehow manages to be even less interesting and less relevant than the previous villain. Every episode is given some brief &quot;foreshadowing&quot; segments with a certain character, which seems to be this series&#039; attempt at building up for something. That something turns out to be an unrewarding episode of sudden exposition dump eight episodes into the series, and the villain turning out to be a character the audience has seen for few minutes every other episode or so. The villain spouts out some uninteresting monologue that audience would&#039;ve cared about if the series did a better job in getting the audience to care about the characters or plot at all. Also, nobody ever really &quot;dies&quot; in this series, so there really isn&#039;t anything threatening or &#039;climactic&#039; about this at all. It&#039;s just there for the sake of trying to have a plot, and nothing else. Even the last few episodes didn&#039;t do anything- Was there a conflict? Sure. Did that conflict ever become something more relevant than a Saturday morning cartoon villain threat? No. Overall, none of these plot elements that were supposed to be relevant turned out to be relevant at all, leading the audience to question why they were introduced in the first place. At least make the jokes funnier than the typical MC is a pervert gag routine, which isn&#039;t even really a joke, but more of an excuse to show more 2D tits under the premise of a joke. <br />
<br />
The art style is pretty bland and the animation is nothing spectacular, since it&#039;s a DEEN show. Though to be fair, I didn&#039;t expect much in the first place- And I don&#039;t think anyone would&#039;ve either. I mean, it&#039;s fucking DEEN. I guess the OP sequence is quite misleading as to showing how much effort actually went into the animation, though.<br />
<br />
Despite a lot of mediocre shows having average to pretty nice music, this is not the case here-  The soundtrack in this show is dreadful. While it would be silly to judge a show based solely on the soundtrack, I think this needs to be pointed out. Most of the tracks sound pretty much exactly the fucking same, and obviously there&#039;s no effort put into any of them. Nearly none of them feel appropriate for the scenes they&#039;re played in, and since the show shifts the mood way too frequently, even the track is appropriate on one rare occasion, it doesn&#039;t stick for very long.<br />
<br />
And the characters are definitely the worst part. The characters are barely given any depth outside of the cliches they established themselves into during the first season- Meaning, these characters do not develop in any shape or form. While I&#039;m not really looking for some masterful character development from shows like these, there literally is none. Seraphim keeps saying vulgar words to the MC because that&#039;s totally hilarious, and stopped being funny since her introduction episode in the first season. Eucliwood still does her overdone VA gag and Ayumu following it up with fantasizing about it. Haruna is that generic tsundere, Yuki is that character that wants Ayumu&#039;s dick, and Sarasvati is that character that wants Ayumu&#039;s butt. Hey look, I just dumped every single gag this show utilizes. So brilliant.<br />
<br />
This also leads to one of the worst character destruction I&#039;ve seen in a series- Kyouko, a character that had some semblance of plot relevancy as the direct murderer of Ayumu, which would then lead up to the events that began the entire fucking series, becomes a trashy harem fodder. Despite this character being pretty threatening in the first season, and making people believe she would play a similar role in this season with the opening, she was instantly written n the last five minutes of the episode where she was reintroduced to love Ayumu. She was misunderstood all along! Flawless. Why even try, right? Of course, it turns out to be even more of a baffling writing direction since this character actually stops being relevant canonically since she gets thrown into the prison and is never shown again. Strip the character of all their dignity and quality and kick them out of the series permanently. Nice. Glad you were part of the show. Never show your face again please. <br />
<br />
This series is very confused. Clearly the series&#039; biggest problem is that it tries too hard to pander to the terrible part of the audience- And it ultimately turns out to be forgettable, even for those that it&#039;s pandering to. From the perspective of fans that only look for fanservice in a show like this, once they&#039;re done watching the show and finished caressing themselves gently over it, they&#039;re more than likely to just forget about the show completely and move to a different series with the same trashy material. Meanwhile, people who would otherwise like the series because of its unique and catchy premise have been annoyed by all the pandering are going to forget because this show is just bad due to its lack of focus. Why not just stick with one audience? Why introduce serious plot to begin with? <br />
<br />
Ok, so let&#039;s pretend this show didn&#039;t have any serious plot- Would it be good? No. While comedy may be very much subjective, when that something is overdone, then it&#039;s objectively stale by definition. And when comedy is stale, then you&#039;re doing an awful fucking job. Just because this might be a fanservice focused show doesn&#039;t mean it has to be bad. No one should try to justify a show&#039;s shortcomings by artificially lowering their standards based on its genre because that&#039;s stupid. Just like this show.

    Imagine a world with vampire ninjas who don&#039;t suck blood? A necromancer whose words alone will leave you in a fatal condition . Where a masou shoujo runs about with a deadly chainsaw? Yes there exists such a preposterous world. This anime&#039;s creativity is incomparable. Get ready for some jaw-droping action which leaves you dazzled. Its all here in Kore wa Zombie Desu Ka? of The Dead; The second season! I can&#039;t even express how I feel right now after watching the first episode to the sequel of one of my favorite animes of all time! I&#039;m just overwhelmed with joy. I get to see

          <span style="display: none;" id="review58125">
        the cross dressing deviant Ayumu Aikawa masou shoujo in action once again which makes my heart skip a beat not that I&#039;m gay or anything but I&#039;m not sure the same goes with the squid megalo. If your a fan of eechi, action &amp; especially masou shouji&#039;s look no further this anime is meant for you! I&#039;m sure it will satisfy all your needs. You&#039;ll never get bored with the vampire ninja Seraphim&#039;s sarcastic jokes of the perverted Ayumu. The only the thing which I think this anime is missing is a well developed plot. It&#039;s all random events which take place which are of complete irrelevance to the next episode. Otherwise this anime shines as bright as any other, so look no further &amp; venture into the world of masou shoujo&#039;s! <br />

    Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? of the Dead is very similar to the first season. What made first season very enjoyable to watch was how ridiculously funny/random the story itself is, and I&#039;m glad that the second season brings more of the same. The major downside is that unlike the first season where characters are somewhat developed and there was at least a plot, there is almost none of those in the second season. The main cause was the pacing. The plot probably could have been finished within the second season, yet they chose to drag it out and leave it unfinished, which made a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review151179">
        somewhat poor ending as well. Furthermore, the main characters did not develop at all, and their relationship stayed nearly the same after the end of the first season. It seems like the second season chose fan service over real character development (that was also somewhat the case for the first season), using the kawaii Eucliwood, the well-endowed Seraphim, the insane/immature tsundere Haruna, and several others. It worked to some degree, even though the harem/ecchi cliche has been used by over hundreds of animes. In the end, I do not understand how the average score for the second season is higher than the first season, since there are quite a few flaws and no real qualities with this anime. <br />
<br />
With that said, the second season was still very enjoyable to watch. Referring back to the beginning, what made this anime attractive in the first place was how ridiculously funny the story is, even though it was lacking in the second season. It is quite easy to laugh at really silly scenes, and in the end I found entertainment in this anime. It&#039;s just good, but it won&#039;t be anything more than that.

    This was nothing compared to season 1: Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka<br />
<br />
They mashed so much otaku related fan service like maid cafes and water melon smashing at beaches that the story was completely pushed out.<br />
If you watched the first season you will know it also contained this type of stuff but the core story was good. However season 2&#039;s core story could have fit into 2 episodes.<br />
Doubt this will get a season 3 seeing as how bad this season was it&#039;s a real shame the first season was one of the best animes I&#039;ve ever watched.

    Ok, so now the 2nd season has ended, how does this anime fare up? Well, it doesn&#039;t, I&#039;d probabaly say that this is one anime that was once rated as good (in the 1st season) gone poor (this 2nd season), then agin the story still deserves a &quot;Mediocre&quot; number 5, since the plot and setting is sitll there and still the same, and it is only limited to that since the expected climax is not what was being hope for, as for the genre, there is that mystery element that pertains to Chris and the relationship about the underworlds and the mashou shojos that has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review62945">
        contribute a lot to the plot of this anime.<br />
<br />
Art: Mediocre 5<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t say why, since it is pretty obvious.<br />
<br />
Sound: Mediocre 5.<br />
<br />
Ok so I really hate both opening and closing themes, but such rating in this part still deserves to get a 5 since the seiyus are still the same.<br />
<br />
Character: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
So far the main cast are still there, so the rating is for the support cast whom are given more air time roles and for the other  &quot;Moe&quot; support characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:Fair 6.<br />
<br />
So far aside the usual genre, I do find the fanservice and mystery element enjoyable, since the things we don&#039;t expect suddenly came about, the spoiler here is that there is only one episode were there is a Megalo battle in it. The rest are mostly compose of the misadventures of the main character. <br />
<br />
Overall: Poor 3.<br />
<br />
Overall the entire 10 episode of this season 2 is rather disappointing, co&#039;z I kind expect a climatic battle to arrive in the last episode, instead an alternative is presented  were it is the master vs the slave kind of thing that happen, It is too early to say about how the up coming OVA will fare up, but I&#039;m hoping for some Ayumu vs Chis kind of thing for the up coming OVA.<br />
<br />
Season 3? IMAO unlikely.........maybe.<br />
<br />

    We all have our share of light shows to take a break from the deeper recesses of the anime world. There are times when memorable characters, fountains of gore, bizarre interpretations, thought-provoking themes, and eyegasmic animation leave a certain impact that burn our watching mojos out. So when I was warned by my friend about a cancer-inducing show involving a crossdressing zombie, I just told myself, “Why the hell not?” <br />
<br />
What I got was a hysterical regurgitation of cliches, genre executions, and typical anime scenarios seamlessly smashed into one show, with an amazing dub if I may add. I can guarantee ‘Is This a Zombie?’

          <span style="display: none;" id="review176003">
        and its redundant companion, ‘Is This a Zombie? of the Dead’, are a buttload of gut-busting fun, if you pardon the lack of anything substantial.<br />
<br />
STORY - 6<br />
<br />
After being murdered by an unknown serial killer, Ayumu Aikawa, lackadaisical high-schooler, is soon resurrected and turned into a zombie by necromancer, Eucliwood Hellscythe. While Season 1 tells about the pursuit of his assassin and the mastermind behind the murders, Season 2 scales it up by showing glimpses of all factions and impending threats that foreshadow possible sequels. Bottom line, Season 2 is such a tease.<br />
<br />
But let’s face it. The plot in this show comes and goes. We have serious moments interspersed with happy fun times. The plot felt more supplementary, in that it gave the show direction as well as provide more room for scenarios and genres to play out. The real appeal of Is This a Zombie? comes from its amassed referential content that either pays homage or pokes fun at the familiar tropes we&#039;ve all watched before.<br />
<br />
It’s not everyday you get to see a perverted harem protagonist-turned-zombie moonlighting as a magical girl while living with an ex-magical girl, necromancer and a vampire ninja as they fend off against demonic animals of the underworld. And that’s only the premise. <br />
<br />
Joining the mix are zombies, demons, magical girls, vampires, ninjas, excessive bloodshed, crossdressing, blatant fan-service (and disservice), transformation scenes, manga artists, gender bender, some yuri and yaoi, gunpla, awkward product placement, classical music performances, maid cafes, karuta, school competitions and festivals, amusement parks, idols and rock stars, pool/beach/hot spring sequences, slime and tentacles, and attack call-outs to name a few; not to mention the abundance of shout-outs and running gags that spice everything up. It amazes me how many scenarios they can streamline into one show while still carrying out a plot.<br />
<br />
As for the genre, the show is primarily a supernatural harem school comedy sugarcoated with slice-of-life and infused with elements of horror, mystery, action, and drama.<br />
<br />
Despite all of the above, it manages to pull off each respective genre decently. Though 80% of the time you’ll be seeing the main cast faffing around when nothing urgent is taking place, the 20% dedicated to the more gripping parts of the show actually take you for a ride, albeit a rather short one. <br />
<br />
ART - 7<br />
<br />
I would just like to point out that Studio Deen made this. There&#039;s a noticeable blur reminiscent of their previous works as well as a slight nod to a particular show of theirs with crying cicadas evident in some eerily similar character designs and facial contortions. Setting that aside…<br />
<br />
Is This a Zombie? makes use of a lot of shine, shade, and haze when scenery demands it. But when it doesn&#039;t, the scenes come out really flat and half-baked, only to be slightly bleached in light with ample shadows. This appearance can be attributed to the lethal combination of blur, choppy movements, single-toned colors, and awkwardly visible outlines. Normally, the flat look complements most of the comic relief when designs start getting goofy. Taken another way, it feels as if the show is strewn with budget cuts by putting the detail down on some frames. <br />
<br />
Come dusk to night however, these detriments surprisingly work. Light and shadow are given more attention. The blur adds depth of field while the sheen and slight murk combined with the crisp outlines and softer dark colors make the characters stand out from the grim and fuzzy backdrop. In a sense, the art behaves just like the characters. It comes to life at night and whiles away the day. The same goes for the action sequences whether dire or wacky, except with added sparks, shimmer, smoke, and gore to elevate the energy from the usual slice-of-life going on. <br />
<br />
The character designs fully accentuate each character’s archetype. From the dullness of Ayumu’s design to the various hairstyles, outfits, eye colors, and body types of the leading ladies, the designs evoke as much personality as their individual actions and words. The factions are also made distinct as seen by the underworlders sporting more garb and medieval flair, the magical girls having more childlike physiques and frilly clothing, and the vampire ninjas being both classy and sexy while possessing more angular features.  <br />
<br />
SOUND - 9<br />
<br />
The J-rock openings served their purpose in pumping me up for the next episode while the endings were cute to remind me that I’m here to have fun. Who doesn&#039;t enjoy an ending sequence where every girl of said harem puckers up in front of you? BGM isn&#039;t memorable but does its part in achieving the intended atmosphere for each mood. But that’s not why the sound is rated pretty high.<br />
<br />
Is This a Dub for Is This a Zombie?<br />
<br />
I haven’t watched it subbed and frankly I don’t need to. Funimation’s dub of Is This a Zombie? reaches “godly” in my books. It can easily contend with the sub not only in voice compatibility and performance, but also in script and lip-syncing, as well as honoring the original’s running gag of Eucliwood’s multiple voice actresses to resemble Ayumu’s perverted fantasies. These funny tidbits also feature an all-star cast of dub veterans such as Colleen Clinkenbeard, Luci Christian, Brina Palencia, Jamie Marchi, Alexis Tipton, and Emily Neves among others. Even the in-episode singing is dubbed right.<br />
<br />
Ayumu gets his lax and easy-going nature thanks to Austin Tindle. Anthony Bowling’s Orito gives the pervy best friend a flexible vocal range; high when he’s spazzing out and low when he’s being sincere or calculating. Jad Saxton nails the lovably annoying magical girl Haruna and her immature smack talk. Fresh talent Morgan Garrett as vampire ninja Seraphim condescends her way into our hearts with her frigid and seductive tone coupled with the dub script’s hefty load of sophisticatedly blunt insults. Dominatrix, rump-lover, part-time idol and fellow vampire ninja Sarasvati gets a more fiery and sadistic rendition of Seraphim’s tone with veteran Caitlin Glass. Brittney Karbowski pulls out all the stops in delivering the cutest and ditziest girl-next-door voice for other vampire ninja, Maelstrom. Eucliwood’s main VA, Cherami Leigh, shines in her sparse lines; granting the faux-mute necromancer a troubled yet endearingly hushed personality with an ethereal voice that wouldn&#039;t hurt a fly. Monica Rial carries the role of magical girl teacher Ariel with playful yet well-mannered inflections. Stephanie Sheh achieves the identical shrill pitch for antagonist, Chris; with special mention to her childishly adorable drunk ramblings. On the other end of the spectrum, Eric Vale breaks the the silly monotony with an intimidatingly serious King of the Night; providing the grit and bravado the undead villain deserves. Lastly, Lindsay Seidel is bloody good as deranged Kyoko, Erica Harte does Taeko’s shrinking violet and wife-material persona justice, and Megan Miller’s Kanami stands out among the other girls and their wacky antics with a notch of indifference and maturity. Everyone else is well-cast and would probably lengthen this paragraph too much.<br />
<br />
As for the script, the lines are chock-full of risque euphemisms and Western slang. Funimation took full liberty in translation and though the interpretation is different, the energy and spirit of the original are kept. This makes the dub more enjoyable and less forced while giving space for equal appreciation of both languages. You cannot go wrong either way and neither will hamper the fun, feels, laughs, horror, and action the show has to offer. As solid as the sub will always be for most anime, I could not ask for a better dub done by Funimation.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS - 6<br />
<br />
In a show that just screams archetypes and references, it’s no surprise that the characters are static and one-dimensional. What captures my fancy though is the chemistry the main gang has; i.e. Ayumu being the punching bag of everyone’s verbal and literal fists.<br />
<br />
When plot isn’t in the way, the characters are simply placed in random and awkward situations which always end up beating the snot (and innards) out of our sorry protagonist. As the episodes proceed, all those comedic gestures, sarcastic abuse, and pandering become endearing in a weird way. Gradually, the harem treatment transitions to a family dynamic between the characters.<br />
<br />
Though there will be inevitable moments of attraction from female characters, the protagonist can own up to them, not because he can take a lot of punishment, but because he’s a ballsy guy when push comes to shove. He may be able to endure the humiliation and physical tortures of being a zombie every day but you resonate with his unwavering need to reintegrate back into society. In the end, all he wants is to be at home despite his newfound immortality and lo and behold, he forms a network with various people he can call home; some assurance that the eternity he is doomed or blessed to live will be a bit less lonely.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT - 10<br />
<br />
If you’re up for a variety show with easy characters and a lot of service, help yourself. From the title, it&#039;s as if even the show doesn&#039;t know what it is. It’s everything and nothing at the same time; culminating so many conventions that it becomes something hilariously unconventional. Is This a Zombie? is a hodgepodge of everything we love about anime at face value. It may be a feast… but it’s a feast of leftovers.<br />
<br />
What it boasts in blatantly obvious cliches, awesome dub-work, and fun and accessible content, it lacks in focus, substance and some production qualities. Take the protagonist’s advice:<br />
<br />
“I&#039;ve learned that it&#039;s best to just go with it no matter how ridiculous the premise might sound.” - Ayumu Aikawa<br />
<br />
OVERALL - 8<br />

    Well, much like the first season of the show this is a joke (once again, no insult was intended, rather everything is turned into a joke in this show). <br />
Im all for comedy and this brings it too the table, but theres a couple problems I noticed this time around that werent present in season one. First of all, this time the jokes arent coming at you in arapid-fire manner where you are bound to laugh, simply because of a quanity  over quality thing. Second, some of the material is ripped off of the first season so its not gonna be that funny this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review86863">
        time. Also some components of the story are basically a mirror to the first season, and it kinda starts the same.  <br />
The characters are the same, and that is kinda a problem because you have to step up and elevate the story otherwise people are bound to look down on a show. The one new person brought in is meant to be a big badass supervillain who brings the show to a dramatic climax, but that never happens and the show is just kinda a flat-line in terms of excitement, the saving grace is that the flat line starts at about and 8 thanks to season one.<br />
The characters: a zombie, a necromancer, 2 vampire ninjas (cuz, one or the other isnt enough) and a good half dozen magical garment girls( I still dont get the name). This is a type of harem, and by the time this is done with the main(only) guy has a good 7 or 8 girls after him.<br />
I dont want anybody tho think that I look down on this show, rather I did really enjoy season 2 almost as much as season one. The humor is still there and it better be since thats what this show was founded on.

    When watching Is this a Zombie? Of The Dead, i was hoping that I would enjoy it as much as the first season. And I wasn&#039;t disappointed for the most part. There were quite a few things that erked me about this season that I couldn&#039;t look pass, as I did with the 1st season. But, as this review goes on I&#039;ll explain more.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
After Ayumu and the crew defeat that other Zombie, their life is peaceful for the most part until new and old enemies make their appearances. I found the enemies to be pretty underwhelming and barely filled their roles as enemies as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181483">
        well. Conflict-wise I feel as if the show didn&#039;t have a strong enough conflict and resolve either. All problems just float away without being really resolved. This was only really noticeable because of other features I feel that the show sorta lacked in this season. I&#039;ll explain what I mean when I right down my option on enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
As I&#039;ve said before, I&#039;m not a great judge when it comes to Art but this shows was just fine IMO. Nothing wrong with it. Pretty consistent through out the entirety of the show. Only thing that changed was the size of Mael Strom&#039;s boobs. When under a regular shirt, they&#039;re like medium size, but let it have cleavage and that shit EXPANDS. (boob bounces were on point though LOL)<br />
<br />
Sound: 7.5<br />
This time around I took a better listen to the soundtrack and what not and realized they make the scenes slightly more intense, when those kind of scenes appear. In general, the show knows how to make a scene have a certain mood to it without music but, it was nice that it just added a bit more of a defining factor to it. The soundtrack overall was pretty ok to me, nothing really stood out. Nothing really was bad either so it was fine. Side note: I preferred the OP over the ED this time around.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
Pretty much the same characters as the first season with like 1 or 2 more characters introduced. Nothing special here, same jokes from each characters, not really anymore characters development with the reoccurring characters. This isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing though, they&#039;re still charismatic and funny as ever.  And the character development with the new characters was just whatever to me. Didn&#039;t really care too much for it. But that&#039;s just me.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8.5-9<br />
Overall enjoyment was pretty good, a little less than the first season though. Some of the same jokes got old to me and sometimes they were trying a little too hard (rarely though, to me). One of the main reasons i enjoyed it a little less was because of the lack of completeness and weird pacing at times. Towards the ending of the show it was revealed that a strong enemy needed to be defeated but then that gets swept underneath the rug as if it was never made apparent that that person is a threat.  They just end it on that person being sorta friendly to their mortal enemy. Which as ok at first, but then I realized that the show just left it at that. No epic yet funny battle and no more info about the opposing forces. This was so noticeable that I couldn&#039;t just ignore and be like &quot;well the series wasn&#039;t meant to be serious anyways&quot;. Since that&#039;s sometimes people&#039;s arguments towards this. Another thing was the pacing, I can&#039;t fully explain what I mean by this but, sometimes the show took a turn to focus on one thing when another thing needed more focus. There&#039;s more to this but I can&#039;t really articulate it well. Also, the show got way more predictable to me this season which wasn&#039;t too much of a problem but still needs to be stated. Despite this, the show is still pretty enjoyable overall. The characters are always up to shenanigans and this make for some hilarious scenarios. Especially the maid cafe and the moment when Ayumu was dancing with his teacher XD.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
If you enjoyed the first season you&#039;ll definitely enjoy this season as well. There are a few more noticeable quirks with this season than the last one though, such as: jokes sometimes getting stale, unresolved situations, weird pacing, characters getting no more development, and moments getting way too predictable. This is just to remind you though, this show isn&#039;t meant to be taken too seriously. So even though there are problems, it&#039;s meant to give you a laugh, Not too dissect every scene for problems. And again, even though there are problems I found myself dying of laughter at times, as I did with the previous season. So if you want more laughs, then definitely watch this season, but be wary of the problems it has.

    I&#039;m going to come right out and say it, if you want a good plot, I&#039;d look elsewhere, Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? of the Dead is a continuation from where the first series Kore wa Zombie Desu ka left off. However the overaching plot of the origonal was wrapped up in that series and sadly very little was added to repalce it.<br />
<br />
That is not to say Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? of the Dead is completely without plot, it is there and towards the end we even see some hints of something being put into motion however nothing is resolved in any satisying manner

          <span style="display: none;" id="review70447">
        and really the plot feels, to me, hollow and token.<br />
<br />
Plot aside, however, there is a lot about this show to praise; personally I did not really enjoy to OP or ED but that&#039;s quite subjective but other than that I don&#039;t feel the sound failed in any major respect, EU&#039;s many, many, voice actors all suit her well and the character&#039;s voices remain consistant between series so if you liked them in series 1 there&#039;s a good chance you&#039;ll enjoy them jsut as much, or little, in season 2.<br />
<br />
Now we finally get to the heart and soul of this anime; the characters and humour. Both of which return in fine form, the humour benefits from the rather feeble plot and I will certainly admit Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? of the Dead had me laughing at least once in every episode, it&#039;s abusrd, over the top, and will often leave you wondering exactly what you just watched but it is a laugh.<br />
<br />
The characters likewise are this anime&#039;s strength, I liked most of them for one reason or another, being a sucker for moe this series definately delivered in spades on that front, delusions of Eu being as wonderful as they had been in the first series. Character interactions and developments of relationships are what drive this series where the plot had done in the first and for the most part relationships are, within the bounds of this surreal show, realistic and beleiveable and people stay in character.<br />
<br />
In summary; if you&#039;re looking for something sweet and funny then I can reccomend this one thsoe backs however if you&#039;re expecting a plot, or large numbers of action scenes, it&#039;s probably best to pass this anime over for something else. If you&#039;re unsure try watching an episode or two and you should get an idea of if the characters will appeal to you. Finally, though there is a distinct lack of plot they do not go over the events of the first series so you may find yourself lost if you have not watched Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? first, it is, very much, a sequal.

    &quot;Death Is A Natural Part Of Life&quot; a wise and creepy looking creation of George Lucas once said. However there&#039;s nothing natural about this series. Kore Wa Zombie Desuka Of The Dead, one of my most anticipated animes of 2012, did it hold up to the anticipation though? Well, here are my opinions on it:<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the story, there isn&#039;t much of it. I&#039;m sorry but more than half of the anime consist of episodes that go on with little to no plot at all. Most of it really is just Ayumu going through the hell that life seems to love dropping on him.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review66731">
        Constant humiliation in public and and extreme abuse from his.....&quot;friends&quot;...if it&#039;s safe to call them that. The comedy is similar to what we had in the first season, in ways I think it improved since it has it more than just sex jokes or Ayumu just getting brutalized in a funny way, but as much as the comedy &quot;leveled up&quot;, it feels like they traded story for it. Like as if they purposely decided to have mindless episodes to make things funnier. Now, for those of you worried about continuation, not to worry, several things like a few characters from season one return, as the OP will prove in just a few moments of watching the show. Now, without plot for most of the show, can this still be worth a watch? Yes actually, the humor&#039;s very clever whether it&#039;s a pop culture reference or even a reference to another anime. But if you absolutely need a story, then you&#039;ll only really get one at the last few episodes.<br />
<br />
Now for the art, well, if you didn&#039;t have a problem with it during season one, then hopefully you&#039;ll be okay with it staying the exact same. If it isn&#039;t broken, don&#039;t fix it, right? Though, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s just me but the characters seem to have better animated movement as can be told from dance scenes and such, so I guess it has improved in some areas from last year.<br />
<br />
Now for the sound, it has a bit of the same problem as season one had, mainly having not too many memorable songs aside from the catchy as hell OP and ED. As far as the actual OST goes, there aren&#039;t too many songs that I could see many listening to during their free time.<br />
<br />
Character development has become a strong point of this anime. Each character has their own respective personality, however, some characters just didn&#039;t seem to develop much from last season. Such as Haruna and Seraphim, both characters are almost the exact same abusive characters they were in season one, the only difference they have from last season is that they slightly have more respect for Ayumu, but that doesn&#039;t give the poor guy a break as he IS still constantly beaten to the point where he would be dead if he was still human. However, there are some characters that have gotten more development, like Saras and Dai. Not to mention even characters who are new but still manage to be hilariously interesting, I won&#039;t mention them for spoiler&#039;s sake, but I will hint one of them that I&#039;ve especially taken a liking to, all I&#039;m going to say is....&quot;Rainbow Vomit&quot;....<br />
<br />
The verdict for Kore Wa Zombie Desuka Of The Dead is, it&#039;s a good comedy anime but most of the episodes felt like they should have went straight to the mindless OVA. Also, trust me when I say by the end of the anime, alot of things will feel unaccomplished due to how long it took to finally getting to the main story. So in all, this anime IS worth your time if you loved the first season&#039;s comedy, but if you watch it for the plot, then you&#039;ll have a hard time surviving before the last three or so episodes.<br />
Final Score:7.0<br />
<br />
Pros-Good Humor, well animated, good character development for previously minor ones, OP and ED are always a pleasure to watch and listen, and for you perverts out there...fanservice isn&#039;t exactly something this anime has a shortage of.<br />
<br />
Cons-Took too long to finally get to the plot, still has a mostly bland OST, and the main cast didn&#039;t seem to develop much from the last season, and it didn&#039;t really improve from season one with anything else aside from humor.<br />
<br />

    You know, the phrase &quot;anime is weird&quot; has been a frequent idea for many people, anime watchers, and non-anime watchers.  While there are many anime that make this idea false by showing that anime is an entertainment medium that can provide both a proper story and proper character development, there are others, that bolster the idea rather well.  For example, Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?  of the Dead.  The second season of the series.  <br />
<br />
Story (6.31/10):  The story of the Kore wa Zombie is well...complicated.  After being revived after his unfortunate demise, Aikawa Ayumu becomes a zombie thanks

          <span style="display: none;" id="review154951">
        to Eucliwood Hellscythe, a silent necromancer from the underworld, he becomes very active in finding out who is the one that ended his life.  For the first season, that becomes the series&#039;s &quot;main&quot; plot.  For the second season, well, there&#039;s not really very much of a plot.<br />
<br />
Kore wa zombie is a series that is a whole lot of something, with a whole lot of nothing.  To be more exact, the series tries to accomplish a lot while at the same time, really accomplishing nothing.  The story of the series essentially boils down to a bunch of random side stories trying to create a cohesive overarching plot.  While side stories aren&#039;t necessarily a bad thing in anime, as they can create some rather interesting and funny sows to watch, trying to create a good story out of side stories that pose little to no relation to each other is a rather bad idea for a plot idea.  It&#039;s because of this that the story suffers a huge downfall, as the confusion over what you should pay attention to, and what you can dismiss as an act of fanservice or something that serves little to no importance to the story is quite ambiguous and hard to find.  <br />
<br />
Another thing the series fails to do is proper pacing.  The series as a whole has many scenes and plot points that feels quite rushed and above all, unexplained.  Since the series I felt was trying to create something of a plot in certain aspects of it, many of its &quot;story&quot; elements felt very incomplete and open ended, leaving me a show that I felt could&#039;ve done without it.<br />
<br />
Now I know that this show is a fluff show.  It wasn&#039;t trying to have a plot, rather, trying to establish its own set of gags and memorable moments, and things that would make the show unique apart from anything else.  And for that, it succeeded very well.  But, I can&#039;t stop thinking on how the show tried to create something that resembled a plot towards the end, which for me, was something bad that the show did.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Good fluff show<br />
+  Unique and interesting gags.  <br />
-   Attempted to create an &quot;overarching plot&quot;<br />
<br />
Characters (7.68/10):  While the story of the show was less than average, the characters of the series certainly make it up tenfold.  <br />
<br />
Aikawa Ayumu.  As the main protagonist of the series, Ayumu is more or less the least interesting character in the entire cast of characters, who, for some reason, has a harem of girls following him around wherever he goes.  More or less your generic main protagonist that is nice to everyone he meets, the only real defining characteristic I can find from him is the fact that he is a zombie.  Aside from that, there&#039;s nothing really extraordinary that I can find in his character.  <br />
<br />
As for the rest of the cast, the majority of them come back as returning cast, with a few extra additions that come to create a supporting role.  For the most part, the rest of the main cast features Seraphim, Eucliwood, and Haruna, a vampire ninja, a necromancer, and a masou shoujo respectively.  While their titles are quite intriguing, their personalities are even more so.  Each one of them has quite a memorable personality that each makes them interesting in their own right.  While the story lacked in any real substance to leave a lasting impression, the characters certainly made up for that.  <br />
<br />
As for side characters, we have a few interesting new additions to the cast.  While many of them return with little to no change in their personality, the new ones also leave their own mark in the series that in the end, adds to the show.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Great, memorable characters<br />
+  Little to no change for characters<br />
+  Good supporting cast<br />
<br />
Art and Sound (7.68/10 and 7.01/10): The art of the series is a rather nice touch that adds to the show.  The show has a very distinct, somewhat moe look to it that utilizes a very bright color gradient.  It adds to the show&#039;s overall feel of it by giving it a rather bright sort of feel, whilst doing a rather dark feel by giving it a darker background in the more &quot;serious&quot; parts of the show.  Overall, the art compliments the show well, but it still does have its jarring animation moments that can leave a lasting impression due to how different they are compared to the normal animation.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack of the series is an interesting group of tunes.  While I personally feel that both the opening and ending song of the show has a very unique and interesting sound to it, they never felt like really memorable tracks as they didn&#039;t have that certain sound or part to the song that stood out.  While yes, they were tracks that had a unique tone to it, they weren&#039;t songs that I felt were worth listening to over and over again like other anime tracks.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Good looking character designs<br />
+  Bright, colorful characters<br />
+/-  Unmemorable music<br />
<br />
Personal enjoyment (6.41/10):  Fluff shows are a medium of anime that I for the most part, enjoy very much.  They don&#039;t require much thinking to watch, and there are very simple plots in which really anyone can follow.  Kore wa zombie compared to other fluff shows, gave me a little bit more to think about.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I didn&#039;t particularly enjoy this show.  While there were things in the show that I oddly found funny and laughed at, (such as the crossdressing), I never really liked the show.  (It&#039;s one of those unexplainable dislikes.)  On a more technical side of the show, the show fails to focus purely on a main overarching plot or a bunch of side stories, which I felt was really one of the shows major downfalls.  The characters on the other hand were delightfully enjoyable and the art was rather nice looking.  <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a fan of fluff shows and...odd and unique gags, this show is certainly a watch that I would recommend watching.  While I personally didn&#039;t like this show, it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean it&#039;s bad, as there may be parts about the show that you may like.  (For me, it&#039;s the previews at the end of each episode featuring the imaginary Eu&#039;s with original Eu.)<br />
<br />
Overall Score: (7.22/10)

    The second season of Zombie was less than that of the first. It was interesting and still funny.<br />
The story itself seemed to...lack a plot. It gets a 6. It looked like it could have some potential but then suddenly switched up around the end. It re-introduces the characters and their relation to the Hero (and in some cases the Heroins) and introduces some new characters, some....honestly don&#039;t need to be there. They still fight monsters to a point but it kinda focuses on their lives. It was rushed to get some stuff finished but left other things unexplained.<br />
The art and sound were basically like the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review79506">
        first season with the exception of the opening and ending songs and get 6&#039;s. They were really good. Up-beat, and the art for them fit. The ending is adorable and cute, with entertaining side comments from one of the heroins, Eu. So KAWAII^^ <br />
Characters get a 7 since their cuteness and some hotness remained, possibly even increased. three new characters were kind of introduced, only two seemed to have any significant to the show, the last one just threw up blood- can you say resembles other vomiting anime characters much? Eu gets to speak more and we see her other cutie sides at each ending. The girls still love Ayumu, and well we get to see some &quot;bad boy&quot; sides to him. Not a lot of transformations this season but just enough. we get one character back, but only for awhile. Over all the development for characters just continues from the first season.<br />
Enjoyment Overall- both 6&#039;s and it was entertaining, laughable. Nothing too note-worthy but watchable if one&#039;s in the mood to watch a non-traditional zombie anime with hot girls and magic....and hot girls..makes you wonder- Is This /really/ A Zombie?

    KoreZom is back, and it could actually get even better than its previous season. Obviously that I&#039;m talking in plot terms, since its essence remained just the same: make you lose your breath from laughing!<br />
<br />
{STORY - 7/10}<br />
<br />
Ayumu returns as a zombie and masou-shoujo, but, if meeting a lot of weird people got him into tons of trouble, dealing with an unexpected event, that suddenly turns his school life upside down, will be a true challenge.<br />
<br />
An unknown drunken being joins our main character on this new journey to assist Ayumu onto understanding the reason of living and seeing the bright side upon being accused of sick

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136655">
        crossdressing and becoming an world known fever.<br />
<br />
This newly developed plot surpasses the first one, as it gets better and better on every new episode. A little bit from its climax unfolds slowly, until it reaches the edge and give us an worthy ending, eventhough there&#039;s a whole more to be shown.<br />
<br />
{ART - 9/10}<br />
<br />
Once again, I got the pleasure if being amazed with such artwork, that may be the best I ever saw on a shounen manga based anime. Tough it remained pretty much the same, a new and even more exciting opening sequence was made to introduced the brand new season, while an ending directed towards romance was featured this time, contrasting with the ridiculously funny one we knew from before.<br />
Also, you can expect a whole new bunch of faces coming from Ayumu!<br />
<br />
{SOUND - 10/10}<br />
<br />
Most of its backgrounding still focused on the three top instrumental songs from the series: calm, transformation and thrilling. Obviously that some other pieces complete the OST and every one of them were still to fit their places without any problem.<br />
<br />
Iori performs &quot;* * * Passionate&quot;, an improved version of the previous intro song, and Rie stands by herself this time during the anime&#039;s credits, mixing the &quot;Koi no Beginner Nan Desu&quot; love song with a very special... &quot;compilation&quot;...<br />
<br />
{CHARACTER - 9/10}<br />
<br />
Briefly introduced characters now come to steal some spotlights and make their bright entrances on this series! You may guess I&#039;m talking about Haruna&#039;s master, Ariel, the emerging idol, Lovely Kirara/Sarasvati and, finally, Mystletainn Sensei, who holds a special surprise for us. Some recurring names were added as well, to enlarge its original cast and further improve this aspect.<br />
<br />
{ENJOYMENT - 10/10}<br />
<br />
It will hook you right on the first episode and those 10 pieces may seem not enough to fully express this amazing work. It ends fast, but doesn&#039;t let you down and adds a desire for more. Only time can tell us when the next chapter from this story will be aired...<br />
<br />
{OVERALL - 9/10}<br />
<br />
Ayumu is had nothing special. Being friends with a pervert and not drawing too much attention during his High School time was something that he wanted. No trouble, just a calm life. Getting to be immortal and sharing his house with uncommon beings for so long made him change... This season is dedicated to Ayumu&#039;s youth, as a deeper reason for him to live will be revealed, under many absurd situations. Gaia will not rest until Ayumu shows what he is really capable of...

    &quot;And the world shudders as two perverts put their heads together&quot;<br />
-- Misc Brown Haired Girl Ep 04<br />
<br />
Sure seems that after the first season the perverts on the team put their heads together and came up with comedy. Between improving the deliver, taking out  the vitriol in the jokes , adding in some really funny characters, and making much better use of supporting characters, the series has improved to the point where it&#039;s making me smile. Still no belly laughs or much more than a chuckle but that sure beats first season.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#039;s something different about you lately&quot;<br />
---Kanami Mihara<br />
<br />
Characters are where the second season gained the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326743">
        most. Adding in Chris as the drunken magical girl, Gave them a character that was just pure comedy gold. The only thing they did wrong with her is there just wasn&#039;t enough of her. Yuki really begins to take on the part of  young girl with the hopeless crush  and plays clueless for all it&#039;s worth. Saravati is now obsessed with Ayuma and regularly stalking him.  Even the chainsaw gets some good lines. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well there&#039;s another thing I wanted to talk to you about&quot;<br />
----Yuki<br />
<br />
That&#039;s the comedy. They are finally starting to get the comedy right. The gore is mostly gone, and the beatdowns of Ayumu are no longer cringewiorthy. Most of the humiliation directed at him is modulated so it&#039;s no longer in the back away slowly while keeping your eyes fixed on the crazy person range. Ayuma is at last acting as a proper straight man , not a pathetic punching bag. Finally they managed to figure out the way to make people laugh at a crossdresser was to really play up the awkwardness and incongruity.  <br />
<br />
&quot;The more things change, the more they stay the same&quot;<br />
---Unknown.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the second season couldn&#039;t shed all the sins of the first season. Zombie is still failing to keep it funny. It&#039;s still falling by going serious at the wrong points<br />
<br />
It&#039;s shame the second season didn&#039;t just do more of what they got right this time around. At least this time around the anime will improve your mood.

    Butt-love and Sequels! It&#039;s been repeatedly stated in cliche manners that sequels will never be as good as the original. In anime, that case has been proven wrong in many cases. But I&#039;m sad to say though, that Kore wa zombie desu ka? Of the Dead! is not one of of those cases.<br />
<br />
Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? Of the Dead! starts off on where we exactly left. They even have an OVA where they&#039;re still at the pool, the place where the first season ended. It was pretty good at first. They even decided to introduce new characters, but after the first 4 or 5

          <span style="display: none;" id="review63567">
        episodes, the whole thing started to go down.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk plot shall we? One of the things I really don&#039;t like is a half-baked plot with poor story and character development. Maybe they were out of budget or something, but honestly, the plot-line and the development was sadly quite poor. This was previously one of the anime that I really liked. Mainly because of their mix of a romantic-esque plot-line, and their hilarious brand of comedy. But in Zombie of the dead!, the totally lucked out. Unlike the first one, this one&#039;s ending seemed a little too off, and very rushed that it made me reach the point where I wanted to actually stop in the middle of it, since you can literally see what happens next. It happened in the last few episodes though, so it still has points.<br />
<br />
It still retains its good points though. They recycled some parts in the first season a few times, but it wasn&#039;t such a big deal. Its comedic properties are still there and still strong though, so no need to worry about that. And the harem is still there. It had even grown into a slightly bigger, and rationally weirder one! So we&#039;re good on those points.<br />
<br />
As far as the art goes, I don&#039;t really have any complaints. It&#039;s pretty much the same as before, with no particular changes. The did add more &quot;hallucination elcuwood&quot; screen time though. And the improved OP was pretty cool. The ED seem recycled though.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is nothing special either. Sure, they have new and improved OPs and EDs. They also decided to use some of the old songs in the first season as background material, which was pretty cool. The also have new insert songs for some parts. But it didn&#039;t really improve, so it&#039;s not really a big deal.<br />
<br />
I guess my main complaint was that the anime didn&#039;t really improve. It might have even gotten worse, perhaps. Sequels are supposed to be chances for more improvement. But I guess it was pretty hard for them to do that. Well, maybe Studio Deen decided to give up on the series. It&#039;s a shame too. Kore wa Zombie Desu Ka? could have been a lot better. It would be pretty good if they&#039;d continue the series though. It has a lot of potential. I&#039;d welcome it with open arms. But they&#039;d better improve parts though, otherwise they would just be wasting the time and money of their viewers.<br />
<br />
But I&#039;m not discouraging you or anything. I guess if you wanted more of our hero, Aikawa&#039;s antics from the first season, then dive right into its sequel. Just don&#039;t raise your expectations too high.

    There are certain things where the plot (or lack thereof) can be positively dreadful, but they can still be enjoyable for other reasons--like the humor, the characters, the artwork...any number of reasons. Something not good can still be fun. <br />
<br />
Such is the case with Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? of the Dead. The second season somewhat picks up where the first left off. Ayumu is still a zombie, still going to high school and still living with the vampire ninja, necromancer, magical girl--and with her powers. Everything is going just peachy until a particularly powerful megalo appears on school grounds, forcing Ayumu to transform into

          <span style="display: none;" id="review63375">
        the pink, frilly magical garment girl of season one...in front of his entire class. Unfortunately, amidst this encounter he taxes Mystletain a little too much leaving him without a memory-wiping out to preserve his reputation. <br />
<br />
With the stage set and the addition of more crazy characters like the drunk &quot;fairy&quot; Ayumu believes to be the embodiment of his stress, and yet another vampire ninja, season two waves the flag of promise for more fun. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, season two would have played through much better had it decided to just go slice-of-life on the audience. Ten episodes aren&#039;t very many, and within that timeframe the show adds another potential &quot;love interest&quot; for Ayumu and a world-threatening villain while trying to continue a character story from last season&#039;s villain. Nothing is resolved and the moments of seriousness are awkwardly transitioned and placed, even moreso than the last season. In fact, halfway through the series the vampire ninja who walks around calling herself Ayumu&#039;s bride is borderline forgotten, as is the newest love interest. The plotline with last season&#039;s villain shows promise, but ends on a weak, watered-down note of &quot;issues.&quot; As for the whole world-threateningly-dangerous villain plotline--which is good up until after its climax!--it is merely given half-hearted nods to when it suits the purpose for other half-hearted plotlines. <br />
<br />
Regardless of the massive amounts of inconsistencies, dropped subplots (or main plots) and rushed--and sometimes random/nonsensical-in-a-bad-way--storytelling, the core characters from the last season remain the characters I know and love. Each week, I looked forward to new episodes even if there wasn&#039;t a plot to really follow. The addition of the drunk &quot;fairy&quot; character was also quite an enjoyable element, I only wish they had her around more. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a fan of the first season for the characters, you will probably enjoy the second season as well to a degree. There is less action, less bloody, twisted humor and, a fortunate point for me, a smidgen less fanservice, something I found to be the biggest frustration of the first season.

    Brief Synopsis<br />
<br />
Kore wa Zombie-desuka? Of The Dead, for all intensive purposes, is a direct sequel of the original series. The story follows Ayumu Aikawa, a high school boy who was turned into a zombie by Eucliwood Hellscythe, a Necromancer from the Underworld. However, that&#039;s not all, he&#039;s also a Masou Shoujo after accidentally stealing the powers from another Masou Shoujo named Haruna. On top of this insanity, Ayumu also befriends a Vampire Ninja named Seraphim, and together, these four live together and battle many different forces of evil.<br />
<br />
In this 2nd Season, Ayumu encounters a new enemy, which appears to be the ultimate villain in this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review63069">
        series thus far...the only problem is he just doesn&#039;t realize the threat this person poses.<br />
<br />
Strengths<br />
<br />
I thought the strongest aspect of this anime was the comedy writing. For an anime that felt like a fairly big filler, it was pretty well written in its comedy regard. While I was a bit impartial to the comedy of the 1st series, I found the 2nd season to be better written. I found myself laughing much harder at the ludicrously ridiculous situations Ayumu got himself in. <br />
<br />
Another strength of this animewas the character development. We learned a lot more about not only the leads, but many of the side characters, such as Kirara, Yuki, Orito, etc. On top of that, an array of new characters were introduced, including a hallucinated Fairy-like character, another soft-spoken harem addition named Taeko, and a former warrior for Eucliwood from the Underworld named Negrelia. Learning more about the side characters, as well as the addition of the new side characters seemed to lighten the overall mood for Zombie-desuka and made it much more humorous.<br />
<br />
As per usual in the Kore wa Zombie-desuka series, the music and voice acting is pretty solid. Especially in the Kirara concert scenes, there are many insert songs that are pretty solid to rock out to and the background music in almost all the scenes fits perfectly, ESPECIALLY in the final episode. The voice acting overall is still very solid and for the many Eucliwood Hellscythe fans from this series, they&#039;ll be glad to know they&#039;ll get to hear a lot more from their favorite...quiet Necromancer.<br />
<br />
Weaknesses<br />
<br />
The obvious weakness of this anime was story progression. It&#039;s difficult to progress an on-going story in a 10-episode run, and on top of that, the 2nd Season didn&#039;t even really try and progress the story very much. Essentially all we learned from the 2nd Season is there is a new enemy, a Masou Shoujo named Chris, who stands in Ayumu&#039;s way. However, her grand scheme was not  clearly revealed and I would more than likely guess it will primarily be revealed in the 3rd Season.<br />
<br />
Another weakness of this anime was pretty much the same argument I had with the 1st Season. It just goes way too far with the fan service. Fan service to me is sort of hit-or-miss in anime. There are times where it is used well and can make a funny situation even funnier...and there are times where it is just thrown in for the simple fact of appeasing a semi-perverted audience. In this...it&#039;s spotty. There are times where it works and times where it just falls flat and is completely unnecessary. <br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
My overall impression of Kore wa Zombie-desuka? Of The Dead? It was okay, and not necessarily a step up or a step down from the original series. Fans of the series are going to get what they expect...more crazy, loony comedy from a mixed troupe of fantasy characters living a frantic, yet semi-normal high school lives. Like I said, I felt the comedy in this anime was much stronger, but the overall storytelling was much weaker. In my own personal opinion, I&#039;ve become more of a fan of this series due to this season because I felt the storytelling was good in the first season and the comedy was lacking. This season, to me, more or less balanced things out. As far as a recommendation, Kore wa Zombie-desuka? Of The Dead is a good watch if you were a fan of the original series and even if you were like me and thought the 1st Season was sort of watered down and bland, this does seem to add a little bit more of a wrinkle that makes it funnier and more interesting. If you weren&#039;t a fan of the 1st Season, it&#039;s not very highly recommended. All this season really adds is a little more depth to the characters, more hilarious side stories, and a setup for a 3rd Season.
