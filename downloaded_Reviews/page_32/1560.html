One thing that&#039;s particularly refreshing is that all the characters, even ones from the magical world, are portrayed in a very realistic manner. Instead of relying on eccentric behavior to drive the story, the show just lets people be themselves. This is particularly important for the character of Chinatsu, a grade-school girl who&#039;s the younger cousin of Makoto (the titular witch of the series). It&#039;s great to see her reactions because she doesn&#039;t act like any of the anime tropes you might expect to encounter, nor is she given any odd quirks to make her more of a stand-out (e.g. Renge from Non Non Biyori). Chinatsu&#039;s just a normal kid, and that alone makes her a rare and wonderful creation. <br />
<br />
Similarly, Chito, Makoto’s cat and familiar, actually acts and is animated like a real cat. Chito can be lazy, likes taunting the neighborhood dog, and goes on inscrutable adventures that only another cat could truly understand. I’ve followed a few cats on their adventures in my time and Chito is exactly like those real world felines. There’s a wonderful moment in Episode 5 when Chito decides to take a nap with Chinatsu, and the animators take the time to depict Chito circling around a few times before finally settling down. This is exactly what every cat ever actually does, and this show has the generosity to let Chito be true to Chito. All anime cats should be so lucky.<br />
<br />
Generosity is perhaps the best word to describe Flying Witch. One can’t help but notice the small kindnesses that every episode contains. Whether it’s helping out with simple household chores, ensuring that a caterpillar finds a safe spot to feed on fresh leaves, or keeping a new friend company while she runs errands, one is constantly reminded of how these tiny actions are often so much more meaningful than the occasional grand gesture. <br />
<br />
Flying Witch is a moment of utter serenity in the frenetic world of anime, and its real magic is in giving its viewers the chance to reflect on the smallest moments in daily life and realize that those can be the most enchanting of all. Flying Witch shows that a butterfly…or a caterpillar…is as beautiful and moving as a cathedral.

    Do you want a show that is serene, tranquil, and perfect for relaxation? Maybe you are tired of how action-packed and over-the-top most anime are? Perhaps you want to relieve yourself of all the worries in real life and just enjoy the ride?<br />
<br />
Regardless, I invite you to enter the world of Flying Witch. It is not heavy, exciting, or full of action. In fact, it meanders through quite uneventful situations. However, it is truly the pinnacle of slice of life as far as feeling good goes. It&#039;s a beautiful concoction of peaceful music, a laid-back setting, and genuinely sweet characters doing everyday things with no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221887">
        worry or tension and magic thrown in. While more demanding audiences may find it dull, I can safely recommend it those who just want something sweet and soothing.<br />
<br />
There are other relaxing shows out there, like Non Non Biyori, K-On!, and the Suzumiya Haruhi Series to name a few, but not very many of them can create such a perfectly built universe that seems separate and devoid of anime clichés and stereotypes. It is merely a tale of a girl named Makoto visiting her family in the outskirts with her cat. However, their daily activities aren&#039;t very ordinary. In fact, they regularly involve magic. Think of it like Aria or Yokohama Shopping Log with fantasy flavor. Makoto herself is a witch and their everyday events include anything from planting a mandrake to helping a friend turn back into a human from a furry to visiting a Ghibli-esque café with regular customers that include ladybugs, foxes, and invisible people. The magical elements blend in so seamlessly, it&#039;s as if they&#039;re natural. It adds a level of extra beauty to an otherwise run of the mill story.<br />
<br />
The cast of characters are very memorable. They all have stunning chemistry together and their conversations flow with ease. Each of them also have many personality traits that adds a level of familiarity that most SoL anime don&#039;t have. While I was watching it, I didn&#039;t feel like I was just watching characters talking with each other. I felt like they were genuine people that I knew closely. Don&#039;t expect them to be well-developed or complex though.<br />
<br />
Now I come to the big issue - Unfortunately, not everyone will appreciate Flying Witch. Regardless of how cute and cuddly it is, a large portion of the audience will find it boring. There is no overall plot, no drama, no conflict, no character development, and no degree of complexity. Those who want something exciting, thrilling or deep won&#039;t get what they&#039;re looking for. I had to be in an undemanding mood to enjoy it to the fullest, so I found myself bored while watching it some days.<br />
<br />
The production was done by the masters of slice of life themselves, J.C.Staff. Like all their shows, the animation is rather standard. It doesn&#039;t look choppy or ugly but certainly doesn&#039;t boast anything special. The designs are very typical but don&#039;t stick out as terrible or anything. I can say the visuals fit the calm style of the narrative but only that much.<br />
<br />
As for the music, it does a good job of being soothing and restful but like the visuals, it&#039;s not fantastic. Most of the soundtrack is composed of calm piano and flute pieces, as well as some stringed music. None of the tracks in particular are very memorable but as a whole, it does its job. The opening, on the other hand, can be described in one word - Cute. With the adorable dance routine, upbeat song, and colorful visuals, you can&#039;t help but feel warm inside after watching it. It does a very good job of preparing for what&#039;s to come. There is also something special about the voice acting. Quite simply, the VAs sound genuine. None of them deliver squeaky or overly obnoxious roles (unlike a good portion of slice of life), so it sounds very nice.<br />
<br />
So, sit back, relax, drink a cup of tea, sit on your couch, and enjoy the ride. Are you having a bad day? It will be a great remedy for that. In the end, what you have is definitely a basic slice of life type of show - but one of the best ones out there. Even if you&#039;re a cold-hearted bastard and spawn of Cthulu, you should still get something out of it.

    Flying Witch, a show that pretty much speaks for itself judging by the title. Yes, it’s literally a series about a flying witch named Makoto and her friends. Yes, it has magic in the series because what else would witches excel in? And yes, this is the type of magical story that will entice you in such a comfortable charm that you won’t ever forget.<br />
<br />
The series is adapted from the manga of the same name and essentially, it’s a hybrid of slice of life and fantasy. We follow the life of Kowata Makoto as she returns to living in a rural town with her friends

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222392">
        and relatives. In essence, it explores the daily life style of how Makoto gets around while also developing her magical skills as the flying witch. Her friends and family guides her while we also learn about their characters. There is no linear storytelling as each episode seems to be an episodic adventure of itself. However, that’s what actually makes Flying Witch so special because just how unique the show can be as we see its imaginativity.<br />
<br />
A good deal of the enjoyment about the series comes from the characters. It’s a small yet diverse and unique cast because every character has their own attributes and characteristics. Makoto is the polite type of girl with a down to earth type of personality yet also has a problem of getting lost. Throughout the series, this humorous gag is played as we see how clueless she can be with directions. Then, there’s Chinatsu Kuramoto (Makoto’s cousin). As a younger character, it comes to no surprise that she is curious about the world around her and the people she meets. Furthermore, she has a peculiar interest in magic after seeing it with her very own eyes. It’s also interesting to note that Chinatsu gets a decent amount of development as she experiences with magic as well. Akane Kowata is the witch of the series, literally. She is not just the older sister of Makoto but also acts as her mentor figure as well. However, unlike Makoto, Akane is more of an airhead and often speaks what’s on her mind no matter how brutally honest it is. Despite that, she deeply cares about her family and we can see that she has a gentle heart. From Chinatsu’s family side, we also have Kei Kuramoto who serves more of the older brother type. Although by personality, I find that he is more similar to Akane with his down to earth personality. It’s these characters that gets a good deal of emphasis and each episode explores their relationship in the story. And to be quite honest, it’s quite special.<br />
<br />
So yes, you’re probably asking yourself: what should I really expect from Flying Witch? Do we just get to see a typical slice of life/fantasy story that we may or may not like? While the pacing of the series may feel sluggish, it’s the atmospheric feel and ways to embrace the fantasy genre that really can win fans over. Throughout the show, there’s all type of supernatural gags that makes their appearances ranging from sonic screeching mandrakes, flying whales, mysterious ghosts, and even anthropomorphic characters that can transform into a dog. Familiars such as cats and hamsters are also no stranger in this series either. The point is that the series wants the viewers to experience what it has to offer by bringing all sorts of content to the table. It succeeds in this by bringing a sense of magical realism by combining elements of supernatural with daily life experiences. <br />
<br />
From a story perspective, the series can stray some viewers from pursuing further into the series as at times, the pacing can feel uninteresting. If you’re dying for some magical action, then you’re looking at wrong place. This isn’t some series about witches trying to take over the world. In fact, Flying Witch emphasizes a lot about its premise and themes rather than story development. I confess to myself that the series is perhaps one of the most charming shows I’ve watched in recent years. Just for the fact that each episode, there’s the graceful feeling the series brings in with its character and setting. Even the comedy, which I wasn’t sold on at first, convinced me that the series is a rare gem. It’s down to earth humor that is very consistent about what it tries to do. In the meantime, I’m also satisfied with the directing of the series despite that it follows more of a rearranged adaptation.<br />
<br />
J.C. Staff helms the series and it’s quite an elegant feeling you’ll see with its artwork. Characters look simple yet makes you wonder what to expect about them. There’s a refreshing feel whenever you see characters like Makoto on a broomstick or Chinatsu with witch aesthetics on. The familiars are also convincing that blurs the line between magical realism. Even the setting of a rural town is crafted quite well with a countryside feel that is nostalgic.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack and music plays an important part of the series as it brings the atmospheric feeling to life. The overall tone of the show has a gentle tone and is wonderfully put together with its soft instruments. Both the OP and ED theme songs are also lighthearted and reminds us how charming the series can be. Furthermore, I have to give praise for the overall voice mannerism of the series as they sound exactly as their personalities is reflected.<br />
<br />
Ah Flying Witch. Dubbed by some fans as “Comfy”, it’s definitely a show that is recommendable to just about anyone. From the unique cast of characters to magical realism, it’s a series that takes slice of life and fantasy to a creative level. What you expect is what you will get. And that is, a show about flying witches, familiars, and giving you a comfy time. <br />

    The title &quot;Flying witch&quot; suggests there will be flying and magics. I think both happen maybe once in each episode and that&#039;s it. But it&#039;s not a bad thing, it&#039;s just regular &#039;slice of life&#039; anime.<br />
<br />
Story follows young witch Makoto living with her relatives in some nice countryside. The vibe really reminds me of &quot;Non non biyori&quot; - almost no people in the background, just main characters doing everyday things. Well, sometimes &#039;everyday things for a witch&#039;, but it&#039;s not flashy fireworks show. I really liked that, the magic rituals shown are simple - no lights, no wind, mainly drawing magic circles, using small items

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222013">
        and awaiting effect. Flying on a broom is a way to travel around town, no racing or great speeds, just floating short distances.<br />
<br />
You&#039;ve seen these characters before - 7/10<br />
Unfortunately nothing great in terms of characters, but they work nicely in this enviroment.<br />
<br />
Some nice ideas - 9/10<br />
The witches are among us, and so are some interesting ideas about how they live, and what other magical things there are in the world.<br />
<br />
Sound - 7/10<br />
The opening is great, you will clap along in no time. Soundtrack not so much unfortunately, but it provides the relaxing atmosphere.<br />
<br />
Nichijou - 7/10<br />
Nothing special in terms of story, but I enjoyed short episodes from life of a witch. Familiar situations with just a little bit more magic.<br />
<br />
Non Non Witch - 10/10<br />
For me that was really more of a simple life in the countryside, relaxing atmosphere and no real problems.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for something peaceful to watch this season.<br />

    Sha, la,la,laaa, dakedo, exactly what directions does this anime going for????????That&#039;s the question which only writer Chihiro Ishizuka and anime director Katsushi Sakurabi can answer, as I watch the last episode of this anime, and all I can say is that it was pretty fucking boring to say the least:<br />
<br />
Storywise, it has a setting and a genre, but it&#039;s plot about a witch in training was pretty much an complicated form of Parachronism, where one wouldn&#039;t understand as to why would a witch in training even live with a family who doesn&#039;t even practice witchcraft, let alone that such entity is an abomination to ever

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221949">
        religious faith be it Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam, would be in a community who somehow doesn&#039;t mind that there is one in their neighborhood. Also the plot is all over the place for an anime with a slice of life genre, it may have a comedy genre, but it wasn&#039;t even funny, so poor Flying witch has landed a 3 over 10 on my score card.<br />
<br />
Artwise, it was a plain as any anime without an ecchi genre, so it&#039;s a 5 over 10, don&#039;t expect any panchira, onsen fanservice nor a swimsuit fanservice.<br />
<br />
Sound, a  7 over 10 since the only consolation here was the opening theme, Sha, la,la, laaa.........it has that sweet feeling to it and it fits that main character as well.<br />
<br />
Character, it&#039;s a 5 over 10 for this category, since the character themselves were plain and boring as they can be.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment, since there isn&#039;t any scantly in this anime, it as decent as it can be, so 4 over 10..........<br />
<br />
But overall , I&#039;m giving it a 3 since you&#039;re more likely to wonder as to why would they even make an anime this boring, than enjoy the show. OUT<br />

    Take it easy, relax, and join in the fun. Flying witch&#039;s is perhaps one of the best titles to get snuggle up and &quot;comfy&quot; with.<br />
<br />
Flying witch was indeed a &quot;comfy&quot; title. Without a doubt &quot;comfy&quot; is the best word to describe the series. Flying Witch is a fantasy title that follows the 15-year-old witch Makoto Kowata and other supporting characters in her daily life.  Because the show is considered &quot;Slice of Life&quot; the story and plot are slow. The  slow pacing of the story-telling is actually a good thing, it makes it easy to follow along, and in addition to that, you can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221891">
        enjoy what the story has to offer, which is one of the many things I appreciated about this title. What&#039;s fascinating about Flying witch is that the show has a distinct Studio Ghibli feel to it. Ghibli films were always full of imaginative worlds, full of wonder and exploration. More than likely you will read this in many other reviews, with that out the way, let&#039;s continue. Flying witch is the &quot;ideal&quot; example  of a show with the following genres&#039; &quot;supernatural&quot; and  &quot;slice of life&quot; done right.  The original author Chihiro Ishizuka must have had extensive knowledge and a lengthy amount of experience working on supernatural and slice of life titles. Because none of her work is listed anywhere, I&#039;m going to assume that she has worked on various titles in the past and went unaccredited. If this is truly her first work then I must say that the way the anime was able to portray her work was very well done. The show offers quite a lot of lighthearted comedy which is backed up with little things like odd reaction faces (which I always found hilarious,) silly little jokes and gestures, that sort of thing. More than likely you won&#039;t be laughing your ass off to much. As for the lasting appeal the story has to offer, I feel like the show didn&#039;t really stand out that. This is perhaps due to the releases of bigger titles like Kabeneri of the Iron Fortess, Re:, and Boku no Hero Academia. When you read the Synopsis of Flying witch, in comparison to the mainstream titles listed above I&#039;d say more viewers would watch those of witch. Last few things I&#039;m going to add is that Flying witch&#039;s story, while not as deep as I expected, does in fact have moments that tug at the heart-strings at bit. It&#039;s so well part together that I may or may not have had tears in my eyes... <br />
<br />
Flying witch delivered visually spectacular animation! Settings, objects, all boated very high quality animation that was both frequently &amp; heavily used during various scenes. The beauty of the background settings, water, trees, grass plains, the quality was beautiful! I could see that the animators added a few CGI objects &amp; textures to add a sense of realism to certain things, again, like water, clouds, and ground objects etc. Seeing the reflection of objects in the water, the rough detail added in the stone,simply brilliant. Yasuhiro Okumura and Yoshio okouchi went all out, in details of the objects like wooden floors, tables etc.  Character designs were pretty amazing too. I loved the silly reaction faces the Characters would make. This coupled along with the moods shown on their faces . J.C.Staff really outdid themselves when it came to adding details and such to characters faces and body movement. Expressing the way a characters facial features, body movement, and emotions when they  would react to supernatural moments had a somewhat overly dramatic, yet was almost human-like. I do not doubt that J.C. Staff brought in real people (most likely workers there) and used Motion capture suits to add more realism in the already majestic &amp; magical fantasy world that is Flying Witch. Perhaps the only thing that bothered me is the reflection spots on the characters noses, just that little odd spot. With very little doubt, I can say proudly that Flying Witch had &quot;the best&quot; animation I&#039;ve seen so far this Spring season. Outstanding job done by J.C. Staff!<br />
<br />
I love the intro song, it really gets me excited to watch the show and singing &amp; start clapping along with the song like a mentally disturbed man-child.  Every episode I would deliberately forget to skip the intro to sing along, as if I was a child watching Barney, or sesame street, or whatever children&#039;s programming is on now-a-days, damn if I know. The way that the intro song is performed reminds me of a late 90&#039;s and early 2000&#039;s catchy anime opening. To be more specific it kind of reminds me of Azumanga Daioh&#039;s intro, remember? Lu La lu La piano wa sekai no yumesaku nohara ni melody... Ready to sing along and then get right into the show and have a blast watching. The background music played in Flying witch was fantastic too. It&#039;s sort of like music played to fit with whatever is going on at the moment. That music really enhanced the quality of scenes full of magic, and certain parts in the show where the girls were taking part in some sort of adventure. Ghibli comes to mind again because as I mentioned earlier just about every song in a majority of the films has a beautiful and relaxing musical score that helps intesfies viewers expiernce while watching their films. Flying Witch shares that simular trait. Voice actors were perhaps my favorite thing in the sound department. Second favorite, because you know, the opening song is #1. I think that the voice actors did a magnificent job delivering their lines along with perfectly executing the over the top reaction lines/responses. Each character had their own distinctive, unique, &amp;  charming qualities to them. This makes the show both friendly and appealing to whomever decides to watch it. It&#039;s actually rather difficult for me to add anything of usefulness to the characters because I feel like my character section would turn out to be very opinionated. So with that, Let me add that the cast is memorable, their interactions with each other is always fun to watch. <br />
<br />
I cannot think of one thing I didn&#039;t enjoy about Flying witch. The comedy, jokes though light was often times funny and kept me going through the story. The plot  for different episodes always had something of interest and charm to deliver. Enough though I didn&#039;t feel like it had enough &quot;magic&quot; for a supernatural title, I was still impressed with everything that was presented in the end. I enjoyed getting time to discover new things with the main characters. Speaking of characters each of the main cast had  left me with good impressions of them. Expect for Kei.. he was boring as a character. Makoto, Akane Nao, MamaKuramoto and Chinatsu were the characters I enjoyed seeing the most in this series. Each of them had both fun and loving aspects to their own unique personalities which made the show all the more enjoyable for me. If I had to choose what was my favorite thing about flying witch was, I would probably say all of it. The show was so well written, displayed beautiful settings, and had the best music composed to complement that scenery. All of it, all of it put together made for a really amazing title! <br />
<br />
The only thing that stopped me from giving Flying Witch a 10/10 was that it lacks replay value. This is the type of title that I would probably own, but not open, nor watch. It would site in my Blu-Ray pile until I remembered that I bought it, despite loving it so much at the time. While most would consider this a polished diamond, I would consider it a hidden gem. It&#039;s only great if find it for yourselves that way you&#039;re not influenced by others (myself included) opinions about the show.  It makes the experiences of watching Flying Witch all the more valuable.  I had a really pleasant time watching this show  and I would highly recommend it to anyone who can handle slow-paced slice of life titles.

    Flying Witch Review (NO SPOILERS)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Heh. No spoilers. As if this show actually has anything to spoil, in the first place. Ok, then. Flying Witch is one of those shows that I see a screenshot or a short clip of and I think the artwork looks so stinkin good, that I just gotta go see the entire show. And unfortunately... that doesn&#039;t always lead me to the best of shows... If I were to describe Flying Witch in one word, it would be &quot;nothing&quot;. That&#039;s the gist of it. NOTHING happens in this show. So you&#039;re thinking &quot;Oh, then it&#039;s a slice of life show?&quot; I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review227051">
        guess??? But it&#039;s the most eventless and dull lifestyle that you&#039;ll ever witness. Now, I said that there isn&#039;t anything to spoil in this show, and there really isn&#039;t. But I will be going over some events in the show, as well as the overall beginning set up, just so I can better describe things. Don&#039;t worry, though. I swear that you won&#039;t be getting spoiled on anything groundbreaking, no matter how much detail I give you.<br />
<br />
So as the name of the show implies, this show stars a witch, named Makoto. Now you may be thinking &quot;Ok, a witch. So there&#039;s probably some cool magic and otherworldly events in this show, right?&quot; Nope... Well... there is, but it&#039;s almost entirely non existent. What I mean is that a lot of the magic in Flying witch is either done through reciting words, writing a spell or drawing a symbol, or through jump cuts that have NO flashy transition that even acknowledges that something magic even happened. For example, there&#039;s this cafe in the show, run by a witch. But the cafe looks like an abandoned, destroyed building. What they gotta do is a series of gestures, to make the cafe&#039;s true appearance show itself. You see them looking at the destroyed building, cut to their faces and bodies, doing the gestures, and then cut to the building being completely different. No transition. No sound effects. Nothing. Another thing is the flying. Makoto doesn&#039;t entirely know how to fly, at the beginning of the show. That gets mentioned around episode 4 or 5, or something like that. So you&#039;d think we&#039;d watch her trying to learn how to fly. But no. On the second to last episode or so, there&#039;s a scene that has Makoto flying on her broom. One of the characters mentions how well she&#039;s flying. And she just says &quot;Oh, ya. I finally mastered it.&quot; And that&#039;s it. It&#039;s never brought up, again. There&#039;s even a part where a non witch character starts training to become a witch. She asks for her parent&#039;s permission and they just say yes, with no hesitation. And then that&#039;s it. She never gets any magic powers throughout the show, but she&#039;s apparently now in training to become a witch. And that&#039;s the end of that.<br />
<br />
So if you&#039;re watching this show for its magic elements, don&#039;t. They&#039;re the most nonexistent non extravagant magic elements you ever see, or rather not see, in any anime ever. So how about the slice of life aspect of the show? Is that any good? Well... not really. It doesn&#039;t have any sort of plot, in any of the episodes. Not even any episodic ones, like Ouran Host Club or Fruits Basket. And it isn&#039;t funny in the slightest, like Azumanga Daioh. This show is all about existence. Just straight up existence, in the blandest way possible. There&#039;s about .0001% of magic, thrown into the mix of it, but that&#039;s all. Now a show about simple existence isn&#039;t always a bad thing, when the characters are at least interesting to watch. So... are these characters interesting to watch? Take a guess... Just like how the show can be described as &quot;nothing&quot;, all of the characters can be described as &quot;nobody&quot;. Not a single one of them has a personality. At all. I could not describe these characters, if my life depended on it. I even went and looked up the character descriptions for everyone on MyAnimeList, and even THEY can&#039;t describe these characters in more than 1 or 2 sentences. Probably my favorite description was for one of the main characters, Chinatsu. Her description is &quot;Younger sister of Kei. She dislikes bake because she thinks it&#039;s for adults.&quot; That about sums it all up, right there.<br />
<br />
The characters are all nice people. That&#039;s about as much as I can say to describe them. Nice. They&#039;re always nice to each other. There isn&#039;t a single bit of conflict in the entire show. I could probably count on one hand, all of the sentences in all of the dialogue of the entire show that had even the slightest bit of conflict in them. There&#039;s literally nothing else to say about it. There&#039;s no conflict. No problem solving. No plot twists. No nothing. This is a show about nothing, starring a bunch of nobodies. As for the music, it&#039;s just as bland and nonexistent as the show, so at least it flows well with the show it&#039;s attached to. Still, you won&#039;t remember any of the songs in this show. Not even the opening or ending. The opening and ending are generic in both sound and visuals. Completely skippable. There&#039;s no english dub as of right now, so you&#039;re only option is sub. The voice acting is fine. No problems with it, at least. Though, if there ever is a dub, you may think this is a good show to have play in the background, while you do something else. Though, personally, I think it&#039;d be better to leave the visuals in the background, and don&#039;t even worry about listening to what&#039;s going on.<br />
<br />
The animation is probably the best thing in the entire show. That&#039;s the whole reason I decided to watch this show, in the first place. The animation was done by J.C. Staff, a company that has worked on MANY other shows, and many that are far better than this one. Such as the previously mentioned Azumanga Daioh, Toradora, and one of my favorite shows, Little Busters. The animation in Flying Witch is really stinkin good. Scenery is beautiful and the characters are nicely detailed, despite their boring designs. HOWEVER. There is ONE thing in the animation that REALLY bugs me. And that is the character&#039;s noses. I know that that&#039;s a weird thing to complain about, but the character&#039;s noses all have this little light ring bubble on them, and it&#039;s VERRRRRRRY annoying to look at. Right from episode 1, that stupid light ring thingy bugged me, to no end. And it stays there, throughout the entire show. But other than that, the animation is near perfect.<br />
<br />
The only thing left to talk about is that there are some OVA episodes, for Flying Witch. There are 9 episodes, each being no more than 2 minutes long, and being animated in a chibi CG art style. As for the plot of these OVA&#039;s... they have just as much of a plot as the regular show. In other words... nothing at all. So in conclusion, Flying Witch is nothing special in the absolute slightest. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever be watching it, again. Though, I can&#039;t really say I HATED it, as weird as that sounds. It wasn&#039;t a bother to watch, being only 12 episodes. It was easy to follow, since there&#039;s literally nothing to follow, in the first place. It&#039;s nice to look at, and it may be fun to watch with your kids or younger siblings, since this is one of the few anime series that is actually appropriate for a very young audience. If you wanna watch this show to relax, I GUESS I can recommend it for that. Though, to save you some time, I would only recommend watching episodes 7, 8, 11, and 12. Those were my favorites out of the bunch, and you can honestly see what the entirety of the show is about, just by watching one of them. So ya. That&#039;s about it. If you&#039;re looking for a good slice of life show, with subtle magic that actually adds to the story, watch one of the Key anime. If you&#039;re looking for a slice of life with a plot, watch Ouran. If you&#039;re looking for a slice of life with actual comedy and actual characters, watch Azumanga. And if you want a show about literally nothing... watch Flying Witch... <br />
<br />
I&#039;m honestly not sure where to leave off this review. On one hand, I was ok with watching this and it certainly wasn&#039;t a bother to do so, but on the other hand, I got absolutely NOTHING from watching this. So I&#039;m gonna give this show a bit of a weird final score. If you&#039;re willing to watch this type of show and accept that you&#039;ll get absolutely nothing from watching it, I can give this show a 5. But if you don&#039;t want to watch this type of show, then I&#039;d give it a 0. I know that isn&#039;t really a fair rating, since the fact that a show was even able to be created deserves at least SOME respect. In that case, I&#039;ll give it a 1. But please know that my rating of 5 doesn&#039;t mean the show is decent, and my rating of 1 doesn&#039;t mean the show is terrible. I&#039;m giving it a 5, simply because it&#039;s the the most indifferent rating I can give. And with this show, I am 100% indifferent to its existence and to my experience watching it.<br />
<br />
Flying Witch gets either a 1/10 or a 5/10.

    I&#039;ll start off by saying kudos, Flying Witch. It really took me by surprise how much I ended up enjoying this show.<br />
<br />
I pick up a number of shows per season, and Flying Witch was the one I knew least about. I got a very relaxed vibe from the first few episodes so I stuck with it. By the end of its run I was in awe how much this magical slice of life had won me over.<br />
<br />
The colorful cast of characters we meet over the course of Flying Witch is definitely the standout ingredient here. Your typical slice of life is bound to have 1

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222802">
        or 2 unbearable characters, but I honestly loved everyone we came across over this journey; from the various witches like accidental-furry Inukai and the adorable cafe assistant Anzu, to their familiars and the various creatures inhabiting the magical realm. <br />
<br />
The main cast is extremely strong as well. Our witch-in-training Makoto is a very endearing main character. The little quirks like her lack of directional awareness are the greatest combination of goofy and adorable. Makoto&#039;s host family is also top-notch (I never understood that, were they related? Or just like really close family-friends? eh, it doesn&#039;t really matter). <br />
<br />
Older brother Kei is Makoto&#039;s age and has to be praised for how chill he is. I&#039;ve seriously never seen a dude in anime keep his cool so well around a house full of women. And there&#039;s no tacked on relationship between Kei and Makoto either. Their interactions throughout the show are extremely genuine and enjoyable. Everyone&#039;s interactions throughout this show are very well done, honestly. Even the parents, who lack the most screen time of the whole family have things to love about them. The mom is extremely mom-like, and the dad&#039;s heavy accent always gave me a good laugh, especially when his words flying right over Makoto&#039;s head.<br />
<br />
But I have to give the MVP to little sister Chinatsu. She was consistently the funniest and most adorable one of this show. Everything from the way she speaks, to her mannerisms and movements captured the essence of a young girl very well, and the magical atmosphere around her only heightened that great childlike sense of wonder.<br />
<br />
I could go on about these characters all day. I&#039;d love to talk about Makoto&#039;s rambunctious older sister Akane, or their feline familiar&#039;s Chito and Kenny, but we&#039;d be here all day. <br />
<br />
tl;dr: Characters - 10 outta 10.<br />
<br />
Next, we have to talk about the art. This is one of the most beautiful shows I&#039;ve seen recently, and that&#039;s coming from someone who is constantly on the prowl for shows with amazing art. The backgrounds and still-shots are impeccable. From flowing rivers with cherry blossoms overhead, to detailed close-ups of plants and vegetables, Flying Witch has some astonishingly great visuals.<br />
<br />
Not only is the art and animation beautiful, but the designs of creatures and characters from the magic world are a sight to behold. There are some wondrously imaginative designs throughout this show. While I did sometimes get a Ghibli-esque feeling of astonishment as the various magical beings appeared on screen, my appreciation for these uniquely designed creatures was more comparable to something from Dark Souls or Bloodborne, games I highly value for their artistic direction and whimsical designs. The Harbinger of Spring&#039;s arrival in episode 2, and the Curtain of Night visiting the cafe in episode 8 both gave me that eerily creepy, yet beautiful feeling I get from Dark Souls enemies. Through and through, Flying Witch did not disappoint in the visual department.<br />
<br />
The OP and ED are also filled with vibrant colors and breathtaking landscapes. They&#039;re both surprisingly catchy too. The soundtrack is the sweet little cherry on top of this wonderful sundae. It&#039;s very subtle, but adds tremendously to the mood of each scene.<br />
<br />
There is no central plot or story to this show, but it really didn&#039;t need one. The lack of conflict made for a calm and relaxing ride the entire time. The small victories and natural progression is enough for the show to feel like its moving and that these characters are learning and experiencing new things.<br />
<br />
The show is called Flying Witch, but Makoto doesn&#039;t even do that much flying, on screen anyways. The show moves forward at such a great pace, yet goes nowhere at all. We go along with Makoto each day on a new adventure, and though it doesn&#039;t seem like much, we do get to see, bit by bit, how she is coming to understand the world of magic surrounding her.<br />
<br />
We see Makoto gently float into the air in the first episode, as the world of witches is revealed to Chinatsu for the first time. Makoto is still a novice with her broom, and we see her struggle with the way she uncomfortably rides it at first. But once episode 12 rolled by, and we drift with her over the peaceful city of Aomori, we see her riding her broom properly. There was no training montage, or countless escapades of Makoto clumsily falling off her broom. No, we see her naturally progress through the time she spent with the Kuramoto&#039;s, and as things come to a close, seeing Makoto ride her broom with such ease bears the fruits of her growth to us.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t say it enough how much this show surprised me. I went in with zero expectations and left with something I&#039;ll hold as a magical experience of my own. Flying Witch came and went like that spring courier, filled with bewildering mystery, just to drift away after we&#039;ve only scratched the surface. There&#039;s so much beauty and history left to explore in the world of Flying Witch, and I hope there will be more of it to come in the future.<br />

    Despite the title &quot;Flying Witch&quot;, the show doesn&#039;t really feature a lot of Flying Witches or crazy witch battles. Instead, the show is just a super-relaxing slice-of-life series with a touch of magic. If you&#039;ve watched titles such as Non Non Biyori then you can expect the same atmosphere from this show. <br />
<br />
<br />
[Story]<br />
Flying Witch is basically about a 15 year old witch named Makoto who moved into a rural town called Aomori to train as a professional witch. This is where the slice-of-life atmosphere begins. <br />
<br />
The atmosphere of the show is super-relaxing. It&#039;s like you want to move out of this god-forsaken noisy/polluted city and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222824">
        just live the rest of your days in a (almost) pollution-free quiet rural environment. That&#039;s what I felt like when I was watching an episode of Flying Witch every week.<br />
<br />
I heard that the creators mentioned Flying Witch as an &quot;iyashikei&quot; show or in English, a &quot;healing&quot; anime show. It&#039;s purpose is to basically have a healing or soothing effect on the audience, such as myself. The creators were right! I&#039;m usually always busy on the weekends and having a show like Flying Witch calming down my stress level every week is a huge benefit for me. So not only does the show have a relaxing atmosphere but its &quot;iyashikei&quot;effect completely works and is the only reason why some of you lots shouldn&#039;t kill yourself. <br />
<br />
Flying Witch is definitely not for everyone and I can tell based on a few reviews/opinions that I&#039;ve heard from other people. Nothing much happens throughout the show and the pacing is very slow. This might put off people who aren&#039;t a fan of slice-of-life genre and some might even find this show extremely boring. That&#039;s completely understandable because not everyone wants to watch a character following a cat around the town for an entire episode or drinking at a cafe for half of the episode. However to me, scenes such as the one I recently listed, weren&#039;t boring at all. They executed it in a way that made a scene like a character following a cat around the town for an entire episode not boring at all. <br />
<br />
One last aspect that I want to talk about is the comedy. They are well done. The comedy isn&#039;t forced and they just let the characters do their thing while at the same time, not overdoing it so the funny moments doesn&#039;t turn stale. For example, Makoto is somewhat of a klutz and has a bad sense of direction. The show used them to make hilarious moments but they didn&#039;t overdo it to the point where she would come off as a dumb character. The character dynamics are also great and they really know how to pair these characters up to create a bunch of cute, heart warming and/or hilarious moments. Also, I forgot to mention that Chinatsu&#039;s reactions in the first few episodes are hilarious. It&#039;s a kind of reaction that you&#039;d expect when seeing something so bizarre happening right in front of your eyes and just comes of as unbelievable at first.  What makes it even more hilarious is the fact that she&#039;s just a 9-year old kid and she&#039;s seeing something that she&#039;d never expect that she&#039;ll see. <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[Art/Animation]: (9/10)<br />
Looking at Flying Witch&#039;s visuals and animation makes me somewhat excited at how future J.C Staff&#039;s anime will look like. This is actually their best visuals yet and it&#039;s way better than their previous works such as Index and Railgun. The visuals looks almost like real life at first look and the character designs are well done and it&#039;s not as bland as it used to be when comparing this show to their most recent work. <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[Sound]: (10/10)<br />
The soundtrack definitely, and I mean DEFINITELY played a huge role on why the atmosphere is relaxing. The OSTs are phenomenal. Few examples are those slow piano bits or those slow guitar parts with a flute(?) playing at the same time. I really want to import those CD soundtracks. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)<br />
<br />
The OP theme song is &quot;Sharanran&quot; by miwa feat. 96 Neko. The OP theme song is absolutely catchy and I have been listening to it for the past 12 weeks. Also, those claps though. The ED theme song is &quot;Nichijou no Mahou&quot; by Makoto and Chinatsu. Same case as the OP. I love the song and both voice actors have great singing voices. It&#039;s not something that I&#039;d expect from a slice-of-life show though but I guess it works. <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[Characters]: (9/10)<br />
The characters are amazing. Each and every one of them has a set of unique personalities that makes them likable in their own ways. None of them came off as annoying. Especially, Chinatsu and Makoto who I thought was going to be very annoying at first but after watching the first episode, the way they acted was realistic and it blew my mind. I mean, it&#039;s rare to feature a cast of characters with realistic personalities instead of our usual &quot;Character has to be one of the &quot;dere&quot; traits&quot;. For example, Chinatsu was acting like how a kid her age should act and it&#039;s hard to believe that Makoto is a 15 year old teenager considering the fact that she&#039;s super mature for her age and she likes to do adult stuff like farming, picking out plants and etc. Though, that doesn&#039;t mean Makoto acts exactly like an adult. Some of the things she does can come off as rather immature but that&#039;s normal since she&#039;s just a 15 year old teenager. <br />
<br />
Like I said above, the character dynamics are amazing. Pair one of these characters up with another character and you&#039;re going to get the same result regardless. A cute, heart-warming, smile-inducing, and funny moments. Chinatsu, Chito-san and Makoto does take the cake though whenever they&#039;re on screen.  <br />
<br />
If you were to ask me like who&#039;s my favourite characters in the series then it would go something like this:<br />
Chinatsu &gt; Chito-san &gt; Akane &gt; Makoto &gt; Nao ..... and etc. <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[Enjoyment]: (9/10)<br />
I had low expectations from this series before it aired but after the first few episodes, I ended up enjoying this anime as much as I did watching Non Non Biyori and Non Non Biyori Repeat. <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[VERDICT]<br />
Out of 3 slice-of-life animes that I watched this season, Flying Witch is, no doubt, the best slice-of-life this season. The show&#039;s atmosphere is very relaxing and I&#039;m glad that magic isn&#039;t widely used in the series. It shows us magic is one of those mysterious elements in our world. The characters are amazing and the show just lets these characters do whatever it wants, which lead to a bunch of cute, heart-warming, smile-inducing, and funny moments.  Now, I&#039;m bummed out that I won&#039;t get my weekly doses of Flying Witch anymore to relieve my stress levels. <br />
<br />
[OVERALL]: (9/10)<br />
<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
+The show&#039;s atmosphere is very relaxing<br />
+Relaxing pacing<br />
+Best animation J.C Staff has produced yet<br />
+Very relaxing soundtrack<br />
+Fun cast of characters<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />

    Spring 2016 is a season full of highs and lows. I mostly dealt with the latter, making myself too submerged in the negativity. But here comes Flying Witch, a show that has become known by now as a healing experience. Watching the show never fails to improve my mood. Everything about it just screams positivity and sunshine from the calming atmosphere, joyful characters, and the laid-back story. The often atmospheric moments such as scenery shots accompanied with beautiful calming music is truly bliss. The story of a young witch training in unfamiliar yet welcoming territory reminds me a lot of Kiki’s Delivery Service, one of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222803">
        my favourite Ghibli films. While it does not offer any actual plot, each episode offers an adventure that constantly introduces supernatural elements and fits them well into the lighthearted slice-of-life approach. It does bother me occasionally that no one really bats an eye that witches live on their daily lives without trying to conceal their identity. The show doesn’t really explain if witches are a norm in the society, or that the characters are just air-headed enough to not really care. <br />
<br />
One main gripe I have with the show is that it could have utilized its story better. The show presents Makoto as a witch in training but we don’t get any actual specifics regarding how the world of witches work aside from other witches that are introduced in the show such as her sister Akane. We get to see some witch stuff happening but it’s mostly shown as amusement though some fit in the “witch training” department. The show does try to blur the boundary between the two worlds but it would have been great if the show used more than one perspective.<br />
<br />
Overall, I recommend this show to slice-of-life fans who would like to see something atmospheric, calming, meditative, and positive. It doesn’t use its potential to the fullest but nevertheless a fleeting euphoric experience.<br />

    REVIEW: Flying Witch<br />
<br />
&quot;How is this rated a 7.69!? This is a great slice-of-life anime. In my opinion. Why? Well, read my review and you&#039;ll see why!<br />
<br />
Story: (8/10) Here&#039;s my take on the synopsis. Makoto, being the witch she is, the story practically revolves around her alongside her cousins, Kei and Chinatsu. With the start of each episode, as a witch in training, Makoto explores Aomori, Japan with her two cousins to expand her surroundings. By exploring together, the crew encounters many things. May it be companions, magical beings, creatures and places unperceivable from the human eye! With the help of her surroundings and as a

        witch living with her two cousins in Aomori, Japan, her goal is to become a &#039;Flying Witch&#039; someday!<br />
<br />
Art: (8/10) The animation is fluid, and simply beautiful since this anime is made by the one and only and as expected J.C. Staff! The creators who made Toradora!, Kaichou wa-maid Sama! and many other notable anime! There&#039;s nothing more great you can get from them (well, there are a few exceptions), but can expect great art from this anime!<br />
<br />
Sound: (8/10): The music is one of it&#039;s strong points. Because, two words. It&#039;s. Relaxing. And. Soothing. That&#039;s five, nevermind. But anyways, for those who have watched Gin no Saji, the singer   &#039;miwa&#039; sings both the first opening of Gin no Saji and for the opening of this anime as well! I can appreciate that the opening, ending, and let&#039;s not forget the soundtrack matched the tone and quality of this anime! <br />
<br />
Character(s) (8/10): You may think the characters are dull, boring, and are lacking of variety through the first two episodes. But, the characters are as well one of its strong points. The reason why it&#039;s one of it&#039;s strong points because it strays away from all the other anime cliques we&#039;re all tired seeing of. Don&#039;t expect any dere(s), loli(s), shota(s) and etc. But do expect some quite interesting magical beings as well as adorable little creatures! As each and every character have a fun, original, unique personality to them! <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10): By watching the first two episodes, my first impression of this anime was &#039;indifferent&#039;. I thought it would be some other anime slice-of-life cliche. As the third episode strolled along however, I found newfound respect for this anime. The fun adventures they have together, things they find that are unperceivable from the human eye, make me want to be part of their adventures! A fantasy you&#039;d want to indulged in. As that being the case, I can quite say that I&#039;d enjoyed this anime. <br />
<br />
Overall (9/10): Along with Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge, this anime stands as one of the best anime to watch of the Spring season. Each and every episode was filled with intriguing stories, I must say, to watch! I can say that the characters even though they were simple, were unique in a way! Art was presented greatly as expected from the J.C. Staff. Sound absolutely was relaxing and soothing at the most part! Most importantly I enjoyed this anime from beginning to end! If you want a relaxing and soothing anime to watch after watching a &#039;stressful&#039; anime, I definitely recommend this one! Expect yourself to smile and chuckle at each and ever episode! <br />
<br />
- I want a season two! <br />

    Flying Witch has to be the most light heartening refreshing anime ever made. It&#039;s a far deviation away from a typical school SOL and (violent) adventure types,  I can&#039;t really put the right words together to describe it. I invite you to join the world of Flying witch because I do not think you will be disappointed. The character development is great and every second of every episode leaves you with a sense of fulfillment. Which is a very hard thing to have. The show is bright and airy and well...Just go watch it!<br />
<br />
Keep in mind with this though: Not a lot really happens

          <span style="display: none;" id="review227627">
        in this anime. There is no backbone story line guiding the plot in any one direction. It&#039;s just a hodgepodge of &quot;let&#039;s do this today!&quot; So if you&#039;re not really into that, this may not be your cup of tea.

    Flying Witch is possibly one of the most relaxed, tranquil anime bestowed upon this world. This show was a gem among stones this season, with nothing else keeping me particularly hyped for the next episode. Despite this show having a basic plot and absolutely no movement in the story (not physically anyway) this was absolutely one of my favourites this season.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
Flying Witch is about, well, a flying witch. Her name is Kowata Makoto, she leaves the city of Yokohama to live with her relatives in the small town of Aomori to train as a witch. That&#039;s about it, each episode depicts the antics all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223455">
        the characters get up to together, from simple activities like cooking at school or making a vegetable patch, to creating potions and discovering new spells accompanied by the other witch characters, Akane (Makoto&#039;s sister) and Inukai (Akane&#039;s friend). These activities were enjoyable to watch, there was no flashy spell-casting or explosions or intensity, just relaxing and calming to watch. <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The setting of Aomori is absolutely beautiful, lush landscapes and aerial shots of the town and surrounding environment are frequently shown and used effectively to transition scenes and display the location of our characters next &quot;everyday&quot; event. The characters looked fairly stock-standard, you&#039;ve seen this style before, but it is nice to look at, they look like normal people. I think that&#039;s another reason this show feels so relaxing to watch, the characters don&#039;t look like they&#039;re out to fight evil or blow shit up, they lead normal lives and do normal stuff, simple and effective.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
While the OP of Flying Witch is questionable at times, personally I enjoyed it sometimes, didn&#039;t really at others. The ED was beautiful, really nice way to tie off each episode, especially as sometimes I didn&#039;t even feel it coming, and assumed it was part of the episode. On the topic of that, the soundtrack was incredible, so god damn tranquil. The quiet sounds of the mornings accompanied by soothing acoustic guitar sets each episode off with a fresh and warm feeling. The SFX used in comedic scenes also works perfectly, with a wonky, quirky tone to it that, in my opinion, emphasizes the scenes dialogue or topic effectively.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
You&#039;ve seen all these characters before, they are quite easy to predict and you can guess their next personality trait in an instant. But, this doesn&#039;t mean they don&#039;t keep the show going, Makoto is gorgeously bubbly and excited by such simple things you can&#039;t help but gush, Akane receives the label of crazy, adventurous, show-offy alcoholic big sister, but still adds important input to the dialogue and her storytelling adds an entire new level to the world that the show is set in. Kei and Chinatsu are both great characters, Kei being the understanding, kind and welcoming male lead, always willing to spark the events of the episode, and teach both the other characters and the viewer (well, me at the least) new things about the particular activity being done. Chinatsu is cute as fuck, and her excitement and open-mindedness makes every scene a happy one, her charm and bubbly personality surpass Makoto, and her clueless-ness at some points has a very distinct curiousity to it, pulling the viewer in and forming a surrogacy of inquisition.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
I enjoyed this show very much, I enjoyed watching these simple characters interact and grow deeper bonds with each other as they performed everyday tasks and just simply had innocent fun together. That&#039;s really all there is to it, this show has such a simple formula and executes it perfectly. Making such simple activities interesting to watch and difficult to stop.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
Basically if you&#039;ve got a cup of tea or something in your hands, lying in bed, or on the couch, relaxed in the early morning and you watch this, you&#039;ve pretty much got no excuse not to feel spectacularly tranquil and enlightened. If your looking for something light-hearted and easy to watch, I encourage you to watch Flying Witch. <br />

    Flying witch was my choice  for the slice of life of the season.<br />
There&#039;s usually no guarantee for a currently airing show to be good, but with slice of life you at least get consistency.<br />
But I feel like flying witch was something better than just a normal SoL show.<br />
<br />
The story of Flying witch is really simple, it just follows around a soon to become witch in a world where magic exists.<br />
There is some overarching parts to it, new characters get occasionally introduced and aren&#039;t forgotten about for example.<br />
<br />
Mostly the show is just the daily life of a witch, but it occasionally breaks into scenic shots

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221895">
        and keeps everything fresh with a few jokes.<br />
Even the magic in the show is played very casually, like it wasn&#039;t a big deal.<br />
This all makes for a pretty funny, atmospheric and relaxing episodes.<br />
Of course anyone who absolutely demands lots of story in their anime will most likely get bored by it.<br />
<br />
At this point you can already tell that I&#039;m going to recommend it but I still haven&#039;t described what makes it so different from other SoL anime.<br />
<br />
For one almost none of this series takes place in a school, which allows for much more varied scenery.<br />
The comedy is never played in an over the top fashion in an otherwise down to earth show.<br />
The character designs aren&#039;t made with only cuteness and character appeal in mind, making the characters seem more real.<br />
The magic in the show allows the characters to do more than just things that are mundane, even if it&#039;s nothing special to them.<br />
It also allows for some subtle world building.<br />
I could fit none of the characters into a clear cut archetype, which made them more interesting to watch.<br />
All of that adds up to a very well executed show.<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t said anything about the overall visuals yet, but JC staff did a pretty good job.<br />
Flying witch had on of the catchiest opening songs this season, and the background tracks fit were as relaxing as the show itself.<br />
<br />
So yes, I would recommend checking out flying witch to anyone who likes SoL.<br />
The only problem is that even though I watched all of it, it isn&#039;t really my type of a show.

    I&#039;ve watched a ton of slice of life shows, and I&#039;ve got to say, some shows have sort of the wrong idea about what makes a slice of life enjoyable. I mean, actually just sitting through a 12 episode series about a person going through their mundane life is absolutely boring, and not exactly something that you should try to achieve in a slice of life. Sure, it can be about someone&#039;s mundane life, but it&#039;s got to be enjoyable in some way shape or form, whether it be characters, the story/setting, or the dialogue. Either way, a slice of life is not successful because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332858">
        it&#039;s actually just some random person&#039;s day to day life.<br />
<br />
Flying witch is basically this. Non non biyori, Nichijou, Miname ke, even lucky star or something are good because they have &quot;normal,&quot; yet fun characters. Slice of life is obviously held up by their well made characters. Whether it be dialogue, relationships, or drama, characters play a pivotal role in whether or not a slice of life is well made. Those shows I mentioned above had great characters. I found them funny, interesting, or just relaxing to watch. <br />
Flying witch, on the other hand, is basically a bunch of side characters talking to each other, and you start wondering where the main character is. The fact that the traits of the main character can be summarized by &quot;eccentric,&quot; and &quot;bad sense of direction&quot; even by episode 5-6, you&#039;ve got a problem. The fact that the same dialogue or scenario about these two traits happening with the main character, only in slightly different setting is just boring and predictable. Everything about the dialogue in this show is dead. No liveliness at all. It just feels like it&#039;s a script that people are reading off of. <br />
Non non biyori also makes use of the setting much more than Flying witch ever did.  They both feature a typical countryside town, yet the characters in Non non biyori actually interact and mesh with the setting extremely well. They do things that can only be done in the countryside, and the animation also has a lot of extremely vibrant scenes, attention to detail, and backgrounds dedicated to the setting. It&#039;s a great example of how a simple cast of characters can be elevated due to the well made setting and dialogue<br />
<br />
As for Flying Witch, the setting is tossed aside. In fact, the episode settings and dialogue can actually taking place in any suburban or urban area. Like I said before, dialogue is extremely boring and uninteresting, and the author takes liberties in the character&#039;s actions so that the show can seem less boring.<br />
That&#039;s basically what Flying Witch is trying to do: seem more interesting than it actually looks. &quot;Wow, my story is very bland, and my characters are also quite the boring lot, how about we make the main character a witch? Haha, that will make my story good.&quot; That&#039;s basically what I think the author was trying to go for. Magic and witches are only talked about when there&#039;s another witch other than the main character in the scene. It&#039;s like there&#039;s a slice of life portion of the story, and then the witch/magic part of the story. They don&#039;t work in tandem, and mix like oil and water. There isn&#039;t any attempt to incorporate magic into everyday life, but rather, it&#039;s just a quirk of the main character. Instead, it&#039;s just boring slice of life scenarios. Then, when that becomes boring, as it surely does, then stuff about witches and magic come up again to keep your attention. Rinse and repeat. Unfortunate that instead of making a story about a main character using magic in their everyday life, it&#039;s about a witch that doesn&#039;t use magic unless the story permits, thus essentially making most of the episodes completely unrelated to her witch identity, which is pretty stupid when it&#039;s an integral part of the plot.<br />
<br />
All in all, this show is a dime in a dozen  put in with all the other failures of slice of life shows.<br />

    Flying witch is a laid back slice of life anime with one of the most charming characters i&#039;ve ever seen. It follows the story of Kowata Makoto who&#039;s a witch in training. All of the episodes cover the everyday life of this girl and her family and friends.<br />
<br />
What i like about Flying Witch in general is how relaxing it is. Now it is just a typical slice of life anime at first glance but each episode you start to enjoy it more and more until you can&#039;t get enough. <br />
<br />
What makes this a masterpiece is the combination of charming characters, gorgeous art, and over the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review235430">
        top calming music. All of these just compliment each other so well.<br />
<br />
From this point on there&#039;s some really minor spoilers so keep in mind. REALLY minor.<br />
<br />
[Story] (This part have some minor spoilers, you can skip this.)<br />
Even though there&#039;s really not much into the story in Flying Witch, or slice of life anime in general. But Flying Witch just makes the simplest and boring stuff interesting. What i noticed while watching Flying Witch is how this anime has ZERO drama. There&#039;s absolutely no drama, everyone&#039;s so chill all the time. There were plots where i thought there would be some drama but no they just play it off and it turned into a funny scene and i laughed my ass off. By the way, yeah this anime is really funny. Found myself can&#039;t stop laughing at times.<br />
<br />
[Art]<br />
The art is well typical J.C Studio style, of course with it&#039;s own characteristics for Flying Witch. What makes this special is just how beautiful it is. Especially the green scenery and everything. Deserve a solid 9.<br />
<br />
[Music]<br />
Now the music in this anime is just extremely calming and just gives off that country side feel, kind of like harvest moon/stardew valley (game) vibe. They fit in the anime so well. This whole anime reminds me of stardew valley, how they pick up wild plants in the side of the street and cooks them, just like in the game. Anyway i&#039;m sidetracking, the music gets a 10 from me.<br />
<br />
[Characters]<br />
The characters can be described as a few words: Charming, happy, cheerful, silly, funny, chill,cute and more. They are absolutely no antagonist in the anime. Don&#039;t forget about the familiars in the anime, they are characters too. My favorite is Chito the black cat. SO CUTE. The facial expression in this anime are hilarious af.<br />
<br />
[Enjoyment]<br />
 Definitely was not bored while watching any of the episodes. They 20 mins episode felt like 5 mins, they went by so quick. Really enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
[Overall]<br />
This was one of the best slice of life anime&#039;s i&#039;ve watched. Of course it&#039;s not for everyone, maybe someone find it boring or uninteresting but it&#039;s definitely good for me. If you find it boring the first few episodes, don&#039;t stop watching. You&#039;ll fall in love later. Might even get a S2 since there&#039;s still manga material to be covered.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s it from me, this is just my opinion, if yours is different well no problem. Have a good one.

Flying Witch...where i have to begin?<br />
Fan of the &quot;usual magic&quot; anime series should think twice before watching this work, because it has almost nothing to do with the common magic that we are used to see. It has magic, that&#039;s sure, but it&#039;s different, more classic and, in some ways, more deep.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
Why only 6? Because that series doesn&#039;t have a story, and doesn&#039;t need it, in my humble opinion.<br />
The events of the various episodes are well managed, so the time will flow easily while watching.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
What can i say...the &quot;visual&quot; part of the anime is not memorable, but it fits perfectly the pace

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229306">
        and the atmosphere of the series, and for me that&#039;s the most important thing.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
Nice voice acting and pretty op/ed. The main dish, though, is the OST; it harmonize with sceneries, moods and situations, giving a push on the emotions that the spectator feels.<br />
<br />
Character: 7<br />
I have to say it, as the story doesn&#039;t exist, even the characters aren&#039;t so original or deep, or have some sort of development trough the series...but they work, and the work pretty well.<br />
With so many anime out there i think that&#039;s nearly absurd to pretend originality everywhere, so i don&#039;t give much weight to that point in my evaluation.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
This series was a fresh wind that have traveled trough seasons, bringing along the scent of everything that has encountered, and the results it&#039;s something great.<br />
It&#039;s a slice of life, the comedy part is not so funny, the &quot;witch magic&quot; appears maybe one time for episode, but the real magic is everywhere. If I have to analize every single element the rate will not be so high, but the show have a strange sort of alchemy that it was able to put all the parts in a pot, cook them at low fire and take out the best from all.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8 well deserved!

    Flying Witch has next to no conflict yet manages to remain engaging through its atmosphere, picturesque scenery, and soothing soundtrack. The show places utmost attention on the mundane to provide a sense of beauty for the ordinary that is easy to miss in real life.  By basing some of its locations on real life settings, it further adds to its realism. Tasks such as gardening and cooking are ones that Flying Witch tackles while (hopefully)  retaining the vewer&#039;s interest through its atmosphere and grounded character interactions. The characters in Flying Witch are  less exaggerated than in some other slice of life series,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review238303">
        even amidst its use of magic. Some of the show&#039;s comedy is effective precisely because it juxtaposes the mundane attitudes of its characters with the magical scenarios at play. The show effectively incorporates  magical realism by  treating magic and ordinary reality as essentially equivalent, leading to magic appearing to be ordinary and the ordinary appearing to be magical. <br />
<br />
Rather than bouts of spectacle, the show showcases tasks such as microwaving onions and thinning flowers from an apple tree for half an episode. However, the show nails the interactions enough to retain engagement. Akane&#039;s playfulness coupled with Makoto&#039;s carelessness enables entertaining antics when the former is teaching the latter magic. Chinatsu&#039;s childlike and organic reactions to every situation are the most potent in the entire series, and Kei&#039;s reserved nature helps ground every event into a state of peace rather than conflict.  The characters mostly behave in an ordinary and organic manner, which is appropriate for such a series. There is an element of realism to the blandness of the characters, as it reflects how uninteresting  real life individuals could appear to be in ordinary scenarios. One may argue that the lack of conflict  in the series is forced, but there can be many time-spans in real life where little to no conflict occurs. <br />
<br />
Some of Flying Witch&#039;s issues include the idealization of witches and plastic character faces. For a show mostly grounded in reality,  witches never being viewed negatively can break suspension of disbelief. The faces can appear too artificial at times, and the female characters can be portrayed as too idealistically beautiful. Although this is common in anime, this is less appropriate for a grounded work that should better highlight physical imperfections of ordinary characters.  <br />
<br />
Final Verdict:<br />
<br />
<br />
Flying Witch is a soothing series that achieves its goals. The animation, soundtrack, character interactions, and attention to a detailed setting all work to enhance the experience. For those generally interested in Iyashikei series may find Flying Witch to be worth watching. <br />

    Shalalala~!!!...<br />
<br />
flying witch is one of the best healing anime this Spring 2016.<br />
<br />
flying witch&#039;s plot is looking at the daily lives of a witch living in the rural side with her relatives and this anime looks at both sides of both rural farming and magic.<br />
<br />
The characters aren&#039;t anything new as the setting of the rural town to the anime being a slice of life anime, the characters are just as laxxing as the genre flying witch is in, however there were two characters that breaks this, that being ever-enthusiastic Chinatsu Kuramoto voiced by Eri Suzuki, the younger sister of Kei, relatives to Makoto and Makoto&#039;s free

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221929">
        spirited older sister Akane Kowata voiced by Kana Aoi, Akane brings in some flair and the magical side to flying witch and just her nonchalantly coming in and feels like a firework just appears, Chinatsu on the other side feels like an audience surrogate to this anime as she looks at both sides of this anime&#039;s setting of the magical witchcraft side and the rural side and really Chinatsu just made this anime what it is. Makoto Kowata voiced by Minami Shinoda, the main character is really our eyes for both the rural and magical world that she lives in and her quirks such as having no sense of direction and always in awe and slightly naive with the rural life but nonchalantly ambitious when it comes to magic make her memorable along with Chinatsu and Akane. <br />
<br />
The comedy in this anime does have them for a good punchline here and there, from the rural comedic skits that are charming (to some of them that &quot;kinda land&quot;), for the magic side, the punchline hits a bit better and the main cause of that would be the eccentric characters of being both catalysts and reactants to them (Akane and Chinatsu respectively) that works in it&#039;s favour<br />
<br />
The animation done by JC Staff feels like what would happen if Studio Ghibli&#039;s background artist came into JC Staff as the background to heck even the character designs have that feel to it. flying witch REALLY is a laxxing anime from the animation to the setting.<br />
<br />
In terms of voice acting, it was nothing special and once again the voice actors have something of a laxxing tone to them well cept Eri Suzuki due to having bundles of energy and her childlike and whimsical nature. One thing LA found weird was that the cats in this anime, those being Chito voiced by Ai Kayano and Kenny voiced by Ayane Sakura just do &quot;cat noises&quot;, it&#039;s not horrible or anything but Ai Kayano and Ayane Sakura must have a laxxing time with this anime as well.<br />
<br />
The music is like the animation largely reminiscent of Studio Ghibili&#039;s and the music really wrings in the atmosphere  from the whimsical to the comically aloof moments here and there, LA usually doesn&#039;t talk about the music in the anime, but flying witch kinda had to remind LA about the music.<br />
<br />
LA might as well say this about slice of life animes, many people might dismiss it as a waste of time or &quot;too moe&quot;, but really LA can see why not only from flying witch but many other slice of life animes is that it doesn&#039;t need to be intense, batshit crazy full of action or intense drama, we really DO kind of need these of kinds of animes where we and along with the characters to be relaxed and not really need to be 100% invested in all the intense drama or action, just characters doing their everyday things with a comedic flair and flying witch is one of the pinnacle examples of healing slice of life animes that puts this statement and flies with it no pun intended.<br />
<br />
LA will say it again, &quot;flying witch is one of the best healing anime this Spring 2016&quot; and really if you wanted to have a relaxing anime with no stakes and just want to relax with the characters of this anime then flying witch is a perfect choice.

    Flying Witch is a fantastic series and breaks the norm from the supernatural series of the past and present.<br />
<br />
As I will say every time, I love any series that is set in a rural area. Something about it enables me to relax and take in a show with little to no effort while still enjoying it. What&#039;s more is we get witches and the like added to the mix. Normally, when it comes to having this element in a series, it mostly involves shounen battle sequences, good versus evil and whatnot. Here, we just have witches (the rest mostly being spirits of nature) living amongst

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222051">
        humans with no conflict. Rarely do we see this ever happen, and I&#039;m glad a series like this exists.<br />
<br />
What also makes this entertaining is the characters. They&#039;re all likable and have some good interactions with each other. From the timing of their dialogue to their amusing expressions, it&#039;s hard not to smile when you see these characters appear.<br />
<br />
I think what makes this a good series set in the &quot;countryside&quot; is how the animation depicts the scenery. So much detail is put into the houses and the nature that it looks realistic. Also, the character designs are very appealing and cute.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t think that I dislike anything action-oriented or shows that are strictly shounen, far from it. It&#039;s just, you do see a lot of them with each season, and it can get a little tiresome. Which is why shows like Flying Witch allow me to take a breather. It&#039;s a nice change of pace; it&#039;s meant to be relaxing where you can easily take in everything.
