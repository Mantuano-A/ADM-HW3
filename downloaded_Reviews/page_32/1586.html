    This is going to be the best isekai in this year, I have ever watched. After I have seen the final episode of this anime, It was.. VERY IMPRESSIVE. So this is a second time I have ever review anime, I hope you guys will get anything from anything I had written here so first of all;<br />
<br />
Story: (6/10) It&#039;s just an unoriginal isekai with a goddess who just summon a Hero from our or ANOTHER world to help ANOTHER(of ANOTHER) world. Konosuba was made it before, An Isekai, comedy, Sitcom But now instead of Kazuma, we have Seiya. A Cautious Hero... Very Cautious Hero. Summoned

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325016">
        by useless goddess named Aq- ahem! Rista who is just a goddess of support, She can heal and just that. They were going to save ANOTHER WORLD from &quot;4 demon lord&quot;. What a classic MMORPG game! (ahem! Anime). but that just a big plot for this anime. but what is in between is.... A F*CKING SITCOM COMEDY. If you were going to watch this show for a SUPER SERIOUS ACTION FANTASY SHOW like &quot;The Raising Of The Sheild Hero&quot; then I were going to be disappointed because you can guess from the title &quot;The Hero Is &quot;OVERPOWERED&quot;&quot;. Yes from the title the MC was actually OP but not that much from the middle point (I am not going to spoiled). Summery this is an unoriginal but actually very great at try to be an original Isekai, Comedy, Sitcom show like Konosuba but It&#039;s actually great as you&#039;re worth watching it.<br />
<br />
Art&amp;Animation: (7/10) The art is ok and the animation&#039;s overall doesn&#039;t look bad and the CGI....at least this show have less CGI than arifureta in the last season but the CGI in this anime is not pretty bad it&#039;s just...uhhh....that but it&#039;s doesn&#039;t appear quickly in this show I think the first CGI (except for Rista figure in the first episode) I ever seen in this show is in middle to final phase of this anime. But you know a comedy show still has it&#039;s own unique way to an art style (Unique because I didn&#039;t watch that much comedy anime so I didn&#039;t is this unique but it just unique for me) especially for Rista. This show had a few bunch of jokes, so what will they(White fox) going to do with that. Do a funny face on Rista; she will do a lots of face reaction in this series and it&#039;s always funny to see the art stylev change while she doing a reaction faces because thats the funniest thing.<br />
<br />
Sound: (8/10) The Opening Theme &quot;TIT FOR TAT&quot; by MYTH &amp; ROID, the sound of the Isekai anime. so honestly the op is very amazing and the best thing in this op is, It has 2 version of it; The first one is have more still frame than the second one and The Second One, you will have a goddess dance in the middle of the OP and it&#039;s F*CKING GORGEOUS! and now it&#039;s time for The Ending;<br />
The Ending Theme &quot;be perfect, plz!&quot; by Riko Azuna is ok... pretty ok, because in the ED we&#039;ll have CGI Rista dances for 1:29 seconds but it&#039;s ok to understand because the Rista that dances in ED is a figures that Rista give to Seiya and if you see carefully, You will see the background is usually looks like a Figure&#039;s Plate on a table like in the anime and the end of ED.<br />
The Soundtracks, uhh pretty ok not that much expect but pretty ok.<br />
Sound effects, if you compared to Fire force in some episode that changes the hit sound effects into earape farts meme sound effects sh*t.<br />
This anime has a great sound effects.<br />
The Voice actings, especially for Rista&#039;s VA(&quot;Toyosaki, Aki&quot;) this is have a lot&#039;s of fun on listening anime charactor speaking to each other with this quality and it&#039;s remind me Konosuba for an Aqua Voice acting too. It&#039;s funny to listening tho.<br />
<br />
Charactors: (8/10) The anime has it&#039;s own unique charactor design and development as well.<br />
Seiya at the started, he&#039;s very Cautious but from that from the middle point, he&#039;s personality changes a little bit as I see. Ok let;s talk about his ability; He is very OP. yes he is from the beginning very OP because he is just training and training and keep training but it&#039;s has a back story a very dark back story, what he actually faces before Rista (I won&#039;t spoiled more than that, Go watched it by yourself!!!!)<br />
Rista... she is just a comedian that waiting Seiya to makes a funny jokes then she will makes a meme reaction faces and the rest of the seies as well as episode 10-12, her development begins to shine.<br />
Two additional charactor; Eruru and Mash, they have a development too but it&#039;s ok to see their development by training and training and... not using thier ailities in the fight because Seiya can just handle by him self tho. so not much to see but I love how I was expect to see their ability when they were training but was destroy by the MC but still exciting to see.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (9/10) Summery, this is an unoriginal but actually very great at try to be an original Isekai, Comedy, Sitcom show like Konosuba but It&#039;s actually great as you&#039;re worth watching it. I would like to watched Isekai anime but not all I like such as Isekai cheat magician-<br />
&quot;Isekai cheat magician made me wants to sleep. This is the feel of you are on your bed&quot; - NZ 2019<br />
But this is a comdey isekai show, If it&#039;s boring it couldn&#039;t be this enjoyable. So remember my words-*<br />
<br />
Overall: (8/10) *&quot;If you have a free time, go and watch it, It&#039;s worth to watch&quot; thats it. Thank you for reading my review.<br />
<br />

    *This review contains spoilers in a marked section*<br />
<br />
All it takes is one glance at Cautious Hero’s title to know everything you need to know about it. It summarizes the story, the main character, and the anime’s one and only joke.<br />
<br />
The titular cautious hero is the worst part of the show. Seiya is the hero, but he has no personality. He&#039;s everything you&#039;d expect from an edgy isekai protagonist—an overpowered asshole. He&#039;s accompanied by the much more colorful goddess of healing, Ristarte. She summons Seiya to help her defeat the demon king. Compared to the potential heroes, Seiya has significantly higher stats, but there&#039;s a catch.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325010">
        He&#039;s impossibly cautious. Ristarte thought there&#039;s no way his flaw would outweigh his skills, and she needed a hero desperately. She fucked up.<br />
<br />
I don’t know what I expected, Seiya sucks as a protagonist because you can never tell what he’s thinking unless he says it aloud. The few times he does say something, it’s some bitchy comments about Rista being a dumbass. No matter how many kind things she does for him, he treats her like crap. She&#039;s nice, really, yet the show never allows her to gain confidence. He keeps her around to heal him and cook—but eventually, he just uses healing potions. Seiya could be replaced with an angry plank of wood and there’d be no difference. He&#039;s motivated to protect himself first, then save the world, no one else matters. He almost qualifies as a villain because of how he chooses to use his overpowered stats. Needless to say, he’s not a hero. Which is the point of this Satirical Comedy: It tries to imitate Konosuba in many ways, maybe a little too much.<br />
<br />
There was a fight early on where Seiya burnt down an entire village of innocent people. What was his reason? Caution. It was never mentioned later on. After that incident, any chance of he would become a ‘good guy’ was off the table. No nuance, no clever writing, he is just a humorless asshole. The jokes never evolve because Seiya never changes. This wouldn’t be a big problem if the story progressed. So does it? Well, kind of... Like most isekai fantasies, the goal is for the hero to save the world from a demonic threat. Seiya levels up so fast that no enemy could stand in his way. Forget power scaling, they only use MMO terms for the target audience. For humor&#039;s sake, this is fine. For the story, it is detrimental. A threadbare story is expected from a gag comedy. However, there’s nothing to the show other than the stale jokes, it gets tedious to watch very fast  <br />
<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the first episode, but after that, I realized there would be nothing to it but that one joke—and it didn’t take long for me to get sick of it. I started to wonder why. Why is this guy so cautious? Why was he the one summoned? Why does he have the personality of a potato? I waited for an explanation, I waited for character development. It did not come until the final episodes. <br />
<br />
(Spoilers Below)<br />
<br />
In the eleventh hour, there&#039;s a twist that reveals Seiya wasn&#039;t always a shitty person. He was summoned to fight in the same world once before, but this time he was overly ambitious and kind. Every fight left him with 1 HP. He would run into impossible fights and always win—until he and his party got killed by a boss with two lives. When he is reincarnated, he gets told to always be cautious, even though people will hate him. In some way, this twist is supposed to excuse how he treats everyone. He made his companions, Mash and Elulu, mules to carry equipment, not because they&#039;re useless but because he was trying to protect them! He shit talked Ristarte and treated her like his maid because he wanted to protect her! So all along, Seiya treated everyone like objects because objects are easy to keep safe. Uh, huh. <br />
<br />
The twist adds nothing to him. He’s still a cowardly asshole, yet his caution isn&#039;t a flaw because it always works out in the end. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, all good twists should be surprising, but upon reflection, you should see where it was hinted. Cautious Hero misses this. The twist comes out of buttfucking nowhere and it adds nothing but transparent emotional manipulation. This anime breaks the basic rule of film, Chekov’s Gun. In other words, set up and pay off. This rule gives a story exceptional rewatch value. In Cautious Hero’s case, I found the majority of the show repetitive and underwhelming. Even after the twist, I felt like I wasted my time. All pay off, no setup. Although I wouldn’t call the twist satisfying in any respect, it at least led to a heartfelt ending. Or maybe not quite. Without the build-up, the tear-jerker ending rang hollow. Ending aside, there are still many more problems with this show that I need to address—and the commendable ways it stands out from other isekai.<br />
<br />
(Spoilers End)<br />
<br />
The jokes are derived from Rista’s reactions to Seiya being a jackass. He annoys her with his cowardliness. What riles her up the most is his lack of care for anyone. She’s so relatable because of how frustrated she gets. Who wouldn’t be annoyed by this guy? Also, it was pretty funny how horny she was for him. Even with all the stupid stuff she does, she still tries to maintain her nobility as a Goddess. Rista is a clone of Aqua from Konosuba with slight differences. Her over-the-top personality is the highpoint of Cautious Hero. She made it worth watching the boring parts. We see the narrative from her first-person point of view, almost like she is the protagonist. Completing Rista and Seiya’s party is Mash and Elulu, two kids tagging along out of respect for Seiya. I don’t have much to say about them. One is a girl who was there to be cute. The boy acts like a standard shounen character, he is determined to Do His Best. Seiya is so overpowered that he doesn’t need a party. The other members are useless compared to him. <br />
<br />
As for the animation, Cautious Hero adopts the loose animation style of Konosuba. With this art style, the animators can get away with making the designs can look a little off-model for the sake of humor. They draw faces to look stupid a lot. When the art looks a little unintentionally bad, it’s still goofy because it rarely takes itself seriously. This style doesn’t extend to the background art or storyboards, which are both mediocre. I loved how colorful this show tried to be, but there were times colors clashed hideously. Thankfully the character designs are pretty good.<br />
<br />
Ristarte and her fellow Goddesses wear beautifully decadent outfits. Per isekai standard, they have pieces of cloth instead of bras. I liked that Seiya made fun of how impractical Rista’s outfit was rather than just letting it fly (hey DanMachi). The one design that stood out to me the most was the Goddess of war and her bikini made of chains; it suits her hostile demeanor so well. Conversely, Seiya’s character design is quite generic—it adds nothing to his personality. Where the humor shines is Ristarte’s many ridiculous faces. She is a folder of reaction gifs in the form of a character. The music is fine; I think the OP is one of Myth &amp; Roid’s weakest songs, above Isekai Shit Magician, of course. The ED is alright if you shield your eyes from the ugly CGI dance.  <br />
<br />
Cautious Hero would have been another Konosuba clone, but the ending made it slightly different. They&#039;re both self-aware isekai comedies with asshole protagonists and useless female characters. If only this show wasn’t shackled Seiya, it could have been more enjoyable. He prevents any other character from developing—yet he has even less personality than Kirito. There are one, maybe two jokes, and they&#039;re repeated over and over. If you want a watchable isekai gag comedy, this won&#039;t do.

    &quot;All according to keikaku&quot;: The Anime<br />
<br />
So remember KonoSuba where Aqua was a Goddess and she was running this whole &quot;hey reincarnate in another world and defeat a demon lord&quot;, well Shinchou Yuusha: Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru does that but makes it an industry!, that is to say Great Aqua stand Ristarte voiced by Aki Toyosaki has now been commanded to bring in a hero to save a S rank world in danger, she after many digging and jabs at other isekai animes, she picks Seiya Ryuuguuinn voiced by Yuuichirou Umehara, however he&#039;s not like most heroes, that is...he is extremely,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325025">
        almost like a sickness, cautious. So starts one wacky yet extremely cautious adventure to defeat the demon lord. In a ways it&#039;s like KonoSuba but with Aqua&#039;s and Kazuma&#039;s roles reversed or KonoSuba but on HARD MODE or you know like Dark So-<br />
<br />
So elephant in the room and that is Seiya himself, as due to his extremely OCD cautious nature you will think he&#039;ll be overpowered to keep himself from dying in an S rank world no less AND he&#039;ll trounce any villain out there and yeah he WILL he isn&#039;t cautious for nothing but much like KonoSuba but in failure or No Game NO Life and Kakegurui in gaming, it&#039;s the journey not the destination as to HOW he trounces the villains, hell at least Seiya IS well prepared and he bloody yet monotonously WORKS FOR IT unlike many isekai heroes who just gets the power and never uses it let alone, Shinchou Yuusha: Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru has one good comedy mainly revolving around Seiya&#039;s cautiousness and two Shinchou Yuusha: Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru has good world building so even if characters are an issue, Shinchou Yuusha: Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru has it&#039;s good strengths.<br />
<br />
To this end, the villains of Shinchou Yuusha: Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru holds to the same regard that Seiya&#039;s obsession with being cautious is, well considering the world he&#039;s trying to save is S Rank, this is somewhat justified. Whether it be that a villain appears at the STARTING village, to the villain thought ahead and destroyed the legendary armour. Yeah this is a nice similarity to Seiya&#039;s mentality just for the side of evil instead...BUUUUUT Seiya&#039;s cautiousness outright dominates the villains cautiousness by a country mile and half and guess what, his cautiousness gets plot depth latter down the line as to how his cautiousness came to be as well as WHY he&#039;s been always soo distant to Mash, Elulu and especially Ristarte, what else can LA say but Shinchou Yuusha Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru was ready perfectly for this to come into play, like Seiya!<br />
<br />
Comedy is subjective. So LA will say this in LA&#039;s eyes to Shinchou Yuusha: Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru comedy and that is that the comedy comes from the well-animated almost KonoSuba-like animation especially in the facial expressions of Ristarte. Shinchou Yuusha: Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru does have repetitive running gags mainly in Ristarte being the butt monkey to Seiya&#039;s cautious antics EVERY TIME and Seiya&#039;s cautiousness in itself a running gag (but yeah, it&#039;s kinda the draw to the show). BUt Shinchou Yuusha: Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru comedy does almost come from the great one liners from many of the characters, mainly Seiya&#039;s stoicism and Ristarte&#039;s crazy reactions. Also Shinchou Yuusha: Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru comedy does lure us into a false sense of repetitiveness as it does subvert itself to great effect making itself not repetitive with one little twist, LA won&#039;t spoil as that would ruin the joke of the anime itself so LA will leave it at that. Nonetheless Shinchou Yuusha: Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru greatest hidden strength is in it&#039;s comedy as &quot;repetitive as it might looks&quot;. <br />
<br />
Another strength, seeing that Seiya is the &quot;gimmick&quot; of the anime, well the &quot;main character&quot; as it were is by the by Ristarte, of course it doesn&#039;t show it but near the tail end of the anime when the BIG twist of the name is revealed, we see Ristarte as her own, essentially she becomes Aqua with some MAJOR plot relevance and man with ALL the subtle hints it aligns quite ell making for not only good character depth from the butt monkey of the anime but great plot twists and direction of the anime where it does get rather serious and dramatic for a &quot;comedy isekai&quot;. Ristarte if anything IS the main character of this anime, through and through.<br />
<br />
Ehhhh Mash and Elulu has their Deathmagla and Dragonkin Village arc so it checks out for them and they &quot;level up a bit&quot; while partying with Seiya soooo yeah, again Ristarte IS the main character so LA can give this a pass if anything.<br />
<br />
Shinchou Yuusha: Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru also dabbles with it&#039;s fanservice sometimes fanservicey from Ristarte and the Goddesses but also fan-disservice at times for comedy sakes. Nonetheless the fanservice and disservice is used to great effect to go along with the maniac comedy it has with Ristarte being the intentional victim in most of it, which isn&#039;t a bad thing, like a refined Aqua from KonoSuba.<br />
<br />
The animation done by White Fox was GREAT, from the absurdly cautious but wacked out battles, the decent character designs but even greater facial expressions from Ristarte to the decent to good background. White Fox did actually a pretty good job with Shinchou Yuusha: Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru and yeah sure Shinchou Yuusha: Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru had ONE delay due to production issues but it was just Seiya preparing a bit more to be ready perfectly.<br />
<br />
The voice cast was great and especially from Aki Toyosaki as Ristarte, she just had such range and played it with such colorful ham, she sounded like she had plenty of fun voicing her and it shows akin to Jun Fukushima role as Kazuma from KonoSuba. Yeah Aki Toyosaki definitely got LA&#039;s MVP of the anime, but even Yuuichirou Umehara as Seiya was great with his ever stoicism, Hibiku Yamamura as Ariadoa, Aoi Koga as Eruru and Rie Takaha- *ahem* Kengo Kawanishi as Mash. The voice cast was GREAT, what else can LA say but the voice cast was brilliantly ready perfectly.<br />
<br />
Hell with the production side of things, this anime had some delays but oddly enough it having delays got itself into a bit of meme as it&#039;s just &quot;Seiya is prepping&quot; when delays or recaps happened. Which for LA&#039;s review on this, LA predraft this just in case especially after New Years but also just in case finished the predraft if a surprise &quot;Finished Airing&quot; occurs outside of the actual finished date and with Shinchou Yuusha: Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru having a solid concept through and through, made the predrafting (yes LA does this) of this review fairly easy, thus LA was ready perfectly, just like Seiya.<br />
<br />
Sometimes anime falls and dies by it&#039;s loose premises, Shinchou Yuusha: Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru is not one of them and more to the point, it&#039;s one of those simple concept animes that takes itself up to an eleven and goes in strides with it&#039;s simple premise of what is essentially what happened when you get a min-maxed main protagonist and thus becomes crazy prepared to deal with everything and with an anime&#039;s setting that is S Rank and is ALSO crazy prepared, solidifies this anime&#039;s premise and core concept making it rather enjoyable watch and for an isekai at that, from Seiya centralizing on the core concept to the characters surrounding him being perfect foils and reactionary surrogates to us ESPECIALLY Ristarte, making the core cast funny characters for a comedy isekai to it&#039;s maniac&#039;d paced plot and tangents and in the more serious moments, makes us invested in them even IF we know how the result is (and sometimes don&#039;t). <br />
<br />
Shinchou Yuusha: Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru is just one of those simple concept isekai animes that goes ALL the way through with it&#039;s premise and delivers it in spades, backed up with it&#039;s production value from White Foxes ALSO manaic&#039;d almost Konosuba-eque animations, BRILLIANT and almost ad-libbed voice cast especially from Aki Toyosaki, this is definitely an isekai that should be watched and for seasonal matters, yeah it&#039;s one of LA&#039;s favourite animes of Fall 2019 if all it&#039;s pros with small flaws that has some solid defences almost eliminating those flaws are anything to go by.<br />
<br />
Ready Perfectly...

    Less isekai more of a gag show. While every season brings in a deluge of cliché isekai genre, this one surely takes the cake when it comes to comedy and ridiculous action scenes. Make sure to keep your brain in airplane mode before watching it because that is how you are going to enjoy this series. <br />
<br />
Plot wise, this anime is mediocre or below average at best. MC represents that typical mmorpg player who grinds endless hours in training/low level zone to farm experience points. What sets this show apart is the companion our mc has i.e. Rista. The goddess Rista here is truly the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320989">
        Swiss Army knife of facial expressions. Her reactions are what makes this anime complete imo and amplifies the reactive comedy that viewers seek. Overall her seiyuu Aki Toyosaki has done an amazing job. <br />
<br />
I dig the OP. MYTH &amp; ROID never fails to deliver and the catchy music is something that will definitely loved by everyone. While the ED is good, the terrible cgi definitely made it worst. I guess the studio is trying to bank into dance genre to raise hype. It was certainly a turn off for me. Others may like it. <br />
<br />
As for art, there is nothing special or ground breaking. It is similar to what other shows have offered in past. <br />
<br />
Overall I will definitely recommend everyone here to give this show a try. Rista&#039;s character and Toyosaki&#039;s voicing has definitely got me hooked to this show and I am really looking forward to next episode.

I seem to be in the minority here, but I just... yeah.<br />
When have standards fallen so low than anything remotely subverting a dead genre becomes &#039;groundbreaking&#039;? Is something really good just by virtue of making fun of something else, regardless of execution?<br />
It&#039;s not a secret that this show is heavily... borrowing... from other shows. Comparisons have risen. Defenders say &#039;but ___ doesn&#039;t have this joke or that!&#039; which only makes one wonder: if this is so good, why do you feel the need to constantly say the shows it rips off aren&#039;t as good?<br />
Given the concept and premise, I&#039;m not going to criticize this based

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321951">
        on the characters or setup itself, but rather, the execution.<br />
I&#039;m pretty easy to make laugh. I can and will enjoy all sorts of trash for what they are, too. I must say, to this show: exaggerated faces shouldn&#039;t be the peak of your comedy. What else is there? The protagonist is extremely OP and way too cautious. I mean, it&#039;s what the title says. Other than that... what else is there? The protagonist destroying the world more than the things he&#039;s supposed to save it from given his nature? I mean, yeah, it could work, and it could work pretty well, but repeating this exact same joke violates the principles of &#039;jokes become less funny with each successive repetition&#039;. You can pull the running gag tirade if you&#039;re clever about it, but this show seems to believe that the hero causing nuclear levels of destruction to make sure a slime is dead while explaining this with a deadpan expression and the goddess freaking out was hilarious the first time, and so it ought to happen every other episode the exact same way, with the exact same timing and punchlines. <br />
Comedy and horror are two sides of the same coin because they both rely on surprising the audience; with horror, you scare them and with comedy, you make them laugh. Essentially, though, to make these genres work, you have to play on expectations and keep them at the edge of their seat, and if the joke/scare is too obvious it should be because that&#039;s what the audiences look forward to as opposed to thinking &#039;oh no, they&#039;re not going to do THAT, are they?&#039;.<br />
Like I said, I&#039;m not hard to please. I&#039;ll be cackling at the most inane things, which shocked me when I realized, halfway through the fourth episode, that I smiled only then (I don&#039;t remember for what, though it was with the show, not at it). Some of the jokes had a prety good foundation, but the punchlines fell flat by virtue of being things we have seen so many, many times already. Again: if your comedy relies on some character making exaggerated expressions, then you&#039;ve failed at it. <br />
With the serious but strange and expressive but relatively level-headed duo, it&#039;s to be expected that one of them does outrageous things while the other one reacts. That&#039;s fine. The problem is, all she does is scream and wiggle around as if to distract the audience from the fact no amount of wit was put into the joke. If she&#039;s not doing this, she&#039;s doing that classic &#039;scream into the sky&#039; reaction which, quite frankly, tends to kill jokes for me more often than make them funnier. Compare and contrast to the how it&#039;s most obviously ripping off, KonoSuba, which isn&#039;t exactly guilt-free when it comes to repetitive gags but keeps finding different ways to set them up. Another show which I think suffers from the same issue is Seitokai Yakuindomo, but even that one managed to bring a surprise every now and then. Moreover, both of those shows actually made me laugh.<br />
At some point, i wondered, too, what can I actually get from watching this show? It&#039;s depressing me and it obviously has nothing else to offer beyond the attempted comedy given it falls into the trap of &#039;make everything as cliché as possible and make fun of it so people won&#039;t notice&#039; as well. I&#039;m not saying clichés are bad or that a generic premise dooms the show... unless that&#039;s all there is.<br />
Again, have our standards fallen so low that any piss-poor attempt at satire is to be applauded and defended for &#039;not being like the rest&#039;? Does something being satirical give it the excuse to be creatively dead in every aspect? There is no tension, no depth to the characters, absolutely no feature of interest when it comes to the world, no laughs, and so I must say: what else is there? Moreover, should we, as consumers, just take in whatever we can and keep feeding mediocrity on the basis that &#039;it&#039;s not AS bad as ___&#039;? <br />
Again, not saying we&#039;re bad for watching trashy shows. I watch trashy shows. I like trashy shows. I rate them relatively high unless they piss me off in some way. I don&#039;t, however, justify their trashiness. I won&#039;t get defensive if someone else doesn&#039;t like it. Why should I? Why should we?

    [Spoiler Warning.  The part I actually spoil is labeled later on, so you&#039;ll know when it happens.  But I was forced to put a full spoiler warning at the top.  I guess you can&#039;t be too... cautious... eh??  ...I hate this.]<br />
<br />
“I get it.  It ain’t making me laugh, but I get it.” --Meatwad (Aqua Teen Hunger Force)<br />
<br />
Although I didn’t enjoy it all that much, I respect how Tueeeeeeeeeeeeeee repeats its own themes of caution within the writing by explaining every single joke and detail of the story.  Even the title itself is an act of caution: ‘Cautious Hero: The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325050">
        Hero is Overpowered but Overly Cautious’, the subtitle of which is literally just a much longer and more inconvenent way of saying “CAUTIOUS FUCKING HERO”.  White Fox themselves delayed the broadcast of a couple episodes to make sure they would be of watchable quality before pulling an Arifureta in back-to-back seasons, and there was even a recap episode JUST in case you really didn’t get the plot.<br />
<br />
But what this cautious anime overlooked is that the isekai genre has been more saturated than Guitar Hero games in the late 2000’s, leaving even the bottom of the deepest barrel empty of any scraps for more uncreative literature geniuses to feast off of.<br />
<br />
Not that I think isekai is a bad trend or anything--at the risk of handing over my e1337ist anime reviewer card, I think there is a genuine amount of potential in the story concept of an “ordinary” character summoned to a fictional world where his real-world skills and logistics are tested in another dimension.  It’s not the Goddess of Isekai’s (probably some big-titted bimbo sitting up in some other-worldly realm watching me from a glass ball or some shit) fault that like 1% of people actually gave a shit about trying.<br />
<br />
And it’s not even that I crave a particularly unique or creative story to enjoy something--catch me celebrating the arrival of the Slime 300 adaptation.  But… at some point, I have to wonder “When is this going to end?  When will enough be enough?”  I’d like to think that the diarrhetic bombardment that we got from isekai last season would have dropped its stock a fair bit, but I guess now that we got one that is “acceptably not shit” immediately after, everything is hunky-dory again.<br />
<br />
Let me get to the point. Cautious Hero is an extremely typical RPG-like story, but the twist is that the main character is ridiculously over-cautious to the point where he has to kill a minimum-level monster with a much more high-level spell--dozens of times.  He spends incessant amounts of time grinding before taking on boss fights and his outlandish actions spread to NPCs.  As a result, his actions are often questioned by the world around him, including a goddess from the Divine Realm who accompanies him.<br />
<br />
Given the relationship between this goddess and the main character, the #1 comparison to this anime is KonoSuba, but I would actually say this is more similar to How To Not Summon A Demon Lord.  The reason why is because of a shared flaw: In its attempt to parody typical RPG stories, this anime becomes mind-numbingly boring to watch.  Cautious Hero features a completely recycled, by-the-numbers JRPG plot about finding a legendary sword and armor and killing the Demon Lord and its four generals.  Late into the story, the author tries throwing some high-stakes plot twists, but they’re lateral moves.  They changed things up to be slightly less generic than before, but they don’t actually make the story better--in fact, they feel more like time-wasters.  More on that later.<br />
<br />
I’m trying to think of more to say about how boring the story is, but that’s just it.  There’s nothing to say.  All I can think of is how the anime spent several episodes on this quest to a dragon village with these two slapdick NPC kids.  I get it, Cautious Hero, the joke is that these kids are traditional RPG protags and Cautious-sama is much stronger than them so they’re actually useless great job everyone.  It doesn’t change the fact that these characters are not even slightly amusing to watch.  Look, if you want to have a guy take down this big colossal threat in an unconventional way, go for it.  But pretty much all of the side characters could’ve been replaced with mannequins modeled after Mads Mikkelsen and nothing of value would have been lost.<br />
<br />
The other problem with this anime is the incredible amount of repetition, how it even repeats itself beat for beat sometimes.  Seiya goes to a new town → Seiya uses facts &amp; logic to piss off the locals →  Locals/Ristarte question his status as a hero →  Seiya goes into the god realm to get trained by a god or goddess → said god or goddess is completely mind-broken by Seiya’s OP-ness (say that out loud for maximum comedy!!!!) → Seiya ultimately defeats the big ultimate omega god threat and kind of sort of wins the locals over.  This exact process happens more than once.<br />
<br />
Aside from parodying typical JRPG elements, the other main source of comedy is from the goddess, Ristarte.  Or, rather, her having extreme overreactions to every single thing that happens on screen.  This is actually one point in favor of Cautious Hero, the handling of Ristarte as a character.  She herself claims and believes herself to be this perfect, heavenly being who graces those around her with her mere presence, but her true personality is a very short-tempered, unlikable brat who throws a tantrum when things don’t go her way.  This is where most of the KonoSuba comparisons come in as she’s almost identical in personality and role to Aqua; I can’t really deny this myself, but Ristarte is still enjoyable.  Or, at least, enjoyable with how the animators deliver her reactions.  She distorts, stretches, changes colors, her character design gets outright abused in animation with her expressions.  And even though I stopped finding her general personality enjoyable after a while, White Fox never stops the crazy train with her faces, always willing to deliver a new, bizarre expression.  <br />
<br />
For some other notes on this character, Ristarte thinks she can seduce Seiya, but instead Seiya is so magnificently handsome and brooding that she’s the one mega horny for him instead, and of course Seiya gives zero fucks about her.  It’s a pretty funny joke, but it also gets done to death by the halfway point.  Also, this might be a reach, but I like to believe that the ED is a shitty CGI dance to exacerbate her hypocrisy as this cute, endearing godess.  Because the ED itself is meant to be cute and endearing, but with such tacky animation it is anything but.<br />
<br />
The other role of Ristarte and most other characters is to loudly repeat everything that happens on screen, just in case some deaf people had it in them to watch some colorful Chinese cartoons.  I don’t necessarily mind this sort of thing all the time--characters reacting and explaining things and all that.  But CH has to do it every. single. fucking. time. Seiya does something weird, and then someone has to loudly exclaim “SEIYA DID THIS FUCKING WEIRD THING! WHAT!!!!”<br />
<br />
I specifically remember a fight where Seiya devoured a plump bag of stat-boosting seeds in one gulp.  This is a funny joke because Seiya is always a very serious, straight-faced man, and now he’s drawn in a much more comical way, with the mouthful of seeds making his cheeks puff out like a chipmunk.  Then Ristarte says out loud, “LOL he kinda looks like a chipmunk!!”  Once again, thank you to the real Cautious Heroes, the writers, for being cautious enough to make sure that I understood this 200 IQ joke.<br />
<br />
Speaking of 200 IQ, the writer(s) realized at some point that this anime isn’t actually doing anything special, so the last few episodes dish out a few plot twists.  But as I said, these are lateral moves that don’t really improve the anime.  Do they make it more surprising?  Sure, I guess.  But was the anime better because these things happened?  Would it matter if these twists were taken out in favor of a more straightforward plot?  It’s not like these twists did anything to change my perspective on the series or anything.<br />
<br />
Let me explain, and SPOILERS by the way.<br />
<br />
I’m sure the mods want me to be a little more CAUTIOUS with the spoiler warning so here you go.<br />
<br />
This section is where spoilers start.<br />
<br />
This section is where spoilers start. (x2)<br />
<br />
These spoilers spoil things that happen.<br />
<br />
Do not read the spoilers if you do not want to be spoiled on things that happen.<br />
<br />
Go to the point that says the spoilers are over if you do not want to read spoilers.<br />
<br />
Ready perfectly.  I am completely what the fuck ever.<br />
<br />
So one of the main goals of the isekai story is to find a legendary armor, because apparently all other armor is useless against the Demon King or Demon Lord or Demon God or Demon Epstein Didn’t Kill Himself or whatever.  Instead, the armor is destroyed by a boss, who sacrifices himself and a literal entire village to summon some transcendent phantom thing.  The phantom has glitched stats and all attacks cause it to multiply instead of dealing damage, and when Seiya and company retreat into the Divine Realm with all of the other goddesses, it actually follows them, because that makes a lot of fucking sense.  Ultimately, a goddess uses a big fuck-off instant kill move on it, which makes me wonder what the actual point of all this was because I’m here to watch Cautious Hero, not this bitchlord.  <br />
<br />
Weeeelll, it turns out the point is to have Seiya learn the move instead, because the penultimate episode reveals the big, mind-blowing plot twist that it’s had saved all along.  Seiya was already isekai’d before and had a pregnant gf in his party; he ultimately failed at the final boss because he wasn’t cautious enough and this girl died and reincarnated into a goddess as Ristarte.  And so Seiya has this instant-kill move that also kills him because, underneath his hard, cold demeanor, he’s a selfless and deeply caring person who is cautious at every turn because he doesn’t want to lose anyone else.<br />
<br />
Except all of this was not really that surprising, and some of it was already established from the get-go.  I’m not gonna say I had this entire backstory in my head from episode one or anything, but--wow, Seiya is really cautious because there was a time when he WASN’T cautious and he suffered from it?  Genius!  Ristarte got a restart on her life and that’s why her name is Restart, wow!  Okay, cynical comments aside, I really don’t get why Seiya is such a shit to Ristarte if this girl is supposed to be actually meaningful to him.  Even if it’s like the show implies, where he’s cold to others because he wants them to be pushed away so he doesn’t have to risk losing them, he can be a little brutal to her sometimes.<br />
<br />
And more importantly, this big reveal that deep down Seiya is actually very compassionate was already explained in one of the earliest episodes.  Seiya trains in the Divine Realm for a while instead of fighting a dangerous threat head-on, and when Ristarte berates him for it, Seiya explains that he must be as careful as he can, acknowledging that if he dies then the world is fucked.  Boom, done.  <br />
<br />
Did this backstory really need to happen?  Cautious Hero is an absurd comedy.  Did there really need to be an emotional reason for everything?  And more importantly, did I care that they bothered to add it?  Ultimately, this didn’t change my perspective on the characters or the story, and with these characters being so one-note, I didn’t have the investment in them to be hooked on this story beat.  I wouldn’t say this was necessarily a bad thing, because I would imagine someone being really into this episode if they were really into the show already, but coming from a neutral-or-worse opinion, it was a flop.<br />
<br />
End of spoilers.<br />
<br />
The spoilers have ended.<br />
<br />
You can read the next part if you skipped the spoiler section.<br />
<br />
The rest of the review does not have any spoilers.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, what draws me into Cautious Hero is the potential for an absurd story.  An extremely overpowered main character who fights bigger and badder threats each time, with a bizarre personality quirk to boot.  The early episodes did pretty well to deliver this.  But as time went on, the lack of creativity really showed.  It became too invested in telling a “real” story, and that story just wasn’t very good to begin with.  <br />
<br />
And to add insult to injury, it’s another light novel series that absolutely loves to overstay its welcome.  Although a second season hasn’t been announced as of this writing, the novels themselves continue.  There are more arcs to this story, more worlds to explore.  Seriously?  What the actual hell are they going to do from this point?  This series had literally one job: Cautious Hero kills Demon King.  Boom, done.  End of story.  Why do we need to explore more excess bullshit?<br />
<br />
One thing that slightly props up this anime is the production--the visuals are often loose, but colorful and expressive where they need to be.  Funny enough I thought Mash and Elulu, the two most pointless characters, were actually very well-designed and maybe deserved to have a real show together.  Seiya is good as far as generic, edgy-looking LN protags go, and I’m overall neutral on the designs of the gods and goddesses, although I did really like Adenela for her crazy Hex Maniac-like design.<br />
<br />
Sound-wise, the two frontline characters are well casted.  Yuuichiro Umehara, known for his role as Goblin Slayer, slips into the place of Seiya seamlessly.  Aki Toyosaki hams up her performance as Ristarte effectively--even though I got tired of her screaming after a handful of episodes, I wouldn’t blame the actress for the script. <br />
<br />
The OP is fine, but I wouldn’t listen to this song outside of this anime.  The so-called metal instrumentation is so cheaply produced that it’s like eating reheated pizza after a week.  I can fuck with it, but I’ll take the real thing instead any day.  I mentioned the ED as being fun if the intent was to be bad, so I guess you can take that as you will.  The soundtrack exists.<br />
<br />
To glaze over everything I’ve said to this point, there wasn’t a lot about Cautious Hero that was outright bad--at worst the show is tiring and repetitive and uncreative, but all of that would just be a bit disappointing instead of disastrous.  It has some highlights, especially early on.  It overall balances out to being mediocre.  Which, I guess is worth something nowadays.<br />

    Cautious Hero is one of those shows where the title just sounded more like a clickbait than actually being overly cautious because this hero wasn&#039;t that overly cautious at all; except for a couple of his decision making that does certainly put him within that category when he blows things up over and over again on the corpse of his enemies. To expand on what I just said, he&#039;s more like a dark soul player than anything. <br />
<br />
Some people may be turned off by the MC&#039;s attitude towards everyone, but as a light novel reader of this series, this series is actually a lot more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321031">
        serious than you would originally think. Though also comedic most of the time. There&#039;s actually a reason why the MC&#039;s like that as well, a very big reason. I mean, you could probably tell how messed up some of the villains are with at least the first boss killing itself, and from there, a monster crawled out from within that buff body and tore it from inside out. Somewhat reminding me of devil man cry baby for some reason. <br />
<br />
Later into the story, it will contain some of the very overly sexualize and gruesome scenes; the light novel translation had to tag the NSFW tag/warning before you could read the chapters. Your early impression of this anime could be completely be blown away by the upcoming episodes. When I said NSFW, expect there to be a lot of gore and a bit of pubic hair. Yes, I said it! Pubic hair! You will either be weirded out by this series, or find some of the things here actually being funny. With all that said, I don&#039;t personally mind that at all. It&#039;s just a series that doesn&#039;t know the boundary between something being funny, or something that&#039;s just straight up weird or messed up. As an example, episode 4 had titties spilling out.<br />
<br />
I had only finished reading up until the end of this season 1 of the light novel btw.<br />
<br />
The reason why I actually read the light novel after seeing the first episode of Cautious Hero was because it broke so many tropes with how self aware they were as they only chose people from Japan because they&#039;re more familiar with isekai tropes. Or how the Demon King knows that there&#039;s a threat, so they gave the Hero no time to train, even though they presumed that he&#039;s still level 1 at the time of his departure to the world. Meaning, if there&#039;s no time difference between the god&#039;s realm with that world, the world would have been doomed before Cautious Hero could&#039;ve came to save them.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re planning to drop this series, the twist to this show is literally gonna surprise you. Since these characters, even if you may dislike them or find some of them annoying, are not as one dimensional as you would think. It&#039;s like comparing hell to heaven. It just doesn&#039;t feel like a comedy series anymore after I finished volume 1 of the light novel.<br />
<br />
On episode 3, I&#039;m sure everyone had some trouble to either cry with laughter or depression after seeing my guy Celsius being bullied by our hero. And like I said, but let me rephrase it, the author&#039;s sense of humor is pretty interesting. And you guys may also wondered, why didn&#039;t they show the training that the Cautious Hero is doing? The answer to that is, because he&#039;s not the MC.<br />
<br />
Some people may be deceived by the title of this series, but the MC isn&#039;t the cautious hero. Some people may also put the wrong tag with the &quot;male protagonist&quot; into this series, but the entirety of volume 1, which was like 1000 pages long, was never being portrayed from the Cautious Hero&#039;s point of view. Additionally, we never get to hear the Cautious Hero&#039;s inner monologue even once. Meaning, if the Cautious Hero were to fight against the Demon King all by himself. We will never know what happened unless the Goddess was also there as well. <br />
<br />
That aside, the characters of this show isn&#039;t all that likable in my opinion, even though I&#039;ve seen the light novel. Of course, Seiya is an exception as his character is actually a lot more likable than you would&#039;ve initially thought, but aside from him and a few goddesses: Aria (a bit plain of a character that fit into a certain perfect girl trope) and everyone else are just a decent character. There is certainly quite a few character growth for the main characters and a few side characters, but generally, that kinda goes against to what a comedy anime should really be about.<br />
<br />
So here comes the problem that I have with the series. It&#039;s one of those series that started off funny, but later became too overly serious for it to even be considered as funny sometimes. The direction that the author took with this series is actually quite disappointing and surprising. Although, this should be something that should be said after episode 12 came out, but this show will be heavily depend on your preferences when the show started to show you a lot more messed up stuff as the story goes on, and as each new Demon King&#039;s bosses are introduced into the story. <br />
<br />
If you think that this is a full on comedy story, you guys are way off the mark. It&#039;s literally the epitome for a drama series, with the exposition and the early episodes, being consisted of mainly just comedy just for the attention grabber.  It&#039;s not a bad show dont get me wrong, I&#039;m still enjoying it despite what I&#039;d said.<br />
<br />
Definitely a good show to watch to kill time.

    It&#039;s not every day I find myself so damn enamoured and thoroughly absorbed in a comedy anime that hits all my right points for enjoyment value. Cautious Hero is such a fun rollercoaster of a ride from the first episode, and it only gets much more addicting and captivating as the show progresses. In more ways than one, the watcher is in for quite a surprise with this anime, it&#039;s more than meets the eye. But first, when it comes to the overall storytelling, it&#039;s simple and relatively straightforward. Takes place in the dimension of the goddess, where each of them is tasked to save

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325036">
        their own respective worlds from complete evil. Our story is set in an S-class world ruled by the demon king and his goons. We follow our two main leads. <br />
<br />
Firstly, we have Seiya, who is the overly cautious savage dude, and I don&#039;t say that lightly either. This man will literally spam ultimate level attack on a slime of all things until he deems it&#039;s entirely secure for you go on with your day. And, no, it doesn&#039;t stop at one or even five attacks. There is no chill when it comes to Seiya&#039;s careful persona, which not only brings tears to people&#039;s eyes. Because we, among others, have his roasting session, which utterly destroys you down to your every soul. More or less, he has a rude attitude, and he doesn&#039;t care about appearances. If you get in his way, be prepared to be destroyed emotionally. That said, I can&#039;t help myself but entirely enjoy his unusual quirk since it&#039;s executed brilliantly. At first glance, the standard isekai setting, and overly cautious and overpowered being the core theme seems slightly boring, but far from it. The author of the source Light Tuchihi knows which buttons to press to keep it all from stumbling. Instead just rises the elements higher to offer you more entertainment value. <br />
<br />
Oh, did I forget to mention Kazuma from Konosuba would love this man Seiya to bits? Since he gives little to no shit when it comes to genders, and will treat you like he wants you to, whether you are a male or female. I can&#039;t even begin to tell you guys how many times this man has made poor Rista (Ristarte) go through hell because of his strong personality. She is a more or less blonde version of Aqua, that&#039;s the easiest way to describe it anyway. But like the blue water goddess, Rista is another appealing and adorable addition to be held. Although she is definitely different as well. How to best put it? Rista is a lovable pervert who is in serious love with our main male Seiya. It goes over-the-top sometimes, and her reaction is crazy, so full of life and emotion. She might need to work on her approach if she wants Seiya to ever return her feelings tho. I can also sadly see not everyone will be able to appreciate Rista for perhaps that reason. <br />
<br />
Still, for me personally, her twisty and turny character adds to the appeal, and I adore her that much more as a result. Seeing Seiya and Rista relationship is one of the biggest reasons I loved Cautious Hero so freaking much. But the side cast is not bad either and adds to the fun. It&#039;s so impactful, vibrant, and, as stated previously: full of life. I have to give credits to the voice actors for nailing their role too, but especially Rista. Who is played by Aki Toyosaki, who had way too much fun with her voice. She can make all kinds of bizarre, unique, and down-right hilarious sounds. Not to mention, with that solid and fit art-style Rista&#039;s, every facial expression is pure gold. Of course, that goes for Yuuichirou Umehara playing the role of Seiya, I can feel the harmony between those two as they act away with tons of enthusiasm and spirit. In other words, the comedy is just absolutely top-notch, and each episode had my side hurting from laughing too much. It was great. You will see all kinds of visual comedy imagery you might&#039;ve thought was impossible.<br />
<br />
 As you already could possibly tell my positive vibe, artistically, it was solid and looked simply clean. It has this simple nature to it, but let me tell you that&#039;s just merely a facade to fool you. All those expressions and the spot-on execution are not something you can draw out without love and passion into your work. So studio White Fox unquestionably knocked this one out of the park and then some. Yes, the animation is no different, you will see some mesmerizing sakuga, and all action scenes looked dynamic and impactful. I had indeed go back and replay some of those moments. We had a certain risque moment with Rista where her melons where hanging in the air and dangling, and omg, that sakuga had me dying, the fluidity was insane. That&#039;s just one segment. There are so many more to properly witness yourself and be astounded or shocked. I didn&#039;t really give you a clear image representation, so I doubt this one bit won&#039;t fail to cause a massive impact positively or negatively even. If it&#039;s too much. Well, you are the judge of that.<br />
<br />
 Let me also give a short appreciation to the ending and opening song. First off, we have MYTH &amp; ROID, and you either hate or love their music. I am the latter, thankfully for me. On top, there is that cute and lovely ending song with Rista dancing by Riku Azuna. It&#039;s CGI and probably not the best you&#039;ve seen. However, honestly, you will be bopping your head left and right to the catchy tune to care much about such irregularities. Now at the core, Cautious Hero is a straightforward anime but executed its theme with great care. I mean, think about it for a moment, our main is isekai&#039;d, and the world is more or less the same as all those other shows out there which are cut from the same cloth. The story revolves around the theme of a hero who is very overpowered and a world that needs saving to boot. But instead of staying true to the core till the end, Cautious Hero twist and turns to truly leave you shocked. It&#039;s hard to not dive into spoilers. However, essentially by the end, you might find yourself overly emotional and crying tears of a waterfall.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s one of the big reason why Cautious Hero differentiates from other anime with the same setting and genre. It doesn&#039;t play inside of the box, but also outside to make sure every watcher is thoroughly engrossed and captivated. That way, this normally simple idea starts to feel complex and lets you add to the story is unique and exciting ways. Whatever the case may be, Cautious Hero has my seal of approval for being an outright stunning comedy. And a great anime all around that is not afraid to subvert viewers&#039; expectations or stomp all over our feelings. You will unquestionably have a great and emotional time watching this anime. Now I can only cross my fingers in anticipation of a much-deserved sequel. I need one badly. At one point, I have to also pick up the light novel. If you especially love KonoSuba, then I can almost guarantee you will have a blast with Cautious Hero. This is positively one of the best Isekai anime I have personally watched in recent years, and I highly recommend it to everyone.

    You’ve probably heard this one before. Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last few years, isekai anime tends to run like an assembly factory. The product may be different but the fundamentals remain similar with a protagonist being summoned to another world by some divine entity. Their objective usually involves with saving a world and in this show, that’s no different at first. Except for one curious fact: he is overpowered and overly cautious.<br />
<br />
Meet Seiya Ryuguin, an overly powered protagonist hero but with an extremely cautious personality. Watching his character in the show equates to observing a perfectionist trying to be absolutely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325029">
        perfect in every way possible. Don’t believe me? Watch the first few episodes and it’s clear that Seiya plans everything accordingly to the finest detail. The show loves to run gags with an absurd amount of humor and portrays Seiya as a serious but prudent individual. Joining alongside him is the main female protagonist, Ristarte, the summoner who bought Seiya into her fantasy world.<br />
<br />
Compared to Seiya to Ristarte is like apple and oranges. Seiya is much more than your average isekai protagonist while Ristarte is portrayed as a comical goddess. She brings humor everywhere she goes thanks to her naïve personality and is a novice than a divine entity. It is somewhat of a deconstruction of the isekai genre with the main protagonists’ roles switched around. The anime actually adapts this gag in overly cartoonish ways especially with their character reactions. Ristarte is the biggest culprit as every episode makes her look like a fool. She reminds me of a Saturday morning cartoon character rather than a comical goddess. Honestly, once you get to know Ristarte, you can watch the show with an easy mind. Her character is not to develop but rather sell as a comedy symbol of the show itself. If you enjoy a great deal of cartoonish humor, then this anime will be a treat.<br />
<br />
But if a concrete plot is what you’re seeking, then prepare for a degree of disappointment. Many episodes revolves around with similar ideas except with different enemies. It follows the trend of Seiya preparing for every mission he takes; buying armor, supplies, advancing skills, etc. Even the more noticeable enemies follows this trend with their overly preparedness against the hero. There’s little importance to the storytelling itself once you get more into the show. In fact, you can probably watch this anime and skip some scenes without missing a beat. The parts you should pay attention to is the character chemistry between the two main leads. They are the centerpiece of the show and wants you to focus your eyes on them. And I do mean this more than just how much fan service she throws at us.<br />
<br />
It is pretty safe to say that Seiya and Ristarte are what carries the show together. Most of the supporting cast are just there to advance the weekly plot with their character roles. Ariadoa, the goddess of sealing, is portrayed as a much more respectful character than Ristarte. On the contrary is Valkriye, a goddess with an aggressive attitude but does respect Seiya despite her personality. Other goddess such as Adenela and Mitis adds additional humorous elements that you’ll have to really come to accept if want to enjoy the series. The antagonists of the series, known as the Gaeabrande demons, are the main obstacles for our hero and even they cannot escape the amount of humorous gags. The fights often look exaggerated with inevitable outcomes from both sides’ point of view. Of course, you have Seiya fighting in his overly cautious style while the demons go all out to stop him. Ristarte adds the popcorn entertainment moments with her background commentary and absurdly cartoonish reactions. When you have all these elements coming together at once, then we have this isekai anime that can be best described as a fantasy parody.

    This was certainly different haha. But different for good reasons.<br />
<br />
After seeing a few anime in which a hero that&#039;s summoned to a new world, you&#039;d think it&#039;d get boring or die off. But no, this does it differently in so many ways. Being that it&#039;s comedic touch has really gotten a number of laughs out of me. Along with the awesome anime opening that I&#039;ve listened to a number of times now.<br />
<br />
The characters are charming in their own right. Being that they are real opposites of each other, and I feel like that meshes so well together. From the hero always making sure he is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321143">
        ready for combat, to the goddess who thought this was going to be a nice and simple ride. But it&#039;s turned out like this and it&#039;s brilliant.<br />
<br />
Defo one of my favorites if not my personal favorite of this season. You should give it a watch!

    You&#039;re probably better off just rewatching konosuba. They&#039;ve repeated the same  &quot;gag&quot; multiple times every episode and as we all know: if a joke was funny the first time, it&#039;ll be even funnier the twelfth. The mc is just a generic op protag except with some wacky twist that will somehow make the show not inane garbage. Kemono Michi(another show this season) also has an op protag, but they make his wacky twist actually change the plot from standard isekai. Watch this if you&#039;re the kid of person who has watched every episode of family guy and still finds it funny.

    I was looking forward to this to get my Isekai fix, and so far it’s been a bit of a mixed bag. Cliché alert: goddess summons hero to help save the world. She finds perfect OP hero candidate with ridiculously high stats that it seems he can easily crush the demon lord that threatens the world. The only issue is that he is unimaginably cautious to the point of idiocy. Think Saitama who uses a serious series move on a lowly minion, or Ainz using high tier magic to kill a single puny human. <br />
<br />
I find the narrative interesting so far, it’s not original by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320971">
        any means, but at least it shows off the MC’s overpowered overkill nature in kind of a refreshing new way, given that the OP MC story has been beaten to death with all the previous Isekai. The introduction of his cautious nature feels like a bit of fresh air, and makes the show embrace its comedic elements. It never takes itself too seriously and it’s pretty hilarious, though I must admit some of the jokes gets repeated and gets a bit stale. The true MC here is the goddess, she kind of carries this show and the actual hero is more or less like a prop that supports her. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s some time spent on introducing the characters which slowed the pace down a bit, but at least we get some understanding of the characters’ quirks. The animation and visuals are good – it’s not really great but not shabby either. The voice acting is where this show shines through – it’s very impressive, with phenomenal vocal performances. It’s mostly fun and elicited a lot of laughs during the first few episodes. Overall this is a good show with a fun start, and I hope it stays as enjoyable or improve for the rest of the season.<br />

    I HATE GENERIC ISEKAI!<br />
<br />
<br />
This is me, when i see the poster and that long title.<br />
First, lets see the title: Shinchou Yuusha or Cautious Hero. Doesn&#039;t this title like your generic isekai title, right?<br />
Second, lets see the poster: A Kirito guy with his sword and those female who showing her boobs (partly). Hmmm seems like SAO with fanservice scene, right?<br />
<br />
BUT?! why the hell i give 9 for this show?!! Am i trash taste weeb or just trolling you? Now, Are you ready perfectly to see my review? okay let&#039;s go!<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
Great story ever! EH?! WHY?<br />
I was wrong dude! This is not your generic Isekai.<br />
<br />
Adventure with a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325354">
        goddess? And that MC always likes to pissing off that goddess? Sound like Konosuba for you, right? You are right!<br />
<br />
Similar to Konosuba, every episode in this show have solid comedy.  Even this show likes to sarcasm your another generic isekai. And also, this show have good drama too. oh, i advice you to notice some hints in every episode beside you can laugh for MC&#039;s over cautiousness jokes. If you notice those hints, you will more enjoy and more excited to watch this show. Imagine Konosuba with drama, seems good right?<br />
<br />
Art (7/10)<br />
Do you know White Fox? Do you know Gochiusa and Re:Zero? Of course the art will be good for your eyes! and the bonus is this show gives you a full of funny expression. Seems interesting to you? Of course this is a comedy show!<br />
<br />
But, unfortunately, this one have some flaw in my eyes. And i hate the art in this ending song.<br />
<br />
Sound (10/10)<br />
Ready Perfectly!<br />
Do you know Goblin Slayer&#039;s voice? Kinda cool to you?<br />
Do you know Yui&#039;s (K-on) voice? Kinda cute and funny to you?<br />
Lucky! i can hear my favorite VA in this show!<br />
<br />
Oh i love the opening song too!!! very catchy to my ears! I never skipped this show&#039;s opening!<br />
<br />
Character (9/10)<br />
MC kinda like your Kirito? Right!<br />
But, this one have good character development story! really touchy for my heart!<br />
And those female? they are goddess, but are you sure they have good personality traits like your generic isekai?<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10)<br />
I rated Konosuba 10/10, of course i will enjoy this too! both of them never make me yawn.<br />
<br />
Overall (9/10)<br />
Wanna prove this show never makes you yawning? Go watch this show by yourself. Luckily, you can watch this freely and legal in youtube at Muse Asia! (But, only for south east asian region, then if you can&#039;t watch this, i advice you to use VPN)<br />
<br />
Me at the first didn&#039;t plan to watch this because this seems like your generic isekai!<br />
But at the end, your first impression is really wrong just like me.<br />
So, if your first impression and final impression like mine, why you didn&#039;t click &quot;helpful&quot; button for my review?

    Well, this is actually a pretty good show. It feels a bit like konosuba since it is an isekai parody.<br />
Well, the story is pretty basic for and isekai. The hero gets summoned to the &quot;Gods realm&quot; and then our hero is tasked on killing the demon lord. But our hero seiya is very cautious. He was gifted with abnormal starting stats. He started the show with training to increase his stats even further beyond rather than going straight into the new world to destroy monsters. Due to his cautious nature he spams spells a lot just to be sure he destroys a monsters, he used

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322071">
        like 10 spells to destroy a slime. <br />
Characters: We have our mc Seyia who is super broken but still very cautious so he spends a lot of time training to beat a simple foe. Why? Just because he has to be sure that he will be able to kill them. <br />
Ristarte is the aqua of this show, another useless goddess. She can heal and open portals to the god realm. She is probably the funniest character in this. Her facial reactions are always beautiful. <br />
Elulu is a half dragon who is very adorable but currently works as seiyas bag carrier so there is not much for her character.<br />
Mash/Mushroom is also a half dragon who can transform into a lizardman increasing his stats. There is not much know about this character but he likes to act tough even though he is not.<br />
The music in this show is pretty darn good. The opening is a banger.<br />
Do I recommend this anime? Yes I do. It is pretty funny.

    “ Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot. ” - Charlie Chaplin<br />
<br />
Cautious Hero is an isekai comedy that was never meant to be taken serious. Far from being overpowered, the hero is overly cautious in preparation no matter how weak the opponent seems to be. If there&#039;s a comparison to be done, he&#039;s that guy in the group that brings two umbrellas, a raincoat, two pair of clothes and a hat to the beach in a sunny day that was confirmed twice by weather forecast.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s ridiculous. It&#039;s silly. It&#039;s entertaining. It&#039;s almost everything anyone could have thought of, combining

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325787">
        the cliché jokes and moments with various over-the-top facial expressions from Rista and her voice actor that seems like having way too much fun. Then, there&#039;s the calm and composed Seiya with no reactions and no feelings whatsoever.<br />
<br />
With this duo, what could possibly go wrong?<br />
<br />
S-rated demon underlings that is both way unpredictable and powerful, two dragon-descendant party members that have little to no power, a goddess that is worth lesser than medicine herbs and legendary weapons seemingly out of reach. This isekai defies many of the unspoken laws that governs the world of isekai, and within every step, it makes fun of it.<br />
<br />
The way the words are expressed with the emphasis on action becomes the embodiment of comedy in this show. This is repeated and applied into many different scenarios under various mood that the Hero is under. And even so, the laughs are never-ending with Rista around here. And I think that&#039;s the beauty of it. On what she meant for him.<br />
<br />
As it all links together, this comedy show evokes something that I never thought was possible with its premise. It makes it far better, and valuable to be seen. It takes the story, the reasoning to a whole new level.<br />
<br />
In the end, it all makes sense. <br />
<br />
Cautious Hero is a comedy when see afar, but look closer, and you&#039;ll discover the hidden beauty of its tragedy.<br />

    Well, After watching episode 11 <br />
i deleted my previous review and this is the new one<br />
<br />
Re-watching this anime will not be the same after this episode...<br />
<br />
1-10 episode it&#039;s-Pure Comedy <br />
<br />
(has some great laugh out loud moments The humor, the facial expressions and the voice acting is glorious)<br />
<br />
and then 11th episode airs and &quot;Welcome to the dark side&quot;<br />
...Curse you onion ninja...<br />
<br />
The anime at first look can be consider only a parody or average isekai has a deep backstory and actually explains why the character is so cautious with out spoiling anything i would say it&#039;s a solid watch<br />
<br />
9/10 recommended  <br />

    Well damn, this was one hell of a gag show. This anime takes quite a unique twist on isekai. Very entertaining and more of a comedy than anything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story 8/10:<br />
Like I said&#039; the story puts a unique twist on the normal Isekai plots we see in generic anime or even manga. The goddess of healing, Listarte, is tasked with saving a fantasy world from it&#039;s demon lord, the only problem is that the world has a difficulty rank of S which is the highest you can get. Luckily the goddess finds a perfect hero to summon, Seiya Ryuuguuin. He has incredible stats and abilities compared

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321012">
        to any other potential hero. But the only issues is that Seiya is impossibly cautious. The thing that sets this Isekai apart other than the nature of the protagonist is the way he progresses, training for days on end in the starting village and making minimal progress unless he is sure 110% he can pull of a victory.<br />
<br />
Art  9/10:<br />
Visually the art of the show is quite appealing . The show is filled to the brim with bright fantasy like colors which compliments the style of the show as well as the atmosphere it gives off. This coupled with great looking character designs for almost every character and you have quite a good looking show.<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10:<br />
The sounds in this show seem to be quite dull in my opinion. I hardly notice the music that is is playing in the background unless there is a big fight going on. The OP and ED is quite good though and fit the series well.<br />
<br />
Characters 9/10:<br />
The characters in the show are really well done and show a lot of personality. We have the goddess who is cute looking and quite a good goddess at first, well until we see what she is really like. Her facial expressions and reactions to what characters do are hilarious and pinpoint accurate for her character and she can be a typical protagonist at times. And we have our other protagonist, Seiya, who has a unique personality. He is, as the title implies, overly cautious. He is a character that fits the series amazingly well and a really cool MC that follows the Isekai character style, black hair and dark eyes, but has a twist of him being buff and tall with a good looking dace instead of the same face as literally everyone else. This makes it so that you hardcore NEETs can project yourself into the MC but can also enjoy watching him as an anime character like you should be. Most other characters are just supporting ones and don&#039;t make too much of an appearance.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8/10:<br />
I honestly enjoyed this show a whole damn lot. The character interactions and plot developments are all funny and most made me genuinely laugh. It is really fun to watch, Every episode lasted 25 minutes but in my mind was over in about 5.<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10:<br />
Not a masterpiece by any stretch of the word but still a must watch this season. I recommend this to every person who likes anime.<br />

    (Anime and Season 1 review only, so please don&#039;t massacre me if it gets better)<br />
<br />
While I&#039;m rating this show 6, I still gonna say that this is a must show.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Because its a very good show. While I am rating this show a 6 should not discourage you from at least checking out a couple episodes. Especially if you like Konosuba you&#039;ll probably like this show too, because it has a very similar style of comedy. <br />
<br />
But.<br />
<br />
If you despise sudden ass pull drama that does feel rather forced (I&#039;m looking at you &quot;Sora Yori no Tooi Basho&quot;) and it doesn&#039;t make any senses, like wtf was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325319">
        that? What&#039;s the point of pulling all of this sad shit? If we don&#039;t even give a fuck about the characters (well at least for me, because everyone seems like they got hit by a bus). It could have been better if they at least a little more hints/foreshadowing, but no they suddenly pull this shit without even having a decent amount of character development. It just happened too fast, that it left a very bitter taste in me. So basically it was rushed to death, it will probably have a very different result if it has a little more time (20+ episodes) to flesh out the characters. If I have a very imaginable comparison to this tragedy, I would saw this is probably what would happen to Gintama if it has a very limited amount of episodes.<br />
<br />
But still, it is a genuinely enjoyable show if you&#039;ll just want something to watch while your brain is turned off.<br />
<br />

    Cautious Hero is one of the best isekai I have ever seen in fall 2019. It made me realize that isekais aren&#039;t as bad as I thought. I just try to hide that fact by covering it with criticisms and people&#039;s negative thoughts. In reality, I don&#039;t even think that isekais are bad. They&#039;re just another form of trash like Harem or Ecchi. <br />
<br />
I won&#039;t make this review long. So I&#039;ll just conclude right away. Cautious hero is very fun and very relatable. I&#039;ve played RPG games before and I know what it&#039;s like to be overly cautious and the reason of why I have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325003">
        to be overly cautious. This show was like watching a side of me play an RPG game until the end. It was an amazing experience. I also lowkey cried sometimes in which is something that rarely happens when I watch an isekai. <br />
<br />
One negative thing about is show is that it seemed a bit rushed. It feels too fast. But I didn&#039;t really bother because I had many other anime to watch and seeing one that feels rushy but good is not a big of a problem. <br />
<br />
I was going to give this an 8/10 but I&#039;ll just give it 9/10 because I&#039;m generous. If you like isekai then you should watch it. It&#039;s pretty fun.

    Another isekai parody that we know well and love...<br />
If you liked Konosuba, in particular it&#039;s eccentric characters, then you will probably love this too. If you don&#039;t like silly comedy isekai&#039;s then I suggest you check the genre tags in the future.<br />
<br />
While Konosuba focused on a parody via realism: with money problems, weakness and plenty of misunderstandings; Cautious Hero focuses on a parody via caution despite power. Rather than confidently waking into a battle to have some Death Note-like strategy that all goes according to plan, Cautious Hero gives us a hero that repeatedly blows up where a lvl 1 slime once was with Megumin

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321353">
        level explosions just in case a few particles of its corpse remains.<br />
<br />
Just like with Konosuba, don&#039;t expect some amazing background story. It&#039;s really just a classic isekai scenario with a demon king and his minions trying to take over a fantasy world. It&#039;s simply just a fun character comedy done right.
