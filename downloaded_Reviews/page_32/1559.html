ok so finally after 2 years wait the movie all fairy tail fan boys and fan girls were waiting for is out .... 2 years ago Hiro Mashima made a picture showing Natsu as half dragon and he said that a movie based on this picture will come , we all know mashima is a man of his word and finally the movie which is said to give the biggest fairy tail shockers ( said my mashima sensei himself ) is here .<br />
<br />
Now as we know that Ft 2014 ended with the disbanded Fairy Tail guild so how come the guys are back again

        together , well the story of the movie is based in the time after  Avatar arc which was in the manga and not shown in the anime , during that arc natsu lucy gray erza and wendy gather together to bring the guild back , that is why the guys are back together again , its better if you read the manga till there , its a short arc but if you dont wanna its not a problem , all you need to know is gray and erza were working undercover  to bust out an organization of worshippers of zeref , natsu due to a reason ( a spoiler which i dont wanna give ) ended up to bust that organization too that is how all they come together , during this wendy and juvia were also accompanied by them .<br />
<br />
the story of this movie is based on dragons and secrets regarding dragons that we didnt knew before it would be better if you watch it rather than me telling you so , and its based in another city with a new king which aids our heroes and help them fight dragons due to a certain reason ( a spoiler which i dont wanna give ) . like the previous movie this movie also features another main character , a female warrior of the empire who journey with natsu&#039;s team . Naturally the main part of the story would be spoilers that is why i wont discuuss them here .<br />
<br />
The character design this time is changed , i would say i prefered the previous one but its not bad this time either , the art and graphics is as awesome as it always was and the voice actors are the same as they were.<br />
Gladly we will get to see the transformation of natsu into a half dragon as he awakens a new power . To all the Nalu fans there is good news as Hiro Mashima has done quite alot of work on Nalu power in the movie so rejoice   <br />
( i am a lisana fan though ) . <br />
<br />
Overall its a great movie based on 142 pages from the original story board created by Mashima sensei and another great piece of work which you all can expect on alot . Personally Fairy Tail is the best anime i have ever seen and i am one of the biggest fan ( trust me when i say this , my profile and my room is a proof of it ) but to all those who are not die hard fans i assure you , you will also like this .... <br />
<br />
i hope it helped :)

    Warning: I am still fresh of seeing this movie. I watched it two weeks ago. Before I give my overall review let me tell you that I will be comparing this movie to other recent shonen movies to get my point. <br />
<br />
This will also spoil some major plot points<br />
<br />
This is one of the worst movies I ever had the displeasure of watching.  As someone who still watches Fairy Tail from the start until now that it only has 8 chapters left I was pissed. And this is coming from a fan that has stood with Fairy Tail even if it has had one of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249177">
        the worst downgrades I have ever seen since I read the last two arcs of bleach.<br />
<br />
Story [1.5]<br />
The only reason I am giving this a 1.5 instead of a 1 is that that of the first 10 minutes. That is the only part that is enjoyable in my opinion and it becomes a giant mess. The sheer number of things that fail from its villain to its own heroes is outstanding. It has absolutely nothing that makes me excited to talk about with someone. Oh yeah and remember how it was supposed to connect to the series? Well then I hope you are ready to sit for the whole movie and the credits to let use see a final scene that is supposed to connect on the last arc of fairy tail and make you excited for what there is to come but miserably fails instead making you enraged if you have read the final arc due to it connecting absolutely nothing. Oh yeah and remember the Natsu dragon form that is in every promotional material. Well be ready to see it almost not used and it only appears for 1:30 minutes. In comparison One Piece Movie Gold is an actual better movie at exciting you for the future of One Piece. It connects in a way of showing you what previous characters are doing and expands on the promise of them returning without the manga or anime having it doing it better than this sorry excuse for a movie. <br />
<br />
Art and Animation [2]<br />
This is easily one of the worst animated garbage that A1 pictures have thrown into the big screen. It shows that almost no time and effort was put into the fight scenes and the fight choreography makes it seem that no one at the studio has watched a decent fight scene. I would compare this movie with the masterful Koe no Katachi but that this thing could ever compare to this masterpiece of a movie would be an insult to both Kyoto animation and the people that actually work hard in the anime industry.And it is so bad that halfway through the movie I was nodding my head in disappointment in how can something be so bad that EROMANGA SENSEI a slice of life show. Has better animation than a goddam movie with a MOVIE BUDGET. The only thing that is pretty nice to look at are the character designs but it even screws up with that. At the end of the Movie they cannot even make A MOTHERFUCKING DRAGON look nice. It looks horribly designed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound [2]<br />
You have heard this already. It is the same as the anime. Nothing new.<br />
<br />
Character [2]<br />
Oh boy does this make me angry. Lets start with the original cast.<br />
Natsu- Kills the dragon, that is it. Seriously he doesn&#039;t grow in any way, shape, or form. I already hated natsu enough before seeing this movie but now they ruin the litte character that he was supposed to be and just turn him into a blank sheet.<br />
Lucy- I hate her so goddam much in this movie. She was already so bad in the original material but this is just sad. If you ver wanted to see how a character can fall so low that it matters less than dirt at this point look no further than Lucy Heartfillia.<br />
Grey, Erza, Wendy- Gonna add them all here since they do the same thing. Nothing. Defeat disposable henchmen 1, 2, and 3 and then do nothing for the rest of the movie.<br />
Juvia, Gajeel, Levy- They matter as much as the dirt that is Lucy in this movie.<br />
The cats- Appear for two scences. Try to be funny and fail miserably as always.<br />
<br />
Now we get into the original characters. <br />
Dissposable Lucy clone- I think her name was Sonya or something. I don&#039;t know. She made such little impression on everyone that she gets kicked out of the final third of the movie.<br />
<br />
Villans- Does someone even remeber what they were callled again? I sure don&#039;t. They are boring and patetic. Their powers are not even intersesting. How can you make A MOTHERFUCKING DRAGON the most boring thing in the movie I don&#039;t know.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment [1]<br />
Watching paint dry gets out more emotion than this movie<br />
<br />
Overall [2]<br />
Wanna wate ten bucks? Burn them instead of watching this movie. It wastes less time of your life than watching the epidemy of the worst things anime has to offer. <br />
<br />
Edit: Screw it it is a 1. Not even deserving of a 2. <br />
<br />
<br />

    (i will make spoilers if there will be one)<br />
<br />
I went to see this in the cinema and was so stoked as i needed my next FariyTail fix as the previous arc seems like it had ended far to long ago. So as for seeing some of my favorite anime characters in motion again it was great but unfortunately thats where the praise seems to slow down. <br />
<br />
The first part of the movie is pure ecchi fan service that i do personally like but i know many are not a fan of it so to see it so prominent in most of the first part and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247975">
        scattered through out the moive could leave a bad taste in some mouths (no pun intended). The story was very very rushed and had the team hopping from scene to scene with out reason. for example (possible mild spoiler here so be careful) when Natsu had to find the FT team as the where split up he simply said he was going to find them and then it cuts to the next scene and they are all there with no explanation of how they met up again or anything. It felt very strange and not smooth at all. As for the bad guys they where not very exciting (Spoiler Ahead) the fights with them where bland and they tried to do the whole being defeated until a smart twist with Erza but it was so lame and rushed it really annoyed me. <br />
<br />
The NaLu relations did how ever get a little deeper so for you NaLu fans like me that is a plus. Oh and the biggest secret/development in the series so far that was teased was not all that great to im sure most FT fans already know about it for ages now. I just really hope this rushed style is not the direction for the rest of FT because i did feel it was a series with some of the most developed characters ever and i could ruin it.

    I think there are two perspectives that should be addressed when reviewing Fairy Tail; the objective/intelectual/elitist view, and the subjective/fanbase view. I&#039;ll start with the Elitist review because that&#039;s more fun; but please read both for more context. (The only spoilers included are vague, disjointed and should not be enough to actually /spoil/ any scene.)<br />
<br />
<br />
                  Highly Elite Intellectual Score of Objectiveness:    1.5<br />
     This movie as garbage. Its full of plotholes, doesn&#039;t follow up on most of the what it introduces, is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255785">
        incredibly inconsistant with its characters, and backtracks over so many details its ridiculous. Every part of the setting, every new character introduced, every power and plot angle used seems thrown into the script in order to support a specific semi-cool image or moment that the director wanted in the film. <br />
<br />
     Here are a few random problems with the anime:<br />
    The enemies were poorly handled. The Lucky Stars, the stock enemy trio, were there only to delay the main party so Natsu could face the head honcho alone. They had so little significance and power, they were never even refered to by name after they introduced themselves. Their boss the arch nemesis of the movie, set up as a powerful dark arts user, doesn&#039;t even get a final battle.<br />
    The main enemy&#039;s coverstory for wanting the staff - to stop the island exploding - is never treated as a genuine concern by any of the main cast; and once the villain&#039;s true motives are revealed, the film never even bothers to clarify whether the explosive crystals are actually a problem or not. Who knows; the entire island could go BANG five seconds after the movie ends.<br />
     Inconsistant difficulties. Halfway through; a fire mage, and melee dancer and a weak guy on a fast ball (???) wipe out the party of five Fairy Tail mages. One of this party of Fairy Tail mages powers up by eating fire, one creates slippery surfaces and cages, and a third can summon armour to go very fast /and/ has a junior mage who can speed her up further. Really, these guys posed no threat. In other news, that 12 story tower now reachs the sky, the dragon transformed even without the staff, and hey look! That guy got mad; so now that gaping hole in his stomach doesn&#039;t affect his ability to move at all!<br />
     And there are many, MANY more issues.<br />
<br />
     On the whole; this is like watching an entire arc of Fairytail in 100 minutes: and yes, that means that ALL those weird side characters and new powers and cameos are included but NOT the explanation for how they actually contribute. Instead they just... don&#039;t contribute. They&#039;re just there.<br />
     This would be an ideal film to watch with a bunch of intellectual friends who are somewhat familiar with FairyTail - maybe tried watching a few dozen episodes on their own - just to rag on it. Plus (one thing they did well) there are several moments of pretty dang fine fanservice. So that&#039;s always fun to laugh about. Its also one of the few reasons this gets a 1.5 rating.<br />
<br />
<br />
              Happy-go-lucky rating from a fan with subjective tastes: 7<br />
     This film was pretty fun to watch. Many of my favourite characters had a least a few minutes of screentime and a funny quip or two; and it was nice to see them working both individually and together when they happen to bump into eachother. Some of the new powers were interesting, and the new element Stellanium could make for a pretty cool upgrade for Erza&#039;s armoury. The twist at the end, revealing the true reason for the plot of the film, was pretty interesting and didn&#039;t aim for any unneeded shock factor.<br />
<br />
     Here are a few random things I liked about the film:<br />
    The new female characters were all quite interesting, each in their own way. Sonya was an ally in a tough situation that I sympathized with; plus she had an intriguing backstory and abilities that I wish had been explored more. Riana looked like a total badass; I&#039;d have loved to see her in an actual combat scenario. Swan - the leader of the Three Stars - was incredibly attractive, and her dancing combat style was quite unique and fun to watch.<br />
    More Politics! More Dragons! More /History/!!!! Seeing the new country and learning a bit about its economy and royalty made me very curious about many things. How are these kingdoms communicating? Do the royal families of Fiore and Stella meet together with the magic council? Do they have their own wizard saints or guild systems? And the flashback to Acnologia and the other dragons was an insight into the end of the Dragon Age that we haven&#039;t had nearly enough of! Altogether, the movie made me very interested in the realms, heroes and notable treasures that must be strewn throughout the rich history of the 400 years of human occupation on the continent!<br />
    Lastly; the teaser at the end, showing new abilities for Acnologia and teasing at future conflicts made me quite excited for the final season airing next year. I&#039;m now motivated to power through the last 30 episodes that I have yet to see so I can be ready to catch the finale as it airs.<br />
<br />
     On the whole; the movie was a fun little look into a bit of what Fairy Tail is up to while rebuilding our interest and general hype for the final season. It was good to see some of favourite goofballs back in action; a highly enjoyable spectacle.<br />
     I recommand that any current FairyTail fans watch this movie. It&#039;s a pity that it didn&#039;t have more time to elaborate much on the many interesting concepts and characters it included, but it is truly in tune with the FairyTail franchise spirit of fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
     To close out this review; I&#039;d like to explain why I give it a five. Yes, to a technicion this film can be nothing but trash, and yes, to many diehard fans it may be worth a much higher score. But! I write this assuming that you are a reasonable person on neither extreme who can still have fun despite noticing many flaws, so I weigh the enjoyment rating more than the technical. I think a mediocre 5 is a fairly accurate assessment of how much I enjoyed my movie-going experience - I&#039;ve seen many better films, but it was far from being a disappointing waste of an evening.<br />
     I recommend seeing this with friends who feel the same way about Fairy Tail that you do. The less you enjoy the movie, the more you&#039;ll be able to enjoy your friends company; and the more you enjoy the movie - well, there ya go; happiness points acquired by default.<br />
     I hope this review helped you, or at least entertained you for a few minutes. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
    PS there&#039;s a scene where a bunch of female captives flee a prison, and given that the only captives we knew were a secret service swordswoman and a powerful celestial magic user, we can assume the rest had similarly strong backgrounds. That could have been one of the most hilariously badass escapes in the history of cliche anime prison breaks. Its a real pity it was squandered :/<br />
<br />
    PPS This was my first review here on MAL; lemme know if there&#039;s anything you particularly liked/disliked. k thx bai

    Fairy Tail Dragon Cry is absolute trashy film ever i watched &amp; sequel to Phoenix Nonsense..... Literally being an Shonen Fan, my friend recommended FT to me since 2009. Fairy Tail isn&#039;t especially good but definitely relies on it&#039;s fan service to keep afloat of the other competitors in it&#039;s genre every now &amp; always against esp. One Piece &amp; get big blow from High School DXD.<br />
<br />
Hiro Mashima is second to Tite Kubo in terms of Worst Writer Ever. He always uses art designs &amp; Ideas of One Piece for his FT Plot lines .....NAKAMA POWER......Sorry to All as it is Canon Film &amp; disgrace

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272996">
        to Shonen Films like DBZ Films, Naruto &amp; OP Films..........2017 Pokemon I Choose You was 1000X Better than this trash<br />
<br />
Movie (100%) divided into 10% Stupid Fights, 5% Nakama Values, 15% Stupidity Plot &amp; 70% Fanservice<br />
<br />
Plot : Horrible execution with disgusting plot on Stone called Dragon Cry<br />
<br />
Art: Decent, BUT Don&#039;t get me wrong, seeing Natsu go into Dragon Form was cool, but honestly it could have been infinitely better if same with plot.<br />
<br />
Sound: Enjoyable<br />
<br />
Character: Cliched as ever<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I feel like who ever directed this movie just everyone to see how well they can sexualise everything, to add onto this, it has more plot holes than a sponge called plot. My Thoughts of Watching this film was because it was written by Author of FT Hiro Mashima who was inspired from God of Shonen Akira Toriyama &amp; Naruto Author Kishimoto for their Success on Canon Films like Blockbusters Battle of Gods, Resurrection F, The Last &amp; Boruto etc but Hiro Mashima failed what he was lacking while writing his story &amp; end up as disappointment as ever. <br />
<br />
Overall: Neither of the Fairy Tail films offer anything to the entire story, nor does it apply any value to your life whether you are a die-hard fan or otherwise. This movie, is absolutely garbage, and as a Fairy Tail Fan, I am willing to save all others the pain and tell you to skip this film. Avoid it like the black plague, and forget it ever existed.<br />

    This is my first review..I hope it can be helpful for all.<br />
Hiro is one of the best manga artists I had ever seen.Fairy Tail has been one of the best and favorite anime that I had ever watched. Finally after all this time Dragon Cry has English subbed. Am excited to talk and review this movie.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
The story is also about dragons but set in another new city. Just like the first movie, the movie also features a young female character ( I think her name was Sonya). She also joins team Natsu to fight the dragon ( Don&#039;t want to talk more to not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264827">
        spoil the enjoyment). Although the story was quite good, I found it abit boring in half of the movie.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
What got me disappointed is the new art of Fairy Tail. Fairy tail has wonderful and realistic colors through out the show and through the 2014 episodes. But what I did not like is the weird colors of most of the characters. The characters seem somehow dull to me through out the movie. I would prefer if these types of colors would not be used again in the upcoming season of Fairy Tail. Let us hope so!<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
Fairy Tail&#039;s theme music is my ringtone right now! The music and soundtrack used in fight scenes and throughout the whole movie are just the same. One of my favorites!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
What mostly made me love fairy Tail and start watching it are the characters. They are always interesting with many stories about them, but still in this movie there was no change of characters. Team Natsu are quite funny and supportive as usual. Juvi, Gajeel and Levy have also no changes at all, just like the old Fairy Tail. Still I love that.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
I did enjoy every moment of this movie... and am sure fans who read the manga  will really enjoy watching it as it contains some there and there spoilers from the manga.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
Overall it is one of the best movies that I had watched. I expected nothing less from Hiro Sensei, as he is one of the best storytellers I had read from. I really love Fairy Tail and it is my favorite movie ever, but still am sure anime fans who are no that close to Fairy Tail will even like it.<br />
<br />
Thank you!!!!!!!!<br />
I hope it can be helpful.<br />

    It is my first review I hope and you like it<br />
I will first say that I will review it from 2 points of view the objective and subjective I will start with the objective:<br />
objectively the movie is mediocre and seen many worse yes. First I liked the beginning to see natsu falling and then they will explain how I got there although in my opinion they did it very badly then 20 or 30 minutes of pure fanservice that I do not complain I love it in fairy tail fanservice but 80% dislike them later They show us gajeel levy and juvia who are going

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411690">
        on a mission and I was happy after months of finishing fairy tail that in the movie my fav characters came out I was excited but it was very poorly managed: first they don&#039;t say what the mission is about, just suddenly They arrive at the kingdom then we do not see what they do whenever they appeared they said 2 words and they cut them like that the whole movie when they start fighting out of nowhere juvia appears going where gray so out of nowhere they do not explain what their mission was that they did in the kingdom also apart from juvia levy gajeel they did nothing at the time of fighting only 2 blows and voila. the 2nd part of the movie when it is discovered that the king was sonya I was surprised it was a good plot twist and it was managed very well the animation was very good the epic fights in general mediocre but pulling good<br />
<br />
now the subjective:<br />
Subjectively speaking, I loved it, the animation was great, good soundtrack, Gajeel and Levy appeared, who are my favorites, that always adds points, the great fanservice, I loved seeing Lucy and Erza, the fights as always, very good when Natsu becomes half dragon, it was EPIC !! I literally shouted when it happened and when the dragon said you are the one who will destroy all E.N.D and he responds with the beautiful nakamapower and in the end that hug between lucy and natsu is the best of the movie a hug is always appreciated between them<br />
and the end with acnology and the past of what happened to sonya I liked it I feel that it fit perfectly with the plot of fairy tail and the dragons<br />
in general as the fan N1 of fairy tail I loved it<br />
9/10

    Short Review - Spoiler Free<br />
<br />
Overall this was a pretty decent movie. Certainly much better than the last Fairy Tail movie. Animation was fantastic, better than the actual series. The story itself was all right and would&#039;ve been better if there was more time to work with. The fights and the story itself felt pretty rushed. There was too much in too little of amount of time. A concern I have as well is the amount of sexual fanservice in this movie. It takes away from it and has too much focus. I&#039;m shocked to see that &quot;ecchi&quot; is not a genre for this movie.<br />
<br />
Overall I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284398">
        gave it an 8/10, but I think roughly a 7.5 is a bit more accurate. The average rating for this movie is a pretty good and true. Which is a bit surprising since Fairy Tail gets more hate than it deserves.

    Hiro Mashima promised us a surprise, and boy did he give us a surprise. Your surprise at my score given that I am a fairy tail fan is only half the surprise you&#039;ll get when watching the actual movie. It is unimaginably terrible. (how did it get over 7 is beyond me, tbh I actually had this listed as a 5 on my list)<br />
<br />
So lets just go over the good bits, the sound was good, but that is to be expected from a fairy tail title, unfortunately you shouldn&#039;t expect too much from the new stuff and the old tracks that make fairy tail fairy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263863">
        tail are few and far between. (8)<br />
<br />
As for the art, I&#039;m not too sure whether its just me or if the arts actually taken one step forward and three steps back. It doesn&#039;t exactly feel as good as the 2014 series but still holds its own when put up against other anime. (7)<br />
<br />
The characters are a huge part in fairy tail, and unfortunately the way the movie was written and what have you just weren&#039;t put to use correctly and to be honest felt quite shallow, just like this review (6)<br />
<br />
The story, boy oh boy the story, my question is what story? This whole plot revolves around what Joker did to his colleagues in the first 5 minutes of the Batman movie. Not many other twist and turns really. Some people would argue that there are surprises towards the end of the movie, but rather than surprises it feels more like throwing random facts at you as quickly as they could in the last 15 minutes of the movie. (2)<br />
<br />
All in all, not a movie to watch unless it plays an important part in the coming season (oh yes I need to mention here that there is a time skip involved so some of you might be able to better understand it after the new season starts). (4)

    IF YOU ONLY WATCH THE ANIME AND DO NOT READ THE MANGA, THEN STAY WAY! THERE ARE A LOT OF SPOILERS THAT ARE NOT ADDRESSED IN THE ANIME YET! <br />
<br />
Now that&#039;s out of the way. After 2 years or so without any proper Fairy Tail animation release the fans finally get what they want... an mediocre anime movie that oddly fits the canon, but somehow still it&#039;s in it&#039;s own little world.  Unless you really want to just see some of what Fairy Tail usually offers after 2 years of withdraw then I would stay away from this movie. <br />
<br />
The story is the same

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255474">
        cookie cutter style of anime movie when you want to stay away from canon as much as possible. The gang (Natsu, Lucy, Happy, Gray, Erza, ect.) take a mission from the Fiore kingdom to travel to a small island nation of Stella so you don&#039;t have to worry about running into it in the grand story besides a light mention. A bunch of baddies that are pretty forgettable appear, take all powerful artifact that oddly been missing thought the series, and then regret their mistake afterwards because it&#039;s power can not be controlled. <br />
<br />
Pretty simple and straight forward. I think there was only one thing that &quot;surprised&quot; me, but honestly wasn&#039;t a huge deal. A double edge sword of the movie is that it goes straight into the conflict of the movie than instead of dancing around it. We don&#039;t get much info about what is going on though and what is happening. One moment the gang is in a field being transported somewhere and the next they are back in the base of the enemy in the next scene.<br />
<br />
The art is good when the fight scenes are light and really have that A-1 Pictures look when having the character express their feelings or simple movements. Kind of the only reason I like the sound is because I missed that Fairy Tail theme and the general music direction that the series as, but it doesn&#039;t challenge itself or try anything different. <br />
<br />
The characters don&#039;t change much or grow, which honestly isn&#039;t a bad thing. Natsu is still hot-headed, Happy gets himself in crazy and funny situations, Lucy is the damsel in distress at times, and every one still as their same interactions with each other that makes them like able. It&#039;s the movie characters that I grew bored of and just forgot about. And sure, let&#039;s have all of them show off their ultimate abilities so we can remember how bad ass they are for a minute or 2. <br />
<br />
Overall, the movie made me laugh when it wanted to and watching some of my favorite characters come back in animation made me smile. But that&#039;s about it. I was getting bored a little more than halfway of the film and was zoning out. Events happen with out explanation, the fights are ok at best, the characters are enjoyable to see, music and sound effects are what you expect from the anime along with updated look. If you want to get your Fairy Tail fix and can&#039;t wait until 2018 when the anime series comes out then watch this, but you are only getting a short high from a massive hangover that is story and overall elements of a movie.     <br />

    So I actually really enjoy Fairy Tail and have both read the manga and watched the anime. But this movie was just horrible. I mean how was this even able to get made, the movie is just a glorified tit fest/fan service trash. Fairy Tail has always been more on the fan service side but this was way beyond that. <br />
The movie also gives new meaning to plot holes, I mean how can you have a movie that are just individual scenes cut together without any kind of bridge to connect them. They do not explain anything that happens in the movie. Like did Sonya

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264604">
        travel to the future or has she just lived for more than 400 years, will she die now that the dragon has left her, then why was she still alive when the movie ended. Or how did Natsu change into that new form and how did he survive being stabbed. The only thing that the movie set up decently was Happy is afraid of dogs and so when he faces the red dog he has to overcome his fears. When the only character development in your movie is with the cat sidekick and not any of the main hero you may have a problem. <br />
They start of decent with Natsu being trapped and going back in time to show us how, setting up the plot about Dragon Cry, showing us the main villains but then it just goes downhill from there. <br />
It&#039;s like that was the only part they had written while working on the movie<br />
All we know about our hero we can just forget that, they are now way weaker then we know them to be. Especially Ezra, she is supposed to be a strong warrior but in this movie her strength is nowhere to be found. She has always been there to show us what real strength is but now she and Lucy are just there to show us their big boobs and their panties. I just hope that they will not do this to the anime or manga otherwise this series is finished.

    I&#039;m surprised that this shit sells so much, this movie used the cake formula that is used throughout fairy tail.<br />
<br />
° The famous strategy puts your half-naked characters tossing their breasts.<br />
<br />
°Making appear strong enemies that give a beating in the protagonists, soon after the defeat they fight again and of course that our heroes win (kkk).<br />
<br />
°Then appear an even stronger enemy and use the wonders of the power of friendship and protagonism to defeat him.<br />
<br />
About the characters I can say the design was very good the used trait left the characters more beautiful than in the anime, as always the design of the female characters totally

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284626">
        unnecessary showing up some differences in the measurements shown in the anime (Wtf !!! that sena of Erza in the bar what the hell those breasts were).<br />
<br />
I think it is not necessary to comment much more about how deplorable and uncreative is the story of fairy tail<br />

    Ok first of all, all of the enemies were weak, natsu, gray, erza and wendy could&#039;ve easily beaten them all solo! also DEMON SLAYER MAGIC IS SUPPOSE TI BE OP! WHEN GREY&#039;S DAD USED IT, NATSU COULDNT EVEN MELT IT!!!<br />
ALSO ERZA COULDVE DESTROYED ALL OF THEM WITH HER PHYSICAL ABILITIES WITHOUT USING MAGIC. IT GETS ME SO FRUSTRATED WHEN ALL THE FAIRY TAIL MEMBERS GET BEAT UP EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE AGAINST THE WEAKEST OPPONENTS!!! ARGHH IM DONE<br />
<br />
second is that natsu couldnt even break a steel chain. just because he was out of power... HOW PATHETIC! why is everyone weak again seriously. in the magic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265071">
        games when natsu comes back to lucy, he melts everything around the arena. I understand lucy is weak but HOW CAN THE ENEMY BE SO STRONG I MEAN, THEY ARE AS STRONG AS DRAGON SLAYERS AND DEMON SLAYERS!<br />
<br />
THIRD, where is laxus&#039; group? BRING ME EVERGREEN!!! JUST OPEN UR EYES AND TURN THEM INTO STONE ALREADY ARGHHHH IM SO DONE WITH THIS ANIME! I HAD REALLY HIGH HOPES THAT NATSU WAS ALREADY THE 3rd STRONGEST besides from acknologia and zeref<br />
I EVEN THOUGHT HE WOULD ONE SHOT EVERYONE! EVEN GREY BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. im legit done. anyways here is a quote that i saw (not in the movie) DONT EXPECT ANYTHING FROM ANYONE

    So this is my first review... I might mess up but screw it  I&#039;m gonna give it a try.<br />
<br />
Fairy tail movie 2: Dragon cry.... This movie is mediocre at best. I seen worse movies than this but this is probably the worse anime movie I seen awhile.<br />
<br />
Let me say this: I&#039;m not fully caught up with Fairy tail. I haven&#039;t reached the time skip yet so I&#039;m still far behind but... I know enough fairy tail to have an idea about the characters and lore. This movie did nothing to impress me or surprise me. Let me break down why I didnt like this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279872">
        movie.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. STORY<br />
The story is basically a retrieval mission gone wrong. Nothing more than that. It has no real build up and a laughable climax. The end of the story will leave with more questions than answers. No tension, no good drama... I&#039;m seriously trying to find one good thing about this story but I cant find it.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. ACTION <br />
The action is passable at best but I expected more from a movie. Everyone in the guild had their 5 seconds of getting some hits in but of course natsu gets the bulk of the action. One fight in particular I&#039;m highly disappointed with the one with Erza and wizard who does the kicks (I forgot her name and it dosen&#039;t really matter lol). They focused too much on Erza&#039;s boobs than the fight itself. Now I&#039;m a man who doesn&#039;t mind fan service sometimes but Erza is serious character and to make light of her struggle with the camera on her boobs the majority of the fight is disrespectful. Besides that, the other fights were ok at best. Nothing special.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. ANIMATION <br />
The animation is probably the best thing about this movie but that&#039;s not saying much. The scenery, bright colors and how everyone look in this movie was good. Some facial expressions were kinda cheap looking but other than that, props to the people in charge of the animation team. If you like the animation in the anime, you will love it here.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. VILLIAN <br />
Here is where the confusion comes into play. Throughout the movie, theres two villains in the movie and it makes you wonder which one is gonna be main one. It was like the movie didnt know which guy (or dragon) wanted to be the main villian. When you get to the climax, you finally see who the real villain is but what happened to the other guy.... nobody knows and the movie didnt either as you can see when you get to the end. So since Animus is the main villian, let&#039;s just focus on him. He&#039;s not the worst villain I seen but he&#039;s boring. Anger and revenge is his play in a nutshell and after he found out Natsu is a dragon slayer, he wanted to kill him and the rest of his kind for what they did in the past. He had a moment of glory but plot armor Natsu got a boost and Animus was looked at the end. Even with all Dragon cry staff...he wasnt strong enough which is ok because that&#039;s how all anime movies end if not most... it&#039;s just a painfully mediocre villian and his death was laughable bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
FINAL THOUGHTS:<br />
<br />
You are not messing a thing if you skip this movie. Nothing special. Barely entertaining. Just stick to the anime or manga. Use your time wisely. Thanks for reading guys.<br />
<br />
PS: Why are Erza and Lucy&#039;s boobs so unusually big? It&#039;s a turn off for me honestly. I dont like how the fanservice is done in this movie.<br />
<br />

    After waiting 2 years for this film I&#039;m glad to say that this was worth my time and dedication since this was the anime to get me back into anime from the age of 11. I loved how they still are committed to save each other and be there in their darkest times as well. In the film we see Natsu unveil his magic to a higher extend and seeing everyone else fighting like the good ol&#039; days. Also some spoilers ahead I loved how Natsu transformed half of his body like a dragon when fighting one in front of him. Even going as far

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264015">
        as to hurt himself to restore Dragon Cry only to be destroyed by Sonya close to the end of the film. Overall I give this film an 8 since there could be some spots to improve on and maybe put in, it was definitely worth my time to watch it.

    Before I start I just wanna say, for the sake of argument, is that at most I&#039;ll be comparing it to what we know of the fairy tail anime.  <br />
<br />
Personally this movie came as a massive underwhelming addition to the fairy tail franchise , ascalthough it remained it&#039;s comedic properties, the story became more and more distorted...but introduced new moves of which we have no knowledge about, adding to that (after understanding the time restraints) the character build up was slightly poorer in contrast to movie 1; the phoenix priestess.<br />
<br />
At first, going in, I immediately assumed that it is set after season 2 and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263649">
        before season 3; however, for now it should be assumed as canon because I have a feeling that the moves that  saw will be explored in the third season. <br />
<br />
Other than that, aspects of it did keep me surprised...<br />
________________<br />
SPOILER_ALERT<br />
________________<br />
E.g. Natsu&#039;s true form... For me it felt as a bit of a &#039;tell tail&#039; (tell tale, a pun?..) because it didn&#039;t seem as though Lucy had seen Natsu&#039;s e.n.d form (I think, i just watch the anime😅), moreover when he did change, the image was something that kept flickering between his normal self and that form... Which is also suggestive of hallucinations on his enemy&#039;s part as they may be aware of something similar (still up for debate in my opinion. But hey, we&#039;ll truly learn it&#039;s meaning in the 3 season.<br />
<br />
What I can safely say is, that with the knowledge of the movie by information in the third season, it will begin to fit in a lot more and rate higher as well.<br />
<br />
The biggest bummer for me was the idea of not screaming out the moves before you do the move, and they explicitly teased this area of the anime by Gray shouting &#039;ice make..&#039; but finishing with &#039;wagon wheel&#039; in a monotonous voice (&#039;cause he was trying to fix a wagon wheel 😂😅😅)<br />
<br />
Apart from that, there was some great fan service of Lucy dancing but poor progress was made in terms of relationships (I shouldn&#039;t have expected too much anyway)<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous:<br />
-the animation for the movies were the same as it&#039;s anime counterpart<br />
<br />
So lastly, if you&#039;re not a diehard Ft fan, I&#039;d say watch this movie after some episodes of season 3 so you&#039;re no questioning as much, but it&#039;s your opinion entirely....<br />
Anyways, do let me know what you think<br />

    Where should I start to review this mess of a movie , I rarely get this disappointed in sth since I carefully choose what I should watch. Let&#039;s just say that the Fairytail as we knew it seems to be dying. The worst part of the movie is the storytelling. First it throws you in while you have no idea what has happened in between of the movie and 2014 anime then it throws a creepy crappy story at you without any kind of logic in it , no development no real fight scenes absolutely nothing. It ONLY has the Fairytail name anything else is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264227">
        dead . When i first watched Fairytail I hadn&#039;t seen One Piece so this is the first Fairytail that I watch after seeing One Piece and oh boy was I disappointed in Fairytail. It doesn&#039;t even feel like a good copy of One Piece.<br />
Even if you compare the movies OP movies are on a completely different level. The only things decent in the dragon cry were the animation and overall sounding of it and tbh they weren&#039;t anything special if you consider it as a 2017 movie. You will probably watch this if you&#039;re a diehard fan of the series but it really is not worth the time you spend watching it.<br />

    ::Spoilers::<br />
<br />
The plot really doesn&#039;t make much sense at all and it&#039;s way too fast-paced. The movie actually has a lot of interesting ideas, but it fails to actually do anything with them.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s honestly a bummer, the movie has a lot of good scenes and it&#039;s overall just really enjoyable to watch; however, the good scenes don&#039;t get enough time to really shine. For example, there&#039;s a scene where Lucy is kidnapped by the main villain and is about to be tortured for his magic before being immediately saved by Natsu, who rushed over as fast as he possibly could because he blames himself for her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review381434">
        capture. On paper, this actually sounds really interesting. Natsu was forced to hurt one of his closest friends due to mind control magic via the villain and it&#039;s because of this that she was captured. However, it fails to actually start or go anywhere. Lucy is saved within minutes of waking up in the dungeon and we get less than a minute total of Natsu looking for her and being upset with himself for the situation. <br />
<br />
This could have been a really interesting character study on Natsu. He&#039;s someone who values his loved ones more than anything, and that is shown multiple times within the movie itself even before this scene. Just take a moment to imagine the pain Natsu must have felt. Even though he knew he was being mind-controlled, he&#039;s still the type of character that would beat himself up over not being strong enough to fight back against it. No matter how illogical it may be to think he could stand against the mind-control, he&#039;s still the type of character to think he could or should have. <br />
<br />
And yet, this is never explored. We have maybe 2 scenes that are seconds long each showing Natsu being mad at himself, but they don&#039;t even last long enough to be anything noteworthy besides a &quot;what could have been&quot;. We don&#039;t even get a touching moment after Lucy is saved where this is discussed, the most we get is Natsu wanting to fight and Lucy stopping him by saying they need to understand his magic before they can stand against him. Again, this could have led to something, anything. But it falls flat immediately. This is the last time the situation is mentioned. I will say that I haven&#039;t finished the movie yet, I still have 20 minutes to go. But a big character moment like this doesn&#039;t work if it&#039;s completely ignored and then gets suddenly brought up during the last 5 minutes. It needs proper set and build up.<br />
<br />
The almost torture scene also never goes anywhere. Lucy was mind-controlled into being obedient to the villain, allowing him to tie her up, then standing still while he was about to do whatever he would have done, which was implied to be assault amongst the torture. The villain explains that he has these girls in the basement to cut up in order to harvest their blood for his dark magic, as it apparently needs a lot of blood despite us never being shown him needing blood or how that would work. He just goes straight to wanting to cut Lucy before Natsu storms in.<br />
<br />
Now, call me a sadist all you want, but I wish Lucy had been captured longer. I don&#039;t think it would have taken away from the movie at all if we&#039;d had a longer sequence showing Natsu searching for Lucy with the others, and finally finding her only after she&#039;s had some of her blood already harvested. I really think this would have been a good character moment for Natsu.<br />
<br />
Honestly, one of my favorite scenes in the movie was soon after this. Lucy is on watch for the night and is staring at the small view of the sky she can see through the forest canopy. Natsu suddenly comes down from the canopy, sees her upset, and convinces her to climb up the tree to show her the starry sky, something she previously mentioned really wanting to see. It was a sweet moment between them and shows how observant and caring Natsu really is. I think it would have been great for Natsu and Lucy to have a talk about him attacking her and her capture here; however, it&#039;s just shown that Natsu spent the whole time... training? If you can call it that? To be able to destroy a material on the island stronger than diamond. Although I don&#039;t think this is a bad scene by any means, it really goes along with the previously mentioned to showcase just how much wasted potential was in this film. I understand that not every film can be a 3-hour Avengers movie, but that doesn&#039;t mean it can&#039;t still be good.<br />
<br />
Overall, it is an enjoyable watch and I do recommend it to any Fairy Tail fans out there. It has fun scenes, funny moments, and a great soundtrack. I like a lot of the character interactions between the main cast, especially during the heist. But it just wasn&#039;t enjoyable enough to save it from constant wasted potential and a story that doesn&#039;t make any sense past the heist.<br />
<br />
EDIT: just finished the last 20 minutes and wow it just got worse the longer it went. The best part of the end was Natsu asking &quot;What do I look like&quot; and Lucy replying &quot;like you&quot;. Nice call back to the beginning and I like the implication of Natsu being scared of what he is. I didn&#039;t think he found out that he&#039;s E.N.D until the fight with Zeref, but maybe I&#039;m remembering wrong or Natsu doesn&#039;t actually know entirely that he&#039;s E.N.D yet.

    I&#039;d like to start by mentioning how I&#039;ve grown to be bored with Fairy Tail. I feel like the stories haven&#039;t been as good since its original season. I was reluctant at first but then I eventually succumbed to the &#039;What if its good&#039; temptation, and it turned out it was. <br />

Like I stated earlier after the first season of fairy tail, I&#039;ve felt the stories weren&#039;t as good and the same applies here. Their were several plot holes in the story that were not explained or did not make sense. I won&#039;t mention them but be aware of blatant

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264119">
        ignorance to any timeline before the film.<br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
I won&#039;t get much into it but it was good. Since this is a movie it got a higher budget so you can expect slightly better animation and quality. Also it seems as if the boobs for Lucy, Juvia and Erza got bigger ( or maybe thats just me) lol.<br />
<br />
Character 6/10<br />
One of my big problems with fairy tail is the antagonists. I believe any show is only as good as the antagonists, sometimes we develop a love hate relationship with them or we blatantly wish their death, which is good because they draw out our emotions and get us more involved. None of that is delivered with the main antagonists here . <br />
The main casts are their usual self, nothing particularly special happens. I would have hoped their would be some character developments or hopefully a further development of romantic relationships established. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7/10<br />
This is what is more important for me at the end of any media. How much I enjoyed it, I could even forget all sorts of horrible mistakes if the level of enjoyment was great. <br />
It did not disappoint, the action was great I liked how it felt more real than it usually did in fairy tail. I read the fairy tail manga and I hated how blood was edited out in the anime, it took away a sense of realism and danger. The power ups were great too. The friendship between the group was and  will always be refreshing. <br />
<br />
Overall it was a decent movie and a great time. <br />

    I am admittedly a huge fan of the Fairy Tail anime. Since the last anime run had concluded I have had serious Fairy Tail withdrawal. Imagine my excitement when my girlfriend and I received a notification from Funimation that Fairy Tail: Dragon Cry was playing in select theaters; and after looking up screen times, we were fortunate to have it showing at our local theater. Without hesitation, we purchased tickets and saw the film last night. Who could complain about more Fairy Tail content? It turns out that you can.<br />
<br />
Story (4) - As a movie, you go into it with the understanding that this is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255500">
        a standalone story and really does not fit in canon-wise with the overall timeline of the series. That said, the story was by far the weakest facet of this movie. In short, the central plot revolves around an ultra-powerful magic item that has been stolen and it is up to Fairy Tail to retrieve it or else the entire world is in jeopardy. The film opens up with a rather muddled time-skip sequence that seems rather unnecessary considering the short amount of time needed to resolve said time-skip. They could have played it straight and made more sense. Conversely, within this time-skip sequence is a rather brutal scene that sets a tone for how serious the matter is, as well as how ruthless the antagonists can and should be. It begins with a dark theme. From there, it fails to sustain that feeling and the ruthlessness takes a huge dive. The climax and resolution of the story ultimately feel very compact and rushed. I think ultimately I was disappointed with the execution of the story and also feel with a longer run-time they could have probably presented it better. The biggest let-down was how generic the story played out. It all felt like I&#039;ve seen it before. On the flip-side, where the story actually excels is in three notable areas: a rather nifty clandestine team operation by the guild that felt fresh and different, an unexpected plot-twist that felt out of nowhere, and an extra scene that sets the table for the next anime run.<br />
<br />
Art (7) - I enjoyed the art quite a bit all things considered. New areas looked visually pleasing but right at home in the Fairy Tail universe. New characters had that classic Fairy Tail feel to them. There were even some new looks for our familiar friends -- including a side-ponytail design for Wendy that was so adorable. The movie was not without it&#039;s &quot;quality&quot; issues that you see in week to week programming, but was more noticeable given this was a movie production. The film was also pretty stocked with CGI scenes. I am personally indifferent to the use of CGI in anime so long as it blends with the rest of the art. I thought it did ok in that regard -- not great. Another area where this film suffered, and it is unfortunate, is the battle scenes. For a show with magic battles as a foundation, the battles were very boring. Multiple battles go on at once and the focus is essentially a short struggle followed by the heroes pulling out their trump cards. Battles were over before they ever really began. OK PERSONAL GRIPE TIME: can we please leave Lucy&#039;s boobs alone? I get it, they are large, but throughout the movie it felt as thought they kept getting bigger and bigger scene to scene. It is absolutely comical and you can&#039;t help but laugh at how awful the artists treat her sometimes. She&#039;s actually an awesome character that just seems burdened by these balloon tits and it is sometimes really hard to take her seriously.<br />
<br />
Sound (10) - Fairy Tail has had some of the best, if not the best, soundtracks. Whether it is in insert music, openings, or endings; the music is always fantastic. This feature film is no exception. The regular cast returns reprising their roles which is already solid. New characters&#039; voices were also well cast. Sound is not an issue in this film in the least.<br />
<br />
Character (6) - There&#039;s the classic adage in regards to standalone anime films that movie villains will never be seen nor heard from again, but for the next hour and a half they are the most important and dangerous enemy there is. That statement aptly applies to this film. New characters are presented but feel rather hollow. They have no substance, or are rendered moot. You have your main villain and cliche henchmen 1 through 3. Trying my best to avoid spoilers, the supposed antagonist of this movie is present in the brutal scene I reference in the &quot;Story&quot; section; but does not maintain that ruthlessness throughout. He is presented as this powerful badass, only to be neutered by comic relief. It is rather disappointing considering how they present him from the beginning of the film. By the end of the film he feels like a cowardly heel and had zero credibility. The henchmen are forgettable and are there merely to give the supporting cast something to do. On the contrary, one character is given tremendous development and actually can be linked to the main storyline of the series in some way. She comes off as feeling important and not just a milquetoast movie character. That said, a large chunk of this film&#039;s characters are the main cast where we already know them from watching weekly. I believe this film suffers from over-saturation of main cast because for the most part they stood around doing nothing while the story was being resolved. While you can say it was nice to see them, they were there merely for token screen-time and offer nothing to the story.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8) - Despite my harsh criticisms, I found the film enjoyable. It was more Fairy Tail content! I can&#039;t be mad with that. It&#039;s a lot more enjoyable when you watch it knowing it isn&#039;t directly tied to the story and can take it for what it is. Not once did I feel like I was wasting my time watching it and it was honestly a lot of fun. I did leave the theater thinking the film was rather rushed and probably suffered a lot from that. Had they had two hours as opposed to the hour and twenty five minutes it had, they probably could have executed the story better or presented the characters more favorably. The part that was perhaps &quot;too much&quot; was the over-abundance of fanservice. Fairy Tail has always had its &quot;puff puff&quot; moments, but personal gripe regarding Lucy&#039;s bust aside, the fanservice was rather extensive. Also, as someone who is not up to date on the manga, there were some parts that were spoilers for the main story. However, that is my fault for not reading the manga. The material is out there to familiarize yourself with beforehand.<br />
<br />
Overall (7) - Fairy Tail: Dragon Cry was a perfectly fine way to spend a Monday night. It is by no means a masterpiece, but is perfectly acceptable. The first film was much better by and large. Really what this film does is give you some animated Fairy Tail content to hold you over until the final weekly run airs and does that well. What it accomplished for me personally was to get me excited for the final run and conclusion of the series, no matter how sad that really makes me.
