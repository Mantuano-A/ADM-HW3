009-1 is yet another statistic of this occurrence, being passed up for the far more popular Death Note, Code Geass, Welcome to the NHK, Higurashi, Black Lagoon, Gintama, Ouran High School Host Club and much more that aired that same year. A huge contributing factor as to why this might have happened, outside of the popularity of the previously mentioned works, could be the appeal that 009-1 was going for. An appeal, that, at the time, wasn&#039;t something the anime market was yearning for. But perhaps this is the right time for it to make a resurgence in the public consciousness, as this very appeal has recently gotten in the forefront of what&#039;s dominating the conversation in the community.   <br />
 <br />
As of late, there&#039;s been a growing trend in adapting older anime/manga titles or adhering to the aesthetic qualities of them to either retrofit it to a newer audience or to service the older fans of the medium. With entries like Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure, Hunter X Hunter, Sailor Moon Crystal, Parasyte and Kill la Kill, to just name a few, 009-1 is more or less an earlier case of this. But where something like Kill la Kill and Parasyte is trying to use that appeal, while also adhering to modern day sensibilities, for 009-1, I think it&#039;s safe to say that it&#039;s targeted to a different crowd altogether. It&#039;s a show made for those anime fans that have been around long enough before programming was merely a click away, and the idea of simulcasting was still just a wet dream. It&#039;s targeted towards the people that have lived through the days where sheepishly purchasing a VHS copy of animated ultra-violence from the video store was the norm and would often leave a hole in your wallet. A time when curious kids, their older cousins, and best friends, would secretly gather to watch Ninja Scroll, MD Geist, Tekkaman Blade or what have you, and knew that this was something different. They knew that this wasn&#039;t your ordinary cartoons on TV, this was violent, this was &quot;adult,&quot; this was awesome!<br />
<br />
While presented with a little more class than your macho men solving issues with their fists, 009-1 still contains that old school aesthetic with its art style and story structure, borrowing heavily from the early Tatsunoko Production era of animated works. What makes it different, however, is the kind of content it chooses to cover. Following the narrative of a Hollywood spy flick, 009-1 not only takes a page from retro animes&#039; book in how it looks but also the spy thrillers from that era of film as well. <br />
<br />
This is immediately made apparent from the setting and subject matter it chooses to inhabit.<br />
<br />
The story takes place in an alternate timeline where the Cold War never ended, as the world is split into two factions, the East and West block. While presenting peace and negotiation to the public, behind the scenes, these two governing bodies of each wing are waging war against each other, in an endless pursuit to proclaim dominion over the opposing side. One of the primary methods they often utilized were the use of secret intelligence operatives, or spies if you prefer, to either implant counterintelligence information or to gather intel on the enemy. The anime revolves around the escapades of one of these spies, Mylene Hoffman, or better known by her codename, 009-1. <br />
<br />
Presented in a semi-episodic structure, a majority of the series follow the stand-alone missions of 009-1. With the help of cybernetics and acquired skills as a secret agent, we watch her take on these missions either by herself or with the assistance of other members. With buildups that led into frenetic spurts of action in every episode, the anime made sure that the narrative was never dragging on its heels. Now, where the movie buffs would be pleased is the way each episode plays out. The show is like a hybrid of the James Bond, Charlie&#039;s Angels, The Bionic Woman and several other titles that fall within the secret agent sub-genre. These missions can range from espionage to your classic assassination showdowns. The only downside is that it never breaks the mold of this formulaic construct associated with your garden variety spy/thriller stories. If you expect something beyond the usual offerings, you&#039;ll probably be let down, however, if secret agent antics is all that you came for, 009-1 will certainly deliver. <br />
<br />
The show also tries to be more adult orientated by not shying away from sex and violence, but due to the character designs (which we&#039;ll discuss later) and the show&#039;s &quot;to-the-letter&quot; writing, it was a hit or miss at times. Credit is given for it not shying away from the use of sex appeal and violence, despite the slightly juvenile attempt on the matter. It&#039;s these elements that are integral to the spy genre and would have felt baseless without it. <br />
<br />
Now the biggest downside to this episodic structure is that there&#039;s never a real sense of finality when everything is said and done. It still had its appeal and entertainment value, but with no direction or end goal set in place, there was nothing to take away from it. It served no actual purpose beyond retro flavoring and paying homage to spy flicks. Not that I wanted it to do anything more, in the first place, but it&#039;s still something that needs to be addressed. <br />
<br />
The only continuity that the show had come around the latter half where a plot-line involving mutants took place. But like most of the show, it ultimately led nowhere in the end and was more of the same storylines presented before but with the added benefit of being more extensively explored. So if you adjust your expectations accordingly, 009-1 could be an entertaining romp. It&#039;s the moment you start demanding more than it begins to fall apart.  <br />
<br />
The 1st thing that&#039;ll jump out at you is undoubtedly the art-style. It brings together an old-school aesthetic with a modern day presentation, which understandably means that intended audience might be more geared towards young adults and older. Given that it&#039;s an adaptation of a manga that was published during 1967-74, this depiction was intentional. It&#039;s packaged with retro fans in mind, but that doesn&#039;t mean that younger anime viewers wouldn&#039;t find it serviceable as well. It&#039;s just that those keen to the older art-style methods would find it more appealing than those unfamiliar or use to contemporary art-style standards. It&#039;s as if the show had captured a cryogenically frozen state in anime&#039;s metamorphosis and decided to wait until the 2000s to thaw it out.<br />
<br />
The characters were literally drawn to their archetype, with exaggerated body features often being used to emphasize what kind of personality trait they would portray. Maniacal villains looked maniacal; rotten old hags looked rotten; bodacious super spies looked bodacious, and so on. It helped to make them easily distinguishable, if only at the cost of not always looking appealing. While the artistic initiative can be respected, it did run of risk of some of the characters coming across as caricatures than actual people. They can range from simplistic to body models ripped right out of the pages of a classic Disney film. Despite some of the outlandish character designs (even for retro standards), the animation is quite fluid. The character movements had a sense of elasticity to them, making actions scenes easy to comprehend and engaging to follow. It wasn&#039;t overly extravagant but the effort placed in was quite apparent, and when compared to titles made around the same time, it was a cut above the rest.<br />
<br />
Stark shading and limited color choices were used to make the environments and set pieces morbid and dreary, which lends itself well to the kind of mystique commonly associated with spies. This minimalistic color choice was also sometimes used to emphasize scenes or things of interest within keyframes further. It was a pleasant touch of visual storytelling that wasn&#039;t exceptional but certainly appreciated. The tone often changed in accordance with the mission being carried out, but for the most part, it had a particular melancholic mood throughout. It felt cold and desolate, often reflecting the mentality of the adult cast the show is primarily consisted of.<br />
The unique art style coupled with the dark tone made it stand out from what&#039;s commonly being produced today. For retro fans, it&#039;s visual eye-candy, and for modern ones, it&#039;ll be an uncommon (but hopefully enjoyable) experience. <br />
<br />
Voice acting ranged from good to overly schmaltzy. From the silly mimicking of a British accent to a cartoonish Russian rendition, you could tell that the voice actors and actresses were all having fun with the roles. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to fool someone into thinking he was born and raised in the USA, needless to say, no one is taking it too seriously. Despite this, I highly suggest watching it dubbed, as it adds to the throwback feeling the show exudes. It hammy and overdone at times but to its benefit given the caricature designs.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is reminiscent of that of many secret agent flicks, with booming brass sections, heavy percussion thumping, violin instrumentals interspersed and sultry musical undertone. Like entering the smoky room of an unground jazz pub. It&#039;s smooth, it&#039;s stylish, and fits the show like a glove. While nothing I recommend listening to by itself, it does its job well. <br />
<br />
Like their designs, the characters were also simplistic. This didn&#039;t hurt the show, however, as it never required in-depth personalities to carry the content. Our protagonist, 009-1, is a blonde bombshell with a level-headed attitude. While she let her emotions often get the best of her, she still manages to carry out her assignments without her feelings hindering her. She&#039;s a field agent that&#039;s partially cynical due to her line of work but still cares enough that you know her actions are mostly done out of a sense of duty. Equipped with cybernetics and built-in weaponry, she&#039;s pretty much a walking Swiss-army-knife. Her arsenal, as well as the other cyber women regularly introduced, vary from person to person.<br />
<br />
As the story further plays out, we&#039;re eventually given a backstory to pin her with, making her slightly more human as a result. Outside of our main character, every other side character is treated as just that; side characters. None ever takes center-stage and are often there to merely round out the experience. Despite that, a few of the one-off characters were adequately characterized before the 20-minute time span was up. They were given a motive, a personality, and to some degree, an understandable reason for being. Since the story format limits most of these characters from being reoccurring ones, it was hard to grow to attached to any of them, they were fleshed out enough to be passable but didn&#039;t have enough screen presence to make a lasting impression. Other reoccurring characters also included a few other cybernetic female agents that would often work alongside 009-1 and others that became more relevant towards the show&#039;s final act. While as individuals the characters didn&#039;t amount to much, their dialogue and interaction among each other slightly made up for it. There was always this sharp wit and banter to the conversations they all shared with each other, especially when our protagonist was at the receiving end of said dialogue. <br />
<br />
009-1 offers enough to work, but nothing beyond that, and that&#039;s fine. It&#039;s a show with a specific intent that never veers off course to grab at things it&#039;s not capable pulling off. This commitment may have kept others from recommending it, given the very limited space of appeal it&#039;s going for, but it certainly worked in its favor when that&#039;s all you really want out of it.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t anticipate liking this as much as I did, but because of the brisk pacing, art direction, and sense of energy, I wasn&#039;t ever bored. It&#039;s a show that worked from moment-to-moment. I might not take away much from the experience, but I didn&#039;t feel like I wasted my time either. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a fan of the spy genre or just love that 60-70s aesthetic, then I highly suggest checking this one out. It had style and knew its target audience, which is saying a lot when compared to shows that desperately cling to broad appeal and miss everyone all at once. While a little rough around the edges, 009-1 carried itself with a type of swagger and confidence that was undeniable. And if only for that alone, I believe it&#039;s a title worth checking out.

    Lion tamers, Lion tamers; come one, come all!<br />
<br />
We try to make sense of something that is all too rare. A anime with some true meaning.<br />
<br />
I speak of course, of &quot;009-1&quot;<br />
<br />
This anime is a product of 2006, and as such; creates very little that people under the age of 20 will actually &#039;get&#039;. In other words, there will be complaints that the artwork is sub-par, or the soundtrack is a little simple. In other words, production values are not good enough to suit them.<br />
<br />
If everyone who ever said that, tried to do an anime before modern production software was available, then they&#039;d have more appreciation for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review183303">
        the art and science of making anime. After all, Japanese anime began in the 1910&#039;s, and did not become &#039;mainstream&#039; until the 1980&#039;s (check out the very good article on the &#039;history of anime&#039;, in Wikipedia).<br />
<br />
That being said, most of us, over the age of 30, can appreciate even lousy production values; as long as the story holds water. This is because, putting everything else aside, the purpose of anime is to tell a story. While it cannot be denied that artwork and music can enhance a story, &#039;production values&#039; are, by their definition, not a story based notion. These are often extras, that do not enhance the actual telling of a story.<br />
<br />
This now lead us all to &#039;009-1&#039;.<br />
This show is a misnomer. It is not about a war, exactly. It&#039;s real message is about war, generally. And its consequences. While the plot is based in an alternate reality, the consequences of parts of the story are lasting, and has an effect that weighs on, not only the characters; but the viewer as well.<br />
<br />
Our primary character, Mylene Hoffman; is the product of a war, that left her a refuge; eventually ending up in the Western Free World. With the aid of a government agency, she is not only hired, but bionically modified to enhance her survivability as an espionage agent.<br />
<br />
Her brother was abandoned, in a fashion that Mylene always regretted. Later she runs into him, now named Loki, working for the Eastern Bloc; and eventually both of them find out who each other is.<br />
<br />
And they find themselves still fighting the age-old struggles, against each other. Much regret from both individuals, and both try to give each other breaks from time to time. But in the end, neither one will quit their job, to find peace between themselves.<br />
<br />
This is a kind of sadness that is real, palpable, and happens every day; in real life. The flames of bonds of friendship or family, are often something that cannot be publicly recognized any longer. And yet we feel these regrets, that travel though our nightmares, like shadows of things seeming almost real, yet can no longer be touched. And we awake from the dream, knowing we touched that regret, but can&#039;t remember exactly what the cause was.<br />
<br />
And so dear readers, we have a story within a story. The primary story is the continuing struggle for dominance by the World Factions. The secondary story, stands much taller, and has more impact; for those of us with a strong enough soul to see the point intended by it.<br />
<br />
This secondary story is the story of many of us, who leave people behind; either voluntarily or by force. And regrets, for which there are many causes; and most of the time, leave us all scarred beyond the recognition of the people we left behind.<br />
<br />
009-1, cannot be enjoyed; but the effort to discuss regrets brought about by conflicts; can be satisfying for those of us with the wit to see and feel. 009-1 is a very rare anime, and is courageously made; regardless of whether it was hoped to be a financial or artistic success or not. Because the authors had something to say, they felt the viewer should know.<br />
<br />
For the viewer that has the courage to see within himself, and find corollaries to their own personal history&#039;s, 009-1 might just be your anime.<br />
<br />
I give &quot;009-1&quot; a very strong 8.<br />
<br />

    009-1 is action orientated scifi, set in an alternative universe where the cold war is still going on. 009-1 is a code name for a slightly cyborgivied, female version of James Bond who completes missions and kills agents of the Eastern Block with more or less ease, stays cool and sexy in dangerous situations and provides pretty good fanservice. <br />
<br />
While I enjoyed the series I think I&#039;m too young to enjoy it in it&#039;s full potential. Series isn&#039;t as old as you would guess just by looking at the art. Both music and the artwork look old, which without a doubt is the intention. 009-1

          <span style="display: none;" id="review64989">
        aims to breath life into the &#039;secret agent&#039; theme in action, which has lost some of its glamour during the past decade. To older viewers 009-1 can be a welcome breeze of nostalgia, but the younger generations might see old as just, well, old. In all honestly, the artwork was pretty unattractive to me: the heads seem to be shaped oddly and noses seem far too large. <br />
<br />
Most of the missions portrayed in the series are finsihed during one episode. One of the fortes of 009-1 are the bad guys: most of them have history and personalities instead of being just nameless enemies, destined to be killed by the heroine. 009-1 carefully and loyally maintains the stereotypical propaganda of evilness of the Eastern  Block that was typical for James Bond and the like, but still manages to make that evilness interesting and intricate.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, small and practically separate stories make the stroryline as a whole seem fragmented. 009-1 isn&#039;t as &#039;addicitve&#039; as many other series. There is very little to look forward to in the next episode, no cliff hangers or an actual progress in the story. While the last few episodes try to tie loose ends together and there are revelations from the heroines past, it isn&#039;t quite enough. It is as the series is done mainly for the secrent agent theme and action, not because there would be a story to tell. Sometimes the characters end up being only tools for the plot but in 009-1, the plot is just a tool for characters. <br />
<br />
If girls in action and secret agents are your thing, this series is definetly worth watching. If not, you will most likely end up waiting the real plot to unfold itself all up until the series ends. <br />

    Taking place during the Cold War which has continued pass the 90&#039;s. The Western and Eastern blocs attempt to gain a decisive edge on each other by utilizing spies, hitmen, and other strategic means. Working for the Western Bloc, Mylene Hoffman aka Nine-One, is a member of an all female group called the Zero Zero Agency. They&#039;re a group of intelligence spies equipped with various weapons through cybernetics. Myleen&#039;s arsenal consists of dual machine guns in her breast, ray gun, and needle guns in her boots. Her associates sometimes handle napalm explosives in their arms. Together or solo, this well trained group conducts espionage, undercover,

        or assassination operations.-summary<br />
<br />
009-1 is based on a late sixties manga by Ishinomori Shotaro and in regards to the show&#039;s stylish nature this is definitely something to take note of. The series is done in a very old school manner that will mainly appeal to those of that era; admittedly it does possess some modern traits but this anime is not for everyone. <br />
<br />
The manga was set during the Cold War. The anime follows its manga counterpart and pushes the Cold War beyond the nineties adding mutant children, advanced weaponry, cyborgs, and androids. 009-1 shares similarities to James Bond, but in many ways lacks the cleverness of the suave special agent. <br />
<br />
At first glance, 009-1 appears to be another chicks with guns anime series packed with fan service, mindless sex scenes, and very campy action scenes. Serious viewers could find it tough to get past the first episode. The first episode is action packed with a good amount of shoot outs and hand to hand scenes, but it has a very cheesy feel to it. Honestly, had I been watching this series seven years ago, I would have dropped it right away. Fortunately, these days I can watch almost anything. Therefore, when I do start on something I try my best to finish it no matter how painful it could be. <br />
<br />
Now, by the time the second episode arrives, the series takes a different turn and you soon realize you&#039;re not watching just another totally mindless girls with guns anime. The story mainly revolves around Myleen and develops her character through her solo missions. Even though Myleen is a professional and takes her job seriously. She often shows compassion to her victims loved ones and sometimes even to her targets; but she will deal out death to those whom she really believes deserves it. This bit of character depth is very much needed because Myleen comes off as a total sleaze. She sleeps with almost all of her targets and I&#039;m not into trashy characters such as these.<br />
<br />
This anime is plotless(until the last three episodes) and it follows an episodic format. Normally, anime like this would follow a certain predictable pattern. This follows a pattern somewhat, with almost every episode beginning slow paced, and later building up to an action packed ending but there is variety in the show. Some of the stories have great endings simply because they abandon all clichés. I&#039;ll leave this part up in the air to avoid spoilers; but I will say episode four stands as my favorite.<br />
<br />
009-1 is a watchable series yet has its flaws, and it doesn&#039;t reach its full potential. For one thing, Myleen is the only character whom is developed. The others in her squad receive no background and their roles are pretty much non existent. There really isn&#039;t much of an excuse for this, because at least two episodes served very little purpose. One in particular because I felt later on the subject concerning Myleen&#039;s compassion for others was a dead horse taking a beating. I also have a problem with some of the writing. I mentioned this series is similar to James Bond but minus the cleverness. I&#039;ll elaborate on this subject. While the character of James utilized wits, gadgets, and the story overall used strong, and imaginative writing to depict his escape from capture. Myleen was forced to resort to very uninteresting gimmicks such as the breast guns(which is so corny) and at least one time, her escape provided no explanation at all(how did she get out of those chains?), the writing can be way too weak.<br />
<br />
I also mentioned the sex scenes earlier. The scenes really don&#039;t hurt the series because they aren&#039;t graphic and are mainly left to your imagination, plus the series isn&#039;t packed with them as a desperate attempt to push the episodic plot. The ending was somewhat tacked on and it didn&#039;t provide enough closure.<br />
<br />
The biggest issue I have with this series is definitely the character designs. There was some effort put into the females of the series, especially, in the case of Myleen. They went out of their way to make her as sexy as possible, but too bad everyone else received the cold shoulder. The character designs are horrible especially for those use to more modern anime. The artwork for the backgrounds are just as bad at times. The buildings look almost like building blocks on some occassions. Other times, the artwork can be outstanding, especially, for the sunsets and night time backgrounds. The soundtrack was pretty good to me, but it could of used a few more songs. Overall, they fit very well with the series consisting of jazz and modern rock. The series also has solid voice acting. The English version contains a bit of foul language. I haven&#039;t seen the sub.<br />
<br />
009-1 surprised me early, admittedly because I set my expectations very low. It&#039;s an entertaining series that establishes its own identity, and doesn&#039;t always rely on cheap gimmicks; as for the artwork, I get what the intention is here but that doesn&#039;t mean I have to fully like it or like it at all.  I don&#039;t regret watching this series. However, if I had something better at the time, I would have put this on the shelf for a little while.<br />
<br />
Highs: Bloody action and action packed, decent stories, good music<br />
<br />
Lows: Very bad character designs, a bit of weak writing

    This anime is kinda old comparing to the day i&#039;m writting this which is 15-10-2015 this was realeased in 2006 so keep this in mind if you are considering watching this. I liked 009-1 it&#039;s a story about an special ops assasin that works for a company in security mainly, the action part is really good in the anime the plot itself kinda feels it could give us more. Watch this with the intent of watching an action based anime don&#039;t go for the story which is nice but nothing from the other world. Overall an good anime to pass the time watching and for

    009-1 is what happens when a slightly above average series goes under the radar of the average viewer and such has no real following. We end up in a place where the show is criminally under watched as there are things for viewers other than myself. <br />
<br />
To start with, it is more shocking that this even got an adaptation than anything else. The manga began serialization in 1967 and ended in 1974 whereas this adaptation came out in 2006. The age of the source material actually is why I have the complaints I have about the show. Everything that was original in the 60s a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339596">
        vast majority of the anime watching community had seen in 2006 and by even more people have seen these ideas now. That&#039;s the issue with age. Everyone does what you do. Thus we will talk about the quality of the show covering the lovely cyborg Mylene Hoffman<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
<br />
The show is a spy story with cold war themes. These are novel ideas for anime of today but we have seen stories like this before. Especially growing up in the west with James Bond and other spy movies. The story does have a couple of twists but not a ton. That&#039;s why it scores a 6 in my mind. However if you need a spy story go watch 009-1<br />
<br />
Art: 5<br />
<br />
The art was passable for 2006 and the age of some of the character designs showed through but still pleasant on the eyes. Nothing egregiously bad but nothing fantastic. Just average.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
<br />
Okay let&#039;s be honest, Destiny Girl is a banger and most people here probably have never heard it. Now aside from the opening, the ending and theme are the only other song I could pick out and they are fairly good as well. The background music is a lot of jazz style pieces and that is great but they aren&#039;t that memorable.<br />
<br />
Characters: 5<br />
<br />
I really wanted more time with our characters so that I could care about them more. 12 episodes just wasn&#039;t enough for this story and character development and that makes me sad. There was more potential here. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6<br />
<br />
A 6 is not a bad score. I enjoyed the show but I have seen a lot of this sort of thing before done in different forms of media and done better. But I still enjoyed the show. I just wish there were more episodes. Shame this will never get a second season.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
<br />
This is a fine show. Its above average and if you need a new spy show to watch, give it a shot. I wish there were more episodes, a second season or something. I just feel like more needed to be done with this cold war anime. <br />
But if you love jazz, spies, the cold war, and other intrigue following our main girl Mylene Hoffman then go right ahead and give this a watch. It will certainly pass the time in an enjoyable way as we all look back at older series.

    The story reminds me of sci-fi James Bond - it has good dramatic one-liners too. Some episodes were heartbreaking( I am talking about episodes 6 and 7 in particular) to watch. <br />
<br />
Even though the episodes are loosely connected to the main plot we find out more about agent 009-1 through the series but you don&#039;t get that rush to see what will happen next. You could easily drop off the anime at any given point. It&#039;s not Code Geass/Naruto/Bleach/One piece level of greatness but it is a good anime and I don&#039;t regret watching it.<br />
<br />
The art style is old fashioned - although I guess it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335123">
        was meant to be that way. Decent but not really pleasant for the eye - except agent 009-1. Speaking of her, the anime opening was a killer, I really liked it, I even downloaded it on my phone.<br />
<br />
Overall a very enjoyable anime to watch, a strong 6 /10 in my case.<br />

    I&#039;ve seen a lot of good anime already and when checking out a new show it&#039;s at times more exciting than anything else to find a work that&#039;s not just good but offers something unique that you rarely see in other shows. As you might have guessed, 009-1 is that kind of show. <br />
<br />
Art: the most &quot;your milage might vary&quot; part of the show. Personally I found character designs to be utterly inconsistent, some art style choices questionable and overall unfitting to the story. <br />
What&#039;s good:<br />
- all the clothing and hair styles are appropriate for the style of 70s spy fiction the show is aiming

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251998">
        for. Chic outfits and tight, skimpy dresses fit the strong and cunning but seductive characters of which there are many. It creates a stronger sense of aesthetic and atmosphere for the show.<br />
- most male characters vary wildly, making them easily recognizable (but at what cost) <br />
- the show has slightly disproportional bodies but it&#039;s always used to give characters more dynamic and powerful poses that accentuate their agility and prowess. <br />
What&#039;s bad:<br />
- most male characters are also way too cartoonish looking which doesn&#039;t fit the narrative, you don&#039;t want goofy goobers on the screen when everyone is talking about human experimentation, nuclear threat and cold blooded murder. <br />
- female characters aren&#039;t much better, while they are rather nice and attractive, they suffer too much from same face fever. At times I had to question if character on screen is our main hero in disguise or actually another woman. <br />
- eyes, this is a rather specific issue but it distracted me a lot. Everyone has two types of eyes, it&#039;s either a lifeless piece of colored glass or rocket pupils. Neither look good. At first I though the glass eyes are supposed to be a sign of cybernetic enhancements but that doesn&#039;t seem to be the case and why some characters have them seems entirely arbitrary. <br />
The rocket pupil eyes are less offensive, they just don&#039;t look good. I guess the two little circles are supposed to represent some kind of glimmer in their eyes but it just doesn&#039;t look like glimmer. <br />
Now onto backgrounds. I just briefly mention that they are bad. Low detail, bad color design, no sense of aesthetic consistency and at times perspective is so bad it looks like characters are living inside a cube world and what&#039;s in front of them is another side of cube, angled 90 degrees up from the one they are walking on. <br />
<br />
Animation: strong point of the show, I think every episode has at least one or two very well animated action sequences. The choreography is stylish and over the top, every hit looks like it carries a lot of power and pose to pose animation works well for depicting super human speed and strength on a limited budget. <br />
<br />
Direction: while overall the pacing is done well the framing is anything but. Good shots and camera movement are all too rare and this show is unlikely to leave many lasting impressions. The flows mentioned up to now are already enough to bring it down from recommended action show to a fun niche flick. <br />
<br />
Writing: 009-1 is an episodic spy fiction show that wouldn&#039;t stand out much if it didn&#039;t have a distinctly japanese spin on it. Our main heroine is a titular cyborg spy and while she is a little bit more developed than other one-bit characters, she for the most part remains a stoic strong woman who will do anything to complete her mission . However as the story goes on we are shown more of compassionate nature which makes her standing in the spy agency a bit more spicy as there&#039;s no place for empathy in a morally gray zone in her jobs black and white world view. This aspect of the show was actually rather interesting. While most episodes are self contained stories that have little importance overall, the viewer is constantly supplied with information about the world. We learn that both East and West bloc, two main faction left in the world which are currently at war with each other, have their own share of skeletons in the closet. We&#039;re not just seeing a cool badass wreck shit but make moral choices while doing so, which makes the story just a bit more involving and complex. <br />
<br />
Voice: really standard affair for anime, lots of theatrics but it&#039;s all well done. I like main heroine&#039;s VA in particular. She&#039;s very cold and disassociated a lot of the time which is harder to do well than it seems. <br />
<br />
Music: about what you would expect too. Nothing too outstanding but it&#039;s a nice mix of orchestral music and electronic beats that&#039;s common for spy movies and games. <br />
<br />
Fun factor: This show is flawed, very flawed. In fact first time I tried to watch it I dropped it. However after completing it I think it&#039;s a rather enjoyable spy action series that offers both a varied mix of short stories and quality animation of cool people doing cool things. It&#039;s a niche show but I&#039;d recommend it for people who have seen a lot of anime and want to see something fresh. It&#039;s not crazy out there but it&#039;s good either way.

    009-1 is one of those anime that I watched on a whim and while it initially failed to capture me due to a lack of proper story structure or a cohesive plotline up until the final three-or-so episodes, what little story there was did grip me as it came to highlight not just the secretive nature of the job Mylene Hoffman does as a spy for the Western Bloc if my memory serves me right? Her encounters with all sorts of characters throughout the series as well as the unraveling of her backstory is what really did drive me into the show. 009-1 is one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review379777">
        of those anime where there is little enjoyment to be derived from the story or the worldbuilding itself, but rather on the characters who inhabit it.<br />
<br />
Following Agent 009-1 as she showed compassion at the cost of the mission to those who needed it, mingled with multiple love interests and at the same time ruthlessly executed anyone who stood in her way, the departure of a story where a female character has no complexity to it was a great success for me. I enjoyed the many emotions 009-1 has to endure as she makes her journey across both sides of the country, the Western and Eastern Blocs to achieve her goals. There&#039;s moments of intense intrigue as well as levity, which makes the story stand out even more. Mylene Hoffman is the main, and practically only, reason to even watch this show in the first place which is both a boon and a bane at the same time.<br />
<br />
The unfortunate side of things rears its head when the realization is made that 009-1 really IS the only reason to watch this show for, as every other character is either one-note, insignificant or irrelevant to the episodic nature of the show and outside of 009-1&#039;s interaction with others, there isn&#039;t a lot of bone to sink one&#039;s teeth into when watching this anime. It was still enjoyable to watch but not something I&#039;d recommend if one is looking for a more story-driven show that breaks any unexplored territory. At the very end of it all, it&#039;s a run-of-the-mill show about an attractive spy lady doing expected things from a spy, though the occasional unexpected plot twist acts as a nice surprise whenever they do happen.
