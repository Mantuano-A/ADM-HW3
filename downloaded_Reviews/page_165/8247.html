    If I was a teacher, I&#039;d give Jouran an A for effort. It&#039;s got a pretty unique and interesting premise/world and the right ingredients to make a good show. Unfortunately, just effort isn&#039;t enough in life, and things didn&#039;t come together the way they could&#039;ve for Jouran.<br />
<br />
Decent action, good animation, and a pretty good OST aren&#039;t enough to patch up the holes in Jouran, and I think the final episode does a great job of summarizing the series as a whole; the right ideas but just too messy. The show is &quot;decent&quot; at best in my eyes, but I&#039;ll have to settle for a 3

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402574">
        given the clearly forced plot points and overreliance on cliches.<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
I like really liked the premise and world of Jouran: an alternate time period of Japan where the shogunate was never abolished mixed with some steampunk-ish vibes.<br />
<br />
That being said, the story is a generic, melodramatic revenge story, one many viewers have probably seen countless times.<br />
<br />
My biggest issue lies with the pacing. Book 1 was alright, Book 2 was messy, and Book 3 was a combination of both. We got some worldbuilding and important questions answered in Book 3, but there was a lot left unexplored that could&#039;ve bridged a lot of gaps.<br />
<br />
Aside from the pacing, Jouran makes abundant use of cliches as well. Is there anything wrong with cliches? Not really since it all comes down to how you use it. But Jouran&#039;s use of cliches was, well, cliche.<br />
<br />
Sike villain is actually someone close to the MC but double sike he had a good reason for his &quot;villainy&quot;. Oh sike, triple sike, he comes up clutch and sacrifices himself for the greater good. We also got the Asahi retcon, which felt very cheap and was solely used to force in a plot point for Book 3. Okay then.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
What I will give Jouran props for is its art style/animation. Not everyone is a fan of it, but I like the thicc, painting-like style animations the most. Not to mention the fight and transformation scenes are quite dope, although I think the actual fighting animations could&#039;ve been a tad better.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, the animation quality remained consistent through all episodes, which is very impressive considering how often we see dips in quality as the series progresses.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
OP and ED are very good and have a touch of those traditional Japanese tunes befitting a series set during a shogunate period. The OST used throughout the series was very nice as well and equally fitting for the time period.<br />
<br />
VAs did a great job as well, although I wasn&#039;t sure if Kuzuhara&#039;s VA was intentionally talking so muffled/quiet or if that was a processing issue. On that note, Book 2 seemed to suffer from a dip in audio quality with the lines sounding like Koikimo. It returned to normal in Book 3 but that sudden change was quite unexpected.<br />
<br />
Character: 2/10<br />
Similar to the story, you&#039;ll find lots of cliches in the characters. Elena was probably the most unique and interesting character out of the main cast. Without spoiling, Kuzuhara and Sawa are about as generic as you can get, Asahi is literally just a plot device and not even a character, and Tsukishiro is an even worse version of Asahi. <br />
<br />
Seriously, I still don&#039;t understand her (Tsukishiro&#039;s) character.<br />
<br />
This girl sets everything up so Sawa and Asahi can escape and live peacefully because she wants to set Sawa free, then turns around and says &quot;yea actually, I miss the old Kanye&quot; and does some weird shit. Huh?<br />
<br />
Then there was the freaky alcohol girl who was crying her eyes out after fighting Sawa and being spared. You&#039;d think she wouldn&#039;t return or would become a changed person, but then she appears in the finale and does that? Literally forced just so the series could have an &quot;emotional/moving&quot; ending. I mean, c&#039;mon, y&#039;all really couldn&#039;t think of a better way to deliver it?<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4/10<br />
As crummy as everything was, I wouldn&#039;t say the series is unwatchable. Certain &quot;patches&quot; of specific episodes and Books are actually quite good, but when it came to putting everything together it was too convoluted and all over the place. Watching Jouran is like riding a roller coaster: sometimes you&#039;re riding the high and enjoying the show/worldbuilding, but other times you&#039;re rushing down and watching things go up in flames all around you. The problem is the highs just aren&#039;t very high, and that makes for a pretty mediocre series overall when it could&#039;ve been so much more (I think if the content was spread over 16 EPs instead, this show would be really fucking good).

    Revenge, assassination, existence, repression and authoritharianism. All of those sound like ambitious topics for a 1920-ish ambientated anime with industrial fictional elements; sure, good things could come up from here. So then: what novelties does Jouran bring to the table while exploring those topics? Not many, or at least not enough to make itself remarkable over any other anime of its genre. Considering Jouran’s audience is already quite niche, I don’t think I would recommend anyone that is not completely passionate about all the revenge themes to go out of their way to watch it. If you are still interested though, let’s go on a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402543">
        deeper analysis of its pros and cons.<br />
Jouran: The Princess of Snow and Blood, was one of the titles that first caught my eye in this season. The trailer was absolutely gorgeous, and it seemed to have a great setting. So then, watching the first chapter surely was a disappointment; the world-building was messy, the animation was good, but a step down from the trailer and the moments that were supposed to be impacting were actually just confusing. Then once again the story changed completely in episode 4, and again in episode 9, in a way that was sometimes positive, sometimes negative. If you ask yourself about Jouran’s low rating on MAL, I would say that it’s not quite fair with the quality of the anime, but sure is truthful to all its letdowns and mislead expectations.<br />
But firstly, I’ll focus on Jouran’s biggest selling point, one that cannot be overstated: it’s artistic sense. Produced by a brand new studio, with a rather unspectacular staff and a director coming from the infamous studio GoHands, Jouran was likely doomed to be visually mediocre to say the least. Nonetheless, its trailers had already revealed that the staff knew exactly what they were doing, especially with the outstanding drawings of the transformations and battles, portrayed with thick lines of ink. Jouran, as I said previously, doesn’t have a top-notch staff nor incredible freelancer key animators (even though Hironori Tanaka animated the main scene of episode 4), but the production was conscious about its limitations and managed to produce a well-planned, quite consistent product. Even without insane fluidity, some strange filters on flashbacks and the character design getting quite big brain sometimes, Jouran is one of those animes that has a completely unique aesthetic. Impressing fights, gorgeous photography whit backgrounds that remind old japanese gravures are other parts of what I find to be a great planning overall.<br />
Going over the other technical aspects before talking about the story, I might remark that the direction is competent with the use of illumination and symbolisms. VA is fine, I guess, but I really want to highlight a certain scene involving a baby in episode 11, that was really well done. Moreover, sound design is mediocre and OST is good (actually, the op and ed, both from Raise a Suilen, are absolute bangers).<br />
And now, the main point here: Jouran’s plot. To further talk about it, I need to divide it into three parts, each one notably different from the others. I won’t spoil anything, but I might uncover the structure of the narrative.<br />
The first part is about revenge. The setting about assassins that work for an oppressive government and keep opposition in check is quite generic; the characters start being bland and there are some anachronisms, so this start is quite uncomfortable. Nonetheless, the animation sure is dope, there are stylish scenes and the cliffhangers are placed in the exact moments to make you interested in the next episode. Sure, I guess I will continue then… it’s not every day that you find such a bloody anime with good production values and 3 female leads. I guess it’s a 5 out of… man, episode 4 was complete fire wtf! Let’s keep watching then, I said.<br />
And then Jouran turned into something completely different. I didn’t know how to predict the plot anymore, the characters gained increasingly more depth and the anime started discussing a lot of existentialism about what is to live without a goal. Suddenly, Jouran was completely set apart from the similar other works I had seen until then, and a lot of potential emerged about what could come next… then I had hope Jouran could be among the best of the season, be a memorable tale about life… bleh (said the actual me)<br />
And finally, the conclusion. It was not easy to conclude in a satisfying way after all those questions that were raised in episodes 5-8, but Jouran somehow managed to do many of the difficult parts and still feel like it could have been much better. The ending has some questionable decisions here and there, that I won’t spoil, but at the same time the execution fulfilled almost every expectation I had by episode 8; so then, why do I find it underwhelming? Exactly because I could predict it from episode 8. Jouran, as I said, is far from being a bad show, or having a shitty plot, but it falls in the abyss of being irredeemably forgettable.<br />
With those great aesthetics and the potential unravelled by the 2nd part, Jouran could have been a remarkable story, but, far from being bad, it ended up being little more than generic. <br />

    &quot;The Suffering Tale of a Sweet and Poisonous Young Girl&quot; - Jouran can be defined simply by those words. As a new experimental work from 2021, Bakken Record Studio has the show as its second production and first broadcast weekly.<br />
<br />
The show begins with a perspective that intersperses underworld, government corruption, and work lurking and in the dark. Nue is a very strong and influential group in Japan, especially when it comes to their most important function: to ensure the security and political integrity of the country at any cost. In the same act we meet Sawa, the main character of the show, taking care of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402706">
        Asahi, her &quot;sister&quot;. In fact, the very coexistence of Asahi and Sawa is a matter to be considered as important for the construction of the show. It is interesting to realize that even though they appear to be good friends, the two hide a bloody past. Imagine that you are a very young child who lost your parents in a conflict. Asahi would be one of the thousands of children who would have this fate. Just as in reality, life is cruel and the anime does not hide this at any time. Even though Asahi internally seeks revenge, his immaturity and lack of experience is the cause of his failures. And even after his death, the show shows with a very impactful visual discomfort. Nowadays, there are few shows that can really have this creative freedom in using elements like these at every point in the story.<br />
<br />
Remember when I said that Jouran was a Tale? In fact, Jouran is a theater, composed of characters with exposed roles for the sake of the continuity of a drama that moves forward and reformulates itself over time. Our protagonist? A woman who, before the show even begins, has experienced immeasurable pain and loss, simply for her clan. In the anime, Sawa finds herself on a quest for revenge on her family, especially revenge on her brother. The drive that has driven Sawa since childhood is a prominent factor in the decent progression of the entire show. Even though Sawa fights and switches sides and opinions during her life, she always fights for justice and retribution of accounts. Tsukishiro is another important character within the show, in fact, a character to be better explained. He is the complete example of someone who has sold out to pursue a personal freedom. Even though we don&#039;t know his true intentions (for example, when he allies himself with Janome), Tsukishiro fulfills the role of a supporting villain as his role in revealing the mysteries and goals of the government are shown, based we treasures and by the blue blood of the Sawa Clan.<br />
<br />
Asahi is also a key player in Sawa&#039;s evolution as a character. In fact, Asahi is the main point that changes Sawa&#039;s perspective on the world. Since she entered Nue and was trained by Jin, she has had to suppress her more human emotions in order to perform her missions with prowess and precision, as a sign of trust and to further her own revenge. However, when reality is shown over Sawa&#039;s eyes, everything becomes a cataclysm and changes drastically. Throughout the show, Sawa has never cared about personal or loving relationships. Even the character in the first episode who teased her in the bookstore and the teacher who taught at the school where Asahi played with other children, all had trouble really effecting a change in Sawa&#039;s attitude. The perception of events and the trauma of suffering more prevented Sawa from still judging herself as a human. Many times the anime put her in a situation of internal conflict, where she made up her mind a few times to want to commit suicide, but without effect, because Jin would not allow it. All this exposition of happenings shows that Jouran exerts a depth both in the Japanese period in which it is told, and in the narrative function in which the show creates its plot. When Asahi&#039;s supposed death occurs, Sawa actually recognizes that he is still someone who can love and suffer and take someone in.<br />
<br />
And the word of the anime is: &quot;betrayal&quot;. Jouran has taken up the proceedings with this word. Jin&#039;s past, Nue, the allies, the government... All the groups and people who represent the show have suffered or betrayed for their own benefit. The national corruption in Japan, in Jouran, allows for creating situations where the death of characters is the solution to end these pursuits. Hana and Asahi (again) and Tsukishiro are practical and obvious examples. The show has competently and objectively exercised the reasons why it set up the conclusion of the story, without leaving serious problems of plot composition. Of course, this whole applied situation can reach a peak of confusion, where everyone is against everyone else, which can really displease, but I believe Jouran knew how to fit positively into this. The episode director and storyboard creator are to be congratulated, they pushed the show forward.<br />
<br />
On the production side, Jouran stands out very well. Even with general inconsistencies, the show uses beautiful artistic elements, such as texture and morbid perspective. The use of placements, mainly blue, red, and black, produce a contrast, while complementing the environment and the night time period, where most of the anime takes place. Not to mention the music, which was well interspersed, with the Opening and Ending being great. The red flowers, the artwork in a watercolor-like portrait, and the culture of verisimilitude managed to stand out clearly within each episode.<br />
<br />
Finally, Jouran deserves more recognition. It is a different show from the others, of course, you may not like it. It is an anime that doesn&#039;t encompass many positive reviews, but this time I ask: give it a chance. I was a person who looked down on this show, today I want to forget everything negative I said in the past. Jouran is indeed a worthwhile show.<br />
<br />
- In the end, everything is a cycle, it will always repeat itself.<br />
<br />
I would like to see a sequel to Jouran, with Asahi as the protagonist. It would be nostalgic and fun, I think...

    TL;DR Art, sound design and execution is one of the best I&#039;ve seen matching the mood. Story is quite average. Falls flat because of its (so far at least) convoluted nature about revenge with not enough details about the characters being shown. The voice acting is brilliant, the art style is clean and sleek yet moody at teh same time whilst maintaining clarity during fight scenes. Speaking of they&#039;re animated extremely fluidly rivalling most shounens out there, with brilliant use of light and dark elements and flashing colours to accentuate scenes.<br />
<br />
Story 6/10 - Basically a girl wanting to get revenge and to do so she

          <span style="display: none;" id="review393409">
        joins a shadow organization that removes all opposition for the ones they support. MC is some crazy op person when she wants to be and outside of her work seems genuinely caring. The story is all over the place so it&#039;s hard to follow most of the time but maintains a lot of Japanese cultural references, what with being set in japan anyways. Really a tragic story about revenge and is an anime original so I don&#039;t exactly know how this is going to cope moving forward since the story has been shaky so far, with not much to root for since it&#039;s just dark with no reason. At the moment I&#039;m not compelled to feel anything for the characters, merely just understand what they&#039;re feeling but I can&#039;t put myself in their shoes at all since the horrible direction they&#039;ve gone in establishing links with the viewer - or lack thereof.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10 - Breathtaking is the best way to describe it. Pathetic fallacy is used a lot, the background scenery is always dark and gloomy when it needs to be, almost painting a hue of darkness that emnates throughout the show and is light when it needs to be when the situation calls for a more positive scene, but still maintains a sort of eerieness as it contrasts to what we&#039;re used to. The fights are crazy, as though manga has come to life with thick brushstrokes that contrasts well with the sharp lines before in conversation-driven scenes.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10 - Again brilliant, BGM elevates scenes that much more with it empowering the emotions behind the scene and coincides incredibly well with whats happening. Music always maintains a thick deep undertone that is extremely murky with the op taking inspiration from traditional Japanese scores sticking true to the anime being a historical piece.<br />
<br />
Character 7/10 - Characters are okay, somewhat unique and understandable for the most part, but due to lack of a coherent backstory and the dependency of revenge being a recurring motif without actually explaining why the revenge means so much detracts from the overall characters a lot.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall 7/10 - Due to lack of a story that actually flows well, its hard to follow, but the animation and soundscape is mind boggling. I hope the anime takes a Christopher Nolan approach where it confuses us in the beginning but the redemption occurs later that makes everything coherent near the end. Have not got high hopes for that to come true but colour me surprised if that happens.<br />

    This anime has so many different views and different opinions regarding its storyline/ general outcome.<br />
<br />
First, I would like to state my opinion then explain. Overall, (4 episodes in) the anime took a stand in my fav shows list which is a good start. For a person like me, personally, I love historical themed stories. Swordsmanship included? that&#039;s the kind of shows/stories I personally like. <br />
<br />
However, I respect the bad reviews that run back and forth and understand what they see.<br />
<br />
Long story short. Storyline? So far, the story is not that intense, and how I imagined it at first but I can see the progress going

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395044">
        to my first impression.<br />
Revenge stories are always heartache but when it comes to using badass characters it just added that spice to the whole show. <br />
<br />
Art? MAGNIFICANT! I am so obsessed with the art style that is used to deliver this show. Huge thumbs up for that. <br />
<br />
Sound? the voice acting is rather average. However, I did notice a sound fail that I ignored completely in the 2nd or 3rd episode. When she was recalling and the background music was playing which then got cut in a silly way.<br />
<br />
Finally, every one has different taste in shows. I understand, this show is not for everybody but if given the fair chance it might grow in your eyes eventually. <br />
<br />
P.S. Jouran the princess of snow and blood does not deserve this rating at all.

    Revenge. Revenge. Revenge.<br />
<br />
A tale of revenge in many forms. But how does it fair? Let me explain.<br />
<br />
Art and sound<br />
I would like to start this off with this, mainly because in many parts of this show, the art can look straight out of a game, a good well polished game. Further shown during the battle scenes, but in general. In general, the art style has a bit of a dark sense. It looks grim, and fits the themes in general. But in a good way. With the sound adding that much needed touch, to make it all stand out well. Both are very high qualities for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review393402">
        this show for sure, with the animation looking crisp and good, and the sound being fit for purpose. A high point for this show for sure. The OP is a banger for sure.<br />
<br />
Story and characters<br />
As explained, the entire story mainly revolves around revenge. With our lead having lost their family, and now is brought in to this clan to be trained, under the impression she&#039;ll get her revenge one day. Which fuels her motivations. A pretty simple story, but one that&#039;s easy to follow, that I&#039;d honestly say can be good parts, but can be a bit of a mess in others. It&#039;s not the best, but it&#039;s certainly not bad either, and does give off entertaining moments. <br />
<br />
As for the characters themselves. They&#039;re a mixed bag. In that, some of them don&#039;t seem like very good people at all. As if their motives are straight up just dickish. Which I suppose will add more conflict to the show, which can only be a good thing hopefully. We have our lead, who basically runs a bookstore, and taken in a child of a target she eliminated, who said child is being pressured for revenge too, but not by her. But you can tell from that, this isn&#039;t some cutesy hero story. This cast will be dark, grim, and mostly in it for their own needs. Something at least different for sure.<br />
<br />
Jouran can look pleasing art wise, and sound wise, but like the saying goes. Don&#039;t judge a book by it&#039;s cover. It won&#039;t be the worse anime of this season by any means. It&#039;s better then that, and it can get better then it is at the moment. Which is why I suggest to keep watching, as it does provide entertaining watch.

    Whenever I come across original anime, my first instinct is always to scrutinize the production staff team and see what are their past records, because that&#039;s always a very good indication if the anime could shoot for the moon, or in the case of Jouran: The Princess of Snow and Blood, be the sub-servience of another mediocre shot at hiring non-recognizable names and making generic stuff, just to waste all that money down the drain for some other anime or even mixed-media projects that could be made better and make all that effort worth its run.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d swear: take a look at the staff team, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402532">
        only a minority have works to their name, albeit in varying degrees of success viable across the board. You have old-timer director Susumu Kudou, which aside from the terrifying work that is Dies Irae some years ago, has some impressive work under his belt, like the Mardock Scramble series...that is very dated to more than a decade ago. Sound director Yuuichi Imaizumi has also some notable works under his name (e.g. Jashin-chan Dropkick!, and one of my absolute favorite half-episode length shorts: Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san) that is worth the apt, to even the music director Michiru (Given, Isekai Bookworm and many more). Alas, the other majority that covers the show are no-names, as in the case of the story and plot tremendously holding back due to it sounding like a child&#039;s play, and my long-time complaint of creating new studios that are only temporary solutions to a never-ceasing problem.<br />
<br />
With even a generic story, if the setting is unique enough, then it warrants some attention, and Jouran&#039;s settings are indeed just that: a Princess Princpal steampunk-like alternate Japan where both tradition (Shogunate) and modern (experimental) values meet, even down to the episode titles which are totally 100% like said show. However, unlike Princess Principal, the story while made original, it just feels like a ham-fisted sequence of events where said character(s) are tasked to do what they&#039;re told to do because it&#039;s a deadly world out there, and failure is not by choice or reasoning. Furthermore, given that the 3 monthly arcs (or books as they&#039;re categorized) are meant to showcase the timeline of events that happen in the show, it kinda defeats the purpose of trying to mimic the Princess Principal style of naming them as &quot;Confidential File No. XXX&quot;, because they&#039;re meant to be unorthodoxies for the audience to watch back those episodes in a chronological order to get the feel for how everything started out with as opposed to the broadcast order. While Jouran managed to imitate that aspect with decency, it lost a lot of its unique appeal by conforming to the orthodox standard (the monthly Book arc pacing) with such a linear story that is easy to follow, yet at the behest of retaining watch values due to how sluggish the story and plot can be, which is much or less a heavily revenge-based show that has no redemption values whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Sadly, the characters in this story that are meant to tell that exact story, kinda goes wishy-washy over its convolutional methods of &quot;Must I do this to get back my revenge and my enemies&#039; just desserts?&quot;. The central female MC Sawa &quot;Yuki&quot; Karasumori, hailing from your typical family clan but with a cavier&#039;s level of caveat: their &quot;blue blood Changeling transformation&quot; power is infectiously powerful, for the one that wields it is able to overthrow enemies, to even being a catalyst of control for a big city like ancient 20th Century Meiji Era alternate Japan standards. Her reason of joining a group of executioners called the Nue is just to seek revenge of her past memories of her clan&#039;s annihilation, though the ambition of this secretly-formed organization has been solely made to aid the Yoshinobu Tokugawa faction against insurgents who are aiming to overthrow the Shogunate. From taking care of an abandoned child (Asahi Nakamura) to getting along with the Nue members (Elena, Makoto and leader Jin), the journey of the Princess of Snow and Blood is a deadly one, where personal feelings and emotions will not be tolerated in the face of missions to seek out the embodiments of life so tragic and predictable. Throughout the course of the show, I can get why Asahi is there to help Sawa progress with her character development, but for the Nue organization, its members, the subpar villains (Janome and the Shogunate) and the rest, it just feels like characters designed and monitored to trigger death flag events as and when the story development needs to get going, and that will always be a make-or-break point if the story isn&#039;t strong enough to channel back and forth. It sure took some convincing to do, but at a forced level to be put in their shoes.<br />
<br />
From the anime announcement to behind-the-scenes production and then full-on release, it only took less than 2 months to get this show done, which is insanely and redonculously fast for a show that mostly depends on the 2DCG computerized mish-mesh to dish out animation, especially on the aesthetic of what supposed to look like well-animated fight choreography, with all the flare and none of that hand-draw tradition work, which saves production costs but at the sacrficial cost of quality. I&#039;d say that this is one of the most unique shows by animation levels alone, and how Bakken Record managed to channel that choreography like it went all-out with it is kinda nice, to not put a damper on delivering through animation (if all else falls apart). Just don&#039;t expect Ufotable&#039;s Demon Slayer levels of quality, even if there are similarities in its action-packed thematics.<br />
<br />
Music is just so-so, but it&#039;s RAISE A SUILEN for the OST, so BanG Dream! fans have enough to rejoice over new songs from the band. Otherwise, it&#039;s non-existent for the most part.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve often hear this heresay everywhere that &quot;Why Aren&#039;t More Original Anime Made?&quot;, and it&#039;s a very good foundation and morale story behind people and studios who want to go on this extraordinary route, which is totally unlike the manga/LN adaptation landscape. Playing &quot;safe&quot; show concepts that uses existing tropes and clichés is almost a given, because at the end of the day, it&#039;s a business model that will evenutally have people sold on the idea. With that said, translating that to the audience is a totally different matter by itself, and like what I&#039;ve said at the beginning, while heaps of money and resources has been spent on this mediocre show, there&#039;s no turning back even if the final product&#039;s good or not. Jouran falls in the latter space, and while it is not the worst anime of the season, it definitely comes off as either you love it or hate it. Good try to set expectations low, but please pan out a better story next time.

    &quot;Joran: The Princess of Snow and Blood&quot; is a bit of an odd show, in a lot of ways. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s premise is fairly simple, at least at the start. You&#039;ve got a early twentieth-century setting, a young woman driven by revenge working as an assassin for an oppressive regime, primarily out of practicality, to find the man who killed her parents. Nice and simple. As the story unravels, it adds a lot more complexity to the setting; a double agent here, a betrayal there. Despite that, it&#039;s easy to settle into what the story clearly is, there&#039;s a clear theme here that you&#039;d expect to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402558">
        reach a fairly simple but satisfying conclusion. <br />
Indeed, up until the final moments of the final episode, this conclusion stays obvious. And I don&#039;t mean that in a cynical way, it&#039;s obvious because the story has, for the most part, been coherent and competently told. And then it just sort of... doesn&#039;t. Without clear spoilers, the show pulls a final twist (and it does like a twist) on the audience, which on the one hand isn&#039;t necessarily *badly* done, the emotional side hits well enough, it&#039;s well done. But it also feels like it undermines the entire journey of the story, in a very bizarre and confusing way. Again, not in an &#039;it doesn&#039;t make sense&#039; sort of way, but in a &#039;what were the people making this trying to say with this?&#039; kind of way. <br />
<br />
As mentioned, the show likes a tragic twist, it pulls them out every three episodes or so, and to the show&#039;s credit, the final undermining ending should have been foreshadowed by the fact that most of them have little effect on the story. <br />
<br />
And yet, the worst I can say, despite all of this, is that I think the show is odd. Because the thing is, despite that, despite those last few episodes sort of dropping the ball, I actually did really enjoy this show. I loved the production design and the general atmosphere of it, I found the characters interesting and unique and cared about the protagonist&#039;s journey. I liked the soundtrack a lot, feeling modern but very period appropriate. And I really enjoyed the animation side, especially in fight scenes, which have a very unique feel and design to them, backed by an interesting supernatural concept. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, I did like this show. I just wish that, when the chips were all down and it was trying to say whatever it was trying to say, it didn&#039;t seem to have forgotten what that was.

    One of the better anime of this season -- excellent art and music. The story is a bit generic and a lot of characters tropes are common but it&#039;s still a decently well-rounded anime. I like the setting a lot (cyberpunk but the shogunate was never dissolved) and the anime doesn&#039;t spoon feed any information (it&#039;s a show anime, not a tell anime).<br />
<br />
The main character is quite interesting, but the rest of the cast as mentioned is nothing unique. That doesn&#039;t make them bad of course, and I think the cast is still well rounded.<br />
<br />
Music and anime is possibly one of the best in the

Story/Plot 7/10 - Plot is basically revenge. We got Sawa, having to avenge not one but TWO people now, (Her brother, and sadly, now Asahi. (She could be alive, but when I&#039;m writing this it&#039;s not confirmed if she lived.)) most people say this anime isn&#039;t well paced, but I feel like the pacing is pretty good. The first episode was really slow though, but besides that from episode 2 until now it&#039;s been pretty well paced. Asahi&#039;s &quot;death&quot; (Again not confirmed she&#039;s dead.) made me almost cry, and I got really mad. I sure hope she&#039;s not actually dead, but only time will

<br />
Art/Animation 9/10 - Out of all the anime I&#039;ve seen so far this season, this by far has the best art. It&#039;s beautiful, the colors are perfect, and the animation is really smooth!<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10 - Sounds the same as other anime. Voices are good.<br />
<br />
Characters/Personalities 7/10 - I hated Sawa at the beginning because of her personality back then. Now she&#039;s one of my favorite characters in the anime, and I love her! Asahi is adorable and amazing, I was very attached to her and her personality was a great contrast to Sawa&#039;s. I just sure hope she&#039;s not actually DEAD! Everyone else&#039;s personalities for the most part are also good!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall 7/10 - So far, this anime is pretty good. Slow start, but it&#039;s gotten way better the farther the anime went on. It keeps me on the edge of my seat every time there&#039;s a new episode, and as I said like 10000 times, I almost cried at Asahi&#039;s death. Yea, anyways pretty enjoyable and can&#039;t wait to see where the anime goes! :3<br />
<br />
                                                 ----------<br />
DUDE! The ending was phenomenal! Like, I&#039;m sad that Sawa ended up dying, but older Asahi is adorable, and it seems like there&#039;s gonna be a sequel! I&#039;m beyond hyped and can&#039;t wait to see it! :D<br />

    There are series that you like and you go “well, that was cool, what shall I watch next?” once you finish them. Others that you really like and make you go “That was Awesome, I’m gonna read some stuff about it on the internet”. And then, there are series that leave you speechless, unable to move from your seat and leave such a strong impression in you that you know right away that they’ll stay with you forever. Joran is one of those series.<br />
Now, first things first: Why the hell am I giving such high praise and top score to a series series that seems

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402936">
        to be so impopular and underwatched among anime fans? Well, you see, Joran is not a rom-com that repeats the same unfunny joke a million times, and it certainly doesn’t have the word isekai in its tittle so I guess it was never bound to be popular among fans in the first place.<br />
Jokes aside, once we know what Joran isn’t (this is no isekai rom-com, that’s for sure), let’s talk about what Joran is and why I consider it to be a masterpiece.  Whithout getting into spoilers, the series is set in the early 30’s in some kind of alternative Japan (although it does look quite realistic, to the point that there are some scenes that feature radio broadcasts that sound as if they were taken straight from that period. I really loved that detail) and it’s centered on a special group created by the government to fight against insurgents. One of the members of said group is Yukimura/Sawa, who has some kind of special powers,  and the series focuses mainly on her story and interactions with the other 3 members of the group as well as her little sister. <br />
 What makes Joran (or Jouran, as it can also be written) great and separates it from other series with a similar premise is how emotionally powerful and gripping it is. It’s hard to talk about it without spoliers so let’s just say that there’s a permanent sadness and melancholy that impregnates every scene that somehow make this series to be closer to stuff like Jin – Roh (which happens to be my favorite movie ever, anime or otherwise) or Casshern Sins. Of course, this slow pacing and somber mood might to be to everyone’s taste, specially considering how gloomy and sad the world already is. But I firmly belive that it’s in hard times like these that pure, heartfelt masterpieces are more necessary than ever. And, make no mistake, Joran: The Princess of Snow and Blood is one of those.   <br />

    Visually pleasing.<br />
<br />
This is an anime original show and is it good? Well kinda. It has its moments but not every scene or episode is perfect, but it does have so amazing animation and art considering this is the studios first anime<br />
<br />
So the story is about this woman named Yukimura Sawa who kinda does weird stuff. She is the owner of a book store but she has a secret side. She can transform into this monster things. Mostly she just kills others like her and try to stop some crimes. I honestly don&#039;t remember much of the story.<br />
<br />
Characters are somewhat well-made. They aren&#039;t the greatest but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402561">
        they are not the worst. Sawa herself is kind and caring but can also be feisty when it comes to saving people.<br />
<br />
The opening fucking slaps. It sounds so great. They background music is also pretty pleasant.<br />
<br />
I guess i&#039;ll give like a 7. It is fun but the story is a mess and forgettable.

    What a mess! <br />
<br />
<br />
English is my third language so try to forgive any grammatical mistakes<br />
<br />
******WARNING******** THIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Joran: The Princess of Snow and Blood started out as a your typical revenge story, Sawa&#039;s parents were killed by an unknown person and she seeks revenge from him for that. And the only clue she has about him is the scars (?) on his back that she saw the night her parents were killed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
If I could summarize the story with one word it would be &quot;Mess&quot;. Joran seemed like it had 40 different writers, eacgh with a completely different plot in mind, but at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402510">
        the end they settled for 5 or 6 of them, then they decided to stuff all of these convoluted ideas into the show. You realise that by the time you have finished episode 4. If the show ended by episode 4 my score would be significantly higher and I wouldn&#039;t be here writing this. The story in itself ended like 3-4 times before its proper &quot;conclusion&quot; which (ironically enough) is way less conclusive than episode 4. Too many things were left unexplained. Entire characters make no sense. All of the fights are  same (literally) so you can&#039;t even enjoy the overly-cliche&#039;d part of the story, the action sequences are all as follows: Sawa encounters enemy, enemy beats Sawa, saw uses her blood powers, Sawa turns the fight around. They all go the exact same. If you want you can really skip the action scenes because they are the most boring part (which is hilarious to me). By the end of the story half the cast would have the blue sacred bood somehow even though the clan supposedly went extinct long ago (except for Sawa). Characters<br />
Die on screen then it turns out they are alive with no explanation to anything whatsoever, and it happened so many times that death lost its value. When a character dies I just don&#039;t know how I&#039;m supposed to feel. I just go like &quot;oh well they will bring him after 2 episodes or something&quot; <br />
Art and animation :<br />
<br />
The characters models are unique-ish but oversimplified which is what would you expect from an original anime so it&#039;s not really a major complaint for me, however the backgrounds are so ugly!! There is a reason that the backgrounds are dark most of the time (not only to serve the story theme). It is because they are lazy and they lack substance!. They all feel dead as if it is literally a painting drawn by a middle-schooler but had some polishing after-words. <br />
The colors are very trash in my opinion, when you pair oversimplified but unusual character models with the ugly and dark-y and the oil-y and unfitting coloring you will endup feeling a little nauseous at times. <br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
The animation is my personal favorite part about Joran. The animation is really nice. Which puts some worth on watching the action scenes. It&#039;s true that it does feel EXTREMELY janky at times (especially in non-action character movements). But for some irrelevant anime that nobody talked or will talk about, and had little to no advertisement. The animation is pretty impressive!<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound : THE OP SLAPS! IT&#039;S VERY GOOD. ONE OF THE BEST THIS SEASON! The acting is also good but gets old really quickly (somehow). The osts are Meh mostly and the Ed is garbage. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
<br />
YikeS, there are no characters here. Only plot devices. Even Sawa herself is a plot device. The characters just do things, either without a motive, or when they have a motive it is an overused motive like (acquiring the blood) or just a questionable motive at best. When the writers want a character to die they just kill it without no buildup by making character act very irrationally and so out-of-character so that they can progress the plot as they please. They introduce a character and after 10 minutes it&#039;s killed. The only okay-ish character would be Jin. his motives make sense. His actions were fairly rational. But he was way too clichéd imo but atleast he isn&#039;t bad. But he&#039;s way way better than Sawa. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: <br />
<br />
Up until episode 4 I had a somewhat decent experience however by each episode I kept losing interest. By the last episode I was pretty much forcing myself to look at the screen. The only episode I genuinely enjoyed after ep 4 was the Jin character arc episode (forgot which one was it) <br />
<br />
Overall : too many ideas stuffed into a one-cour show resulted in a hot load of garbage <br />

    Jouran: The Princess of Snow and Blood is an anime original made by studio Bakken Record. Jouran is set in 1931, known for one of Japan&#039;s most infamous and fraught eras. We follow a cast of assassins who carry out tasks for a peculiar agency. However, there is more than meets the eye and it gives the impression that the cast is complex with their own motivation and goal that forced each individual on the path of assassination. Jouran is not afraid to shrink away from more mature themes such as rape, violence and kidnapping, so be mindful if you can&#039;t handle such themes.<br />
<br />
But the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402704">
        main protagonist of Jouran is a seemingly emotionless and cold female called Yukimura. Yukimura is a mysterious girl, to say the least with many attributes of her identity not revealed until later episodes. She&#039;s fueled by revenge from her past struggles and hints of the mysterious &quot;ryumyaku&quot; energy that acts as a source of her powers.<br />
<br />
The visuals and tone alone are gorgeous and work very well when it comes to presenting the mysterious, mature, and gritty nature of the story. The fighting sequences are probably the best thing Jouran has going for it with the polished art style and its gorgeous use of color splashes of blue and black. It lends a different sort of mythological element to the fight scenes while enhancing the inhumanity of Yukimura when she transforms into her alternate &quot;form&quot;.<br />
<br />
While Jouran&#039;s story inches towards the more convoluted side which could be a hit or miss. I think it&#039;s at least worth recommending to viewers who like grim historical anime with a twist of the supernatural. <br />

    Jouran: The Princess of Snow and Blood started off as an anime with high potential. An anime original with a decent budget and a unique artstyle set in an alternate reality 1930s Japan. I wanted it to be good. I think we all wanted it to be good. But Jouran devolved into one of the biggest trainwreck anime this season.<br />
<br />
The story is the show&#039;s biggest problem. Our protagonist, Sawa, is set up with a straightforward revenge plot, however the revenge plot is resolved in the first four episodes. The show didn&#039;t build up any real direction or momentum beyond the revenge arc, and following that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402699">
        there isn&#039;t any established direction for which the show is going to head for the rest of the season. It&#039;s a jumbled mix of different plots that don&#039;t particularly relate aside from the same cast is present in all the plots. There are numerous fake-out deaths, even multiple times for some characters. It feels hard to care about anything that happens onscreen because you&#039;re not sure if it&#039;s even possible for the main cast to die. <br />
Despite all this, there were numerous plots that I did enjoy. There are many thrilling moments and enjoyable story beats, however they are ruined by the lack of a cohesive story and the indecisiveness way the characters were handled.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves actually started rather interesting. The main cast we are introduced to are all working together as members of a government run assassination force called Nue. All the members work together, but seem to each harbour a deadly secret that may some day threaten the rest of the cast. However many of these secrets amount to nothing. The plot continues, and one by one all the characters are put in situations and make decisions that are ridiculous, unrealistic, and nonsensical. The characters are slowly broken down and destroyed by the poor choices of the plot until there are no interesting characters left. <br />
<br />
I have to admit though, the OP was a banger. The music overall is fairly solid. It didn&#039;t particularly stand out and mostly adhered to the mood of the scenes. <br />
<br />
Overall Jouran: Princess of Snow and Blood was a fever dream that was ruined by a messy, nonsensical plot. I went into Jouran with reasonable expectations, however I quickly found that having any expectations at all will ruin the experience. If you for some reason genuinely do want to try out this show, either out of a sick, twisted sense of curiosity, or just to add another season to your anime list, it is best watched when you&#039;re feeling tired or unfocused, when you can turn your brain off and look at all the pretty pictures on the screen. <br />
<br />
4/10 do not recommend unless you have a brain disease.

    The Princess of Snow and Blood is like a Meiji-era version of the first few minutes of RWBY, but the main character&#039;s goal is a disappointing revenge.<br />
<br />
Story: Not very compelling. There&#039;s a drug that the Shogun wants but apparently no other important party is after it. The subplot of overthrowing the Shogun&#039;s government seemed more interesting but doesn&#039;t get much development besides a few quick scenes here and there and then a climax slapped at the end. 3/10<br />
<br />
Art: This is why I made the comparison with RWBY. The art is beautiful, the animation is smooth when it counts, and the fight choreography really is like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402641">
        a dance at times. 10/10<br />
<br />
Sound: Nothing particular stood out. It was hard to feel emotionally invested in most scenes, though the transition to the ending theme in the last episode was done well. 6/10<br />
<br />
Character: ...This category was the worst. With a protagonist bent only on revenge to the point of treating the people around her like they&#039;re worthless in the first few episodes, I couldn&#039;t root for her. The other Nue executioners were also boring outside of their fight scenes. The only character I liked was Asahi; you just want her to be happy. 2/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I didn&#039;t watch this anime for the story or the characters, but rather the action. The animation kept me going. 4/10<br />
<br />
Overall: I don&#039;t recommend this anime. I&#039;m sure you can find clips of the best parts online and learn more about the Meiji era and Tokugawa Yoshinobu from a quick Google search. 6/10

    Ah...revenge stories. I personally love a good revenge show. They always make me want to root for the main character when they can finally achieve their revenge. Or, if it&#039;s a redemption sort of story, the transformation that the character goes through towards freedom, inner peace, and the future also makes me feel good inside.<br />
Jouran truly goes through the motions and touches the surface of what constitutes of a redemptive revenge story, but fails completely in execution and storytelling. It&#039;s one thing to rush a story, and another to just obliterate any character development or personality in favor for rushing through mediocre predictable rabble.<br />
Jouran attempts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411968">
        to do what Vinland Saga did in 24 episodes in nurturing a boy flooded with rage and desire for revenge in four episodes. In those four episodes, it also tries to foster a bond between siblings similar to what Dororo did in 24 episodes. It also tries to incorporate a &quot;secret organization&quot; that Sawa is a part of, in which she has to escape in order to truly be free of their clutches, refusing to do bloody work for them.<br />
It&#039;s too surface level because it rushes through everything that makes the story worthwhile. Whats it to me if Sawa manages to escape her impeding clutches when I do not give a damn about her since there is nothing for me to like? What is it to me that Asahi tries to save Sawa when their bond is forced and weak?<br />
What do I really know about Sawa? Everything I know about her is given through intermittent flashbacks tagged along with dull dialogue with fellow secret organization &quot;executioners&quot; that have as much personality as a piece of wood. Tsuki and her entire subplot is lost because I don&#039;t understand her motives until the story decides to give me a direct explanation with awkward monologuing. There is no arc in the story that develops Sawa as a character. Sawa needed to at least have her relationship with Asahi to be genuine, but what do I see? Zero bonding moments, spur of the moment actions, and lack of any genuine self reflection and comprehension. In the end, Asahi is a mere plot device so that Sawa has something to care about after her revenge was over. In reality, Asahi&#039;s entire personality is dependent on Sawa. There is no depth, and Sawa acts with complete ambivalence and contradiction throughout the story. She somehow internalizes the fact that she prioritizes Asahi through direct confrontation with the threat of her death in order to accelerate plot. There was no bonding moments, but rather a forced plot element that makes Sawa progress as a character, and this is a trend that keeps on happening. Nothing about Sawa feels genuine, and that can be said for all of the characters. When there are random characters that influence the plot, that confront Sawa and Asahi, I really start to lose interest. When Sawa and Asahi are just as bland as the rest of the cast of characters, I lose interest.<br />
I should care when Asahi gets saved by Sawa. I should be tense when Asahi tries to save Sawa from Nue. I should feel a release, as well as a joy when Sawa manages to live a &quot;peaceful&quot; life. I should feel joy for Sawa when She gets her revenge. But I don&#039;t, and the reason is simple. Sawa nor Asahi get any love or development that is more than a plot device. Every event is just like a checklist for the plot. There is the bare minimum of dialogue and character interaction for the plot to make sense, but even then, it&#039;s not good. There absolutely needed to have more time for character relations, and personalities to shine through. If the plot is not brilliant and is predictable, and the characters abandoned in favor of plot development, then what you have is a barely functioning show.

    Recommendation: Skip it unless you really want to look at the pretty art and animation.  That&#039;s about all it has going for it.<br />
<br />
Joran is the dictionary definition of style over substance.  It has a very unique and flashy visual look, the action is very eye-catching and well-animated, and the plot is irredeemable garbage.  For a while it looked like it was going for &quot;so bad it&#039;s good&quot; territory, but it ended up not even giving us that, it was just regular bad in a not fun way.  Characters get killed off regularly for cheap drama and then brought back to life

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403188">
        without explanation for even cheaper drama.  Characters and their motivations rarely make sense and they act in highly contradictory ways just to be unpredictable.  The melodrama is so over the top that it has zero impact.  The ending is laughably pointless and nihilistic.  <br />
<br />
Without the action scenes this would probably be one of the worst shows I&#039;ve seen, but goddamn do they make it tempting to recommend anyway.  It&#039;s not ultra-high budget but has a highly stylized look to it that&#039;s absolutely gorgeous.  It makes excellent use of colors and big, thick lines to look unlike anything else you&#039;ve seen, in a good way.  It&#039;s a bit corny, but when Sawa delivers her catchphrase and begins transforming, it actually does get you excited a little bit to see what&#039;s about to unfold.  She&#039;s a cool protagonist that can pull off lines that would be cringeworthy if they were delivered by someone else.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a real shame this show has absolutely nothing going for it beyond the pretty action scenes.  That level of artistic vision really deserved a better vehicle than this below average soap opera.<br />
<br />

    The most noticeable thing about the anime was the unique animation. The texture and contrast of the characters felt different. The action and transformation scenes felt like paintings with this animation style. I enjoyed the uniqueness of the style and how it different it made the atmosphere feel.<br />
<br />
My major problem with the anime was the usage of premise and characters. Even though it took place in historical era, the premise took a fantastical direction with special fuels that could make special weapons and warriors. Because of this, the actions were pretty decent.<br />
<br />
However, instead of doing more with the premise, the story became a small-scale and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402892">
        typical revenge quest that I have seen before. The scale of the story could potentially be good because there would be more time to focus on the characters. However, the main character, Sawa, felt typical and not too special, but her relationship with her ‘sister,’ Asahi, was sweet and got me a bit invested. <br />
<br />
The ending was disappointingly anticlimactic. It could have made the sacrifice and redemption of a character more glorious and justified. The ending felt like nothing, and more like a fast way to wrap up the plot because the amount of episodes weren’t enough. <br />
<br />
Overall, it had potential with the premise, but the story went for a mediocre route with beautiful animation. 6/10

    So, it’s not my intention to convince you that this is the underrated gem, ok? Because it isn’t. People did score it pretty well. Yet, I found it more enjoyable than the mean score would imply so I will share my perspective on it. While at it I should mention that love history, philosophy, and tragedy in my anime, so if you don&#039;t - stop, and move along. Spoilers present (but like not overly detailed).  <br />
<br />
Summary. It’s the 20th century and The Tokugawa shogunate is a thing of the past. Violent repression, censorship, and reserves of magical energy are all that keep this social

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402810">
        structure from crumbling. Even the small disagreement with the regime spells instant death. As energy reserves dwindle and its control slips, the political stage is ready for a major change. In the midpoint of the soon-to-be revolution is Sawa. She is the regime’s executioner (cleaner, if we are being honest), hell-bent on killing a responsible for the massacre of her clan several years prior. By some crazy coincidence, that person is the head of the rebellion, a mad scientist called Janome.<br />
Ok. As you could see, world-building is ok, nothing too detailed or innovative. The background is there when writers need it. As for a storyline, it has three parts, called books (so we know we are sophisticated viewers hehe). Each book has its mood and focuses on a different aspect of revenge.<br />
<br />
Book 1 &quot;An Open Season For Jerome&quot;. Here, anime was the most fun for me. It mixed both action and back-stabbing, with some morally bankrupt characters you love to hate. Everybody here (minus children) is a self-centered jerk and murderer for money or a goal. Like them, Sawa doesn&#039;t worry too much about the lives she destroys along the way. Forgive and forget she will not. I greatly appreciated this grim and unforgiving world of espionage and violence. Here she meets Asahi, a small girl with history mirroring her own but with a heart that could find the strength to forgive. Revenge is too bloody and dark of the path for her to take. The wisest girl here.<br />
<br />
Book 2 &quot;What To Do With My Life Now&quot;. It&#039;s a stark departure from fast-paced book 1, and more focused on Sawa&#039;s transformative journey. Here we can see that Sawa didn&#039;t plan her life past her revenge, showing how revenge burned her from the inside. Only thanks to her bond to Asahi she gets to find her kinder side again, capable of feeling guilty and daring to dream. The side we can connect to. This part was the slowest one, but it needed to happen. Sawa needed to have something to strive for.<br />
<br />
Book 3 “When You Embark On A Journey Of Revenge, Dig Two Graves&quot;. Well, you guessed correctly that anime about revenge couldn’t finish on episode 9. Sawa has more avenging to do but as a kinder version of her prior self. Here, the story comes full circle. Many predictable revelations happen since anime is consistent with its core idea. Revenge is a cycle of never-ending violence and pain. One which follows its path blindly only passes original injustice to younger generations. And what it’s done, always comes back.<br />
<br />
TL; DR With that said, let&#039;s conclude this. This is a decent meditation on nature on revenge, with outcomes in the first row. It&#039;s not too ambitious and it doesn&#039;t overreach. It&#039;s nothing you already didn&#039;t know or heard. It&#039;s cyclical in nature, so you will be able to link dots and ques like a pro. Writing gets its job done, I do not agree it&#039;s too convoluted. Yes, some side characters could afford to have more explored motives, but they are also a bit crazy so...let&#039;s deduce points and move on. <br />
P.S. Sound and animation-wise, this is one of the better anime this spring. OP quickly became one of my seasonal favorites, go listen to it. Animation is great – fluid, artistic, and unique.
