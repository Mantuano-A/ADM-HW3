    Do you like breasts? Of course you do, you wouldn&#039;t be watching anime if you didn&#039;t. Do you like wrestling? Doesn&#039;t matter, have some more breasts.<br />
<br />
Sekai De Ichiban Tsuyoku Naritai (Sekatsuyo for short) is a story about breasts. Sentient breasts with butts attached for panty shots. Two pairs of terrific titties stop by to watch other bodacious boobies bounce around in a wrestling ring. One pair of breasts gets rankled and gives a dropkick to another pair, setting off a string of wacky adventures in the world of foxy wrestling.<br />
<br />
Sakura, the main character, has her personality summed up entirely in the show&#039;s title (spoiler: she

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136209">
        wants to be the strongest in the world). The others have about as much depth as they do cleavage. There&#039;s the mean one, the wise one, the spunky one, the rival, the big shot, and a bunch of others who exist just to fill space (and bras). But who watches fanservice shows for the compelling characters? How about some compelling coconuts, right!? Unfortunately, Sekatsuyo falls short on this as well. There are roughly three kinds of shots throughout the series: close-ups of boobs, close-ups of butts, and close-ups of Sakura twisted up like a pretzel moaning in agony(?). These staple shots are repeated over and over in every episode, sometimes with differently colored boobs and butts, but always with lots and lots of moaning. Seriously, you could just listen to a clip of Sakura shouting “ITAIIII” and skip the first three episodes (which would vastly improve the pacing, more on that later). Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love fanservice, and I love breasts, but I also love a little variety. Couldn&#039;t we have had a wardrobe malfunction, or some shower shenanigans, or drunken skinship, or a hot springs episode, or ANYTHING to break up the “ITAIIII” monotony? The answer is no, we can&#039;t, not until the blu-ray specials at least. Oh well, even if the fanservice is a bit disappointing, at least the action is entertaining, right?<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s take a minute to actually look at the wrestling presented in Sekatsuyo. Don&#039;t worry, we&#039;ll get back to the breasts soon enough. Sekatsuyo can&#039;t seem to decide if its wrestling is fake or real. On one breast, the characters seem take an inhuman amount of punishment in the ring, but there&#039;s never any mention of some supernatural wrestling powers or fighting spirit or any of that. Later on, Sakura compliments another character not on her athletic ability, but for going easy on Sakura to ensure the match is entertaining for the audience. On top of this, the animators went to great lengths to make sure all the moves were performed “safely.” For example, whenever someone takes a piledriver, the piledrivee&#039;s head is always clearly tucked in the other girl&#039;s thighs, safely away from any contact with the ground. Considering how bad the animation can get elsewhere in the show, I&#039;m positive that the moves were intentionally and consistently shown this way as a reminder that these girls aren&#039;t really trying bust each other&#039;s boobies. So it&#039;s all fake, right?<br />
<br />
Not so fast. On the other side of the breast, the characters all seem deathly serious about the various plotlines they get involved in. The show spends an awful lot of time backstage and out of the ring, and not once do we hear any of the characters talk about storylines or planned finishes or any of the “worked” aspects of wrestling. At one point, a masked villainess begins ambushing the other breastlers, and everyone seems genuinely surprised by this unscripted turn of events, even when there&#039;s no audience around or any other reason for them to fake surprise. Even in the ring, things get a bit blurry. Despite the moves being obviously safe, the characters still seem to get injured, and even comment on their own status in their thoughts, and try to think of strategies for legitimately beating their opponents. At one point in a match, Sakura&#039;s leg is nearly broken by an opponent who is hellbent on ending her career, which hampers her wrestling acumen later in the fight (don&#039;t worry though, her breasts are fine). If this was fake, then why would she think privately about how much it hurts and how to work around the injury? If it was real, then why would she risk hurting herself even more doing lots of outlandish flips and throws that wouldn&#039;t work without a willing partner? Sekatsuyo can&#039;t decide, so it just throws lots of boobs at your face and hopes you won&#039;t think too much.<br />
<br />
The worst problem with Sekatsuyo, even more so than the same-y fanservice and the hard-to-follow action, is the first three episodes. As in, the ENTIRETY of the first three episodes. There&#039;s about 10 minutes of set-up for the plot at the beginning, then nothing but Sakura losing over and over and over and over until you start to wonder why you&#039;re wasting your time with this show. Even her fans in-universe give up on the show for the same reason, almost like the producers are saying “it&#039;s fine drop this and watch something else.” It&#039;s hard to describe the unbearable monotone of these episodes; Sakura loses the same way while shouting the same way as her fans shuffle out the same way. Imagine if Haruhi started with Endless Eight, except there&#039;s not even any paranormal explanation. It&#039;s really just the same thing over and over and everyone hates it, real or fictional. The show thankfully improves after this, but it&#039;s a very high hurdle to jump over for new watchers, and the payoff is still not that great.<br />
<br />
If you want to see anime breasts, you can do better than Sekatsuyo. You&#039;re on the internet, after all. If you want to see anime breasts wrestling, well, I&#039;m not sure you really can do better at the moment. Wrestling is a very niche topic in anime (the only other example I can think of is Kinnikuman, which is pretty much the opposite of breasts), and shows like this aren&#039;t likely to inspire a stampede of copycats. You&#039;ll just have to make do with MMA or something in the meantime. Overall, there are worse ways to spend your time than watching Sekatsuyo, and plenty of better ways, but if you want some boobs and don&#039;t want to think, then go for it. You have no one to blame but yourself.

    Ecchi shows these days are a dime a dozen, and when it comes to a studio known for such works as Samurai Girls and Queen&#039;s Blade, people don&#039;t get their hopes high for a tight narrative and endearing characters. Shows very clearly labeled as ecchi and marketed as softcore porn for blu-ray buyers from the outset are practically guaranteed to get negative reviews and low scores across the board for their entire duration.<br />
<br />
Most deserve it. But not all of them do.<br />
<br />
Here we have Wanna Be the Strongest in the World, aka Sekai de Ichiban Tsuyoku Naritai, a show with a title so generic it would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review156573">
        make shounen magazines cry, but with a rather unexpected execution. Yep, that&#039;s right: I&#039;m here to say that this show is actually...kind of good.<br />
<br />
Speaking of shounen magazines and manga, the story of this one fits in rather well with that style. The lead protagonist, Hagiwara Sakura, takes her stubborn attitude to the max when she decides to temporarily leave her idol group behind in order to get back at a pro wrestler for insulting idols and hurting her best friend by going pro herself and vowing to win a match against the one who slighted her group. But the trip isn&#039;t easy; Sakura thought she could just jump in and win a match with a minimal amount of training in the basics, but she got a hard wake up call when Rio tossed her around the ring and bent her in ways that humans probably aren&#039;t meant to bend.<br />
<br />
But no, Sakura did not give up on her goal, and for months she trained and fought for the strength to win this fight. It&#039;s at this point where - if one is paying enough attention - the show actually starts to play with your expectations a little. For the first half of the show, nothing comes easily for Sakura. In fact, the show is extremely tough on her, with her constantly getting beaten down by her opponents and losing match after match until she was nearly ready to give up everything just to spare herself the continued pain of it all. It&#039;s odd to see her shown to actually be naive more than stubborn, not able to take nearly as much punishment as she thinks she can, and the show doesn&#039;t paint her actions in a very positive light when she&#039;s giving up every match and gradually losing all her fans.<br />
<br />
But as they say: the harder the struggle, the greater the triumph. When Sakura finally manages to pull her feet out from under her and hang onto the rope, the eventual results are made that much better because of all the hardship she went through on the way. It may not be the most original story, but it does have an unexpected amount of heart.<br />
<br />
The show changes gears around the halfway point, and things get a little sketchy for a while. A character is introduced that appears to have little purpose other than to be filler and/or make Sakura look a little better. A new opponent is revealed and the show appears to just be rehashing its first half entirely, which had me pretty disappointed, but a surprise twist comes that, when I really thought about it, actually made a whole lot of sense, tied up multiple loose ends with characters whose roles were appearing to be unclear, and justified many of the problems I would have otherwise had with the rest of the show. It was a very natural progression coming off from the first half that leads up to a good climax and rather cheesy, yet not bad conclusion.<br />
<br />
Technically speaking, the show is mostly in that middle range of &quot;you probably won&#039;t notice if you&#039;re only watching for your own entertainment.&quot; The animation budget was clearly saved for the wrestling matches, which are pretty well-done, but the CG audiences show some very rough edges. Sometimes one also has to wonder how big the rings are, because damn, it sure can take these women a long time to run across it. Despite having an idol group as a central focus, the song choice is actually still limited to just the opening and ending themes, which are overall standard fare, neither great nor terrible.<br />
<br />
If one looks at this show as pure fanservice meant to sell blu-rays, they&#039;ll be missing out on something real that, surprisingly, is actually there. The title may be generic as all hell, but it actually defines what the show is about much more than most of the marketing ever did, and fanservice in the show is actually fairly limited. Aside from an extended shower scene in the first episode, nudity scenes are all quick, lasting only a few seconds, and are completely gone past the halfway point of the series. The rest of the fanservice is in the sexy wrestler outfits, camera shots during the fights, and cries of pain, all of which the show never lets up on, and if that kind of thing bothers you, then you should definitely avoid the show at all costs.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m the kind of person who can generally look past a show&#039;s flaws if there&#039;s still something real and good there to see; I can pick out a diamond in the rough, so to speak. I went into this show basically expecting trash, like most people did, but for some reason I seem to be one of a very limited pool who actually found something worthwhile in the show. It gives me the feeling that many viewers don&#039;t even give a show like this a chance, they simply see exposed nipples and apply a stigma to it that means it must be terrible regardless of anything else, because why would a director put such scenes in an otherwise good show? Well, there are any number of reasons, and I for one choose not to dismiss a show just because it uses a few cheap tactics to get viewers when it is otherwise very much worth my time.<br />
<br />
What I found here was a show with a tight narrative, a good cast, and more heart than the majority of shows that are only out there to raise flags.

    Sekai de Ichiban Tsuyoku Naritai (or SekaTsuyo for short) is another inspiring sports show, but cleverly disguised as a trashy ecchi show about girls getting close and personal. This season has seen several of these, like the new season of Hajime no Ippo or Yowamushi Pedal which gives the viewer anime&#039;s take on competitive cycling.<br />
<br />
The story&#039;s focus is largely on the main character, Hagiwara Sakura and the challenges facing her each episode. Most of the time it flows smoothly but the pacing of the actual fights range from okay to poor. The fights don&#039;t offer much in the way of surprises and feel too staged

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125203">
        and forced, especially when the patterns start to repeat and you begin to notice that the fighters seem to take turns beating on each other. The choreography itself is decent, the moves are well done and given a sense of impact, but the submission holds tend to drag out and the cries of pain from the voice actresses become grating and even embarrassing to listen to. The art shares this problem, as the crotch shots, breast shots and the outfits in general aren&#039;t very pleasant to look at - it feels like the artists featured all that just to classify the show as ecchi which is doesn&#039;t exactly feel like.<br />
<br />
The songs used in the opening and ending, as well as the background music is forgettable but not bad. It&#039;s standard with a hint of blandness, just enough to not have anything to say about it. As far as voice acting goes the female ones show a huge amount of skill with their in-fight cries and screams, which sound more painful than erotic (I suspect that was the intended effect.)<br />
<br />
Sakura is much like the generic sports anime protagonist: ambitious and enthusiastic, though she has a few moments that set her apart from the rest. While all of those protagonists face setbacks in one form or another, Sakura&#039;s struggle is painful, brutal and supremely captivating. Viewers watch her struggle and achieve nothing and fall further each time and it&#039;s a reminder that real life isn&#039;t as forgiving as anime. It was a fresh viewing experience, and while it was frustrating and even agonizing to watch her, I&#039;m glad that I did. Her struggle was noble and the fruits of her labor were infinitely sweet.<br />
<br />
Sakura&#039;s struggle is like any other, and that&#039;s fine. Watching her is inspiring, even while seeing her fall you root for her and when she rises you cheer with the crowd. While this isn&#039;t an exceptional anime that should be among to top of this season, it&#039;s good entertainment and one of the few animes about wrestling.<br />
<br />
Is It Yuri?<br />
<br />
With many women comes much speculation. Sadly, there&#039;s not much to go on so I would not recommend it for the yuri factor alone.

    “This is more than just a simple match; this is real drama and real excitement! I dare say it’s the finest form of entertainment in the entire world” – Mariko “Jackal” Toujou, in regards to the final fight in the series.<br />
<br />
Dear Mariko, fuck off. Matter of fact, to everyone that was a part of the creation of this show, fuck off! This kind of shit is the reason why the general public sees anime as either for children or as some kind of sick animated porn, that probably includes tentacles. The latter is mainly due to the use of ecchi within anime shows. For those

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249563">
        of you who don&#039;t know, ecchi is a genre in anime where playfully sexual actions are present within a show. I personally don’t see ecchi as completely bad, as I have seen shows that have successfully integrated fan-service and lewd acts within a story, whilst not coming across as pandering to the audience (e.g. Prison School and Shimoneta). However, the main problem that I find with the ecchi genre overall is that most ecchi anime uses fan-service for exploiting the sex appeal of characters with the primary reason being to please the audience. This show happens to fall so far down the latter that I honestly think that the staff behind the making of this show have no shame whatsoever. And you know what? That’s probably right! So with that said I will have no problem with calling this show out on its absolute bullshit!<br />
<br />
*SPOILERS BELOW BUT I DIDN’T GIVE A FUCK AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU!!!*<br />
<br />
Wanna Be the Strongest in the World is a 2013 anime series based off the manga of the same name and was produced by Studio Arms, the studio that made such disappointing and frowned-upon shows such as Brynhildr in the Darkness and Queen’s Blade. They were also responsible for Elfen Lied, take that as you will. The show lasted for 12 episodes and was centred around teen pop singer and main star of the popular idol group “Sweet Diva” Sakura Hagiwara, who becomes a professional wrestler to avenge her best friend and fellow Sweet Diva member Elena Miyazawa, as well as prove that pop idols can also ‘lay the smackdown’ when it comes to working in the ring. What makes this series so… interesting is that it belongs to the ecchi genre and therefore is obviously going to lean more towards the pervy side of the anime medium, but boy! The fan-service in this show is not just present, it is nearly everything that this show does. I am convinced that the people in charge of this show tried to shove in as much fan-service as they possibly could. Within the first 4 minutes of the very first episode, there is already a shower scene with the two main characters of the show, Sakura and Elena, naked, along with some other Sweet Diva members that don’t matter, who are also naked. You may not know this, but both Sakura and Elena are 17 years old… That may shock you and make you feel a little bit bad about yourself, but Japan obviously doesn’t give a fuck about that!<br />
<br />
What’s even more insulting about this shit show is when it comes to the wrestling side of things. First off, the attire these women wear look more appropriate as swimming gear or what you would wear sliding down a stripper pole rather than wrestling gear. Just look at the cover of the show and you’ll see the kind of outfits that these women wear. Their scantily-clad gear, accentuating the T&amp;A of each wrestler to such a degree cannot be considered realistic, even for pro wrestling standards. Take one quick bump and we could very well have a wardrobe malfunction on our hands. Now I don’t care much about the objectification of women in this show, but there is no other reasonable explanation of why their gear is so skimpy than that the animators were banking on sex appeal to intrigue the audience and not much else. But this issue has nothing on the amount of breast, groin and ass shots repeated over the entire 12 episodes, coupled with moaning. Lots and lots of painful moaning. If you enjoy listening to the screams of curvaceous yet disproportionate women coming from your screen, this show might seem like a gift from God to you. However, after a while I wouldn’t be surprised if you just got bored masturbating to Wanna Be the Strongest and decided to look up some hentai to get off on because I’m sure that there’s hentai you can find that has more variety of animation than this shit. The number of close-ups of breast and camel toes on this show is so damn excessive and unrestrained that you’ll probably start to relate to their parts more than the characters themselves. Even the number of boobs and vagina clips showed in the first episode, where pro wrestler Rio Kazama humiliates both Sakura and Elena can be considered tame compared to what is shown over the next 11 episodes.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest problems this show faces is how it uses the concept of professional wrestling to move the story along. The end of the first episode has Sakura face Rio in a legitimate wrestling match after Rio earlier had beaten down and embarrassed her friend Elena at Berserk gym. Sakura tries to avenge her friends and is beaten in rather quick fashion via passing out to the Rear Naked Choke (a proper submission, but in this show, it’s false advertisement). Sakura got rightfully schooled by the professional and even loses some of her hair as a result, but undeterred she vows to go pro to defend the honour of idols all around the world. She trains her body for three months before taking the ultimate test for rookies: the hellish hundred throws. Basically Sakura takes a total of 100 suplexes from Rio and some other pro wrestlers that don’t even matter, some of which share nearly the same character design as Sakura, the only differences being their hair and wrestling gear. After Rio’s attempts to keep Sakura down along with numerous shots of tits and ass, Sakura survives the challenge, which means that she’s ready to have her first match as a pro. So apparently, they just let you take a hundred bumps and that’s all you need. They didn’t bother to teach her any technique or move-set or even the damn rules before throwing her into a match? We’re two episodes into the shit fest as it’s already a failure of a realistic wrestling drama.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Sakura has the first match as a pro and is beaten by being locked in a submission known as the “Boston crab”. But it’s alright since the fans still love her and happy that she gave it her all in that match, until she loses again, and again, and again, all to the same submission manoeuvre. Obviously she’s always put in the Boston crab because the animators kept wanting to show us her ‘bust &amp; crabs’. Sakura loses several matches in a row, gaining a streak like that of a common jobber and causes fans of her and the show itself to lose interest. Luckily for Sakura, the ace of Berserk gym Misaki Toyoda starts mentoring her and gives her the motivation to break out of the submission of her nightmares, and in her next match she does manage to break out of the hold, before immediately losing via pinfall. Wow, great progression. Meanwhile back at the idol group Sweet Diva, the group has practically become stagnant thanks to their star Sakura becoming a pro wrestler and tapping out to pros that have no development whatsoever. I’m in bewilderment as I’m writing this as to why on Earth did the creator want to make wrestling look realistic? It wants to be a sports drama so badly, yet events in the show and plot points go well beyond the line of ridiculous! If they chose to see pro wrestling as more of a scripted fight than an actual fight, then development wouldn’t have been such a huge issue and they could’ve explored the different lives of idols and pro wrestlers a lot better. But the show doesn’t and would rather take the sport side of it very seriously, with added crotch shots and moaning in between. Fuck this shit.<br />
<br />
Halfway into the show, Sakura gets her rematch with Rio, the woman who humiliated her in the first episode, with no real build-up to it other than what happened in that first episode. That shit isn&#039;t how wrestling works but oh well, nothing in this show works. In the match, Sakura shows a lot more fighting spirit and refuses to give up, and even manages to hit her double-kick finisher to win the match in a huge upset, scoring her first victory. This could have been a strong moment for the series if they had bothered to show Sakura getting progressively stronger and closer to victory in her matches beforehand as well as actual build-up to the match rather than the half-assed execution we got. And another thing, every single match that we have seen from this show or ever will see all cut out the more acrobatic and entertaining parts of actual wrestling matches that are fun to watch, along with any chain wrestling to help wrestling get a feel for how the other wrestler works. All that we see are suplexes, strikes, holds and finishers, but with no reasoning behind them. It’s as if they’re performing moves just for the sake of performing moves. I guess all those submission holds used don’t put much of a strain of the animation budget. Anyway, with Sakura achieving her original goal, she can go back to being a pop star, but she says that she wants to keep proving herself as a wrestler, much to the dismay of her best friend Elena and all of us who’re still watching the shit.<br />
<br />
Nothing else of importance really happens till the final match so we’ll just go there. While Sakura is facing other wrestlers that are literally there to keep Sakura occupied for a couple episodes, a new mysterious masked wrestler named Blue Panther begins taking out other wrestlers until she gets a match with Sakura, demanding that she retire upon losing. It’s at this point where she unmasks and reveals herself to be Elena, Sakura best friend from Sweet Diva. Her plan is to force Sakura into retirement so she can join Sweet Diva again. I don’t know about you guys, but forcing someone to join a group through beating them in a wrestling match does not sound like the healthiest thing for a relationship, and it sounds like something that could come from the WWE storyline, and that’s not a good thing, cause WWE sucks. They have their match and it’s easily the best match from the entire show, actually showing ring psychology within the match. Unfortunately, the main problem with this match is with the animation. Overall the animation of the show is rather inconsistent, but the movement in this match especially is just downright shoddy and makes some of the moves shown looks unintentionally hilarious. Sakura took a damn Tombstone Piledriver (move where the opponent&#039;s head is driven into mat) and a second later her body started to twist and contort out of nowhere. The use of CGI on the crowd was also terrible and the crowd was shown on-screen for way too long, making the poor use of CGI even more obvious. This show also pulls one of the worst things I’ve ever seen in an anime: they have Sakura pinned to a near-fall, but rather than showing Sakura kick out, they turn to a shot of the lights above the ring, and we hear some guy in the crowd say “Wow, that was close”. It’s times like like where I just want to facepalm in frustration with how shit like this is given a pass.<br />
<br />
The match ends with Sakura winning the match. Elena is left heartbroken and pleads her friend to come back to Sweet Diva. The crowd chimes in with their opinion as well, oddly enough, and most say they want to see Sakura back in the idol group, despite cheering her for the last 11 episodes for pursuing her goals of wrestling. Eventually Mariko Toujou comes in and says that both Sakura and Elena can continue wrestling and be pop idols if they can handle it. Who’s Mariko? We’ll get so her soon enough. The show ends with Sakura and Elena all dressed up in their idol gear, performing in front of the wrestling crowd, completely no-selling injuries that they sustained previously in their match. Hoo-ray, the end. Now after all of this I can easily tell you that this was one of the worst stories I have even seen played out in 12 episodes, but that’s not the only horrible thing about this steaming pile of horseshit.<br />
<br />
The characters, oh my God! Despite the amount of characters in this show, not one manages to stand out as even average! Sakura, despite being the most significant character, is also one of the saddest excuses for a main character I’ve ever seen. I’d call her the John Cena of the show, but at least John Cena has a personality. Throughout the entire show she struggles in every match, either winning by the skin of her teeth, or being dominated throughout the match. She wants to become the strongest and prove herself, but never once changes or has her morals challenged. They could have if say, they had her reflect on her losses, but they never even try that because the staff are too busy prioritising crotch-shots over character development.<br />
<br />
Elena is next up on the platform of shame. This girl is both Sakura’s best friend and rival, always coming close to beating Sakura, but never beating her in anything. She is obviously jealous of Sakura’s accomplishments, bra size and overall success. Unfortunately she always maintains her place throughout the show, ending up one-dimensional. One thing I want to know though, how the fuck is this girl able to challenge and almost beat Sakura despite having barely any proper training over the duration of the show, compared to Sakura, who needed to train her boy up for 3 months before even getting a match? <br />
<br />
Rio Kazama-You know what? Fuck this bitch. She doesn’t matter at all to the overall story. She’s just a bitchy wrestler with a cocky attitude and no ass. NO ASS! Alright next character is Moe. Moe is a high school freshman who’s the granddaughter of a former wrestler and who was inspired to start wrestling through watching Sakura. This girl is only important for one episode where she faces Sakura purely to keep the show going. She’s easily replaceable and her only memorable act in the entire show was motorboating the main character.<br />
<br />
And then, there was Mariko “Jackal” Toujou. This woman happens to be the world champion, and yet, she doesn’t matter at all when it comes to the story. She faces Sakura in the second half of the show because her original opponent was injured, but if you had replaced this woman with some random wrestler, the show wouldn’t have changed at all. She’s just another pair of tits to get off to when you get bored of Sakura. But if there is one thing that I hate about her, more than any other character on the fucking show, it’s that quote that I put at the start of the review. She called the match between Sakura and Elena the finest form of entertainment in the whole world. She just shitted on the entire world of professional wrestling this that one sentence. I know that it shouldn’t be taken seriously but fuck it: Fuck off Mariko! You wish you had as much depth as your cleavage does! Fuck you and this show, bitch!<br />
<br />
Earlier on I talked about how shit the animation was whilst explain the “plot” (and I use that term lightly here) of this shit show. But it needs to be said again: THIS SHOW LOOKS LIKE SHIT! The art style is generic as all hell, with nearly every character having a similar design and no cup size below C (if we exclude the high school girl, no cup size below D). This show also has only two proper locations; the gym and the wrestling ring. This show is so devoid of artistic freedom that even at 12 episodes I’m surprised at how long it went for. Character movement is just garbage, and when they aren’t showing proper movement, they’re showing close-ups, screen shots, and reused footage, and it is painful to watch. The fan-service. Is fucking painful. To everyone who likes shows like this because of the ecchi elements in place, if you removed the close-ups of female anatomy from this show it would be very bland. That’s what this show was, even with the fan-service, because it fails at using ecchi well at all. In fact, with the kind of shots that were used repeatedly within the show, it’s more disturbing than erotic at all. Seeing Sakura’s vagina whilst during a submission for the umptieth time is not only tiring, it’s just sad.  <br />
<br />
If there was anything that I would say was positive from this show, it would have to be the opening and ending themes. Not the overall OP and ED; those shit videos were piss breaks. But the themes on their own fits with the idol part of the show, and were at least decent to listen to. I wouldn’t say that I didn’t skip them every time, but they didn’t further hinder the show. Overall the soundtrack was a dud, with no song standing out except for one that sounded like a rip-off of the battle theme from the original Pokemon games. In my opinion, no song meshed well with any of the scenes in the show. Voice-acting wise, well what can I say? Half the time the characters were just moaning and screaming; it was just annoying. I guess I’d say the voice of Sakura did the best, since she screamed more than anyone else, but then again I screamed just as much from just watching this piece of trash anime.<br />
<br />
This show is literally one of the worst anime that I have ever layed my eyes on. It tries to make professional wrestling look like a noble and rigorous sport, whilst cutting to a muff shot every 10 seconds. It puts pandering shit fests like Queen’s Blade and Sekirei to shame. The makers of this disturbing fan-service filled and generic as fuck “you-can-do-it” crapfest should have changed the name from Wanna Be the Strongest in the World, to Wanna Be the Worst in the World, because this show is deserving of a title like that. The entire existence of the show was an elaborate scheme made to animate bouncing boobies and bulging coochies whilst under the extremely thinly-veiled disguise of telling a story, and an awful one at that. The plot was pure garbage. Calling the cast of this show characters would be giving them too much credit. This is a failure in every possible sense of the word. If you want a proper sports drama, check out something like Hajime no Ippo. If you want proper use of ecchi in a story, I’d recommend Prison School. If you just want to see scantily-clad animated women play with each other, even Keijo and some hentai shows would be better than this pile of garbage.<br />

    This is an ecchi show. You are forewarned if you don&#039;t like to see boobs bouncing. Proceed at your own risk.<br />
<br />
Now, if ecchi doesn&#039;t bother you, and you like stories with character developments, you might just find this story a surprise sleeper waiting to be discovered.<br />
<br />
The premise of the story actually has a lot more in common with titles like Slam Dunk, Haikyuu, etc (it is about sports after all) than with what we generally think of as ecchi. Sakura, our protagonist, decides to join pro wrestling on a whim after her profession - idol - and friend were abused/ridiculed by a pro wrestler. <br />
<br />
As

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186701">
        fake as pro wrestling may seem, it takes incredible talent and hard work to perform, and our protagonists was quickly abused of her naive notions. Her perseverance to take on the obstacles is the journey this story undertakes.<br />
<br />
If the chosen sports isn&#039;t female pro wrestling, this title probably will barely be associated with ecchi at all. There are no generic harem MC&#039;s around, nor are there any boob grabs etc. The &quot;ecchi-ness&quot; basically comes from the attires and the awkward positions wrestlings tend to cause wrestlers to be in, and yes, boobs will bounce around when the body is slammed upside down. The same can be found in gymnastics and figure skating, which I guess some people can also see them as ecchi. People will see what they want to see.<br />
<br />
And I see a young woman who was willing to take on the challenge of becoming a pro wrestler, going through the hardships and challenges, and find herself alone the way. <br />
<br />
This by no means is a sports master piece as Slam Dunk, nor does it fully avoid &quot;fan service&quot; shots, and the amount of difficulty encountered in the beginning can be disheartening for viewers to continue (ITAI!). But overall the story is a fun ride. It will transport you to the ring side and make you feel the pain and joy of the characters. It&#039;s worth a try.<br />

    ITAI! ITAI! ITAI!!!!!! Ok, enough of Sakura&#039;s &quot;ITAI&quot; monologue. So, leave it to them Japanese when they wanna come out something usual and exaggerate it..in be it in Manga or Anime....Ok so I haven&#039;t read the manga, and I probably won&#039;t...except skim over the fanservice. Co&#039;z frankly that what I&#039;ve been doing since this anime was shown. Frankly, this anime can be compared to one of those mix wrestling porn videos, where it involves FBB&#039;s doing some choreographed wrestling and choking of the guys, also this anime is somewhat of a crush video as well since we do see the main character Sakura getting crush

          <span style="display: none;" id="review139471">
        a lot and that is basically what this anime is. Tbh, watching WWE Divas is more exciting than this crush anime, however I can&#039;t deny that this anime has a musical element in it since it features the ending song &quot;Fan Fanfare.&quot; Also, the exaggeration about the life of a female wrestlers has too many things that were fancy, like getting slammed on the floor ring 100 times.....geeez, even our local  female wrestlers don&#039;t get subjected into that kind of punishment, even though they undergo such strict training regiment, even a WWE Diva never go to that kind of extreme either, sure they do get slammed but they train their bodies first and practice a controlled fall before they get into the ring, beside no fan would wanna see their fave diva get checked in a hospital very often. If there is anything int resting about this anime that would the most obvious thing and you guy&#039;s minus well give yourself a pat on your shoulders since in was all about the fanservice and the characters getting punished that was the most exciting part, who cares about the melodrama and those blah,blah,blah and blah? So here were my ratings for this anime:<br />
<br />
<br />
Story- Pathetic 1.<br />
<br />
Co&#039;z the story doesn&#039;t matter at all and the plot was just like watch something from WWE.<br />
<br />
Art- Outstanding 10. <br />
<br />
I need not mention, about them voluptuous bitches in their hot leotard, also one just have to wait probably after 6 months co&#039;z there might be some anime link out there who would be showing uncensored bathroom and changing room scenes........ where we get to see Sakura&#039;s boobs. Btw, as I&#039;ve edited this review this anime&#039;s (uncensored) special has already been aired. <br />
<br />
Sound- Good 7. <br />
<br />
I like seiyu&#039;s who did Sakura and Elena&#039;s voices, I also like the closing song, but not the op.<br />
<br />
Character- Pathetic 1<br />
<br />
In this segment, I probably won&#039;t give a fuck about it, except that Sakura and Elena were just a bunch of bimbos who wanna raise their popularity and end up in trouble, in fact all of the character&#039;s here are not something give a fuss about and instead it&#039;s what they do that has to be given a look.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- Outstanding 10. <br />
<br />
I need not mention why, since I may end up just repeating what I&#039;ve said about the fanservice and the crushing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall- Pathetic 1. <br />
<br />
If one is looking for some value and lesson in this anime then this isn&#039;t the thing to watch, also I hated how this anime ended when Sakura and Elena were made to choose whether to be a pro-wrestler or be an Idol and what studio Earth Star Entertainment did was do a play safe thing where the 2 bimbos get to have the two sides of the coin, and as they say in the south.........of the USA, &quot;If you try to catch two prey, you&#039;ll end up not catching any of them.&quot; It was the same thing with this anime, where getting them divas be idols and wrestlers in the end has made this anime Pathetic, and they might wanna &quot;GIVE UP&quot; on a possible season 2. <br />
<br />
<br />
PS: This is an edited review, co&#039;z them mods dislike the troll that I&#039;ve placed from my previous review, ITAI!!!!<br />

    (This has been adapted from my reddit thread)<br />
<br />
Every medium has its highs and its lows. That is, most things contain good, bad, and everything in between. This can be applied to things such as, say, pop-star idols and wrestling. But what happens when you combine the worst of both of those worlds? What you get is an astonishing piece of work. Wanna Be The Worst Anime In -- oh, sorry. Wanna Be The Strongest In The World! is this combination, and it is the worst piece of entertainment my eyes have ever witnessed.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Strongest stars Sakura, a &quot;Sweet Diva&quot; idol who joins the pro wrestling scene

          <span style="display: none;" id="review167361">
        in order to protect and avenge the honor of her fellow dancers and singers.<br />
<br />
Tagged as &quot;ecchi,&quot; it should come as no surprise that the show focuses quite a bit on the fan-service. The show depicts the women in scantily-clad clothing, which allows for plenty of breast, groin, and ass shots. But the issue isn&#039;t the fan-service itself (I personally never have a problem with it) but the way in which it is done. The attempts at it are honestly rather weak and extremely repetitive; &quot;seeing&quot; Sakura&#039;s vagina during an upside-down hold or seeing the Berserk girls getting re-dressed for the hundredth time is not only tiring but completely unimaginative.<br />
<br />
And this is something that plagues the entire show, not just the fan-service. It is repetition incarnate. Almost everything that happens within the first three episodes is seen, in some way, shape, or form, throughout the entirety of the series, right up until the end. The same moves, the same screaming, the same fights; nothing interesting or inspiring ever issues forth from the show, despite its attempts at hard determination and willful endurance.<br />
<br />
Examining it even more closely, one could try to argue that the show is about what it means to never give up despite adversity. But the problem here is that the show never leaves the adversity behind. For Sakura, absolutely everything is always a struggle. Whether it is her trying to win her first match or her going up against the newest rookie, she is constantly having the most difficult time getting through her current predicament. At some point, I would have loved to have seen her actually make some progress. Yes, she wins here and there. However, her never-ending uphill battle is just plain annoying, just plain repetitive.<br />
<br />
On top of all this, the show usually introduces plot points or new narrative pieces, uses them for a bit, and then ignores them afterwards. Or, better yet, some of them appear completely out of nowhere and with zero context. In short, the story is a mash-up of laziness, repetition, and discontinuity that should never have been approved.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
It&#039;s almost unfair to call Strongest an anime.<br />
<br />
The art style for the show is very generic. The main characters look perfect and plain, while the more exotic characters are usually the villains or the &quot;bosses&quot; that need to be conquered later. On top of this, the show features about two locations: the Berserk training building and the main wrestling ring, the former of which contains a ring as well, so two may be a bit of a stretch. This means that there is no room for artistic creativity or freedom, and much of what one sees is very lackluster.<br />
<br />
Speaking of lackluster, the actual animation is probably the worst I have seen to date. Being not only an idol show but also a wrestling show, one would expect to see some movement from the characters. Sadly, this is not the case. Instead, the show loves to do extreme close-ups, still shots, and re-used scenes. It seemed that corners were being cut at every turn, and it is painful to watch at times. In particular, the &quot;Ice Cream Somersault&quot; is so corny and terribly animated that it made me wince every time it was used.<br />
<br />
Strongest also earns the honor of having the worst use of CGI I have seen from any anime ever. The crowd is done &quot;Madden NFL Style&quot; where certain sprites are used multiple times to give the illusion that the crowd is different. But the problem was that they would have the crowd on-screen too long, so the similarities in clapping hands and bodies became obvious. There are also terrible technical issues that can be spotted, most dominate of which can be found near the end of the show&#039;s last episode.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
Despite having a large cast, almost all of the characters fail to have any meaning or attachment attributed to them. For the sake of this review, I will talk about three different characters to hopefully get my point across.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with Elena. Elena is a proud, emotional, and determined woman who shines best with a mic in her hand and lights in her face. She cares about Sakura and her friends, always wanting to improve herself to seem worthy in their eyes. She maintains this position during the show, never really wavering from it, making her quite one-dimensional in nature, if that.<br />
<br />
Moe, a high school girl, is easily infatuated, technical, and peppy. Her love for the sport comes from her love of Sakura, and her ability to focus and prove her worth is definitely an asset. So what&#039;s the issue? She is a character that was introduced in episode nine. Being one-cour, spending an episode and a half on a brand new character who is then tossed to the side to make way for the conclusion makes zero sense. She doesn&#039;t even offer anything to the other characters besides making some of them slightly annoyed by her behavior. She literally could have been removed from the show and nothing would have changed otherwise.<br />
<br />
The most significant character, if she can be called that, is Sakura. Being strong is her one and only trait. And yet, everyone puts her on this high pedestal, claiming her to be the next greatest thing. But this side of her is never seen. Again, this is attributed to her constant struggling; she never, not once, has a &quot;battle.&quot; Everything that happens either ends in her complete domination or she barely wins by the skin of her teeth. As a viewer, you don&#039;t feel sad when she loses or happy when she wins, you really just want her to stop wrestling since it just never seems to be working out.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast are more or less the same as these three; again, repetition is the shows most prominent flaw. The divas, the other wrestlers, the best pros: each has just one facet that comprises them, and that&#039;s it. No one, not even Sakura, sees any sort of growth or development beyond what is shown in the first episode, and that is astounding.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The OP had potential, since the opening and ending to it sounded somewhat unique, but then it devolves into generic beats and singing that rivals the show itself in terms of quality.<br />
<br />
The ED is perhaps the best part of the show, which is probably saying something. It&#039;s an idol song, so it definitely fits the show nicely. It&#039;s not super catchy, but it at least has some semblance of effort put into it.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is terrible. It contains varying pieces of piano, guitar, and other sounds that I can&#039;t even name.<br />
<br />
Voice acting wise, I think I at least have to give a nod to Ayana Taketatsu for her role as Sakura. Since Sakura cried in pain for three quarters of the show, it must have been tough to use her voice in such a way for so long.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
As an exercise for myself, I&#039;ll give the people who read this the four words that are used as dialogue for the entire anime, highest to lowest rate of use: &quot;Oww!&quot;, &quot;Give up?&quot;, &quot;No!&quot;, and &quot;Sakura!&quot; You will hear these four words during the show and when you sleep at night, because this is the extent of what is said. It&#039;s simply another example of the repetition that the show is mired in.<br />
<br />
This one is never funny, dramatic, emotional, tense, rewarding, inspiring, cute, interesting, or any other positive adjective you can apply to an object. It&#039;s just &quot;there&quot; and never moves from that spot. It tries to do these things, it tries to break free from its excessive boredom, but it just can&#039;t due to its abysmal story and characters.<br />
<br />
During my time watching anime, I&#039;ve said to myself, &quot;I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible to have an undeniably atrocious show. I don&#039;t see myself ever giving an anime the lowest possible score.&quot; But guess what, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World? Congratulations.<br />
<br />

    Everything about this was terrible. The story could have had a chance, but it didn&#039;t.<br />
The art/artstyle is plain and boring All of the characters look the same, same bodies, same faces, given obvious changes like hair, or eye colour.<br />
The sound was mediocre at best, the voice acting was dreadful. I was asking myself why I didn&#039;t drop it after episode 3. Episode 4 felt like driving a screwdriver through my ears and into my skull. If I wanted to listen to painful moans I&#039;d watch some terrible porn, which would still be better than this. In acting, story, characters, and enjoyment.<br />
Overall, it&#039;s a dreadful watch

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125131">
        with nothing going for it, except large tits and fanservice. Which can be fine and all, but that&#039;s all this tries to have going for it, which doesn&#039;t cut it. 2/10, the soundtrack was generic enough to keep it from being a 1/10.

    The synopsis of this anime involves an Idol who  wants to start pro wrestling due to an insult from a professional wrestler. The idol accepts the challenge and is brutally defeated, only then swearing to defeat this fighter by becoming a professional wrestler. <br />
<br />
This Idol then takes on the rigorous training for several months and finally makes her debut fight which either wins or loses im not sure, but then proceeds to lose over 50 consecutive fights by the same exact hold.  The boston crab which gives us plenty of fanservice and moaning for several episodes. <br />
<br />
Considering you are a professional wrestler you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review159597">
        can probably only take 2 matches a week or even 3 at the max. Losing those matches over and over again makes me wonder what the fuck was our Main Character doing for half a year.  Losing to the same hold every single time.<br />
<br />
Soon after she deals with the first person she fought who was indeed stronger than the 50 other people she loses to. She defeats this person and is soon challenged by the best wrestler in the world. Why? Who the fuck knows, the series stops before we get to see any real reason as to why the worlds best wrestler would want to fight somebody with a 1-50 winning record. <br />
<br />
This is easily the worst piece of animation I have ever laid my eyes on. Story was garbage, the sound consisted of the Main Character either moaning or complaining. The characters were garbage, I couldn&#039;t have enjoyed this show if I was paid millions of dollars. This was the worst anime i&#039;ve ever seen. <br />
<br />
Worse than Pupa and Mars of Destruction.

    Not bad,not bad at all.<br />
<br />
Wanna be the Strongest in the World! or Sekai de Ichiban Tsuyoku Naritai! is a Japanese manga by ESE and Kiyohito Natsuki. The story follows Sakura Hagiwara, a pop idol and member of an idol group known as Sweet Diva that impulsively decides to turn into a pro-wrestler in order to avenge another fellow Sweet Diva member who got a beating from a female wrestler.<br />
<br />
For an anime with a shallow and exploitable premise it does a respectable job with it&#039;s storytelling. An idol becoming a female wrestler seems like a project that can be incompetently executed or just vulgar fanservice bait

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125931">
        but it turns out rather well. In the span of 12 episodes this series is straightfoward, evenly paced and reaches a nice conclusion. It has all the fundamentals you&#039;d find in any other good sports story. A heavy focus on how hard work and perseverance are needed for a person to succeed. One thing I appreciate about the anime is that pro-wrestling never comes easy to the main character. Sakura suffers humiliating losses and has to take immense bumps over the course of the series before she&#039;s able to accomplish much of anything.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s what makes her endearing. Watching Sakura try her hardest against the odds provides us with an easy character to connect to or at least cheer for. She&#039;s a sweet, determined, strong and an all-around good heroine. Which is crucial because she gets most of the series attention. Other than Sakura, the most prominent character in the series is Elena. Sakura&#039;s rival who is beaten by a female wrestler. Sakura leaving Sweet Diva leave an impression on her character and thus, are the motivation for Elena&#039;s actions. The anime does what it can with the rest of it&#039;s leaving at least a few more memorable characters that are essential to the plot. <br />
<br />
The art and animation is good for the most part. The colors are nice and the character designs are very distinctive and attractive. The lighting in the wrestling ring is also noteworthy as it adds something to the matches. Now when it comes to the animation the production values aren&#039;t very high so the scenes focus on the anime&#039;s selling point: Fanservice. There are plenty of breast and crotch shots during submission holds such as the Boston Crab or the Camel Clutch. Another problem is that some scene are repeated and not animated much at all and it&#039;s very noticeable. Too its credit however, the scenes that are animated well make for some really entertaining action sequences. The anime also does a great job in showing off technical the moves are. You can see exactly what one character is doing the other and which body parts are being inflicted with damage.<br />
<br />
The sound aspect isn&#039;t anything special. The BGM has only a few noteworthy tracks and the opening and ending themes are average at best. The voice acting doesnt have any standout performance but the moans and screams of pain (most notably Sakura&#039;s) sound very similar to what one would hear in a hentai.<br />
<br />
Despite all that this is a very enjoyable program. It&#039;s a casual anime that doesn&#039;t require much of anything from the viewer or the budget it was made on. Sekai de Ichiban Tsuyoku Naritai! deliver to its target audience just as it should. Overall 7/10 Nothing more, nothing less.

    The first thing I would like to say is that while one of this show&#039;s genres is ecchi, it has much more than just that to offer. Don&#039;t get me wrong- this show delivers on the ecchi and there is plenty of it to enjoy. That being said I feel this show stands out as a masterpiece even if you don&#039;t like ecchi. Let me explain why I feel that way...<br />
Story: 10<br />
This show at its core is a story about passionate people who fight through pain and hardships to do what they love. This is a story of overcoming all the odds and chasing dreams.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230935">
        Pro wrestlers in real life experience many hardships and the story pulls no punches on those realities. You get to see their struggles in and outside the ring and the story makes you really feel for the cast. This makes the matches extremely exciting beyond a technical standpoint. The viewer knows what the characters are feeling and what is at stake with each match-up. I think this type of story can resonate with many people and that is why the story of this show is so great.<br />
Story Themes Include: fighting spirit, sportsmanship, honor, grit, the true nature of Professional Wrestling, rivalry, and friendship (and how rivalry and friendship are not mutually exclusive things).  <br />
Art: 10 <br />
The colorful art fits the exciting tone of the show and makes everything pop. It really brings the show to life. The character designs really shine. Each character is very distinct looking and the designs of the wrestling gear and outfits look amazing! The technicalities of the wrestling moves are drawn with great detail and accuracy. The wrestling venues are also drawn with great care. I feel they put a ton of love into the art of this show. <br />
Sound: 10 <br />
The music always adds to the intensity, excitement, and drama of the matches. Music pieces that play outside the ring also always build the mood and emotion of the scenes. Opening really pumps you up and the ending song has a great deal of meaning in the context of the story. The voice actors deliver their lines with heart and purpose. The sound effects are one of the best aspects of this show&#039;s sound quality. It is just so visceral. It is like you can feel the impact of each hit or slam. When submission moves are locked in the sound effects convey the agony of being twisted into awful positions. <br />
Characters: 10 <br />
I loved every character in this show. Each one has so much heart. The various members of the cast all have their own motivations. Their actions are driven by varying things, but you can always understand and sympathize with them. The viewer can get where they are coming from. Character interactions are full of meaning and purpose. This gets you really invested into character bonds. This show takes character development seriously and this makes the cast feel very real to the viewer. <br />
Enjoyment: 10 <br />
I loved this show! As a big fan of Pro Wrestling I really felt it captured the true nature of Pro Wrestling, and the heart and spirit of its athletes. If you love Pro Wrestling you simple can not miss this show! That being said I feel you do not need to be a wrestling fan to love it. This will also delight fans of action, ecchi, sports, and drama. I feel it has very broad appeal. I am sure to re-watch this show in the future. I will never forget this show.   <br />

    What exactly do I think about Sekai de Ichiban Tsuyoku Naritai?<br />
<br />
Well, to be frank, I was going to drop the series after just watching the 1st episode. It was nothing special and the only thing that stood out was the sexy girls with all the fan servicing. That was the only reason I continued onto the series to see their stuff bouncing while they were fighting. <br />
<br />
I really started to hate the protagonist with all his giving up. It is very rare where you see the protagonist giving up all the time in an anime. <br />
<br />
That sucked a lot but the fan service...wow!!! Until episode

          <span style="display: none;" id="review143101">
        5, the series would be rated between 5 and 6 by me. But guess what? Episode 6 changed that. This fight was awesome and now I see some potential and the fan service is already there to double it up. <br />
<br />
We have seen many anime which are really good and they could carry the story really well with having the fan servicing a part of them like High School DXD, to love ru (I don&#039;t mean to compare just saying), Sekai de Ichiban may not be able to reach these heights, but I guess it&#039;s worth a watch.

    OK, you might think that this show is all about oppais, well, you are wrong, cause, it is all about panty shots... The camera, the art direction, is all about to take the best panty shot on the screen, it have breasts? Yep, but, it almost doesn&#039;t count, cause there&#039;s some minors breast shots on the bathroom...<br />
Ok, now you ask, why the heck am i speaking only about the fanservice... Cause there&#039;s no story, a atletic idol wanna be the best wrestler in the world.. oO omg... That&#039;s so bad, as bad as some twists in the story, but, the characters at least they are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231803">
        all charismatic, if you get past the story, stupid character decisions,  lame fanservice, you have a shot on enjoying this show.<br />
<br />
But, we have some good things about it too, the main character is driven, a very strong female, as the fighters. <br />
<br />
To end it... did i liked it? Nope, <br />
Did i enjoyed? Nope<br />
Do i want to see more? Absolutely Nope.<br />
I&#039;m glad that it ended, and i&#039;m not craving for more...

    I have mixed feeling about this anime. It was both hilariously bad, but also very endearing and exciting. <br />
<br />
Story 9/10<br />
<br />
First, let me just point the good parts about this anime&#039;s story. <br />
<br />
Despite being super ecchi, this anime is a good underdog story and sports anime, in general. Especially in the final episode, I found myself really cheering for Sakura and shouting &quot;you can do it&quot; at my screen. Also, I&#039;m not a fan of pro-wrestling in real life, but it does seem like the creators did some research into the sport and the fights are well choreographed with moves like the Boston crab hold, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306610">
        spider hold, and the flying moon press. <br />
<br />
Now, let me point out the reasons why I found this anime hilariously stupid. <br />
<br />
So the premise is Sakura is a member of an idol group called Sweet Diva, but after her best friend gets beat up by a pro-wrestler named Rio who calls all idols dumb bimbos Sakura quits Sweet Diva to become a pro-wrestler to beat Rio and defend the pride of idols everywhere. <br />
<br />
How big is Sakura&#039;s ego? Seriously, this completely random stranger insults her and Sakura&#039;s response is to undergo an entire career change, abandon the other members of her idol group, and become pro-wrestler. Sakura even admits later that her reason for becoming a pro-wrestler was stupid and petty, but admitting what you did was stupid doesn&#039;t negate the stupidity of your actions!<br />
<br />
Also, I love how supportive Sakura&#039;s manager is throughout the anime. Seriously, woman, your job is to manage Sakura&#039;s career, in what universe is going from being an idol to a wrestler a good career move?!<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t spoil the ending, but I will say it had me on the floor laughing from how stupid it was! LOL XD<br />
<br />
Characters 8/10<br />
<br />
Sakura is a great character. Her motivation for becoming a wrestler may have been nonsensical, but, God bless her, she does work hard which makes it incredibly satisfying to see her win. <br />
<br />
Rio and Blue Panther are two of Sakura&#039;s rivals and I liked how they both represented this barrier Sakura had to get over. It was made even harder by Rio and Blue Panther never showing Sakura any mercy and constantly calling her a pop princess. <br />
<br />
Moe is Sakura&#039;s apprentice who appears later in the show. Every time I hear her name I laugh. Seriously, isn&#039;t this like having a character named Tsundere or Otaku?<br />
<br />
The League of Evil are a team of wrestlers who, as their name implies, cheat and do whatever it takes to win. I was disappointed these characters didn&#039;t appear more because I thought they were really cool. <br />
<br />
Art 9/10<br />
<br />
Of course, this is an ecchi anime so get ready for lots of boobs, butts, and crotch shots. Lots and lots of crotch shots; sometimes two crotches at once. <br />
<br />
Also, something I have to tip my hat to this anime for is you know that trope where a girl is taking a shower and the steam covers her nipples? Well, gentlemen, finally we have an anime not afraid to show 100% uncensored boobs. I can confirm that there is actually a scene where there are no less than four pairs of boobs on screen at the same time! It was so beautiful that it brought a tear to my eye :&#039;)<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
<br />
I just wanted to comment how these voice actors should seriously think about getting jobs in hentai because the girl characters do so much screaming! <br />
<br />
Overall 9/10<br />
<br />
I loved You Wanna Be the Strongest in the World from beginning to end. It started off being hilariously bad with an incredibly stupid story, but, while the story was still very nonsensical, as I kept watching it did turn into a really good underdog story. <br />
<br />
The only reason I didn&#039;t give it a 10/10 was because I usually save that rating for anime that I have zero complaints with.

    Watch Hajime no Ippo instead. You&#039;ll like it better. It has more unique character designs, good jokes, flawless execution of a character with a lot of heart and drive, which Wanna be the Strongest doesn&#039;t. Main character girl Sakura (real original there) gives up a bunch in episodes 2, 3, and 4. There are a lot of shrieks of pain that get upper uncomfortable to listen to, no matter how alone you are, and unnecessary idol friends. Don&#039;t watch it. The performances in the original Japanese dub are ear gratingly annoying too. Don&#039;t watch it, but if you do, the English dub is surprisingly more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222135">
        tolerable. <br />
<br />
OKAY MUSIC. I do recommend the sound track if you aren&#039;t a fan of idol fodder, but would like to have a good understanding of what it sounds like.

    It&#039;s bad.<br />
Let&#039;s keep things simple, other people have already left thesis length reviews if you want something that in depth.<br />
<br />
Should you watch this anime? Probably not. Only under some very niche circumstances would I recommend it.<br />
<br />
Are you looking for a sports anime with cute girls? There are way better options out there with better storytelling and pacing. Are you looking for an ecchi anime? Let&#039;s be honest, with a cover and tags/rating like that 99% of you reading this will be. There are TONS of better ecchi anime out there. The pacing and storytelling in this series is absolutely mediocre. Yes it has boobs and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421552">
        butts galore, and two or three incredibly brief nip shots, but it&#039;s just not worth having to watch through this for that.<br />
<br />
So what&#039;s my main issue with this series? As you may have guessed from above, it&#039;s the horrible pacing. Nothing actually interesting happens the entire series. The main heroine gets wrecked each match for 90% of the duration only to make a comeback in the last 10%. She is shown to grow during matches or to have epiphanies during training, only to get wrecked like always once she gets in the ring. She fights a few matches that get hyped up, struggles with her idol attachments, and just fails to be exciting for the viewer.  That&#039;s it, that&#039;s literally the entire series.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s just better alternatives out there for whatever reason you might be wanting to watch this. The only exception here, the only people I would recommend this to would be... If you get off from endlessly hearing nonstop high pitched squeals of pain and mediocrity. You will hear her screaming and squealing NONSTOP. If this is your thing then this is the perfect anime for you!
