    The Promised Neverland 2nd Season is a brilliant achievement of Japanese Television. It is a series that has no reason to exist other than to profit off of unsuspecting fans of the first season. This is the spiritual successor to Tokyo Ghoul: Root A—another anime original sequel that attempted to inflict as much severe pain and suffering on the manga fans as possible. Except, at least that blatant marketing scheme had semi-decent audiovisuals. <br />
<br />
This sequel follows Female Kirito, previously known as “Emma”. Similar to Kirito, Emma is also the most powerful player in the video game. Rather than using a sword, she has the power

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386639">
        of plot armor to protect her from any danger! Getting chased by a demon? She can outrun it. Armed soldiers can’t kill demons with guns? She’ll kill it with a bow &amp; arrow. Instead of getting followed around by a harem, Female Kirito has a bunch of children that go along with anything she says. They have names but don’t worry—you won’t remember them anyway. Previously a character known as “Ray” challenged Emma’s overly idealistic goals. This season he has been renamed to “Hay” because has no weight on the plot and allows Emma to do anything—no matter how stupid she acts. A long-lost friend (who was lost for less than 6 episodes) returns, but he’s actually a bitter Bad Guy now! Shocking! But why is he bad? He explains everything to us because we are incapable of comprehending storytelling—we must be fucking idiots! <br />
<br />
Just sit back and get spoonfed by one of Season Two’s many iconic exposition scenes: Emma and her harem gather in a non-descript room, and one character stands-up and summarizes 100 chapters of the manga in a five to ten-minute long speech. It’s like karaoke night, but instead of singing, they monotonously read SparkNotes summaries of the manga with no animation whatsoever. Unless you consider a PowerPoint presentation to be animation. The Promised Neverland 2nd Season does not tell a story, nor does it do much of anything. It uses a bunch of unrelated plot points throughout dozens of chapters. Years of time skips pass by in minutes. Then it stitches these barely connected pieces together like a hideous quilt. <br />
<br />
The entire show rides on how Emma’s feeling today. In one episode she’ll let the kids eat potentially poisonous fish, in the other she’ll happily help a demon with its groceries despite knowing they like to eat children for supper. No matter anything she does, she’ll have either a smile on her face or a slightly concerned expression. I don’t like comparing the adaptation to the manga, but in this case, it is impossible to not notice the differences in art detail and writing quality. All of the passion is drained, turning climactic moments into laughably bad dialogue. Villains double-cross each other in unison like a hive mind being controlled by an annoyed writer. <br />
<br />
They should have explained the motivations behind everyone’s sudden changes in goals and morality, but that’d require hard work. And lazy writers don&#039;t like doing hard work. Why bother adapting three beloved story arcs from the manga—full of battles that would be VERY expensive to animate—when you can just summarize them with a PowerPoint presentation? That&#039;s easy money! Strip away the psychological horror, intelligence, atmosphere, and logic that made the original anime so special, and what do you have left? This piece of inane shit. Granted, I am not a huge fan of the original, but it was light-years better than this. The show is dependent upon the demon creature effects but, even in 2D, they are below average at best. It’s remarkable, really. CloverWorks has mastered the art of being lazy, and they should be applauded for that.<br />
<br />
My instinct is to blame the writers at Cloverworks, but it’s clear from disappearing names in the credits that they did not want to be associated with this colossal dumpster fire. According to interviews, the mangaka co-wrote the anime original story, but that has never stopped a film from being bad. George Lucas co-wrote The Rise of the Skywalker, and George R.R. Martin worked on the clusterfuck that was Game of Thrones S8. Just like those adaptations, The Promised Neverland will go down as one of the greatest declines in writing quality in all of anime history. The last time I saw an anime crash and burn so hard in the final act was Darling in the FranXX. <br />
<br />
That’s all there is to The Promised Neverland 2nd season. Finishing as quickly as possible to cash a paycheck. Every aspect of it is rushed: The stiff voice performances, the recycled soundtrack is poorly mixed. They reuse the same facial expressions, character animations, background art, and CGI monsters. Even to the untrained eye, it will be obvious the production has cut corners in literally every aspect. If you don’t care about quality and want your intelligence to be insulted, watch this remarkable landmark in anime history. Come along, join these personified potatoes on a journey to rebel against Weekly Shounen Jump by becoming the most profitable adaptation while putting in the least amount of talent &amp; budget possible. A journey which they have failed, apparently, according to the abysmal sales.

    A butchered adaptation, neglecting to include fan favorite characters from the manga and removing entire arcs, complete and utter disregard of the great tone and atmosphere that was so carefully crafted in the first season, and rushing a once engaging story to high hell to make it a sloppy mess.<br />
<br />
This is horror. This is The Promised Neverland Season Two. And it&#039;s frickin brilliant. <br />
<br />
Now you may be sitting in your comfy chair, mouth agape in shock, and asking yourself &quot;Is this guy quite possibly insane?&quot; Probably. But I also had a revelation to something that you don&#039;t know...yet. But that&#039;s ok. I&#039;m here to enlighten

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386642">
        you dear reader. I came to realize that this season&#039;s apparent monumental failure was in fact done on PURPOSE. Yeah, I know it sounds unbelievable, but let me lift the veil from your eyes so you too can begin to appreciate this anime&#039;s efforts. <br />
<br />
Let me ask you something. What is the primary genre of Promised Neverland? The one that enticed viewers to watch and kept them craving more? The one that propelled this series to the height of popularity? It&#039;s horror. THAT is the driving appeal of this series. The first season did an excellent job with this. I&#039;m sure you don&#039;t need me to reiterate the solid pacing, timing, character growth, conflict, and more. But most importantly, it was a faithful adaptation to the source material. <br />
<br />
Now imaging destroying all of that. <br />
The once well defined and centralized plot has become convoluted, characters have become one dimensional, and the solid build up has just completely evaporated among other things. But also...taking an anime original approach!? Gasp! Now this is what I call true horror!<br />
<br />
There&#039;s only so far you can go when trying to instill fear into viewers through animation. Studio Cloverworks clearly knew that they had to take things to the next level, so instead of providing some exterior unnerving content like they did with the first season, they strike directly at the heart of fans by making them feel the utter despair of watching something they love turn into...this. Wow. Totally soul crushing. And absolutely genius!<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s why this season is clearly a subversive masterpiece. Shows of this genre aim to break the viewer through deep and dark content. Yet Cloverworks found a way to effectively do this through an entirely different approach, and it clearly shows. Seriously, the overwhelming animosity towards this season by fans is almost as scary as this show&#039;s complete and utter implosion.  I applaud them for their enlightened and forward thinking methods! But here&#039;s a warning. This only applies if you read and were a fan of the manga. Otherwise, it&#039;s just a incredibly lackluster sequel to a really good first season. Through watching, fans get to experience the purest, most rage inducing kind of horror there is.<br />
<br />
The horror of a butchered adaptation. <br />

    I debated whether it was even worth writing a review for the sham that is Yakuneba season 2 for about an hour or so before deciding that after all the time, energy and think pieces I’ve given this series, I should write one. <br />
<br />
Let me be clear, season 2 of Yakuneba, or TPN, whatever you prefer, is the biggest disappointment I’ve ever seen in all my years of watching anime. Those familiar with the manga will know that the content after season 2 has an astronomical drop in quality, but season 2’s material was the best in the series. Yet, for some unknown reason, Cloverworks

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386646">
        and the author decided to rewrite the story and condense the entire second half of the manga into 11 episodes and remove one of the best characters in the series.  Why? There’s been rumours that the author didn’t like the pacing of Goldy Pond(the arc that should have been adapted this season) and decided to rework things. Out of all the things that went wrong in the second half of the manga, Goldy Pond was not one of them.<br />
<br />
Now that I’ve got my manga reader tirade out of the way, I’ll explain just how atrocious this season was. “Well, I didn’t read the manga, so I might like it still, right?” No. Even if you were fortunate enough to not read the final half of Yakuneba’s manga, you will still find plenty of faults with this season. For one, the pacing is comically bad. Conflicts are set up and resolved in the span of a few minutes, often with huge leaps in logic. For two, the kids are often put into situations for which they have no training or previous experience and yet able to magically work their way out of with no casualties or so much as a scratch. For three, none of the mystery and tension that the first season or first half of the manga had are present. There’s never a need to fear for anything because you know Emma will talk no jutsu her way out of things. <br />
<br />
This season is just bad, not just because it butchered a fan favourite arc or cut out a fan favourite character and moments. It’s bad because it’s poorly written, poorly directed and a shadow of the former glory of TPN. Honestly, I thought it would be hard to get worse than the manga, but Cloverworks succeeded here on that front. If you want a somewhat mediocre conclusion to the story, check that out, but even then don’t expect much. Yakuneba S2 gets 2 dumpster fires out of 10.

    (TLDR at bottom, as always, thanks for reading.)<br />
<br />
*Obligatory I have read the manga statement*<br />
<br />
The Promised Neverland took the biggest L I have seen since creators allowing their creations to get an adaptation with &quot;Crunchyroll Original&quot; labelled along with it.<br />
<br />
Now, this is only a preliminary review, so I won&#039;t get on my high horse because for all I know, when the season finishes, this could be &quot;cha(tt)in bare wass&quot; of a review as my home country&#039;s colloquial language would label it as. But TPN feels like the ultimate betrayal an anime could ever make. I originally started TPN with the first season of the anime, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376158">
        loved it so much that I decided to read the manga, gaining the title of the first manga I have read onwards from the anime. But then everything came down. TPN suddenly collapsed on itself from what was initially one of the best introductions I have ever witnessed. In saying this, however, I am no one entitled when it comes to anime, just because I didn&#039;t get what I want doesn&#039;t automatically make the show bad. But it really did falter from its early stages, going on a route that I will let you judge for yourself if it is better than what was given before.<br />
<br />
Ok, then what? Where is the problem in the anime, as of now? Well, so many changes have been made that fans have speculated whether it will go original or not. Some say it is, others say otherwise, I am on the side of the latter in the name of hope, concurrently preparing for the worst. Again, I am no one entitled, I don&#039;t mind if the anime goes original, it might completely debunk any scorn received. Despite that though, this season seems to have grinded through with pacing taking no time in saturating what has just been given like some kind of anime speedrunner. I can&#039;t say that is good on the team&#039;s behalf, no effort is made to actually experience what the characters have just gone through and make it seem like some kind of haphazardly glued piece of shounen anime with plot armour enough to the Tsar Bomba feel like a raindrop, all clustered together for what is the equivalent of a Sunday morning jog in the forest. Characters are the same as usual, but nothing actually holds onto the first season with personality, that is everyone beside Emma of course because there has to be that one wishful optimist in the bunch at all times. I will give it that other side characters do receive more attention as of now, and should do so in the future unless all goes wrong, they actually have some character to them rather than small boy 1, small boy 2, small girl 1, small girl 2. I consider that a plus in my book.<br />
<br />
As for audiovisuals, the OST is pretty lit, I will give the anime that. As well as the OP and ED, they take time to get into like every new anime OP/ED. At first, I was sceptical of how much I would like it, but I have come out thoroughly enjoying it each time it plays. With visuals, CloverWorks do not disappoint, well that is assuming you didn&#039;t care about the various amounts of CGI used, which, to be fair, weren&#039;t something that I was looking forward to, but it wasn&#039;t bad in the least. Just average, I suppose. The 2D side of things undoubtedly looked lovely though, no complaints there.<br />
<br />
Overall, so far, I am full of questions for the anime&#039;s future, it might make or break itself, but considering the anime industry with top quality (very top quality, in fact, one of the best top quality I have seen) isekai prioritized about the rest, I am going to have to be with the pessimists and prepare for the worst. As of now. A tragic beginning I would say. Let&#039;s hope that changes, for the better.<br />
<br />
TLDR:<br />
Anime doing some funky speedrunning, seems to disrupt the mood of the story, with missing plot accompanying that too. Though audiovisuals are nice, very nice, same with audio used in every regard. A little enjoyable from what was given so far, but I have questions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I was somewhat conflicted with whether I should make a preliminary review or not considering the changes of the anime that has happened so far, so much uncertainty lol. Just decided I will write out another review for it, once the anime ends, on another site. But in all seriousness. How did they do that to TPN, bruh? They deadass murdered that goated story :feelsbadman:, the disrespect is unreal. Quite the unpoggers moment if I do say so myself 😔😔😔😔.<br />
<br />
Not too sure what to score it, not that scores matter anyway, we will just say 6/10, and be on our way. <br />
<br />
Edit: Revaluated my score. Put 6/10 instead because nothing is going well, and it is strongly implied that this is an anime original. Welcome to anime, I suppose. Still, people here saying read the manga, I don&#039;t highly recommend that because even the manga has plenty of flaws, though it is better than the anime. Take your pick.

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
Whenever a second season of an established franchise makes its return, I’m sure viewers will have a checklist in their heads. I’m talking about the type of checklist about content we want to see and those we won’t see. Because let’s face it, there’s no such thing as a perfect adaptation. Every anime has flaws and The Promised Neverland (TPN) season 2 is no exception. But when we talk about flaws, let’s just say that season 2 bit off a bite more than it can chew.<br />
<br />
With no recapping of events, we are right where we started from the conclusion of the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386636">
        season. That’s right, Emma and the kids are free at last from the terror and scheming Isabella. The one they knew as “Mama” had a dark secret and now that she knows what the kids know. Thus, the cat-and-mouse game begins in the TPN world. Freedom tastes very refreshing from Grace Field House. For the first time in their lives, Emma, Norman, Ray, and the children are able to take charge of their own lives. But being free also comes at risks. Let’s not forget that TPN’s outside world has demons, the primary antagonists of the franchise with a desire to consume humans. Will the kids survive in the outside world or will they become flesh and food?<br />
<br />
Watching this second season feels exactly what it wants you to think: a cat-and-mouse game where the kids are the mice and the demons are the cats. The kids not only have to evade demons but also must learn to survive in the outside world. Because let’s face some ugly facts: they’re not adults. Sure, there are characters who think like adults such as Norman but none of them truly have the experience of a survivor. The outside environment is a dangerous hazard of its own. Every day, these kids must find food, shelter, and means to keep each other sane. Despite being free, they are far from being safe as everyday tells a new chapter in their lives. Anything could go wrong whether it’s being caught by the demons, facing the threat of food scarcity, or even being betrayed by one of their own. It’s one of the more engaging storytelling part of the show as every episode brings a new development. The first few episodes shows Emma and Ray being reunited along with other kids. It doesn’t take long for them to begin discovering some truth about the past of the TPN world. That is thanks to two demons they encounter, Mujika and Sonju. You may think all demons are evil but in their own words, they take a different approach at surviving and refraining from consuming humans. Regardless, it’s important for the kids to learn as much as about the world as possible. <br />
<br />
One of the primary objectives of this season is for the kids to find a mysterious character named William Minerva. It is theorized that Minerva may contain valuable information about the outside world and perhaps even the key to their future. As each episode progresses forward, we learn more about the demons thanks to Norman’s return and his own discoveries. But at some point in this season, the kids run into internal problems of their own. It seems Norman himself has a plan to take down the demons but Emma has other thoughts. In her words and ideology, not all demons are evil or need to be eradicated. More importantly, Emma realizes that Norman is carrying too much burden on his own. In one of the climatic episodes, we see how Norman struggles to carry his plan and the violence that occurs in a town with demons. It highlights the personal struggle of Norman and what he perceives as the ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ thing to do. TPN Season 2 takes on this approach of characterizing its established cast. It takes a deeper dive into their personalities and shows how actions have consequences. Unfortunately, I can’t say this sort of characterization is well done. In general, Norman’s actions speaks for itself and from the start, he knew what would happen if his plans were carried out. Emma’s ideal clash shows the opposite spectrum of the two sides. Regardless who you agree with, both characters should know that every action has a cause and effect. In exploring these character emotions, it doesn’t really develop either character on a mature level although it does an adequate job at showing their personalities. And it’s sad for me to say, but if you’re in looking for character depth with other cast members, this isn’t the season for you. Outside of Emma, Norman, and Ray, most of the kids are treated more like fodder. <br />
<br />
What season 2 does promises is the way it sells its survival thriller story. Let me just say that while the characters aren’t the best actors of this show, the story itself is engaging with mystery, psychological, and thriller content. The Outside World built by the creator is fascinating that feels alive with the dangers of the environment and of course, the demons. Returning to this season are those monstrous creatures hunting for their food, or in this case, the escaped children. It’s more than just a cat-and-mouse game. It’s about survival. It’s about facing the future. And it’s about how kids can take back what they’ve once lost: their freedom and identity.

    You know all of that below? Ignore it, this season sucks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Amazing, this season is very promising, people are hating on it for being different than the manga, you won&#039;t be able to spoil it now, hahahaha, that&#039;s not an excuse to give it a low score, everything in this season is perfect so far.<br />
<br />
Story (10/10) - The story is following right after where season 1 ended, the story is being changed and that&#039;s probably for the best.<br />
<br />
Art (9/10) -  The same style was kept, with beautiful detailed scenarios and disturbing monsters, it has some use of CGI which is also looking pretty good.<br />
<br />
Sound (10/10)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376561">
        - The sound effects are realistic and effective, and greatly help you feel immersed while watching, the soundtrack is also pretty good, perfectly guiding your emotions through really well directed scenes.<br />
<br />
Character (10/10) - As always, all of them are likeable, you care about them and all have their own personality and importance to the story.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10) - One of the best animes of this season for sure, I would say it is the top 2 anime airing this season, really interesting, immersive, fun and enjoyable to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall (10/10) Yea, watch it, you&#039;ll have a good experience, that is, if you don&#039;t whine about the anime being (maybe) better than the manga.

    The writing choices made in this season defy my understanding at every turn.<br />
I&#039;d be less upset about them completely skipping an entire manga arc if they had a plan to replace it with something else, but so far we&#039;re halfway through season 2 and a main conflict hasn&#039;t even been established yet.<br />
<br />
The episodes since we diverted from the original story have been overwhelmingly spent on mundane stuff that does nothing to further the plot and little to develop the characters. We get overlong montages of riveting activities such as farming...cooking...sleeping...etc, a whole 5 minute sequence dedicated to catching and eating fish that goes nowhere, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378257">
        in case you wanted more they added another fish scene in next episode just for good measure! Oh also if you were worried you were gonna miss out on any of the daily meals these kids are having, don&#039;t worry they&#039;re ALL in there so you can watch breakfast, lunch and dinner in excruciating detail.<br />
<br />
After wasting all this time in both episodes 4 and 5 that they could be using to create some forward momentum in this show, the last 5 minutes were dedicated to tensionless action sequences against incompetent bad guys, that get deus ex machina&#039;d away at the last second. These action sequences also both serve to skip over vast amounts of the story that we could ACTUALLY BE WATCHING in place of this snoozefest.<br />
<br />
They even have the audacity to tease the manga arc that they skipped! In episode 2 they find what&#039;s supposed to be the inciting incident to an entire arc, they even make a huge cliff hanger out of it, but then the next episode the huge reveal isn&#039;t even spoken about by the characters, it just gets completely ignored and they go back to having a good time. The tone shift is beyond bizarre.<br />
<br />
TLDR: This show is a huge waste of time for everyone involved. Don&#039;t bother, read the manga instead.

    There are certain decisions I just don&#039;t understand and almost every single one made here is a complete disaster. Yes, it doesn&#039;t follow the manga at all except for some moments that were still changed anyway. I don&#039;t know why the author is doing this and was hoping they were just restructuring the flow of events but as each episode airs the more fleeting that hope is. I doubt Goldy Pond will happen at all now and this is an utter tragedy since I was really looking forward to this arc, one of the best arcs I&#039;ve read and they did my boi Yuugo and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378254">
        Lewis dirty. <br />
<br />
Story (1/10): This feels like a complete mess of the 5 episodes that have come out what takes place in these episodes is almost irrelevant except for maybe the last 5 minutes when something actually happens and things begin to develop at a snail&#039;s pace. The other 15 minutes is just them playing irl survival games and trying to go for a dystopian slice of life. Its boring and a waste of time, never in my life have I started fast-forwarding through a show just to find the content, that destroys a shows pacing for me, but thats terrible on its own already.<br />
<br />
Art (3/10): If this were 2005 I might think that the art and animation was pretty good but in 2021 this is pathetically average borderline bad. Demons look terrible as the episodes progress, animation is choppy with any fast movements, and the CGI while hardly used looks like something from the ps2.   <br />
<br />
Sound (6/10): Its alright, nothing is really standing out though since nothing happens outside the last 2 minutes of an episode so big sounds for intense moments or musical scores that strike a chord with me never really happen and since it takes so long to get to these moments I often stop paying attention to anything that might stand out both in a good and bad way.<br />
<br />
Character (6/10): Same thing, they&#039;re okay. They&#039;re the same group of youngsters from S1 doing the same thing and trying to survive, no major developments to note but they never stood out much imo compared to other shows. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (1/10): There is no enjoyment here, I&#039;ve technically already dropped it but I force myself to watch more episodes because I&#039;m a masochist and want to see how badly this could end up. The biggest offense here is tossing out an S tier arc with characters like Yuugo and Lewis that really made that arc one of the best. Instead, they&#039;re recycling Isabella because they don&#039;t want to lose the psychological thriller element thats so popular with S1 which never really clicked with me either. Goldy Pond really built up the world and its characters that ended with a big shounen battle but did an amazing job shaping it, now we&#039;re probably gonna get more outsmarting your outsmarting of me with writing that will likely be way worse.<br />
<br />
Overall (1/10): This is an insult, this is how you make sure that the best parts of your story will never be animated. Honestly if they did this after Goldy Pond I&#039;d be all for whats happening if the pacing was adjusted because everything after Goldy Pond was pretty average and stale as it went on. But now I doubt that will happen and this is honestly one of the worst anime I&#039;ve ever seen and it sucks to write all this because Ive been waiting for this season for 2 years. This review is hopefully to convince the lot of you who haven&#039;t read the manga to do so instead of wasting your time waiting and hoping for this show to turn itself around.<br />

    First season was a masterpiece to me. Brilliant! It was so good that made me read the manga. <br />
Was waiting for this second season for a long time so when it got released I was really superhyped. After finishing the first episode,I was pretty sure something didn&#039;t quite work out. It wasn&#039;t the art itself.Actually I think it was way better then the first season,but it felt like something was missing.The plot! There where like too many things missing already. But I gave it a chance,same as I did with Tokyo Ghoul. After finishing episode 4,that was enough for me to quit this &quot;original anime

    Season 2 of promised neverland is ATLEAST a 7, if you give it a 5 you&#039;re probably some elitist that is half-ass-watching the show talking about &quot;no suspense&quot;. <br />
<br />
Story: 8 <br />
 The anime is not going at a pace that is too fast for anyone to understand, if you cant understand what is happening so far then you must be a 5th grader beating his meat while watching cause the pacing is almost perfect in my eyes for what the anime is. That being said, this season is an action thriller more than a mysterious psychological horror anime, so if you give it a 5

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376273">
        based on that then you&#039;re just dumb. Despite the action thriller, it still leaves you with some suspense every episode, it gives you the best of both worlds. <br />
<br />
Art:8<br />
 Same as the first season, still very good, the CGI itself is also well done and should not be something that bothers anyone unless you&#039;re a nitpicking cry baby.<br />
<br />
Character:8 <br />
 Same characters from season 1 and they introduce some more mysterious characters what seems like every episode to leave you wondering what will happen next in the anime. The only problem I have is some of the kids coming out of nowhere, maybe I&#039;m tripping but half the kids I don&#039;t remember from season 1, ill have to look back at it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall: 9<br />
 The anime is a 9 for what it is, no manga read beforehand and no prejudice from the first season, this season is a 9 in my eyes although it could also be an 8 so far, I&#039;m very excited to see where this series goes from here.<br />

    The first episode of The Promised Neverland Season 1 is one of the finest I&#039;ve seen in all of anime. The dread and chills I felt at the end of that episode made me think I was beginning an amazing psychological thriller shounen.<br />
The season lived up to the expectations I had, it was filled with horror with elements of gore, didn&#039;t shy away from death and had a very menacing atmosphere throughout, along with one of the greatest pieces of music I&#039;ve heard in anime: Isabella&#039;s Lullaby.<br />
Now the season wasn&#039;t perfect, because I wasn&#039;t a fan of Emma as a character, a feeling that stayed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377916">
        with me right till I finished the manga; but as a story, TPN S1 was brilliant.<br />
<br />
And now with S2, its all gone to shit.<br />
<br />
As someone who read the manga, I knew this season wasn&#039;t going to be as good as the first one. The thematic shift from a psychological-horror to an adventure shounen wasn&#039;t the best decision in my opinion, but despite that I was looking forward to the new season in a stacked Winter 2021 calendar.<br />
<br />
Looking at the individual elements:<br />
<br />
Story: <br />
Easily the worst part of the new season. After I learnt that the author was planning to do an anime original ending to the season, I had my hopes up. I expected that he&#039;d maybe realise what made his story popular in the first place and he&#039;d try to incorporate those elements into the story. <br />
<br />
But what we have here is flaming pile of goop.<br />
<br />
The pacing is horribly off, there are some episodes which rush the pacing while others that are snooze fests. We have already had 3 instances of ass-pulls in the first 5 episodes itself. The standard blueprint of every episode till now has been: first half we show the children and their lives and how they live and what all they do to survive and how happy they are, followed by a second half of them getting attacked and being saved by someone else.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s terrible. It&#039;s disappointing.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Despite Emma being the main protagonist of the story, the first season for me was carried by Norman and Ray. While Emma isn&#039;t necessarily a bad character, she&#039; s extremely extremely bland. She&#039;s a one dimensional collection of all the good qualities of every shounen anime ever. She&#039;s a character who thinks they can save everyone without ever getting her own hands dirty.<br />
Ray is Ray, all his character development and story happened in the first arc so I won&#039;t complain about him. All the side characters presented the author with an opportunity to explore the various problems the children could face living in the wild, but what we have is 20 odd children living a year in shit conditions with shit food and not complaining even once.<br />
Idealistic bullshit.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
Not as good as expected.<br />
People in general are happy with the level of animation, but I am disappointed. The characters aren&#039;t sharp and the CG in parts has been awful. <br />
CloverWorks is a good animation studio which is also producing 2 other shows, Horimiya and Wonder Egg Priority which are both much much better both in terms of animation quality as well as storyline.<br />
So the overall animation is not bad, but its not amazing either.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Nothing special. OP and ED are decent, OST is nothing memorable.<br />
<br />
To summarise. The Promised Neverland S2 had a chance to undo the mistakes the manga made and create an amazing continuation to what was a brilliant opening season. But sadly, what we have is one of the most disappointing sequels in anime history.  <br />
<br />

    Now here you are looking at the 8 rating I&#039;ve given to a show that is unilaterally hated and disgusted, but let me tell you something before you jump to any conclusions. I am not a manga reader. Let me repeat, this is something I can be quite proud of, I am not a manga reader. I do not consume manga in any form. Now you might be thinking about all the crazy headlines and reddit posts made about how the show skimmed 100+ chapters and diverged from the manga skipping over entire arcs and characters, but I consume no manga, so why would I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review390165">
        care? Your favorite character was never shown, your favorite scene wasn&#039;t animated, well that doesn&#039;t effect me in the slightest. I have nothing but high regards for the show that pissed on the hopes of manga readers, manga readers whose sole purpose is to spoil the show in the YouTube comments section. Thank you CloverWorks, because of you I was able to watch a show without somebody telling me the ending of the show before the season starts, and for that I love you. But seriously, if you are an anime only the show is fine, it doesn&#039;t exceed the expectations laid by the first season but it was without a doubt enjoyable. The show never let down any expectations as the irrelevant manga characters and story which never came to be in this adaptation were not the reasons I was watching in the first place. What a time to be an anime only! And with that I take my leave as anime fans rejoice at the expense and sorrow of the anime spoiling, ungrateful manga reader.

    Promised Neverland Season 2... Where do I start?<br />
<br />
Well first off let me start by saying that this anime skipped a bunch of scenes from the manga, which really ended up ruining most of the amazing potential this anime had, but for the sake of the review, I will ignore the manga (Which was amazing), and judge this as an anime only product.<br />
<br />
With this in mind, I still consider this season to be pretty mediocre, if not a bit bad as a whole. Anyhow, this review will be entirely spoiler free, so let&#039;s begin.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
<br />
This story continues just where season 1 left off, but for some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review381923">
        unknown reason they decided that the best course of action was to use a bunch of time skips, I will pretend that I don&#039;t know what has occurred in the manga, and with that in mind, due to a lot of arcs being skipped, some stuff in this anime make no sense what so ever, and you are frequently left thinking: &quot;Why did this happen?&quot; and &quot;This makes no sense!&quot;<br />
<br />
Some other things outright contradict that which was shown in season 1, and we have no explanation on why these things occurred. Overall, a lot of scenes feel too rushed.<br />
<br />
Art: 3/10<br />
<br />
Okay so, with this category I will be considering art to mean both &quot;Aesthetics&quot; (How the show looks) as well as &quot;Animation&quot;, since that for me also effects the art of the anime.<br />
<br />
So in regards to Aesthetics,  a good number of scenes look visually appealing, so I have no complaints in that regard. However, there were no eye-dropping scenes, or moments where I felt like I wanted to paused the episode and just admire the artstyle.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, a few scenes were made pretty badly in the show, where you only see the characters with a pitch black background.<br />
<br />
Now in regards to animation... This might sound weird, but this season is barely animated... What I mean by this is that most scenes have characters just standing still, with only their mouth being animated when they talk. Furthermore, the camera angle frequently shifts away from the person talking, so most of the time all you see is a still image. There is also a couple of moments where we hear a sound effect or noise, and then the camera shows the effects of those noises, but doesn&#039;t actually show an animated character creating those noises.<br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10<br />
<br />
There wasn&#039;t a single soundtrack that caught my attention, and with that in mind, I really can&#039;t give sound a score that&#039;s higher than 5.<br />
<br />
Character: 5/10<br />
<br />
We still have the same characters that we loves from season 1, together with a couple of new characters. The main issue is that a good number of characters became way less interesting, and many of them don&#039;t feel like the same characters from back in season 1.<br />
<br />
Ray in particular for some reason rarely uses his brain this season, and just seems to do what everyone else is doing. While the rest of the children are completely emotionless, and just have the exact same emotion that Emma has, and do what she tells them to do.<br />
<br />
Emma is pretty much the same Emma we know and love, but for some unknown reason they made her a bit dumber than in season 1, and for some reason she believes that &quot;Love and Friendship&quot; is the solution to absolutely everything...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4/10<br />
<br />
My Enjoyment might be lower than most others because I read the manga, so having an anime that skipped so much might have made me feel frustrated and bored watching this, but for the sake of considering how you anime-onlys feel, I will increase the score from 3 to 4.<br />
<br />
Overall, there is a lot of repetition in dialogue, and with the characters acting blander than usual, mediocre music and poor animation, the scenes in this anime often bore me.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10<br />
<br />
TL:DR: The anime had a lot of potential but decided to skip a lot of things, and rush other things, most scenes feel poorly made and uninteresting.

    Imagine this, you decided to watch the first season and immediately fell in love with it. You binge-watch it twice in the same day, once in the sub and once in the dub, because it&#039;s genuinely super good. After that, you binge-read the entire manga. You hear a season 2 is coming out, you get super excited for it! Finally, it&#039;s here, you sit down and watch it and only get served out the biggest dish of the most disappointing thing ever.<br />
<br />
The average I got for tpn s2 comes out to 3.8, which I rounded to a 4.<br />
This season is extremely rushed. They cut out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review380849">
        tons of things from the manga that left a giant plot hole within the anime. The worst part of the story is the giant time skip. They just randomly jumped time in the story without telling us how much time had passed, what is happening, what had happened, and how they even got to where they are. Arguably, at the time of writing this I have only watched episodes 1-6, the remaining 5 episodes could potentially fill us in on those things, but having read the manga and seeing the current arc within the anime, I absolutely doubt they will. Because of the rushing and time skip, the characters have become very dull. They all feel like they have one personality trait, see for example; Gilda and Don just became the mother and father characters. Dull characters and a story filled with more potholes than a run-down highway, the promised neverland season 2 has become the first anime that I genuinely think about dropping.<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t have been this upset with season two if cloverworks had actually done what they said they would. They claimed they were diverging from the manga. But all they did was rip and tear apart the manga and just tried shoving what they had remaining into the anime.<br />

    Man what a disappointment this season was. I&#039;m not sure where to start. Keep in my mind that this is a preliminary review and it might change later but I highly doubt it by the direction this anime is heading to. <br />
<br />
First of all, this review is going to contain spoilers of the first 5 episodes but if you don&#039;t care then keep reading. <br />
Wow, I can&#039;t believe they literally cut out half of the story from the manga. I know that it wasn&#039;t CloverWorks fault but man the mangaka massacred his own anime. I don&#039;t know why he thought rushing and cutting out half

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378956">
        of the story was a good idea for the anime. They even removed a key character from the goldy pond arc who was going to be relevant in future plot points. But no they rushed all of goldy pond in like 2 or 3 episodes.<br />
<br />
Even if we set the manga aside, the anime is really terrible. Like it&#039;s so underwhelming and lackluster. Norman&#039;s reveal was so wack. One of the worst executed scenes I ever seen. The anime really out here giving BS time-skips without explaining anything. Also don&#039;t make me get on the characters, THEY ARE SO BAD. For example, Emma and Ray are literally making out of character decisions. You know how Emma is self-sacrificing in s1? Where she cared about everyone and would risk her life to protect them? Yeah, in s2 in order to test out if a food has poisoning they drew out LOTS. What the hell. Then when to kids were it Emma said &quot;No complaining&quot;. This isn&#039;t the Emma we know and love in s1. How on earth did Ray even agree to this?? This man actually went ahead with the 2 kids to taste if the food has poisoning together. This isn&#039;t the Ray we know. If it was s1 Ray he would&#039;ve thought out a plan to test if a food had poisoning or not without putting anyone in danger. Additionally, in the entirety of s2 so far, Ray hasn&#039;t said a single smart thing he would normally say in s1. They shafted his character and he looks like a normal character with no personality. The characters literally look like cardboard cut outs and nothing interesting in them. They really turned a whole psychological thriller horror anime into a whole badly executed adventure anime. At this point, the anime not making any sense and the direction and execution is very weak. Anime original? Where? All I see is so many scenes and arcs being rushed. I can&#039;t believe we waited 2 years for 11 episodes worth of rushed garbage.

    The Promised Neverland Season 2 is one of the biggest disappointments I&#039;ve seen. Not only did it fail the manga readers for the story but many anime-only watchers as well. The biggest driving force behind this was the decision to go for anime original content leading to many questionable decisions being made that shattered both the continuity of the story and the characters which are what made the show so appealing in the first place. Even from an anime-only standpoint, I would be hesitant to call it a &#039;competent&#039; adaptation.<br />
<br />
Now there&#039;s nothing wrong with going anime original since it can in some ways improve upon

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386698">
        the source material or give a unique spin to the story. But here, those benefits are nowhere to be seen. Due to this, the biggest issue this season suffers from is how rushed the story feels and it&#039;s incredibly jarring. A few episodes in, there are a whole slew of details that get teased then quickly brushed to the side leading to many unexplained plot threads (like who wrote the message in the bunker? What were all those flashing images at the end?). As someone who has read the manga, it&#039;s hard to ignore that an entire arc was skipped (dozens of chapters worth of content) which would have added meaningful worldbuilding, introduced interesting characters, and granted some much needed character development. Instead, everything is sidelined in favor of progressing the story as quickly as possible. But there was no real benefit to doing this since it caused the show to lose any and all tension it once had. Gone is the suspense and uneasiness by trying to outwit a higher power and replacing it are unnatural character motivations, teasing of potential plot points that never get touched on again, and senseless pandering. Most of the cast lacks any personality and don&#039;t really contribute to the overall story. Many of their motivations also become questionable later on because so much detail is omitted or simply not fleshed out enough. This becomes evident by Emma&#039;s behavior in the later episodes like when she allowed her siblings to eat mysterious food without a sense of danger as well as her spontaneous sense of justice. The &quot;reveals&quot; in the anime such as the condition of certain characters or the answers behind what the demons really are feel lackluster as they feel like they come out of nowhere with no prior buildup. Same goes for the main &quot;villain&quot; whose interactions and purpose later down the line feel underwhelming as they come off as a lame one-off enemy. Going anime original definitely killed this season which is a shame as I believe that the skipped content would have been entertaining and well worth looking forward to. After all, it would have been FAR better than this anime original content we got.<br />
<br />
Audiovisuals are much the same which is probably the only saving grace here since it does deserve to be mentioned. Although I would say it&#039;s a downgrade considering the hideous CG monsters in this season.<br />
<br />
To me it felt like the studio was trying to speedrun through the source material as quickly as possible leading to one of the most lackluster and head scratching finales I’ve seen. Granted even with the mangaka having a hand with the story for the anime leading to some drastic decisions, there’s at least some solace in having an adaptation no matter the quality. However, I do not believe it&#039;s worth sitting through. I highly advise avoiding this entry.

    In short: Turned me into a manga reader in 4 episodes, but not because it was good.<br />
<br />
In summary: I feel like an idiot for not reading the manga until the end, and deciding to wait for the anime. If I knew they were going to deviate this much from the manga, I wouldn&#039;t have waited 2 years, and would have read the manga straight away.<br />
<br />
Season 1 spoilers<br />
Long version: I did not expect S2 to be a carbon copy of S1, I already knew I was probably going to enjoy S2 less, given that the main cast had already managed to escape. I watched S1 to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376199">
        see how it would play out, who would outwit who, and for the overall thrill ride. After S1 ended, I ended up reading the manga up until chapter 60 or so, and decided to wait for the anime since I thought I&#039;d enjoy the anime more than I would enjoy the manga. But, somehow, they managed to take out so many plot points that even I started noticing something was weird. Is it too much to ask for a somewhat faithful adaptation? If they had adapted the manga like they did with S1, even without a panel for panel adaptation, I still would have enjoyed it.

    (TL;DR at bottom, most of this review will be comparing season 1 and season 2 of TPN. Before I start, I don’t know what happened in the manga, so I won’t be comparing the manga and anime and how they would differ.)<br />
<br />
“Reality is often disappointing” is a phrase that I would use to describe The Promised Neverland’s second season. Winter 2021 received many subsequent sequels to popular, well-known animes. Most of the sequels, in my opinion, lived up to its prequel. This isn’t the case for The Promised Neverland.<br />
<br />
Where do I even start? There are many, noticeable problems in (S2), but first, I want to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386652">
        address (S1) comparatively to (S2). (S1) had so many outstanding factors going for it. Despite being part of the shonen category, it had many boastful features that distinguished itself to stand out. Great characters that kept the story rolling, a good story setting (but had much more to be explained and explored, which this season tries to do), anything sound-related fits the tone of what a scene is trying to portray, and CloverWorks never disappointed once to highlight how much of a perfect fit of a studio it was for this work. (S1) delivered a suspenseful thriller with mystery, horror, and psychological elements. What (S2) aims to do is to create something of this nature, but it didn’t even reach the bare minimum. All the special elements of what (S1) gave is gone. Everything. There is no profound feeling when watching (S2). Watching this series fall to this caliber made me feel miserable because like I wrote, there are many features that distinguish itself from other shonens.<br />
<br />
Characters: 3/10<br />
Emma, in this season, pissed me off. Everyone did. All the characters turn into bland characters that have the most cliché ideals and motives. They don’t surprise me anymore with their clever tactics. They become unrealistic with ideas, and everything works out their way. They are faced with very few difficulties and little hardships - it very much feels that way to me. Very different from (S1). Ray and Norman become Emma’s sidekicks, and they don’t even have their own character to them. Their performance in (S1) is a different story, but in (S2) it felt like a drag to watch the kids explore the world outside of Grace Field House. Many missed opportunities and took the lazy route with all the characters.<br />

Story: 3/10<br />
While (S2) follows the story after (S1), the story following (S1) became unknown to everyone on what was prone to happen since it was an anime-original. But to summarize what happened, the story picks up on the kids’ escape, and they find out their lives may be even more at risk than it was, living in their farms. The kids face troubles, hardships, and some of their relationships with characters feel conflicted, blah blah so on, so forth. I’m not going to go deep in details since this is a spoiler-free review. Everything that happens is forced. It’s so boring. All the points in the story that seem crucial and vital are rushed and are missed opportunities to further expand upon. At the end of each episode, the story tries to leave off a cliffhanger with the most generic ideas, and following the start of the next episode, the idea is immediately tossed away for the characters’ own benefits. For example, the end of episode nine and the start of episode ten is so forced. Most of the episodes are poorly developed and written, especially episode ten. Sure, in the earlier episodes, it was alright and somewhat enjoyable, but following that, I couldn’t even keep up with what was happening. A million unanswered questions and plot holes are also very apparent. There was even a time-skip that I was unaware of... bottom line, (S2)’s story is pretty baddd...<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
Is it just me or do the kids look a little different? Emma’s face looks different from (S1) - not enjoyable but bearable. It could be a new art style or whatever, but it definitely is comparatively worse than (S1). Either way CloverWorks worked on multiple shows this season, so props to them. I’ve noticed some reviews say the camera angles were inconsistent, but it’s not like (S2) gave me any feeling remote to mystery or suspense - just dissatisfaction.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
The OP and ED are really nice to listen to, and I would go out of my way to listen to them, but unlike (S1)’s OP and ED, I feel like they don’t contribute to the show in any way. There were no moments in the story either that needed heavy, dramatic music like (S1) did, but I guess (S2) in the sound department is ok.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
Did I look forward to watching the new episode every week? For the first half, yes. The next half, not so much. All the characters are butchered, the story feels generic, the sound is a downgrade, the art is the same, no emotional feeling swelled up within me for the majority of this season, which contributes to my enjoyment of (S2) being less than average.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10<br />
The Promised Neverland (S2) filled me with false hope and dissatisfaction. I was promised a great series that I could look forward to. For the sake of this review, I watched all the episodes. There are redeemable parts in (S2), which is why I gave it a 4. Putting my opinion out there, but to say that (S2) was a complete atrocity is an overstatement. It does not live up to (S1) in any form, but (S2) is really, really just a poor version of what it could have been. Most parts of it are just mediocre. It’s a shame too since (S1) was one of the first animes that I would consider a near masterpiece as a shonen series.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: The Promised Neverland is the disappointment of Winter 2021 as a sequel to an anime. Its inability to compare itself to its prequel is what makes it fall short.

    PREPARE FOR A DIVISIVE REVIEW, but please remember that it&#039;s just my opinion and I completely respect those who dislike this sequel.<br />
<br />
The Promised Neverland Season 2- perhaps the most hated series I have watched during my relatively short anime history. Every single person I have come across has called it a &quot;betrayal to fans&quot;, a &quot;failure&quot;, or even utter &quot;trash&quot;. As a manga adaptation, that might be true. Then again, I haven&#039;t read the manga and simply couldn&#039;t care less. As someone who had no preconceived notions or expectations, someone who just wanted to enjoy the ride, I cannot stress enough how much I loved

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386767">
        it. Let it also be noted that I intend to read the manga and look forward to a completely different experience; if one was to separate the episodes from the chapters, I think they could be received better.<br />
<br />
Story- 9/10. Following from the previous season, in which the majority of the children escaped from  Grace Field, I was hoping for the world to be advanced upon. In fact, it did just this and more- we saw new creatures, both friendly AND unfriendly... We even got information on vegetation, which adds some detail to TPN universe. There were many chilled moments, which was great to see; it felt like we the audience could rest too, making the actual action much better. Technically, a lot of the story was rushed and clunky- certain moments were forgotten about or moved past very quickly, but the feels I got from the plot more than made up for it. In fact, the rushed tempo puts us in the kids&#039; perspective, who also lose sense of time and are constantly vacating from one place to another. Moreover, I felt it was a follow-up somehow darker than the original, thus I definitely cried a few times. The show STILL holds its emotion! The only negatives were that the plot twists weren&#039;t as great as their predecessor&#039;s; the story also felt too &quot;easy&quot; at times, everything fitting into place just to continue the show. I honestly don&#039;t mind because of the reasons to come though.<br />
<br />
Art- 10/10. This season had the chance to extend its animation quality more and (in some respects) it did. There was more beauty than the first, whether it was in the forest with pretty fireflies, or the night sky with sparkly stars. I particularly enjoyed the visuals for the OP and Ending. Although, the character designs, movements and certain frames occasionally felt stiff, or lacking life. There were definitely some visually bland scenes, which could have had a bit more energy- nevertheless, it&#039;ll still be a 10.<br />
<br />
Sound- 10/10. The Promised Neverland never breaks its promise of an amazing OST. All in all, I prefer multiple tracks on the album to Season One, which was still stunning, so that&#039;s saying something. There were new variations of &quot;Isabella&#039;s Lullaby&quot; relating to unexplored and foreign territories. My particular favourite, except for that emotional ending song, was &quot;The Evil-Blooded Girl&quot;; trust me, you&#039;ll know it when you hear it because it&#039;s EPIC! Now, let&#039;s talk about the Ending; the lo-fi type vibes were very unique and it quickly became my FAVOURITE anime song of all time. It really symbolised the freedom hoped for, the happiness and sadness that the orphans have to face and gave some &quot;laid-back, looking at the brilliant nature&quot; kind of vibes. The voice acting was also incredible, as per usual! This cast certainly knows how to do a realistic cry.<br />
<br />
Character- 9/10. Let&#039;s get the gripe out of the way first. There were a bunch of new characters that I honestly didn&#039;t care enough for to remember their names; they had absolutely no personality and were as forgettable as possible. Now that we&#039;ve got that cleared out of the way, our main characters were wonderful as always. Some of the less important children who we barely knew before got more of a chance to shine too, which was nice to see. I feel like the biggest let down to this factor was Ray, who didn&#039;t really add anything to the anime. Two new characters were brilliant though and I certainly enjoyed their presence. The show also explored an ominous route for one character in particular, which was very interesting to see. One more point; there are SO many characters who I could put in my Top Ten list (which you can check in my profile if you want)!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- 10/10. This rating is a no-brainer for me. Not a single time within this season was I bored, or wanting MORE; I just adored it. From the: relaxed moments, which put a smile on my face; dramatic scenes, which gave me actual chills; comedy between the characters, which was sweet as usual; sadness, which made me cry my eyes out, it was a wonderful journey. I also need to express my sheer ADORATION of the ending; there will be a lot of complaints and disdain, but I won&#039;t listen. The ending to this season and this show (I&#039;m assuming) was perfect, heartwarming and revolutionary to me. <br />
<br />
Overall- 10/10. It was this season that made me realise not to take other people&#039;s opinions to heart. Reviews are individualised to a specific person and opinions will of course differ. TPN S2 also made me happy not to read the manga first, as I&#039;m sure I would have a different opinion than what I do now. It doesn&#039;t matter though; I watched THIS first, loved every second and all in all, just about prefer it to Season One. <br />
<br />
Thank you very much for taking the time read; I truly hope you can find even a FRACTION of enjoyment from Season Two, but it&#039;s understandable if not. If you wish to take a look at my other reviews, or want to talk about anime, feel free to add me as a friend. I&#039;ll be sure to add back! :)

    As someone who loved the first season of The Promised Neverland, season 2 has been a massive disappointment to not only fans of the manga, but even anime onlys.  Also, this is the first show I have ever felt the need to review and post about simply because of how annoyed a singular season of a show could make me.  This review will contain some spoilers for season 2, however nothing major.  <br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
I don&#039;t really see how anyone could find this season&#039;s story even somewhat enjoyable; with aspects such as plot armor being a massive element of the story that not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review385159">
        only takes away so much suspense from the show, but also care for the character&#039;s actions.  If a bunch of 6-12 year old&#039;s can take down an entire armed militarily faction with absolutely no casualties or injuries, and then escape a gigantic demon with just bows and arrows, why should the viewer even be worried if any of these characters could die?  The usage of plot armor thing is one thing, but just how rushed the story feels is another.  It seems as if things just happen out of thin air for the sole purpose of moving the story along, such as Norman returning out of nowhere with literally no context at all.  There&#039;s no buildup to anything that happens in this season, with even the return of a main character being done in the most bland way possible.  Now, I am an anime only when it comes to the Promised Neverland, however the choice to not include fan favorite arcs from the manga (i.e. Goldie Pond) and characters such as Hugo in this season just seems like a slap in the face to the fans of this show.  However, even being an anime only viewer its hard not to sympathize with the manga readers as the season rushes plot points, uses an embarrassing amount of plot armor, and can&#039;t even invoke a single emotion out of the viewer besides &quot;meh&quot;.  Finally, the entire use of psychological suspense and horror that made the first season so lovable is just gone.   <br />
<br />
Art: 2<br />
Let me state something before I get into this section, I&#039;m a fan of Cloverworks as they have animated some personal favorites of mine, but WOW did they drop the ball with this project.  From the use of abysmal CGI for some of the wild demons in this show to the use of stills during action scenes, its almost comically bad.  Compared to the first season, you can see the lack of time that Cloverworks had to work with the second season, as the characters look dull, the demons almost look lifeless and not in a good way, and lastly the overall dark color pallet that falls onto the show just makes the setting and characters look bored.  Even the wildlife in the show which are supposed to make the world more vast are animated in the same bland fashion as everything else in this show.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
The sound of the show is one of the few saving graces for the second season.  I find the opening and outro to be really well done and sort of play in the childlike dreams of the escaped children, especially the opening which as an almost uplifting feel to it.  Also, I found the OST and a lot of the background noises for the environment to be realistic and immersive enough to draw you away from the horrid art.  The noises some of the wild demons make, though cheesy, are pretty well done and definitely remind the viewer of the beasts that these children are facing in the wild.  Also, the sounds show the savagery of the wild demons which shows a solid contrast between the wild demons and the civilized or in the context of the show, non-degenerated demons.  <br />
<br />
Character: 5<br />
The show starts with some very solid character development that peaks the viewer&#039;s interest, specifically in Emma after she kills an animal after hunting, but unfortunately, we have yet to see this matured Emma throughout the duration of the season.  Also, I&#039;m not a huge fan of Ray&#039;s arc as I never really saw him as a yes-man to Emma, but I guess it does stay consistent to the ending of the first season once he decides to go with Emma&#039;s plan.  One development I really liked was Norman&#039;s, but that to was shutdown very fast in favor of moving the plot along, as his character comes full circle in the span of two episodes.  Seeing Norman&#039;s determination and will to make a better world for his family no matter the cost was refreshing to the viewer, but once again that simply just did not fit the story of the show and was literally just forgotten and ignored after Norman enacts his plan.  Isabella also has a stupidly written arc, but I guess it does make sense in terms of the foreshadowing from not only this season, but the first.  I think a lot of the character arcs in the second season vary from ok to really good, however almost all of them fall into the ok tier because of the rushed pacing of the second season. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4<br />
The second season of Promised Neverland has a lot of mountains and valleys in terms of enjoyment for me.  The first 3-4 episodes were all very immersive and kept that feeling of the first season, however after that when the story began to stray off into plot armor and rushed pacing, is when the show gets terribly boring.  Most of the episodes following those first couple of episodes are bland, unimportant, and most specifically just stupid.  The reintroduction of Norman and &quot;death&quot; of Norman are basically 7 episodes apart from one another, which just shows how rushed this second season is.  However, episode 8 was very good in my opinion, and it was honestly a new feeling and vibe that the series has yet to give off, but this was very short-lived in favor of the boring story which has unfolded in front of us.  Its a below average enjoyment for the viewer, with moments of phenomenal writing and scenes, but the mid to borderline terrible episodes outweigh these great moments and episodes for me.<br />
<br />
Overall: 3<br />
It sucks to say that the Promised Neverland has went the Tokyo Ghoul route, yet here we are.  This season honestly feels like a cash-grab; an attempt to profit off and milk the fanbase of the show that was cultivated off the first season and manga.  The decision to cut some of the best parts of the manga was a bonehead decision, but ignoring that fact is the glaring truth that the show is just bad.  There&#039;s no stakes because of the plot armor, all the characters seem to fall in line with Emma&#039;s plan, the art makes a lot of the &quot;cool&quot; scenes fall flat, and much more.  The first season of the Promised Neverland was something truly special, a new-age show that had a brand new plot and lovable characters that seemed to prey for the writers, as the first episode had a death.  Unfortunately, the second season just can&#039;t hold a candle to the manga or the first season, as it struggles to build off the lighting caught in the bottle by the previous season and manga chapters.
