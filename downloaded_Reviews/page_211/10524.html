    This show is exactly my type of show, except I&#039;m not enjoying it as much as I thought I would.<br />
<br />
The first episode starts off alright as it seems to be an adventure/mystery show, but it starts to go downhill from there. <br />
Pros:<br />
No (over) melodramatic scenes.<br />
Cons:<br />
There are some heavily unnecessary elements in the show like the idol group and its appearance throughout the show. It has little to no significance in the plot itself. The male main character feels like a side character and the female major character is your generic overpowered loli. The concept of a city disappearing seemed really promising. It&#039;s quite disappointing.

    You know there comes a time when you need to watch something bad. Something you can learn from and get more experience so you can differentiate what is good and what is bad. What works and what doesn’t. Today, I have a great candidate to tell you about. An anime that perfectly fits what I am talking about and explain to you why that you should enter this anime at your own risk for the sake of your own tastes. <br />
<br />
Sit Back, relax and play some early PS2 games (You’ll understand in a minute) as I present to you the anime review for Shoumetsu Toshi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311116">
        or by its English name, After Lost. Lets begin. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10 <br />
<br />
On one frightful day, a city suddenly disappeared without a trace. They call this event, “Lost” and it left nothing behind. Except for one thing. Yuki, the only survivor of Lost had been experimented on by a mysterious company looking to find some answers about the events of lost. Until one day, she is broken out and escapes thanks to a courier by the name of Takuya. Takuya plans to take Yuki to Lost due to a message from Yuki’s father saying “Yuki, I am waiting at Lost.” With their plans set, they travel to Lost while slowly uncover the truth about Lost’s origins and the organisation working in the shadows. <br />
<br />
The story of this show is decent at best, even if it does like to sidetrack ALOT. It is very much cut up into different story arcs that last between 2-4 episodes that help cover the whole mystery behind lost and the villains’ motives. But I think around the halfway mark, it was starting to get pretty obvious as to what and who caused Lost to happen and I was just waiting to see if I was right (which I was). If that’s the case then the mystery isn’t exactly interesting is it? If the mystery is obvious well before we get the reveal as to what happened, then it isn’t exactly a well told mystery. Yeah sure, it was also obvious who was responsible for Lost from the word go but how it happened was meant to be the intriguing part.  <br />
<br />
As for the arcs themselves, some I would say are worth it as it does help give context to the story and unravelling the mystery. Although a couple of stories are pretty much filler in my eyes, (in a twelve episode series I might add) some of them were interesting and had some dark themes behind them to make you hate the villains more. Well I would if I had some kind of understanding as to what the villains’ ultimate goal was. That is a problem with the show overall at times because the story is trying to invoke an emotional response but it fails to do so. Sometimes it wants us to hit us with the emotional scenes before adding context as to why this scene should be emotional. If it did it beforehand but subtly, (Just to make sure it is not using obvious foreshadowing) then these scenes would have me invested; yet they fail to do that. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 1/10<br />
<br />
Every character in this show can be described as basically cardboard cut-outs with people drawn onto them. This is because they are just as interesting as cardboard cut-outs. This show does a poor job of making me care about these cast of characters because they are uninteresting to say the least and baffling at its worst. They are the kind of characters that invoke a sense of frustration in you because they can behave and speak like nothing can bother them; all for the sake of just progressing the plot. A scene from episode 1 where we hear what Takuya thinks of Yuki especially infuriates me because it is never built upon and could have led to some interesting narratives. <br />
<br />
Which leaves me to another criticism is that our character’s motives and personalities keep changing with little context in order to progress the plot. This is especially true when it comes to our main protagonist Takuya as his motives are never set in stone and changes his personality on the fly. Sometimes he acts as a loner, sometimes he acts like he’s actually a caring person, sometimes he’s cold, sometimes he’s selfless, MAKE UP YOUR MIND MAN! Then there is Yuki who is just as bland as a single, stale cracker. Despite having the goddess of Japanese voice acting herself, Kana Hanazawa, voicing her, she has no personality to speak of and when she tries to have an emotional response, it comes off very weak and uninspired, leaving me to not care for her at all. <br />
<br />
<br />
Animation: 1/10<br />
<br />
HOLY S**T! THIS CGI IS BAD! This is some of the worst cgi I have ever seen in an anime. The vehicles just look horrendous and doesn’t look like they even try to hide the fact it was cg. You see, this is why I said you should play some PS2 games, because this cgi looks like something from an early PS2 game. But even that is insulting to the PS2. I should expect this from Madhouse as they can’t do cgi well “cough cough, Overlord III, cough cough.” This show has been clearly shunted down the priority ladder and it shows. Animation is of nothing of note, the cgi looks awful and the character designs are just bland and rather genericwith nothing notable to mention about them at all. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 3/10<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is rather forgettable as well. There was not a single track that I can point out and say, “yes. I remember that one.” It was either too bland or didn’t fit with the tone of the scene well. It was just there and sometimes was drowned out by the sound effects of this show so sometime I couldn’t hear the damn thing. <br />
<br />
The opening for this show has a good song but is hampered by the crappy visuals. &quot;Kotae” by Mao Abe has some great pacing to it and I am a fan of how the vocals are used as well as the instrumentals. But there were clear cheap cuts in the animation department that brought it down for me. If it had better animation, I would say this would be a hidden gem of an opening, but the opening is just alright. <br />
<br />
The ending baffles me because it features an idol group that only appear for one episode. So to begin the series featuring them in your ending sequence will just baffle the viewer. Honestly though, it feels out of tone with the rest of the show and is something I skipped immediately after listening to it once. <br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
So yeah, if you didn’t get it by now, this show is bad. There were plenty of problems with the show’s story and mystery, uninteresting characters, awful cgi and forgettable soundtrack. There were only a couple of things I liked about this show but they were swallowed up by the many problems I have with this show. But it is nice to bash something that would not get defended in the slightest due to its s**tiness. If you are reading this by going through this season’s catalogue of shows or going through Madhouse’s library of shows. Please do not watch it. Your time is better spent elsewhere than this show..unless you want to experience what a really bad show is. <br />
<br />
<br />
My personal enjoyment: 1.5/10 <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall score: 2.1/10 Recommendation: Don’t f***ing bother

    TL;dr Don&#039;t waste your time on this. This show has absolutely nothing to offer except boredom.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Minor spoilers for first episode ahead.<br />
Shoumetsu toshi which roughly translates to Lost City is a story about a City and it&#039;s residents disappearing out of nowhere. A girl named Yuki is the only survivor and then there&#039;s a guy with a scooter who does whoknowswhat delivery work. He is requested by some scientific dudes (who do experiment on Tamashi of the people who disappeared in along with the city) to deliver this girl Yuki into the lost city because they think her father is alive. Now plot is not completely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307879">
        horrible and if it was executed even remotely decently it could&#039;ve been a somewhat not so boring and frustrating to watch but unfortunately it is. Not a single thing about the mystery element of the story progresses in any possible direction. Past on screen events are thrown into dump and overall it&#039;s a pile of boredom. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Not a single character is likeable. Main characters Takuya and Yuki are absolutely pain in the eye to watch. Yuki looks and behaves like a spoiled runaway child acting like a chicken leeching for sympathy. Takuya is even more annoying, a very bad mixture of Haruko from FLCL and Emiya shirou from FSN would be pretty appropriate<br />
to describe him. And yeah side characters are even less significant.<br />
<br />
Audiovisual:<br />
CGI is horrible. Takuya&#039;s scooter chase was like playing NFS on a 1995 PC with 5fps. Also there&#039;s no synchronization between sound and scene of the anime. First it fails to produce a hype moment then an overhyped music starts playing 2 seconds later which makes the already awful scene look even worse. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
There are plenty of good animes in this world. Don&#039;t waste your time on this. It neither have a even remotely decent story nor is audio visually acceptable.<br />

    This is a very long review/rant but this show deserves it.<br />
<br />
I am just wondering what happened here. Afterlost is an anime adaptation of a mobile game that with my sincere thoughts, I don’t get whose brilliant idea was to make an anime out of a mobile game that looks and seems to play exactly like JetPack Joyride. Although it has some story in it, but I don’t know  if the anime’s plot  is totally based on the game’s story but either way I am not here to review videogames, I am here to tell you about what it could be one of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311135">
        worst shows of the year 2019. <br />
<br />
First let’s begin with the biggest and atrocious flaw from Afterlost and it’s the stupid CGI Rendering. I can’t believe that it is 2019, anime studios can’t figure out or they don’t know how to mesh CG with 2D animation. Other countries where animation companies are located can pull this off way better examples of this are places like China and the USA I am not kidding. It seems that the director Miya was so focused on showing the work of the CGI team every time they could, they loved to give the viewer their fabulous and finished work of their awesome vehicles. In my opinion I believe Daytona USA from 1993 or any racing arcade game of the time have better graphics and design that this garbage. I even believe that Tsui no sora vehicles look better than this and that was done by an unknown company in Japan, but this, this is freaking Madhouse that we are talking about. A freaking well known animation company, that even One Punch Man fans are crying and screaming to them for a remake of OPM S2 after what has happened to their beloved show. <br />
<br />
Also, the camera rotating in this show is atrocious. I can’t believe it. When the camera rotates around the characters it is simply ugly. The only thing that comes to my mind are those transitions of paper Mario games but here it does not look good at all. It is so off putting and gives the sensation that the characters are not even in the background and are losing themselves from their own dimension. That’s something funny that I just said because that’s one of the main themes on this animated trash can.<br />
<br />
But continuing with the camera, oh dear, the camera direction is freaking garbage, did they ask Hiroshi Kimura the creator of ladyspo to help with the camera. Because the camera can’t be static at all or it cannot move flawlessly through the scene, it feels that someone with their own phone is filming something in front of those characters, but that camera guy is trying his best to not show how nervous he is. I really want to know who approve this brilliant idea for an anime and one more thing from the production team, the running animation it’s so wrong, not even Hannah-Barbera running sequences feel so stiff to watch like these ones. <br />
And that is just the technical part.<br />
<br />
So after discussing some of the terrible decisions for this to be broadcasted on tv, what is it about? With all my true feelings I don’t get this story At all. Well for beginners this anime should be called flashback the animation because the flashbacks that appear in this show, come out of nowhere. Sometimes you think you are at least trying to understand the story, but the flashbacks here don’t make any sense at all. They throw flashbacks whenever they think its good, but it doesn’t make any sense. The flashbacks scenes are so random that you don’t even know if the next scene is still part of the flashback or not. There is no transition to say this happened in the past or if this is happening in the current timeline.<br />
<br />
Ok I already said 2 keywords for this show those words are timelines and dimensions. From what my brain could at least tried to understand from this show is that scientists are trying to make a parallel universe machine and with that machine do some research because this scientist, I believe, it’s from another dimension and is trying to make the worlds join together. But an accident happens, and they destroy parts of a city in Japan. All the people that were around that area disappeared except for this girl who is the daughter of the scientist and whose name I already forgot because I don’t give a damn about these characters at all. So, she is captured by an agency to examine her to see why she was the only one that survived and then comes the lazy characterization of the other protagonist. Then we meet as our next protagonist an idiotic amalgamation between Hei from Darker than Black and Kiritsugu from Fate/Zero who rescues her. Cheap Kiritsugu says that he is working as a contractor for another research lab, so they could restore the humans that disappeared from the city.<br />
<br />
But after trying to go back where the destruction happened, they are chased by this psychic man and there are 2 freaking things that I don’t get. First ,The Moped this carbon copy of Kiritsugu is using must be from some stronger metal that maybe is not part of the periodic table because the thing gets hit a lot and it is still rolling. And the other thing is this, the girl protagonist has Stand/Persona powers and you want to know what else they copied? There is a carbon copy of Niko Yazawa from Love Live. Just how low has madhouse gone? I’m speechless. <br />
<br />
So what is Niko Yazawa doing here? See the thing I said about timelines is because some parts of the destroyed city when you enter through them, they grant you access to a time loop of something that happened before the destruction of the city and they have to fix it so they can get out of it. But the whole situation is simply worthless because the show tries to make us feel bad about these characters and the sad moments but in the end they aren’t really there, they could be dead, so what’s point? they don’t show something for us as viewers to be invested on these dead characters.<br />
<br />
and since I am talking about characters, they are simply bland and boring. It is the type of boring that honestly you would wish each episode to disappear from your eyesight as soon as possible.  <br />
<br />
The Girl with JoJo powers is always sad and has depression and I get it; she lost her father, but she is just a depressed emo and that’s her whole character arc.<br />
<br />
The other protagonist, the edgy guy, is always with his serious look and frivolous attitude but he has no substance or anything to make him look cool like Hei from Darker than black. Even they present his past and it tells us that he was working as a helper in a kindergarten when he enters a timeloop but that doesn’t make him memorable, it’s just something he did before he started doing his actual job as a contractor.<br />
<br />
The other characters are just not worth mentioning one by one. Well maybe I could talk about the antagonist and they are so badly made because this show every time, they throw a plot twist that the “bad guys” the protagonists are facing, they are not really the true bad guys. For example, we begin the story and they present us that a society are the bad guys, but they in the end of the episode they weren’t the bad guys because the girl who oversees the operation and tries to kidnap Knockoff Hei says she will help him because she loves him. It is so ridiculous to hear the power of love for this crap. <br />
<br />
Then we meet the brother of the girl with Jojo powers and we discovered that he has JoJo powers as well but he isn’t the bad guy neither after they destroy his persona and he returns to normality.<br />
<br />
Then we finally discover the true bad guy, and it is the scientist that was working with the JoJo stand user’s father that was behind all of this, because the father of the protagonist was from another dimension, he decided to have children with a woman of the current universe for that reason he wants to destroy the world and humanity. I suppose at that point I was just yawning over this half ass explanations that they were introducing just for the sake of telling a dump story.<br />
<br />
Another aspect that sucks so much about these characters is that when there are scenes involving the death of a character, they try way too hard to build suspension from this scenes and they do this always when an episode is ending, leaving a cliffhanger for the next one. Good thing I marathoned this. The cliffhangers are awful and when someone dies, I simply don’t care about them. I don’t give an ass about their lives, I don’t know what good intentions they had, I don’t care about these characters. Another explosion that could destroy their world could happen and I’ll be laughing about the whole situation that happened to them. At least I wouldn’t be looking at horrible polygons that try to look like cars.<br />
<br />
Continuing with the characters I think I know where the budget went, and this just an opinion not actual facts, but they decided to hire  well-known actors as Tomokazu Sugita and Kana Hanazawa as our main protagonists. I will say this they are trying their best with that crappy script, but the feeling is not there. Not even their unique voices can’t redeem the characters in this show and the only music score this production has besides the opening and ending, it’s an weird electro pop song that doesn’t fit at all and that’s the only background music that I can remember.<br />
<br />
Finally let’s discuss how this show ends, but if you really want to discover by yourself and join in my suffering continue reading, so the ending will leave you with a WTF? Face because it doesn’t explain anything. The father scientist just tells his daughter that she can rewrite the timelines but all of the sudden the bad guy becomes a metal titan and wants to destroy the world until, it is discovered that some girl that I don’t remember to what organization she was part of shoots him and the villain finds out that she planned this all along because she knew the different outcomes of the different timelines for some reason. I don’t get it at all. This show tries to get you invested with its mindfuckery although it is pathetic and idiotic. <br />
<br />
Don’t waste anytime on this one. Madhouse has put their reputation to the floor developing an anime like this one. I just give it a 2 because whenever there was a bad cgi scene I was laughing my ass with how stupid it looked. Thanks for reading this review. Sorry if I made some grammatical/spelling mistakes, English is not my first language. Thanks and take care in whatever you do.<br />

    When you think of Madhouse , you think of great shows like HxH,Opm,Death Note, shows that excelled in story, animation, sound, you name it. Sooo, this show must be great, or at least average...Well, it&#039;s awful.<br />
Spoilers !! <br />
<br />
The story is the only decent part about this anime, you follow the main characters,Yuki and Takuya, fighting the big bad guys to get to a big hole. Where supposedly, Yuki&#039;s father resides, but that hole is dangerous and has a lot of mysteries that surround it and with the addition of,  &quot; different universes&quot; / &quot;parallel universes&quot;, it makes a pretty good story. Buuut, for some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311281">
        reason there are some people that have different powers, like to make things disappear, telekinesis, summoning your old bodyguard that was dead, nothing amazing. They were poorly explained, and in my opinion the story would have been better without them.<br />
The ending was horrible, they tried to add some moral points to the story, they failed miserably, at the same time they tried to make it sad, but it was such a clusterfuck that it didn&#039;t get me at all. There were some stupid decisions regarding some characters, that had no reason at all.<br />
<br />
The characters were very forgettable, bland. There were some interesting ones, but didn&#039;t have that much screen time or were killed right after they were introduced. Suzuna was one of them, most of the series they teased that there was more about her but, they didn&#039;t do anything major with her character until the last 2 episodes.<br />
There were also some characters that were added for the sole purpose of getting them killed, so that character x or y will get involved with the story.<br />
<br />
The animation .... OH BOY. The CGI reminded me of overlord 2&amp;3, the animation in general was meh. There were some cool shots that were destroyed by the lack of detail or the addition of CGI.. The character designs were pretty good, most of them at least.<br />
<br />
The sound design was ok, nothing amazing, the OST was very forgettable. The VAs did a pretty good job, it seemed that they tried to give life to these cardboard characters.<br />
<br />
The OP and ED were all right, the OP was energetic , getting you pumped up for the start of a new episode, the ED was calm, I liked the voices of SPR5.<br />
<br />
Overall the premise was good but it ended up as a train wreck, except if you want to see how a horrible anime looks like, I don&#039;t recommend you watching it.

Shometsu Toshi is a real masterpiece. Never before have I been so amazed by a work of fiction. It is pure perfection. The characters, the setting, the plot, the small nuances, foreshadowing, sound effects, music, cinematography... the list goes on and on and on. I seriously don&#039;t know where to start with this anime. <br />
<br />
To be honest, I watched it as a joke because I got the character in my gacha game. But never did I think that it would be the best anime of all time. First, where do I start? I don&#039;t know where to start. Please. Theres too much to this anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review379793">
        that is perfection. I think the surge particles (haha, Shoumetsu Toshi reference!) got to me and caused me to forget about where to start.<br />
<br />
First, I will start with the characters. They are amazing. Most of them are introduced in the episode where they die, which adds to the despair and suspense that the show instills in the viewer. This show is not for the faint of heart. There is real hurt. Real pain. Real trauma. Real despair. Real life. This show is so meaningful. The characters are great. Theres the protagonist, Yuki, who has experienced so much suffering. Theres Takuya, the courier, who didn&#039;t fulfill his tragic past. And all the other ones I don&#039;t remember the names of, like the magician guy who Twitter cancelled the evil Lacuna. All these characters have an amazing story to tell and tell it in a way that causes the viewer to truly understand their pain and hurt and suffering. Which only makes the triumphant ending even better.<br />
<br />
The show is amazing the plot is amazing. The plot is that there is a giant hole that they must go to the bottom of because a message from Yuki&#039;s supposedly dead parent emerged from the area. The hole was formed by The Lost (which is a very cool and cool sounding name) which caused a whole city to disappear. They finally make it to the actual hole in the last episode which was the coolest episode. The ending was amazing. You see,<br />
along Yuki&#039;s journey, many people die or lose their siblings or something (she lost her younger brother) and this woman wiht green hair dies and this woman with brown hair dies and this guy with purple hair almost dies but didn&#039;t until the last episode, and she is given the choice to give them all a perfect world, reset the universe, where they can all be happy with no repercussions. She is the only one who can make this choice, the choice given to her by her supposedly dead father who is a Data Man now. Of course, she chooses to not reset the world, because she would be sad if everyone didn&#039;t go through all of those experiences. The Lost is still growing ever larger and in a few decades, will swallow the whole world unless Yuki chooses to reset the universe (which she did not do). This is an extremely meaningful ending that means a lot because it shows how the right choice isn&#039;t always the good choice. I think we can all learn from Shoumetsu Toshi in this way. <br />
<br />
One last thing... this anime has EXTREMELY ACCURATE SCIENCES. They talk about parallel universes which is a real scientific concept. I don&#039;t see your Steins Gate talking about parallel universes now, do I? They even mention SURGE PARTICLES which are really scientific and make you lose your memories unless you are from another universe. I&#039;m disappointed they didn&#039;t mention Alpha, Gamma, or Delta particles, but I&#039;m sure its simply because they realised the simple minded viewers wouldn&#039;t understand such incredibly conplex scientific concepts which, if you ask me, was quite kind to the viewers to make this decision because without it we would not be able to understand the magnificent story of Shoumetsu Toshi.<br />
I give this anime a 10/10 and the joe fortnite award.<br />
<br />
I cried. Every episode. At every single cut-away gunshot I cried. i thought they would die... but they didn&#039;t. The pure resilience despite the despair showed the light of hope at me and taught me many valuable lessons. <br />
<br />
Please. Watch this anime.

    TL;DR An interesting take on minimizing narratives and letting the story tell itself<br />
<br />
My first impression of it was probably &quot;Another Dimension W&quot;, but after finishing it felt more like &quot;A better executed Steins;Gate&quot;.<br />
<br />
Presentation was probably the highlight of this show. It was an interesting take to construct the plot without being heavily reliant on narratives, flashbacks and other common methods of leading the viewer. Instead, it relies on your own implication to understand the context of events.<br />
<br />
Dialogues were constructed in a way that felt more natural, and creates a tone that is more precise to the context, all at the cost of being heavily reliant

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311938">
        on the viewer&#039;s own understanding to comprehend what was going on.<br />
<br />
Unlike other animes, most of the story progresses linearly (as in ascendingly, following the events one after another). In addition, it doesn&#039;t delve much into side stories (different perspectives) that might help explain certain elements of the plot, which is often seen in animes (and can get kinda intrusive at times). Instead, it tries to centralize on a general perspective of everything that&#039;s going on, and stays on that perspective, letting the viewer figure out the rest.<br />
<br />
Even having fragments of the plot unexplained, plot elements were still woven together very cohesively. (As in everything makes sense)<br />
<br />
Art quality is so-so average. Character proportions are sometimes slightly out of place, and there is an apparent lack of character design. Other elements were plain and absurdly generic, but overall, essential elements were present, so there&#039;s really nothing to complain. Even though the quality is below-average, it is still pretty enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Audio is average. Shoumetsu Toshi didn&#039;t really utilize background audio to build up most of the atmosphere like other animes, since the plot doesn&#039;t really revolve around an auditory theme, and is more reliant on implied context. When it does however, it&#039;s pretty average, but is kinda nice sometimes.<br />
<br />
Characters were very distinct, and their traits were introduced without having to explicitly induce flashbacks or long backstory sessions. Character depth was constructed as the story goes on, without really feeling intrusive when they were supposed to.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a pretty interesting take on minimizing narratives and letting the story tell itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this to someone that likes sci-fi?<br />
<br />
Probably yes! As a geek myself, a lot of technical elements were portrayed quite accurately (compared to other sci-fi animes anyway, you can&#039;t expect something more accurate like Half-Life in animes tbqh), albeit still being unrealistic. (as all animes should be)<br />
<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this to someone that just wants to have a good time watching anime? <br />
<br />
Maybe, the ending is kinda weird so it might left people pondering in confusion.<br />
<br />
<br />
How about someone that&#039;s just bored?<br />
<br />
The anime is an interesting take on using less narratives and more viewer implication, do check it out!

    I gave Afterlost a chance because it was helmed by Madhouse a studio that has a good track record for the most part, but boy was I bored and disappointed fast.<br />
<br />
From what I heard, this is a mobile game adaptation. Mobile games do not exactly have a good reputation, so with this show&#039;s story feeling very disjointed; it just reinforces this bias. The story is just a mess I never knew what was going on or why it mattered. I heard from a friend it took them till around episode 8 to finally rectify that.<br />
<br />
It has a decent pop song, but it feels so forced

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310635">
        when its played during the show. It feels like something you should end an episode.<br />
<br />
As for the characters I would like to say they were forgettable but it one of the rare cases where there was nothing to remember about them in the first place. Most were either very bland or stereotype characters absolutely nothing of note.<br />
<br />
There is nothing to be gained watching this stay away and find something better.

    Great Premise, poor execution; mostly in the editing<br />
<br />
This type of anime has been done before many times in the past, However, After Lost is one of the worst most forgettable executions of this decade. There is good to it though so let me tell you what I liked about this before I go into the bad.<br />
<br />
The Good<br />
The premise is really great, not gonna lie. There are several underlying themes about coping, loss, understanding, and forgiveness. Underneath a few good episodes sprinkled throughout the series; I&#039;m sad to say that&#039;s pretty much where the praise ends.<br />
<br />
The Bad<br />
The series feels empty, what I mean is the series

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318190">
        has a hard time finding it&#039;s footing. For example, a few episodes start about like 15 minutes in so they had had to run those 15 minutes in this annoying grainy flashback. There are multiple times the series thinks it wants to drive but that only really happens for one episode. On top of that, we&#039;re expected to feel for characters we just meet and have very little investment in. This get&#039;s better near the end but it&#039;s a little late to do that in the series. The art is passible but the Animation is so lazy, I thought a production as high as this one would at least reanimate a scene if they are going to show it again. Speaking of showing it again, this series love to reiterate by showing the same twice in basically 10 minutes apart from eachother.<br />

Wrap-up<br />
After lost is a mess of show that could benefit from better editing and maybe a rewrite or two but if you want to give a try, you&#039;re very much welcome to. Anyhow, thanks for reading.

    This show seemed to have no idea what it was trying to accomplish. At the outset, there was action-packed scenes that felt like a decent B-list action movie: car chases, gunfights, explosions--Michael Bay would approve. That drops off significantly, however, and the action sequences become far less intense, shorter, and much less interesting. <br />
<br />
The story itself was fair, but the storytelling was poorly paced and tended to jump around a lot, especially into bits of backstory with no bearing on the main story (*cough* Idols *cough*).<br />
<br />
Aside from that, there are several very questionable choices made in the animation and presentation that really bring the enjoyment

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311191">
        of this series down.<br />
<br />
The breakdown:<br />
<br />
Story - 5<br />
<br />
It was decent, but could easily have been told in half as many episodes. The awkward pacing and lack of any character development was another nail in the coffin. <br />
<br />
Art - 3<br />
<br />
The characters themselves were drawn well and generally I liked the designs. Lets take a minute to discuss the questionable choices though.<br />
<br />
First and foremost, the CGI: the CGI in this was so basic and bland, it looks as though it were animated by an amateur that just picked up their first book on how to draw CGI. The vehicles looked awful on the hand drawn backgrounds and really detract from the scenes&#039; impact.<br />
<br />
Second and possibly more annoying is the handy-cam effect. Most shows pan the camera slowly and smoothly across the screen for a nice effect. This show insists on having the camera shake around when panning and even when focusing on a character. So, like someone using a handy-cam, the image is constantly shaking around and it simply looks unprofessional and bad.<br />
<br />
Finally, while speaking of shaking, this show has such an attachment to the twitching eye effect, that over 90% of the camera shots of the characters&#039; faces have their eyes twitching/shaking. Sometimes, for whatever reason, their whole face shakes. Again, this is used so excessively that it looks bad and gets somewhat annoying to see.<br />
<br />
Sound - 5<br />
<br />
The soundtrack was fair. Mostly forgettable, but the music fit the scenes well.<br />
<br />
Character - 3<br />
<br />
Absolutely the most generic characters I&#039;ve seen in a while. There was little to no development of characters and the character interactions were all pretty stiff and inorganic. The emotional scenes failed to evoke a response since the characters were so bland and lifeless.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 3<br />
<br />
I was enjoying it at first, but after the initial action scenes left, so did my enjoyment of the show. I stuck around to see if it got better--it didn&#039;t--and also to learn the mystery behind Lost. Disappointing more often than not.<br />
<br />
Overall - 4<br />
<br />
TL;DR<br />
<br />
What started out with an interesting premise, quickly fell flat with just sub-par...everything. Between the shaky camera and faces, the terrible CG, and the poorly paced storytelling, it was tough to watch this show from start to finish.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t recommend this show unless you are a fan of the game. Otherwise, it&#039;s just not worth the struggle to watch it.

    Afterlost started off very shaky initially and seemed all over the place. It was difficult keeping up with the story and names of characters. Frankly, I wasn&#039;t sold on the first episode or the few that followed it. It wasn&#039;t horrible, it was average is all. <br />
<br />
The plot continually hopped all over the place throughout but by the 6th or 7th episode, I was able to keep up. But still, this made understanding the plot super confusing. <br />
<br />
One of the greatest weaknesses was that majority of the characters were flat and static, which made it hard to connect with them as a viewer. I didn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353117">
        mind the bad CGI in action scenes as much as I minded the one-dimensional characters. <br />
<br />
The only scene that was done well was the scene about the two brothers, Tsubasa and Yoshiaki -- this, is what I believe to be the show&#039;s saving grace for me. For once, I FELT something while watching the series. I felt connected to a set of characters for once. And it seemed that following this scene, I felt for other characters along the way...but at this point, I was about 10/12 episodes in.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d say I enjoyed this anime nonetheless, so I give it a 7/10. It wasn&#039;t horrible but it wasn&#039;t phenomenal either.

    This anime will go down in history for me for having a first episode that almost ruins the rest of it. This is how you do not start off a first episode, by just showing something and barely explain it enough,and then tell how its such an important thing. So important that its the only personality trait for all the characters to have to figure it out.The characters are so boring.The main character is basically Plank from Ed Edd and Eddy. The main girl&#039;s brother is one of the worst anime characters ever point. blank. PERIOD, and the best character is a guy who everyone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333034">
        calls a geek in the show. Main villain is just as distinguishable as all the other 50,000 unimportant characters introduced in each episode, Main character girl has powers, then she doesn&#039;t, and then she does , and then basically becomes God in the end because LOL EPISODE 12.After episode 2 and onward, I was just over this bullcrap.UGH, i have never felt that I have lost years of my life just watching an anime until now.The ending of the show literally has a scene that is like the final episode of Evangelion, but way way way worse.Sure it was competently animated....but what is the fucking point, in all of this.<br />
<br />
Overall-Just what is the point?/10

    No spoilers.<br />

This show was an entire mess.  It was pretty enjoyable for the most part, but it just failed in so many aspects, despite having so much potential.<br />
<br />
The world they establish is deep and nuanced.  It&#039;s quite engaging and left me hungering for information about what happened and why things turned out the way they were.  But it quickly gets really messy with way too many concepts being tossed into the mix, and left unexplained.  I&#039;d say about half of the world&#039;s complexity just ended up being wasted and that they could have really trimmed a lot of the fat (Akira)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311983">
        and put more emphasis on the storyline.<br />
<br />
The characters are mostly shallow and undeveloped.  I found myself caring and knowing nothing about any of them, and felt like once again a lot of the fat could have been trimmed with regards to character writing.  Takuya is an entirely empty character with no development.  The best characters are meh.<br />
<br />
Art and sound are alright, 3.6 roentgen.<br />
<br />
In general it&#039;s just trying to do too much and not treating its own concepts seriously enough.  The scooter needed to go, it was entirely out of place.   I give it a 4 because it&#039;s generally okay and isn&#039;t horrible to watch, but it&#039;s a mess.

    In short, this anime has couldve been better if given time and more development, its disappointingly underwhelming.<br />
<br />
Spoiler Ahead chaps.<br />
<br />
<br />
The story itself is good, a city has been lost but the people aren&#039;t sure of the cause so they try and find it out and then they discover that theres still life in the &quot;Lost&quot; so they try and do stuff here and there to find out if they can make contact with the peoples inside<br />
<br />
So uhm, like, this stuff and that stuff happened, and yeah, the &quot;Character&quot; arc type thing is really pointless but theyre not bad... kinda adds a little background to the characters.<br />
<br />
6/10

    To be honest, Afterlost is disappointing. When made  by madhouse, You&#039;d except something outstanding but it&#039;s not only that it&#039;s disappointing, Even without thinking this would be good because it was made by madhouse, It would still be bad. The art isn&#039;t that unique, It&#039;s something Average you&#039;d see in an anime like BNA, Great Pretender, or Kill La Kill. Of course while some people enjoy Afterlost, I personally didn&#039;t like it. The overall idea was good, But the execution was horrible. The Artstyle and Story just couldn&#039;t keep me hooked, some of the characters were enjoyable, while others just didn&#039;t make sense to

        me. I dropped it because I honestly couldn&#039;t process what was happening. While I don&#039;t actually suggest this anime, you could just try it to see, because of course it does have fans, But it was honestly super confusing to me.

    Okay, yeah, so maybe it isn&#039;t the best anime. BUT yall needa chill. I don&#039;t have a huge &quot;oh look at me I&#039;m special&quot; speech about how much I like (or in everyone else terms- hate) the show. Don&#039;t listen to someone else opinion, because maybe you will like it. Does it have the best animation? Nah, but imo It&#039;s better than some popular anime I&#039;ve seen. This IS someones good artwork, time, and effort. I honestly think some people have gotten their expectations so high for stuff that they are so terribly show snobs. Maybe it dosen&#039;t have as much action as other action

        anime, BUT IT ISN&#039;T ANOTHER ANIME. Overall I did like it. Some people have a hard time following the story, but I understand it. I also like the fact that it isb&#039;t trying to just shove romance into it randomly and make that a huge part of the plot. Opinions are opinions, but some people are so fixed on taking a dump on it. To anyone who reads: PLEASE FORM YOUR OWN OPINION.

    Afterlost is an enjoyable anime, but pretty average compared to other animes out there.<br />
<br />
At first, going through the first 2-3 episodes, I thought this anime was going to fall pretty flat. They introduced random characters that held no plot to the story at, and the world of the anime wasn&#039;t introduced very well. Halfway through the anime, the story really starts to pick up and the characters become a bit more &#039;real&#039; and not just characters for looks. The story is mediocre, but I enjoyed it til the end.<br />
!A bit of spoilers!<br />
The only real annoying thing in this anime was the continuous mention of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review412205">
        anime&#039;s Idol group characters that lead to nothing in the story. They make those characters seem like they&#039;ll help move the story along, but it&#039;s close to just being filler content. The anime could&#039;ve cut them out and there wouldn&#039;t be much difference.

**This is my opinion so please don&#039;t get too mad at me.** <br />
Words can&#039;t describe how much I dislike this anime. I like to think that I&#039;m a generally positive person, so I gave this show the benefit of the doubt. I watched it about two or three months before COVID-19 began, so I hadn&#039;t really experienced a crisis that directly affected my life (WOW, I can FEEL the privilege coming from that statement, sorry). So I was willing to cut the protagonist some slack, thinking &quot;Maybe if I were in her shoes I&#039;d do the same thing,&quot; but NO I would not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review413500">
        make the decision she made. After experiencing a milder version of what she did (she lost her whole family, I have not; but was still affected by a world changing event) I can say that I would not do what she did, OH MY GOD!!! What was she thinking?!? She could have fixed EVERYTHING! But the show tries to make her sound like a SAINT! Geez, if I could prevent COVID from happening entirely I wouldn&#039;t even hesitate. Though I will say this to its credit, I really liked the main girl&#039;s hair I thought it was very pretty.<br />
Thank you for your time, and if you like this show; I&#039;m glad you can find something enjoyable about it.

    I&#039;m not really sure what to make of this anime. It was interesting in the beginning. Though it was left to the last few episodes to figure out what was going on. Not in a mystery type of way more of a &quot;what the heck is going on&quot; type of way. The characters weren&#039;t fleshed out. I like the mc male, the female was okay and Geek. Everyone else didn&#039;t matter to me the side characters that they tried to make important were super unnecessary, especially the brother. <br />
It&#039;s not as bad as other anime I&#039;ve seen and I think the underlying story could have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397579">
        been cool. I think there needed to be more episodes, the ending was blunt and stupid as all heck. I don&#039;t mean the VERY END I mean the whole last episode. Would not recommend this anime unless you are trying to kill time- 12 episodes worth of time. Go take a nap instead.

    Man. I seriously was going to give this a 5/10 but the ending changed my mind.<br />
<br />
The premise and overall plot/general direction and themes of AFTERLOST was quite intriguing. It&#039;s definitely a lot of classic themes surrounding the concepts of morality, mortality and humanity, and especially focusing on the emotion of regret. Where the story progressed was quite interesting enough for me to try to get through all 12 episodes of it.<br />
<br />
However, where the series falls short is also in its plot, because GOD there are so many plot holes in this series. Yes chronologically each episode follows after each in terms of the storytelling, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400759">
        THERE ARE SO MANY PLOT HOLES IN BETWEEN. We get kaboom events that was suddenly introduced in episode Y in which episode X gave no intro to. And the new event in episode Y just goes unexplained. I constantly had to go back a few episodes to see if I missed anything, and to my surprise, I did not.<br />
<br />
The plot overall was also just greedy. Other than supernatural soul beings, soul control, unethical children testing labs for special outlandish abilities, the most boggling concept that they tried to shove in was alternate universe. Yes. They really had to put it in there. It was honestly uncalled for, explained the origin of the events, but it does not serve as an excuse to put it in there. Overall it was just forced.<br />
<br />
The characters are also lackluster, and half of thee time I am unsure of their motivations. If characters go missing by the end of an episode they pretty much just end up not getting an explanation at any case, and both the protagonists are mildly lacking in an interesting personality; the relationship that these two share also don&#039;t make too much of a sense (in terms of motivation once again). Half of the side characters appear in one or two episodes and then never make an appearance again or really get some spotlight for any character depth.<br />
<br />
<br />
I read in a previous review that the show&#039;s biggest problem is execution, and perhaps I do agree with that.<br />
<br />
The ending song features a girl group who disappeared in the LOST event. Means they&#039;ve poofed. And yet they&#039;re still there so that just didn&#039;t make much sense to keep them relevant other than to appeal to the girl group market.
