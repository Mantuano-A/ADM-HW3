    This anime...was very unsettling. This is my first review so be kind. Now let me try and break it down without giving out too much in the way of spoilers.<br />
<br />
1. The Story<br />
<br />
So our uke/sub/bottom, Ren, grew up in Canada and was more or less raised by wolves (???) but unfortunately that&#039;s probably the least ridiculous thing about this anime. The seme/dom/top, Haru, meets him there where he becomes his caretaker and tries to teach him how to live like a civilized human in modern society (Oh the irony, but more on that later). A seven-year timeskip and unnecessarily dramatic plot device later, Ren ends up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222569">
        at Haru&#039;s doorstep as his adopted younger brother.<br />
<br />
Not that there&#039;s anything particularly wrong with this premise as far as shounen-ai goes, but it&#039;s the way the show keeps trying to push the idea of &#039;family&#039; down our throats while the two act as anything but brothers. On the plus side the pacing was fairly decent; once the main setting was established it didn&#039;t feel like anything was being rushed. While some viewers may find it a bit draggy, at least it felt a bit believable.<br />
<br />
Get ready for that usual trope of everyone living in a nice, expensive house, Haru getting cars as presents and actually just getting whatever he wants, money isn&#039;t an issue here.<br />
<br />
- - -<br />
<br />
2. The Pairing<br />
<br />
Why, oh why would anyone be okay with this?! I&#039;ve seen my fair share of uncomfortable anime pairings but this one takes the cake. Throughout the show the pure and noble concept of &#039;brothers&#039; is taken and beaten up and spit upon, then sucker-punched for good measure. I guess what&#039;s scariest about the pairing is how closely Haru resembles a pedophile predator. Every move he makes on Ren is manipulative, creepy, inappropriate and criminal.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s hard to take this show as the light-hearted fluff it presents itself to be, because your main pairing is inherently dark when you think about it. Ren has no idea he&#039;s more or less being groomed by his legal guardian, and the morons who serve as side-characters in this show do nothing to stop it, or even see anything wrong with it for that matter.<br />
<br />
- - -<br />
<br />
3. The Characters<br />
<br />
Which brings us to the third strike for this show. Most of the characters are useless, bumbling idiots. The two women on this show are treated as harsh, dominatrix slave-drivers on permanent PMS, while the girls are either dust-brained Haru fangirls or evil, conniving and wicked. The only girls who&#039;re treated with some grace are those who don&#039;t pose a threat to our main pairing.<br />
<br />
Apart from Haru and Ren, Haru&#039;s younger adopted twin brothers, Shima and Aki, are also important. No, they aren&#039;t actually, it makes no difference whether they exist or not, because they have no real opinions about anything. Shima is your token megane; while after one episode of what looked like interesting family dynamics and a strong characterization for Aki, he was reduced to another Ren fanboy for absolutely no real reason. The two see nothing wrong with their brother sexually imposing himself on a minor, as do most of the others - something is very wrong with everyone in this Lala land of Haru&#039;s fantasies.<br />
<br />
On that note...don&#039;t get me started on Haru. You feel like reaching into the screen and slapping him 9 out of 10 times. Apparently he&#039;s incredibly good-looking, which seems to be why everyone forgives him for the stuff he does, I mean I can&#039;t find any other reason why this criminal is roaming the streets. He acts like a silly, loving, affectionate older brother but I swear it just comes off as CREEPY. He&#039;s so touchy with Ren - any scene involving the two, especially later on, is bile-inducing. I tend to compartmentalize fictional characters separately from real people so that even &#039;evil&#039; characters can find a place on my favourites list, but with Haru...I can&#039;t remember the last time I disliked someone so much. I guess it&#039;s because he gets away with everything he does and no one sees any wrong in him.<br />
<br />
I will say that Ren is a bit of a saving grace for the show. While I didn&#039;t outright like him, he was treated much better than the others as far as his character was written. But throughout he felt like the victim of the sick and perverted Haru.<br />
<br />
- - -<br />
<br />
In conclusion I&#039;ll say that this show does have its strengths, especially for the audience it targets. If you&#039;re into yaoi/shounen-ai then this isn&#039;t a bad choice, there&#039;s plenty of fanservice sprinkled about and it gets heavier as you go ahead. I&#039;m guessing people who enjoy this genre are either used to its cliches or actually enjoy them, so I won&#039;t mention that as a flaw. And while I personally found the pairing distasteful, there are those who might end up liking it. And as much as I hate to admit it, I can see Haru being popular with the younger fujoshi crowd. The music, atmosphere and artwork was also really good, to give credit where it is due. Oh and if you like dogs and canines in general, there&#039;s plenty of that as well.<br />
<br />
On the other hand if you don&#039;t particularly care for yaoi/shounen-ai then don&#039;t bother with this anime, it&#039;ll just get you frustrated and angry. For me the best part about it was that it was only ten episodes long, but the bad news is that a season 2 is in the works. Hopefully it&#039;ll begin with Haru getting sent to prison *fingers crossed*

    This is your classic shounen-ai/yaoi anime and I love it. If you&#039;re not a fan of the genre or are new to it, this may not be the one you should start with. It&#039;s not lightly sprinkled with the yaoi but the core content of the anime is. <br />
This review is biassed as I&#039;m a huge fan of this genre. <br />
<br />
First up, for the yaoi fans, don&#039;t fret, the anime definitely has adorable scenes you won&#039;t regret waiting for. The get slightly more at the end than what you would have noticed at the beginning. Watching the mangas scenes animated on screen was adorable af.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220302">
        <br />
<br />
The story is great. It&#039;s based on the characters Kaidou Haru and Kaidou Ren who are step-brothers who try to find a way to accept their place in a family and their growing feelings for each other. It&#039;s interesting especially as the art, with the multiple and frequent chibis, enhances the comedic aspects of the plot. Some of the important events of the actual plot line do end up rushing by so a complete grasp of the plot cannot be taken. But that&#039;s no complaint as the actual art and the colours of the show make up for it. <br />
<br />
The characters are super relatable, the story mostly does revolve around their very human feelings and their flaws. Despite their classic bishounen and overly appealing features, I would expect most of us to relate to at least a few of their traits. You see an adult, sort of, working to help support his younger brothers and hence get a glimpse of the work aspects and taking care of a family. On the other side, you see our unsociable and slightly stoic Ren get attached to Haru and try to come to terms with this development in his life. The others characters such as the high school twins Aki and Shima are quite strong characters themselves. Haruko is also shown to have a distinct strong personality of her own adding a flavour to the mix in the anime. <br />
<br />
The opening and ending themes are quite catchy too and I personally loved the ending theme. I sat through it every time.<br />
Overall, I loved the anime! Honestly, I expected it to be a longer series. When I updated MAL and it showed that I&#039;ve &#039;completed&#039; the anime. I wasn&#039;t ready for it to end. At all. <br />
For all the veteran yaoi fans, no way you&#039;d miss this so I have nothing to say to you.<br />
For those attempting this genre, you can give it a try and it&#039;s lighthearted enough for you to be able to enjoy it, especially if you love cute romance animes.

    I&#039;m not a fan of these type of anime but i given it a try and honestly its really good.Its boy on boy instead of usual boy on girl but everything is really good.The art is great,the story is really good and we have a season 2 announced to start airing in January 2017.The characters are awesome and there is a lot of development through out the episodes.All in all i really enjoyed this anime and i recommend you to watch it too.I give it overall 8,it would be 9 but for me 10 episodes is simply to little but its great and worth of

    Speaking of the anime, I enjoyed it. Yes, the age difference between Ren and Haru did make me uncomfortable, and I wished Haru would have been younger (or Ren be older) but then my mind wandered to the blatant display of the nipples of 14 year old in the ecchi anime that I’ve watched (ya know, the kinda content that the haters of this show are totes okay with), and then I was completely okay with this relationship. I liked the character development of all the characters, especially the growing bond between Ren and Haru. I also liked how the twins warmed up to Ren,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242848">
        as well as people’s reaction to finding out Haru’s intention towards Ren. Haha! Those were some genuine reactions, right there.<br />
<br />
I liked the twins, especially Aki&#039;s feelings towards Ren and how they progress throughout the series. I also loved it when the two called out Haru on his intentions and actions - watching Haru left red faced was truly hilarious. I laughed when I should have, and smiled when I should have. The music’s good – it complements the series nicely as well. The art’s alright; nothing good, nothing bad. It did seem jarring to me when the art form became chibi (?) during funny scenes, because it completely took away from the seriousness of the situation, especially when Ren and Haru were having their moments.<br />
<br />
The only thing that befuddled me is to why Haru took such a strong liking to Ren. I mean, he’s tall, good looking and an obviously charismatic dude with no scarcity of men or women – so why Ren? Apart from finding him “kawaii”, I didn’t find much reason for Haru’s dependency and feelings for Ren. The inclusion of Natsuo seemed pointless to me, but whatever. Who cares? It’s made for fans and it did great fan service – much better than I expected, to be honest. Without, you know, sexualizing a minor. If you’re into BL/yaoi then you’re sure to enjoy this series.<br />
<br />
PS. If you&#039;re chill with shipping Eren and Mikasa (adopted siblings), then you should be cool shipping Ren and Haru. Chill tf out, peeps.<br />

    This is honestly so disgusting that this has TWO seasons the <br />
age gap is like really uncomfortable. This is really gross and disturbing so please read reviews first and the people who made this are literally just weirdoes.<br />
<br />
Plus THEY ARE ADOPTED BROTHERS if you actually enjoy this you need some help like no seriously the 28 yr old fell in love with his ADOPTED BROTHER that is literally like TEN.<br />
 <br />
My point is, do not watch this this is really disturbing.<br />
Like please get a mental therapist if you enjoy this. <br />
<br />
Yeah hope this review helped and convinced you NOT TO WATCH SUPER LOVERS EVER IN

    This is my first review, sorry if I make any mistakes.<br />
<br />
The good things about Super Lovers is that it had good animation and the music was pretty good. That&#039;s about it.<br />
<br />
The story made no sense at all. It was rushed and the back stories didn&#039;t make sense.<br />
<br />
 The characters were bland and not much fun. I liked Ren, however, Haru is creepy (which I&#039;ll get to). You really didn&#039;t even need the brothers. <br />
<br />
Here&#039;s what bothered me: Super Lovers tries to appear as a light-hearted anime when in reality, it&#039;s actually really dark.<br />
<br />
The most concerning thing to me was the pairing. It&#039;s borderline pedophilia. Ren

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226234">
        is 16 but looks like he&#039;s about 11 or 12. As shown in the anime, he had no knowledge whatsoever about sex and was shown to be immature for his age. Haru was basically grooming and manipulating him. Not to mention — they&#039;re adopted brothers! Come on, shouldn&#039;t your immature (physically and mentally), adopted brother that&#039;s 8 years younger than you be off limits? No one in the anime seems to care at all. Haru is a manipulative, creepy pedophile. <br />
<br />
Overall, I really wanted to like this anime but I just couldn&#039;t. It left me feeling gross and creeped out. I don&#039;t recommend it.<br />

    Honestly horrible..<br />
<br />
Haru is really creepy and there is a lot of pedophilic behavior in this anime. Child grooming is not okay. <br />
I have never written a review before but after watching a few episodes of this, i needed to get my thoughts out. its a pathetic excuse of BL, at least make the characters CLOSE to the same age if its going to be a love story. Ren was eight, so it’s not okay.<br />
<br />
I dislike this because although the art is okay, and the voice acting is good, its such a waste to put this on a child grooming type anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    If I had a dollar for everytime a terrible yaoi anime came out, I would have enough money to buy a noose to hang myself with.<br />
<br />
Now that we&#039;ve gotten that quality introduction out of the way, where I do I even begin with this terrible mess of an anime? <br />
<br />
The premise, ah yes.<br />
Our smol protagonist, Ren, lives out in Canada where he was &quot;raised by wolves&quot;.<br />
Yes, that makes complete sense. <br />
Next thing you know, he&#039;s at the doorstep of Haru&#039;s house, where he was adopted by his family.<br />
Adopted, which means even though they&#039;re not related, they sorta still are.<br />
7-8 years later, a major time-skip this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261681">
        anime makes, Ren is now a teen, and Haru is a fully-grown adult.<br />
Typical yaoi tropes, begin! Haru, an adult, yes, realizes he has feelings for Ren when he&#039;s underage (from a Japan perspective). Kissing him straight on the lips, for &quot;affection&quot;.<br />
When he&#039;s a teen those &quot;feelings&quot; are more obvious for Ren, and the disaster ensues. <br />
<br />
Pardon me, let me just grab my bleach, gun, noose, yes.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk about the characters.<br />
<br />
Ren, is a teen, underage, and being sought-out by his older brother who is an adult. He&#039;s the cold, tsundere, yet sorta-affectionate-not-really-but-just-for-the-sake-of-yaoi character. <br />
He gives into Haru&#039;s desires, and I say resist, child!<br />
Nothing interesting about him, honestly.<br />
<br />
Haru, the pedophile. The weird love-interest character that just wants to get in his lil&#039; brother&#039;s pants. And the eye-candy for 12 year-olds to swoon and get off too. <br />
Those bright emerald eyes will stare into the deepest depths of your soul. <br />
Someone arrest this man already.<br />
<br />
Any female character is designed as a horrible character and is bashed, because yaoi. <br />
<br />
I think there are other characters, but they&#039;re probably not important. When are side-characters ever important in yaoi?<br />
<br />
Additional ranting.<br />
Remember, Haru&#039;s in his mid-20&#039;s, and Ren is what, 15? Yeaah, not weird at all.<br />
Not to mention every male character in this show is gay, once again, because yaoi.<br />
That includes Haru&#039;s brothers, and other random male characters that this show may present. <br />
The plot in itself is confusing, and luckily I didn&#039;t watch enough of it in an attempt to understand it. <br />
<br />
<br />
The animation is decent at the very least, better than other yaoi anime I&#039;ve seen.<br />
Nothing spectacular though. Same goes for the OST, OP/ED, they&#039;re not good whatsoever. The OST is mediocre.<br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR:<br />
-pedophilia<br />
-big bro wants to bang lil&#039; bro<br />
-for 12 year-old lonely girls and under <br />
-meh animation/ost<br />
-i want to kill myself<br />
-donate bleach to my patreon <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
Sound: 3/10<br />
Character: 1/10<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
Overall: 2/10<br />

    My review for this would be so long so I&#039;m a just cut it down from pages and pages to a few paragraphs. <br />
<br />
Super Lovers, the most controversial thing out there right now is one of my most favorite series. I&#039;ve been delaying on making this review because I&#039;ve been writing my own thoughts in essay format for my own personal enjoyment. Anyway, this is a boys love series, this is labeled with shounen-ai themes and homosexual relations. If you are not a fan or are squeaked out by even the mere sight of light same sex relationships in anime/manga then I suggest not giving

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233196">
        this episode a try. You will not like it at all. My reason for making this a crucial point in this paragraph is because the comments and reviews I&#039;ve seen both on MAL and on other anime sites are written by non-bl fans so you can just imagine how biased and narrow-minded some of the comments are. If you&#039;re a fan of bl but not shounen-ai or age gaps then once again, I suggest skipping this anime and moving on with your anime lifestyle. <br />
<br />
When it comes down to the controversial aspects, I&#039;ll cut it down to the two major issues people seem to have with this series. The age gap is the most primary complaint. Ren and Haru have a 8-9 year age gap yet people are mistaken for when the relationship between Ren and Haru start. Haru meets Ren when he is just an eight year old boy and Haru is 16 years old himself. That&#039;s the premise for episode one, chapter one. Haru sees Ren as a little brother, someone who his mother forces him to take care of over summer break and Haru, being the caring teen he is, decides to brave the storm and lend his mother a hand. Eventually, Haru has to leave and go back to Japan so he makes a promise with Ren about them living together in the future. He wants someone to baby, someone who he can cook for and look after. This episode was cute as it emphasized Haru&#039;s worrywart self and Ren&#039;s stoic personality.<br />
<br />
People seem to have a problem with Haru&#039;s kiss on Ren&#039;s lips in episode one but I fail so see why everyone is so up in arms? Haru is a foreigner, he stated (in the manga and later on in the anime) that Aki and Shima (his step siblings) told him to cut it out because it was embarrassing since they grew out of his brotherly affection. A pretty normal occurrence and reaction for siblings. Ren responds by punching him and saying how it&#039;s not normal for him. So, Haru listens and resorts to giving him a peck on the forehead to which Ren doesn&#039;t argue against. Nothing is particularly wrong or &quot;controversial&quot; in episode one. I mean, Alex from Kuroko no Basuke kissed everyone on the lips, even though it made people uncomfortable within the show, viewers had no issue whatsoever. Anyhow, there&#039;s multiple time skips and if you pay close attention, you&#039;ll see that the platonic love (on Haru&#039;s side) turns into a romantic one once Ren turns 15 and makes it clear that he&#039;s in love with Haru. However, his first confession was when he was 13 but since Abe decided to make Haru into such a dense character, he didn&#039;t really process the information and only did what he could to make Ren happy, which was go after him when he moved back to Canada and after lots of unsuccessful attempts, they move back to Japan. Ren is 15 when it happens so he&#039;s not a child anymore but he&#039;s a freshman in high school. <br />
<br />
The second major issue with viewers is the supposed incest. Pseudo incest if you wanna be technical. However, Ren and Haru are only siblings on the family registry. This is because of what happens in episode 3 but basically, Haru and Ren never knew they&#039;d be siblings five years later and Ren never ever sees Haru as an older sibling. He makes it explicitly clear to both Juuzen (a student he befriends at his new school) and even adults (like Takamura-sensei) that him and Haru are not brothers because Ren has fallen for him and thus just can not see him as anything but a lover. This is where the viewer&#039;s personal opinions come into play because if Ren does not want to be seen as Haru&#039;s brother then who are we (and the other characters of course) to tell Ren what he can and can not say or think. There is a point later on where Ren and Haru talk about the siblings thing but pretty much come to an agreement on the subject. <br />
<br />
The last thing I want to comment on is how some viewers and well, complainers for lack of better word, seem to say how Ren is too young and Haru is too old cause he&#039;s 23/4 while Ren is 15/6 but I think they&#039;re missing a crucial point in Ren&#039;s mental abilities. Ren at a very young age was home-schooled, taught multiple foreign languages, and even learned enough math, English, and other studies that he&#039;s basically on equal footing with college students. I think people have an issue with the age of consent laws more so than Ren&#039;s own well developed choices and decisions. Haru makes a comment about how Ren can not skip grades in Japan so he has to deal with taking easy classes until he graduates. Ren was taught by Harvard graduates when he was a child so it&#039;s really unlikely for him to still think and act like a naive kid. He&#039;s pretty clueless when it comes to emotional thoughts but he isn&#039;t a defenseless child that some reviewers seem to imagine him as. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I like the series because Abe managed to take such...&quot;taboo&quot; and problematic elements of the fictional world and combine a few to make such a detailed well developed story. The manga is indefinitely better than the anime. Shoving 60+ pages worth of large amounts of text and art just can not be compressed accurately in a 23 minute episode. That&#039;s what the anime tried to do, compress these chapters into these small episodes so details are often overlooked and well, it made the anime awkward in some parts. The story was told wonderfully but I have to admit, it can get wonky and confusing unless you read the manga. Still, I gave the story a 10 only because the blend of all these different tropes make for an interesting plot. There&#039;s a TON of comedy so you&#039;ll be laughing at the most stupidest things! The soundtrack wasn&#039;t anything too wild or crazy but it was pretty...Exotic since it was mostly country. It gave me that nice slice of life feel. The characters, they feel relatable, some more so than others but my major complaint is the lack of screen time for the side characters and timing felt a bit off when it transitioned between the main couple and others&#039; problems. Still, I give Studio Deen props for including more issues and such of the other characters rather than just focusing on the fanservice that some studios cater towards nowadays. Overall, I rate it a nine! If I had chosen to only watch the anime, my rank could have possibly been lower but the manga made me understand more and did a real good job of keeping me on my toes! I&#039;m not even a fan of yaoi/bl/shounen-ai so this series was an honest surprise for me! It did not fit into any of my preferred tastes. <br />
<br />
In the end, if you&#039;re an open-minded individual who does not care for trivial matters in fiction such as age, relations, and such then I say give Super Lovers a chance! The art is pretty too, the studio makes the scenery stand out more so than the characters sometimes ahaha. This probably isn&#039;t the best of reviews but I just wanted to calm down new viewers nerves before they get into something they dislike and end up hating that thing forever. <br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />

    Ah, the classic I groom a child and it&#039;s a very cute romance. I like it!<br />
<br />
For everyone praising and loved it, the &#039;&#039;seme&#039;&#039; character is a child predator, you know that right? He&#039;s grooming the kid ya know what that is right? That is not particularly cute, you realize that? No? <br />
<br />
Then picture this:<br />
 A little girl that is &#039;&#039;raised by wolves&#039;&#039; and not particularly taken care of by her legal guardian, to the point of her being violent to anyone. Then she meets with a very adult male and he gets to take care of her and starts a blooming romance, being flirted with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314943">
        and sensually touched by the guy that should acting as her parent. Not send to child services. Not to a professional child psychologist. Just with this random guy that she met recently.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong here? Is that what you would want your child or yourself having to go through? It is? Then maybe don&#039;t get kids. Now go read/watch better BL mangas/animes that doesn&#039;t show a glamourized and normalized pedophile relationship. Yes, the kid is almost an adult now. But no, it is still not okay.<br />
<br />
You do see it now? Well thank god, it is good you could realize that. Now go read/watch better BL mangas/animes that doesn&#039;t show a glamourized and normalized pedophile relationship. Yes, the kid is almost an adult now. But no, it is still not okay.<br />
<br />
<br />
For everyone else:<br />
A very good tale of child abuse, not doubt about it. It is creepy, and a good anime on how NOT to make a kid-adult relationship. But it&#039;s not in the tags or genre soooo... not a good show at all, and especially NOT a good cutesy romance. <br />
It&#039;s a dark dark story of child grooming, manipulation and neglect parading as a cute Adult-Teen romance. Nothing less, nothing more.<br />
<br />
Watch it with this in mind, or don&#039;t. And don&#039;t support it, watch it for free at the very least. <br />
<br />
Oh, and I hate the &#039;&#039;uke&#039;&#039;&#039;s proportions, creepy af.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: 2/10 for the sound design and general animation quality. These are the only good things about it.

    Animation: Not my cup of tea, but bearable. It had high quality and the animation movements were non out of the ordinary. <br />
<br />
Soundtrack, OP, ED: It was average.<br />
<br />
Pacing: Average.<br />
<br />
Characters: They aren&#039;t actually that many characters when you think about it, it was the family, the few friends and background characters that aren&#039;t relevant at all. Despite such a small cast, the story carried out quiet well. <br />
<br />
Story: No.<br />
<br />
First ever anime I had to rate a 1.<br />
<br />
When I first started to get into BL, this was one of the few shows that were recommended. After I finished Junjou Romantica, I jumped straight into this show, blindly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361739">
        if I may add. Few episodes in and I wasn&#039;t that invested at all. As episodes continued on I was just bored and mildly disgusted because of the circumstances of the couple in the show. An adult and a minor, who are legally siblings. But nevertheless I watched the whole 2 seasons for the sake of watching a BL anime since there were barely any BL shows at the time. Bad decision really.<br />
<br />
The only problem I have with this show is the couple. It this wasn&#039;t a BL and just a normal slice of life, I would&#039;ve enjoyed it. <br />
<br />
First of all, the couple consist of an adult and a minor, which I don&#039;t need to explain why that is wrong. But then there&#039;s &quot;In Japan, the age of consent is 13, so their relationship is acceptable.&quot; Sweetie, sorry to break it to you but you need to research your facts correctly. Yes when you search age of consent in Japan it will say 13, but also, an adult in Japan is not allowed to engage in any sort of relationship with a minor, or they can go to jail whether or not the minor gave consent. Keep in mind, MINORS CANNOT GIVE CONSENT. <br />
<br />
In the show, they don&#039;t have s€x, BUT the amount of times the adult touched him extremely s€xually it just made me gag. Eg, touching his privates, caressing various parts of his body and kissing him?? Sir are you aware you are m0l€st1ing a child who cannot give consent to your actions?<br />
<br />
Secondly, brothers. &quot;But they&#039;re not blood related!&quot; yeah, and the author totally did not agree for having a thing for !nc€st. I&#039;m not k1nk shaming or anything, but I just pointed it out since the couple got other bull$h1t going on with them along with this too. <br />
<br />
If you enjoyed this couple and genuinely ship it, stay away from me. I don&#039;t even want to breath the same air as you.<br />
<br />
<br />

    In my view nothing felt rushed at all, I really enjoyed the show and all it had to offer!!! I can&#039;t wait till season two and I hope you give it a try and find out for yourself how much you like it!! I loved it!!!  <br />
One of the main chars, Ren grows up as the story progresses and I love films like that! You start to understand his quirks and likes, and the story bored show off his whole character in a school setting, intimate, as well as open with people, he is not shy towards. <br />
I don&#039;t want to ruin to much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224345">
        of the story in this review but honestly I really did love it, I couldn&#039;t really find an outstanding flaw that would stop most people that enjoy this anime to turn it down!!

    Now that i have watched  all this season of Super Lovers i can safely put this up there with best animes ive seen and ive saw alot of them(Dont check my list i only started using the site recently). Ill give a somewhat detailed rundown as to why this anime is great without spoiling anything.<br />
<br />
Story.(10/10) <br />
From episode 1 to this anime has it highs and lows for the Main Characters Ren and Haru and at several points the show made me sad for the characters and thats something that the vast majority of shows cant do but in contrast to that the show has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308809">
        many moments that make me smile and laugh which shows you how well written it is. Withoout going into any spoilers i can safely say you will enjoy the story even if you dont like Shounen Ai  anime. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound(10/10)  <br />
Not much to say hear both the music and the voice acting and other sounds are done outstandingly. Only one issue here but its more a personal one and doesn&#039;t take a way from the 10/10 score and that that with my eyesight issues reading subtitles is very hard and therefore id love the chance to rewatch the show in English at some point. <br />
Characters(10/10)<br />
All  of the characters are great and seem overall like believable people. The anime primarily focuses on the Main 2 characters Ren and Haru. Ren is  my favourite character in the anime by a large margin however as i find his personality very similar to my own as he seems very much like the kind of peroson who is smart and honest but straight forward and he hates crowds whcich i can understand as well all as his sometimes lack in social skills which i also have at times. The other characters are also great but Ren stands out to me the most . <br />
Art(10/10)<br />
The art for this anime is beautiful and the characters are very cute and well drawn as well as the backgounds and objects , small details etc .  Not much more to say here.<br />
Overall(10/10)<br />
Overall the anime is  pretty much perfect except for the fact there isnt enough of it and i wish it was englsish  so  one request is that the creators make a third season and please dub the anime :)  Hope my review helped

    This anime is blatantly pedophilia. In addition, they did not make the characters as siblings to avoid incest, but the relationship between them is basically based on a big brother-little brother relationship. The older one&#039;s interest in the other begins when the other is still a child. Totally disgusting. The child then becomes a highschool student and is still a child. The man is much older than him. I also remember the man trying to kiss and touch him even though he didn&#039;t want to. This is blatant harassment. Why don&#039;t people react negatively to this anime? I&#039;ve seen people who like this anime make

    Wow this anime is the best thing I can ever come across - EVER. I highly recommend to all yaoi fans, it&#039;s super cute, romantic and has it&#039;s steamy moments. It&#039;s not weird at all as some people may think considering the main Characters relationship but it&#039;s not. It&#039;s very light-hearted and comedic as well, their gags are absolutely hilarious and their little emotional moments will tug at your heart strings. YOU WILL NOT regret watching this anime, it&#039;s so amazing I really wish they could just release so many more episodes all at once because it&#039;s like I can&#039;t get enough of all the

    In short : ‘For people into young/old people relationships. Who doesn’t mind what is considered as incest in some countries.’<br />
<br />
PS : Yes, the law regarding adopted children varies from one country to another, some perceive it as incest, some don’t – just pointing out since I’ve seen both sides being claimed as some sort of absolute truth – in case of Japanese law, it isn’t considered as incest, so the product itself isn’t incest, but it is perfectly normal that for inhabitants of other countries it is perceived as such.<br />
<br />
PPS : No, the rating has nothing to do with it being male on male or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242072">
        young/old, I was fully aware what I was getting into from the title to the poster to the synopsis ; my reason for trying it out was because I was positively surprised to see such an Anime with such a high rating on MAL, so I was really curious to try it out. You’re curious to know why then ? Welp, let’s keep it short, shall we ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Art :<br />
<br />
First of all, let’s start with the only quality of this show : its art. The art is consistent for the most part, except episodes 8 and 9 where there’s a perceptible drop, but it is never dramatic. One complaint I’d formulate, though, is the overuse of “sparkles” or “stars” to emphasis the “prettiness” of a scene, it’s so used it becomes funny after a while. Overusing anything tends to have that effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Soundtrack :<br />
<br />
While it isn’t bad, there’s one soundtrack for one tone and with a constant tone shift, you end up hearing the same soundtracks several times per episodes, to the point it can sound redundant and lose all its charm, or even become tiring.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters :<br />
<br />
With only 10 episodes and the show being closer to a resume of the manga rather than a proper show, most characters remain stereotyped and aren’t particularly explored. They may have more or less strong traits, but it never goes further. The same can be stated for the two protagonists. While it is obvious they are supposed to evolve over the years, the nature of the show makes it rather hard. While there’s no distinct evolution regarding Haru, Ren gets through slight changes, but it is hard to pin point a proper process with the writing constantly jumping from one thing to another and its numerous ellipses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story :<br />
<br />
When the first episode of a show feels like the equivalent of an entire season, you can already foresee that the rest of the show will be a marathon in terms of pacing. And that’s not a compliment. I understand 10 episodes isn’t much and they wanted to cover as much of the manga as possible – apparently the pacing is slower and it takes time to develop its elements – but a show isn’t supposed to be a resume of another medium, it has to stand as its own. <br />
<br />
The plot points are so quick one after the other, the ellipses so numerous, that there’s little time left for elements to sink in and the tone shifts are so severe you go from one extreme to another and the positive as the negative feel overdone. (and here I speak of the story, not a character being overdramatic, which is fundamentally different) Good writing consists of ups and downs, yes, but repeatedly being on the extreme and too close to one or another is misunderstanding that basic concept.<br />
<br />
Lastly – yes, I did say I’d keep it short – but the last episode is problematic. Its cliffhanger is immediately shattered by the aftercredits. ….Do the people who wrote this know how a cliffhanger works ? Hahaha, there was 0 reason for the narrative closure to feature that element if it’s broken in an epilogue (it’s too consequent to call it a simple extra). ^^’<br />
<br />
<br />
Entertainment :<br />
<br />
I was amused at times, though, since it’s a theme that makes me uncomfortable outside pornography I was more than once off-put, especially in the forelast episode. I liked most characters, though considering the way females are portrayed more than once I question the unwanted potential reading that can be done. Well, at least I hope it’s unwanted.<br />
<br />
On the same unwantedness…Haru’s attitude which can very easily be perceived as...abusive. No, I don’t think it was the aim of the show, I think it wanted to be fun, lighthearted and cute with “sometimes” a bit of drama, but the way he acted and made Ren believe his actions are normal, kept repeating them and pushed himself on him (metaphorically and literally) is….er, let’s just say that such a situation IRL would lead Haru in prison and that the kid or teenager would be taken in charge by a psychologist for probably a few years. Anything but a funny or positive situation. And that thought – while I knew this is a fiction not taking this consideration at all, backed up by the fact in the end of the day no one ever thinks of it as damaging for Ren – always lured in the back of my mind. Now, of course, it’s just this theme that I have issues with, it doesn’t mean others have to have it and I don’t mind all those not having it, after all there are other themes who don’t bother me at all, some form of incest, for example, when it’d bother others. To each their own, and as long as the difference between reality and fiction is kept, there’s no issue to withhold.

    I Like this anime because it was so funny that made me laugh and it was so good I watch this anime more than two times. What I dislike was that it needed more episode to complete this but the whole thing was a ok ending that what I guess well.<br />
When I watched this anime because it only came on Wednesday and I had to wait a week and about 3:00 pm to come out each episode each week but the anime is really good to watch I recommend this anime to watch.<br />
This anime was the best anime that I watch this month that made

    Super Lovers is a slow paced romance story that steers into the incest genre if one wants to interpet it that way. The main character Haru and Ren are not blood related, but are expected to treat each other like brothers and might not completely understand the definition which makes for flirty scenes.<br />
<br />
Other than romance the story focusses on Ren&#039;s past life and gradually explains to you, the viewer, what caused him to be the way he is. His distachment and misunderstanding of the world is not overly done and explained throughout the story. Yet there are several cliché parts in the series, such as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220356">
        Ren not understanding the reactions of his own body, the friends and family members of the two brothers hardly think badly of them for behaving overly flirty with other other even though they are supposedly related, not to mention males and of very different ages, that may be true elements in a teenager&#039;s life, but not in a gay community. It is great that everyone (albeit not openly supportive, but) is accepting of them, but most turn a blind eye to Haru&#039;s obvious attempt to get touchy-feely with a boy that should not match his age. The side characters however are enjoyable and more realistic about the entire set-up which is pleasant to see.<br />
<br />
In my opinion this series only got interesting at episode 07 where conflict between Haru and Ren about their current relationship and what they actually should be is brought to a climax with truthful, but hurtful words. After that there is far more development for both characters. Especially Ren comprehends that at his age his hormones are active and bring changes to his body and his reactions to Haru&#039;s endearments that have not changed from the very beginning but suddenly spark something desirable in Ren.<br />
<br />
For those among us who wish to experience a bit more intimacy, I recommend watching episode 09 over and over. It is subtle and there are no explicit images shown, but the dialogue and setting of the scene makes for the very first sexual experience between Haru and Ren. How exciting this may be, it is only one episode away from the end, which was rather dissatisying, because only just recently did the two of them get to explore the levels of their relationship and suddenly it is announced by Haruko that the two of them will be separated. This is, of course, against their will, and promises more interesting conflict in the near future, but for me personally it felt like going back to episode 01 and not having acchieved anything by watching the 10 episodes in total. I sincerely hope season 02 proves me wrong.<br />
<br />
All in all I give this series a 6/10. The story was intriguing enough to keep my attention and make me come back for more. However, I prefer the theme of homosexuality, incest and the fact that there&#039;s quite the age difference to be more realistic when it comes to being in a relationship with such elements and how the environment with family and friends respond. This was a romantic and dramatic season with lovely scenes of endearment between two people who obvioulsy care a lot about each other. So far it was an imagine of what we hope for them to happen, not so much what would actually happen.

    Never really thought i would write a review for this godforsaken series. But boredom has got to me. Also, as i have watched super lovers a good 2+ years ago my memory may be a little murky.<br />
<br />
  Super lovers is what you&#039;d call a shounen-ai, a genre that has very pedophilic roots. <br />
   <br />
  In super lovers we get to see a grown ass man groom his little brother while everybody watches and doesn&#039;t say shit. I think what i find most disgusting is that everybody in that series knows it&#039;s wrong but doesn&#039;t do anything to help ren get away

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370807">
        from his disgusting older brother. <br />
<br />
  Now the other thing that&#039;s so utterly strange about super lovers is the entertainment, yes all the characters were dogshit, if not worse that that. But I somehow managed to blast through those episodes so quickly, it&#039;s kinda shocking.<br />
<br />
  Onto the art, there isn&#039;t really much to say about it except the fact that occasionally throughout the series, (from what i can remember) the art got nicer. Either way it&#039;s a waste of talent overall considering how shitty this series is.<br />
<br />
Overall this series could&#039;ve been at least a tad better if the 2 weren&#039;t literally brothers and 8 years apart. <br />
<br />
Well that&#039;s the end of my small rant that i will call a &quot;review&quot;, also sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes.<br />
<br />

    I’ll be honest, I insta dropped this show after the first episode in my first viewing. BUT I decided to give it another go after hearing that it was pretty decent. <br />
<br />
And just to make it clear, I’m completely against incest and pedophilia which is why I first dropped this series but then again it’s just fiction so no one is really being hurt (the again you could argue that it makes victims of such exploitation look like a joke but that’s whole other can of worms). <br />
<br />
This show had some gushable scenes in it but were kinda ruined with them pushing the whole brothers

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370535">
        bullshit in our faces constantly. And according to literally all the dumbass adults in this show the magic words “not related by blood” just makes everything okay for some reason while ignoring the significant age gap between Ren and Haru. That was big oof to me ngl especially the scenes where Haru LITERALLY grooms Ren into starting to want Haru to touch him and kiss him more.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the story is pretty forgettable tbh the only scenes that actually stirred the plot was Ren leaving to Canada but that got resolved real fast and everything was fine and dandy afterwards I guess.<br />
<br />
The art was nothing special really, but it was decent.<br />
<br />
The music, well I don’t remember any of it. Mainly because I skipped the op and ed almost every time since they were pretty boring to sit through.<br />
<br />
The characters.... well I enjoyed the twins the most probably in the show not that remember them by name, most of the side cast was pretty lackluster. <br />
<br />
My enjoyment.. uhhh I hate to admit it but I did binge both seasons in a day, and putting all the bad shit aside, it was pretty amusing to see all the chaos between Ren and Haru unfold. Like watching a train wreck tbh.<br />
<br />
Overall I’m rating it a 4.5, because I did enjoy the show to an extent but I can’t fuck with anything that it stands for. I just hope that future Yaoi can provide me with consenting adults that aren’t related next time to enjoy.<br />
<br />
