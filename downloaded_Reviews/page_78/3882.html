Our orange haired girl loves a boy, Touji (who according to her &quot;sources&quot; hates tans and bleached hair) and has a psychotic best friend with sociopath tendencies who makes her life as complicated as she possibly can. It doesn’t end there though, there’s also Kairi, the popular guy in school who adds him wisdom and pervertness to the show and gives us a few laughs  in between, because he’s the only one that gives any sort of humor in this one. Talk about a tough load to carry.<br />
I think the whole plot in this anime revolves around the fact that Momo is tanned and has bleached hair, so take that way and you’ve got nothing at all original. At all.<br />
<br />
Momo is actually an ok lead girl, she stands up for herself and aside from her questionable taste in guy’s, I think she has potential.  Though watching the back and forth she had going made me wonder if she felt like she was time traveling in her own life to try and  change how things turned out. That’s a better story then she just couldn’t make up her mind.  I think she got the short end of the stick seeing as she isn’t the only swimmer but she’s the only one with bleached hair and tanned skin.<br />
<br />
Sae has serious self esteem issues.  She is infuriating to watch and at some points I wish someone would beat her. Not to death of course because then they wouldn’t be able to beat her again.  She is the worst friend anyone could ever have. Well maybe not the worst since she never actually killed anyone. Fine, worst shy of murder. “That filthy mouth of yours spills out venom like nobody’s business.” That&#039;s our Sae.  But thanks to her Momo sees what type of people are actually around her.<br />
<br />
Touji, oh Touji, it’s too bad you didn’t have a brain in that head of yours, you could have done great things. It’s not his fault though, he’s just a gullible, nice guy who believes anyone but his girlfriend. His role was horrible and anyone would have looked like an ignoramus on it, through it, around it. You get what I mean.<br />
<br />
Kairi is the glass half full of the show, most of the time. He’s what make the last half more or less watchable. Guy with a questionable past and undefined future. He&#039;s the comfort and the pain but he&#039;s the only one that sees through Sae&#039;s facade. Making him the smartest person in a dumb class.<br />
<br />
The animation was average to below average. The characters looks stiff and sometimes act that way too, very two dimensional. I found it hard to get into because the dudes look like chicks, but you get used to it and eventually move on. The sceneries aren&#039;t memorable and I have definitely seen better, just look at Clannad. Oh how I miss thee...<br />
The soundtrack is below average, with the same music being repeated throughout various scenes in the episodes. The OP is catchy but even that loses it’s charm.  The ED is much better, maybe because it’s less upbeat and more harmonized. The English voice adaptation makes Touji sound like he&#039; high sometimes because of his inability to show emotion in his voice. That&#039;s harsh I know but still. Sae&#039;s voice if on for more than five minutes at a time will cause your ears to bleed. Hmm, they didn&#039;t put that in the label. Other voices were fitting and not too bland or out there.<br />
<br />
Had the show been better I probably would have picked up the manga for it. My mind couldn’t take anymore Momo+Touji+Sae+Kairi idealistic drama.<br />
Sometimes I think this one should have been called, “Lets Break Up So We Can Get Back Together?” I’m not exactly sure what kept me watching then. Or what drew me in to re-watch the ending years after. Maybe it&#039;s because in the end the right guy gets the girl, the guy you liked or wanted to get the girl all along. It’s not because of the (unoriginal) plot or character development, since most of them don’t grow and actually become selfish and immature as time passes. There&#039;s something that keeps you interested to see WTF will happen next. Either way, my rating from back then and the rating now are much different, after I have watched many more anime.<br />
<br />
Oh Momo, when will you learn.<br />

    Peach Girl is a high school love triangle (square?) story that probably wouldn&#039;t surprise most people.  It&#039;s enjoyable enough if you like the genre anyway, so I&#039;d suggest it to people who like this sort of thing but I wouldn&#039;t say you&#039;d have to rush out to get your hands on it.  <br />
<br />
I kept on being reminded of Bokura Ga Ita as I watched this.  They&#039;re similar type stories in a way; especially in the main conflict of the heroine and the two men in her life (and also some plot points, frankly).  I think the overall quality of Bokura Ga

          <span style="display: none;" id="review925">
        Ita was better than Peach Girl, but I thought that the heroine in Peach Girl, Momo-chan, was a lot more likeable than Nana (she *reallly* annoyed me in the second half of BGI).<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The first thing that comes to mind is that the pacing of the story is a little odd in my opinion.  Sometimes it feels like all this time passes by in a blink of an eye and sometimes it&#039;s just plain slow.  Aside from that, you&#039;ve got a pretty sweet -- if convoluted -- story about love, indecision, strength and trust.  And what it means to be in a relationship with someone else and how and why we choose the people we do.  Sometimes things get over the top, but that&#039;s more of a character issue (see below). <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art is generally nice.  The two men in Momo&#039;s life, Touji and Kairi, made me think of Yamato Nadeshiko Shichi Henge -- I think because of the heavily-lashed eyes.  It&#039;s also slightly reminiscent of YNSH in the frequent use of SD versions of the characters.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Kairi&#039;s voiced by Kenichi Suzumura.  I LOVE him.  All the actors of the main four characters do a good job, but...  Suzumura is tops. =)  Saeko Chiba also deserves props for doing a good job of making a character who could have been overly mewling and annoying into a likeable person, despite all the tears.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
I thought they did a nice job of making the conflict here.  You can see where Momo comes from and you can see why Touji and Kairi are both so compelling and appealling to her.  I was definitely rooting for one over the other, but that&#039;s probably more about my own taste. ;)  The character I probably had the most problem with was Sae -- I mean, we&#039;re not supposed to like her anyway, but it might have been nice to have a better idea why she was the way she was... especially since she was SO over the top and extreme as a character.  I didn&#039;t like her AT ALL, which made her hard to watch -- if there was something -- anything -- that made me at least sympathize with her, it would have been more interesting, I think.  At the same time, a critical viewer could say that all of the characters are somewhat... shallow and under-developed compared to the very best of the romance/slice-of-life type dramas like Honey &amp;amp; Clover.  They just are... and there&#039;s not much explanation why outside of Momo.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I liked it, it was okay.  I think the parts I liked made up for the parts that I thought were a little lacking overall.  I liked Kairi&#039;s character and it kept me interested for the most part.  If you&#039;re looking for a sweet romance and you&#039;ve worked your way through the great ones already, this is nice.  If you&#039;re looking for something really fantastic and haven&#039;t seen much, I&#039;d go through Honey &amp;amp; Clover, Nodame Cantabile, Nana, Ouran High School Host Club, and Lovely Complex first, at the very least.

25 episodes of the anime seen<br />

<br />
My notes &amp;amp; Opinion on this anime <br />
[This portion is meant for people who don&#039;t want to read the whole review.] <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re into high school comedy romance, Peach Girl should be on your &amp;quot;plan to watch&amp;quot; list. But this anime is one of those love it or hate it anime. You either REALLY love the drama that goes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5115">
        on, the characters, and the conflicts. Or you seriously hate how unrealistic, annoying, and overly dramatic it can be. <br />
<br />
This anime was EXTREMELY hard for me to score because there are times when I thought this anime was very poorly written, unrealistic, and had annoying characters. But other times, it completely turns around and I end up loving the anime! There are MANY elements in this anime that make it both strong, and weak. I predicted I&#039;d hate this anime, but I ended up becoming addicted to Peach Girl. This isn&#039;t the most amazing anime I&#039;ve seen, but it caught me and left me in tears. That&#039;s why I give this anime an 8<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
The Good: There are a lot of love triangles going on in this anime. Momo x Touji, Toji x Sae, Momo x Kairi, Kairi x Misao, etc... <br />
When the anime is focusing on Momo and the two guys she&#039;s chasing after, Touji and Kairi, this anime is very nicely done. I love how the author was able to illustate Momo and her feelings between these two guys, and how these guys feel for her. <br />
<br />
The Bad: Ok... there are a LOT of points where the situations in this anime have been dragged out so much that it starts to become unrealistic. There are too many plot twists, and the anime tends to repeat the same story over and over. The author is trying to create these complicated situations that end up making no sense, and it&#039;s just over the top. Momo, the main character, keeps going back and forth between boys, to the point where you can&#039;t connect with the characters that well. The word &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot; is VERY overused in this anime, along with kissing.<br />
This is probably something that&#039;d make watchers drop the anime after the first 10 or so episodes, but if you keep watching, the anime starts to get better. A little.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
I just want to say one thing to the animators: Just because it looked good in the manga, does NOT mean it&#039;ll look good in the anime. The art style of this anime was kind of hard to look at. Especially their lips, solid shading, etc... I have to admit that the original manga art is a lot nicer to look at. But the anime killed the art. I would have gotten into the anime more if the animation didn&#039;t look so choppy. The art in the anime is defiantly one of the weak points, but for me it was bearable. <br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
The music is very recognizable for one thing. It&#039;s not bad but what i sort of hated was how the BGM used the same tracks over and over. i mean, they play the EXACT same song everytime the characters go to school, wake up, or take a walk. And then the SAME song always plays when a break up occurs. It gets quite repetitive. <br />
The opening and ending theme song are nice. I also heard the english version of the OP and ED and thought it was much better than the japanese one. I don&#039;t think you can find it anywhere on the internet sadly...<br />
<br />
Character<br />
<br />
Ok. This is defiantly the author&#039;s strongest, and weakest point. There are some characters that I absolutly hate, and some that I absolutly love. <br />
For example, Kashiwagi Sae: Momo&#039;s enemy. I&#039;m sorry but, the way she thinks is so overly inhumane and b*tchy to the point where she tears apart the whole anime and makes it unrealistic. She tries to lie to Momo&#039;s boyfriend so she can have him all to herself, but her lies are not very well thought out and the other characters are too naive. Every time I see her, I feel like I hate the anime even more and more. I mean, there are characters that interfere with the main character but Sae is just... a female version of Makoto from School Days. But worse. <br />
<br />
On the plus side, there&#039;s Okayasu Kairi. He&#039;s probably one of the most unique and lovable characters I have ever seen in anime. One of those characters you wish you could meet in real life because his personality is just so carefree, lively, and hilarious. He puts a smile on my face and turns the whole anime around! Kairi is defiantly one of those well built characters that makes you love Peach Girl more and more!<br />
<br />
There are other characters who seem to be a bit... useless and unnecessary. The ones who are &amp;quot;important&amp;quot;, but the anime could still be told with out them. From Jigoro to Morika, I found no real point of having them in the anime. <br />
As for the main character, Momo, i honestly found nothing special about her, but she&#039;s not someone to hate. In a way, I don&#039;t see what it is about her personality that makes Kairi and Touji go head over heals for her, but the way the author illustrates it makes you able to connect with these characters. <br />
<br />
Dub vs Original<br />
If you ask me, I see no difference. The only thing that was kinda weird was transitioning voices. In the english dub, Momo sounds like a strong and loud character, but in Japanese she sounds really soft and shy. It kind of affect her personality and the way I thought about her. I like Kairi&#039;s voice in the English version more than the Japanese version.<br />
<br />
Ending Statements<br />
I did cry at many points in this anime, but I still thought it was OK. It&#039;s one of those anime that are addictive, but not exactly overly amazing. In a way, I feel like the author is sharing part of what happened in their life within this anime. I didn&#039;t end up hating this anime, but this should go on my top 30 anime list. Give this anime a try :D

    This Review is about &quot;BITTERNESS&quot; I&#039;m Just being honest to myself and what I really felt while watching the series.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I&#039;ve just finished watching Peach girl and it gives me a creeps through out all the end.<br />
I was annoyed, disappointed and frustrated about the outcome of the story especially the ending because how evil can a person be.<br />
<br />
====================================<br />
&quot;This is the kind of tips that I&#039;ve gathered while watching all 25 episodes of peach girl&quot;<br />
<br />
-A happy couple being crushed by an evil demonic unhuman monster bestfriend and A happy couple being crushed by an evil demonic unhuman monster bestfriend.<br />
<br />
====================================<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Peach Girl is not just your typical anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review177899">
        about a girl and a boy falling inlove and becoming a couple but it&#039;s all about being crushed by your evil demonic unhuman monster bestfriend.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even though the couple survives a lot of obstacle and challenges in their lives<br />
there&#039;s always a high chance that their happiness is short because there&#039;s always a way that this evil demonic unhuman monster bestfriend will get in the way.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to torture yourself like i do then watch this never ending love story of this amazing couple that you thought<br />
that they will live happily ever after but only to see them hurting all over again then watch and enjoy this anime that is allergic to happiness that wants the villain to succeed even until the end.<br />
<br />
At first it has great potential to be a great but that potential was flash right a way in the toilet.<br />
<br />
<br />
===================================<br />
PS: To tell you the truth I really enjoyed watching it &#039;cause the story center in the main characters and it was focus only in romance and I know I&#039;m being harsh but i had high hopes for this anime<br />
&#039;cause the anime gives me the hype and the energy that i want in a certain romance anime but I know I&#039;m being way too critical but the satisfaction that I need that I didn&#039;t get, that&#039;s why I&#039;m so disappointed and frustrated.

    the only thing that got me starting this show was Funimation channel. it seemed really interesting at first, although the story line is cliche. but i decided to give it a try. already from the first episode, i could tell that Momo was going to be a pain to watch. she was so obsessive with toji from the get go. but it wasn&#039;t until later on that you could really see her obsessiveness. she threatens to jump out windows, get&#039;s angry when she sees her boyfriend talking to someone else other than her, and she waits 5 minutes for her boyfriend. any later than that,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28674">
        she assumes the relationships over. pretty obvious she&#039;s desperate for a boyfriend....she just get&#039;s plain annoying. her decisions were plain, and her love life over exaaggerated. <br />
<br />
everything about this story is unrealistic. i had heard many peopple say &quot;this show is amazing! i can relate to it so much!&quot; .......ok? u cannot relate to this story what-so-ever. it makes no sense. many plot twists seemed like they were just made in an attempt to keep the story going. like when Kairi decides to go on a whole trip walking the whole summer. yeah right, like his parents would let him do that in the first place, but basically the creators only made him leave so that they could try to make the drama greater by bringing in toji again. momo&#039;s feelings are always unclear. and she&#039;s such a sap and goes with the flow too much. if she cries and someone comforts her once, she immediately thinks &quot;this person was there when i was feeling down. i love him&quot;.....SHE CANNOT CHOOSE!!!! if i were kairi or toji, i would dump her. i just don&#039;t see what they find so captivating and attractive about her. she cannot hold a decent relationship even if her life depended on it.<br />
<br />
basically, the characters could&#039;ve been so much more. Momo is out of the question. she is no doubt the most annoying person in this whole show. Toji is just some freak stalker who can do nothing but stalk Momo, hoping to be her comfort when kairi makes her cry. that could be depicted as sweet, but later on it just get&#039;s creepy. he&#039;ll begin popping out of no where seemingly having no plans that day, and you&#039;ll wonder what he does with his life. Sae is...annoying, yet smart. she gets annoying because all she wants is to ruin someone else&#039;s life, but then again, she is clever. she uses her resources wisely in order to get what she wants. and she has backbone. but still... she is pretty annoying. the only thing that kept me going through this show was Kairi. he seemed aloof, loveable, and a sweet sensitive guy. his methods to cheer up momo were cute. but then after a while, he too began getting on my nerves. <br />
<br />
i&#039;m not gonna say much about the art. the art was good. it was different than others. but it had it&#039;s awkward moments. they didn&#039;t seem to focus too much on the quality of the opening. in many occassions, Toji looked like either a bird or a fish. and the sound wasn&#039;t good either. at first the theme songs seemed okay and fit the story quite nicely, but then they just got annoying again. like everything else in the story. the ending wasn&#039;t too good, and the opening seemed okay at first. but as you can guess, you get tired of hearing &quot;baby low tension&quot; it just loses it&#039;s catchiness.<br />
<br />
so as you can see, this show was a fail of slice of life. the creators tried to make it entertaining and easy to relate to, but it just didnt happen. i found myself groaning in disgust at most of the episodes, and the only reasons i actually finished this show was because <br />
1. there was nothing to watch<br />
2. something in me still believed that this show could get better<br />
3. i didnt want to leave it unfinished.<br />
 characters were bad, soundtrack bad, storyline bad, and...yeah that&#039;s basically it.

    How to describe Peach Girl....<br />
<br />
<br />
In a word; forgettable.<br />
<br />
The story is completely over-the-top melodrama, filled with plot-twists that even soap-writers would find unrealistic.  girl(momo) has history with guy A(touji), girl&#039;s friend(sae) is out to sabotage her life at every bend, girl meets guy B(kairi), guy B chases girl...who is in love with guy A...while girl&#039;s &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; continues to try and sabotage her life. Cliche angsty love-triangle ensues, rinse and repeat.   <br />
<br />
There is literally nothing in this story that you either haven&#039;t seen done (better) before, beyond the wacky twists that are hardly believable in the realm of reality.<br />
<br />
The art style, while somewhat unique,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3235">
        comes off at times as tacky and borderline visual novel-esque.<br />
<br />
<br />
The soundtrack was limited and overused<br />
<br />
The characters were (mostly) annoying and hard to connect with.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a soft spot in me for romantic animes, I really do.  Prior to Peach Girl, I watched Bokura Ga Ita and was completely caught up by its story/characters/music/art/etc.    <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve seen Peach Girl compared to Bokura Ga Ita(and Nana?) and for the life of me I can not understand why.   Beyond love +  drama + young adults....there is just no comparison between them.<br />
<br />
<br />
I give it a 4 overall....it made me laugh a bit, but for the most part...with every episode, I was just wishing it was over.

    Oh gosh. so many switches of the girl protagonist between the two guys &gt;.&lt; That was horrible. Every episode I just kept wondering How is it darn allowed for the girl to switch her love interest every time she gets hurt and the first one who comes to sooth her broken heart suddenly becomes her love interest !?!?!<br />
<br />
Story[3/10]: I was very displeased with how the characters especially the girl protagonist acts. She has be shown to have a tanned skin due to her beeing a swim team member in the past. Come on !! They could have shown some competitions of swimming. Her achievements in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review41582">
        the field, and how she couped up in adjusting in society somehow despite her skin colour. But NO. Nothing of that sort. Its just girl likes guy. He likes her back. But there&#039;s her so called friend there always to ruin her life (So darn hated her in the show.) They break up somehow. There&#039;s another guy who also kinda likes her. Then she starts liking him too. But he has another true love pfffffff. My eyes were rolling cause of all the pointless scenes. Jeez *sigh*<br />
<br />
Art[6/10]: Not the best of art but its watchable. Not too much of background scenery.<br />
<br />
Sound[6/10]: Voices were good for all characters. The openeing is kinds fun to listen to.<br />
<br />
Character[4/10]: All fail. Indecisiveness, Weakness, Dumbness, its all there.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment[4/10]: The romantic moments between the characters were shown fairly not in some darn ecchi partly hentai manner in which most series now a days have started to show. That&#039;s about the only thing I was satisfied with.<br />
<br />
Overall[6/10]: All in all really disappointing storywise. But if you want to pass time try it out.

    Lol. This isn&#039;t that good of an anime. It&#039;s got a pretty poor story and it&#039;s so dramatic and unreal it&#039;s almost hard to watch at times. Characters are weird and spazzy, manipulative, needy, and just not written well. Spoilers entailed.<br />
<br />
The female characters, including the heroine, are all very obsessive and crazy. Honestly, for a high school girl, Sai is pretty much the Hitler of this genre and goes as far as to get Momo almost raped just so she can be &quot;the best girl&quot; and despite this, they actually come out on friendly terms in the end despite Sai blackmailing Momo&#039;s boyfriend, getting her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review188922">
        &quot;boyfriend&quot; to rape Momo, managing to turn the entire school on her, etc. It&#039;s just so wild it&#039;s entertaining.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if you want to sit down and watch something extremely stupid, dramatic and all-over-the place, Peach Girl is the anime to watch. It&#039;s pretty much a soap opera. But instead of the mafia or something, you get insane high school girls. It&#039;s more funny for this than anything.

    I like drama as much as the next person, but I would never suggest watching this.<br />
Drama isn&#039;t bad b/c there&#039;s always a reason behind people&#039;s behavior, and I watched the entire anime trying to figure out what was going on. I never did.<br />
<br />
All I got was one girl (Momo) is obsessed one guy, loses him, get&#039;s stuck on another guy, runs back to the first guy when she gets a chance, then changes her mind and goes back to the second guys. <br />
<br />
Besides establishing that the characters were cliche&#039; (the over-sacrificing good boy, the loud boy who never does anything right, the mean girl, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37152">
        the confused main character bubble head) there was absolutely no character development. <br />
<br />
If your watching this because you like a-good-love-triangle-that&#039;s-really-more-of-a-love-scribble, or b/c you like dramatic relationships, or because you simply want to enjoy a good anime, don&#039;t watch this. But if you are looking for a waste of 6 hours of your life, this is your anime.

    I did not like this anime. Characters play &#039;The Love&#039; as a game. Love can not be  changed in 1-2 actions. It cannot be changed by saying two words. I hate from this anime because main girl changes her love from other to other. I not agree with that.<br />
Lovely Complex better than this. Try to watch LC instead of this.<br />
One human can really only fall in love one time and one person.

    I thought Peach Girl was an okay anime. I&#039;m not a big fan. However, when I read about it, I thought it was pretty interesting.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10. The story, as you can figure out, is probably very typical and you can probably guess each of the characters&#039; moves. Let&#039;s put it this way; if it were chess, the character would be losing. Badly. Although, all in all, the drama and suspense of it kept me going, even though I knew how it was going to end.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10. Not the best, not the worst. I was a little bugged by the way the characters were drawn, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3181">
        everybody has their own preferences. :) It wasn&#039;t bad enough so that I couldn&#039;t watch it, so it was bearable.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10. Not much to say; the opening and the ending were nice, but some of the characters voices had bugged me. But it&#039;s okay.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10. The personality of most of the characters just bugged the hell out of me at times; they caused more drama than there should have been. Oh well, I kept watching anyway.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10. Oh, goodness. Most of the time I was watching, I was more annoyed and frustrated, if anything.

    If you have a high tolerance for frustration and annoyance, then you can maybe handle this anime. If not, I wouldn&#039;t suggest this one.<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
There was nothing special about this show except the fact that the female lead, Momo, is tanned which actually didn’t influence or affect the main story. Additionally, she has a so-called “friend-enemy” or “frenemy” who is exerting so much effort to ruining Momo’s romantic and social life for a petty reason. For a rom-com, drama (which, BTW I really do enjoy), the story was quite shallow and dull. All you’ll see in 25 episodes is Momo repeatedly and indecisively shifting from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89621">
        one love interest to another in her love-triangle.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
The art wasn’t bad nor spectacular. The only art feature that distracted me throughout the series was the lips though. I wasn’t used to the upper lip being evident that it somewhat sidetracked me from the general appearance. Aside from the lips, everything else was acceptable. I enjoyed the flat, 2D art effect they gave Sae when she’s depressed or out of her normal self.<br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10<br />
The sound didn’t enthrall me. After watching the whole anime, not one soundtrack stuck to my head despite it&#039;s repetitiveness. But in terms of voice actors, they really complement the characters appearance and emotions.<br />
<br />
Characters: 3/10<br />
I found the characters very annoying, lacking qualities an average person has. During my duration of watching the anime, the characters just kept on triggering my temper and irritability to boil. The protagonists (Momo, Kairi, Toji) appear to lack common sense and are all indecisive. Instead of doing the logical and rational solution, they just exacerbate the issue by doing what they “feel” is right but actually is the opposite, which gets on my nerves. The antagonists (Sae and Kairi’s older brother) on the other hand, are conniving, manipulative, yet very clever and sly. These antagonists make me so pissed at not only them, but also the protagonists for easily giving in to their deceits and lies. In my perspective, Kairi was the only acceptable character due to his cheerful and happy-go-lucky attribute, but eventually shifts in the latter part.  The characters are basically the main reason why I got immensely frustrated with this series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
Although I was exceedingly frustrated while watching the series, it had this mysterious appeal that made me want to continue watching it, in high hopes the characters would develop better and and the story would improve. In spite of that appeal, it was still dragging, making me fast-forward the useless scenes.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10<br />
I gave this a 4/10 because it just wasn&#039;t appreciating; however, it did make me laugh in some portions of the scenes. Overall, I was disappointed in this one. If this was a movie and I had to pay for it in the cinema, I’d want my money back and wished I had watched something better.<br />
<br />
YOU’VE BEEN WARNED!!<br />

    I tried giving this anime a chance after seeing a trailer for it.<br />
<br />
It was exactly what I expected.<br />
<br />
It was cliche highschool drama. I found most of it very unrealistic. <br />

Momo&#039;s friend Sae is this horrible manipulative girl. I don&#039;t even know why Momo was hanging out with her in the show. She keeps wanting the guys she can&#039;t have and trying to ruin Momo&#039;s life. When Momo sees her boyfriend with her or something she automatically thinks he&#039;s cheating on her. <br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t suggest this show unless you really enjoy excessive drama and love triangles. While I do watch anime dubbed I wouldn&#039;t suggest the

    Well, this anime started out nicely, and as it progresses the story became rather dramatic.<br />
<br />
Ironically, towards the end, Momo was rather annoying and selfish in my opinion, despite her being the most pitiful character to start with. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, there&#039;s a moral to this anime, and that is you gotta be patient! Momo in my opinion was the cause for the commotion towards the end, this is because she was way too indecisive about her feelings. She was hurt by Touji and so decided to give Kairi a chance. It was all cute and sweet when ti started, but things changed after Momo found

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35384">
        out about Misao, and from then on i thought she was rather pushy and selfish in the fact that she likes to judge before knowing! <br />
<br />
Momo becamse extremely selfish and unbearable for me to keep watching, just because Kairi was abit late for the meeting she decided not to wait anymore and left because she thought he was putting Misao first before her without knowing the story! And slept with Touji her old flame, and the relationship sparks once again between the two. This was pure annoying because she was too self-centered. <br />
<br />
The one scene in which I&#039;d thought was a good and meaningful was when, Touji and Momo decided to go on a trip together in which Momo supposedly came late, and thought that Touji has left her, in which he didn&#039;t, and for that instance a message came to my mind, and that was Touji was patient! and he waited for her, and he listened to her reason, he said that&#039;&#039;there was still half a day left&#039;&#039; this to me was like a BIG MORAL in the whole anime. What Momo failed to do was, think straight waited and listened, she refused to wait any longer thinking he was wrong for her!<br />
<br />
I really thought Sae was much better for Kairi at the end because Momo character changed! <br />
<br />
But that is just my opinion = )

    I&#039;m here hoping to lift at least some bad impressions about this anime. Contradictory to most of the reviews here, I think this anime is worth watching.<br />
<br />
It was hilarious, annoying, sad, touching and extremely emotional. It had many themes that would make you question life, love, friendship and happiness.<br />
<br />
Yeah, you can say that Momo is a bitch. But she had her reasons. The whole story is like a matter of misunderstandings and awfully bad timings. But it shows what happens in real life. It wouldn&#039;t give you false hopes nor ideal situations where everyone can have their happy ever afters.

    This is one of those animes that most of you mega anime fans can finish in about a day if you have the time. I never have that much time so it took me a bit but this is an overall great anime. The characters can be loved or hated it just depends on where you stand. I stood thinking both guys were great and Momo was an amazing person. She deserved either of them and they both worked hard to get their girl. The ending was something you probably wont see coming and the last few episodes are very suspensful. The show is laughing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89659">
        funny sometimes and shocked or crying serious at times. You will more than likely hate Sae. Unless you have issuse with the fact that Momo is an angel that gets in the devils way. If you have a heart for soory ones though then you may just change your mind. <br />
<br />
Story 8: When most of you review writers out there write a review you look at the big outline that forms the anime. Well when I judge a story I look at the little changes it from anything else bits. For those of you who want an outline, this is a story about the basic two guys get a chance with a girl and in the end she has to choose which one she wants. For those of you who enjoy a story that seems unque when you look at the little bits here you go, this is a very unique anime. Its about a misunderstood girl who manages to meet a horrible friend who is extremely jealous of here but our girl the one most root for cant see it. I mean our girl is so insequre and yet so amazing all at once but she cant see how special or beautiful she is. She then gets to guys who are madly in love with her by the end and take note these are some pretty great guys. We get to the end she chooses you love it or hate it and there you have it. Oh and did I mention theres also a sleazy brother, an epic nurse, a school who will fall down on its hands and knees for a pretty face, a supermodel who gos for the wrong girl and a group of highschool girls who will follow whoever is the best? Yeah youre gonna find a story you cant even believe. And by the end of it there will be a character made story so interwoven you wont even see how some of them are connected.<br />
<br />
Art 7: I liked the art it was good. Not to complex and brain hurting but very good and led to good entertainment.<br />
<br />
Sound 8: The sound and music type stuff was good. I loved the oppening and ending songs. Whenever I remember hearing them after an episode of the show I can smell the beach and the melody is soft for the ending so you always end feeling relaxed. Its good that the ending theme is so quiet because sometimes the shock of an episode is so great you need something to help you cool down.<br />
<br />
Character: I loved the characters they were great and very important to the story even the lower non-main rolls. The noodle shop guy was probably my favorite minor roll. He made me laugh. Its very easy to create a bias against the characters in this anime. I have always found this to be a very good thing in an anime because its easier to be happy, excited, angry, upset, or even a little shocked when you take up the side of a character in an anime. A very wise person once told me that if it doesnt make you laugh, or cry, or get angry, or feel any emotion at all then it isnt worth your time and you could be doing something better with your time. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9: I thought this anime was very enjoyable and it brought up some great points in life. It showed the amazing things anime shows and it is a true representation of what and why anime is so important to things like life and love and courage.<br />
<br />
Overall 9: This anime is definitely worth your time and attention. Its amazing and a truly great thing.

    Peach Girl is one of those shows you will love and also hate at the very same time; and you will enjoy every minute of it. <br />
<br />
The story is about Momo Adachi, a girl who&#039;s entire life changes when her best friend pries in her love life and causes a lot of confusion and misunderstandings. Momo&#039;s best friend Sae is a conniving and manipulative girl who will do anything to make herself feel better than others-- including hurting Momo, lying about her and manipulating everyone into believing her. In an attempt to keep Sae from ruining things with her crush, Momo lies and tells her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review219268">
        she likes someone else. Momo is then caught in a love triangle when both her real crush and the boy she lied about liking actually like her back.<br />
<br />
The story was enjoyable enough despite sometimes being super over-the-top. I liked the pace of the story because I honestly never felt bored with what was happening. In Peach Girl, there is a continuous struggle and just when you think everything is solved something else will happen. Momo is a likeable protaganist. She does everything she can to put others before herself and is willing to help people even when they have hurt her very badly in the past (Sae). All of the characters had a lot more depth than most characters in this type of anime normally do. I liked the fact that all of the characters&#039; personalities/actions were explained and you understood why they would react that way. I literally went from hating Sae in the beginning to liking her and wishing she could have a happy ending. So yeah, you should watch Peach Girl. Just do it right now. I liked it enough to write a review of it at 3am!

    When I began watching this anime, I checked it out because it seemed girly and fun. I have a thing for love triangles and this one seemed perfect. BUT I have to say it let me down terribly. So every one should take this as a WARNING review. I will include all the pros and cons of this show. Kindly keep in mind that I am writing this as a newbie to anime.<br />
<br />
The show starts out funny and without making much sense. I expected typical slapstick humour and a bit of romance. The first episode was hilarious but from then it went from being a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review83853">
        bag of mixed emotions to utterly painful to watch. This is my first in experiencing difficulty in watching an anime. It was like a bad Asian drama with crappy writing. <br />
<br />
I have never seen a girl as indecisive as Momo. Just when I expect that she will redeem herself, she does something which made me struggle to like her. I think the last 4-5 episodes did permanent damage to her character. The writing and her actions were way out of line. No matter how much I enjoy the &#039;being with two people at once&#039; concept, Momo was the height of indecisiveness. She wasn&#039;t that great to begin with and these actions made her even less likable. She kept going back and forth between both guys which was plain tiring to watch. I actually have to say I disliked her immensely. I also have the complaint that she cried too much.<br />
<br />
Touji wasn&#039;t great till some episodes, but there was a time when I started liking him. Then he disappeared from the radar and when he came back, I didn&#039;t care about him anymore. There was nothing about his character that interested me. He and Momo got on my nerves pretty badly when they enjoyed being lovey dovey or making out.<br />
<br />
The only character I cared about was Kairi. If he hadn&#039;t been there, I would have dropped this show by the 2nd or 3rd episode. I really found him funny and loved his many sides. Then again the writer tries to throw in stuff and make him into an indecisive jerk. I was okay with that too. Then came some more dumb situations and all that was left was a poor version of Kairi who had become the victim of bad writing. His character had so much potential but the writer ruined it all by the end by making him mopey and annoying. <br />
<br />
Then there was Sae who I absolutely despised. She was a tad too good at manipulating people. She provided for most of the drama and was a catalyst for most of the plot. I couldn&#039;t believe it but she turned out to be very entertaining in the last half. She remained herself and toned down her evil side a little. I liked what she did to get the couple I wanted in the end together. Her actions aren&#039;t forgivable, but since she went through hell herself I thought it was alright.<br />
<br />
The only reason to hang on for the show is its ending. It was how I wanted and Momo finally picked the right guy. I still wasn&#039;t happy that she was making out with the other guy till minutes before she decides to choose him. I, as a viewer was still in doubt whether she still stuck to him forever or not. Momo wasn&#039;t very reliable.<br />
<br />
Anyway- the anime has great humour which also gets lackluster by the end. It is a roller coaster in a bad way, because say that you enjoy riding it but it always makes you feeling ill. The experience of watching this anime was similar. I enjoyed it but I am not too happy with it. I am just glad that it is over. I think I need a break from romantic anime.

    I want to give a fair warning if she had not ended up choosing the guy I wanted her to I would have give a 0 if I could, but all worked out in the end.<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
The story was awful, and it had a twisted concept at that. A girl in love with a guy, and a &quot;friend&quot; who does everything in her power to make the main characters life miserable, and along with this another boy who is also in love with the main character makes the story all the more complicated. I hated the story! She had a &quot;friend&quot; as I mentioned literally make

          <span style="display: none;" id="review227860">
        the class mentally and physically abuse her, and yet the main character can still forgive her &quot;friend&quot; over and over even though her &quot;friend&quot; pulls the same kind of crap every time. The only reason I even give a 2 is because she ended up with the character I like the most.<br />
<br />
ART:<br />
I don&#039;t want to be so hard on the art because this anime aired in 2005 I believe (sorry if I have the year wrong) , but I found the art to be bad either way. I will say&#039; even though it was bad I think it was the highlight of the anime.<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
I do not really have any idea what to say for sound because I cannot remember anything sound related in the anime besides the opening. In other words the sound didn&#039;t leave even the slightest impression. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER:<br />
I hated every single character!! The main character was dense, and did everything she shouldn&#039;t have done. (Near the ending wasn&#039;t as bad, but it was still hair pulling) The &quot;Friend&quot; who kept on making the main characters like a LIVING HELL! I have no idea who the made her out the way they did, but I really wish the made her more lovable, because I feel bad about myself  for having sympathy for an incident involving the &quot;friend&quot;, but any how i&#039;ll leave characters at that, because the two main male characters were no where near as bad.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT/OVERALL:<br />
Well I wish I hadn&#039;t started the anime to be honest...I liked the ending so I guess it wasn&#039;t as bad, but I highly recommend you stay away unless you LOVE drama, because this anime has a ocean of it, and it is extremely annoying to me, and I have watched plenty of drama anime, but this one was the worst anime not to mention drama anime I have ever watched.

    WARNING: Review will contain spoilers<br />
<br />
This is by far the most stressful anime I have ever watched. I honestly considered dropping it due to how stressed out i&#039;d get while watching it. The only reason i didn&#039;t drop it was bc of how captivating it was, now this does not mean it was good. There was just so much stupid drama going on i couldn&#039;t help but want to watch more; i needed to know what happened.<br />
I had also thought that this was the anime i&#039;d heard about when i was younger. Basically, I thought that Momo was going to get into a polyamorous relationship with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187087">
        both the main guy characters, and i thought it would be really interesting to actually see an anime do that. However, i was gravely mistaken, but hey! the opening showed all 3 of them being all lovey dovey together, so i just figured.<br />
<br />
Story: The story was pretty cliche, i mean, you have a girl who&#039;s disliked bc she&#039;s different in some way, but omg guess what?? It just happens that all her love interests are actually really attracted to that trait. Wow omg never saw that coming. Although, some of the events that transpired were actually pretty dark/taboo compared to other romance animes, such as characters almost getting raped, characters getting beaten, character almost being tricked into shooting a porno, and a character getting pregnant. Generally those aren&#039;t things you&#039;ll see very often<br />
<br />
Charaters: Meh the character were kind of a dime a dozen. No one was really all that unique, but you also have to consider when this was made. I&#039;m sure they seemed a lot more original in 2005. <br />
Momo was a decent protag, however she couldn&#039;t for the life of her just talk out her damn problems, like holy shit. Half of what happened early on could have been easily avoided if she would have just been like &quot;hey i saw this happen, wtf?&quot; or &quot;hey this is a misunderstanding&quot;. Omg and the fact that later in the anime she pulled a total toji when Kairi tried telling her abou this brother. //Rolls eyes so hard. Not to mention she kept going back to help her scum bag of a friend Sae. I mean, i like that she&#039;s so dependable, but she needed to stop letting Sae in to ruin her life.<br />
Sae was clearly the character that everyone was supposed to hate. She was absolutely horrible and would stop at nothing to ruin Momo&#039;s life. Even when they tried to make her likable in the end it didnt really work. She still spent her time plotting trying to get things to go her way.<br />
Toji was basically that &quot;naive, good guy&quot; who would believe anything anyone told him, aside from Momo that is. A lot of the early drama came from him always siding with Sae and buying into all her lies. Also he &quot;practiced kissing&quot; with Sae so he would be ready to kiss momo???? And then had the audacity to be mad a Momo for kissing Kairi, which was forced on her, before they even started dating UGHGH so dumb. I spent the majority of the anime rooting against him tbh. That is until Kairi fucked up just a horribly as he did..<br />
Now, Kairi is your typical pervy character who hits on all the girls, however deep down he truly cared for Momo and wanted the best for her. I honestly thought he was the most redeemable character in this show. He was always there for Momo and refused to buy into Sae&#039;s lies, and even stepped out of the way multiple times so Momo could be with Toji. He only really fucked up when he ended up having feeling for another person and acted on them while dating Momo<br />
<br />
im not completely sure how to feel about this anime. While it definitely wasn&#039;t anything spectacular it still managed to draw me into all 25 of it&#039;s shitastic episodes. I&#039;ve quit watching animes that were better than this one just due to being bored with it. So, if you&#039;re really wanting to watch some crazy ass drama give this anime a shot.<br />
