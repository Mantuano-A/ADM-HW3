    There is something inherently satisfying about listening to music. A reviewer recently said that putting any mildly evocative imagery alongside any mildly evocative music can produce a reaction in just about anybody, even if that reaction is essentially &#039;cheap.&#039; Regardless of whether or not the reaction I experienced while watching BanG Dream! is the one the animators were aiming for, the fact that this show managed to spark a reaction at all is why I rate it so highly. <br />
<br />
To put it into perspective, BanG Dream! is a story about a band&#039;s timid first steps towards discovery, focusing in particular on character motivation, growth, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246044">
        self-discovery. The title most similar in style that I know of is probably K-On, but, all musicality aside, BanG Dream! is almost - and I stress &#039;almost&#039; - as good as Your Lie in April in showing genuine character development. The very start of the show introduces the protagonist - Kasumi - as a happy-go-lucky, naïve but extraordinarily brave young girl, and the early episodes focus on having her meet and get to know the other members of the band: Saya, whose backstory is perhaps the most fleshed out; Rimi, whom I believe experiences the greatest growth of character; Arisa, my personal favourite; and Tae, who just sort of exists on the side. Okay, so maybe the show isn&#039;t perfect...<br />
<br />
The story is simple: learn to play some instruments, get an audition, perform at a venue. The art can be amazing, especially when it&#039;s clear the animators have put a great deal of effort into making the rare 3D scenes, but it&#039;s not anything extraordinary. The music is nothing special either, but it becomes something special when it&#039;s paired with the people who are singing it. I don&#039;t know a lot about Poppin&#039;Party - the inspiration behind BanG Dream! and the people who provide all the voice work - but their music is charming enough. <br />
<br />
This is the best anime I have seen where character&#039;s thoughts and feelings are so vividly rendered, and almost all of them experience genuine growth and development. The clearest example is Rimi, who, at the beginning of the series is a timid, shy young girl who is outshone in every way by her older sister. That doesn&#039;t stop Rimi from overcoming her fears, however, and she goes on to become one of the strongest members of the band, setting aside her timidity and performing live for hundreds of people. Saya longs to join the band but feels she cannot because she must care for her family. Arisa is reluctantly dragged into everything but underneath, desperately enjoys her time with the band. One of my favourite moments is when, because Kasumi is ill, Arisa, Rimi and Tae perform by themselves; these girls do not just exist to compel a plot, they are friends above all else. Several times during the show a family crisis or personal fear threatens to destroy the band completely, but that isn&#039;t the priority - this is a music anime that spends remarkably little time actually focused on music. The changes each character goes through from the beginning of the show to the end is what makes BanG Dream! so enjoyable to watch, even if its story, art, and even its music, are relatively mundane in the wider anime world. If you&#039;re looking for a story with strong character - one that makes you feel so many emotions, but all of them wondrous - I wholeheartedly recommend giving BanG Dream! a go. If nothing else, it&#039;s sure to make you feel something, at least.

    It&#039;s become a common trend in recent years for an anime project to spawn an idol group - it boosts the popularity of the franchise, and provides another avenue for profit. However, according to Takaaki Kidani, founder and president of Bushiroad, the company responsible for the BanG Dream! multimedia project, the era of idol anime is coming to an end, and band shows will be the next big thing. Which is interesting, because despite technically being a band anime, BanG Dream adheres incredibly close to the idol formula. You can buy albums and character songs for BanG Dream. (Shouldn&#039;t the focus be on the instruments?)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246068">
        You can go to a concert and see the voice actors perform live. And it&#039;s not just concert tickets and CDs that BanG Dream is trying to sell you; the multimedia project also includes card games, headphones, several manga series, and a mobile game. BanG Dream is an extremely commercial project, which isn&#039;t a bad thing in and of itself. However, it becomes a problem when the pursuit of financial interest comes at the expense of creativity.<br />
<br />
Everything about this anime is designed to be safe and inoffensive. There&#039;s nothing new or risky here that could potentially alienate consumers; just trends and tropes that have proven themselves to be successful thrown together into an amalgamation that&#039;s sure to sell. It&#039;s something that nobody is going to hate, but that nobody is going to love either. Rather than creating something that&#039;s only okay for everyone, it would have been better if they had created something that will be at least one person&#039;s favorite. Sadly, making a good show seems to be secondary to making good money.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s not much that&#039;s more generic in anime than a story of a high school student trying to start a club for one of their interests. With that premise alone, you already have a fair sense of the events that will go on over the course of the series: In the first two thirds of the series, it&#039;ll be necessary to recruit more members, and of course they&#039;ll all have some issue that needs to be worked out before they can join, and once the group is finally completed in the final third, there will be some last challenge to overcome. But genericness aside, there&#039;s also the issue that the series is loaded down with fluff. There are so many scenes that don&#039;t accomplish anything, when there&#039;s so much that needs to be accomplished. It would have been possible to tell a much better story in much less time if the staff actually cared enough to write something interesting, but as it is, the story is generic and insubstantial.<br />
<br />
Scenes that don&#039;t accomplish anything doesn&#039;t refer only to the half-developed plot; character growth was only sorely lacking. The characters start the series well within the lines of clearly defined archetypes, and over the course of 13 episodes, they never really go beyond that. There&#039;s the occasional scene that will hint that maybe some growth is going on, but it&#039;ll never result in lasting change. This results in a tragic absence of sincerity. No matter how absurd a situation characters are placed in, it&#039;s still possible to relate to and care about them if their actions and emotions feel genuine. Here, the situation isn&#039;t all that detached from ordinary life, but these characters are so flat that it&#039;s near impossible to connect with or be invested in them.<br />
<br />
Perhaps another aspect of this is that the characters aren&#039;t visually appealing. BanG Dream relies heavily on CG for its performance scenes, and this causes the characters to look really unnatural, especially their faces. And even when the show isn&#039;t relying on CG, the use of stills and pans is abundant. Over the course of its run, there were two occasions on which episodes were delayed by a week, and it also started two to three weeks into its season. It&#039;s not unreasonable to expect that this extra time would be put to good use for making sure that everything actually looked good,  but apparently CG was passable, and the staff couldn&#039;t be bothered to go beyond that.<br />
<br />
After watching a certain amount of anime, you begin to pick up a few words and phrases: youth, dreams, bonds, excitement, you get the idea. These are the types of words that make up the songs from BanG Dream - no real depth, just a barrage of platitudes and banalities. At least, that&#039;s how the lyrics are for the opening and ending themes. As for all of the other songs that are sung over the course of the show (like five?), they&#039;re left untranslated. It&#039;s probably no great loss, though official releases ought to get into the habit of translating song lyrics. Despite being a band show, it seems that the music really wasn&#039;t all that important.<br />
<br />
None of these factors on their own would necessarily ruin an anime. A solid cast could compensate for a lousy story, and some people won&#039;t care how a show looks or sounds as long as it has something interesting to say. The problem is, BanG Dream doesn&#039;t have any strong suits; everything about it is derivative and half-baked. It doesn&#039;t have anything new to say, and exists only to make a profit off of an existing trend. It projects a future for the industry where creativity is shunned, and the only thing that matters is marketability. This is everything that is wrong with the industry. Good riddance.

    I decided to give BanG Dream a shot since I enjoyed the tap tap hell which is the rhythm game. In all honesty, I usually go into these types of anime with low expectations and I set the bar especially low because of how boring the synopsis made the anime sound. <br />
<br />
At a glance, BanG Dream looks generic, bland and boring. Storywise, there’s nothing outstanding about it but it isn’t bad nor good, it’s more mediocre. The plotline is definitely not the selling point for this anime. It’s your standard “airhead gathers girls to start a band/group” which is fine, it’s supposed to be lighthearted.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246055">
        Although, there is some realism within the show. It touches on family issues, finding yourself and there are some very serious takes on friendship and relying on others. The plot itself isn’t completely predictable, there are a few things that might leave you wondering what will happen next. The story does start off slow and a couple episodes are mainly just the progress of the group which can be boring. Overall, the story wasn’t bad but it could’ve been better.<br />
<br />
As for characters, they’re all very likeable. A variation of tropes, you’re bound to like at least one of the main girls. There was at least one episode dedicated to each member, the development was pretty good for twelve episodes. The bonds between them all were displayed well and the friendships were developed nicely throughout the series. If you played the game like myself, you will notice an absence of three other bands, if you haven’t played the game you aren’t missing out on much so don’t worry about it. If BanG Dream does get a second season I would like to see more of these characters implemented in story rather than just being cameos.<br />
<br />
The artwork was nice, like most band/idol anime the colours are vibrant. Everything else was pretty standard apart from the eyes, they seemed to focus more on the eyes than anything else. Only complaint would be the CG, it was messy. Didn’t look particularly good and they would’ve been better off without it.<br />
<br />
Now one of the more important aspects, music. The OST was nice enough, it wasn’t memorable or anything but it did add to the atmosphere during scenes. Although, there were a lot of times where background music wasn’t used where it could’ve been. If you don’t pay attention to that kind of stuff then it shouldn’t be a bother. The opening and ending were nice, ending better than the opening in my opinion but both were catchy. The songs were cute and funny, the voices were raw which I can appreciate since they’re all supposed to be novices. The seiyuus did a great job portraying their character, you could really hear the emotion.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, BanG Dream wasn’t fantastic but it was enjoyable. Lighthearted atmosphere, cute characters and catchy songs. Whether or not you watch this anime is for you to decide. I hope this review at least helped you finalise your decision!<br />

    Here Comes Another Music Extaraveganza …  <br />
Just as always this anime revolves around a bunch of girls who gets into music that is finds their soul of universe !! well the main female protagonist oh there are only females no males well wanted to find something sparkly and shiny and finally find that in music and a guitar well so she goes on a hunt to recruit members to form a band !!<br />
The story and characters of this anime are inspired from the original band ‘ Poppin Party ‘ many incidents are taken from the real experience of the real band and thus the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246020">
        name of the band in the anime is also ‘ Poppin Party ‘ .. the real poppin party has also featured the opening and ending of the anime and a few OST too…<br />
The anime revolves around ‘something shining and sparkling ‘ ( you will see what I mean once you watch the first episode ) ..and slowly with effort and luck of course she gets to pull of members … and so the  story starts !!<br />
The story is slow and boring at first but it picks pace up soon and gets better , and interesting and since it’s a music related anime the voice and songs count a lot , The voice cast is superb and the songs are also awesome in other words they have covered the music factor of the anime well !!<br />
The characters of the anime are also exquisite and cool , they have a variety of characters from bold to shy , tsundere to composed , energetic to dull etc <br />
Overall one can enjoy the anime .. I hope my review was helpful !!<br />

    Man, where do I even begin with this anime. I was honestly looking forward to this anime (with all the love live jokes about this being the new sub for it). The first episode is extremely boring. You don&#039;t really care for our main character Kasumi. Her first impression is just generic AF. Happy, just discovered her new passion, dream seeking, klutz, wants to give it her all, etc. You care much more for her new friend Arisa who wont go to school for stupid reasons that aren&#039;t explored. You forget that she is there after Kasumi is looking for other members. The only character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review245589">
        who actually has development is Kasumi&#039;s childhood friend Saaya. Sadly the way they shoe horned her story is honestly terrible and really dumb. They also make a lot of effort to show Kasumi&#039;s younger sister Asuka who is planning on quitting the swim club. THEY NEVER EVER explain why, yet she&#039;s in the anime quite a bit. <br />
<br />
pre-END note:<br />
This is not a K-ON rip off. It had potential to be a good anime, but the story is lacking so much. The art is bad when they are full body and from a slight distance, the CG looks like they have flat heads, the sound is...average, the singing voices of PopiPa are MEh( But that&#039;s fine because they are supposed to be novices). All main characters are forgettable, you are left wanting to know about the other bands. (WHICH YOU CAN. This has a very good rhythm game for the JP appstores)<br />
<br />
But I guess if you like watching girls play instruments and have a ruff time trying to reach their goal... I guess you can watch it.<br />
Don&#039;t expect anything near a K-ON or even a LL. <br />
Honestly don&#039;t even bother unless you want more <br />
&quot;&quot;&quot;Character Development&quot;&quot;&quot; for the JP app game.<br />
(side note: in the game atm gitter green just has 1 song and no actual characters in game as of the writing of this review)<br />
<br />
FINAL Opinions:<br />
After just watching ep 13 of this series you can definitely tell where all the budget went towards. Background characters are actually there, full body shots look good. Their faces don&#039;t derp(except maybe otae, I still don&#039;t like her CG face). You can see a few other characters from the game&#039;s other bands and some interaction from Ako and Rinko from Roselia(posibly one of the best bands in game).<br />
In the game &quot;SPACE&quot; in not in the map, but instead another place called &quot;Circle&quot;. Probably hinting for a 2nd season, which I will probably watch because I&#039;m a sucker for music anime. In the end I still stand on my review.

    It&#039;s actually pretty good like it exceeded my expectations.<br />
<br />
The animation is decent, but that&#039;s to be expected from the studio. They ain&#039;t Sunrise or anything.<br />
<br />
The characters are all great. Though I wish they touch upon other characters a little more since they didn&#039;t fail to develop most of the main characters. I was expecting more tbh<br />
<br />
Story is good, and the pacing was alright.<br />
<br />
Music, this is where they shine. Like it&#039;s actually genius how they did episode 12 where their performance is not bad, but not professional either. Like, it&#039;s pretty realistic that they performed on that level since they are amateurs.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment, I felt a little

          <span style="display: none;" id="review383915">
        emotional feeling when it get emotional and laughs when there&#039;s a comedic scene. Pretty alright.<br />
<br />
Overall a nice 7.2/10

    To put it simply, this anime was put out to advertise a game that surpasses it in every way. The anime itself in my opinion falls short of being a great music anime however that is not to say the music in the series is not amazing as this series has some of my favourite music in anime to date even though only a glimmer of that is shown in this first season.<br />
<br />
The anime for BanG Dream is also amazing past this season, this anime felt like it was building up to something greater which is exactly what it did as both season 2 and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333316">
        season 3 are massive steps up in storytelling, appearance, and writing in general. (which is why I ranked sound 8/10 for this show as I know it gets EVEN BETTER in the future seasons(<br />
<br />
This anime unlike the game focuses almost entirely on the band Poppin Party with occasional very short appearances of the other bands from the game (Afterglow, Pastel Palettes, Roselia and Hello Happy World) and another minor band that is almost exclusively in the anime Glitter Green<br />
<br />
The game is a rhythm game visual novel and does great storytelling, the reason I am making this review is I encourage you to watch this show and explore into the deeper universe of the series if you dislike the first season of this anime.<br />
<br />
Now about the actual show now that I got that disclaimer-esque warning out of the way.<br />
<br />
The show centers around 5 girls, Rimi, Arisa, Tae, Saya and Kasumi who form a band called Poppin Party, this is a mixture of your typical school anime and music anime that feels somewhat cliched and boring at times however is still very enjoyable. It is important to know that despite this anime showing mainly this band that there are 6 bands in total shown in the bandori universe that matter up to this point.<br />
<br />
Poppin Party (our main cast)<br />
but there are also 5 minor bands of importance in this series (pre S2 and S3)<br />
Afterglow, Pastel Palettes, Roselia, Hello Happy World, and Glitter Green (who are minor characters in this show)<br />
<br />
A lot of these minor characters won&#039;t be shown much and if you are a player of the Bang Dream mobile rhythm game and coming to watch for those characters in specific you should know that you will likely be let down.<br />
<br />
The story is fairly rudimentary and isn&#039;t a shining point at all, if you are coming for story expect barebones basic writing, nothing exceptionally terrible but also nothing to praise or give props to.<br />
<br />
Art is fairly good, the 3d design of the characters can be off putting but they get much better with their animation in S2 and S3 so I can&#039;t flaw them much as it doesn&#039;t take away from what is being presented.<br />
<br />
I ranked character a 6 because despite the series as a whole having amazing characters, you only see a glimmer of that here, this is a great stepping stone into these characters but don&#039;t expect many major developments.<br />
<br />
I enjoy this series and I even enjoyed this show despite the fact it pales in comparison to it&#039;s contemporaries, I heavily encourage you to try Season 2 and maybe Season 3 if you enjoy S2 and install Bang Dream Girls Band Party on your mobile device to see the better parts of this series.<br />
<br />
Overall I rank this a 7/10 due to it being an overall good series and good starting point for the show, it is lackluster in a lot of parts and lacks the shine and charm the future seasons and game bring, however that does not mean it should be discounted entirely. Give it a watch, and definitely try the game.

    BanG Dream! is an anime what had the potential to become one of the level of &quot;Love Live!&quot; or &quot;Im@S&quot;, but watching the pv, i was afraid about the CG they use on the songs what are not part of the anime, and my worries become true, this anime tried to insert the CG on their songs, and it was horrible, i wanted to see some improvement in this area, but it is like they didn&#039;t even tried.<br />
The anime is full of weird facial expressions, even in normal situations, the story is bad, it rounds around a lot of problems the girls have because of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246052">
        their past or even their personalities, the anime put a lot of time on this, and it was horrible.<br />
You have a product, who already succeeded, if i were in their shoes, i would copy that product, anime, and i will try to make it better, actually you have a great game with a great story, behind this anime, i don&#039;t know why the anime decided such a path, but it was pathetic.<br />
<br />
Also the way they play the instruments is horrible, there is a lot of anime references for that.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t lose your time with the anime go play the Smartphone game

    &quot;Why does it exist&quot; is really the only way I can think to describe this anime. For a simplistic slice of life anime about a group of friends trying to start their own band, it&#039;s perfectly fine. Not anything special, and incredibly inoffensive. But fine. You can sit down, watch it, and you don&#039;t feel like it&#039;s a chore to do so. But at the same time, it&#039;s not going to blow you away. It&#039;s obvious that this anime&#039;s primary purpose is to be one element in a multimedia project, spawning an idol group, the game, ect, and that&#039;s really all it is. It does

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258773">
        everything you expect, and it does it in a decent enough way, but it&#039;s all stuff you&#039;d be expecting. It has heart behind it, but that heart is cliched in itself. <br />
<br />
I may seem like a broken record here, but that&#039;s really because I can&#039;t think of much else to say. If you enjoy the BanG Dream! game, or the songs by the real life groups that spawned from the project, then you&#039;ll likely like the anime. It&#039;s the characters you like from one of the bands, doing band like stuff, and becoming friends. If you&#039;re planning to just watch the anime, do yourself a favor, and don&#039;t make it a &quot;drop everything and look forward to watching this&quot; thing. The best way to watch it would be casually, in between the things that have your complete focus. In that sense the anime is enjoyable, but don&#039;t expect anything more out of it.<br />

    gorgeous and almost made me cry. i have a lot of nostalgia for the rhythm game due to me playing it nonstop when i was little. now i can&#039;t play tokimeki experience or sparkling dreaming sing girls without near crying. 10 out of 10 all across the board.<br />
<br />
Visuals:<br />
Gorgeous omg it makes me very happy when i see them in videos and stuff.<br />
<br />
Story: <br />
Cohesive and goes well with the music. easy to remember with each episode and no fillers!<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
if you can&#039;t hear the opening or ending without tears welling up in your eyes, it better be a 10 out of 10, or thats just how it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401604">
        was with me. The voice acting is top notch too!<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
all of them have flaws and redeeming qualities. i love all of them! they&#039;re all so likeable!<br />
kasumi has her moments where it seems like her actions may be selfish, but she never fails to resolve those issues or make you like her more.<br />
arisa is a tsundere character done right. her and her bandmates fight of course, like all friends do, but she always makes sure her friends are well or having fun when they are out and about.<br />
saya is a sisterly character that doesn&#039;t want to join poppin party at the start, but of course she does eventually. she has her golden moments, and her ups and downs.<br />
rimi&#039;s appearances nearly make me cry due to her crying being so emotional. another example of top notch voice acting. she is a cute character that always comes out in the end.<br />
and tae... is tae. I can&#039;t say much without spoiling a lot.<br />
<br />
overall 10/10 i recommend. it was a rIDE but thats always good if the anime is good! ^^<br />
<br />

    In 2015, Bushiroad started developing a multimedia franchise known as &#039;&#039;Bang Dream!&#039;&#039;. It started with a manga of 5 teenage girls coming together to start a band. Then in 2017, an anime was made with new character designs and story. And in the same year, we also got the Bang Dream! mobile game, which is now a huge success with over 9 million players, but how good was the anime that started it all?<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The story is about a girl named Kasumi who decides to start a band out of inspiration when seeing a band perform live. She makes friends with other four girls to form

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309595">
        the band, &#039;&#039;Poppin&#039; Party&#039;&#039;. I&#039;m a sucker for music anime with this kind of story, as I enjoy watching the characters grow and improve on their skills in the band. What makes the story interesting is the character arcs that our girls have to go trough, but other than that, the story is quite simple and even predictable at times.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Bang Dream&#039;s art isn&#039;t anything too impressive compared to what we get in anime nowadays, but I certainly wouldn&#039;t call it bad, but I also wouldn&#039;t call it great. One thing I do admire about Bandori&#039;s franchise is the character designs, Popipa defiantly has the most natural colored hair out of all the bands in the franchise and it makes sense since the characters were based off the seiyuu hat voice them. Background art is... alright. There are some nice places in the anime that have some nice designs, but a lot of the series also takes place in a school, so don&#039;t expect anything too ground breaking with the scenery. Characters can be quite expressive, but can also have a bit of &#039;&#039;derp&#039; faces from time to time. The CGI is... average. It definitely looked strange at times, but thankfully, season 2 got a different studio who have experience with CGI so the animation looks ten times better. The CGI is only used in music sequence scenes so you won&#039;t see them too often.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Listening to the soundtrack, it has nice tracks, but it&#039;s a very standard slice of life anime OST. Nothing too much stands out in the sound, but what I can praise Bang Dream! for is the music. Back when the first anime came out, Poppin&#039; Party didn&#039;t have much songs, but even with the little amount they had, the songs are pretty good! The music has always been my favorite part of the franchise and it gets better and better as time goes on. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The 5 girls of Popipa might be very standard character cliches when you look at them first, but they become much stronger and better characters as you go trough the show. <br />
<br />
Kasumi Toyama is the very cheery denki girl who&#039;s looking for more excitement and thrill in her life which inspires her to start a band. Kasumi is a very standard protagonist who&#039;s very optimistic about everything and never gives up. While she still has flaws and not the best leader, you can see how her character grows and improves. Whether her optimistic personality becomes annoying or not depends on the viewer, but I love Kasumi for how hard she works. <br />
<br />
Rimi Ushigome is the shy one of the group, looking up at her big sister as an inspiration in music. The character arcs in bang dream are always so satisfying as you watch the characters grow and that&#039;s also very apparent with Rimi. While she still struggles a bit with her shyness as the series goes on, you can see how she battles with her fears and becomes a more confident bass player.<br />
<br />
Arisa Ichigaya is the tsundere. Constantly being annoyed by some of Kasumi&#039;s actions and attitude towards things as well as being easily flustered. I can see how Arisa can be annoying to some, but the brutally honest personality is what I like about her character. As the series goes on, she also opens up with her feelings more and starts to really get attached to everyone in the band.<br />
<br />
Tae Hanzono is a very... interesting character. She&#039;s the &#039;&#039;airhead&#039;&#039; of the group, but the same could be said for Kasumi. Tae is my personal favorite of the girls, as she&#039;s so unpredictable and bizarre with some of her words and actions. She is the most skilled one in the group and the one most passionate about her instrument. She&#039;s a joy to watch throughout the show.<br />
<br />
And that leaves us with Saya Yamabuki. Saya is kind-hearted and the most mature, bu she doesn&#039;t get as much screen time due to her joining the band much later in the series. I won&#039;t spoil much, but she has the most interesting arc during the end of the series which makes her a great character. <br />
<br />
There are also some other minor characters, but they aren&#039;t as interesting to talk about. The best way to experience these characters is actually trough the Bang Dream! mobile app. As you read the games stories, you really see more of the characters that the anime doesn&#039;t explore, but that&#039;s recommend if you really want to get into the franchise. (The app does have a global release).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: <br />
<br />
I personally enjoyed the anime. I think my love for the franchise is because of the mobile app and just how much the app offers in terms of content. I enjoyed watching the characters and their interactions, and how they grow as a band and friends. You can really see how much they end up caring for each other and it might be cheesy as hell, but I love it.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Bang Dream! isn&#039;t fantastic, nor is it awful. I feel like not enough fans of the bandori app give the anime a try because of it&#039;s animation, not even realizing that the anime does a great job at developing Poppin&#039; Party as a band. I would definitely recommend the second season and game over the first season, but if you have interest into a music anime about a group of friends, give this anime a try.<br />
<br />

Bandori has a soul that is emboldened by its quest to discover music—and it&#039;s that initial encouragement that swept me along Poppin&#039;Party&#039;s ride towards becoming their own band. After having seen this, I can say that while it may not be the most perfect show out there, it&#039;s still an origin story filled with plenty of sparkling and heart-pounding moments.<br />
<br />
To form the all-girl band called Poppin&#039;Party, Kasumi—an oddball who has an energetic heart and a voice that blissfully melts my heart—has to meet the other members first, and earlier segments of the show introduce us

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299271">
        to them. We have Saaya, a caring older sister who helps out with her family&#039;s bakery; Rimi, a timid choco-cornet-loving girl; Arisa, who is adorable because of her gap moe tendencies; and Tae, the dorkiest and most comical one of them all. At first glance, their tropey demeanors can come off as being too vanilla, but I&#039;ll assure you this. Those basic traits of theirs will eventually pave to way to some sincere development as they realize what lies ahead in their musical ambitions.<br />
<br />
Before I get into the character development though, there are points throughout the show where the story gets quite shaky. Like the creators know how the plot points will chronologically line up, but didn&#039;t put in enough effort to make them flow more naturally. As a result, some scenes—mostly the sedated humdrums—feel out of place when they&#039;re shoehorned in the storyline. And those scenes can be distracting, considering the character development here rely a lot on nuances and subtleties.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not to say all these small interactions are meaningless. In fact, most of them are genuinely enjoyable to watch, and not just because they&#039;re heartwarmingly cute or humorous. With the constant focus on how the girls&#039; dynamic with each other evolves through their actions, thoughts, and exposure to music, their flaws and personal issues are slowly revealed, and this is where Bandori sparkles the most.<br />
<br />
Because the show is grounded with no overly ambitious goals, the changes Poppin&#039;Party go through feel realistically intimate. Everyone has their own worries to deal with, as is the case with Rimi&#039;s anxiety, Arisa&#039;s social awkwardness, Saaya&#039;s burdens from her past, Tae&#039;s general apathy, and Kasumi&#039;s optimism causing her to become oblivious of her own self. And it&#039;s through the start-up of their band—with support from each other and their family—where they learn that they can overcome these things that are stopping them from seeking out the beat they&#039;ve been looking for. As they practice, they discover more about themselves along with the wondrous prospect of being in a band together—and it&#039;s a development that&#039;s very fulfilling to see.<br />
<br />
Art-wise, even though I find it could&#039;ve been done better, the vibrancy at least works well enough with the narrative elements. There are stills and pan shorts here and there, with some odd-looking eye placements, but there are also scenes that look beautiful in the character-defining moments. The CGI isn&#039;t half bad either, as outside of the occasional off-model ones, it captures the fun energy from Poppin&#039;Party&#039;s performances<br />
<br />
Speaking of performances, the musical direction taken by this show is mostly low-key, with soundtracks that complement the relaxed atmosphere quite nicely. The insert songs are definitely the most notable ones, considering they characterize who Poppin&#039;Party is as a novice band. It helps that the creators chose to go with a raw live feel rather than using the version from post-production as it makes their songs sound even more authentic to the ears. From a rough and basic start to a more delightful result, their music resonates together with their development as a band.<br />
<br />
Looking back at everything once again, Bandori might have started off feeling uncertain, but its direction took for a better turn with its evolution towards an emotionally engaging story on Poppin&#039;Party&#039;s origin. They sparkle from their meaningful development and friendship. They make my heart pound when they perform. And I&#039;m definitely proud of what they&#039;ve learned before becoming such a lovable band.

    Review from a player of BanG Dream! Girls Band Party which you can download on your respective app stores (google play and apple appstore).<br />
<br />
So First off this anime adaptation was made by Xebec and i must say it&#039;s not one of the best Xebec adaptation to date<br />
<br />
Good things about the anime<br />
- It stayed true to it&#039;s source material<br />
- 2D animation<br />
- Great soundtracks<br />
<br />
Bad things about the anime<br />
- the 2D animation of Xebec could definitely use a lot of work especially on minor scenes you can see the animators be like &quot;meh this scene is not that important so i&#039;ll draw it half-baked&quot; which definitely hurts the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344010">
        quality of the anime<br />
- it&#039;s just a 2D chapter 0 of poppin party which you can check on the game in.. guess what LIVE3D animation ffs<br />
- kira kira hikaru intensifies<br />
<br />
all in all i really like 2d but ffs xebec you made me change my mind with this adaptation<br />
they have one job and they managed to suck on it

    I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
I like this genre, the musical slice of life with cute girls doing cute things. I like Love Live and K-On, Euphonium, etc. However, there is a lot of heart and story to this one more than others I&#039;ve seen. Without being forced, it actually feels like there is progression and trials for the characters, which is something I really appreciate.<br />
<br />
ART<br />
I don&#039;t think this animation has as much quality or heart as K-On, sometimes almost feeling cheap. Any presence of CG here (or in related games or music videos) is surprisingly smooth. Character design is appealing,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297551">
        however, even with side characters.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
Music might be my favorite out of those listed shows, and if you wanna cheat, more Poppin Party and Roselia songs and covers outside the show are mindblowingly good. Background sound, OP and EDs, and voice acting absolutely works work me. Songs that take part in the show are also bangers with heavy story bangers too.

    Bang Dream! is a pretty okay tier. I played their game and watched their anime. For someone wanted to watch this series. I guess it&#039;s not that bad to watch.<br />
<br />
Plot 5/10:<br />
So the plot, nothing is so much that standout. A group of girls were making the band and pretty much that it&#039;s should to. I found nothing interesting or outstanding but just some cliches jokes around. Nothing to worry about.<br />
<br />
Story 5/10<br />
The story are okay. Good.<br />
<br />
Art 3/10<br />
It&#039;s sad to see the arts that were poorly made. I can&#039;t argue much better that the art are very bad not that precious just a bunch of poorly animated

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341708">
        stuffs.<br />
<br />
Background Music 7/10<br />
Decent enjoyable musics. Mating well with the scenes.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack 8/10<br />
A nicely seasoned musics. I think it&#039;s a one of pretty good one so far.<br />
<br />
Songs (Extra) 8/10<br />
Meaningful and their dreams&#039; song are straightforward. This is one of my favorite songs in the entertain industry from pop anime songs.<br />
<br />
Character 6/10<br />
Each character has a unique character and should be but nothing standout that much. Pretty great to see.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 6/10<br />
I don&#039;t find it just must watch more like okay to watch. Which means it&#039;s no special.

It&#039;s been a while but now that I&#039;ve seen many other shows I feel like I can rate shows more accurately based on my own preferences and tastes.<br />
<br />
If I&#039;m being honest the story really is predictable, the art is good but maybe lacks a bit of frames every now and then and the idea of cute girls doing cute things isn&#039;t for me, at least in this format anymore.<br />
<br />
But this is a music show after all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337236">
        and that is the are which this show excels at. I think there is any other reason to watch this show all the way to the most recent third season. Unless you enjoy this show of course. Just speaking from analytic point of view and reviewing the story, art and characters it&#039;s not worth it. However all of us have something they like and others don&#039;t. I think the first episode can determine whether or not you will like the show.

    BanG Dream! didn&#039;t go out like a BanG!, more like a small dull thud.<br />
<br />
For an anime like this within it&#039;s genre it very typical in this anime climate but even then this kind of anime just can&#039;t be in the same pedigree of it&#039;s contemporaries..why?...well...<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with our main cast Poppin&#039; Party. Kasumi Toyama voiced by Aimi Terakawa our genki leader...check. Arisa Ichigaya voiced by Ayasa Itou our resident tsundere and main focus of quips and teasing within the group and the keyboardist of the group...check. Rimi Ushigome voiced by Rimi Nishimoto the bassist of the group, the shy one...check. Tae Hanazono voiced by Sae

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246076">
        Otsuka the aloof cloudcuckoolander one and the guitarist of the group...check and finally Saaya Yamabuki voiced by Ayaka Ohashi the drummer of the band and probably the only decent character in the anime. Yeah, if you blatantly haven&#039;t noticed, besides Saaya, the other characters are as stock and cliche as they already are. Saaya is the exception all due to her backstory and why she doesn&#039;t want to be in the band and once her DOES join the band...she becomes bland as every other character. The rest of the Poppin&#039; Party?...they essentially had Kasumi by coincidence gathered these characters together to form Poppin&#039; Party...check. The minor supporting characters are also there and some are supports...again typical but there are other bands in this anime and LA is more intrigued by the colorfully exotic bands other than Poppin&#039; Party...and they are designated to be only cameos and other characters Poppin&#039; Party just interacts with. <br />
<br />
The plot is your typical &quot;form a band&quot; and &quot;be the best&quot; as LA said, typical of the genre, however this anime just has ever plot beats of its contemporaries. From K-On! on how the coincidences lead down to forming the band, the band competition, Kasumi&#039;s later character dilemma reflects something similar to Love Live&#039;s Honoka in the first season and finally the multiple bands in competition have both shades of Love Live and The iDOLM@STER. The characters are no better with their stereotypical archetypes that any idol fan or &quot;cute girls in a band or idol group&quot; has seen. <br />
<br />
The animation from Xebec and Issen are well pun intended but the animation has a rather poppy feel to it, from it&#039;s characters to it&#039;s backgrounding. The animation is decent especially with it&#039;s character designs having a moe touch with some bolded outlines making the designs rather unique which is rather wasted on many of the main cast characters being stock and bland as they are. The &quot;Lives&quot; use of the CG however is probably the worst aspect of the animation, as in the CG integrated with the bright and poppy traditional animation just clash SOOOO heavily and the CG use is rampant in the almost every Live concerning Poppin&#039; Party, LA gets it Love Live did that too but even they integrated the CG better and used it in conjunction with it&#039;s traditional animation as the seasons and Sunshine passed and BanG Dream! on the other hand has this blatantly apparent CG in full and used for the majority of it&#039;s Lives (sure BanG Dream! doesn&#039;t have another season or anything but they never deviate from using CG in their Lives, it&#039;s just a mark of laziness AND consistency). Overall, Xebec&#039;s character designs are all great and all, LA just wished it blended to it&#039;s Lives as well.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is artificial moeness in a ways. From Aimi Terakawa who yes, is annoyingly genki to Rimi Nishimoto as Rimi- ohhh LA saw what you did there- Ushigome...as the squeakily shy vocals and Ayasa Itou as the tsundere and her vocals became rather annoying especially after her thousandth tsundere quip. The only two voice actors LA seemed to like were Sae Otsuka due to her nice tsukommi quips and her general cloudcuckooness and Ayaka Ohashi was moe but a decent one and she got bit more range due to her &quot;backstory&quot; bringing in her dramatic vocals into play. <br />
<br />
In the soundtrack department, the OST is ok enough though with Kasumi&#039;s singing &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot; over and over again you&#039;d WANT Kasumi to shut it. The rest of the OST is just &quot;ok&quot; but not to the point of being &quot;catchy&quot;...just &quot;ok&quot;, but it&#039;s like every other generic Japanese anime pop music you&#039;ve heard. You know for an anime that has music as one of it&#039;s core focus (you know..forming the band and playing songs etc.), the music should be one of the things you kinda had to excel at.<br />
<br />
LA will point out that it&#039;s themes of being a &quot;star&quot; or stars in general is hamfistingly inserted into the characters and plot which also seeps into the writing as well, sure something like Love Live also had their themes front and center yet they were subtle in their execution but they weren&#039;t as obnoxiously blatant as what BanG Dream! did with their theming of &quot;stars&quot; (Poppin&#039; Party&#039;s guitars are star shaped, the Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, looking out to the stars when there aren&#039;t any, Kasumi herself being one of the main driving forces for this theme), in it&#039;s defense, LA gets it, Poppin&#039; Party and by extent BanG Dream! is trying to have it&#039;s own personality by using this theme, sure it CAN do that...LA just wished it wasn&#039;t as blatantly eye-rollingly obvious what it&#039;s trying to get across.<br />
<br />
The finale arc as LA aforementioned to Kasumi&#039;s &quot;dilemma&quot; is, it DOES make it interesting BUT the other plotline being the place where the bands all play at &quot;Space&quot; is gonna get closed...LA to say the least kinda thought it clashed heavily with Kasumi&#039;s plotline (or forgotten until the final episode). Before LA goes into more detail...CHECK on Space being closed (See Love Live&#039;s first season entire goal for Honoka). One is that yeah...it&#039;s something LA has seen before just in a MUCH smaller scale, second is the fact that what does Space closing has to do with Kasumi changing herself into training herself to the point of losing her voice?...their still gonna have their band, the band isn&#039;t gonna dissolve if Space is gone as they can ohhh LA doesn&#039;t know...still make a CLUB at school and still sing songs at school and lastly, HOW can Poppin&#039; Party resolve Space from stop being closed down, it seemed more in the grunchy owner&#039;s own personal reasoning than a &quot;financial&quot; problem as to why it&#039;s closing (and the finale?...NEVER tells WHY but it&#039;s still closing so yeah...feels like an almost total non-conflict)...it just feels forced and checking the boxes for forced manipulation into trying to like the already stock and annoyingly bland characters. Two Steps forward...5 steps back... <br />
<br />
BanG Dream! is like every other idol or cute girls in a band anime you have seen only done with little effort (not completely though), from the too similar plot and character beats to it&#039;s just &quot;ok&quot; OST songs. BanG Dream! is by all means a run of the mill, checked boxes of its genre and expended as little effort to get this franchise off it&#039;s feet. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s no wonder BanG Dream! reception has been radio silent in terms of popularity. Yes, this anime based off a manga has turned into a franchise, from a mobile rhythm game to their merchandise not selling (no seriously) to only a little to no DOUJIN circles doing anything about this franchise. Wow...that&#039;s depressing...<br />
<br />
LA says all this about BanG Dream! even outside of the anime itself as the anime/franchise is artificial and desperate to go with the trend and be popular but like LA said about the anime, the anime is a stock, cliched with none of the flair that it&#039;s contemporaries has done better with it&#039;s elements and even better than BanG Dream! has done.<br />
<br />
From a seasonal point of view, BanG Dream! was a pretty mediocre to almost boring ride, it had a &quot;bit&quot; of effort in it&#039;s characters but it was a slog to get through at times. But nonetheless, BanG Dream! is definitely one of those animes from Winter 2017 you can quite easily ignore and not miss out on anything. BanG Dream! is mediocre and cliched being played straight without a hint of flair to it, not horrible or appalling per say...but on par of nothing much to offer in which you can find better animes from it&#039;s genre (be it idol, music, drama or all three).<br />
<br />
One last note but this is just LA, but LA would of thought that changing the focus from Poppin&#039; Party to ANY of the other bands could have made this anime a bit better...

    If you&#039;re anything like me, you enjoyed the tap hell that is Bandori. Perhaps you thought to yourself, &quot;maybe the source anime was good!&quot; If that&#039;s the case, be warned, because if you&#039;re anything like me, you won&#039;t come out the other side as optimistic as you were going in. It wasn&#039;t too good. I&#039;ve broken down my review into the core parts.<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
<br />
It wasn&#039;t terrible. But it wasn&#039;t good either. Most, if not all, of the paper thin plot was shoehorned in, in an artificial attempt to create drama. Hardly any of it flowed naturally; it felt like one needless hurdle after another. This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287788">
        is, of course, in a show which requires little to no plot in the first place. Look at K-On!, for example, a band anime where girls get together and have fun. Bandori, on the other hand, doesn&#039;t exactly attempt to be revolutionary, but it does fall back to the same tropes that almost every mediocre show is guilty of. And then immediately forgets about said plot tropes. It was a rough ride from start to finish, but I will say that it ended on a good note. There were perhaps two good episodes throughout the series.<br />
<br />
Art: 3/10<br />
<br />
Good lord, what a mess the art was. I&#039;m not exactly an anime art style connoisseur, if it&#039;s presentable, it&#039;s fine by me. That&#039;s what this anime wasn&#039;t: presentable. Right from the get-go the amount of derp-frames are absurd; more often than not you&#039;ll stare at a face and question whether or not that&#039;s even anatomically possible. And when they cut to 3D CGI for the music scenes (this happens often, so be wary of that) it&#039;s not any better. I will say, however, that what we&#039;ve seen from their 3D CGI recently as music videos from other bands (HHW, Afterglow, etc) look leaps and bounds better, so I&#039;m hopeful for season 2&#039;s CGI. (Which, by the way, S2 will be only 3D CGI. We&#039;ll see how that goes.)  <br />
<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
<br />
Kinda trope-y, kinda fun. A lot of the personalities of the cast are those which you&#039;ve seen time and time again, but that&#039;s not to say it was that bad. There are times you&#039;ll think to yourself, &quot;Of course, because that&#039;s what that stereotypical archetype would do&quot;, but it flows kinda nicely. It certainly makes for some humorous interactions. Some.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
This is a huge hit or a miss, and not everyone would agree with me. For one thing, I didn&#039;t like the singles. They didn&#039;t resonate with me, as I found myself enjoying maybe 2, 3 songs tops. The background music, however, was great at conveying whatever emotion the studio wanted you to feel. It built tension, opened relief, conveyed when a time was goofy, or whatever else music is supposed to do. It was good, it sounded good, it worked well, not much else to say here.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10<br />
<br />
Even with everything I&#039;ve said above, I didn&#039;t hate it. It wasn&#039;t a masterpiece by any means, but it wasn&#039;t as if it was some show written, produced, and aired in less than a day. When I wasn&#039;t reeling in the artificial drama or awkwardly staring at a poorly drawn key frame for more than what felt like was normal, I enjoyed the wacky antics of these characters. As I&#039;ve said, there were a few good moments buried in a mountain of mediocrity. <br />
<br />
Overall / Conclusion:<br />
<br />
If my flip-flopping stance hasn&#039;t been drilled through enough, I&#039;ll reiterate it one last time. It wasn&#039;t bad. It wasn&#039;t great. It was somewhere between &quot;just okay&quot; and &quot;good&quot;, which I suppose warrants a 6. It wasn&#039;t what I was expecting from the Garupa mobile game&#039;s Band Stories (which were pretty good), but those alone give me hope for season 2.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the Garupa Pico mini-show series more than this. If you came from the mobile game and want to watch something Bandori related, watch that. Otherwise, your hopes may be a bit too high from what this show delivered.

    As plenty of reviews have already stressed out, this is very much like an other idol show. It is not necessarily a bad thing. There are plenty of shows that became successful following a particular format, and those achievements should not be diminishes. Look at Kuroko no Basket. It just happens that Bang Dream falls in that specific genre. So, onto the review.<br />
<br />
The story is very basic. A high school girl, Toyama Kasumi, looking for inspiration, follows a trail of star stickers to a pawn shop, where she finds a red star shaped guitar. She decides she wants to learn how to play the instrument

          <span style="display: none;" id="review291473">
        and find people to put a band together. Everything works out in a way or the other. She finds the right people to play in the band and they are able to perform on a live stage. With some complications along the way, but you get the point.<br />
<br />
Through out the story, the main characters go through some major character development, making them a little bit fleshed out, and a little less one dimensional. At the beginning of the story they downright look like stereotypical anime characters, but to the end, you can see their personalities shine with all their flaws and imperfections, making them all extremely relatable and likeable. Even the ones that you are not completely fond of.<br />
<br />
The animation is not horrible, but they could have been able to do better. The CGI aspect is really cool looking, but it just doesn&#039;t save some of the more atrocious looking parts of the animation.<br />
<br />
What really stands out from this show, in my opinion, is the music. This is no Nana or K-On, but the music is still pretty darn good. Rock songs have always been my favourite thou, so I might be a little biased while going into this, but you cannot tell me that Time Lapse doesn&#039;t friggin pump you up. It makes you wanna do a massive workout, and run around doing stuff. It is very classical rock, with tones of pop and and musical theatre, but you kinda get the gist. If you like idol anime music, you will probably like this kind of music. Poppin&#039;Party is pretty standard though when it comes to Bang Dream music.<br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t just one type of genre. If you go into the game, there is a whole variety of songs to listen to from five different bands with specific styles and songs. That is what makes this franchise so much fun. Putting different bands together to showcase the genres out there (ranging from musical-theatre to gothic), with relatable characters and fun stories, is something that very few have done.<br />
<br />
To be honest, the reason why I am giving this review 8/10 is because I play the game, and I can see the characters, the story and the music develop in such a way that you don&#039;t really see in the anime. If you are just gonna watch the anime you might be a little disappointed, but if you go into the game, you can just see why it is so compelling and fun. My favourite band isn&#039;t even Poppin&#039;Party (Toyama Kasumi&#039;s band), yet they are still lots of fun to listen to.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Bang Dream in reality is not about Poppin&#039;Party. Bang Dream is Poppin&#039;Party, Afterglow, Rosalia, Hello Happy World and Pastel Palettes. Bang Dream is about finding your own musical preference and style, while obviously finding entertainment in cute girls and pretty cards.

    Bang Dream! is definitely different from K-On. The band aspects and the good music were in a way similar, but that’s the end of it. Bang Dream! shines on its own. The story is actually generic, its the usual plot that you see in any slice-of-life animes starring only high school girls. But what separates them from the bunch would be the characters and the progression of their story. The pacing was quite slow compared to the usual pacing of a slice-of-life high school girls anime, but very compact and solid as they were able to showcase everything. Their setting was also quite interesting. Yes,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292288">
        you don’t see much guys/men in the series, but the thought of having a studio cafe for girl bands sounds really BADASS. Even though it was unrealistic, it was still fun to watch it.<br />
<br />
I do want to point out the use of episodic introduction/focused arcs of the lead characters. It is the usual trope that we see on SoL, but I am getting tired of it. It would have been great if they layered each of their arcs since the beginning, then slowly their arcs would unfold. Just like how they handled Saaya’s arc. That’s the ideal way of storytelling, showing subtle moments of her struggle and background in every episode to get that right Bang! (pun intended) at the exact episode where her arc is focused. That way the viewers watching would appreciate each member/lead character of the series.<br />
<br />
Cuz I am talking about the some of the characters anyway, gonna start sharing my thoughts about them.<br />
<br />
Like the story, the characters were generic but still, really likeable. The main character, Kasumi, is your typical genki MC. She’s noisy, sociable, friendly and optimistic. I’ll be honest, I’m not too fond of her. Out of all the main girls, she’s my least favorite. Still, her role in getting everyone together is quite vital and she is pretty much the foundation of their group. The moment she collapsed, everything else fall as well. Even though I’m not too fond of her, I do empathize and understand her struggles. Her development wasn’t that large, but dang, it resonates hard. Her struggles near the end reminded me alot of my own hardships. So seeing her stand up again, with the help of her bandmates/friends, was really heartwarming.<br />
<br />
Now, for the other members of Poppin’ Party, my most favorite character would be Arisa. She’s the tsundere one, and she is very precious. After seeing her in the very first episode, I know there was something with her that was different. Not only that she is smart, she’s also innocent when it comes to friendship. Like I said, she’s precious. I also like that she’s pretty much the voice of reason in the group, and I totally get her. Oh! oh! Oh! Her friendship with Kasumi is so cute and precious. It’s very genuine. Though compared to the early episodes of the series, their display of friendship lessen. Still, you can easily tell that both of them cares for each other and are pretty much besties status. I am a bit disappointed though, her background wasn’t tackled much. It would be nice that she would get a proper arc in the next seasons. After all, I wanted to know more about her.<br />
<br />
Saaya, the one who got the most development, she’s okay. Her first encounter with Kasumi was weird, but in a way, realistic. I like that she interacts well with Kasumi even though the latter is crazy. Like I said above, she got the ideal character arc, and that definitely helped us, viewers, know more about her and her struggles. Her struggles were really relatable and her confrontation scene with Kasumi was one of the best I had seen in awhile. (kudos to the writers!)<br />
<br />
Rimi also got a decent amount of development. She’s really shy and timid, but I liked that she was able to overcome her fears and be able to shine like her own sister. She’s really cute too. Also, her being the bass player and the one composing their music….definitely a PLUS to me.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Tae. She’s peculiar. Tae’s someone who loves music and in a way…kinda dumb. She resonates well with Kasumi and goes along well with the other members. I can’t really say much about her, cuz she’s forgettable and the least developed member of the group.<br />
<br />
As a group, the lead characters play well with each other. Even though they are different in terms of personality, they still have the right amount of cohesiveness to make they group work.<br />
<br />
I don’t much opinion about the other supporting characters. Most of them are there only cuz of the story, though I do wanna point out that there’s actually parents involve in this series. It makes this series more grounded and realistic.<br />
<br />
Now, for the art and animation. Bruh, they actually used CG correctly. I had seen alot of failed attempts in using CG in idol animes. I always wished for it to improve. Seeing this series to have a decent CG, especially during the performances, it made the series more fun to watch and enjoyable. The character designs looked generic, but they are actually not bad. The overall art was pretty decent. Even the lighting and color scheme of the series wasn’t painful in the eyes. It was also consistent. Definitely alot better than I expected.<br />
<br />
Of course, I won’t move on until I discuss its music.<br />
<br />
Infairness, they actually have good music. They are fun and easy to listen to. I can’t really compare them to the awesome K-On discography, but Bang Dream!’s music are pretty decent. I’ll definitely check their music out.<br />
<br />
Overall, Bang Dream! was what I expected it to be, a simple slice-of-life anime about girls getting into music and form a band. In some ways, this anime is quite similar to some of the idol animes out there and I am not complaining. Bang Dream! actually delivers. I had fun watching the series.<br />
<br />
I would definitely recommend this to everyone who likes idol animes or the current plot-trend of slice-of-life, you guys would definitely like this series. If you are not part of that niche, I think you can still enjoy watching this one.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that is all for now.
