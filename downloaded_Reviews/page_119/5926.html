    I&#039;m sick and tired of seeing people treat Juuni Taisen like trash because the plot is predictable. <br />
 <br />
It might just be intentionally predictable!<br />
I know, how blasphemous! <br />
As if its intention was to besmirch the name of our beloved Fate and the tarnish the genre it birthed into existence!<br />
<br />
Did it really take everyone 12 episodes to realize that the show reveals the order of every characters’ death by the end of the first episode?<br />
Would it be so far-fetched to imagine that Juuni Taisen actually wanted to put an original spin on the battle royale genre? <br />
Or does every battle royale show have to be like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265581">
        Fate to be deemed “good”? Instead of trying to stand out with spectacular visuals, Juuni Taisen offers compelling characters and lots of new spins on the genre to keep you engaged.<br />

[Story: 6.5/10]<br />
In coming up with the score for the story I included both the actual plot and the way that the story is delivered because it is a crucial part of the experience.<br />
<br />
Juuni Taisen understands how predictable stories in the Battle Royale genre can be, and it plays with this idea of predictability. It’s a show that acknowledges the nature of its genre, all of the opponents in a death game but one will die eventually. It rubs its predictability in your face and forces you not try to figure out who will die next, but to analyze the show’s other aspects. Namely, the characters, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get there. <br />
<br />
As for the setting and plot themselves, they are fairly barebones but sturdy enough to hold up the exciting action and character stories. Whenever the show draws attention to the behind the scenes of the zodiac war it feels very apparent that it’s the most undercooked part of the show. Occasionally we see anonymous bidders watching the battle, but there is little reason for these segments other than showing us important people view the game as a form of entertainment. In the backstories side characters offhandedly mentioning how the zodiac war is some myth that is typically referred to as very important, but that doesn’t come across at all during the actual war itself, as it mostly focuses on the characters. <br />
<br />
The city that the competitors battle in is entirely devoid of life, with little explanation to the why and how. Characters have special powers connected to their zodiacs, although the powers are cool and well implemented into the action they have no explanation for their existence in the real world. Very little of the actual plot is clear, but each character’s backstory is enough to make up for its issues. The backstories worked so well to get me invested that whenever the characters engaged in combat I was on the edge of my seat hoping for the more developed character to survive despite knowing the inevitable would come. <br />
<br />
The ending will no doubt disappoint some people, but its tameness didn&#039;t bother me. For me, it concluded the characters&#039; stories in a satisfying way and it gave me everything I expected from the ending.<br />
<br />
[Character: 8/10]<br />
Most of the entertainment from Juuni Taisen comes from the characters, as you’d expect from a battle royale show with a paper-thin plot. <br />
<br />
The cutthroat cast of twelve mercenaries/warriors are each represented by one of the twelve zodiac signs. Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Boar. They all have special abilities related to their sign which are revealed over time, another mystery that adds a layer of tension to the thrilling atmosphere. Even their deaths are directly tied to their zodiac sign. This opens another avenue for analyzing each character, and frankly, it&#039;s not surprising to see a writer as impressive as Nisio Isin try to innovate the battle royale genre like this. Also, they’re all edgy as hell. All of them, it&#039;s funny how on point they are to the edgy battle royale genre style the show is aiming for and successfully hitting it. Their personalities are all very distinct and are represented by their character designs. Their designs also have elements that represent their zodiac sign. Whether it be Usagi’s bunny ears and high heels or Niwatori’s chicken style outfit and pitchfork for a weapon. They all look absurd and have the strong personalities and backstories to justify their designs.  <br />
<br />
Their personalities are quite overdone, but once you see the explanation for why they behave the way they do you’ll be more inclined to embrace them. Although a couple of the character backstories didn’t quite do it for me (namely Dragon and Snake) because of their stories, while funny and full of action, blatantly disregarded what made the other character so well developed. Even with all the absurdity, a majority of the challengers evoke empathy from their backstories and make you think, oh now I get why that character is trying so hard to look cool. At first, they’re vicious killing machines, then the show makes you pity them and you&#039;ll become endeared in their struggle to win, no matter how futile it may be.<br />
<br />
[Art: 6.5/10]<br />
The quality of the art and animation varies, it starts off great but has a noticeable drop-off in quality in the later episodes. While in the actual present-day Zodiac War the visuals are quite good, solid character art, a dark and moody desolate city, and sometimes really great battle animation. During the flashbacks is where the art quality starts to drop. In the early episodes the art and animations look good all around, but as the episodes go by the flashbacks have noticeably less motion and become mostly conversation scenes. Not to say that the conversations aren’t interesting, but the show is at its best during the high stakes action.<br />
<br />
It’s understandable that the budget isn’t huge considering it’s a new story from a fairly small studio. I can commend Graphinica for subtly swapping the art style to CGI to save funds in the later episodes because of how great it looks. Don&#039;t expect to see low frames CGI like what we got with Ajin in this show. Graphinica previously worked a fairly good looking CGI movie, Expelled from Paradise, so it’s great to see that they’ve only gotten better through practice. I didn’t struggle to forgive the issues with the visuals while watching the show, but I have to knock it a few points for some distracting quality dips during the middle episodes. <br />
<br />
The greatest saving grace of the show&#039;s visuals is its grimdark aesthetic. You might just call this &quot;edge&quot; and you&#039;d be right, but it&#039;s consistent edge that is totally in keeping with the rest of the show. Scenes are full of shadows, dark colors, and the fact that the war takes place during mostly the nighttime with rain and clouds during the day. Every aspect of the show contributes to this style and the visuals pull plenty of the weight. While the art is far from perfect, I can say it makes up for enough of its flaws with a memorable personality.<br />
<br />
[Sound: 8.5/10]<br />
A nice tense soundtrack that gets the blood pumping during action sequences. It ranges from orchestral music to EDM and I liked all of it. It’s also present during the slower scenes where characters are conversing to add a layer of tension, reminding you that they have to kill each other as soon as they finish talking. There are times it strikes the audience with some more sad songs to hammering home the brevity of some of the show&#039;s tragic situations. I feel safe saying it&#039;s one of the best OSTs of the season, as well as having a great alternative rock OP. The ed has a good song that’s more subdued than the show that precedes it.<br />
The voice acting is good across all 12 contestants and there&#039;s a dub as well that&#039;s not as good as the Japanese voice acting but it&#039;s nice to have the option.<br />
<br />
[Enjoyment: 9/10]<br />
Despite having exciting action, a majority of the show’s screen time is flashbacks and talking scenes. I liked a lot of the backstories, but as I said earlier not all of them are interesting. Your mileage may vary when it comes to enjoying Juuni Taisen, I really liked it but it may not be for everyone. If you can embrace the edginess regardless of the absurd plot then you’ll probably find it to be an enthralling watch.<br />
<br />
[Final Score: 7.7/10]<br />
When it comes to entertaining action, Juuni Taisen pulls it&#039;s weight with interesting characters and the lore behind them all. It doesn’t have the luxury of being able to slack off because its visuals aren’t anything to write home about. That&#039;s why it devotes so much time to its characters and offers up some intriguing hooks. In the end, it’s just a good time. If you go into it expecting the next Fate you’ll be disappointed.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Fate zero is an anime.....<br />
<br />
Juuni Taisen is an anime about 12 scumbag mercenary&#039;s named after the Zodiac signs or whatever the fuck, fighting to the death for one wish. <br />
<br />
Each of the fights are dynamic and interesting, but the charismatic characters, over the top action scenes, and its complex commentary about how war changes people in different ways ultimately fail to make this show anything more than a predicable death game with little more to offer than a stripper bunny and blood shed.<br />
<br />
Watch it...If not for the near mindless gore watch it for the bunny.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s 12 characters and 12 episodes and since

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261884">
        all but one of them has to die by the end of the anime... They kill someone off every episode, and to give the characters a little depth before they die the writers shove 15 minutes of exposition down your throat before killing the character said exposition corresponds to with an obsessive level of violence    effectively wasting your time because you just learned the backstory of cannon fodder.<br />
<br />
Are you worried about your favorite character dying? Well don&#039;t be I assure you that every backstory is written in a way to guarantee that the viewer will hate the guts of any character that gets one. <br />
<br />
Also it has a decent into madness type vibe so there&#039;s also that.

    [Spoiler Warning]<br />
<br />
Do you know what Juuni Taisen lacked? The music in comedy anime where someone does something stupid. Everything was so stupid here that it might&#039;ve been better to just make it a comedy anime. And even with that my score would&#039;ve been maybe 5 instead of 4<br />
<br />
<br />
After watching all of the show, I want to say that this anime... Had potential. And a lot of it. But it went downhill really fast.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m going to talk about the pattern of the anime, which makes almost every episode the same, the poor &quot;border story&quot; and why the anime which is tagged only as &quot;Action&quot;- doesn&#039;t do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265583">
        anything interesting with action. Minor spoilers but I do not specify names.<br />
<br />
So, when I first saw Juuni Taisen, I got hyped &quot;Another Fate? Sounds cool!&quot; and the story is pretty simple. 12 fighters, 1 wish, fight to death, last one standing (probably).<br />
<br />
Where did it fall off? Basically at the end of the first episode, but you only realize it later.<br />
<br />
Juuni Taisen repeats a pretty bad pattern for almost every episode.<br />
<br />
Show flashbacks of character-&gt;Show character&#039;s amazing plan how to win-&gt;Character dies a random, quick death. (You sit there afterwards and ask yourself what the hell has happend)-&gt;Show next episode&#039;s title which contains an animal and spoils the next death in the next episode.<br />
<br />
I have been watching it and hoping- Will the pattern break? And also, we are spoiled the order of the deaths, I do not want to spoil where, but once you see it and realize and doesn&#039;t break pattern and unlikely to.... You lose 80% of the enjoyment.<br />
<br />
The border story? None. They fight for a wish, that&#039;s it. Oh and there&#039;s some guy who started all this and introduces them in the first episode to that Juuni Taisen, we don&#039;t know who that guy is (....yet?).<br />
<br />
I wanna give props to the music (kinda), the OP and ED were top notch. The soundtrack.. Mostly forgettable.<br />
<br />
But the art on the other hand... Went downhill real fast.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, my score is 4/10. And if you&#039;re looking for a Fate alternative, you better watch Kiss X Sis because at least it&#039;s better than Juuni Taisen.<br />

    Every season nowadays, we get one of those “dark, edgy” shows that can make our stomach growl. From this year, we had plenty of those. Titles such as Kakegurui, Chaos;Child, and even Vatican Kiseki Chousakan tried to sell its ideas to viewers with mixed results. Then, there’s Juuni Taisen, a show that features a battle royale theme. Based on the signs of the Eastern Zodiac, it’ a character battle for the ultimate grand price of having a wish fulfilled. But honestly, Juuni Taisen is a show that betrayed expectations. It didn’t fulfill my wish of a show that is memorable. Instead, it delivered a half-assed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265577">
        TV anime that makes headlines for the wrong reasons.<br />
<br />
Juuni Taisen is interesting to note for its creator, the brainchild behind the Monogatari novels. While that franchise takes on a more narrative approach, Juuni Taisen tried to do something different. It became a show that heavily focused on its characters, ones that I honestly found to have many problems by their standards. That’s another subject by itself though. For this anime to succeed, it had to really get viewers invested into the story and be something unique of itself. Unfortunately, the battle royale theme is hardly original. The popular Fate franchise already had a similar premise while other shows in recent years also took on such an approach. (ex. Btooom, Mirai Nikki) What Juun Taisen failed to really do is not bringing in characters that are worth watching for but instead kills them off like they are some failed experiment. To say the least, that’s just awful to realize.<br />
<br />
Watching this anime will probably get you to realize what it wants you to like. The bloodthirsty action, tragic drama, and emotional storytelling is what people should really expect from a show like this. Unfortunately, it only capitalizes on a small percent of that. Its straightforward storytelling is very predictable as you’d expect from a battle royale theme show. Every time you see an episode filled with storytelling based on a certain character, almost always expect that character to die sooner or later. As for the storytelling itself, this show took a risk and it didn’t truly pay off. Most of the characters in this anime has some sort of background story, motivation, and apparently goal for themselves. However, it doesn’t really evoke any feelings in the end as it’s hard to get attached to them. With perhaps the exception of the Tiger, almost every episode made me feel less sensitive about the characters. I don’t feel much sympathy for them because there’s really no point to after realizing what their fate awaits them. It’s so predictable that you can almost guess exactly what may from scene to scene for some episodes. The worst offender is the Usagi (Rabbit) because this anime omits any sort of character development for him. He is literally portrayed as a psychotic abomination who tries to make “friends” and enjoys the thrill of killing. It doesn’t also help that the character lacks a personality and is there to fill the bloodthirsty action part of the show. By storytelling context, I do want to say that the show provides reasons for the battle royale itself and that there’s a larger end-goal than just making a wish come true.<br />
<br />
If you came for a show with graphic content, then this may end up being somewhat of a crowd-pleaser. The body horror, bloodshed, and overall psychology lives up to certain expectations. So really, if you plan to watch Juuni Taisen, you won’t be disappointed for a show that offers its violence. I also have to add that through its battle royale theme, the show sometimes gets creative with how characters uses their approach to kill. While it’s far from being an intelligent anime with strategies and clever psychology, some characters are deceptively cunning. The anime makes it clear that there will be one victor so death is something that you’ll see often. The way these are carried out can occasionally be impressive despite the extreme predictably.<br />
<br />
Adapted by studio Graphinica, I will admit that the overall visual quality gave me some favorable impressions. From the character introductions to the battle choreography, Juuni Taisen knows how to get viewers pumped up for some of its episodes. As dark and edgy as this show can be, it does live up to some expectations in regards to its technical content with graphic horror. Body parts are shredded, blood is spilled, and mentality is tested through facial character expressions. There isn’t much censorship either. Tragic background stories has a black and white stylish tone that expresses a sense of vulnerability. Most of the animation also remains fluid without questionable raw quality. The character designs are interesting to take notice ranging from Usagi’s man service to some of the sci-fi gimmicky outfits such as those wore by Tsumita siblings. The animal motifs and characteristics are also evident to represent the Chinese Zodiac.<br />
<br />
When it comes to soundtrack delivery, there are several qualities that makes this barely watchable. First, the battle OST is far too generic. It just seems to be there and isn’t unique by any standards. Second, there are the character voices. Some of them really doesn’t make an impact while others are memorable just by their voice alone. The guiltiest example is Usagi, a character voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto. His voice from this show channels the craziest and ridiculous lines I’ve seen from this show. On the other hand, the theme songs gives a feeling of melancholy and grimmer mood. I mean, it is a very moody anime after all.<br />
<br />
Should you really watch Juuni Taisen? As a light novel adaptation with 12 episodes, it’s about as predictable as it can get. Expectations were shattered in pieces once you realize what you’re in for. Beyond the predictably, the anime fails to get over most or if any of its character cast. Even when there are characters that you try to feel sympathy for, it ends up being wasted in the end. It’s a show that I tried to accept for what it is but ended up being a dumb action flick that ran dead on its shoes.<br />
<br />

    Some spoilers. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s unbelievable how terrible this anime is. The premise of the show is that these 12 &quot;badass&quot; mercenary warriors each representing a zodiac animal are pitted against each other to fight to the death for the victory to be granted any wish much like that of the Fate series. The battle that takes place every 12 years (like the zodiac calendar) is supposed to be a war that replaces all other wars in the world to prevent the unnecessary loss of life, but yet the show constantly flashback to each warriors history of years of war experience. This completely contradicts the whole premise.<br />
<br />
While

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262753">
        the concept seems like it&#039;d be fun to watch a bunch of people killing each other, the story telling aka plot progression completely ruins any enjoyment. It starts off with a interesting character you think is the protagonist by telling you the backstory and then kills them off. What a twist right? Then the show proceeds to replicate this formula for EVERY single character for the whole show. It&#039;s so predictable that there&#039;s no reason to even guess who&#039;s going to die next. Also these heroes are constantly dying in the dumbest ways to the point that each build up become anti-climactic. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know how anyone would think this was worth making into an anime. There&#039;s no character development and there&#039;s no concept of storytelling.

    Before the start of the fall anime season, Junni Taisen was one of the animes that caught my eye. The reason why is because it had the term Novel on what material it was adapted from. As in it wasn’t a light novel series or a regular novel series, but rather it was one single novel. As in all it needed to do has been done, and all that’s left is to adapt it to animation that has an ending in sight that will leave little to no loose ends. What started as mild intrigue was quickly overtaken with dissatisfaction as the first two episodes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265591">
        rolled around. <br />
<br />
Juuni taisen starts out in terms of its premise, as a very simple battle tournament between some of the best “warriors” in the world. The gimmick in this story is that each the the contenders is representative of each of the chinese zodiac. Add on top of that a desolate city where the contenders can do whatever they want, and you have a formula for some fun. It may not be the most smartest of stories, but it has the ability to bring many great fighting scenes which sadly never becomes the case.<br />
<br />
Backstories and their utilization<br />
<br />
One of the most noticeable aspects of this show, mostly because of how much time it takes from the show, is that it has a lot of backstories. Almost every episode has a backstory for one of the characters which is fine, I mean there are 12 characters and only 12 episodes worth of screen time for them. The problem is that each backstory is too long, and even worse is that it&#039;s the only shreds of characterization that we have for almost all the characters. I mean i’m fine with backstories as a way to develop a character and give them more depth, but it should be used as the base not the entirety of the character. It’s because of this that all the characters feel shallow, and it’s difficult to get engaged with them which in turn removes a lot of tension that could have been given to the anime. <br />
<br />
It’s also because of the overuse of backstory that during my time watching I began to wonder, how are backstories are used in a story? One of the answers i came to is the one i used a paragraph above, as a way to develop a character and give them some depth while serving as a base and point of reference for how far they have or haven’t changed through the course of the story. It could as be used as a way for characters to interact as a way to sympathize or persuade each other, as well as the characters and readers getting a chance to know the characters. Now how are they are inserted into the story? Well as stated above it could be through character interaction, but another way is through characters reminiscing over their past. A majority of Junni Taisen’s implementation of backstory is through reminiscing, which also becomes another of its faults. Reminiscing over your past is better used during the low points in the story when there is not much conflict and characters are allowed time to think about things without interruption. However since Junni taisen is mostly conflict it seems unreasonable for characters to think about their past, since they should be more busy thinking of strategy plans. It’s only used properly twice and that’s because it was before and after the battle royal, which is basically the low point, and it also does backstory via character interaction maybe once. All  other backstories feel hamfisted into the story as a way to give the characters some form of depth. They should have also thrown in a record scratch and a freeze frame before delving into their backstories because at least that would give them some value even if comedic. Even worse is what comes after each backstories that turn the show into a bore which leads to. <br />
<br />
<br />
Character focus and the wheel of predictability<br />
<br />
Junni Taisen doesn’t really have a central that the story focuses on, but insteads puts focus on almost the entire cast, with each given an episode each. It did comes as quite the surprise during the first episode when only one character was given the most focus to, as well as a backstory, to the point that it was made to believe that they were the main character. Of course that thought was dashed away as they died in the very same episode. It was a nice subversion of expectations, but the problem is that it didn&#039;t go anywhere with this. It kept on doing the same thing over and over again with each character. If they are the main focus of the episode, and are given a backstory than they are likely to die soon. It may not be in the same episode, but they still die in a certain manner that holding back their death for an episode or 2 didn’t really matter. Another thing to add on top of that is the order that the characters die. All you need to do is look at the chinese zodiac wheel and after the death of the three contenders, it’s easy to see how the show is going to play out.<br />
<br />
It seems that the people of the show were aware of the predictability of the show, and made heavy hints on how it will play out via the ending title, and the name of each episode. Even so it really adds nothing to the show. The show tells you what it’s going to do and does it, and does nothing else. It’s fine but leaves nothing for the viewers imagination, and removes even more tension from the show. With a predictable story and shallow characters, it’s hard to see the point in the story as it drags on.<br />
<br />
the fuckery of the junni taisen world<br />
<br />
The world of juuni taisen doesn’t make any fuckin sense. At first there wasn’t much to the world other than a group of assassins wearing costumes corresponding to their zodiac animal meeting in the middle of a desolate city to duke it out in order to have their wishes granted by the host. Gimmicky and simple sure, but it allows for things to be straightforward and brush of things that are never explained such as, how are they able to fight in a city that seemed to be abandoned recently? Well if they are able to gather the best killers in the world than they must be stinkin rich which also could explain how they are able to grant a wish and have people evacuate the city, via money and power. However in the same first episode near the end magic is also introduced through the use of necromancy. So that leaves questions that weren’t questioned now difficult to explain because now the wish and the the abandoned city could have been explained with magic or money, but it seems the writers weren’t bothered now to actually explain it.<br />
<br />
So now you have a world where there is some sort of magic in the world and the contenders are able to use them, but it seems that one ability is restricted to one character each. It’s never explained why only one ability or how abilities such as theirs play in the world outside of people being assassins. It also leads to a power imbalance as it could be possible for one of the characters to have an op ability that can beat the rest of the contenders. <br />
<br />
I think the thing that bothered me more was the entire point of junni taisen was that it served as a proxy war so that unknown people can make bets to take counties, and the whole thing is just dumb. There’s been enough flashbacks from the series to show us that there is still war between nations and fighting over land outside the battle royal. Is there going to be a change of government are borders going to be redrawn especially for something that happens every 12 years. Even then it’s not like the citizens will be happy which can lead to civil unrest and rebellion.<br />
<br />
I was also going to go into the 12 families and the happenstance of the character aesthetics to their respective zodiac, but at this point it’s too much. Basically as more about the juuni taisen world is shown the more convoluted and contradictory it really is. It looks like a bunch of things slapped together with not much thought in the big picture. <br />
<br />
Production Value and other final thoughts<br />
<br />
The production value during the beginning was fine to say the least. I liked the character designs of the warriors mostly because of how gimmicky they are just so they can be identifiable to their zodiac. Although backstory boars combat outfit looked nice as it had a metal gear look to it. The animation was smooth although it had a rough looked to it which i personally liked even some of the cg animation was good. But that’s just the beginning as the quality in terms of both art and animation go down. Animation starts to look jagged and cg is used even though the characters are standing around which looks ridiculous. In terms of sound there’s nothing to harp about as most of it was forgettable. Characters sound like how they’re supposed to sound, and music play when it’s suppose to, but nothing truly stands out.<br />
<br />
Going into this show i was at least expecting some action shlock, but it seems that wasn&#039;t the case. There were interesting things in the show for sure such as the backstories which themselves could make interesting stories, but they are confined to this one. There was also some “witty” writing when it came to the characters and what they represent, but nothing mind blowing. This is a show that said it will do a thing, did it, and nothing more.

    This is an extremely fast-paced show so if you are the type of person that likes deep character development and to bond with the characters in a killing game story this might not be for you. If you are the type of person to like nonstop action with a small amount of character development you&#039;ve come to the right place. Every episode we learn the short backstory of a character then we watch them fight.  The story itself is about 12 people representing the zodiac killing each other to retrieve a poisoned gem from each other bodies and then getting the one inside you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261672">
        taken out upon victory. Somehow we have pacifists in this competition but that&#039;s not important. We don&#039;t know exactly why people showed up for this tournament but maybe we will learn. I do like any killing game plot and this is no different but I like character development also so I have a love hate relationship with this show maybe you won&#039;t.<br />
<br />
The art is amazing as shows like this need good art because there is so much going on and people will drop janky and bad art like a sack of rocks. They have nothing to hide behind with this show and I appreciate the effort. <br />
<br />
The music is also pretty nice and fits everything the show needs well. You know what you&#039;re getting just from the music used when it shows up. The voice acting is also pretty good.<br />
<br />
Like I said before we get a short backstory every episode for each character then we don&#039;t learn much more about them. I don&#039;t mean that as a bad thing though. So you can&#039;t make bonds with everyone except for maybe the pacifists if they live long enough. What I will pick out is the powers. Every character has an ability related to their zodiac even if it may not seem like it. the chicken can control birds, the boar holds ammo like a pig does it&#039;s slop with endless reloading so she never has to stop firing her gun as long as she has ammo like a pig never stop eating as long as they have food. The rabbit has necromancy so the people he kills does his bidding for him with their powers intact I don&#039;t know how to compare that one. The dog can control poisons I guess because dogs can sniff them out and etc.<br />
I like the way they balance this powers out so no one is too overpowered even though all the dog has to do is sit around until everyone else dies since he is immune to poisons.<br />
<br />
Overall I&#039;m loving this anime and can&#039;t wait for a new episode every week especially since we have so many duds this season. I&#039;m somewhat liking everything about this show and hope it keeps it up. They even keep you on your toes by throwing you things you may never expect.

    Sometimes it is easy to grab a club and hit a series as hard as possible with an unconvincing criticism, and we forget that our tastes are not the same as those of the readers.<br />
<br />
The plot is about a group of assassins (zodiac configuration) who joined a fight to death called Juuni Taisen, that&#039;s all.<br />
<br />
First, let me ask you something. What story do you expect from a fight to the death or deathmatch? All the characters will die, so the story is easy to follow. The substantial part of the spectacle is not in the fight against death itself; it is in the background from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265664">
        the secondary stories. Besides, all the personality, skills and reasons to be in the battle are explained in the secondary stories. Why should an author focus on the deathmatch, knowing the predictable outcome? The anime gives constant clues about WHO will die later, so pretending to be surprised by the plot is a big mistake. Do not have high hopes for the story, it is predictable but you can enjoy the small stories and the animation instead. Remember, it is not Death Note, Made in the Abyss, etc.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, ¿what will you expect from these characters? In summary, they all are assassins, murderers, most of them are psychopaths and antisocials so what background do you want to see? A killer lover of all living beings? ¿A killer, that have some morals and will cry at night for all the persons that died? They are not like Monkey, and that character was a killer as well. Please, do not overthink a deathmatch plot and do not try to explain it either with false and bold arguments.<br />
<br />
The art is normal. The show is predictable.  Moreover,  for an animation studio is hard to invest a significant amount of money and time in some fights when the outcome is evident for the audience. Also, the chapters try to explain the character&#039;s perspective, so the animation used is acceptable for this purpose. On the other hand, the sound is typical, it helps with the fights and boosts the events but nothing more. The OP was ok.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, the show gives the casual enjoyment when you watch any predictable show. For example, you could enjoy the character&#039;s short stories, but you already know the outcome, so you will feel a bit disappointed at the end because the show did not fulfill a more significant plot.<br />
<br />
Overall 6.5 rounded 7.0<br />
<br />
Finally, the show has some remarkable short stories, but not all them are fascinating. The plot isn&#039;t hard to follow, and it is very predictable. However, the outcome fits the adaptation&#039;s objective and relinquish some information about the characters using short stories. Sadly, the pacing could be a problem because the time between the short story and the dead of the characters do not allow any further character progression. Besides, the show isn&#039;t as bad as some reviewers are trying to manifest. A lot of spectators will enjoy that genre and the story, but the show isn&#039;t fantastic either, so if you expect too much from it, you could receive a hit in the face.

    I am sick of people saying that this anime is a non-sense. I loved the anime from the beginning. The first 2 episodes were totally unpredictable and then it got predictable. The unpredictability once again returns in the last episode. I mean who would&#039;ve thought that.<br />
 This anime is not just about action but also has awakening meaning.You get pretty awesome action. Intense strategizing. All 12 characters different in their thinking (except for the Dragon &amp; Snake Brothers). Overall I loved it. I was excited every single episode. the OP is excellent. Art could be better though. One Bright spot in the Fall2017.

    I think this may be the most underrated anime of the season... but for good reason.<br />
<br />
Juuni Taisen is a battle royale anime, pitting 12 characters against each other in a fight to the death. A simple enough premise right? Every character is explored and as a result you do feel some connection or sympathy with a character when they die. And as its a Battle Royale, nearly every character... well dies. Written by the same writer of Katanagatari this anime is NOT meant to be a Mystery anime. People come into this show and somehow become upset when a character they like dies - if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262244">
        you can&#039;t stand shows like Game of Thrones or Breaking bad where characters that are built up die because thats the context of the world they are in, this show isn&#039;t for you.<br />
<br />
Putting aside the obvious which apparently needs to be said, this show is moreso like a character study instead of a pure action anime. When put into a situation like this, every soldier/warrior has a different creed/way of thinking that leads them to act the way they do both in everyday life and in this said situation. What makes this show incredibly enjoyable is that we get to see multiple perspectives of how to handle a situation like a Battle Royale with every character receiving a thoughtful depiction. Yes there is gore and yes there is violence, but stripped to its core Juuni Taisen is more like an episodic case study show of how characters would act/behave within the given world of Juuni Taisen.<br />
<br />
Its a fairly straightforward story -&gt; Characters connive, plan, team up and kill. Art is alright. Only thing to really note is CGI is used for once in an anime fairly seamlessly within the show, which not many shows have been able to manage to pull off. Sound fits the show and helps with characterizations. Again, despite this being an action anime this show shines the most at being a set of individual character studies. Some of the other reviews here dislike the fact that characters they became attached to... well died. If you are willing to accept that fact, this becomes a thoroughly enjoyable show to watch.<br />
<br />
This show isn&#039;t going to have you thinking about large philosophical questions like a Shinseaki Yori, but it does what it sets out to do. Provide a Battle Royale where every character is provided characterization and their methods/ideas are explored and examined. I would sincerely say this is one of the most enjoyable anime of this season.

    Imagine a battle royale anime... but the studio *really* doesn&#039;t want to animate fighting. Well, look no further than Juuni Taisen, a fighting anime where fights last on average anywhere from 3 to 10 seconds. I&#039;m not exaggerating. There was a lot of fluff to make you *think* fights were longer, but they truly weren&#039;t. What do they fill the rest of the episode with, you ask? Flashbacks. Yes, you get to watch roughly 20 minutes of uninteresting backstory and characters moving around the map, only to have them die within literal seconds of encountering another participant. They don&#039;t even die in interesting ways. They

          <span style="display: none;" id="review379431">
        just Alt + F4 out of the script. This is one of the most boring anime I&#039;ve ever seen, and I don&#039;t understand why it exists. <br />
<br />
Outside of episode 1, the art and animation are both subpar. The soundtrack is forgettable. A majority of the characters aren&#039;t likable or interesting. The character design is boring for the most part. The anime refuses to answer questions that most viewers would probably be asking. It just fails in almost every conceivable category. Most notably, it fails to deliver on it&#039;s choice of genre. The only reason I gave it a 2, was because I thought the dialogue and voice acting were fine. This anime is a complete waste of time and should be avoided, in my opinion.

    It&#039;s a good anime, but I see some problems. Like, if you really pay attention you can see the order of the deaths by just looking at the ending animation. And on the episode 9 the animation is not that good. But still funny to watch everybody dying in different and unexpected ways.<br />
<br />
The anime doesn&#039;t give you time to enjoy the characters fully, but the flashback on their stories makes us like them a little more, even though they die very easily.I like the way lifes are so volatile and end so quiclky, it gives tension to the work and gives us more expectations.

    Juuni Taisen is one of the best examples of a bonafide &quot;what if&quot; anime: What if the show was 24 instead of 12 episodes? What if the art and animation were more consistent? What if half the show wasn&#039;t pure flashbacks? What if the character deaths weren&#039;t so laughably predictable? I really could go on, and it&#039;s a shame imagining what could have been an outstanding show. <br />
<br />
The anime is plagued by a myriad of small problems which by themselves would be insignificant and ignorable, but when you account for so many of them, it becomes detrimental to the viewing experience. On its surface, Juuni

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265579">
        Taisen aspires to be an epic, exhilarating battle royale where 12 warriors representing the signs of the Chinese zodiac volunteer or are chosen to partake in the brawl, with the winner to be granted any one wish. <br />
<br />
Naturally, comparisons will be made to the Fate/Stay Night series, and while that juxtaposition isn&#039;t too far-fetched, Juuni Taisen is far more character driven and in that fact lies the show&#039;s greatest strengths and weaknesses. On principle, most of us can&#039;t get attached to characters if a said character received little to no screen time, or barely any development or backstory. To meet this principle, the anime dedicates one episode to most of the characters, where we see the conflict from their point of view and learn about their past. The problem here is that their backstory is told through an often intruding and abysmally long flash back that takes up the majority of their episode. I&#039;m not one of those guys that hates flashbacks, heck I loved the original Naruto, but the difference here is that Naruto had dozens of episodes to tell its story and flesh out all its characters; Juuni Taisen does not have that time or liberty, so to see almost all of a character&#039;s screen time be dedicated to a flashback feels like a superfluous disservice to them, however effective it might have been to their development.<br />
<br />
Speaking of disservice, one thing I&#039;m sure that bothered others besides me was how suddenly the majority of the characters are killed off. About 80% of all the characters perish instantly to a sneak attack or die sacrificing themselves for another character. You can hardly call this an action anime if only 2 or 3 of the characters die fighting, while the others never really even got a chance to shine in the combat they so loved. Again, I&#039;m not an action enthusiast, but if you&#039;re going to dump a huge flashback on us only to suddenly kill the character off afterwards, you&#039;ve wasted any potential for growth that character might have had, as well as what could&#039;ve been a great fight. <br />
<br />
And that leads to the other problem: Predicable deaths, very predictable deaths. The anime is very formulaic --- The episode focuses on one character, they get a 15 minute long flashback, and about 2 or 3 minutes after the flashback ends, they die, usually without a fight. While this isn&#039;t always the case, you can usually guess with surprising accuracy the next character to be killed off by just figuring out which character that previously got no screen time is suddenly getting lots and go from there. In this anime, flashbacks are the death flags, and screen time is the precursor to that. <br />
<br />
The last bit of bad news if you&#039;re interested in this anime is the often wonky art and animation. It&#039;s all over the place to be honest, bouncing between amazing and sluggishly lazy. Honestly, at the times when the animation is downright jaw dropping, it only irks me even more for the lack of action scenes that could have greatly utilized it. Even the CGI is fluid and alive, might even be the best CGI I&#039;ve seen in anime. But again, it all varies as sometimes the art devolves significantly past the point of saying its the anime&#039;s art style and just leaves me wondering &quot;why?&quot; But of all the negatives, this one is probably the most ignorable. <br />
<br />
As for strengths, the biggest one is that its very character driven and knows how to make us care for characters in such a short amount of time, but it comes at the cost of the above negatives and due to the nature of the anime, the characters would not live long enough anyway to solidify a deep connection to. More episodes would have been amazing for this show, but we have to consume what we have been served. I can also say with certainty that not one of the problems I listed was enough to affect my overall positive enjoyment of the show, and my lower overall rating of 6 is  mostly due to objective critique. I&#039;m a firm believer of watching a show for the enjoyment rather that to look to criticize it, so if the synopsis interests you at all, I still recommend you give it a try. Just bear in mind the above qualms and perhaps lower expectations accordingly.<br />
<br />
In all, Juuni Taisen presents a simple yet effective story with compelling characters, though both of these are mired down by easy predictability and a lack of focus on action where there should be more of it. There was a lot of missed potential here, but at the same time it hit just enough right marks to distinguish itself as something truly unique in its field.

    This work is not a battle royale cliche you see dozens of times adapted, but a mere mainframe to explore the way of the warior with heavy character emphasis. From the start it&#039;s just 12 people, essentially and aesthetically bound by simbolysm ties which alone should haw rang a bell for anyone with more exposure to books rather than mainstream media.<br />
Looking at how the story is build around 12 episodes, there is almost no room for more world building or entertainment candy by prolonged character study and stretched EPIC fight visuals. It&#039;s bound to realism even with the fanatasy elements in it.  I could

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265328">
        even call it cruel; how all aspects of life are finite in the end - if you are to strong, fights are one sided and quick, deception and technology can fight on equal grounds against the strong, but no matter how strong anybody gets, no one can be a one man army in the end. Thus, the value of the warrior lies in his led life of fighting, not in a single moments comfrontation with reality.<br />
<br />
Sadly, the stories achilles heel lies in the constrains of simbolysm it chose to delve into. You just can&#039;t igonore the hint&#039;s so blatantly put in your face and make assumtions on face value alone. It isin&#039;t inovative by any means to make an long lasting impression to the mass media consummers, but as a standalone story it has enough quality for people that like character driven stories.<br />

<br />
As a fan of NisiOisiN it is uncomfortable to write this review. I still can not believe that Juuni Taisen, an anime based on his novel, could be so mediocre.<br />
<br />
And the worst thing is that at the beginning it looked promising. Everything seemed to point to this anime would be avant-garde to break with the clichés of the formula &quot;Battle Royale&quot;; however, episode after episode,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269041">
        Juuni Taisen was transformed into a mess unable to maintain interest.<br />
 <br />
Some characters so one-dimensional that, with some exceptions, it was impossible to connect with them; and a plot that folded to a totally predictable formula, killed any kind of suspense or mystery possible. In case anyone did not notice, the order of the deaths was the inverse of the order of the Chinese zodiac; and if that was very difficult to guess, the ending showed the sequence in all the episodes.<br />
<br />
In addition, what was initially innovative and unexpected, soon became a heavy and insipid structure. I mean the formula of showing a character&#039;s background right before he died. I have to admit, that even in the final episode itself I expected a plot twist that would justify everything, but no, that salvation never came.<br />
<br />
It is supposed that the subject of this type of series is that each death is unexpected and that it is never known who will win until the end; nevertheless, Juuni Taisen decided to remove that suspense from the middle to focus on making a veiled criticism of the war?<br />
<br />
The problem with that is that without suspense it is difficult to maintain interest. Not to mention that the characters have hardly any development and it is extremely difficult to empathize with them; not only because of its poor construction, but because just at the moment they develop a little they end up dying.<br />
<br />
And in the midst of that scenario, do you want to teach us that war is bad? Using cheap self-help book philosophy? With this panorama it was inevitable that this series would fail. A pity that a work of a great like NisiOisiN ends up happening without pain or glory.<br />
<br />
Of course, as in everything, there are exceptions, for example the Ox and the Tigress were two of the rescue characters; unfortunately they did not have more minutes on the screen. The rat could be another prominent character, especially for those last two episodes; however, his absence during more than 75% of the series made him lose all the weight he could potentially have.<br />
<br />
Finally, the resolution was totally anticlimactic, which did not help at all to improve the series. Only the issue of desire in the final episode was a bit like raising the quality a little; however, in the end even that was handled horribly.<br />
<br />
For that desire to forget everything had had an impact, it was necessary that the rat had more weight during the 12 episodes; If the audience had suffered their pain while living each path, for example, they would have had more connection with the boy and his predicament.<br />
<br />
On the technical section. The soundtrack only has the opening to highlight, but it is not to launch rockets; the rest of the music is totally forgettable. The animation started well, but soon it went to the floor, leaving a lot to be desired in the process.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the direction was frightening in every minute. There were hardly two or three sequences to remember and it was not because they had been first level, but because everything else gave pity. Character design is the only thing to be highlighted within the technical section; Here I must say that a very good job was done.<br />
<br />
In short, a series that disappointed with a mediocre execution of a premise with enormous potential. If you have not seen it, do not even come near it. See you in the next review.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
A series with a huge potential that went to hell for a mediocre execution.<br />
<br />
Personal rating<br />
<br />
4/10<br />

    I have observed some mixed opinions about Juuni Taisen (Zodiac War) during its airtime. Like that the plot is weak, it´s predictable, the fights are boring, the deaths are stupid, and the characters are scumbags with no development. And from the other side that it´s actually quite good, even great. That the characters are fairly interesting, with as much focus on their past, (with some interesting stories) as the actually death game. In my review I will give you my point of view on this, and how I perceived the whole show. <br />
<br />
I wouldn´t call the plot weak, just narrow. The premises are a death

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265595">
        battle in 24 hours, based on the Twelve Zodiacs Hours. According to Chinese astrology, though not popularly used, a person’s personality and life is more decided by his/her birth hour than year. So instead for each animal sign belonging to a specific sequence of years, it depends on which hour of the day you were born. Which is the case with the narrative of Juuni Tasien. Which explains the otherwise kind of weird age span of the characters, and how that is that dragon and snake can be twins. Knowing that is not a spoiler, whatever you google on it or not can be doe. In my point of view, Juuni Taisen delivered what it promised. You get to know why these battles are hold (whatever you find it interesting or believable is up to you), what the participants and organizers gain from it, and the battle setup. So, to me the plot isn´t weak, just very straight forward and narrow. <br />
<br />
The show is predictable to some extent, but just as much it isn´t (don´t get fooled by the first 3-episode pattern). Yes, there are a major spoiler for who is going to die next included in the show, but not how and when they die. If you can live with that, this won´t be a problem for you. <br />
<br />
Since many probably signed up for Juuni Taisen due to the action tag, there is somethings that can be good to know in advance. The fights are short, intense, consume little airtime, and not your typically anime type of fights. You know, the type that can last a half of an episode, with the participants taking an immense amount of punishment, just for them to rise up again and keep fighting because of their “strong determination and will”. You aren’t going to find any of this in Juuni Taisen. The fights, battles and strategies in Juuni Taisen are a bit more “realistic”. Read me right, nothing about JT is quite realistic, but in the manor of how they play out. <br />
<br />
Let me clarify by Mike Tyson´s famous quote; “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face”. Which much align with how it works in Juuni Taisen. The characters are scheming, plotting, and planning, but as in real life, things seldom unfolds according to plan. There are factors that you forget to take in count, the misreading of a situation or opponent, the overestimation of your own abilities, or the underestimation of the opponent´s. The fights themselves is in my opinion often pretty interesting and nicely executed, I enjoyed them a lot, much due to what I mentioned above. You could clearly make out what of the things I mentioned above, went wrong when a character lost.<br />
<br />
Which leads me to the deaths. One might call some of them stupid, but I would call them human. The characters are often finding themselves in a situation where they get surprised, overwhelmed or hesitate a second to long, and end up dead because of it. If that isn´t typically human traits, I don´t know what is. Even the strongest, bravest, most experienced man can crack under too much mental pressure, which JT displays well. And the participants are for sure under much mental pressure, they are after all in a time limited death battle with only one winner outcome. If that doesn´t for fill your desire for “cool” deaths, well you may want to watch something else. <br />
As for the characters being scumbags, is absolutely partly true. A number of characters are really some of the worst scum the human race can offer, and some are far from it. With that said, I didn´t find any of the characters boring, quite the opposite. I found the depraved characters just as interesting as the rest. It´s a question of balance, and there did JT also delivered, its got the whole span of personalities. <br />
<br />
About the character development, let me first ask you a question. How much do you develop as a person during 24 hours? I myself, can say, that I probably doesn´t develop significantly much during that span of time. So, don´t expect any revolutionary character developments, this is the type of show that focuses more on how characters will act after their current state in life. <br />
<br />
Which leads me to how the characters are handle together with the story. The plot can thoroughly be divided into two sets. Set one being the battle occurring in present time, and set two being the backgrounds of the characters, with set one and two mixing together from the start to the end. I liked the concept, which gave information about certain characters along the way, and at the same time pieced together their current place in the battle, or filled out the narrow plot with some good context. That made them feel more like persons then just war-robots. Tiger´s story was especially touching, and when put in with her role in the battle, it actually accounts as development for me. There´s a fair amount of time spent on dialogues and inner monologues, which let´s you get to know the characters and how they think. For the little time 12 characters have in just 12-episodes, I think most of them where quite fleshed out.<br />
<br />
The opening song &quot;Rupture&quot; by Panorama Panama Town, is in my opinion the best OP this season. The song and visuals are capturing the atmosphere of JT really well, and set me in the perfect mode for an episode. The ending song &quot;Keshin no Kemono&quot; by Do As Infinity, is equally as good, which round up that episode by showcasing the civil side of the warriors. The VA´s are well matched with their characters, and all preform their role to satisfaction. <br />
<br />
Overall the art and animation holds a high quality. Nice coloured and detailed backgrounds, fluent and intense action scenes, cool character designs, and fitting light settings. There are some parts where the quality drops (running out of budget?), but those scenes are pretty rare. <br />
<br />
So, conclusion time. Juuni Tasien surprised me, and drew me in much more then I had expected. I enjoyed every episode, predictable or not. Some of the backstories were more touching than what one might expect for this type of show, and somewhat humanized the warriors a bit. I recommend this show to everyone who can live with the conditions I mentioned in this review, and won´t expect something similar to the Fate-series. The plot base is the same, but everything else has a completely different vibe. <br />
<br />
Enjoy your watch!  <br />

    The premise is like Fate zero, the animation is good, another than that there&#039;s nothing good. i didnt feel like I connected with the characters and apparently, some of the strongest competitors are weak and die so fast. it felt completely random who was going to die(with some exceptions) and most of the reasons for the death were completely stupid(i.e out of carelessness and honestly I think that&#039;s how most if not how most people died so far). I watched until ep 7). Also like the most helpful post said they just kill everyone then spit out of exposition(either before or after they die), it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263347">
        barely lets you connect with the character if you even did connect with the character.

    A show that could be much better if had at least 24 episodes:<br />
<br />
Things that i like:<br />
+The opening<br />
+Some characters designs<br />

+Some parts of episode 10<br />
Things that i don&#039;t like:<br />
-Too much flashbacks<br />
-Some episodes are predictable <br />
-Bad animation in most episodes<br />
-Rushed battles.<br />
-The twins are boring and they have TWO episodes of flashbacks.<br />

Also the series could be better if they explain more about the presentator of the game that we never know where come from. Whose are those people that are betting for the game?

    I never thought I would write a review, but here I am. I am writing this because too few people seem to get what this series is about.<br />
First of all, I have to say that if you only like action-comedy shounens, this is not a series for you. If you want just a lot of fight scenes and plot twists, watch something else.<br />
Now, let me explain why I liked Juuni Taisen.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Well, all the characters die in the expected order, and there aren&#039;t any major plot twists. In each episode, we get some backstory, a bit of fighting (I will talk about that later) and usually

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267315">
        a death. However, I can say that the backstories are well written. Not even one of them tries to be too tragic, and the characters vary from pacifists to thieves and psychopaths. However, most of them contain some tragedy, and some of them really touched my heart. I even cried once, which I really didn&#039;t expect to happen when I was watching this series.<br />
<br />
Action:<br />
The action isn&#039;t really a focal part of this show, but the animation is really well done. However, I was more impressed by a thing you don&#039;t really see anywhere else. In general, there are two types of fights: the classic direct power clash and the more indirect fights in which the opponents try to analyze the opponent&#039;s unique power ( the activation conditions, limits and weaknesses) and try to find a smart way to win. Juuni Taisen looks at first like it belongs to the second class, but it has a surprising element of realism added to the battles: almost all of the plans DON&#039;T work. And they end up failing for some really simple reasons that the characters just overlooked. <br />
For some, it may sound anti-climactic, but I thought it was awesome how this anime showed just how quickly a life can end in battle.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack:<br />
Well, I don&#039;t really know much about music, but I enjoyed the op, and the rest of the music was pretty good. Not one of the best, but good.<br />
<br />
Negative points:<br />
I liked this anime from the beginning and around episode 10 I was thinking I might just give it a 10/11 (11 being the masterpieces). However, the last episode was just unsatisfying. Most of the people who are reading this are probably going to ignore my advice, but I am going to say it anyway: DON&#039;T watch the last episode. Just pretend ep 11 is the conclusion. That is going to be much better. Or, at least, stop at the half point and imagine yourself what the winner asked for. I am going to say this again: DON&#039;T watch the last episode till the end. I mean, I get what the point of the last episode was supposed to be, but there is a huge difference between understanding what you were supposed to feel, and actually feeling it.<br />
<br />
Overall, I give this anime a personal 9/11 and a recommendation to watch it only if you think you will enjoy it in the way that I described it.<br />
You can watch it legally for free on Crunchyroll.

    If you were given one wish to have anything you want, what would you choose?<br />
<br />
This is the question our 12 combatants have over their heads as they try to survive in this battle royale anime where only one can survive. It is the formula that been used in many battle royale anime and so it also applies here. Who will win? Who will lose? But, most importantly, who will get the longest backstory? <br />
<br />
So sit back, relax and &quot;Everybody, clap your hands!&quot; as I present to you the anime review for Juuni Taisen. Lets begin: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10 <br />
<br />
So like I said, the anime is about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265716">
        the Juuni Taisen. A battle royale where 12 combatants compete to kill off each other in order to win the prize of having one wish of their desires; that&#039;s about it. Honestly you don&#039;t need to have a complex story for a premise that is this simple. You are given the premise and then you move on to see what happens next. It is the kind of story that develops depending on the actions of the characters and what they do to survive. <br />
<br />
Now one of the things that Juuni Taisen does that I like is that there is no true protagonist. Almost every character gets the light shine on them for an episode or two and we get to see how they plan to win the Juuni Taisen what actions they are planning to make. We also get to see what actions they took before they entered the Juuni Taisen to get an idea of kind of character they are in backsotries. The problem is that they can be inconsistent in terms of actually being interesting and length. While some are enjoyable to watch, some of them can be kind of boring. It doesn&#039;t help that sometimes that the backstories can take an entire episode to just tell us the lives of these characters and their morals. This doesn&#039;t help when you get these long backstories and then they get killed off quickly, leaving the viewer disappointment due to it feeling anticlimactic. This is mainly due to the mistakes that the characters make but more on that later. <br />
<br />
Juuni Taisen also likes to portray the battle royale as a literal war. The city that the anime is based in is a battlefield with soldiers in it; fighting each other in order to survive. Not to win, but to survive. Because by the end of the anime you get the message that there are no winners in war, only survivors. That is exactly what Juuni Taisen is trying to portray. It&#039;s not trying to be Fate or Future Diary, it is trying to be Juuni Taisen. But the message can be difficult to understand because the characters aren&#039;t really grounded in reality when they can do supernatural things that no normal human could, making it difficult to see that message. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 8/10 <br />
<br />
One of the best things Juuni Taisen gets right is that it understands that a battle royale anime needs to have a diverse set of characters and thankfully it does. Juuni Taisen has a large variety in characters all representing an animal in the Chinese Zodiac Line. From the weird dressing but psychotic nature of Rabbit to the calm and collective nature of Ox to the carefree but kindhearted Tiger. These characters are interesting to watch and makes for good entertainment when their personalities clash together.....most of the time. Some characters can be one dimensional and uninteresting to watch, making their expected deaths less shocking. I&#039;m not going to say who due to spoilers but they can be uninteresting. <br />
<br />
Now like I said earlier, their deaths are mainly caused by their mistakes because in war, you can&#039;t make mistakes otherwise you are dead. You make a mistake, you die, simple as that. This is something people tend to gloss over without thinking because it is an important factor. They can die because they were overconfident or they can die because they let their guard down. A couple of mistakes do happen multiple times but mainly they die because of the mistake they specifically made. However I do believe that the characters can still make these mistakes and still put on some good fights. There was only a couple of fights in the anime that were noteworthy as the rest ended very quickly. I think that it is a waste considering what these characters can do. These characters can control birds, levitate for no reason, see into different world lines (get it?) and resurrect the dead. It just feels wasteful and I believe that if the anime is not going to be really using all these abilities to the fullest, then they should have more grounded characters. It would certainly make its message about war more easy to understand. <br />
<br />
<br />
Animation: 6.5/10 <br />
<br />
Now the overall animation can be rather inconsistent. But I must give credit where credit is due though, the fight scenes that are in the anime are well animated, especially in the earlier episodes. There is a lot of smooth action in them, especially since some of them are noticeably animated in 3D, making them an enjoyment to watch. The 3D animation doesn&#039;t hinder it and won&#039;t bother many people since its mainly animated in the standard 2D animation anyway. <br />
<br />
However the character designs, while being unique to represent their animal in the Chinese Zodiac line, are rather poorly animated. Most of the time they look like they&#039;ve been poorly drawn as there are notable black lines in their designs, making them lack detail and look sloppy. This happens a lot in this anime and you will notice it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 7.5/10<br />
<br />
The soundtrack most of the time didn&#039;t really stand out besides a couple of tracks at specific times. Most of the time it plays to itself to match the atmosphere and tone at that moment.  However I do want to give credit the OP and ED of this show. The opening, &quot;Rupture&quot; Panorama Panama Town is quite possibly one of my favourite OP this year. It has a nice calm rhythm and beat that you don&#039;t normally here in an anime opening. It matches the anime well as it is not really explosive and is trying to be different than other openings. However, its ending song, &quot;Keshin no Kemono&quot; by Do As Infinity, is the complete opposite. Its fast and loud which, again, is the complete opposite of what many other anime ED songs matches the anime well because because like the anime, it is trying to be different. <br />
<br />
I also want to give very quick praise to the dub as I do believe the voice actors do good jobs of capturing the characters personalities well. I specifically like Jerry Jewell as Usagi/Rabbit. While the Japanese voice actor makes Rabbit sound creepy, He makes Rabbit sound quirky and sometimes humorous which I like. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 6.8/10 Recommendation: &quot;Consider it&quot; <br />
<br />
Like I said, this show isn&#039;t trying to be Fate or Future Diary, it&#039;s trying to be Juuni Taisen. It wants to be its own thing and I respect it for it. This show is trying to portray the message that &quot;War is hell&quot; in the wise words of Jim Carry and it wants people to understand that. If you are looking for a show like Fate then you won&#039;t find it here but if you looking for something different in a battle royale anime then it is worth checking out. It is only 12 episodes long so it won&#039;t take you too long to watch.
