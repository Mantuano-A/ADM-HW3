    We have a new candidate for most polarizing anime of all time. There appears to be no middle ground on this one. You will either absolutely love this or your reaction will be that there is a special place in hell for whoever dreamed this one up.<br />
<br />
I have devised a fool-proof test for whether you&#039;ll like this show or not. The results are based on your reaction to this joke:<br />
<br />
Question: Why did Salvador Dali&#039;s chicken cross the road? Answer: A fish, m*therf**ker.<br />
<br />
If you found that joke to be funny, you&#039;ll enjoy this show and I am happy for you. For everyone else I&#039;m reminded of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270123">
        the description of the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. Watching this show is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick. If only I knew some voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate afterward. Note that your enjoyment of this show has nothing whatever to do with your intelligence; only with what you find funny. If you are one of those folks who finds train wrecks mind-numbingly funny, then this is the show for you. For everyone else, you&#039;ll be better spending your time elsewhere.<br />
<br />
The art is intentionally poor. There is no story; just seemingly random, and I use the term loosely, gags.<br />
<br />
I set a new personal record for time spent before dropping a series. I did force myself to suffer through additional episodes just to get this review accepted.

    [Pop Culture References + Meme + Anime = Pop Team Epic]<br />
<br />
[Alternative Title – Memes, References, and High Quality Shitpost: the anime]<br />
<br />
*Part 1 of Review*<br />
<br />
(For those curious about this series, read this review):<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
<br />
Story? Who needs a story. Can’t have a story, if you never had one. It’s just random shit happening on screen because that’s how Pop Team Epic rolls. The series features a variety of humor, ranging from black comedy (i.e. gallows humor – my favorite type of humor) to surreal humor to anti-humor, and to meta-jokes and parodies.<br />
<br />
The series features many pop culture references, such as: Earth, Wind &amp;amp; Fire, Pokémon, Hoshiiro Girldrop, Kimi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277885">
        no Na wa, Chrono Trigger, Kemono Friends, My Neighbour Totoro, Metal Gear Solid 3 time paradox, Top Gun, Initial D, Hellshake Yano, YouTube subscribe, Undertale, Donkey Kong, the Shawshank Redemption, etc.<br />
<br />
I love how each episode has one long skit, such as sports anime (shogi/racing), science-fiction, murder-mystery, music, haunted house horror, romances, music documentary, etc, and manages to turn it into a parody. Loved every moment of it!<br />
<br />
Especially, the entire Hellshake Yano sequence, in Episode 7; it was amazing and outstanding, considering everything was told through art sketches and the actors actually performing it on live camera. Glorious stuff!<br />
<br />
Other original skits include: Bob Epic Team shorts with the main character’s face and body being distorted as hell, Japon Mignon shorts, live action actors and actresses, Pop Team Cooking shorts, POP TEAM 8-BIT, Pop Team Dance, etc. Every single skits was amazing, and well told and executed. I laugh at every single joke, reference, and parody, they displayed on the screen.<br />
<br />
Each episode contains two similar-looking 12-minute segments that feature different voice actors and other small changes to the skits. I think this idea is extremely unique and makes the anime stand out more compared to other anime series.<br />
<br />
It may be a strange, bizarre, and even crazy, but this series allows numerous animators and content creators to have their creations shown on every medium, such as internet or television. It allows creativity to flow and flourish without any restrictions. And finally, it&#039;s not afraid to do what it wants to do. It just does it, and rolls with it!<br />
<br />
ANIMATION:<br />
<br />
Solid animations. Some of the skits come from the original comic strips, however the majority of them are original animations. The animators make use of a variety types of animations, such as fully 3D animations, CGI, 2D animations, live-action, stop-motion, and idiosyncratic animation from the AC-bu.<br />
<br />
For example, Kamikaze Douga is the primary animation studio that does 3D animation as well as the Hoshiiro Girldrop shorts; Space Neko Company does the 2D animations and “Pop Team Story&quot; shorts, i.e. the shorts that reference from the original comic; AC-bu does the idiosyncratic animations for “Bob Epic Team&quot; short; UchuPeople produces stop-motion animation for “Pop Team Dance” shorts.<br />
<br />
The animation may be bizarre, especially the idiosyncratic animations (i.e. distorted characters, background objects, and even strange fast-paced animations), it may be realistic (i.e. live-action, or the stop motion animations), or it may be crazy, but who cares, this is Pop Team Epic, where the crazy becomes even crazier.<br />
<br />
Excellent character models. Seeing Popuko and Pipimi being drawn in a variety of styles is interesting and dynamic.<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
<br />
Excellent voice acting. The anime incorporates many voice actors and actresses to voice both Popuko and Pipimi. The voice actors for Popuko includes: Masashi Ebara, Yūji Mitsuya, Aoi Yūki, Toshio Furukawa, Yōko Hikasa, Tesshō Genda, Nana Mizuki, Hozumi Gōda, etc. The voice actors/actresses for Pipimi includes Hōchū Ōtsuka, Noriko Hidaka, Ayana Taketatsu, Shigeru Chiba, Mamiko Noto, Banjō Ginga, etc. Then, we have french actor/actress, such as Fanny Bloc and Christine Bellier. I believe having many voice actors/actress changes thing up and makes it exciting, fun, and enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Every voice actor/actresses fits their roles and makes everything funnier. The male voice actors make everything twice as funny, especially when they sing songs and create exaggerated sound effects.<br />
<br />
Excellent opening song (i.e. “Pop Team Epic”) by Sumire Uesaka, so good you get to hear it twice. Also, the first episode’s opening song, titled “Twinkling Star” by Yui Ogura, Inori Minase, and Sumire Uesaka was also really good. The kick-ass opening sets the tone for the rest of the series. Excellent background music sets the mood, atmosphere, and tone for the characters and reactions to specific situations, whether it’s comedy, mystery, drama, etc. The song, “Let’s Pop Together” is an excellent parody of “Let’s Groove” by Earth, Wind &amp;amp; Fire.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER:<br />
<br />
Excellent characters that are funny and entertaining to watch. Background stories, character development, and even goals and motivations be damned; you know why you are watching this, and it’s not for “great character development or background stories”. It’s to watch two characters, Popuko and Pipimi, do crazy skits and perform hilarious jokes. I just love how Popuko and Pipimi are able to bounce jokes after jokes off each other.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
<br />
I smiled and laughed during every single episode. It doesn’t matter what other people say, just watch for shits and giggles.<br />
<br />
Pop Team Epic is one of greatest show I ever watched in 2018.<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
Change my mind.<br />

    (Why the hell would you need a TLDR review?)<br />
<br />
It has come to my attention that Pop Team Epic is excruciatingly misunderstood. <br />
-----<br />
<br />
Pop Team Epic<br />
<br />
In this review, I coded it so that I have to speedrun my Pop Team Epic review before MAL has a 504 Error. Can I finish my review before MAL goes down?<br />

Does Pop Team Epic actually try

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365688">
        to be comedy 🤣 god 🙏 ? Well yes, but actually yes. However, one could look at Pop team Epic as more than just some gag anime. It is a way of life. The a(pog)ee (who tf makes these words) of being the most based anime known to man. I really can&#039;t explain with words of the centre of everything Pop Team Epic tries to convey to the viewer. But I will try to do so with this review, not only with words alone, I will try to deliver the feeling you get via this review. The ascendance of Pop Team Epic knows no limits. Look at today&#039;s mainstream anime, shitty isekai here, overhyped shounen anime there, bruh Crunchyroll Originals moment, other things no one asked for. But Pop Team Epic is more than that. It is on a platform of its own. Imagine the first episode of NGNL, you know, that one time Sora and Shiro were 2gud4dez nubz that they rekt them in like 2 seconds lmao. That is where Pop Team Epic stands in the animanga culture. And honestly, I have quite never seen anything as supreme as Pop Team Epic. Apart from my simping on Madoka Magica. Pop Team Epic is hands down the best thing this 　ｂ　ｒ　ｕ　ｈ　 medium has to give.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
ɔıdƎ ɯɐǝ⊥ doԀ<br />
<br />
Narrative:<br />
Story? Lmao. There is none. It is just shits and giggles here, there, everywhere. What I will say is that the larger segments, the ones by Space Cat Company, does provide for some top quality shorts. A wide variety of just random, though creative things slapped together to make for some interesting shorts. And you can probably tell that I am running out of things to say, because it mostly comes under enjoyment lmao.<br />

bruh de vizual lukin lit, very variety all around and vry good. dey uze rl and animu. very creativity honestly, anime nowadays sticking to unbased and 🤢🤢. But Pop Team Epic no hold back, they will use everything from drawings that looked like they came out of The Amazing World of Gumball fanfics, to the beautiful comsic-like humans that bring a fallacious vision of one looking into one of Leonardo da Vinci&#039;s works.<br />

<br />
Ears side of things, ngl, didn&#039;t remember any sound lmao, that is in terms of OST, if there was one to begin with, I have no clue. The main sounds did not disappoint, oh no siree, the super catchy OP and parody of Hoshiiro Girldrop sounds. Not to mention the based song that is &quot;Let&#039;s Pop Together&quot;, literally has some of the best lyrics I have heard seen since just when I watched it. Bruh, why isn&#039;t all anime like this, smh.<br />

Jouissance:<br />
<br />
Une petite chose que je voulais ajouter, c’est que l’anime permet à une variété vide de personnes d’en profiter, de Français personnes, aux mêmes, aux fans d’anime. Pourquoi c’est en Français. Je n’en ai aucune idée. Je ne peux que demander la déité derrière Pop Team Epic que de chercher une telle réponse. Merci à Collins traducteur pour cette tranlastion. <br />

<br />
In addition to the multiple languages that the anime uses. It also has some very clever ways to bring out enjoyment. The first thing being parody. Undertale, Super Mario Kart, using Wikipedia as a source, Jojo references, and YouTubers when they tell you to SMASH THE LIKE BUTTON FOR MORE, and reaction videos. Pop Team Epic never seems to run out of this to, well, things to take the piss out of, kinda like South Park but maybe not as outrageous. And it does it so casually as well. It again enforces how much the anime literally does not give one about the internet opinions of someone who happens to pass by the show. It just what it needs to do, and no one will stop it.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
ᴾᵒᵖ ᵀᵉᵃᵐ ᴱᵖⁱᶜ<br />
<br />
Another thing to say about the enjoyment is that the anime already knows its position in life. So many times has it referred to itself as the &quot;shitty manga&quot; saying things like &quot;why did this get an anime&quot;. Using my reddit r/funny knowledge it is clear that they are just parodying the unepic haters so much so that it just makes for more good content to add onto the gags the show already had going from the start. Who would have thought that the juxtaposition of using the haters mindset made for a good piece of farming jokes out of.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
𝘗𝘰𝘱𝘶𝘵𝘦𝘱𝘪𝘱𝘪𝘬𝘬𝘶<br />
<br />
And well, the last pillar of enjoyment I have to go on about with Pop Team Epic is just the sheer amount of absurd moments that literally don&#039;t add anything to the plot that doesn&#039;t even exist. Kinda like Family Guy&#039;s cutaways but it does it better. Way better. One moment they are taking the piss out of haters, the next is just some surreal humour that breaks all sense of logic. As well as this, there is the greatness of parodying the romance genre. Not sure why they chose romance but they did. And it goes a little like<br />

But fr. The nonsense moments are just some of the most bizarre but well put together shitposts I have seen in a long while. More anime needs to take a page from Pop Team Epic&#039;s book. All in all. It is clear that everything was focused around the enjoyment part rather than trying to make very deep psychological story is very deep. Outstanding move.<br />
<br />
Overall - 💯<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know why it suddenly came to mind to write a review like this but it did. Straying away from the general MAL format of writing a review is just kinda what Pop Team Epic acts like within the anime medium as an anime, just felt that this was the best way to bring that around with words and layout. It goes to limits no one is willing to take, even if very serious people will watch this. Everything I said is actually my opinion. No cap. This is unironically one of the best things I have seen. Being that eccentric person isn&#039;t always a bad thing. 10/10. <br />
<br />
For anyone wondering, it took 1h 42m 7s to write this from after the first sentence to the overall score. And I have no intention to properly proofread this review.<br />
<br />
Fall in love next week!<br />

    There are certain anime series that get you wondering &quot;what the actual frigging hell am I watching&quot;...Pop Team Epic is an epitome of that kind of series. Even though it is meant to be a shitposting kind of series, shitposting doesn&#039;t actually mean good comedy (I&#039;ll go into a bit more detail about that in my review). It had me to the point where I was questioning even why this became an anime series in the first place. I&#039;ll be frank with this, even though I&#039;m probably gonna anger some crazy fans: this thing is actually qualified as TRASH.<br />
I&#039;ll try to be brief with this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274832">
        review, cause even with just reviews, it&#039;s hard to really input anything decent about this series.<br />
<br />
STORY: Story? Plot? HAHA, what plot? What story? In pretty much every decent to great series, you need to have some sort of story or settings implemented. Pop Team Epic had none of the sort...to me, at least, it is basically the Japanese version of Robot Chicken, but much worse. The parodies, skits, references, whatever the joke may be...that&#039;s ALL there really is to this series. Oh yeah, about the Hoshiro Girldrop tease and then the hi-jacking, it IS funny, I&#039;ll admit, but for the most part, it&#039;s just one cringy joke after another, and honestly, that kind of stuff can get bland after a while. When people tell me this series is very philosophical, I think it&#039;s more so of how it gets you thinking philosophically as to why this series is one of the most absurd things you&#039;d have ever watched. <br />
<br />
ART: I don&#039;t really have much to say about the art other than the fact it&#039;s the kind of art (excluding some parts) that you&#039;d see in anime specials/shorts or in those wacky-looking Western cartoons. The chibi looks and all that for the two main characters, though...doesn&#039;t make them look any good whatsoever. I guess it&#039;s sorta okayish, but barely anyone is really gonna praise it or even be attentive to it, anyway.<br />
<br />
SOUND: Well, not much to say about it. I will admit that some of the ending themes were done pretty well, but for the most part, whatever soundtracks are featured will depend on the respective joke or parody, and even then are very subpar and mediocre at best.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: So the main characters here: a yellow haired shortie that gets easily triggered (sometimes for no reason) and a blue haired lanky quiet girl. Popuko and Pipimi are just really there with their rather contrasting personalities to set up each joke and play it out in the most absurd and ridiculous of fashions. Knowing that, I don&#039;t see how one can really like them as a character in general. The only way one would be able to like any of them is for the fact that they are at least the perfect fit, in terms of their personality, to make the jokes as outrageous as possible.<br />
As for character development...considering what this &quot;series&quot; is, there is none, and none needed. The supporting cast? Really depends on what the joke/parody/reference/gag is, honestly. The only truly recurring members are the ones that are part of the Hoshiro Girldrop skit, that&#039;s about it.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: Now here&#039;s the part I really want to try to make clear. My level of enjoyment is usually mid-ground, but it purely depends on the jokes with each different episode. I do want to point out early that each episode is really just two copies of the same stuff placed together in the same 30 min timeframe...so it&#039;s more like 12-15 of just ridiculousness followed by another 12-15 minutes of the exact same damn thing...it&#039;s as if the staff thinks we can&#039;t get enough of it, for pete sakes.<br />
I personally couldn&#039;t find myself really entertained after the first episode...in fact, the jokes eventually felt dry and bland, or just straight up cringe that doesn&#039;t turn out funny to me. Honestly, I&#039;d get more kick out of watching classic Western/American cartoons or live TV shows where they have a similar sort of format, but a better display of hilarity and jokes. In short, enjoyment level for this series REALLY depends on how funny or stupid the comedy is, and for me, it&#039;s middle-ground. <br />
<br />
OVERALL: Beware, as this series can be a mentally exhausting experience. Honestly, this is a kind of series that people would only support for the lols (OR LOL attempts). Even the artist contributions don&#039;t even really have much worth for it at all. Even Futurama, Family Guy, and American Dad actually had much better examples of random (though mostly inappropriate) comedy.<br />
As one who has suffered them and survived to tell the tale, I advise one with their sanity still intact to just avoid this like a god damn plague....however, if that you&#039;re THAT bored to where you&#039;re only entertained by ridiculousness and absurdity, I guess this series may fit your bill, but even then, you may eventually find it boring if the jokes don&#039;t rub you the right way. Granted, at least it&#039;s not something like Ousama Game, Boku no Pico, School Days, or Mars of Destruction.<br />
And on that note, my rant of this &quot;series&quot; is done.

    *This review will mention a number of jokes from the series, mostly in vague terms to minimize spoilers while still offering a point of reference to those who have already seen it*<br />
<br />
As soon as I committed to watching Poputepipikku (Pop Team Epic), I knew immediately that I wanted to talk about it, whether by discussing it with others or, as I have now done, writing a full review of this strange beast. It was clear that my opinion on it was different from the prevailing thoughts of the community. Of course that’s not a bad thing; differences of opinion or perspective make such discussions far

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274997">
        more interesting, as opposed to a circle of like-minded cult members all chanting “Yes, man! Yes, man!” in rhythmic turn.<br />
<br />
Of course, in the case of Pop Team Epic, the scenario looks more as if half the members in the circle suddenly turned to demons, the song of the ring an increasingly loud and aggressive “No, idiot!” with both sides on the verge of slaughtering each other. Pop Team Epic is an unbelievably, viciously polarizing show, with outcries of love and hatred struggling for dominance. What could possibly make something so divisive? It&#039;s hard to say for sure, outside of the old saying that comedy is subjective, but it may have something to do with the show’s unorthodox nature and format. Put simply, there’s little else quite like Pop Team Epic, for better or worse. The closest reference point I can imagine would be parody sketch comedies like Robot Chicken, but even this fails to truly capture the format-stretching, meme-generating, self-aware surrealism on display here.<br />
<br />
So, with little comparison to go on, and a product which in many ways defies traditional metrics, it’s easy to become dismissive - to take your first, most basic impression of a title like Pop Team Epic and jump to conclusions about the work as a whole, whether positive or negative. I&#039;ll openly admit I did exactly this when I first saw the premiere episode, believing it to exist primarily to troll its audience (which it certainly does at times, but I&#039;d hardly call it the show&#039;s sole purpose). Other stances span the full range from &quot;hilarious collection of memes about pop culture&quot; to &quot;insufferable unfunny barrage of nonsensical randomness to amuse the bottom-feeders of the internet&quot; among others - and to be clear, I&#039;m not saying these specific stances are invalid or necessarily arise from quick dismissal. But if we&#039;re not careful, there&#039;s the risk of getting swept up in our immediate reactions and forgetting about the craft behind them - of losing perspective of the elements that go into the work as a whole to make it what it is. Pop Team Epic may come off as strange at times, but I believe like all media, it still deserves acknowledgement as an art piece, regardless of one&#039;s overall experience with it or eventual stance reached regarding its quality.<br />
<br />
So here we are, as I make a serious attempt at understanding this show’s vision and the tools it uses to pursue it, and then deciding whether or not I liked what I saw and why. All this, because I don&#039;t think a work like this should see its weird, experimental nature become an excuse to immediately write off its craft before at least giving an honest and open look at the content on display.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, there IS still the question of whether I personally liked it, so without further ado, I present my honest thoughts on this little oddity:<br />
<br />
Pop Team Epic is an absurdist sketch comedy starring Popuko and Pipimi, two recurring avatars who go around making all variety of over-the-top events happen, all while screwing with as many characters as possible, including the viewer watching it. It sets itself apart from other such comedies by embracing the concept of meta-humour, but in ways that are far more creative and interesting than the often-seen approach of simply breaking the fourth wall and calling attention to its tropes (some may know this as “lampshading”). It also consistently gets creative with its formatting, whether subverting the standard 4-panel setup in various ways to enhance the element of surprise in its jokes, or making use of many alternative formats and styles to keep the variety up. Perhaps most critically, while wildly inconsistent in terms of quality, it shows an ability to tell its jokes without falling into common pitfalls of non sequitur and referential comedies… most of the time.<br />
<br />
That last point is one I’d like to emphasize. Personally, I see more in this show&#039;s sense of humour than just arbitrary references for arbitrary references’ sake, and this is coming from someone who typically isn’t fond of non sequitur comedies. To explain why I feel this way, I feel it is helpful to try and break down why exactly I find randomness played for laughs to be ineffectual, as well as a bit about “humour” in general - hopefully, without coming off as conceited; it’s no secret that comedy is a highly subjective affair, so take everything I&#039;m about to say not as any sorts of &quot;rules&quot; for comedy, but rather, as an elaboration for why I find Pop Team Epic to work where so many others fail, leveraging my understanding of my personal sense of humour while still respecting the skill displayed by the content at hand.<br />
<br />
There are many theories out there which attempt to explain what makes something funny, but one that generally seems to align with my own sense of humour, and a useful starting point here, is Peter McGraw’s Benign Violation Theory. Those interested in the study of humour are free to explore this and other theories, but to avoid needlessly padding this review, I’ll stick to what’s relevant here: it suggests that something will be funny if it simultaneously a) acts as a violation of what a person believes an aspect of the world “ought to be”, and b) be presented in a benign (safe/non-threatening) manner. That&#039;s rather abstract, so to make a somewhat more concrete extension of this in the context of anime, one could theoretically achieve this by in some way surprising a viewer - such as by setting up expectations for the show or its universe and then defy them with some kind of “punchline”, joke, whatever - but in a way such that the result is something the viewer won’t find offensive, annoying, upsetting and so forth. Of course, this will vary from viewer to viewer. This is only one approach and not a perfect explanation by any stretch, nor are these anything close the only variables which may be involved. But it&#039;s a helpful springboard for diving into this show&#039;s content.<br />
<br />
Applying this idea to non sequitur humour, if something incredibly out of place suddenly shows up in a show’s universe, then you’ve defied the viewer’s expectations for that universe, so you might get a laugh once or twice. But by repeating this joke, once it’s been established that weird or arbitrary things can and will happen in this universe, you lose that element of surprise for any future irregular occurrences, and the effect is lost. Worse still, if everything is completely random, without some thread of logic or flow to latch onto, viewers may stop expecting anything aside from this randomness. And, if you keep showing non sequitur after non sequitur, and the viewer interprets that as the joke, it could get incredibly obnoxious.<br />
<br />
One could also say similar things for referential humour; the first reference is an unexpected intrusion on the show’s universe originating from another, but if you keep throwing out bare references, then the viewer begins to expect them.<br />
<br />
Given this predicament, how exactly does Pop Team Epic seem to avoid this pitfall? The answer, I believe, is that Pop Team Epic is not truly random; it would be more accurate to say that the specific subject matter of any one of its mini-skits is seemingly random. By this, I mean that any given skit can have literally any topic of focus, regardless of what the previous one focused on, but on the other hand, most of the individual skits themselves do have their own sense of continuity and strange yet self-consistent logic. What this means is that so long as Pop Team Epic is able to set up and deliver actual punchlines through these self-consistent skits, it can function as an effective comedy despite its apparent randomness of subject matter and the prevalence of pop culture references. Does Pop Team Epic do any of this, with any degree of success?<br />
<br />
Yes, it definitely does!<br />
<br />
Starting with the basics, Pop Team Epic makes use of many commonly-cited forms of humour in amongst all its madness. These include, among many others, comedic shifts in tone (certain “Hoshiiro Girldrop” interjections), ironic character actions (the cigarette joke in an idol skit), situations being taken 4 steps further than expected to the point of absurdity (the same idol skit’s conclusion), escalatory repetition (episode 2’s manga speech bubble skit), some puns and wordplay I’m not qualified to evaluate, and, alas, a few instances of seemingly barebones references that don’t seem to have any strings attached. However, those latter types are thankfully a much smaller minority than one might expect. In most cases, there’s a concerted effort to at least add something of substance the the reference in question, even if it’s not always immediately apparent.<br />
<br />
Of course, simply having punchlines present isn’t enough on its own. The fact that most of these “traditional” styles of jokes are condensed into extremely short skits (setting aside some longer-form exceptions with multiple punchlines like the aforementioned idol skit) does pose a challenge for the show in terms of having the time to instill expectations or ideas in a viewer, and then deliver a joke that isn’t completely obvious from the brief setup given. However, I personally found Pop Team Epic’s success rate to be higher than anticipated, perhaps because its variety of material and approaches gave it plenty of options for what direction to take any given skit in, while still maintaining that critical sense of flow to avoid a nosedive into true randomness. It’s a precarious approach - a constant balancing act which didn’t hold every single time - but as far as I’m concerned, it worked well enough.<br />
<br />
So yes, this show does make use of some tried and true approaches to telling jokes, and frequently succeeds at maintaining the elements of surprise, buildup and payoff. However, Pop Team Epic is no ordinary comedy, and in addition to these more conventional approaches, it also carries a number of less-common tricks in its grab bag.<br />
<br />
For instance, Pop Team Epic will often subvert the standard 4-panel format in order to further enhance its element of surprise, or add even more variety to how its jokes are delivered. 4-panel comedy strips will often spend three panels setting the stage, and then deliver their punchline on the fourth panel. This, of course, also applies to their adaptations, whether or not the boundaries between skits, sections or scenarios remain clear after the transition. In the case of Pop Team Epic, this transition is marked clear as polished glass by voiced-over title cards.<br />
<br />
Pop Team Epic, however, often defies this conventional setup by placing an unexpected punchline near the beginning of the skit - what would be equivalent to the first or second panel in its original form - with the remaining panels adding onto it in some way, such as by taking the joke to further extremes or making humorous comments. This further adds to the element of surprise by varying the timing at which a punchline can hit.<br />
<br />
In other cases, Pop Team Epic will flip the idea of the non sequitur card on its head, taking its normally-unrelated skits which the viewer expects to be unrelated in subject matter, and adds unexpected continuity between them to catch the viewer off guard. A good example of this (***brief spoiler for episode 3) is in a skit about Pipimi trying out a car, another person making disclaimers about its red colour and quietness, and Pipimi being satisfied, commenting that they can “kill in silence” and hide the blood on the car’s crimson hue. The skit ends, and the viewer expects the joke to end with it. Then the next skit is about Popuko looking for a job, and Pipimi handing her a suitcase full of cash, a gun, and a hitlist for assassination.<br />
<br />
(***end of spoiler)<br />
<br />
At another point, a skit makes reference to a certain piece of media, and then the next skit starts exactly the same way as the first, because the circumstances the first skit ended on would trigger a time reset in the universe being referenced. As a brief aside, this displays what I look for in referential humour. There should be some kind of punchline to go with the reference, and if the reference is necessary to understand the joke, its source should be something fairly recognizable to whatever audience is viewing it. In this instance, these conditions were met, showing that, at least some of the time, Pop Team Epic seems to understand that its frequent references cannot carry the comedy on its own.<br />
<br />
On a more straightforward level, Pop Team Epic will change up the styles and even mediums in which it presents a given skit. Later episodes in particular got especially creative with exploring new formats, including alternate animation styles, various live-action/animation mixtures, and an enthralling segment involving two live-action performers manipulating pages of a sketchbook. This variety alone added a certain degree of entertainment value simply in seeing what the show would come up with next, even setting aside some of the jokes that were told by leveraging these new formats.<br />
<br />
But that’s enough about formatting. It’s time to graduate to talking about the show’s attempts at full-on meta-humour that I’ve been building up.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I’m usually not the biggest fan of meta-humour, but this has less to do with the concept than it does with the execution. As I mentioned before, I very often see attempts at meta-humour amount to little more than breaking the fourth wall, or a show plainly pointing out what tvtropes.org entry it’s using at that particular moment. My gripes with this type of humour are similar to those of the non sequitur and referencial varieties: in isolation, as a one-off joke or small aside, it can work. However, doing it repeatedly ceases to surprise and can become increasingly annoying when overused. Furthermore, it simply lacks creativity; it takes next to no effort to do it and is far too common an approach. In short: it’s a lazy, done-to-death gimmick.<br />
<br />
But once again, Pop Team Epic steps beyond these trappings! It doesn’t stop at trivial self-awareness or fourth wall breaks. Instead, the fourth wall ceases to exist here, and the show makes use of the viewer&#039;s acceptance of its self-aware nature to tell jokes that simply wouldn’t have been the same otherwise.<br />
<br />
A character proclaims an action they&#039;ll perform in 30 minutes; the show shows them standing there waiting in real time as the ending sequence plays in the background. Viewer comments complaining about an animation quirk in certain segments are read; the show fixes this quirk and lets you witness the humorous results for yourself. Later episodes make sudden, unexpected yet seemingly obvious additions to the opening theme to comedic effect. Even the necessary censorship of copyrighted words leads to a pun that translated shockingly well into English, with the incredibly stupid yet earnest results leaving me rolling! These are just a few of many examples of Pop Team Epic reaching beyond usual approaches to meta-humour. These gags are novel, creative, and often surprisingly witty, leading to arguably some of the show’s best and most unique material.<br />
<br />
What I’m saying, in essence, is that for all this show&#039;s madness, I do see a method behind it. It has far more tricks to offer than simply throwing snot, superglue, tree sap, maple syrup, sticky notes and other trinkets at the viewer in hopes that something will stick. Furthermore, these tricks are often interesting and creative in their own right, and the show displays a clear ability to make use of them for uniquely comedic effect. Well, most of the time, anyway.<br />
<br />
And on that note, here is where I must address my main gripe with the series: its inconsistency.<br />
<br />
While I found many of Pop Team Epic’s skits to be a hit, and for others could at the very least see what the joke was, there were also quite a few segments which I simply didn’t understand. Whether it was because I didn’t know a reference, the joke was poorly presented, or because there simply wasn’t a joke at all, I can’t say for sure. Regardless, many of them just seemed to truly be random, have no point, or in rarer cases, simply exist as a reference with no apparent joke attached. Of course, some such segments turned out to simply be setting up for punchlines in later skits (“Are you upset?”, though this one arguably had a punchline to begin with), while others could be seen as planting expectations for a later variation with something in common (the first knitted musical number), continuing the trend of playing with the 4-panel format. Others, however, seemed to lack even this purpose.<br />
<br />
For some of these segments, one could make a case for anti-humour - intentionally skipping the expectation of a punchline as a punchline in and of itself, or perhaps having the punchline be that what’s happening should, in fact, be taken at face value. However, I found that these segments seemingly devoid of a punchline happened a bit too frequently for this to work. As such, they had little impact and forced me to simply give up on trying to figure them out. Congratulations, Pop Team Epic, you&#039;ve stumped me!<br />
<br />
I’ll say this, though: I’d much rather a joke fly over my head completely than have it bashed into my head and get brain damage. But a quick smack to the face is perfectly okay!<br />
<br />
In other words, I’m fine with blunt and over-the-top presentation (which can be found aplenty here), but I tend to dislike it when such presentation is combined with repeating or over-explaining trivial and obvious punchlines in a way that feels unnatural or forced. It comes across as the show being afraid the viewer might be too stupid to get it otherwise, or as some desperate attempt to draw additional laughs from something that’s clearly run dry of them. Thankfully, Pop Team Epic definitively avoids this particular pet peeve of mine. I can think of very few instances of a joke lingering beyond its allotted laugh-span - maybe some of the “Hoshiiro Girldrop” material overstayed its welcome. But even in those cases, it didn’t feel like it was forcibly dragged out, but rather, it simply went on as long as one might expect - which happened to be a bit longer than I found it funny - so this generally didn’t bother me much.<br />
<br />
In all other cases, Pop Team Epic, leveraging its 4-panel format, moves at a quick pace, with quick setup, quick delivery of its jokes, and quickly moving on from it, whether you “got it” or not. This sense of pacing also means that even though many jokes or skits may fail to hit their target, their rate of fire is high enough to minimize long stretches of barren content. There are still some weaker episodes, mainly early on, but I found the series as a whole to fare quite well in holding my interest and keeping me amused.<br />
<br />
And with that, I’ve just about covered my reasons for enjoying this show for what it is. For those brave or curious enough to give it a shot, a few things are worth noting in deciding how to watch it. First, if using official subtitles, I recommend going for Hidive’s over Crunchyroll’s. Many of the jokes contain nuances present in the former but lost in the latter. Funimation&#039;s English dub may also be a worthy alternative, but I can&#039;t speak on this personally. Secondly, Pop Team Epic has an unusual albeit suitable quirk in which every 12-minute episode is broadcast twice in a row, with the second adding extra context or substance to many of the jokes while giving Popuko and Pipimi different voice actors (usually a gruff male set for the second, adding to the surrealism). I myself usually preferred to skip to the 11:50 mark of each episode and just watch the more detailed second version, but how one chooses to respond to this quirk is up to them.<br />
<br />
Of course, most of us watch comedies primarily for laughter, and no matter how many types or theories of humour we may discuss to explain our enjoyment or lack thereof, in the end, laughter is personal, which all but guarantees that titles with wildly diverging opinions like this one will show up from time to time. So for those who enjoy the show as a collection of memes for forum boards, or simply as “Shitpost: The Anime”, that’s fine; keep doing so. Likewise, if you find the show insufferable to watch, there’s no need to force yourself into thinking otherwise. But by the same token, whether watching it casually or going for further analysis, love or hate it, appreciate or despise it, let&#039;s not sit here and pretend that our own viewpoint or experience is the only legitimate one, that everyone in the circle who disagrees must be idiots, or that the work sitting in the middle is somehow beneath us.<br />
<br />
As for my opinion, I enjoyed Pop Team Epic, both as a novelty act and as its own standalone product. Despite being more than a bit inconsistent, it still has its share of funny and memorable moments thanks to its straight-to-the-point attitude, creative use of meta-humour and blunt delivery of surreal gags, while mostly avoiding potential pitfalls of abusing non sequitur and referential humour. While it certainly won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, the show is also wholly committed to its unusual vision and shows a degree of skill in using its varied material, structuring and formatting to sell its unique brand of absurdity, For that, I respect it.

    Before anyone can answer the question: &quot;What is Pop Team Epic?&quot; I believe a more pressing question is more like &quot;Why in hell am I writing a serious review of this shit post?&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually, I have an answer to that question, unlike the first one. First of all, I love my absurd and nonsensical Chinese cartoons; I have a special place in my heart (and in some case my Top 10) for shows like Nichijou, Daily Lives of HS Boys, and of course, Gintama. That said, I don&#039;t really think Pop Team Epic can really stand up to those shows when we are talking about how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269817">
        entertaining they are, disregarding how much meaning or (non)sense they have integrated into their identity. <br />
<br />
I understand these are all big words, so I&#039;ll simplify it for those who only care for this anime because it&#039;s a shitpost:<br />
<br />
Pop Team Epic is a funny shitpost... but it gets old pretty quick. <br />
<br />
Although I have to say, this show almost convinced me that I should think otherwise, as this show isn&#039;t really trying to be anything grander than a shitpost.<br />
<br />
The problem is- while I can get lost watching vines, cracks and just plain memes on YouTube all day, I really can&#039;t say the same for Pop Team Epic. <br />
<br />
I understand I am only on the fourth episode of the anime as I am making this review, however, I am already bored of it. <br />
<br />
The problem with the anime is that random bullshit doesn&#039;t always equal entertainment for the audience. Bullshit needs consistency in its logic (unfortunately), or else it just becomes aimless, incoherent and pointless. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not like the anime is trying to parody one thing either. If it dedicated it&#039;s entire runtime to parodying JRPG anime like SAO (for example), then at least there would be something there for people to refer to for humor. It&#039;s a simple case of knowing what they are referencing, and the joke accurately making fun of the concept in a refreshing way. <br />
<br />
Parody anime like Gintama have mastered this effectively- I&#039;m not going to give spoilers, but a recent example of how Gintama plays with concepts found in its genre (shounen) and then shits on it while making it genuinely entertaining, is a scene from one of the latest episodes. <br />
<br />
The scene was of negotiations. On &quot;our&quot; side, we had the Shogun, whom now has bowel problems (it makes sense why he has bowel problems in context) and of one of the enemy leaders who was requested to negotiate with. The bowel problems in a normal shounen would be similar to that of &quot;butterflies in the stomach&quot;, however, the joke doesn&#039;t stop there as it builds on itself. The shogun tries to subtly hint at his need to go to the bathroom without being direct about it, the enemy takes his references out of context and interprets them as threats. Without ruining the joke by saying what happens next, essentially the enemy leader understands by the end that the Shogun needed to shit, and &quot;negotiations&quot; end there. Both are embarrassed, to say the least, and all misconceptions between the two sides are adjourned. That is literally how you shit on negotiations.<br />
<br />
Now after reading that somewhat competent explanation of a joke you probably didn&#039;t understand, tell me, when does Pop Team Epic do something like that?<br />
<br />
Initially, I thought Pop Team Epic was a parody of the slice of life genre, much like Nichijou, by taking scenarios you would see in real life and pushing the joke to 11. I haven&#039;t read the 4-Koma manga, but I remember a few strips that would support that claim- as I saw that Popuko was giving the middle finger in a scenario you really wouldn&#039;t because of social norms. I thought when I saw this &quot;This would really be funny because that&#039;s what we all want to do&quot;, so where is all of this in the anime?<br />
<br />
I suppose it can be later down the road, but why do we also have to do a parody of video games (that really doesn&#039;t make sense), horror movies, anime, manga, Hollywood blockbuster films intermixed with random nonsense that both looks ugly and makes no sense, AND THEN having the entire episode repeat itself before having time to comprehend it?<br />
<br />
There&#039;s such a thing as overload, and Pop Team Epic doesn&#039;t seem to understand that you can&#039;t be funny without something like a breather. <br />
<br />
Not to mention the lack of consistency in both the animation and stories themselves damages all suspension of disbelief. That said, I never had any, nor did it need suspension of disbelief, because the purpose of this anime is to shit on other media. <br />
<br />
All Pop Team Epic needed to do was shit on others right. <br />
<br />
And it didn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Now I&#039;m sure that something will change in the span of the next 9 episodes, actually, I am practically guaranteeing that they&#039;ll do something crazy for their finale. But right now I am just bored of this anime. <br />
<br />
What is Pop Team Epic? I suppose Pop Team Epic is just... too much of everything.

    Overview:<br />
<br />
This is is what it would look like if you took all the cutaway gags from Family Guy and just stitched them together. That&#039;s the whole show. I at least chuckled a couple times, so I&#039;ve seen worse comedy anime. This is still pretty damn bad!<br />
<br />
Plot?<br />
<br />
The plot is that random pop culture references happen. Oh look they referenced Skyrim! Oh look they referenced Dark Souls...and that&#039;s the joke. They referenced something. At least in Kobayashi&#039;s Dragon Maid when they parody Dark Souls, the joke is that a 5,000 year old, all powerful dragon is becoming addicted to a video game and acting like an otaku.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274718">
        The joke isn&#039;t just that they alluded to the game in the first place.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Two girls who are drawn absurdly poorly make references and flip you the bird. This show is really making me miss Super Milk Chan. I NEVER thought I would have to say that.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Well...at least it isn&#039;t all CG. Also it looks slightly better than President Trap Kun.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
When I saw the first episode I had a feeling of sheer dread in my stomach. I felt certain that MAL was going to rate this show over 8.5 and make it the ironically overrated series of the year. We did it with Pingu in 2017. Haha the joke is that it isn&#039;t really an anime. Remember how funny it was when Papa Franku made this same joke about FOUR FUCKING YEARS AGO! We did it with Food Wars. I personally don&#039;t see what makes Nichijou and Gintama THAT much better than this shit, but I don&#039;t need to understand MAL&#039;s taste. I&#039;m just so proud of you guys right now. It&#039;s a shit series and it&#039;s rated like shit! Praise be to God!

      This anime is a complete piece of trash, in fact, I don&#039;t even know why TF am I writing a review for this piece of garbage. No matter how you try to look at at this anime, it&#039;s a trash. It is nothing more but a much of editing created by a bunch of idiots.<br />
  Just like the people who gave this a 1,  Kamikaze Douga never wanted to create a masterpiece, they wanted to create a piece of sh*t. And the anime tells us loud and clear:&quot;We poured our heart in to make a piece of trash.&quot; <br />
  Thus,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272250">
        20 minutes of completely random, pointless and bad jokes were created. What? You didn&#039;t have any pleasure while watching it? Perfect! Because that&#039;s exactly what the creators whats, to completely sh*t on your face. To play you around their weird and old references like a toy. <br />
  And for those who saw the first episode, went on this site filled with rage, gave this anime a 1, and never touched it again, then congratulation, you at least are serious when it comes to watching anime. <br />
<br />
&quot;You mad?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#039;m not mad.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mad?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#039;m not mad.&quot;<br />
Perfect, let me beat you up, deep fried you and then cookies out of you.<br />
&quot;You mad?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#039;m not mad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lastly, for those who analyze this anime frame by frame, joke by joke. Can you tell me, what does this piece of sh*t taste like to you?

    Pop Team Epic is the name. Offering jokes that make no sense its game. Like it or not, it&#039;s all the same. Your sense of humor is to blame. <br />
<br />
Philosophers, fools and shitposters all around the globe have been asking this question recently, but also since the dawn of tragicomedy: What makes a joke funny? Is there a single factor that answers to this question? Everything can be funny as long as it is presented in the preferred way. Much like with anime series, it is all about the execution. But this is still all about personal preferences, perspective and knowledge. How can a popculture

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277956">
        reference deliver if one does not know what is is referring to? The original question has been answered already hundreds of times: The funny was inside you all along. #deep  #derp<br />
<br />
Pop Team Epic is a series thats target audience is the whole internet culture. Its jokes varie greatly from parodies to live action interviews. From original content to ridiculously bad coaxed into a snafu-tier memes. It&#039;s even familiar with taiwanese puppet shows, obscurities of all sort, and awkward elevator music. The series has a bit of everything, and for this reason its writing is full of quality differences. It&#039;s nearly impossible for every joke appeal to all viewers. Almost every joke in it can be understood in different ways and found to be funny/not funny for different reasons. This is quite original for comedy series and part of the reason why I found the series to be worth of my time so much that I watched it twice. There has been quite a few obscure comedies in the past, such as Masuda Kousuke Gekijou, Gag Manga Biyori and Tensai Senshi, but none of them successful. <br />
<br />
The actual idea behind the series production is fairly interesting. It shows us how much voice actors can change the tone of the series and the aspects of jokes. Every episode is approximately 24 minutes long, but in practice it is just 12 minutes of either identical or highly similar content. The main difference are the voice actors. Other half is presented with male seiyuus and the another with female seiyuus. The male version typically also comes with extras such as quest analysis, voice-over live action reaction to the joke, and whatever else. <br />
<br />
I enjoyed this series for its uniqueness, different approach, and scenes such as flip-cover live action music show presented by 2 members of the production team. There is simply no other anime in existence that would even try to do content like this. It alone is worth of something: worth of giving Pop Team Epic a go.

    ポプテピピック (Pop Team Epic) is far more phenomenal than most anime ever produced and released would ever be. It is a cultural celebration of anime as a whole from the adapted works of Bkub Okawa into many reaches of genre, style and presentation, and it&#039;s pretty shitty!<br />
<br />
There&#039;s absolutely no need to dawn any thinking caps, judgemental barometers or even acquired tastes to appreciate everything Pop Team Epic has to offer, from the prospective yet tastefully dated memes and references, to the plethora of genres it covers from comedy to action, horror to romance, sci-fi to thriller etc., to the gunbelt array of studios and producers

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275858">
        of each segment all representative of the vast styles of anime such as olden, CGI, modern, experimental, and everything in between, leads like Kamikaze Douga (haha snuck in some JoJo), Space Cat Company, Thibault Tresca, the immensely talented Makoto Yamashita and of course, the awe inspiring AC Department, all who&#039;ve each handed well respected and unforgettable adaptations and original content.<br />
Following suite to the meat of this review, Pop Team Epic is graded under the usual criteria but under the circumstances of its genre and meaning:<br />
<br />
Story -/10<br />
Each encounter is completely unaffected by the last and helps portray the randomness and non-linear coherse plot that this anime obviously does not have. A simple story regarding the ominous shadow lords does encapsulate itself in the beginning, but you have to watch the show to find out what happens afterwards though~ ♥<br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
Whether spot on manga recreations, free liberty of Bob Epic Team, or the wonderful CGI portrayal, each representation is beautifully done to their own accord and some background art even having more right than needed be to look as good as they do for a show such as this. Only the best here.<br />
<br />
Sound and Music 10/10<br />
All effects are mastered well, both sides of repeating episodes featuring male and female voice overs were spectacular, (another bonus point, what show can you name off the top of your head that does this revolutionary thing) nobody is inaudible unless needed to be and the music is absolutely glorious, from OP to ED, in different styles and singers, and especially the OST capturing moods perfectly. Eisaaai! Haramasukoi!<br />
<br />
Characters 10/10<br />
Everyone and thing is just so cute ohmigoooooooo-<br />
No doubts here, all main and supporting cast are destinctive, expressive, and most importantly, memorable.<br />
<br />
Overall, Pop Team Epic is fantastically enjoyable to nearly everyone who&#039;s finna woke at any time or situation, barring short term dated memes. Make no mistake, it is a shitty anime, everyone thinks so too, but it&#039;s undeniably a show that will withstand time and harbour memories of reliving the golden ages of anime as a whole, while bringing whole communities together, old and new. 10/10.<br />
Thank you very much for reading!

    Pop Team Epic is not art. It may be anime, if only in the most literal of definitions, but it is not art. It cannot be art. Art is a creative process, and there is nothing creative about Pop Team Epic. It is an amalgam of references strewn about in the most banal of ways. Skyrim exists. Totoro exists. Pokémon exists. That is all Pop Team Epic has to say. It just reminds you that better media exists, but in ways that are disrespectful and offensive to the time of the unfortunate viewer.<br />
<br />
Pop Team Epic is a dreadful product. It is anti-art. It is anti-comedy.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275830">
        It is a middle finger to those who produce art because Pop Team Epic is devoid of creativity, vision, and passion; or to put it simply, something that is not art but wishes it was, and so instead it has to violently lash out towards.<br />
<br />
The artwork and animation quality is awful. It is a poor adaptation of the source material, as the production staff was so obviously unaware of the differences between print and animated mediums. The sound is exceptionally poor. Normally a production like this would not be given the OK, but in the case of Pop Team Epic, it was allowed to pass because it was not a serious artistic product, but a way to sell merchandise to easily manipulated consumers through viral 24 minute commercials under the guise of of art.

    Sometimes you come across a show that&#039;s so bad it&#039;s funny. A great example would be the dub of Ghost Stories, which has become (in)famous for its ridiculous voice acting antics. Or you could point to something like Garzey&#039;s Wing, which accidentally became a cult classic thanks to its nonsensical story and people that never know how to use their inside voices.<br />
<br />
Pop Team Epic is in neither of these categories. Pop Team purposefully tries to be funny by being bad, and fails miserably at it. It throws out random jokes and overdone faces and scribbled animation that I would have found funny about 10 years

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313801">
        ago, and find downright painful to watch now. I can&#039;t blame anyone for their own sense of humor, but for me the &quot;lolrandom&quot; humor of the internet stopped being funny when I was about 13. This show actually had me with my head in my hands several times because I wanted to just shut it off. I forced myself through it because I hate leaving things unfinished, but it was like Chinese water torture, like the Iron Maiden, like the Skyrim intro over and over and over again.<br />
<br />
This show wanted to be so-bad-it&#039;s-good, but almost every joke, every reference, every visual had me cringing as if it was written by a board of directors somewhere that were browsing through the internet and said: &quot;Hey, people like this random shit don&#039;t they? People will laugh at this right?&quot; To be fair I laughed 3, maybe 4 times throughout (you got boost power!), but a total of 20 seconds enjoyment does nothing to make me hate this show less when I suffered through 98% of it.<br />
<br />
An unironically unfunny dumpster fire. Bury it and never dig it out again.

    Not every manga or a novel can be turned into an anime and Poputepipikku is one of those anime that shouldn&#039;t have been adapted.<br />
<br />
Most of the people who watched Poputepipikku did that because it was very popular as a shitposting manga rather than a normal one, it never had a story and was always random with stuff sometimes being funny, wholesome or annoying depending on how you personally feel, it was like a meme machine and it should have stayed like that, the anime was disappointing because of a lot of reasons. The random jokes which could be a hit or miss, the references but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274842">
        the people making the anime never realized that making a reference wasn&#039;t the funny part, it was how it was presented and used which makes it funny, take Gintama for example, that anime has a lots of references but that wasn&#039;t why it is funny, it&#039;s funny because of how it used those reference in the episodic or even arc episodes after the reference, I was watching the episodes and starting to hope for the IDOL love stuff at the preview to become the actual anime rather than this one specially at the start, the anime.<br />
Also bob epic team was garbage. <br />
<br />
The worst thing is probably the cringy stuff that was made during the last 12 weeks that the producers/publishers were doing, for example making the same episode twice because it&#039;s a troll XD, broadcasting the same episode 8 times in a row just to make a reference and other cringy stuff that made feel sorry for them for wasting all that money unnecessary.<br />
<br />
The best thing about the anime is the Opening, it&#039;s so good from the song to the animation, well the animation in the whole anime was amazing tbh.<br />
There were some jokes that made me laugh and references that were used fittingly but they were rare which is why the anime wasn&#039;t enjoyable for me.<br />
<br />
Overall I would give it a generous 4/10.<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t recommend it tbh reading it would be better.

    Poputepipikku is just shitposting . Nothing more than that . Do you believe that some shitposting will going to save the whole anime endustry ? I think the answer must be no but Poputepipikku showed out of nowhere and everyone liked it . Do I think liking somehing is wrong? Of course I don&#039;t everyone has his own personal taste . I just don&#039;t like Poputepipikku . The reson is the jokes are occasionaly hard to understand . Everything feels like it&#039;s repetitive and after a whole lot of shitposting (That&#039;s what i do at every social network) it gets boring . It doesn&#039;t ruin

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284936">
        it&#039;s potential I mean a lot of shitpost lovers will going to like this because they have no life and all they do is shitposting everyday (that&#039;s sad) . Poputepipikku&#039;s main problem is after a while weirdness starts to be boring . Every episode is just only weird nothing more than that . Memes , references and jokes are not good because you can&#039;t understand any of them (maybe a lot of Japanese culture will help) . Poputepipikku gets boring after a while and their whole thing becomes pathetic . Basically if you watch 1 episode of Poputepipikku you could count yourself that you watch the whole series . Because that is the only thing there , nothing more . That&#039;s why I don&#039;t like it . Overall 1/10

    Hoshiiro Girldrop came as a surprise this year. What appeared to be nothing more than a generic slice of life series actually ended up being a rather heartwarming experience.<br />
This review may contain mild spoilers, but I won&#039;t go into detail about anything specific past the first episode.<br />
<br />
Hoshiiro Girldrop follows the antics of our two main characters, Daichi and Sosogu. These childhood friends are reunited in a peculiar way: Sosogu just kinda moved in with Daichi.<br />
Apparently Daichi made a promise to her long ago, but he has no recollection of this at all. <br />
<br />
Now if I&#039;m being honest, Daichi isn&#039;t one of the best protagonists. His

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272893">
        character can come across as bland. His chemistry with Sosogu on the other hand makes the show, mostly because<br />
they&#039;re the most mismatched couple possible. An old standard for romcoms, sure, but why fix what ain&#039;t broke.<br />
<br />
All in all, if you&#039;re looking for a fun romcom/slice of life to pass the time, Hoshiiro Girldrop is definitely a show for you, but so far the show hasn&#039;t presented anything to make this a must watch.<br />
<br />
I rate Hoshiiro Girl--- NOT!<br />
<br />
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Pop Team Epic. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of intensive psychology most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Pipimi’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterisation- her personal philosophy draws heavily from shitpost literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Pop Team Epic truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Popuko’s existential catchphrase “A H ? Y O U  A R E  M O T H E R F * C K E R ?,” which itself is a cryptic reference to bkub’s Japanese epic Hoshiiro Girldrop. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Okawa’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂<br />
<br />
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Pop Team Epic tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎<br />

    Ok let&#039;s first get the shitposting out of the way &lt;LA clicks LA&#039;s finger joints&gt;<br />
<br />
Pop Team Epic is a better Yuri Genre story than Citrus, Are you mad?, Shut the fuck up and die, Your motherfucking life ends 30 minutes from now!, Seen it, Watch Pop Team Epic Thanks!, Eisai haramasukoi! AND Pop Team Epic is best anime of 2018.......<br />
<br />
Sorry was thinking about Hellshake Yano...<br />
<br />
Pop Team Epic is one of those animes that doesn&#039;t give a shit, this essentially being an anime short where it takes the piss out of pop culture from both Western and Japanese media, subcultures and hipsters alike with Popuko and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274864">
        Pipimi all voiced by countless voice actors from Mamiko Noto to Mikako Komatsu to Tomokazu Sugita to Hiro Shimono many of the pairings on both the male and female versions having anime references (and reunions) to them as well, another words, the voice cast is bloody AMAZING. So for an anime short that doesn&#039;t give a shit, well for LA, LA might as well go with the crowd with it and LA enjoyed immensely or sometimes just utterly baffled in some skits with how this anime short just didn&#039;t give a shit with almost no sign of low quality baiting (Bob Team Epic is bloody taking the piss out of it you realize?) thus doing it well for the most part from the aforementioned pop culture references to the out of animation skits...though there are some flaws with that mainly the weirdness of Bob Team Epic series and those French segments which is...just WTF for LA but still it&#039;s Pop Team Epic.<br />
<br />
Ok ok so the obvious is that if you don&#039;t like dank memes like these then you can unsubscribe to this anime short because that&#039;s really is what Pop Team Epic is, you wanna change whatever Pop Team Epic is from a trolling anime short into....into what?...then it&#039;s no Pop Team Epic either way. It&#039;s shitposting in the form of anime at it&#039;s finest. WHY do you think Pop Team Epic had a 22 minute run time but had only the first 10 minutes REPEATED TWICE just with different voice actors and some small changes here and there?, because Pop Team Epic being a full fledged anime series was a jab at those people who didn&#039;t think it would be possible and Pop Team Epic banked on it and WORKED.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation, well the &quot;animation&quot; is the say the least as even though the animation done by Kamikaze Douga is there in it&#039;s varieties of 2D to 3D animation, from the intentionally poor quality work of Bob Team Epic series to the live action French segments and Hellshake Yano and the Live Voice acting skit, HELL Pop Team Epic by definition blends both 2D and LIVE ACTION together at times and showing the diverse range of &quot;animation&quot; used for an anime short such as this but nonetheless Pop Team Epic&#039;s skit based formula was used especially in the animation department is by overall.....diverse and rather great at that, even the OP is amazing!.<br />
<br />
Hoshiiro Girl Drops needs an fully fleshed out anime!!! wait it&#039;s getting a second season REJOICE MOTHERFUCKERS!!...yes the anime short short that had little coverage only at the end of the credits halfway the anime short...Hi Yui Ogura!!!<br />
<br />
Pop Team Epic is shitposting at it&#039;s finest, surreal and WTFery is it&#039;s bread and butter with diverse and by the looks of it, high budget for such an anime short ABOUT dank memes it&#039;s amazing Pop Team Epic even GOT an anime to begin with, so don&#039;t be cynical and watch what is by a definition of the finest quality shitposting in anime form you&#039;ve seen...that will be dated in no time, thanks Internet!.

    I’ll preface this by saying comedy is subjective and you can like whatever you like. Maybe I’m just a low iq idiot who can’t understand the deep themes in pop team epic. Who knows?<br />
<br />
This show was fun for about 1 episode, 2 at max. In the beggining it was kind of like ”haha this is funny because it’s shitposting and that’s not common for anime. Anime of the year amirite LUL.” But then you realize you’re a fucking retard.<br />
In my mind, this show is built upon three things. Cool gamer references, random=funny humour and 4th wall breaking.  The easiest thing to throw shit at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275056">
        is the random=funny aspect so I’ll start with that. Unless you’re still in the 4th grade you won’t find this funny. That’s just how it is. After you’ve experienced it one time it’s purely annoying.<br />
And the cool gamer references are just that. Gamer references. They don’t do anything with it they just put popuko and pipimi in a videogame. Ansolutely hysterical. <br />
I’ll admit though, I did enjoy some of the references but that’s mostly because they were unexpected. And in general, I really like references to other things in media. Just not when it is used in the same way over and over again while also not doing much with it.<br />
And the fourth wall breaking (apart from hellshake yano) wasn’t good at all either. It was pretty much also just ”random=funny”. I found the reoccuring french thing especially annoying as every single one of those segments were deadass boring.<br />
Art for the show was alright and I did like the bob epic team segments quite a bit cause I’m a fan of wonky artstyles.<br />
Sound was also pretty alright I guess. There are 2 different dubs which give of different vibes so maybe some people will like that. And if you don’t like it you can just skip one.<br />
And I would be negative towards how the episodes are so short or whatever but it is a 4 panel manga and it really doesn’t need to be longer.<br />
<br />
Overall, this show sucks, don’t watch it unless you’re, as I said, in the 4th grade or lower. Or if you want to hurt yourself idk.

    Okay everyone knows it&#039;s shit posting. Either you like it or you don&#039;t. Comedy of course. If you&#039;re looking for an anime with a coherent story, get out now. If you like memes, retarded jokes, you&#039;ll probably love it.<br />
<br />
There ain&#039;t a narrative, no story no nothing. Nothing like Nichijou or Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou. So don&#039;t expect much running gags or the gags forming a satisfying story line like Nichijou.<br />
<br />
Art style seems pretty okay with it changing quite dynamically. Not your standard style of cutsie anime characters, they aren&#039;t meant to look that way. Might seem crude to some.<br />
<br />
Sound effects are pretty good, opening song

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269880">
        is pretty damn catchy. I gotta rewatch to remember how the bgm sounds to say anything more in depth about it lol.<br />
<br />
This anime has nothing to do at all with what makes a standard anime great. There&#039;s no character development, there&#039;s no deep layering of plot(or plot to begin with), there&#039;s no proper pacing, no, none of that from this anime.<br />
<br />
Unless you are an edgy meme lord that already knows about this anime, chances you&#039;ll like it is slim. Though it&#039;s nothing like what someone criticized it for &quot;being random&quot;. This anime HAS NO PLOT.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t need to follow a rule to comedy. I must admit it&#039;s quite &quot;random&quot; in it&#039;s different jokes in the sense that you&#039;ll not expect what gags they put out next. <br />
<br />
Some are straight up not funny, some are just straight up retarded autism. But it&#039;s the fact that I can&#039;t guess what&#039;s coming up next that keeps me entertained. I don&#039;t even get more than half the references they put out. Maybe that&#039;s what pushes people away from this anime but if you don&#039;t mind and can appreciate poking fun at anything at all, you might like this.<br />
<br />
I must say though, those references/what they poke fun at I don&#039;t get at all can be really excruciating to sit through. Especially when the skit is like 5 minutes long and you&#039;re like wtf throughout it, then have to watch it again(with different voice acting). The anime is basically half as long with the other half being different voice acting, and a subtle change in dialog sometimes if you&#039;re attentive enough.<br />
<br />
All in all it&#039;s just a shitpost. If you hate if you hate it. If you love shitpost you&#039;ll love it. Of course I&#039;m one of them. I ain&#039;t professional so screw my review if you think I make shit sense but yeah just a slice of an apple<br />

    (This review was written in 2018. I found it hidden away in my folders, and just now decided to post it. As such, it is a product of its time.) <br />

Yes, this will be an actual review, but I need to make something clear about this show. Please stay until the end. <br />
<br />
There’s an interesting trend going on with this anime I’ve seen before elsewhere, and that is the “easy target” syndrome. Despite a show having actual issues or not, something that had a devoted fanbase and little criticism will get some flack once it enters a certain zone of popularity. Take, for example… basically

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389404">
        every anime that gains widespread attention. The “seasonal hits,” per se. Sword Art Online. Attack on Titan. Kill la Kill. One Punch Man… there’s one every year. Once something reaches the public eye, people are going to want to be contrarian about it. (I’m not saying this is always unwarranted, nor am I saying that I think shows actually have an objective level of quality—I happen to think that idea is preposterous. I elaborate more on this notion in my One Punch Man review) <br />
<br />
This season, the anime Kotaku proclaims as a show that is “Burning Anime to the Ground,” is the adaption of a relatively niche four-panel comedy manga, Pop Team Epic. It’s not so complex—two chibi girls parody anime in short skits. The humor is wacky, intense, in your face, and quick. <br />
<br />
Now, Pop Team Epic has had a devoted but small online following for a while, made up mostly of many a-forum user, web artist, well-knowledged-weeb that would use panels as reaction pictures and share the newest strip amongst their friends. And as in every super niche community, Pop Team Epic has had very little criticism, if any. The people that knew what it was just loved it. <br />
<br />
Now, that’s not the case. Here comes the “easy target” syndrome. This quote is not my own writing—it comes from the “Your Mileage May Very” Pop Team Epic TV Tropes page, and it beautifully sums up the problem here when people see this show as a mess. <br />
<br />
“It’s Popular, Now it Sucks: A rather odd variation of this trope has come into effect as of the anime&#039;s premiere. While Pop Team Epic has maintained a rather noticeable cult following throughout its run as a manga, public opinion did a massive 180 upon the airing of the first episode. The biggest reason for this seems to be that the anime ended up exposing Pop Team Epic&#039;s unusual style of humor to audiences outside of the admittedly claustrophobic niche that the original manga appealed to (note that anime is far more popular than manga in the west, to the point where a manga is more than likely to fall into obscurity if it doesn&#039;t get an anime adaptation). As a result, the premiere of Pop Team Epic caused the series to wind up in the hands of the much larger crowd of people who didn&#039;t see any real appeal in it. Putting aside the fans who jokingly disparage the anime in reference to the manga&#039;s own Self-Deprecation, most opinions online regarding the anime tend to negatively compare it to a Vine compilation. Not helping is how any attempts by fans to explain why the series appeals to them or what makes its comedy style so unique tends to get brushed off with the infamous &quot;to be fair you have to have a high IQ to understand&quot; copypasta.”<br />
<br />
Humor is a pretty subjective idea. Like horror, it takes a lot of different things to make someone laugh, as it takes a lot of different things to make someone scared. Some people appreciate complex, intelligent humor. Others like nonsensical, abrupt humor. Some people like awful normie sitcoms. Yes, I think taste in any type of show is pretty subjective already, but while laughter is universal, what causes it is not. <br />
<br />
I’m a little infamous in this community for having a not-so-favorable review of One Punch Man, deeming that it has only one joke, and that the joke gets old quick—and I can see the same argument made for PTE, but it just isn’t the same type of repetition. Yes, Pop Team Epic is basically just an elaborate shitpost, but it manages to be a shitpost in more than one way. Instead of ragging on shonen and superheroes the exact same way twelve times in a row, it delivers a platter of everything from witty reference and criticism, to 2010’s retarded rage-face humor, to inside jokes I doubt anyone even understands. Within this context, I can gladly tell you that the volume of variety at least makes it worthwhile. For example of its relatable side; the cuckoo clock skit literally had me on the floor. Who doesn&#039;t hate those things? For example of its ridiculous side: anything regarding the Bob Team Epic skits. MS Paint humor is YouTubePoop humor, and it doesn’t have to make sense. It’s just dumb. <br />
<br />
I came here to defend Pop Team Epic because it’s not humor for everyone. It speaks to an age of the Internet and trends within the movement of anime that are already pretty divisive in and of themselves, and if that alienates some viewers, I would understand. But I think proclaiming it as being an awful show is a bit unfair. It pays to a mindset that younger critics like to have about “the critic being smarter than the show,” which I’ve seen in a lot of comment sections and conversations in and around the YouTube film community. It&#039;s like people just want to hate on something now because it’s popular, which I’ve been vocal about disapproving of many times in the past. People need to step back and look at what THEY happen to like or dislike, and not let the amount of people that happen to like it dictate their tastes. <br />
<br />
But if one takes a look at Pop Team Epic fairly and thinks the humor isn’t for them, I commend it. There’s bad in this show too. The creator has said many times that he uses inside jokes that only he would understand. Who would be able to appreciate that? This may be part of its charm, but no wonder some people have been alienated. <br />
<br />
Overall, what Pop Team Epic seems to present above all else is its direct idea—a charming, fast paced, pull no punches skit compilation that teeters on being basically just a shitpost. Maybe it truly is just a shitpost, in hindsight, but it has a lot of effort behind it just to be that and nothing else. And that’s what it’s meant to be. Take it or leave it, folks.  <br />
<br />
PROS:<br />
-	Wide variety of humor.<br />
-	Opening and ending themes are pretty good songs in their own right.<br />
-	Has a good grasp of new-age pop culture.<br />
MIXED: <br />
-	Humor demands a level of inside knowledge <br />
-	Skits may have charm in their short length, but that makes it difficult to grasp the joke the first time you watch it… if at all.<br />
-	The nature of the show basically just being a self-aware shitpost altogether.<br />
-	It’s also pretty fuckin’ obnoxious. Take that how you will.<br />
CONS:<br />
-	It has spawned some annoying internet culture.<br />
-	Overuse of nonsensical humor—to an extent. It’s not impossible to wear down charm.<br />
<br />
Overall, the show is a cult phenomenon. Nothing more, nothing less. I happen to have enjoyed it every week, and that comes down to my sense of humor, knowledge of anime, and presence on the Internet. <br />
<br />
Or maybe it’s because I have a very high IQ and watch Rick and Morty instead of going to school, who knows. <br />

    POOp<br />
there is no story, but that isn&#039;t the appeal to this masterpiece clearly.<br />
I guess the best way to sum up what goes on would be to say everything is very stupid<br />
every minute was so good, packed with references and shit posts <br />
I found myself laughing audibly quite often<br />
I think I enjoyed it because I found the things the characters to be very silly! Every second there is something dumb happening, if you think that would be funny, this may interest you<br />
It feels like something out of a 6 panel newspaper comic (which might be what this is)<br />
very cute anime &gt;_&lt; watch if you are
