    I don’t understand the hate, I really don’t…<br />
<br />
The all-knowing and savior of this world, Godsuya, is back after many long years with the usual cast and some blonde tsundere. While many people hate it from the overpowered Godsuya to the sister who loves him a little too much(don’t blame her, honestly) to what many perceive to be a flat plotline, I for one appreciate this season more than I did the last.<br />
<br />
As usual, the animation and quality of this anime are amazing. The animation really does make the art shine, from battle scenes to lovable sister moments; this anime continues to deliver from this standpoint.<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361265">
        story at this point is quite straightforward, don’t mess with Godsuya. I mean other than that, I guess there is a blonde trying to find the identity of a vampire. Well, as the story develops, the moments I want to include, Godsuya being Godsuya.<br />
<br />
Characters are single-handedly the greatest component of this anime. Tatsuya, Shiba(Godsuya), and his sister Miyuki, Shiba are the siblings we long for in an anime. Godsuya the legend among legends, the overpowered MC among overpowered MC, has time and time again that he should have his own religion. In this season, not only did he make an American blonde tsundere(Angelina, Kudou Shields) fall for him literally by looking at her, we see his sister even more attracted to Godsuya than the first season(again don’t blame her). One thing I’d like from this season is some character development especially towards Godsuya, so we can praise him more and establish a religion for him.<br />
<br />
The sound and music are quite nice; it approaches us with fluid sounds in a battle scene to alone time with the sister. The OP and ED are good and the soundtrack ties the anime together.<br />
<br />
If you want to continue your ride in the “All hail Godsuya” train this anime is right for you!<br />

    There is an uncanny misconception floating around in regards to &quot;overpowered characters&quot; and that according to such existence the whole show is deemed bad from the get-go. Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei also fell into this rabbit hole and apparently even our savior Tatsuya can&#039;t do much to stop all the lies from spreading. I didn&#039;t mean to, but you leave me no choice - I&#039;m putting an end to this pandemonium.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
After 5 years of agony waiting for a sequel with only a side-story movie put in between, the second season of Mahouka came in all of its glory featuring one of the fan-favorite protagonists in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369989">
        all of anime and a much-loved yet inexplicably controversial show in itself. Back in 2014 when it first aired, some people with dicks in their mouths raised their hand and asked one question only: Who in Alabama made this anime - to which everyone within a 5-mile radius simultaneously answered - it is much deeper than you think and they weren&#039;t wrong at all since to understand this anime and why it matters in their life, you need a 5-year degree of stay on Facebook and 2 in their most repugnant groups so that your IQ will increase and come into the realization this anime is not simply a self-insert shtick with incest added to flavor it up.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s about Tatsuya and his teachings that we must appreciate. The story of a simple fellow who never wanted and never thought of becoming who he is now but because of this great power he has no choice but to use it for the greater good even if it means the worst outcome for lot of. A not easy task to fulfill but one that must go until the very bottom. With him there&#039;s his sister, the core of the nonsense controversial people think it has. She&#039;s there to help her brother but whenever she&#039;s got the chance she tries to suck his dick but Tatsuya has better plans for her. He&#039;s playing the long game here and acting that he doesn&#039;t care about her in a romantic way and that he&#039;s just tempting her where in reality he&#039;s waiting for the moment Miyuki&#039;s defense is at a bare minimum so he can strike a big maneuver on her. With the advantage of 69 no imouto would be able to resist his true behavior and may God have mercy on Miyuki&#039;s pussy on that faithful night because he&#039;s gonna crush it.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
I saw Mahouka back in 2017 and liked it a lot, so much that it became a personal favorite of mine. At the time I had (still have) a certain love for the overpowered characters and the whole concept of Mahouka, as well as the characters and their quirky personalities, made my heart Doki-Doki (although it wasn&#039;t the first time). Tatsuya&#039;s interaction with her sister was indeed a blast - her blushing for every word her onii-sama said made me undertake a non-healthy path I never thought I&#039;d take - to self-insert to guys like him and be successful as I&#039;ve always wanted - surrounded by a bunch of girls, making them do naughty things to me or to each other, and much more I don&#039;t think you want to know. Unlike back then, I rarely do it anymore, but I still appreciate it enough to tell the tale and what a riveting tale it was. Despite my early years of watching anime and the fact at the time I could&#039;ve liked perhaps everything, Raihousha-hen it&#039;s almost as good as its predecessor. It would have been better if we had gotten a 2-cour season instead. Not only we would have fleshed out some prominent characters more but because the story itself needed more time to get it done in a more impactful way, albeit it was great anyway.<br />
<br />
Despite its predictable premise, Mahouka never goes downhill as each character is written in a nuance that enhances the story the right way but still makes the protagonist shine without making it seem forced. One of the ways they go about is the dialogue and is DONE RIGHT. Unlike LoGH who is there to pad for some time, here it has an identity within its story and not only serves as a tool to give the little exposition we need to understand the next puzzle pieces but also give some growth to them as well foreshadows what will happen to them later. While it&#039;s obvious Tatsuya has the most important role, others are no less either because without them even Tatsuya wouldn&#039;t have much against certain situations and it&#039;s a great way to show how much he growth but also that he&#039;s not simply an &quot;overpowered character&quot; with no purpose at all. He has his friends, his adorable sister and a bunch of other guys and honestly, that&#039;s just for the better.<br />
<br />
Mahouka is not a bad show AND I&#039;M ANGRY YOU DISLIKE SOMETHING I LIKE. GAH.

    Behold, the chosen one has returned after the prophesied 6 years to grace the anime medium with his presence. The one true prophet of Kirito has arrived to show off his epic protagonist powers. He has been called many scary names, such as &quot;Mahesvara, Demon of Okinawa, GOD of Destruction, and Onii-sama” Men fear him. Women, especially his sister mind you, want to bear his children. He hath no fear of silly trivialities such as character growth or conflict, for he is perfect in every aspect. Yes, the great Tatsuya is back, and he’s as bland as ever! Err, I mean badass! Yeah…*ahem* a-anyway, let’s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361314">
        get into it.<br />
<br />
The plot consists of an American transfer student cuz blonde, blue eyed girls are cute. Also, some weird ass organization shrouded in mystery appears because why not? Aaaand that’s it so far. Additionally, there’s a plethora of super fun, engaging scenes consisting of random people giving excruciatingly long info dumps on nothing remotely interesting for what feels like hours. Ya love to see it. The anime also has the audacity to play unnerving horror-esque music that doesn’t fit the tone of the anime whatsoever. Do the creators actually think that the narrative is &quot;deep&quot; or &quot;intriguing&quot; or something? The only thing scary about this show is the generally terrible anatomy of the characters. Their abnormal body proportions are super horrifying!<br />
<br />
Tatsuya’s sister is here again in order to praise her brother for being the most ideal person on the planet, and that’s it. Nice to see that she still has a lot of depth! The other members of the cast return as well, and it was great to see them again since I got to shout “WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE!?” because I forgot everything about them. Fun stuff. It was also informative to learn that they still leave no impression on me whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Yeah, I just can’t continue with this anime. You may question why I even bothered to pick this up when I disliked its predecessor, but hey, I like to have hope that things can get better…they didn’t get better. Well, I hope everyone else watching can enjoy this more than me!<br />
<br />
You may think that I’m dropping this anime because it’s one of the dullest and most uninspiring shows in existence, but you are TOTALLY wrong. No, I’m simply humiliated by my utter lack of manhood when compared to Tatsuya’s greatness, and in my chagrin can no longer bear to watch anymore until I prove my worth through vigorous manly training. <br />
<br />
Don&#039;t watch...because this anime is clearly too advanced for mere peasants like myself.

    If there’s any one anime, any one popular anime in particular, I could say is feasibly written by an AI scrolling the algorithm, it would be The Irregular at Magic High School. Why so?<br />
<br />
Because the show does not have a spec of human emotion in it.<br />
<br />
Ignorance is the word of the day here folks. It was fairly apparent in the first season of Mahouka, and somehow even moreso here. Every aspect in this season, from the narrative, to the soundtrack, to the characterization, to the tension, to the worldbuilding is divorced from what’s commonly viewed as respectable. It’s not quite as insultingly awful as Season

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370014">
        1, but it does repeat a lot of similar failures, and even amplifies other parts. It saddens me that out of every show in the mostly dead genre of magic high school power fantasies (except perhaps the Index franchise), THIS ONE was the breakout hit that came to spread holiday depression by amplifying all its worst traits.<br />
<br />
To say this season has a “plot” would be massively overselling it. Things “happen”, but little lasts to any degree. An American secret agent girl named Angelina Shields drops in to stop “vampires” from draining magic from faceless NPCs in a world we’re given no reason to care about. She uses a disguise, and the show tries to build intrigue of what’ll happen to her and her rivalry with Tatsuya and Miyuki. Which might’ve been something………….unless of course you watched the film, which came out three years before this season, immediately giving away what happens to her. Oops. Oh, and then the last two episodes try very badly to make some point about discrimination with the worst racism allegory since RWBY’s White Fang.<br />
Many fundamental problems with the core premises of Mahouka return this season (except the magic system issues that’s just ignored), and they tend to affect the new elements when it wants to branch out a bit. <br />
<br />
The new element they want to highlight the most is Angelina. A top ranked American superspy with a secret identity, the show actually tries to give her feelings, and a goal she wants to accomplish, something seemingly foreign to Mahouka. But what’s the show’s reaction? Treat her like an absolute joke.<br />
<br />
Most of the “comedy” revolves around her constant incompetence in her job, mostly the lazy chibi comedy that feels bafflingly out of place for how solemnly serious it wants to be. The show can’t go one episode without having Tatsuya, the All-Knowing Übermensch, snip out that she’s sus, yet the camera still focuses on her devious smirk. By Episode 4, she duels Miyuki, and is on the verge of handily losing, Miyuki seemingly portrayed like a villain. Then, for the rest of the arc, Tatsuya and Miyuki effectively do her job for her, rather than giving her the chance to actually grow or change with any renewed confidence. A show with thought or effort put into it might’ve made her seem more like a competent rival, or at least have compelling payoff for running into Tatsuya and Miyuki, but no! Can’t let anyone get anything out of Tatsuya and Miyuki, the incesty power couple of modern anime. No one wins here. Fans of her character don’t get to see her actually prove her competence or get meaningful development, and fans of Tatsuya and Miyuki don’t have some sort of rival that can in any way enhance their growth. And it makes America look stupid for having someone like her headline their team.<br />
<br />
Not that Tatsuya and Miyuki look any better. Oh, the show tries to FOOL you into thinking there’s character development, but it’s a lie that means nothing. Miyuki is still one of anime’s most poorly written characters, with no personality besides loving her brother and being jealous of anyone else who gets near him. This could work if she was an antagonistic figure that stretched her love for her brother through drastic actions, but no, deuteragonist keeping the status quo. The show will claim there’s an arc of her losing attachment to her brother by having her monologue about it, which bears no fruit, and is partially demonstrated by the camera ogling her. After all, the chart says that fanservice sells, why not show more of the female and none of the character?! <br />
<br />
Mahouka: We&#039;re a super serious science conspiracy anime about secret agents, political drama and magic parasites!<br />
<br />
Also Mahouka: Let&#039;s have two separate scenes of women undressing for the camera, once for goofy comedy and once for drama with no foundation or worth that&#039;s really just fanservice anyway. Also let&#039;s give him a tagalong girl no personality whatsoever besides being another tsundere for Tatsuya with inexplicably magic hair beads.<br />
<br />
Aniplex: Perfect! Get it into production immediately!<br />
<br />
The ignorance never ends.<br />
<br />
Tatsuya smiles more, but he’s only slightly more tolerable than the previous season. In Episode 5, there’s a plot involving a rogue parasite that the show tries to act like has tension, but the cast has the answer to every hitch there could be. Tatsuya admits he could&#039;ve solved the problem for good, but didn&#039;t, thus prolonging the runtime. Genius. Another episode tries to act like he missed some detail about Angelina, but he gets the info he wants almost instantaneously just by phoning a few people. It’s lip service to the idea of conflict. The blatant author worship continues; a parasite powering a robot by someone’s love for him clung to him like they’re trapped in a spiderweb. Nearly everyone wants to get a Valentines gift specifically for him. Miyuki and Tatsuya spend the series feeding off everything else; ironically for a plot about stopping possessive parasites, that’s exactly what the leads are, the algorithm too ignorant to admit it.<br />
 <br />
Less than two minutes after Tatsuya loses his arm, he instantly gets it back. We can’t have TWO MINUTES of tension in this show. And don’t worry about the vampire plot; it’s solved instantaneously when the utterly unmemorable leader shows his face and can easily be put on hold for a Valentines’ Day episode, which is the only time the show has a pulse of life in it.<br />
<br />
As if the cherry on this shit cake wasn’t placed yet, you get the last two episodes. Radical magicians forming in response to discriminatory boycotts from the ordinary humans who claim (race) superiority enact terrorist attacks against magician slavery……something never seen and of no value since all the main characters are magicians. Of course, none of them have any actual point that causes the main characters to question anything, or have the charisma of say, the villains in Die Hard. This would be like if The Hunger Games was from the perspective of the capitalists on top……………do I even need to say what’s wrong with that?<br />
<br />
Everything else? Well, Erika’s the only returning side character allowed to have half a personality but it doesn’t matter any, and no one else even gets that much. There&#039;s a girl who looks like a China Doll that.....exists I guess? The animation is decent; nothing exceptional but without a single memorable action scene, but it fixed the first season’s color grading issue while maintaining a clean look, and the soundtrack is poorly mixed. Most of it is unmemorable dubstep techno, but Episode 9 tries to have a rap go along with it that’s super drowned out by the dialogue and action sfx. There’s so little to attach yourself to in this series.<br />
<br />
Mahouka confuses me, it really really does. I’ve seen bad anime aplenty that set clear goals for themselves and fail at them, but I’ve hardly seen an anime be so antithetical to everything about basic storytelling. Even series like SAO can pass off as fantasy adventure stories with kernels of depth, some icky scenes and the occasional bit of earned emotion. Mahouka can’t even do THAT. It’s a bevy of mismanaged priorities and “things people like” stuck in perpetually constant status quo with protagonists that have such a foothold over everything else that they’d be perfect villains in another work. I try to imagine the visions of the creators when watching anime, and there’s nothing here. A super serious science anime with botched attempts at political drama, that’s also stuck with incest pandering, fanservice, and childish comedy. It wants to be everything at once throughout its the 4 and a half hours, and accomplishes nothing. Appeal exists in media, even bad media, but Mahouka stands as a narratively backwards empty shell only notable for its failings.

<br />
Honestly, I am surprised that I did not enjoy this. I love power fantasy anime and this is that. I also liked the first season but for reason I did not enjoy this. This did have nice animation, good voice acting and a banger opening but for some reason I did not enjoy at all.<br />
<br />
Story: Some ships were bombed by a mystery person who was like one of the main characters. Then Tatsuya did some epic things and fights happened. Then some mystery foe which I don&#039;t remember what it was but there was some fighting with them<br />
<br />
Characters: Mostly bland. Tatsuya is just your average

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370024">
        power fantasy mc so he is cool, different than everyone else and strong as heck. Miyuki is still the same annoying piece of shit she always was with even more Brother complex. She needs to not exist. Angelina was cool tho. Others were the same as usual<br />
<br />
Ost: Ost was good and the opening nice.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend? No<br />

    Finally, the long anticipated return of one of the best LN franchises of all time to the anime medium. Mahouka does not disappoint at all in its second season and if anything, 8bit have taken the series to new heights.<br />
<br />
I’ve spoken for weeks about how Mahouka is clear of any other anime this season. I stand by that statement with this review as well. It was by far my favourite show of the season and if you enjoyed the first season, you will love this. When Mahouka switched from Madhouse to 8bit, I was a bit skeptical about how they would handle adapting the series.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370005">
        The visitor arc is a fan favourite of the series and sets up a lot of important things for the rest of the series. Luckily, 8bit didn’t miss a beat, and even surpassed Madhouse in many respects.<br />
<br />
 Adaptation wise, I think 8bit were pretty faithful to the LN’s. With Mahouka, one of the things that makes it so adored is its highly detailed magic system and world. It’s not a series for people who just want to see fights and cool animation. This is really for people who are looking to sink their teeth into some complex ideas. The visitor arc itself deals with some really complex issues that 8bit did a really good job of explaining adequately in a way that Light Novel readers and first time viewers could appreciate. I think the pacing and direction in general were top notch and felt that all the key details were left in.<br />
<br />
While Mahouka does focus on a lot of politics, magic systems and other character interaction type things, it does have fights. And when those fights happen, they are really well choreographed by 8bit in this season. I thought the animation was really solid during several of the big fight scenes this season. I also think the OST is even better than season 1 this time around. <br />

In conclusion, if you are at all a fan of the series or enjoyed the first season, you will love Mahouka season 2. It takes everything in season 1 and makes it even better. If you did not like Mahouka season 1, have issues with the “incest” vibes, etc. Just save your time, you know this isn’t for you. Mahouka season 2 gets 10 out of 10.

    DISCLAIMER: THIS IS THE SECOND SEASON OF MAHOUKA KOUKOUSEI NO RETTOUSEI, SO ONLY IF YOU HAVE MANAGED TO SURVIVE THE FIRST SEASON AND WANT TO SUFFER SOME MORE, WATCH THIS SEASON( I am suffering a lot)<br />
<br />
sigh....... I for the love of god can&#039;t got interested in this goddamn show and  it&#039;s not like I am very conservative with my anime preferences, I enjoyed and highly rated many unpopular anime. I have tried so hard, and had so much hope for when I first started watching it, but all that hope was drained out by ep 5. This time I had come back with some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361253">
        new hope( didn&#039;t have much of it tho), I thought that the season 2 must have some really interesting stuff if they are going to adapt it, right?<br />
WRONG<br />
By the end of ep 2, I was done with this show, so you might be wondering why am I still watching it. It&#039;s my challenge for the fall, to watch this whole show and I plan to finish it( i think).<br />
<br />
The story is about some American coming to investigate the &#039;incident that occurred in Japan, and coincidently there also seems to be a crime syndicate that has suddenly gone active. Nothing catching my interest here.<br />
<br />
I hate the art of Mahouka(it could be a big reason why I hate the show too), none of the characters have any life in them and lack a lot of facial emotions.<br />
<br />
The characters are boring af, with no unique personality or habit that seems amusing or has any interesting features. I couldn&#039;t give 2 shits about Onii sama or any of the other over powered people.<br />
<br />
I am not planning to recommend this show to anyone and for the safety of my own sanity hope that this show would get better in the future episodes.

    So how does the next part of this show go so far? Let&#039;s see...<br />
<br />
So far the story has been quite interesting and very tense. Something that I can really give this show props. They know how to set up an interesting, and tension filled kind of story, which will grab the watcher, and get them to keep watching. Following a new kind of strong foe, along with a sense of mystery around them, and one of our newest characters.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, the characters are as what you would expect them to be from the previous series. But the new girl in particular, she&#039;s a welcome

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361270">
        and fun edition to this case. I for one, cannot wait to see more of her as the show continues. <br />
<br />
The art is top notch much like the previous series. Though I&#039;d say it looks even more well done in this series, as if it&#039;s been touched up a fair bit, and looks way better than it previously did.  Much like the sound is good too. It&#039;s action packed, and really good there.<br />
<br />
I can say for sure, it&#039;s off to a wonderful start, and I can see it continuing to do well.

    Ok I&#039;m not even going to try to justify to myself why I decided to watch this in the first place. Honestly save yourself the hassle of adding this to your PTW list because it is a waste of time and just bad ... like objectively just atrocious.<br />
<br />
I remember moderately enjoying the first season since I watched the first season when  I had just gotten into anime and when I watched it, I was watching a lot of isekai power fantasy -ish type of anime and this series fit the bill. Retrospectively the whole thing is pretty bad. <br />
<br />
Overall it has the plot of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370053">
        a shitty &#039;win&#039;cest hentai without any of the sex scenes, so you&#039;re just sitting there awkwardly looking at two siblings awkwardly oozing sexual tension. Honestly the plot is secondary to this weird wincest dynamic that is going on. This would be a decent hentai .... Other than that there isn&#039;t much to say. The characters are all as bland as white bread (maybe I shouldn&#039;t even say that as it is kind of insulting to white bread). Yea ... Just don&#039;t watch it, there are many hentai out there with the same concept, better plot and actual sex scenes ...

    WARNING: *CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS* (Spoilers that don&#039;t really tell much about the actual story, but sort of tell some minor events that happened)<br />
<br />
     The synopsis gave a fairly good explanation in my opinion, but honestly, I don&#039;t think the synopsis goes into enough detail. They should&#039;ve added: &quot;Comes with an OP and bland protagonist, super annoying little sister that can&#039;t stop thinking of her brother, and super boring fight scenes&quot;. <br />
<br />
     This anime constantly makes me cringe, a feeling I just hate getting watching an anime. I&#039;m mostly about the &#039;nostalgic&#039; feeling, you know, the feeling that&#039;d

          <span style="display: none;" id="review364962">
        get you to watch the anime again, or at least get you thinking: &quot;Man, did I miss that anime!&quot; when you&#039;re thinking about it again? Yeah, no. This anime does the complete opposite for me if I were being honest. From the dubstep-like battle music, to Tatsuya just constantly getting crushed on by every girl he meets, to Miyuki constantly just wanting to fuck her brother, this anime always manages to mentally boom me, and causes me to just die inside. Funny enough, the main reason I actually dropped this anime as a whole was because of Miyuki actually thinking in her mind: &quot;No way am I going to marry anyone other than my brother&quot;. That&#039;s when my brain just clicked, and knew I had enough. <br />
<br />
     Story-wise, the anime manages to do the same thing: mentally boom me, but in another way (as if I wasn&#039;t mentally boomed already). The way the story &#039;mentally booms me&#039; is how many fillers there are. Mahouka is very slow paced in terms of story. By that I mean, it constantly has fillers explaining the world and what&#039;s happening. The story takes way too much time trying to explain everything, resulting in just constant boredom. This part luckily had less fillers, but was still quite boring trying to follow the story. I was quite excited for this new antagonist girl, since they seemed quite strong. &quot;Maybe they&#039;re as OP as Tatsuya, and they get to finally have a good battle?&quot; is what I thought what happen, but of course, like everything good I think of happening in this anime, that proved to be wrong as well. I mean, yeah, she is quite broken in her own way, but she just can&#039;t handle the power of the almighty chad-suya. She just can&#039;t compete to him. Tatsuya is just too OP man. I honestly doubt that Tatsuya can get beaten by anyone in their universe if I were to be honest. It&#039;s just so boring watching every fight scene and just knowing: &quot;Yeah, I he&#039;s going to win&quot;. It&#039;s just not fun to watch at all. The new villain group didn&#039;t seem to prove much of a threat either. From what I observed while I was actually watching the series, Tatsuya can easily beat them. No doubt about it. Which again, makes them not even a threat whatsoever. Truly shows how overly perfect they&#039;re trying to make this guy. He&#039;s just too broken man. Where are the Mahouka patch notes? When is this guy ever going to get nerfed?<br />
<br />
     Another thing I would nerf would probably be Miyuki&#039;s desire to pound her brother&#039;s cheeks, cause honestly, I feel like that&#039;s the second biggest thing they should nerf alongside her brother&#039;s magic abilities. This is actually the main source of me cringing. The fight scenes don&#039;t really make me cringe, but they just make me bored. Miyuki&#039;s actual romantic love towards her brother though, yeah. That&#039;s what makes me cringe and internally scream. Most anime don&#039;t really over-do the whole &#039;bro-con&#039; concept all that much. Even if it does seem that way, they mostly just do it in a joking type way most of the time. But for this anime, you can throw all that out the window, cause I can really feel her desire to marry her brother and have children with him, and I mean REALLY. We are constantly reminded that Miyuki will just never accept another man to marry other than her brother. And I specifically remember in a certain fansubbed video, that she VERY CLEARLY says: &quot;Why did I have to be his sister?&quot;. It just infuriates me and makes me die inside every single time I&#039;m reminded of this fact for some reason. <br />
<br />
     Tatsuya is honestly a super bland and really boring MC honestly. He has zero emotions whatsoever. Receive 150x the amount of pain someone received? Doesn&#039;t even seem to bother him. If you ever feel like he might get embarrassed at a certain point in the anime? Yeah, no. The omega-chad-suya never gets embarrassed. He is the epitome of bland. He is just not fun to watch at all. For all I know, Mikihiko could even be a better protagonist than Tatsuya is honestly. At least he has emotions right?<br />
<br />
     The only really good parts of this anime are the sound and art in my opinion. The OP and ED were alright. The OP definitely sounds like an average shounen OP. It sort of gives off that kind of vibe, and it sounded alright, but not all that good either though. The ED is ok as well. Fairly relaxing and nice to listen to. Always liked relaxing EDs. They give off a nice and calming vibe to them. Both the OP and ED were mediocre. They weren&#039;t super bad though. The battle theme though, was not as good as the OP and ED were. The dub-step part of it just made me cringe again. The fight scenes were already pretty cringey in itself, so listening to the music just made it worse. I just did not like the battle theme compared to the rest of the songs in the OST. The art though, was actually pretty good. Probably the best thing about this anime. The art style is clean, and actually fits this type of anime. Fairly pleasing to the eye, and could probably lure some people in because of this. The art style was also the main reason I decided to watch the series as well, so it could probably get some other people watching as well. In a way, I do guess that there is some type of good in this series, even if it&#039;s just aesthetics at least. <br />
<br />
     Overall, I just think that the anime is not for me. If you were looking to get some insight on whether you should watch this anime or not, then I&#039;d say it depends on how well you can bear things. If you don&#039;t mind an overpowered protagonist with no personality, an annoying bro-con, and fight scenes already decided by Mr. Alpha-chad himself, then yeah. Go ahead, I won&#039;t judge you. Everyone has their own opinions anyway, and I&#039;m merely just voicing my own, so I won&#039;t really try to persuade you into thinking that it&#039;s a dumpster fire (even though I&#039;ll still think it is). However, if you do mind all that above, and are like me in terms of anime preference, then don&#039;t even bother trying to go near this one. I&#039;ve endured enough suffering and mental booming. I don&#039;t want any of the people reading this to endure this either.

    After 4 episodes all I can say it&#039;s just solid anime and I don&#039;t know why people just watch it to give it overall score 1 if it pains you to watch it then why you watch it? I mean there are people who follow blindfolded mainstream anime and praise everything which is good in other people opinion because it must be good... Like for example I&#039;m not that much into Shounens so what I should start watching One Piece just to drop it after few episodes give rating 1 and write angry review how it doesn&#039;t appeal to me?<br />
<br />
When I started watching anime I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361608">
        was teenager now at least my age says I&#039;m adult and I try to make my decisions like adult. While characters and story might not be good enough for some people I think art style and sound is top tier.<br />
<br />
Or to be even more blunt if I want RPG game I don&#039;t play FIFA.<br />
<br />
Like I said at begin so far this anime is solid story with slowly expanding plot which will end soon and we will get new arc or maybe two small ones who know. I just watch this anime for fighting scenes which I don&#039;t want to spoil for anyone reading this but for me this is where this anime shines when you watch fights you are really into them it&#039;s not like &quot;man another fight&quot; but with great background music I watch episodes and I wait for next fight, like what new spells we will see? or what new type of powers will enemy have? Every new fight is something important and it&#039;s not like wasting time to just fight someone.<br />
<br />
I waited for this anime really long the only thing which would make it better would be LiSA or GARNiDELiA opening/ending but well you can&#039;t have everything and that&#039;s all if you read through all this thank you and have a good day or night.

    I do understand why people hate it so much. The story is boring. To me, I like OP anime character since I have a lot of stressful work to do, so OP MC who shits on others is a win for me. I don&#039;t have to think about the fight as every fight boils down to &quot;How hard the MC shits on his/her opponents.&quot; I also like the &quot;I&#039;m smart and you&#039;re stupid so that&#039;s why you can&#039;t fight me.&quot; I&#039;m not saying the progression of the MC is bad but after a lot of anime with that, it starts to get boring. This kind

          <span style="display: none;" id="review364362">
        of anime is ok written. I give this season a 7 since I read the source material. The art fits with the style of the anime. That&#039;s an 8 from me. (points deducted because I don&#039;t like extra-sharp shin, though it&#039;s toned down from ss1) Some sound effects/music is weird to me, so that&#039;s a 6 for me. Character? easily 10+. Godsuya is the perfect OP MC IMO. Anos is too edgy(not necessarily a bad thing), Saitama is too dumb to abuse his power for influence(i know it&#039;s a comedy), etc. Enjoyment is also a 10+. it&#039;s fun to watch Tatsuya shits on others in a fight. Overall I give it a 9. The OP song is very nice. IMO it&#039;s on par with Rising Hope. The story is a little boring. If you enjoy the action in every episode this is not it. Art is good. Not the best but neither the worst.<br />
<br />
You can say it feeds my ego. Yes, yes it does and I love it!<br />
<br />
To those who say that it doesn&#039;t fully cover everything or nearly everything in the LN. I agree with you. I started reading the source materials after I finished the first season. Yes, the content in the anime is lacking world-building and some minor details but I think that it states enough information for the viewer to understand what&#039;s the story about and its origin.

    Whether or not you view this as a standalone work, or a sequel &amp; adaptation, it fails to hold up either way. The story and characters were never good, and that&#039;s fine, but it was an enjoyable magitech action show. This sequel, however, is way too much pretentious talking and not enough action. The sound is also some of the worst I&#039;ve ever heard, it&#039;s like they gave a 12 year old a soundboard of just royalty free new-age music. I usually don&#039;t notice sound/music too much, but it really stands out how terrible the sound is in this show.<br />

Overall, sucks ass and I&#039;m just

    I&#039;ve seen a lot of long reviews of this show but, to sum up the show in a sentence:<br />
<br />
IT&#039;S PRETTY MUCH A HENTAI PLOT WITH MAGIC, AND AN OP MC THAT ISN&#039;T HORNY SO THERE&#039;S NO SEX EVEN THOUGH HALF THE SHOW IS HIS LITTLE SISTER FANTISIZING ABOUT GETTING THAT ONICHAN D.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters- 1: Their all extremely flat, and only personality trait the female characters have is that have a crush on Mr. Shiba-kun.<br />
<br />
Story-1: OP MC that can&#039;t die and can block everyone&#039;s magic. The story is just him beating up everyone. And there&#039;s no need to care about any of the enemies, other characters, or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367376">
        fights because Tatsuya will never lose.<br />
<br />
Art-6: What you expect from any new anime- pretty generic well animated art.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-4: I just wanted to watch a dumpster fire go down, but MAN was it hard to watch the weird sister-brother dynamic.<br />
<br />
Overall 3-Just go watch hentai or an actual anime, both are better. the show turned out worse than I had expected.<br />
<br />

Ladies and gentlemen, He is BACK! Grab on to a clean pair of underwear, clench those buttcheeks, straps yourselves to your vests and glue your eyes to your screen because you won&#039;t wanna miss what&#039;s next. He Man Himself has, after YEARS of absence, once again graced us peasants with his presence. He goes by many names - The Man, The Legend, Godsuya, Mansuya, Bro, Ani-Sama, Chad, xXx_NoobSlayer_xXx, but here people call him the Irregular at Magic High School. Enough

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370394">
        delaying, let&#039;s jump straight into his Holiness&#039; perfection.<br />
<br />
Story: 4<br />
Aliens.jpeg BUT they&#039;re from another dimension. And they are magical! And telepathical! And they don&#039;t use CADs! And they don&#039;t die when they are killed! And one of them has the hots for Mansuya (can&#039;t blame it tbh). And they want to destroy the world. But they made one grave miscalculation - they forgot about the existence of God himself in human form. This could and does end only one way for these unfortunate visitors.<br />
But apart from those slimy tentacle aliens, other groups, such as the USNA, the Sages, some terrorist groups, some Chinese mafia, as well as Japan&#039;s own military forces and backstage crime families decided to throw their hats into the fray. Sadly for them, they dared step foot into the domain of the Man himself and got rightfully clapped into submission. <br />
<br />
Art: 4<br />
No visual effects conceived and created by human beings can even try to represent the immeasurable perfection that is the existence of Mansuya! <br />
<br />
Sound: 4<br />
The only sounds worthy of being associated with His Holiness are the sounds he himself makes when he educates the unwashed masses, as well as the lamentation of his defeated foes.<br />
<br />
Characters: 4<br />
There is only One character worth mentioning in this Anime and He is written in the very title. But being the humble and gracious Master that He is, He allows the the existence of additional humans in his presence. So let&#039;s go through some of the disposable meat sacks that tag along.<br />
We have the big breasted megane girl that can see things, the spiritual guy that uses spirits, the big breasted twintail girl who thirsts over our Chad, the short haired kuudere that also secretly, most likely thirsts after Him, the redhead tomboy with medium breasts, the tall, muscular but brainless punching bag jock, the plethora of irrelevant walking CO2 factories, the majority of who also thirst for Godsuya, some black-eyes grandpa, some big breasted, big haired aunt, some blue eyed blond twintailed big breasted american exchange student, and, of course, the big breasted little sister. They one and only purpose in this anime is to contrast the ideal image of the gracious and wonderful Mansuya with their imperfections and mortality.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8 <br />
Do you enjoy seeing one character literally stomp the ever-living hell out of his adversaries. Do you enjoy seeing a justified harem? Do you enjoy seeing God himself descend upon humanity and repair a 2000+ meter high building in a split second WITH HIS MIND? Do you enjoy long, made-up science jibberish being shoved down your ungrateful throat? Then you have made the right choice by picking this anime!<br />
<br />
Overall: 5 <br />
If this anime consisted of Tatsuya and Tatsuya only, the score would have been a perfect 10/10. Unfortunately, he is forced to mingle with a contingent of mortal rabble on a daily basis, who&#039;s only redeeming quality is being a stepping stone for Him!

    Disclaimer: I am writing this review as someone who had not read the light novel and only watched the anime series. <br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
<br />
MAHOUKA KOUKOU NO RETTOUSEI: RAIHOUSHA-HEN is a continuation of the first season of the MAHOUKA KOUKOU NO RETTOUSEI. Personally, I really find the story of Mahouka a mess. Season 2 begins with a transfer student by the name Lina. Lina is actually a major of the USNA and a very skilled assassin. With her entry, unusual events that involve casualties happen in Japan. The beginning of the story quite sparked my interest, however, as the story proceeded, it was just an absolute clusterfuck.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review366296">
        There were tons of information bomb for things that are not of significant importance to the story. Aside from that, there are multiple times where the motives for the actions of the characters are just too shallow. I tried to give the series a chance by making it past episode 9. But in Episode 9, there is still no significant progress in the story. The progress that occurred from EP 1 to EP9 can be done in around 2-3 episodes. For some reason, there are a lot of fillers and really irrelevant scenes. I don&#039;t even know what&#039;s happening right now. There is no congruence or direction on where the story is going. What happens is that a new event occurs, then, Tatsuya resolves the issue and shows his abilities and repeat. Everything just revolves around Tatsuya. <br />
<br />
Art - 7/10<br />
<br />
Perhaps this is the best part of the anime. The art is well drawn. The fighting scenes and the magic effects were well-detailed and animated.  However, there is a noticeable lack of facial expressions and emotions on the characters. I know that some of them are &quot;intentional&quot; because Tatsuya is emotionless due to the experiment, but, there are multiple instances where other characters don&#039;t have the right expression for the moment.<br />
<br />
Sound - 7/10<br />
<br />
MAHOUKA KOUKOU NO RETTOUSEI: RAIHOUSHA-HEN contains prominent voice actors in the industry such as Sora Amamiya, Hayami Saori and Kana Hanazawa. By seeing these names, we can be reassured that the voice acting of the characters will definitely be on point. My only issue with the sound is that the background music sometimes do not fit for the scene where it plays. There are multiple instances where the BGM is just really off. <br />
<br />
Characters - 2/10<br />
<br />
Aside from the plot, this is probably the biggest weakness of MAHOUKA KOUKOU NO RETTOUSEI: RAIHOUSHA-HEN. The characters are too one-sided, the decision making of the characters does not align with the personality of the characters, and EVERYTHING IS JUST FOCUSED AROUND TATSUYA. <br />
<br />
Character development is &quot;shown&quot; by Tatsuya when he start to worry about his friends and wants to get revenge for them. Because Tatsuya is &quot;emotionless&quot;, Miyuki was gladdened by this small seed of emotions in his brother. Personally, I really don&#039;t find that character development very promising. In the first place, does he even need friends? With his superhuman godlike ability and intelligence, does he even need anyone? Also, I get that this is one of the bro-con type of anime, but Miyuki&#039;s dependence and affection for his brother is on par on the modern day &quot;psychotic girlfriend&quot; level. From the way things are portrayed, the other characters are just introduced if Tatsuya needs them or if they have interaction with Tatsuya. They are like &quot;tools&quot; of Tatsuya. They do not grow as an individual on their own knowing this is already the 2nd season of the anime. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 3/10<br />
<br />
Unlike Season 1 where I was able to somehow enjoy the series due to Tatsuya&#039;s display of skills and revelation of true identity, Season 2 was pretty underwhelming. For the first 9 episodes, it was really painful to watch. I tried my best to give it a chance by watching one more episode. But, the anime just keeps going further and further away from the main plot. Imagine this, this series is only just 13 episodes but we are already 9 episodes in and we are yet to see the big picture of the story. Seriously, what the heck is going on? Do I need to read the light novel to get what is happening? If I need, then, this is seriously a bad anime adaptation. <br />
<br />
Overall - 4/10<br />
<br />
I am not a hater of MAHOUKA KOUKOU NO RETTOUSEI: RAIHOUSHA-HEN, I just find it really bad to be honest. While some people find this enjoyable, unfortunately, this is not my cup of tea. Very slow progress on the story and just continuous &quot;information bomb&quot; of irrelevant information. I really thought that season 2 will be very promising but unfortunately, it is not. I would not recommend MAHOUKA KOUKOU NO RETTOUSEI: RAIHOUSHA-HEN for people like me who like plot driven stories and series that focuses on character developments. Imagine 9 episodes and we are yet to see any MAJOR Progress on the story. I do not know how things went for the light novel but the anime adaptation is seriously a big disappointment. <br />
<br />
OVERALL, if you plan to watch MAHOUKA KOUKOU NO RETTOUSEI: RAIHOUSHA-HEN, I personally do not recommend this show. Save yourself from the same mistake I did.

    I dont know how this anime even got released when the only things characters do is literally tell the plot and explain every and any point you see on screen to another character. All the viewer does is just wait for any of the characters to spawn on screen to dump exposition and then cease to exist after.... The action is only there to prove to you something bad is happening. <br />
<br />
I mean... I get it... Its built to mildly entertain its audience and thats it. But it barely manages that. <br />
No surprise if the fans get mad or hate on this review because asking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365706">
        for more effort to be put in a show for the sake of the fans and audience is an outrageous thought, and that I watch shows because i want them to be bad... <br />
<br />
I was looking forward to what theyd do with this show (dont know why now) but all it did was sh*t in my mouth and tell me to enjoy it... And well, I didnt.

    Alright, hear me out. I rarely leave reviews and I completely understand why some people is hating on this anime. However, let’s not bring this anime down because it does not suit your taste. Mahouka is back with season 2 and it’s a blast. Storyline is interesting with somewhat lacking major plot points from the novel. The art is amazing considering it been move to a lower art studio. With that said, I do want to address that the love complex between the main characters in this anime. I do not support incest in any types of way. However,  giving the context of this

        story, which happens in the vert far future, in a fictional world with magic and gene mutation. It is understandable mutated siblings might develop emotion towards each other. With that said, I do not want to spoil to those haven’t read the light novel but I do want to tell you that Tatsuya and Myuki is not completely related. Not saying it is okay to be with your siblings but given the context it is understandable.

    Art and sound plus a pathetic plot with nothing but god moding Tatsuya and sister with a major crush on him even though he has zero personality and she barely does herself? Yeah no, this is just bad.<br />
<br />
I watched every episode that aired in Japan so far and I haven&#039;t found it that interesting. There&#039;s a bunch of action but the plot is boring and there&#039;s never any real danger. They also god mode so much that apparently one of the &quot;worlds greatest&quot; mages still doesn&#039;t stand a ghost of a chance against either Tatsuya or his sister which is just boring. Can&#039;t knock the

    1. Story is fine, but I guess you have to read manga to properly understand. I dont say, you are not able to understand, but its like watching with limited vision. You have to pay attention, there is lot of talking.<br />
2. Art is good and animations too. There is not much I can criticize, but i would appreciate longer fights with more action<br />
3. sound/music is really bad. It made painful to watch some scenes and this sound was one of my worst experience for a long time. But that&#039;s the matter of taste and I didn&#039;t really like it<br />
4. characters are average. they had not

        very visible aspects of personality. Maybe it&#039;s because the story supposed to be serious, but the true is, I didn&#039;t really felt attach to characters. But it&#039;s not like, they are bad either<br />
<br />
Over all, I did enjoyed some parts and some parts not. If you like complex story with magic and action, you are free to watch this. For me, only if you have nothing to watch, you can give it a chance
