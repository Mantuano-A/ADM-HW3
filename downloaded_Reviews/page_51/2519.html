    &quot;What&#039;s the point of dirty jokes anyway if they aren&#039;t &#039;wrong&#039;? They&#039;re appealing *because* they are wrong. They excite us *because* we have to be secretive. Because they&#039;re devilish, they shine. Because they&#039;re twisted, they entice us. That is why I vowed to become the &#039;devil&#039; to crush this boring world where the concept of dirty jokes does not exist!&quot; – Kajou Ayame<br />
<br />
At first glance this may sound like a pretty stupid quote, but when you think about it there&#039;s a lot of truth behind it. In fact, Shimoneta as a whole functions in more or less the same way as underneath the hyperactive, wacky

          <span style="display: none;" id="review198918">
        comedy there are a lot of shots fired not only against many societal norms, but also the censorship laws of Japanese media.<br />
<br />
First thing first though: let&#039;s be honest here, how many people actually thought this was going to be a good anime before this season started airing? My guess is not so many, but Shimoneta came roaring seemingly completely out of nowhere and proved itself as one of the funniest comedies I&#039;ve ever seen in anime, but also one of the strangest ones. The setting is honestly pretty similar to 1984 of all things, as it features a totalitarian, dystopian society with heavy governmental censorship. In this case however, the censorship is solely about sexual content. In fact all forms of pornography, sexual education, or anything along those lines has been completely banned from society for the last decade, and every citizen is forced to wear a vocal monitor at all times which summons the police to arrest them should they ever say a dirty word. Enter Kajou Ayame, a.k.a. the lewd terrorist “Blue Snow&quot;, a self-proclaimed freedom fighter who distributes sexual material wherever she goes in an attempt to educate people. Alongside our unfortunate protagonist Okuma Tanukichi whom she blackmails into assisting her, the two of them initiate a campaign of obscenities against the government with the hopes of one day managing to reform society to what it once was.<br />
<br />
I could go on for days talking about the utter lunacy of Shimoneta, but I&#039;d rather just recommend you to experience it for yourself as there is no way you can properly express its sheer absurdness with mere words. All I&#039;ll say is that it although it is fairly uneven, when it peaks it&#039;s without a doubt one of the best comedies ever.<br />
<br />
What is definitely worth talking about though is the underlying message that the show is very clearly trying to send. After all, in a nutshell the entire story is essentially about fighting against the government&#039;s violation of freedom of speech and getting rid of all forms of censorship throughout society. It doesn&#039;t exactly take a genius to figure out what the author is trying to say with that. I&#039;m pretty sure most people who watch anime on a regular basis are very familiar with just how severe the censorship can be for it. Whether it&#039;s about gore, sexual themes or anything else, there are always tons of things that have to be left out. Not only does this hinder the authors&#039; and illustrators&#039; ability to express themselves properly, but it can also severely neuter the experience for the series&#039; viewers. And really, in this day and age even a kid can access essentially anything via the internet, so it&#039;s not like you&#039;re actually “protecting&quot; anyone from graphical content by blocking it out anyway, not to mention that if someone didn&#039;t want to see that kind of stuff they wouldn&#039;t be watching the anime in question in the first place, censored or not. Shimoneta feels a lot like an author who had gotten fed up with the current system and who decided to write this story out of spite. Whether or not that is actually the case I do not know, but the fact that there are a lot of political messages in this story is undeniable. Although if it&#039;s really true that the author came up with the idea for Shimoneta when he was drunk like he claims to, then that only makes the whole thing even more peculiar.<br />
<br />
Either way, regardless of whether you&#039;re watching this anime for the absurd comedy or the underlying messages, Shimoneta does a great job at both. It stands out as one of the most positively surprising anime I have seen in an extremely long time, and it will be remembered for being both hilarious and thought-provoking at the same time. Not many series can boast with that achievement.<br />
<br />
Now sadly I don&#039;t really think the awareness that Shimoneta might raise will be enough to do anything about the censorship laws in Japan, but at least it stands up for itself and dares to make a statement. It&#039;s a step in the right direction at the very least, and I can only hope that more series will have the guts to do the same in the future.

    &quot;Nothing is disgusting....nothing&quot; - Okuma, episode 12<br />
<br />
Shimoneta and Prison School have got to be the dirtiest and lewd shows this season, or this year. But Shimoneta sucks and Prison School is far superior. Why do I say this about two shows that are about on par in sexual content? Well then, read the review.<br />
<br />
Shimoneta&#039;s premise is that all that is lewd and sexual has been banned for over a decade, and any use of sexual things via words, or objects will get you into legal trouble. Now our &#039;heroes&#039; are off to fight a war and take back the justice which is all that is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review198962">
        erotic that Japan is in dire need of. I hate this show not because it has ass and titties and panties...and other sex stuff, it&#039;s because of the characters poorly delivered dialogue, development, and just plain character. The story has no connected ideas, it&#039;s goes from point A to Point C, D, and B. Our cast is going around spreading erotic pictures and magazines to spread knowledge of the ignorance the country is in. The end of the series doesn&#039;t resolve anything really. There is this supposed huge conflict against the government baddies that&#039;s hardly ever explored, and the other terrorist organizations who are barely mentioned or shown for 2 seconds. The idea of the show is good, it&#039;s loosely reflected upon Japan&#039;s lack of sexual interaction among the young people with the declining Japanese population. But just because the idea behind the story is good, doesn&#039;t mean the execution is the same.<br />
<br />
Shimoneta prizes itself with its pathetic characters who have no range nor substance. There is a complete lack of immersion and characterization. Okuma is every FUCKING reluctant brown hair male archetype, who is so plain and unoriginal, he has no quality to him. Any of the four boys from Prison School would&#039;ve made a better protagonist. While Okuma is a terrible main character, Kajou has it worse. A character with substantial motivation and promise only to be hindered by her vastly pointless use of dialogue to spout unnecessary lewd words for the sake of it. You can&#039;t go one fucking sentence without her saying dick, just because. &quot;Oh but it&#039;s the point of the show&quot;.......no, that shit is just bad writing. There are times where her lewd talk is appropriate in the situation but that&#039;s already when you&#039;re tired of her speaking. Additionally, Kajou&#039;s characterization and development is nonexistent. Actually, no character in the show has development, at all. Essentially, what we get is a plot that achieves nothing substantial enough to justify the span of 12 episodes. <br />
<br />
Dialogue in general is terrible, TURRIBLE. It is unashamedly cheesy, while it should be ashamed, for how immature it handles immature use of sexual content. And it fails miserably. The comedy is just more dick and pussy jokes that get tiring really fast. Even for someone, myself, does the same thing, I don&#039;t expect that kind of amateur writing in entertainment. Other characters such as Anna is completely defiled as a one dimensional sex obsessed freak in the most annoying way possible. She&#039;s not Sarutobe Ayume from Gintama who actually is far better and actually funny, being obsessed with Gintoki just as much, just not as lewd and disgusting (nothing is disgusting). Even Tsukimigusa who has a sort of might not be interesting back story to him, it&#039;s totally under utilized. The only real character I enjoyed was White Peak. Somehow he didn&#039;t bother me, he was actually the epitome of what this show could&#039;ve been. I loved every moment of his character, and then he&#039;s gone, forever. Sad times it is.<br />
<br />
I have nothing bad to say about the art, it&#039;s fine. Subjective? I guess, whatever. I suppose you could say the sound in the show is good. Voice acting is well done and it sort of conveys the characters and setting until the characterization of the characters ruins it.<br />
<br />
This show is a bile of sticky white love nectar, earning itself a 3/10. It&#039;s a dick of show that can shove itself up it&#039;s own ass. Get it?! AHAHAHAHA...it&#039;s not funny. This show killed what potential that could be sexual humor in the next stage of evolution. But I think that statement is a far stretch. This show is off the charts of shows I can recommend and earns my shitty of shit face seal of approval.

    Oh boy ,where do i start.. i&#039;ll just get this out of the way ,i&#039;m not gonna talk about the underlying messages and all that ,ill leave that for someone else to do, and i won&#039;t compare it to other shows.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll be quick and straight to the point ,this show delivers what it promises  which is just dirty jokes throughout the whole show and if you were expecting something else well ,i&#039;m not really sure what you&#039;re doing watching it.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t talk about the story ,it&#039;s just there to hold the show together.<br />
If you think otherwise, well everyone has their opinion, i won&#039;t judge.<br />
<br />
Ok

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201107">
        moving on ,art is pretty avarage, sound is underwhelming and the characters are just to generic ,but somewhat lovable regardless of how generic.<br />
<br />
Now for the part that really matters to me and you my personal enjoyment, well &#039;&#039;I&#039;m a simple man with some retarded complications&#039;&#039; so i enjoy stupid jokes no matter how bad or childish they are , shimoneta is not a show to keep you hooked with its story or art or anything else.<br />
Its sole purpose is just like i mentioned before which is make as much perverted jokes as it can , and it did so and i respect that commitment.<br />
Overall i give it a 4 not because it&#039;s good in terms of what it brought to the table but because it&#039;s enjoyable, and that&#039;s what we look for in an anime right?<br />
So if you&#039;re like me and like you&#039;re fair share of stupid dirty jokes go ahead and watch it.<br />
<br />
And if you&#039;re asking for a more indepth review of me talking about the producer staff and all ,i can&#039;t really say much, they deliver what they set the show out to be so they did a good job i guess?<br />
<br />
Either way this was also my 1st review so i do apologize if it was bad or not to your liking ,and if u did manage to read through all of that which i sure didn&#039;t ,thanks man/dude/friend/person and keep being awesome<br />

    Every season, there’s usually one or a few series that you can’t watch with your family like your little brother/sister or parents. Keep that in mind if you plan to watch this show.<br />
<br />
Now imagine this: <br />
A world where anything lewd, obscene, or considered “sexual” is banned. And any attempts to practice such acts of obscenity can land you into jail. In Shimoseka, that’s actually a reality. The government has apparently imposed their laws onto the public to obstruct any sort of obscene behavior. This also apparently includes sex education so children can forget about learning the logics of pregnancy, sexual abstinence, and all that other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199112">
        stuff they teach you at school. At the center of the story, we have this young man named Tanukichi Okuma. His initial goal was to find Anna Nishikinomiya, a girl that he has admired and has a crush on. Apparently, luck strikes and he not only manages to find her as part of the Student Council but also gets close to Anna like a twist of fate. Unfortunately, this also puts Okuma in a complicated story when he gets involved with Blue Snow, a terrorist who seeks to abolish censorship laws. After reading all of this, you’ll probably thinking...what the hell?<br />
<br />
That’s what I had thought at first anyways.<br />
<br />
The show isn’t shy on portraying its sexual themes. Its first few episodes easily establishes that committing lewd behavior is considered a capital crime. An example would be Okuma being hunted down by a group of public officers after being accused for obstructing justice with a “lewd act”. Despite lacking evidence, he is targeted anyways until he is saved by Blue Snow. The series also isn’t afraid to go far with its sex jokes such as heavily implied references that shows intercourse between flies. Blue Snow is also considered an infamous figure in their world with that signature panty on her head. In fact, there’s little normal about anything regarding this show. Even Anna, the girl he admires the most, awakens her “wild” side while we learn how over exaggerated the government tries to impose its laws on the citizens. So in other words, it sort of makes Okuma the only normal character in the series. <br />
 <br />
I would say Shimoseka is portrayed as more of a satire rather than anything to be taken as deep or serious. The way the government enforces its laws is similar to Big Brother from 1984. They are the eyes and are always watching you with their cameras, agents, and even “peace makers” which are apparently devices that monitors’ a person’s movements. If anything is done that is considered lascivious, you can guess what happens next. A show like this can seem to be over the top and offensive at times. There is also rape jokes that is satired by cartoonish censors and fan disservice. Every episode also pushes forward SOX (a parody of censorship for the word, sex) with their goal that becomes more extreme as the story progresses. Blue Snow, also known as Ayame Kajou, is the complete antithesis of what Japanese authorities are trying to enforce. She wears a panty over her head, throws lewd pictures in public, and wears an obscene outfit with little clothing underneath her white cloak. Other characters also becomes a joke itself with their personalities. Example such as Otome with her artistically talent in drawing lewd artwork, Hyouka Fuwa with her fascination in studying the human body and sex behavior, or Kosuri’s manipulative personality as a child. Okuma himself isn’t immune to lewd acts in the show. Time after time, it’s shown that he may secretly enjoy what Anna is doing with him. So in essence, every main character in the show becomes part of the formula. To say that a boring world where dirty jokes doesn’t exist is an overstatement. Dirty jokes weren’t invented in this series. They perfected it.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, the show’s comedy is crude on most parts. The story itself is mostly nonsense and considered a satire. Story arcs that involves terrorists or assaults are supposed to be taken as parodies although recurring tropes can quickly grow old. None of the characters get any sort of depth because the series is more focused on abolishing censorship rather than character growth. However, I will say that the characters’ roles can be quite entertaining to watch especially with how complicated some events can be. But when it all comes down to it, Shimoseka is a dirty joke of itself. It’s fun to watch for some comedy such as Anna’s batshit insane moments or public officials freaking out over the tiniest of lewd acts. If you’ve seen Seitokai Yakuindomo or something similar, then it’s easy to understand the intentions behind the show. <br />
<br />
The artwork for the series is pretty standard by J.C. Staff. Character designs for students are normal although when the story kicks in, everything becomes over the top. Censorship is played out as a joke with the cartoony drawings during inappropriate timings. Even certain words are blocked out as the show is seemingly self-aware of its premise. But as a show about dirty jokes, we do have quite a bit of ecchi moments ranging from Anna’s intense expression of her love towards Okuma or some of the character designs for Blue Snow. There’s also some mature content that is downsized by the satire involving sexual fluids and whatnot. The OP and ED theme song kind of go two folds. For one, it clearly satires the sexualization of the show. On the other hand, it’s also portrayed as upfront for fan service and nothing more. Most of the soundtrack is mediocre and easily forgettable. However, the character voice mannerism is easily recognizable such as Anna’s obscene moments or Blue Snow’s signature laughs. <br />
<br />
Some people are probably wondering “where were you when this hidden gem premiered?” Oh yeah, this is one of those series that looks, seems, and is funny at first. But over time, it can grow old, and not to mention offensive at times. Still, I will give a vibrant effort in the series for putting a sheer amount of effort in satirizing many of its ideas. Most of the time, fan service is portrayed as mindless and boring. But in this series, it’s played out more as a dirty joke like it should be. Now close your windows, lock your doors, and hope the neighbors don’t wake up when you watch this. <br />

    Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai was without a doubt one of the most unique comedy shows I watched and enjoyed during Summer 2015. It was full of energy and excitement, and most importantly a awesome and very memorable cast of characters. <br />
<br />
There are lots of shows that have the dirty jokes in school setting however, Shimoseka&#039;s version of this differs greatly. Most noticeable it&#039;s more childish and immature with dialogue but the characters discuss mature content... however the once you get used to the character.. (mostly Ayame Kajo&#039;s) personality it really starts to grow on you. I noticed it&#039;s material,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208221">
        or humor if you will, is also like watching a western cartoon like South park... to a certain extent of course. The dirty jokes and foul language are what the show is about so I do not want to complain too much about that. <br />
<br />
I personally felt that the story was again, unique and pretty good. You will pretty much get an idea of what it&#039;s about by reading the description so I shouldn&#039;t really have to explain... that aside what I liked about the story was it was consistent. What I mean by that is ordinarily shows similar to Shimoseka...  or focuses on too many things which in time makes the story bad. Where as in Shimoneta it focuses on one thing but with many goals, Like hiding dirty magazines in school, obtaining erotic items, etc.<br />
<br />
Artwork and character designs with the artwork I really appreciated seeing the cyber punk/futuristic setting and atmosphere that the show had. I noticed that lately there seems to be a larger increase of futuristic devices and technologies in anime&#039;s so shimoseka&#039;s wasn&#039;t really special, although I love the ideas of the PM&#039;s lol things were so bad... <br />
<br />
Character designs were something special too.. of all of the characters introduced designs that stood out most were Anna, mostly because of the artist unique choice of colours for her eyes, eyelashes, and hair. Lastly is of course is Ayame Kajo, whose school attire makes her look plain and geeky however when she transitions to her &quot;normal&quot; dirty joke loving self her appearance is much more loving. The rest are pretty good too.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack and BGM was alright... nothing too special. Music in the show sounded like pretty generic pieces put together to match the shows rhythm and situations. For example I noticed that if there was a very sexual situation going on faster and intense music would play to match the scene. As I mention before the show and the characters are full of energy... (expect for Fuwa.... those bags under her eyes tell it all.)<br />
<br />
My overall enjoyment with this series was pretty high. I found myself highly engaged, and sometimes annoyed with the problematic situations that occurred during my time watching it. Again, the energy the characters have and the fast pacing of the shows events make it really enjoyable so if you decide to watch it expect wild... no SUPER WILD moments or events... things get really crazy.<br />
<br />
My final thoughts are this, if you aren&#039;t interested in Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai then you can skip it, overall I would say that it isn&#039;t an anime that is worth sharing or recommending. I mean unless you&#039;re in a conversation with your friends or best mates about dirty comedies then be my guest. My overall score for it was 8/10 for being highly energetic, wonderful cast of characters, and in it&#039;s own unique  way creative. I&#039;m also look forward to reading the last LN being released this year... so that too.<br />

    Having finished all 12 episodes of Shimoneta, I have to say, this is one of the most pure comedy show I have seen in a long time.  On the surface, Shimoneta is a show about rebelling against a system that banned all dirty jokes.  Under the surface, Shimoneta is a show about rebelling a system that banned all dirty jokes.  In other words it stays true to itself throughout the series, which is rare nowaday since most shows try to teach some nonsensical life lesson.<br />
<br />
Story:  First of, this is one of the most ridiculous premise I&#039;ve ever seen for an ero-comedy.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review198920">
         Does that make it less enjoyable? Heck no!.  The story is flexible in a sense that it allows for various type of experimentation, in other words, you can have fun with it.  To describe the plot with minimal spoilers, it&#039;s a story about a boy learning to discover his inner erotic-self by teaming up with an erotic terrorist who is also the vice-president on the student council whose goal is to ban all erotic activities.  This is a story about their plans to free society from the grip of the extremes of morality laws that have become too misinformed about humanity&#039;s erotic nature.<br />
<br />
Art:  The art for Shimoneta is pretty standard, it&#039;s nothing too innovative or too surprising.  However, with that said, it is fundamentally sound and the character designs are unique, and erotic (if you can see it).<br />
<br />
Sound: S-O-X.  Enough said.  That is one awesome OP and ED.<br />
<br />
Character: The characters are the best part of this show for me.  Most of the main characters that are introduced grow and change in their own way throughout the show.  In fact, some characters change so drastically that it adds to the comedic elements of the show.  If there is one thing that makes this show stands out from the rest, it is the characters.  This show is 90% character driven.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:  If you are a fan of ero-comedy / do not take a show too seriously, Shimoneta is for you.  Sit back and enjoy the ride.  Don&#039;t think too much on it and just have a good laugh.  If you&#039;re looking for a deep plot, well you should probably keep looking but then go back and enjoy this show nonetheless.

    Shimoneta is a vastly underrated anime that, almost expectedly, gets poor reviews from the very types of people that it skewers. <br />
<br />
In 2015 we live in a society that is becoming increasingly intolerant to personal expression and freedom of speech and Shimoneta takes this trend and draws it to it&#039;s absurd and natural conclusion, demonstrating the oppressive nature of &quot;Political Correctness&quot; when it turns into censorship on moral grounds. The dystopian aspect of this show comes from the omnipresent police state that monitors and hence controls whatever it deems to be &quot;lewd behavior&quot;. Almost hysterically, hardly anyone, including the people enforcing these laws, actually know

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201918">
        what &quot;lewd behavior&quot; is - leading to a wide assortment of innocent or otherwise innocuous things (such as toilet paper!) being banned for being &quot;lewd&quot;.<br />
<br />
The entire premise is absurd, but it&#039;s meant to be that way in order to bring the points the show is trying to make into stark contrast. Constant themes are - Censorship by the state, repression of natural human urges, regression of human knowledge and art, loss of privacy, thought control and unjust laws. These are incredible themes for an anime, let alone a comedy anime, and Shimoneta tackles them all with aplomb (and tongue firmly in cheek).<br />
<br />
One of the biggest issues with this anime is that it relies heavily on cultural idioms, slang and puns because most of the humor is innuendo based. This doesn&#039;t translate well from Japanese to other languages, so your experience may vary depending on how much you understand these aspects of Japanese culture. That being said, there&#039;s still plenty of physical and situational comedy that most people should be able to understand.<br />
<br />
Shimoneta is a rare anime that challenges the viewer to not only come to grips with their own opinions about lewd or &quot;ecchi&quot; behavior and content, but also to think about how just or unjust it is to force your own views on other people.

    &quot;pornography<br />
      noun por·nog·ra·phy \-fē\<br />
: movies, pictures, magazines, etc., that show or describe naked people or sex in a very open and direct way in order to cause sexual excitement&quot;<br />
<br />
Now why the fuck would I give you a definition of &quot;pornography&quot; at the very beginning of this review? Just to warn you about the fucked up shits this anime may have. So ye, WATCH AT YOUR OWN RISK!<br />
<br />
Now that we have that stuff out of the way, let&#039;s start.<br />
<br />
HEY! Have you ever thought &quot;oh wow! Love To Ru&#039;s ecchi-ness would be great for a storyline that involves world were there is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208501">
        lack of dirty jokes as well as teenagers who rebel against the law and use them 24/7!&quot; ?<br />
Ye, neither did I. However, these guys at J.C. Staff (same guys that created Toradora!, Accel world, Karin, Zero no Tsukaima and more) thought that exact thing and created &quot;Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai&quot; or just Shimoneta.<br />
<br />
Now since this is a review, let&#039;s get into this.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
What? There is such a thing at &quot;story&quot; in this anime? Holy fuck how did I not notice it?<br />
<br />
Hold on.<br />
let me just- get some basic info about that...<br />
<br />
OK HERE WE GO<br />
A story about a boy who lives in a world which has forbidden the uses of dirt words or anything to do with explicit sexual contents. After he left to join the Tokioka Academy, on his very first day he met a girl called &quot;Blue snow&quot;, a girl with white panties on her face and nothing but white sheet over her body, who was known as the terrorist who broke all the laws just because she said some random dirty words in public (yeah I don&#039;t know either). Oh yeah, the boys name is Tanukichi Okuma, little mister innocent who joined the most cleanest school (seriously no one in that school knows about sex or how it works) just to follow the girl who was the only friend back then, known as Anna Nishikinomiya; the president of the Student Council and a daughter to her influential parents, whom are both responsible in enforcing the ever stricter public morality laws. (Did I mentioned he hated his father?) But of course, he got caught up in the action by meeting Ayame Kajou, a second year high school student at Tokioka Academy and also the Vice President of the school&#039;s student council, and eventually was forced to join her or else she would give him up to police (that poor fucker.) While the series go on, we are almost always greeted by the great and amazing narrator that honestly just annoyed me every time.<br />
<br />
Yeah, as you can see the &quot;story&quot; itself doesn&#039;t sound too appealing, except...it does. The fact that they live in a world where no one even knows basic things like what a fucking sex is sounds weird, yet interesting. It can be a very weird anime to follow, especially when the shit hits the fan in ep 4 but it is still a very unique and crazy as fuck anime.<br />
<br />
Visuals/sound track: <br />
This is something I am not so happy to talk about. The OST of this series has the mixture of &quot;yeah its cool&quot; and &quot;what the actual fuck is this?&quot; which, depending on your view, can mean that the OST is shit, ok, or good. The opening is something that got stuck in my brain, its weird; funny; catchy and just plain &quot;wtf&quot;? Which is a type of music I sometimes do listen to (yeah, judge all you want). The same can be said to the Ending, though I must say the ending was more catchy than opening. The rest of the sound track can at times.....just....plain. Nothing really amazing but also not something shit. It can be at times but compared to latest OSTs I&#039;ve listened to, this one was ok.<br />
<br />
The art however was something I should&#039;ve expected from the J.C. staff as (not always) their work has that &quot;flat&quot; look to it. The animation can be ok at times but sadly it just didn&#039;t make me go &quot;wow&quot; nor was it pleasant to my eyes. I was hoping to the animation that was as good as Toradora! but I guess I just wished for just a bit too much.<br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
The characters.....Do I really must talk about them? Only 5 out of 15 ( with only few of them appearing more than once) where interesting to say the least. Rest felt; flat; boring or just not given enough information about. One of them is Anna&#039;s mother who barely appeared on screen, and when she did she acted like that typical villain but without her actually being one. I guess for me, the most interesting character was Gouriki, since he literally looks like gay gorilla. <br />
<br />
I must say though, the designs of the characters are at least in a way &quot;original&quot;. I am using the term &quot;original&quot; lightly here because I am talking about their designs, not their personalities. <br />
<br />
Final verdict:<br />
<br />
All together Shimoneta is...an alright anime.<br />
It is a worth a watch anime, if you aren&#039;t disgusted by cringe worthy sexy jokes censored by the anime itself, so go ahead and watch it.<br />
I personally wouldn&#039;t watch it myself again<br />
So much so that I really cannot be asked to finish this review.<br />
This anime really is a good yet bad anime.<br />
It has an interesting concept and how it starts<br />
but as soon as I watched other episodes, I just felt all of it was lost.<br />
<br />
Personally, if you want to watch it, do it.<br />
But I will have to say this anime was...a failure.<br />
<br />

    Hello there. Do you love dirty jokes? I do, who doesn’t? I like my dirty jokes to go beyond the boundaries that many would consider to be the tipping point of how far jokes can go. There is an art to it that can make any of these jokes work when they are done with precision and finesse. Sometimes they are done with subtlety or not subtle in the slightest; both of which can be successful or a failure depending on how they are executed. Shimoneta fits the latter quite accurately to say the least. And when I say not subtle, that is taking it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203360">
        lightly.<br />
<br />
Set in a dystopian Tokyo where all shamelessness, lewdness, and dirty language has been outlawed, you can already assume ahead of time that Shimoneta is a satire of political correctness. More specifically, how the conservative government of Japan tries to censor any part of a medium that maybe considered morally indecent to the public in their own eyes. Shimoneta wants to portray how their utopia would become a reality and how it would not work based on how human biology works. In other words, humans are sexual creatures through and through, whether we all want to admit that truth or not. Not only that, but it can also be a satire of how sex education is important in our society and an abstinence only education would prove to be a flawed system.<br />
<br />
So does Shimoneta handle this satire well and make it hilarious in the long run? In short, it succeeds to make it into an entertaining anime with some subtle level of commentary to go by with it. Take, for instance, the character Anna, voiced by the recently passed Miyu Matsuki, who would be the archetype for a person who wants to be a pure person with no perverted characteristics. But because of an accidental kiss by the main character Tanukichi, that triggered a romantic spark into her brain that causes to develop urges that she never knew before. Shimoneta gives a pretty intelligent method of showing us the intricacies of how teenagers go through hormonal phases once they bloom into full-grown sexual young adulthood. It can also be enjoyed just as a silly joke and nothing else as well and Shimoneta obviously characterizes itself as either or just one alternative outlook.<br />
<br />
Another commentary that Shimoneta does exceptionally well is how they portray the dystopian society of conservative political correctness. It does not do it in such a way where it is done in a forceful manner that it becomes preachy as a result. Rather it keeps that theme in the background where it doesn’t seem too apparent for the viewer to be distracted by and doesn’t overshadow the comedy. Shimoneta wants to be a wacky sex comedy through and through with some added commentary mixed in, in order to make it unique from other anime ecchi shows. Even with a rape scene involving a woman licking a guy’s chest out of sexual gratification in a  non-consensual, it still manages to be hilarious and offer an intelligent insight that invertedly challenges our notion of how we can find things of this nature funny from a different set of circumstances. At least that is how I interpreted it.<br />
<br />
The comedy pulls so many punches to the viewer that it can be a bit much for the squeamish. But I love it when my ecchi anime pulls no limits to what it can do to either entertain or offend those who turn their nose up at shamelessness of this caliber. Simply put, Shimoneta is the most raunchy, lewd, indecent, and crazy ecchi anime I’ve ever come across, and probably you’ll ever come across. And I mean these with the utmost positive feelings that I could ever muster. Its clever ways of censoring dialogue to make us decipher what the characters are saying with some obvious hints based on context keeps its tone and comedic timing on-point and humorous from beginning to end. Many of its innuendos, whether it be visual or audible, might be forced in some cases but they help create a comedic atmosphere that keeps the show from being tedious and boring. Even some of the jokes that the writers came up took my breath away from how much they are willing to get away with. So much so that I think no other country except Japan would ever allow on television.<br />
<br />
Not only does the comedy work with the theme and atmosphere, but it also gives the characters some nice needed charm to make up for their lack of development. Truth be told, the characters are not the most three-dimensional. Most of them have the one characteristic that defines them as a character, whether it be wanting sweet love nectar, obsessed with drawing shameless pictures, or wanting to rid themselves of the purity police controlling people’s language and sex lives. Nevertheless, I found myself slightly forgiving this negative from how much I enjoyed the chemistry between our main hero Tanukichi and main heroine Ayame. Heck, almost all of the characters have wonderful chemistry between one another from the hilarious interactions and dialogues that are clever and done with great comedic timing. One other character worth mentioning is the art prodigy Otome who’s brash and crazy attitude adds so much to the cast thanks to the always hilarious Satomi Arai doing her Kuroko voice from A Certain Scientific Railgun.<br />
<br />
I found myself enjoying the creative art designs of the characters from how colorful and expressive they exhibit. There are some areas where I think the art can be a bit too bright and white-washed in some scenes. Overall, technically Shimoneta is a nicely animated show with many comedic gags having a great sense of depth and absurdity despite the fact that it is censored, in an ironic fashion. I would not necessarily call the music a highlight of the show, even though I found myself enjoying the ED with its combination of jazz-influenced horns and J-Pop vocals. The music from the show itself is not very special in the slightest and I found myself not paying much attention to it while watching.<br />
<br />
It is hard for me to reminisce about this show without some fascination about it. I found myself intrigued with the possibility of ecchi anime like Shimoneta existing more often, if this ever becomes a big hit in the future, after watching it. Not just in how balls to the wall it is with its subject matter and jokes, but how it can offer a witty way of implementing a theme that is synonymous with sexual aspects of real life. Ecchi, of course, is here to give us some sexual gratification to hone our skills of being lewd in real life. It feels welcoming to see an anime like Shimoneta to prove that it can be more than that in more ways than one.<br />
<br />
Grade: A-<br />

    &quot;One thing about terrorists... Even if we know we&#039;re going to fail, we must still tell dirty jokes!&quot; - Ayame Kajou<br />
<br />
(Ironic note: my 69th review.)<br />
<br />
Finally, a self parodying ecchi anime! Why can&#039;t there be more of these out there? If the title didn&#039;t cue you in, this show is about the most middle school topic you can think of: cheesy sex jokes. The premise is that Japan&#039;s government is just a shadow government, taken over 16 years prior run by a bunch of overbearing prudes who seek to stamp out every trace of sexuality and obscenity from society. This group of children who were born

          <span style="display: none;" id="review198934">
        and raised in the culture since the transition have grown up in a world where the Concept of a Dirty Joke Doesn&#039;t Exist- and SOX, a &quot;dirty&quot; terror organization, rises to the occasion, to spread the good word of the filth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Artwork and Animation: 7<br />
<br />
For a show about terrible sex jokes, a large portion of the show is visual gags- and boy do they drop the visual gags in this show. While it&#039;d be impossible to list them all, let it suffice to say that one character is shaped like a dong, and approximately 75% of the backgrounds/scenes and items in every episode consist of innuendo or something outright sexual. <br />
<br />
Animation wise, very solid in fluidity and consistent detail level. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound and Voice Acting: 7<br />
<br />
I have to hand it to Miyu Matsuki. She really knocked it out of the park as the painfully ignorant of sexuality, but lustful to a violent degree Anna. You can feel the crazy vibes from here, and I&#039;m 7000 miles away. <br />
Also major props to Yuusuke Kobayashi- a relative unknown VA in a sea of ladies voicing male characters- playing Okuma. Just the right amount of indignity and protesting to turn Okuma into a sympathetic hero, I mean terrorist. <br />
The opening and outro songs were written for the show, they&#039;re okay, but I ended up skipping them after about three epsiodes. Not really anything I&#039;d ever want to hear again. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
<br />
They say the joke is all about the delivery- and in a comedy show, you have to have a varied cast of weirdos to make the humor work. Thankfully, we&#039;re provided a relatable, spunky, hyperactive heroine in the form of Ayame Kajou. Ayame performs her duties as Student Council VP during the day, valiantly upholding the rigid morality standards of the school while moonlighting as the dirty terrorist known as Blue Snow.<br />
She has a penchant for the most middle school-esque humor of any character I&#039;ve ever seen, real or animated. She turns literally everything into some really lame, really bad sex pun- just like I did when I was 12, and I loved it. It&#039;s not that her character is particularly funny (unless you actually are in middle school), it&#039;s more that I was reminded of those days, and how incredibly edgy sexual humor was back then, compared to its relative commonplace status now, as an adult. <br />
<br />
My personal favorite character was probably the feisty shorty Saotome, however. As an impossibly talented artist, she joins SOX as the propaganda chairperson- in charge of creating and distributing lewd materials, which due to constant surveillance by the arm bands and necklaces that everyone is required to wear, became quite difficult, since any lewd drawings done with her hands would get her arrested. So she learns to draw using her mouth, and pops out the most salacious, freaky doujinshi ever created- mostly starring her classmates. She drops some of the best one liners in the show. <br />
<br />
I can imagine most viewers of the show would likely pick Anna as the overall best thing in the show- but I disagree. I found her presence more irritating than entertaining. She serves almost entirely to be a plot device whenever Ayame and Okuma run into trouble simply because she&#039;s obsessed with Okuma and follows him around, trying to gift him her &quot;love nectar&quot;. When she gets into these lustful moods (because she has no concept of love vs lust), she gains superhuman strength and agility- which is usually put to use &quot;cleansing immoral activities&quot; that the ever pious Kajo and Okuma point her towards. Honestly, if you were to remove Anna and all mention of her from the plot and replace her with any other girl for Okuma to crush on, the show wouldn&#039;t have suffered in the slightest. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 6 <br />
<br />
As stated above, this near future Japan has instated constant surveillance on the youth of the nation, and any type of publicly lewd act, lewd drawings, objects, speech, or otherwise &quot;immoral&quot; behavior is punishable by law. After government raids eradicated the vast majority of porno, dirty magazines, toys, and other sexually related paraphernalia, that which remains is a hidden treasure- one that some, seen as &quot;Dirty Terrorists&quot; would seek to use to educate the wider populace and turn public opinion towards sexuality into a more favorable one. This is where SOX comes in. An organization (hardly) consisting initially of solely Ayame Kajo performing petty acts such as public indecency and distribution of lewd materials, it transforms into a serious threat through the course of the show, with discoveries and creation of new dirty materials and education of the irrationally ignorant student populace. <br />
<br />
As it would happen though, SOX is not the only terrorist group whose activities are purely of the sexual nature. Fetishists, and other weirdo characters crop up to try and steal their sexual thunder, but there can be only one. <br />
<br />
The story strokes off strongly at first, but is plagued by a really weak and boring middle. Episodes 7, 8, and 9 are practically filler as they&#039;re just setups for the endgame, and episode 5 is just a fetch quest episode. The climax is decent, but as with many anime... the big bad is just a stepping stone to a bigger bad, and with a &quot;twist&quot; that everyone saw coming, the effect is pretty weak. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and Overall: 7 <br />
<br />
The show is absolutely chock full of sophomoric humor, but at the same time, it&#039;s rather charming in the delivery. If there was ever an anime that took me back to being in middle school, this was it. I hearkened back to days in public middle school, discovering new combinations of bad words and trying them out on unsuspecting prudes to my endless entertainment. The show definitely has some creatively funny moments, and some lowbrow, tasteless ones too. Only with this kind of show, it at least knows it&#039;s crude, takes the balls and fondles them. I mean, runs with it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Recommend?<br />
<br />
If you want a refresher on the seemingly endless stream of ecchi garbage that constitutes the majority of anime in 2015, this one would be a good choice.

This show isnt for everyone, it requires an open mind and heart. Let me tel you all why. Basically this show is one of that anime series that you cant watch with your family unless they are really open minded because the jokes are dirty and thats what the anime want to show. <br />
<br />
The story starts with a boy (Okuma) who finally is aproved to a great school, but the problem is the school is one of the most rigid when it comes about morals. The context of the plot is that in Japan is prohibited to use dirty

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201082">
        words like p*nis, v*gina, and etc. Students even dont know how sex is made and how people have babies. <br />
<br />
So a terrorist called Setsugen no Ao appears with a pantsu on her head and trow pictures of nudity in the street. I&#039;m not gonna tell the story here because if you want to know you need to watch it.<br />
<br />
The art is great, its very similar to the novel, the characters are so funny, speciially Setsugen no Ao. Theres a girl with a hair like a p*nis head, a scientist student that have no emotions and keep following the protagonist asking him how babies are made, Anna whos the president of the moral concil on the school the protagonist just arrived, and later on reveals herself a &quot;crazy&quot; person.<br />
<br />
The sound is 10, outstanding because the songs are funny just like the anime and the seyus are great. Setsugen no Ao is voiced by the ones who was the voice for Shiodome Akira from Naga no Asukara and Okuma was voiced by the same man who made the protagonist from Witch craft works, both great animes.<br />
 <br />
This show is a masterpiece for those who wants to just see dirty jokes and funny characters. This isnt for that moments when you want some deep plot about time travel like Steins;gate, or a complex world context like Shinsekai yori. This anime series is SIMPLE but that what makes it so great.<br />
For the reviews above, you should watch at least more than 200 anime series to tell something. Watching Naruto, One Piece, Bleach only doesnt give you the rights to deeply analyze animes like this.<br />
<br />
If you are searching for a great with dirty conversations anime series THIS IS THE MASTERPIECE show you are looking for.<br />
<br />
<br />
A WORLD WITHOUT DIRTY JOKES IS BORING!!!<br />
<br />
SETSUGEN NO AO, AISHITEIRU!!!!

    Shinometa came to me with an interesting synopsis &quot;a world where everything obscene or perverted is prohibited and a group of sex-called terrorists SOX go around town doing perverted acts&quot; well let&#039;s give it a good opotunidady was a great decision Shinometa was anime that I liked most this season,<br />
<br />
For me this anime implemented a new way of seeing animes ecchis where censorship is put on purpose, amuses you.<br />
<br />
Characters great strength of anime, Ayame Kajou was my favorite character every time he said over indecency to literally shit laughing.<br />
<br />
Well I hope you have a second season but I hope there are rumors confirmed, would give

    BHAHAHAHAHA, what did I just finish watching?<br />
I can&#039;t believe someone had thought of an anime like this!<br />
<br />
Short Summary:<br />
Japan now has a law against everything and anything considered indecent; magazines, games. Literally CONSIDERED indecent, you name it. However due to this it created terrorists groups that go against these laws. One of these groups called SOX is a terrorist group that tries to reeducate the citizens again in the ways of eros.<br />
<br />
First of all, this plot is insane!<br />
I mean what?? Law against everything considered indecent?? What even man!<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t stop there. The anime itself has some pretty insane scenes and A LOT of dirty jokes that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200869">
        are censored for many reasons.<br />
It&#039;s amazing this series was able to pass as a proper anime series, not that I&#039;m against it but damn! <br />
The scenes in the series are super indecent at times...<br />
<br />
I guess there is a specific story line but as you can guess it&#039;s mainly about the comedy in this anime which literally made me laugh out loud! <br />
The ending left me speechless... I actually really don&#039;t know what to say about it....<br />
<br />
Did I enjoy this series?<br />
OF COURSE I DID! This was that ONE anime series that you would watch for the humor!<br />
And I would totally recommend it but you would need one heck of a dirty mind to understand ALL of the jokes cause for sure I only got a few jokes.<br />

    Oh boy, hold on to your underpants for this one... Shimoneta literally means dirty joke, and you&#039;ll get more than both ears worth in this show. Whereas Seitokai Yakuindomo had a lot of implied dirty jokes, Shimonata literally doesn&#039;t hold any punches. Though I&#039;m still not quite sure how this got on TV, expect everything in the ecchi drawing book from panties and upskirts galore to what can only be described as soft core porn with many smiley stickers on the screen.<br />
<br />
The show is about, ironically, an idealized Japan where everything lewd is purged Fahrenheit 451 style; and where everyone is forced to wear bracelets

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202470">
        tracked by Big Brother. In this world, we find a girl &quot;terrorist&quot; who spreads lewd pictures and wears a panty on her head as a mask in the name of celebrating sexuality. Into this comes our protagonist, the son of an erotic terrorist who wants nothing more than to go to school with his idealized figure of purity, Anna. While trying to save another student from being falsely accused of molestation, Tanukichi is targeted by the accuser and saved from the police -er... morality officers- by none other than the girl terrorist. How will this fateful encounter ripple through this innocent Japan? Be warned, this show is not for the faint of heart- proceed only if shows like High School DxD or ImoCho do not faze you.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
The show is drawn in a bright color palette with average backgrounds and lighting. The funding seems focused on the ridiculous variety of ecchi in the show. From indecent postcards to sparkling &quot;love juice&quot;, expect all sorts of soft core attempts to awaken a dude&#039;s walrus (they apparently chose that instead of the more typical elephant). In any case, expect this to be one of the most outrageously in-your-face ecchi shows out there. As for character styling, everyone is... unique I guess? All I can say is, not everyone is as pure as they initially seem...<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The puns and dirty jokes continue even into the OP and EDs (some of which &quot;educate&quot; the viewer into how to make a &quot;pleasant&quot; mold among other things). The OP has an unnecessarily long introduction before launching into a rather old-sounding song, though it&#039;s clearly designed for the show. Annoyingly, the main theme is catchy- just make sure no one catches you humming to it in public. The funky ED, if anything, is even more catchy and fitting for the show; note that the lyrics are pretty NSFW. The BGM has many brass instruments, fitting for the ecchi-based theme. However, more noticeable is the virtually endless visual and auditory censoring.<br />
<br />
As for VAs, you have a mix between veterans and relative new actors. On the veteran&#039;s side, you have the instantly-recognizable voice of Satomi Arai, and, amazingly, Yui Horie voicing a young brat, whose hair takes the form of a certain mushroom shape when she get&#039;s &quot;energized&quot;. Oh, and if you feel a need to control your bulge when listening to Anna, don&#039;t forget that you&#039;re listening to the aroused groans of a 38-year-old veteran. Overall, expect a fair performance with a ridiculous amount of screaming and censoring.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
As alluded to earlier, the show is about a terrorist organization called &quot;SOX&quot; and its efforts to spread dirty jokes and, to a more benign degree, sexual education to the general populace. The show successfully pokes fun of the glaring problems when there is no sexual education for children, while also ignoring the ridiculous improbability of such a world existing in the first place.<br />
<br />
The show follows a central plotline with a well established pattern of introducing supporting characters before launching into a few arcs each with a small climax, not counting those in your pants. There aren&#039;t very many plot twists, and the few that are present are given huge amounts of foreshadowing so that seasoned viewers should be able to pretty much guess their way through the entire show.<br />
<br />
The mood of the show is, for the most part, very light and filled with (as the title implies) dirty jokes and ecchi. The actual plot is rather mild in intensity, and doesn&#039;t really make very much progress. The core of this show is the dirty jokes, and if that&#039;s not what you&#039;re here for you&#039;re better off looking elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
I ought to echo what I just said above, but for the sake of entertainment, I won&#039;t. The characters in this show are not that great, they have barely any exposition and really are all just sexually-curious teenagers, regardless of whether or not they actually state so. I guess both Tanukichi and Anna are dynamic characters, though Anna sort of feels like she&#039;s taken directly from a hentai at times. Don&#039;t expect much from this category, unless your goal is to see characters in outrageous outfits and circumstances.<br />
<br />
Value:<br />
Though dirty jokes can be a fair tool at appropriate times, this show takes it far, far beyond that. The show with supposedly the highest moral-based setting is ironically one of the most lecherous, non-hentai works out there. Though unique in its approach, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if many people shun its parody; similar to how one could shun 30sai. This show is for those who appreciate ecchi, and can handle it in large quantities. For everyone else, may your eyes find more peaceful sights elsewhere.

    Shimoneta is Summer 2015&#039;s most prominent ecchi comedy series and has finally concluded its first season. It is very difficult to write an objective review of something as subjective as an ecchi comedy but in the case of Shimoneta it has an advantage that others do not; It has absolutely no plot.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s begin; It&#039;s a sex-comedy show established as being about a group of Naughty Terrorists that want to spread sex education in a world that suppresses all sexuality similar to what feminism wants to do in the real world but I digress. A totalitarian government exists and does not let people draw or say

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199026">
        things that could be construed as lewd, because of this, people are wildly ignorant about sex and that&#039;s where SOX comes in.<br />
<br />
The show is episodic (somewhat) and is about missions undertaken by the members of SOX, it sounds a lot more exciting than it actually is... it is , in reality, a basic framework and backdrop for the real meat and potatoes which is, telling as many dirty jokes as possible. In this reviewer&#039;s humble opinion, they don&#039;t work, they&#039;re forced and are unfunny. <br />
<br />
The two main characters are Kajou Akame (Female lead) and Tanukichi Okuma (Male lead), both are serviceable , if a bit boring... but their actions do have a lot of energy and when they interact it can lead to funny situations. That being said, the situations are often hit-or-miss, mostly miss. But what I can tell you about a comedy anime other than, I didn&#039;t find it funny? well, the leads are average at best and most of the supporting cast is weak but.... it has two characters in it which absolutely stole the show.<br />
<br />
That is, Anna Nikishinomiya and Fuwa Hyouka. <br />
Telling you about these characters would be a disservice to them , partially spoiling their charm, but let me tell you that the creators of this show knew that the leads were a bit dull and threw in these two to fill in the quota of comedy, it works, at least for me. <br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly this is the worst review I have written. There is no story, there is no character development, there is very little in the form of artwork other than the basics so I can&#039;t critique it as I would a normal show. All I can tell you is, I would have rated this *VERY* low if not for those two members of the supporting cast I mentioned. They are unique, they are new, they are interesting, the things they do are so mind-jarringly strange that it is truly a treat when they show up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are looking for sex, this show has none, no actual sex ever takes place.<br />
If you are looking for fast-paced, sexually suggestive comedy, this will have it.<br />
If you are looking for an intricate plot and character development, this does NOT have it.<br />
If you are looking for a diverse, unique, interesting cast of characters, this does NOT have it.<br />
If you want to see a woman trick a man into eating cookies made with her love juice, this is the show for you.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed it, it only just barely.

    So the first few times I saw this anime in the form of a few screenshots with jokes on a humour site I frequent I said to myself &quot;This is stupid, this is exactly the reason people call anime watchers weebs...&quot; and ignored it. But boy I was so wrong.<br />
This is a piece of art when it comes to comedy. I truly am unable to remember when I laughed so much while watching an anime or a TV series.<br />
Anyway now let&#039;s break it down in categories.<br />
<br />
-Story: 8-<br />
The story of this is well...just good. The action takes part 16 years after almost any trace of pornography

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206409">
        is destroyed and it became illegal to use any bad words. In schools kids were taught to be totally sexually oblivious until Blue Snow , a female terrorist destroys the peace.<br />
<br />
-Art: 10-<br />
I&#039;m not exactly an artist so I can just say the art is extremely good, just like in most animes in the last 2 years.<br />
<br />
-Sound: 10-<br />
The sound fx in this anime is worth more than 10.It is hilariously good. From the theme songs that are just as funny as the jokes in the anime to the verbal puns that make you die of laughter.<br />
<br />
-Character: 9-<br />
Well all the characters seem pretty well designed and all add to the hilarity either with their obliviousness to sexual matters or their exaggerated passion for them.<br />
<br />
-Enjoyment: 9-<br />
I can say that I really loved it and I am thankful I watched it.<br />
<br />
-Overall: 9-<br />
As long as you look at it from a strictly comedic point of view you can say this truly deserves its score.

    &quot;Pornography does not create perversions, it merely arouses a pervert&#039;s imagination.&quot; <br />
<br />
   Shimoneta is the kind of anime that not everyone will like or enjoy by any means (obviously) as it is.. well.. crude as hell. It is intended for people who like shameless sexual humor, and that is it&#039;s target audience. Now my reason for giving it the score that I did is based mostly on my enjoyment of the series and it&#039;s over the top nature rather than it&#039;s plot and characters which are pretty average as far as anime goes. Now lets get into the meaty details.<br />
<br />
   Story:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201803">
        6 - This is a series that by no means should be taken seriously. It is not the kind of anime that you go into for a complex or compelling narrative. Now, I think that the scenario given to us is better than most others in that it takes place in an alternate Japan where anything deemed &quot;immoral&quot; by it&#039;s government was banned and deemed illegal. This is possibly commentary on how Japan already censor&#039;s much of it&#039;s sexual content already, except here taken to the extreme obviously.<br />
   The main plot revolves around a male student attending a new high-school (like we haven&#039;t seen this before) before he gets himself wrapped up in a terrorist organization run by another high-school student who goes by the code-name &quot;Blue Snow&quot; whose plan is to rid japan of the oppressive censorship and to return everything to as it once was. <br />
  Pretty standard stuff really, although don&#039;t expect a lot of plot progression or deep twists here, really the bulk of the show lies in it&#039;s gags and situational humor.<br />
<br />
  Art: 8 - Nothing to say as far as art goes, it stays pretty consistent and I never really found myself groaning at any flaws as far as character design or animation goes. <br />
<br />
  Sound: 7 - Same goes for sound. I like both the intro and the outro themes very much, and everything else as far as sound design goes is pretty run of the mill and nothing special. <br />
<br />
  Character: 6 - Unfortunately as far as characters go in Shimoneta, they&#039;re as you expect for this kind of genre. Most of the side characters have really only one personality trait and are very one-dimensional. Now by no means do I  expect incredibly deep and compelling characters in an anime where the main gag is about f*cking, but I at least want something a little bit better than what we keep getting is all. Not all characters are like this fortunately, as I found  Ayame (Blue Snow) pretty enjoyable as well as a few others I can&#039;t mention because spoilers. I don&#039;t HATE what was done here, but I do want to see a bit more personality out of more of the cast rather than just the few that do.<br />
<br />
  Enjoyment: 7 - I have to admit, I really enjoyed watching this. Even with all of it&#039;s flaws I still found myself wanting to watch the next episode just to see what ridiculous sh*t would happen next. The jokes aren&#039;t anything smart or intelligent by any means, and I&#039;m ok with that. Shimoneta is something that you turn your brain off and just enjoy, nothing more and nothing less than mindless entertainment in my opinion. <br />
<br />
  Overall: 7/10 - As I said before, this isn&#039;t for everyone. If you are a fan of over the top crude adult humor than this is the anime for you. But for everyone else, I say give it a shot...  but don&#039;t go in with high expectations.<br />
<br />

    Lately censorship has become completely unreasonable and an anime tackling this problem sounded promising, but oh how wrong it all went.<br />
<br />
Lets start with the story.The anime takes place sometime in the future when Japan has banned all things “immoral”. Our main character Tanukichi Okuma has just transferred to the elite public morals school where he is quickly summoned to join the student council to help fight the terrorist organisation SOX that is fighting against censorship, but he almost immediately gets blackmailed by one of the council members Ayame Kajou, who is actually one of the terrorists, to join the terrorists and commit obscene acts.<br />
<br />
Well the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202656">
        whole concept is not all that bad and could be made perfectly enjoyable, however the sheer amount of unnecessary profanity made the whole thing barely watchable. First off why should every other sentence spoken in the show reference either sex, masturbation or intimate body parts, that might be funny the first few times but after less than ten minutes it started to get old and after the first episode it was just painful. Most of the episodes were abysmal, but the surprising thing is that the ending was quite enjoyable and the anime ended on a positive note so I couldn’t give it an even lower score.<br />
<br />
Sometimes a bad story can be offset by great characters, but that sure as hell does not apply here. Our main character is one of the blandest out there, he manages to have no defining traits, we know next to nothing about his backstory and even his actions are dictated by someone else most of the time. Are the others any better? Well they are, but they are still poorly developed and completely one dimensional. The members of SOX can’t even speak normally without obnoxious sexual references. The one character who shines is Fuwa, as she manages to be the only one who is not overly annoying with her jokes and is one of the only reasons I managed to sit through this travesty, but unfortunately her screen time is limited. The relationships between characters are as poorly developed as the characters. One relationship stands out the most and that is the one between Okuma and his crush, the student council president Ana. The scenes between these two made me want to puke at times, it was just so wrong and disgusting.<br />
<br />
The animation was nothing to write home about, but it still managed to work well enough. Here I want to touch the absolutely retarded way of censoring in the “uncensored” version with stickers that looked like the body part it was covering. I have no idea who thought that it would be fun, but it just came out as immature as the rest of the series. Still that does not mean there was no fan-service as it was plentiful and completely tasteless, why would one want to constantly see bodily fluids of our characters. The soundtrack itself was not bad, but the opening was just awful, the ending was not much better so neither made their way into my iTunes library.<br />
<br />
All in all watching this has been quite the ordeal and it was probably the worse anime I have ever seen, and if it wasn’t for the last few episodes this would have surely gotten a score lower than 3, but considering the ending was not even bad it just manages to scrape up a score of 5 out of 10. Do I recommend this to anyone? To be frank no, I do not think it is worth your time as there are so many better shows out there. In the end it was sad that I found an anime that fights against censorship, to be one of the best examples why some form of censorship is sometimes needed.<br />

    <br />
Shimoneta and I have a love hate relationship. <br />
<br />
Story.<br />
<br />
The premise that porno-terrorists survive in a post-porn Japan is a fun one. Picturing groups of young ones running around re-educating the Japanese in the ways of the pervent makes me chuckle inside. <br />
<br />
The problem is that this greater story is rarely touched up. Many of the 12 episodes are based on recruitment. Others are on interpersonal relationships, but other than a passing mention, the plot at large goes both unexplored and unremembered, as well as unresolved.<br />
<br />
This is an anime with great artwork that -could- have been much much more. There is some obvious creative thought that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220148">
        went into some of the cast of characters, but oddly enough, it&#039;s the main two protagonists (if you can call a terrorist a protagonist), that are the least fleshed out. Both are bland and uninspired, in contrast to the rest of the crew.<br />
<br />
Character development and identity exist though, in splotches. The characters that were thought out are great. Almost every scene with Fuwa, a creepy scientist on the verge of understanding reproduction between humans,  is hilarious. Gouriki, a large man who doesn&#039;t know he&#039;s gay because the term doesn&#039;t exist anymore, is funny to watch. Anna has great lines and colors, hilarious action, and a strong if sudden change of heart that changes the theme of the show.<br />
<br />
As a comedy, it works. Anything else is beyond the show, which is greater than the sum of it&#039;s parts. <br />

    A very silly anime, but in a good way<br />
<br />
Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai, is not the type of anime you&#039;d want your family walking in on you watching.<br />
<br />
Very light hearted,  non serious, comedic show that is tailored towards a mature audience.<br />
<br />
This anime presents a hilarious theme, that doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously, shimoneta knows that it is ridiculous, but that&#039;s why I enjoyed so much. <br />
If you expect a serious story driven anime, then this is not for you, it is more the type you would watch when you need a really good laugh, and it delivers in that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203786">
        regard.<br />
It is set in a overly censored Japan, with rebellion being a strong theme, most of the show is set in a high school <br />
<br />
The art is really good and enjoyable, it comes with a stylised way that doesn&#039;t deviate from the more mainstream anime styles. Shimoneta had quite the charming look throughout the whole thing, it was done tastefully even the more sexualised parts.<br />
The censorship Shimoneta was hilarious, with some ecchi scenes it does a good job of letting you fill in the blanks and making for a very funny experience.<br />
It has so much material which is perfect for making into reaction pictures and gifs which can be all credited to the wonderful job done by the staff.<br />
<br />
The cast of characters in Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai was almost perfect, The anxious teen Tanukichi, The suggestive rebel Kajou, Anna The prefect who will do anything as long as it is righteous, Saotome the talented artist and Kosuri the childish and devilish young girl.<br />
These characters are who got the most screen time and for good reason with them all bringing their own quirks to the table, as a whole every character was unique and crazy.<br />
<br />
As for the sound, all the characters had very fitting voices that were suited towards their personalities very well, the delivery of dialogue throughout was great and especially Ayame Kajou whose innuendoes were well placed/so random you dont even know how to react.<br />
the effects were suited to each action, even some to the point of being cartoony but that isn&#039;t a bad thing.<br />
<br />
I thoroughly enjoyed Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai, I found it refreshing and funny to the point where I had to pause the episode until I chilled out.<br />
<br />
I would recommend this anime to anyone who likes short but sweet shows that wont take up too much time or brain power to watch.<br />
<br />
A very solid 8/10.
