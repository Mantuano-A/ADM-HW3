    I will make this quick, this is either a series you will love or you will hate.<br />
<br />
The primary reason to hate it is cause of the animation which is a heavy use of cgi animation and not of the best quality or because the main lead is annoying little brat with a hero complex and it makes you want to just drop it right there.<br />
<br />
Well if u ignore those two i think you might actually like this series, the story is simple, It focuses on the entire town of Shibuya being teleport-ed along with the population within it to a different time in the future

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298632">
        and they struggle to survive in a different time period when the world is nothing but  dystopia controlled by a group known as the revisions who seek to control the world and turn every last living being into like them a revison. The group focuses primarily on 5 students who have a connection to the events that occurred using mech suits knows as puppet strings to fight the enemy and try to get back to there own time.<br />
<br />
That is pretty much the series, it is a sci-fi fantasy mech show with a simple plot but nevertheless intriguing story, nothing original but something to watch if u have nothing else to do. it has a bit of comedic moments, some serious moments and plenty of action to satisfy you.<br />
<br />
Like i said if u can get past the animation quality and the annoying main lead you can have a fun watch. Give it a try and you decide.

    How to describe Revisions?<br />
The MC personality is can be described as the simple &quot;Hero complex&quot;. The trope is done quite frequently, commonly displayed in an antagonist, that which impedes the protagonist&#039;s progress through their own journey for their own ambitions. The twist with making the main character having this personality instead is interesting, but it cannot be called quality. A change in writing norm does not mean all originality is well written, rather, it indicates that the writer strives for something different. Whether it is good or bad is always subjective. But this is not. Through reading the opinions of others, I can gather that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298695">
        people legitimately enjoyed this anime, but their reviews were a basic defence against the universal panning it is receiving online and lacked depth in the explanations in coming to the defence of this anime. These reviews have generally been stating their view on the protagonist as &quot;Good and original&quot;. While stating your opinion is always welcome and you shouldn&#039;t be discouraged to share your review, these interpretations I read felt as though they were &quot;reaching&quot; for some deeper meaning and got lost while binging this anime the first day it came out. But I digress, this review will cover the entirety of the anime and hopefully shed some light on the tragedy of writing that is &quot;Revisions&quot;. If you want to know if you should watch it, just skip to the end.<br />
<br />
<br />
*Note: Prior to some review sections, I like to quote the characters from the series I&#039;m reviewing. No, these quotes aren&#039;t chosen arbitrarily and generally relate to my point. Just brace yourself for formal and informal writing forms.<br />
Story 3/10<br />
<br />
&quot;This doesn&#039;t feel real, I guess we just have to accept it now&quot;<br />
<br />
The story is atrocious. Simplicity is a trait generally frowned upon in writing, though there is nothing wrong with a simple story, the execution is ultimately the deciding factor in whether a story has a good &quot;hook&quot; and if it possesses the ability to keep the audience attached to this hook. The character of Milo implants the idea of pre-determined fate into Daisuke&#039;s mind, which in turn creates the dangerous &quot;Hero complex&quot; displayed in the present timeframe shown in the series. When a disaster comes, Daisuke takes this chance to prove that he is a hero. The problem with this is the occurrences that happen after. Everything just seems to fall into place for no real reason. An officer just believes that Milo is from the future and everyone agrees to the children piloting the mechs called<br />
&quot;String Puppets&quot;. At one point, I saw a glimmer of hope in the character of Mayor Muta. A character who I assumed was attempting to take advantage of the situation to increase his status and control in the area, which would explain why he would be so complicit with Milo&#039;s plans. This was quickly thrown out the window and he is shown to be spineless and doesn&#039;t contribute to the story, mainly because he gets taken out of the story completely until the near the end.<br />
<br />
*This paragraph mainly just points out all the questions that come because of the terrible writing in the show. You can just skip it if you like.<br />
The design of the story always brings up questions with terrible explanations. The main characters ask Milo why String Puppets can only be piloted by them, the children, to which Milo responds &quot;That&#039;s how they were designed&quot;. This is never touched upon again. Also, when Lu and Gai, two of Daisuke&#039;s friends, obtain their own String Puppets, they seemingly master them and defeat a revision even though they just entered their mechs moments before. When Milo tells Lu to adjust the aim of her sniper 2.4 degrees to the right, Lu complies as though she isn&#039;t a high schooler who just entered a mech for the first time and is wielding a massive sniper, but some trained mech pilot. Mayor Muta agrees to work with the revisions stating that Milo is a person from the future with no evidence that they should believe her, but the representative from the revision also presents no evidence so they just jumped ship from one to the other with no real reason. In the start of a single episode, the people of Shibuya power the whole city, find an abundance of food and water and restore infrastructure to its previous state just because it&#039;s convenient to the plot. In an attempt to fix this in a single line, the police chief states that they are running out of food and water out of the blue when arguing with his subordinates. This wasn&#039;t a question, it&#039;s just bad writing.<br />
<br />
Remember how I mentioned that there is nothing wrong with a simple story? Well, the writers then thought that they could create a complex story through the use of the &quot;Time Travel&quot; plot device. Time travel in fiction is always difficult, as its use in stories is always hard to nail. This is because the concept of time travel is complicated. If a character travels to the past to change the future, why would they need to predict that there is a possible outcome where the future is saved. That should be a given. If a character travels back in time to fulfil a created paradox, then should they not have needed to fulfil the paradox if their future is saved? Time travel from a writer&#039;s perspective can often create more questions and plot holes than serve to enhance the story&#039;s depth. <br />
<br />
The comedy in the show is bad and feels forced. It feels as though the director asked a writer &quot;Could you please write up some jokes, it doesn&#039;t have to pertain to the plot.&quot; There isn&#039;t much else I can say about it besides that it doesn&#039;t belong in this series. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I am amazing! Now, I can protect everyone!&quot;<br />
<br />
Character 3/10<br />
<br />
The characters start by being relatable. The main characters are average people. Unfortunately, they are all very forgettable. Daisuke at the start of the series is somewhat relatable, in the sense that he strives for something more in his life. An inner turmoil or struggle with oneself that many in their teens or later adulthood experience. While this is an interesting concept, I mentioned that the execution of a story is a deciding factor in whether or not something can be called &quot;good&quot;. This is the same when creating a character and their story. Daisuke&#039;s personality is shown to be dangerous, almost borderline psychopathic in nature. He is developed as a character who is mad with power. There was one scene where one of his friends questioned his assumed authority and Daisuke nearly attacked them with his mech. I realize that I&#039;m repeating myself, but the way the characters are developed is executed poorly. Rather than developing a character, the writers intended to flesh out a personality trait. Is it interesting to have a protagonist with realistic flaws? Yes, but it&#039;s not sustainable in a storyline if the protagonist doesn&#039;t change in some way to reflect on their flaws and it isn&#039;t interesting is the protagonist is based on a personality type with only flaws. That is the main reason the desired &quot;Hero complex&quot; works with the antagonist, as their flaws are what lead them to work against the protagonist. <br />
<br />
Daisuke&#039;s uncle Mikio was one of the only people that stood out to me and he only showed up briefly. It was because he was close to Daisuke and was shown to be a voice of reason. While most other characters would ridicule Daisuke for his ambitions and actions, Mikio tried to explain why his rash actions should be reflected upon. Later, Mikio, along with the rest of the Shibuya citizens, just give into Daisuke&#039;s delusions of being a hero. He continues to try and be a voice of reason but to a lesser effect later in the series.<br />
<br />
There is a point where an AI in Daisuke&#039;s String Puppet calls him out for being a deluded coward, which I thought would be a turning point in his character development. He turns out to just forget about it in the next episode.<br />
<br />
Art 4/10<br />
<br />
I understand that CG is offputting to some, but I find that some animes that use CG often utilize it to the best of its ability. This series did not. You may find yourself confused at the fact that the studio animated the scenes of Daisuke and his friends as children normally, and then switched to CG animation in the present time. Some research was done into this and an animator explained the reasoning behind this was because they had no character models for the younger children. Since they were only shown in flashbacks in a couple of scenes, it was easier to animate a scene rather than create a new character model for all five of the main characters. In theory, it&#039;s a logical approach to an animator and I would agree with them if I wasn&#039;t the person watching the anime. I have to admit this as a reviewer, the 2-D animations for the scenes with Daisuke and his friends as children were fantastic. The art style, the environment design, the facial expressions elicited by these characters. I found myself enjoying these scenes greatly, as they showed the quality animation that can be achieved with a high budget and proper execution. And then the series takes that away to give you CG animation that is poorly done.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start off with the lip-syncing done in the series. It is borderline abridged series level. If you&#039;ve never seen an abridged series, they tend to flap a character&#039;s lips to match the dialogue. The problem with this is that, although you don&#039;t need to spend time emoting expression in the dialogue, there is a disconnect with what the person is saying at times. No, this isn&#039;t done in every scene, but it&#039;s done enough times to which it is noticeable to an average viewer. The combat is standard. When I say this, I mean this in the most literal way possible. It&#039;s not bad, but there is absolutely nothing that set&#039;s it apart from everything else. The planning for scenes was bad. It&#039;s evident even in the first episode. The camera pans away from Daisuke for one second and he magically manifests a knife in his hand.<br />
<br />
I read in a review that the show didn&#039;t portray any sort of fanservice. This was obviously false. The antagonists shown are furries in skimpy or stupid outfits. A loli furry in a maid outfit and a big titted fox girl in the thinnest clothing you can allow on television. When I read about fanservice in a mech anime, I think generic mech action scenes that please mech anime patrons, I didn&#039;t expect actual full-blown fanservice from girls in the series. I&#039;m not saying fanservice is bad, or that it even needs a purpose sometimes, I&#039;m saying that it just came out of the blue. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it was just some big-titted girl flashing her boobs at the camera every other scene, but they threw in some animal girls with no real setup and just said it was the form the revisions chose to take. Ok then...<br />
<br />
Sound/Music 2/10<br />
<br />
I found the score composition for the series to be like the characters. Forgettable. Nothing made me want to listen to the music outside of the episodes. The only music I really enjoyed was the Opening by &quot;The Oral Cigarettes&quot;. I honestly can&#039;t write much about it, as the music didn&#039;t really evoke any emotions, it was just there. If you took out the music in some of the episodes and watched it, I doubt there would be much difference. Honestly, I think it might make the episode better in some cases.<br />
<br />
<br />
Should you watch it? 3/10 <br />
<br />
God no. After watching this show through its entirety, twice may I add, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone to watch this show for any reason. Not for the story, and not even for laughs. The only laugh I got out of it was the joy I felt after I finished the series, and this isn&#039;t a joke. If you&#039;re looking for a mech anime with meaningful story, just go watch Eureka Seven, or if you&#039;re looking for something similar to this but with slightly better writing, I would recommend Darling and the FranXX. The story is bad, with a confusing plot the main character could barely understand, twists that the writers thought were clever (But weren&#039;t), and characters as bland as cheerios. Usually, a story has a lesson to be taught in the end. This one was if you have a goal and put forth unwavering ambition, even at the cost of other people&#039;s safety, you should go forth and achieve it. The writers wanted it to be &quot;Believe in yourself when others ridicule you&quot; but it really just turned out wrong. After trying to hold myself back, I can finally say without a doubt that this is complete and utter trash.<br />
<br />
P.S. I tried not to mention the Director, as I&#039;m sure some reviewers have already done so, but he is most notable for Code Geass, another anime known for having mechs and a complex story. He just didn&#039;t do a great job this time around. <br />

    Here&#039;s a treat for SSSS.Gridman and Planet With fans. As for me, easily best of the 3. <br />
<br />
<br />
[spoilers:mild]<br />
<br />
<br />
Revisions is a story about this kid who was already during his childhood hinted he would be saving the world one day from &#039;something&#039;. Just so happens to be, during the high school phase his life starts rolling towards his &#039;destiny&#039; when bug-alien-robots come to his very school and start wrecking everything and killing students in brutal ways. Naturally, the original fortuneteller appears there, too, except she is not really &#039;she&#039; because the story is mysterious this way. Her role is to show how the world can be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298658">
        saved by piloting these mecha thingies which she brings with her so that the kid -- for unknown and unspecified reason -- needs to start piloting as of right now without any type of training or whatsoever. Why some trained elite soldier didn&#039;t do this or why he wasn&#039;t prepared for this job is a question that many similar mecha shows from million different Gundams to Xam&#039;d&#039;s have made the audience ask. But Revisions has an answer. <br />
<br />
This &quot;you&#039;re destined to save the world&quot; setup is a bad excuse for the story at best, no doubt, but it can be forgiven to great extent for the series&#039; good sides. However, it will be a time-consuming task since the content itself is rather dull and soulless for the entire first half of the show. Many viewers are bound to lose interest and the reward will only please a niche audience. Our main characters beat the aliens without there even being a learning curve because apparently that&#039;s not an important aspect of the show but the good part is that this really is the case and how it is all intended. Instead, politics and government as well as different parties from civilians to child-soldiers play a heavy role here to create certain type of multi-perspective concept where it is not fully clear who is who and who the &quot;baddies&quot; actually really are in this series if there even are any. Again, for the entire first half of the show, this aspect of the story mainly reminds me of The Walking Dead tv series except it doesn&#039;t make much sense in this world where it works this way by default and not as the outcome of 10 years of zombie apocalypse. However, things are explained and it all end up making making sense surprisingly well. The &quot;mystery&quot; elements and the reveal of the &quot;truth&quot; are somewhat impressive/well-planned and, even for me as a person who typically sees mystery elements as cheap excuses or plot-devices; the selling point of the show.<br />
<br />
To put the story simply: Definitely not for casual viewing. Not a beginner-friendly anime. It&#039;s not the most solid thing from its setup and plot-advancement nor does its jumpiness and pacing make the experience better, but it offers a unique world, new take on its genre and mystery elements that aren&#039;t for once self-explanatory but not completely foreshadowing-lacking asspulls either. A mature anime containing gore, dealing with some highly questionable subjects and contains several brutal scenes that children definitely should not see. As a whole, the story is full of problems no doubt, but also contains a highly unique approach which I found to be a success. <br />
<br />
In terms of characters, our main is portrayed a hero. His friends vary from extra shy girl with glasses to people who hate him because he is such an arrogant moral soldier who lives to protect. Fortune teller is basically the only capable adult in the series while the job of other adults consists of quite literally fucking shit up more than the &#039;aliens&#039; did. Especially people from the government are made so one-dimensional it&#039;s almost as if their sole purpose is to make the audience hate their thoughts and actions. The &quot;villain&quot; side contains some epic characters such as animal ears and tails wearing furry whose costume consists of sexy swimsuit parts, talking raccoon thingie who explodes once in a while and loli maid because that&#039;s the best kind of maid. It&#039;s pretty safe to say finding a person who appreciates these characters for their low-effort personalities will be a hard task, but they come with genuinity and realism of the kind that is rarely seen in anime these days which alone is worth some praise. <br />
<br />
From the production department, we are looking at a typical Netflix anime. CGI animation, terribly awkward character movements. Rough and the opposite of fluid/polished. Otherwise the art and color pallet are rather pretty to look at. The mecha design is lol-worthy and monster design most likely the outcome of speed drawing competition. Voice acting and OST are of respectable quality. Some bigger names are present and the BGM was surely fitting, offering decent action wobs and making some of the scenes much more entertaining to watch as they would have otherwise been. The dialogue was definitely more interesting to follow thanks to the decent seiyuu work. <br />
<br />
Considering the recent Netflix shows, I would say this is a perfect place to lose all hope.. on good animation. Those who can grab onto the mystery elements and the &quot;story unfolds&quot; side of the narrative will most definitely end up enjoying Revisions, but it will never gather an army of fans praising it. There are plenty of reasons to hate this show, so be warned; it really is not for everyone to approve of.

    Can delusional protagonists ever serve an interesting purpose? <br />
How much does absolute originality determine the merits of fiction?<br />
Or why, indeed, would you want to give Revisions a chance?<br />
<br />
In essence, I believe this series can be reasonably entertaining as the more or less straightforward sci-fi tale of five teenagers suddenly being transported into a barren future, where the entire population of Shibuya also needs to survive and adapt to these new conditions. Likewise, the show focuses on a fairly interesting thematic exploration about the concept of destiny within a context where time travel is possible. All of this is portrayed in a rather succinct manner without

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299417">
        much room for filler or distractions. If you can manage to latch onto either of these main aspects, you might want to check out Revisions.<br />
<br />
Having said that...there&#039;s a lot more to consider about the show in terms of its strengths and weaknesses in order to explain why, at least based on my experience, the series has enough value to compensate for any flaws.<br />
<br />
STORY: 7/10<br />
<br />
On an introductory level, what will probably make or break the story of Revisions in the eyes of many viewers is the protagonist: Daisuke Dojima. Logically enough, the prospect of following a main character with a delusional and overbearing personality can often be a drag. I do not blame any individual viewers for finding this to be an issue, particularly early on.<br />
<br />
Be that as it may, the story quickly establishes a very specific reason why Daisuke holds such questionable beliefs about heroism: a childhood prediction about his destiny. It&#039;s not an entirely senseless ideal. And yet, right from the start, the show also signals to the audience that Daisuke&#039;s behavior is a problem in reality. Adults and teenagers alike hold him in greater or lesser degrees of contempt. Revisions is not interested in merely patting this young man on the back and giving him a free pass.<br />
<br />
To put it another way, instead of portraying the protagonist&#039;s so-called &quot;hero syndrome&quot; in isolation, much of the story deals with how his delusional behavior affects other people and the world around him. In other words, there is plenty of skepticism built into the narrative regarding the true worth and meaning of the &quot;destiny&quot; that motivates Daisuke. Which, from my point of view, helped keep me invested in continuing to watch even when the protagonist was not behaving in a respectful or gentle manner.<br />
<br />
In fact, I&#039;d estimate over half of the storyline reflects an implicitly or explicitly cynical perspective towards his heroic ambitions and, more to the point, a harsh view of the original predictions behind it. What&#039;s ultimately more important for the writers of the show, in the long run, is not exactly what Daisuke thinks about himself as opposed to the reasons why he believed such a thing and their implications. This might seem like a subtle distinction, at a glance, but I&#039;d argue it is a relevant one.<br />
<br />
Without going into any detailed spoilers, the time-related angle ends up becoming increasingly relevant in order to illustrate this theme as the story develops. By the end of the narrative, the prediction that fueled Daisuke&#039;s destiny doesn&#039;t have quite the same meaning anymore. Furthermore, it also plays a role in determining the character development of certain additional individuals. Thus, while Revisions has been described as yet another work about heroism, which is an entirely understandable reaction, I do believe that emphasizing this too much would be a case of missing the forest for the trees. <br />
<br />
On that note, this brings me to the setting of Revisions. Most of the series takes place within the limits of Shibuya, in addition to occasional trips to the surrounding future wasteland. Inside this unfamiliar environment, the narrative briefly addresses both the changing reactions of the general population as well as the internal power struggles between the remaining government officials. <br />
<br />
In retrospect, I would argue the show was more interested in portraying the tensions between the youth and the ensuing leadership conflicts instead of fully exploring the former aspect, which was reflected in the allocation of running time. The direct ideological contrast between Chief Kuroiwa and Mayor Muta as rival authority figures might be essentially by the book, so to speak, but it was sufficient as a secondary framing device without replacing the core of the narrative. Once that element was no longer necessary, it faded into the background in an appropriate manner.<br />
<br />
Naturally, we did get to see various scenes depicting a mix of chaos, impatience, improvisation, mood swings and tensions among the common people. Mind you, I do get the impression that this sort of process could have been handled more smoothly with additional episodes. As things stand, it&#039;s more lean and to the point rather than truly comprehensive. At times, it might feel like certain factions among the citizens are behaving in an irrational manner, but I would argue that is an ugly yet inevitable side of humanity. Contrary to what some of us might hope for, communities living in desperate times are susceptible to disorganization, gullibility and selfishness. You can find plenty of reasons for such responses. Therefore, those scenes are unfortunately brief yet still qualify as realistically written.<br />
<br />
Moving on to the role played by the String Puppets, a term referring to the power suits that provide the mecha action content of Revisions...they&#039;re primarily a means to an end. Decent enough for the purposes of entertainment. As is common in the vast majority of mecha anime, this implies we will see teenagers piloting robots in order to fight, but I would argue this show did at least mention why that would be possible. One part of the explanation is purely technological in nature (their interface and the assistance provided by artificial intelligence) and, as confirmed a few episodes later, the other is connected to the time travel factor.  <br />
<br />
To be sure, I will readily admit that, on a structural level, Revisions is not aiming for raw originality. Of course, tales of teens fighting monsters or surviving during a crisis are not exactly new premises. Time travel has been a sci-fi storytelling staple for decades too. It would also be quite easy to make a list of seemingly major revelations around the halfway mark that may legitimately surprise the cast of characters but, at the same time, will surely seem commonplace in the eyes of any sufficiently experienced science fiction fan.<br />
<br />
My own stance is that science fiction premises can only aspire to create the illusion, as opposed to the reality, of originality at this point in history. For example, think about some of your favorite sci-fi anime or television series from recent years. There&#039;s a very big chance that such works are either part of a pre-existing property or, failing that, effectively based on adapting or re-interpreting a story that has already been told before.<br />
<br />
Even so...I would say the last couple of episodes of Revisions did employ one or two creative twists, thus arguably containing a more or less unexpected combination of elements when compared to the rest of the show. Mind you, I will acknowledge that these final events will not necessarily be to everyone&#039;s taste either. It seems easy enough to lose track of certain details, particularly if you have forgotten (or skipped) some tidbits of information that were only briefly referenced before.<br />
<br />
Was there enough foreshadowing in order to properly connect the dots? I would say so, strictly speaking, but perhaps just barely in certain areas. Suffice to say that, while I do not give the narrative the highest possible marks and the writing could be more blatant than necessary during certain dramatic beats, I feel the story generally wrapped up the main themes in a satisfactory manner and left the principal characters in an alright state. <br />
<br />
There is enough room left at the end for a sequel or spin-off, which I wouldn&#039;t be opposed to watching, but until that happens...the epilogue appears to be a purely symbolic gesture. For that matter, it might also be used as a plot point in the upcoming mobile game tie-in. Who can say?<br />
<br />
As a final note....following in the footsteps of most fictional stories involving time travel, a series like Revisions cannot escape the emergence of potential paradoxes, especially when curious viewers attempt to reconstruct the entire temporal landscape. We do receive useful explanations about quantum brains and time manipulation mechanics, which are arbitrary by definition but should cover the main questions. However, they are not totally comprehensive. In retrospect, we didn&#039;t get to witness everything firsthand and so would need to make various extrapolations based on indirect data. Frankly, I do not believe this is the most important part of the experience, but those who are usually troubled by such concerns might want to relax.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 6/10<br />
<br />
While the cast of Revisions was suitable for the purposes of telling its storyline, there is a valid line of criticism regarding their moderate to limited depth. In short, much of the characterization remains within standard anime parameters and only a few members of the ensemble crew were significantly developed. <br />
<br />
That said, I would also say they were usually properly written. Just not in the most granular or decompressed manner. Therefore, as far as anime teenagers are concerned, I would say these are not particularly offending examples. <br />
<br />
We have already discussed &quot;our hero&quot; before, the annoying Daisuke Dojima. It is fair to say that many will find him absolutely intolerable but, as explained above, I believe his annoying personality feeds into a valid storytelling purpose. Truthfully, the reactions he generates among the rest of the cast also provide entertaining dynamics over time. Despite the expected expressions of dislike...I feel there is also the potential for a certain amount of relatability, especially among viewers who may have been at least slightly delusional during their childhood and thus recognize parts of Daisuke&#039;s overly intense personality. While he shrugs off most critics at first, certain key challenges do have a cumulative impact on Daisuke. Rather than becoming another person...one could argue that, by the end of the story, his worldview was successfully refocused.<br />
<br />
Milo, the attractive young woman who set the original prediction in motion, remains calm and professional during the majority of the narrative. She&#039;s in the awkward role of needing to provide assistance to the Shibuya defenders against the Revisions yet still lacks enough power and is restricted by her duties. As much as she is connected to the time travel plotline, she may not be fully aware of the consequences of her actions or omissions. Milo tends to be more of an observer and a mentor, in practice, but she gradually starts to show a more genuine interest in the fate of these teenagers and her personality does shift as a result. Generally, this all works out. Having said this, I think she&#039;s the one character who would get the most out of any potential sequel to Revisions. What little we learned of Milo&#039;s past was interesting enough, but I had expected to see more interactions with her peers. <br />
<br />
The Steiner twins, Gai and Lu, were close enough to a state of normalcy. They were usually skeptical of Daisuke&#039;s impulsive behavior and were generally dependable members of the Shibuya Defense team. Not especially colorful, either way, but they are effective as representatives of how rational people would (ideally) think and act under the circumstances. They do show a wider emotional range than initially expected, rather than simply copying each other, but they are not at the center of any great drama. <br />
<br />
Keisaku mostly serves a supporting role as the protagonist&#039;s best friend with a slightly self-deprecating attitude and occasional mediator between Daisuke and other individuals, but they did find ways to connect him to the larger story. One was fairly dramatic yet relatively predictable and the other was actually more interesting. I&#039;d consider it as slightly surprising or even amusing. <br />
<br />
Mari, the shy would-be love interest, gets a couple of brief emotional sequences and deals with a certain ethical dilemma that viewers will either sympathize with or find to be too stereotypical. At the very least, I was content with the resolution of that issue. I wish they had figured out how to provide her with a more elaborate sub-plot, but I imagine it wasn&#039;t easy to do so with only 12 episodes.<br />
<br />
Chief Kuroiwa and Mikio Dojima, Daisuke&#039;s uncle, were both decently useful as adults with a comparatively solid amount of logic and common sense. As you can imagine, they also happen to confront Daisuke in the process and are skeptical of his actions. While their total amount of screen time was limited, albeit for different reasons in each case, they were still necessary as sources of balance and directly intervened in a few of the major sequences. Overall, I wanted to see more of them.<br />
<br />
On the antagonist side, Nicholas was arguably the single best character and had the most distinct personality among the Revisions organization. It sounds very strange to say that about someone who looks like a stuffed dog mascot, but it&#039;s true! Honestly, the 3D animation worked pretty well with his cartoony design and expressions. His use of English (or, to be accurate, Engrish) made for good amusement value too. Besides his whimsical attitude, Nicholas brought complications and complexity to the story. Which will likely be either liked or disliked by the audience, but I was clearly in favor of the results.<br />
<br />
Chiharu and Mukyu, the other two named members of the Revisions faction, were more memorable (or infamous) due to their over-the-top designs than for anything else. Out of everyone else in this show, they looked the most like utterly stereotypical anime characters: a bunny girl and a maid. Yes, that all sounds weird and dissonant in this context. <br />
<br />
On the one hand, those are openly stated to be digital devices for remote communication and not physical bodies. I guess it might even be partially meant as a blatant in-joke: in the far future, someone could have reached the odd conclusion that anime cosplay would be better received than formal wear during negotiation attempts with 20th century Japanese people. On the other hand, it is still an arbitrary decision that, at least in Chiharu&#039;s case, also appears to be little more than an excuse to have a small number of fanservice shots. Thankfully, that doesn&#039;t last too long.<br />
<br />
Mayor Muta, ostensibly the top authority figure of Shibuya, is a spineless individual that exists to show the darker sides of government during a crisis. In a few words, he prefers to work in his own interest and will take the easy way out. Without input from an external structure and subjected to public pressure, Muta can be either foolish or dangerous. Which makes for a viable form of contrast with Chief Kuroiwa&#039;s more inclusive leadership style. I enjoyed seeing their discussions but, in the end, that doesn&#039;t really manage to make Muta a strong character. <br />
<br />
SOUND:  6.5/10<br />
<br />
For the record, I am not an expert on musical criticism and prefer to avoid the use of any complicated terminology. <br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, the soundtrack of Revisions was neither exceptional nor an obstacle to my enjoyment. It seemed to supplement the action without any particular misfires. In short, standard stuff. I can also point out, however, that the opening theme was quite catchy and wasn&#039;t clashing with the animated sequence.<br />
<br />
Not much of a surprise, but the voice performances were all professional and fitting for the respective characters.<br />
<br />
ART AND ANIMATION: 7/10<br />
<br />
At long last, we have come upon the real elephant left in the room! <br />
<br />
Revisions was primarily animated through the use of 3D computer graphics. This single decision, I&#039;d strongly suspect, will remain a handicap for the series even based on principle alone. While there have been rare exceptions that avoid the rule, it&#039;s unusual for 3D anime to find much of an audience among the most outspoken fans of traditional animation techniques. Truth be told, I can understand this. I prefer 2D animation myself and, yes, it&#039;s also the case that 3D movement can be either disorienting or just plain confusing to watch.<br />
 <br />
Keeping that in mind...I think the staff of Revisions has made a good attempt to implement 3D animation in a technically superior manner, compared to similar contemporary anime, but it also slips up from time to time. In other words, I&#039;d label the results as above average 3DCG, rather than setting a high water mark. Sadly, this is not equal to Land of the Lustrous. How could it be? Then again, I don&#039;t think that was a strict obligation. <br />
<br />
Multiple anime studios have worked on improving their 3D processes over the years. Outcomes vary and so do audience preferences on the subject. As someone who has been watching anime for many years, this is still a big step forward compared to what was happening less than a decade ago. I&#039;ve had some issues with jarring 3D animation in the past that were either solved or at least minimized this time around. Thanks to the relatively simple character designs for most of the cast in Revisions, the facial expressions and body language are often easier to accept than what you&#039;d expect from a 3DCG anime made for TV broadcasting and/or Netflix streaming. <br />
<br />
During certain episodes, or long portions of them, I forgot that this was supposed to be a 3D anime and completely bought into the illusion. In fact, the 2D background art seemed to mesh rather well with the models too. That&#039;s a clear victory in my book. Unfortunately, not every single scene was successful at this. I can only imagine that certain sequences would have required extra manual modifications and they simply weren&#039;t done. Similarly, the framerate seemed to vary and it stood out as inconsistent at times.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, I think Nicholas looked impressive in almost every scene. Furthermore, the action sequences with the String Puppets benefit from the use of 3D animation in order to arrange some good choreography. It probably wouldn&#039;t be too easy to animate these unorthodox power suits with 2D either. This isn&#039;t exactly a show with a high dose of mecha action, but what was there seemed to be competently handled on the technical front.<br />
<br />
How about the lip-syncing then? By and large, even purely traditionally animated TV productions aren&#039;t really paying much attention to that in Japan. In other words, the anime industry is bad at this and many studios don&#039;t care. Compare the English language dubs to the original Japanese voice acting. Most of the time, you&#039;ll notice the dub directors and actors probably made more of a real effort to match the lip flaps than the VA crew in Japan. Given that underlying reality, I didn&#039;t notice anything out of the ordinary here.<br />
<br />
Curiously enough, not every single character was a 3D model. It&#039;s worth addressing that there are a few flashback sequences featuring children in 2D animation. Odd, in retrospect, but I feel the transitions worked in the moment.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 8/10<br />
<br />
Personally speaking, I had a reasonably fun and enjoyable time watching Revisions. <br />
<br />
In all honestly, I can tell several readers are probably taking a quick glance at this review right after looking at the lukewarm reception this anime has received thus far. Some will be confused by this contrast. In theory, roughly 3 out of every 10 viewers seem to be unhappy with the show. That&#039;s quite understandable. It is not my task to convince everyone to like the series, but simply to present a case for further consideration.<br />
<br />
Our media experiences will always be subjective. You&#039;ve probably heard that before. Suffice to say that the distribution of different tastes, interests and pet-peeves will never stop coloring how we react to a story and its characters. Any analysis, positive or negative, is affected by this. Especially when, as in the case of Revisions, we are presented with a protagonist who isn&#039;t easy to like. As matter of fact, Daisuke Dojima is much easier to hate. Or, perhaps worse, he might be plain boring. <br />
<br />
If nothing else, I have made an effort to expand on why that wasn&#039;t the case for me. <br />
<br />
Speaking to my own tastes, I&#039;ve found this series especially interesting as a fan of Infinite Ryvius, another sci-fi show made by the same director (Goro Taniguchi). Specifics aside, they are both shows that feature a group of annoying teenagers making bad choices in the middle of a crisis. I tend to find a certain fascination in the act of witnessing that sort of social conflictivity. Note that Revisions has a smaller-scale, feels relatively fast paced and doesn&#039;t have a lot of room to meander or dig deep inside certain topics, which is both a blessing and a curse, while Ryvius had the opportunity to explore a slower and more gradual progression.<br />
<br />
Overall, it is fair to say Revisions is not brimming with great narrative freshness. Science fiction stories have used one or more of these ideas before. Nevertheless, I think this show is acceptable in terms of general technical execution and did present a slightly more unusual mix of factors than what I had originally expected. There is also something to be said about appealing to fans of a certain theme and making a show focusing on that, even if it happens to be less popular than the alternative.<br />
<br />
Rather than expecting a truly novel masterpiece that will suddenly open my eyes to a new reality of storytelling, I believe this is good enough as an effective distraction. If this particular mix of elements appeals to you, then the experience might be worthwhile after all. If not, then you can and probably should move on to a more exceptional work. Take your time and think about it.<br />
<br />

    This anime was one of the worst things I have ever watched. The characters all act stupidly and have almost no redeeming qualities, the dialogue is forced and a slog to get through, the story is dumb, and there is almost no enjoyment to be had here.<br />
<br />
The only saving grace that this anime has is a decent soundtrack and some cool fights.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re honestly going to put yourself through this garbage, at least do yourself a favor and skip literally EVERYTHING but the fight scenes; that&#039;s the only worth this thing has at all, and even those aren&#039;t THAT entertaining. <br />
<br />
This was one of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298856">
        biggest wastes of time I have ever spent, and may god have mercy on you if you decide to watch it. <br />
<br />
I legitimately think that if you can watch this anime and think that it&#039;s good from the start to the end, you have brain damage.

    I almost didn&#039;t watch this because of the reviews. I am so pleased that I did. It was thoroughly enjoyable. Binged the entire thing in one evening. Each episode seamlessly moved into the next. Was like watching a long movie.<br />
<br />
The character development was good, the story was fun and the animation was great. The CGI weirded me out for the first several minutes but then I got used to it and actually started to like it.<br />
<br />
Basically it shows me that I really need to try things myself and not base my decision to watch things on others opinions.

    Whilst looking through Netflix I came upon this show and started watching it knowing absolutely nothing about it.<br />
<br />
It probably would have been better if I&#039;d continued knowing nothing. My life is certainly none the richer for having spent any time with this show.<br />
<br />
Where to start?<br />
<br />
Well I suppose the appearance of the show. It looks disconcertingly ugly. Every character moves like an NPC in a mid-2000s video game. The facial expressions are borderline uncanny valley territory. Everything just looks and feels off.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s the dialogue. I&#039;ve only watched this in dub, so maybe it&#039;s an issue with the dub, but I think it probably goes beyond

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309459">
        that. At any rate, there&#039;s barely a line delivered that sounds like it came from the mouth of an actual human being. To describe the dialogue as clunky is honestly generous. It&#039;s shockingly bad.<br />
<br />
The actual story is not the worst part of this show, but that&#039;s honestly not saying much. There&#039;s certainly nothing intriguing or novel about it beyond the purely conceptual.<br />
<br />
Beyond all of this is the protagonist. If he were bland that would actually be an improvement. From the very first moments he is actively irritating - and it doesn&#039;t get better from there. The supporting cast is mostly too bland to warrant mention.<br />
<br />
If, like me, you find yourself browsing Netflix one day and see this I strongly advise you keep browsing. It&#039;s not worth the time. The best I can say of this is that unless I re-read my MAL reviews one day in the future, I&#039;ll probably forget this show even exists.

    If you&#039;re reading this before watching, you won&#039;t regret completing this series.<br />
<br />
It is pretty interesting if you can get over (spoiler?) the MC&#039;s major case of chuunibyou. Whether you love him or hate him, the series is rewarding either way. I think that the story is really great and original. Not too hard to follow and keep track, although I wish there was more action in it. With the new CGI style that&#039;s slowly becoming frequent, the graphics is one of the best and smoothest that I&#039;ve seen so far and I really would have liked to see more fights in such CGI fluidity. On

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298718">
        another note, perhaps what would drive most people away is the MC, but I think he&#039;s displayed really well. Placing yourself in his shoes as you watch, it might be easier to understand why he acts the way he does. The other characters are well made and all of them have good, positive character development. All things considered, I&#039;m glad I stuck through with this series and hope that you enjoy(ed) it as much as I did. <br />
<br />
Looking forward for more! :D

    &quot;Anime is filled with goody two shoes white knight virgin MC&#039;s why wont we get some flawed MC that isnt the complete embodiment of a nice guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Daisuke is so annoying why wont he die already?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anime fans can never be pleased and this anime proves it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: Time travel shenanigans, mutant time travelling aliens gonna give it to ya, hero complex, time travels, my special power is to be pedophile and HARV help us for the love of god.<br />
<br />
Art: After episode 2 or 3 you are totally inmunized against the CGI in this anime.<br />
I felt that the art was great and the characters looked good, i

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307900">
        also apreciated the character design of most of the characters (except the revision sisters).<br />
<br />
Sound: There are several instances in which you could imagine a evil guy laughing maniacally because anime, someone tought it would be a good idea to make the sides of the story be fully white and black. It isnt groundbreakingly bad but it definitely is a minus to the enjoyement of the experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: I love Daisuke. I love how fucking annoying, stupid and flawed he is.<br />
He isnt a bucket of fresh air in anime MC&#039;s. He is the embodiment of originality and i highly doubt well see a MC as attractive as him in many years.<br />
Milo characterization, mental traumas and her background are pretty damn well written but her facial expressions are kinda weak. One could argue that since she is supposed to be a neutral party and be a soldier that obeys orders she cannot show strong emotions but damn a lot of times some scenes could have been drastically improved if she smiled, laughed or showed despair.<br />
Temari was tits. This means that her character is so uninteresting and irrelevant to the plot that she could have been replaced by tits and nothing could have changed.<br />
The wonder twins. While Gai seems to be the most mature of the group im kinda annoyed at the fact that he is flawless and can pretty much perfectly adapt to the chaos surrounding him.<br />
Lu its like a downgraded version of Gai but at the very least she isnt annoying and naggy like her brother.<br />
Keisaku is a mixed bag. At the start you kinda don&#039;t care too much about him but as the story unfolds he shows more emotions and his character feels more interesting to follow.<br />
The side protagonists were pretty good. Despite having no superpowers they felt reliable and capable and the many callbacks to the city state definitely helped to keep the story on edge.<br />
Why they dont get a properly written death is beyond me but whatever.<br />
Side antagonists were... meh. On one hand they started with incredibly good arguments for their actions and train of toughts but they suddenly derailed into mustache evil monocle villains who went out of their way to be creepy and unattractive.<br />
The antagonists had some horrible character designs who were pretty much poor taste fanservice.<br />
Nicholas arc and importance in the history was original and his reasoning was down to earth. Something seldom seen in anime villains.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and overall progress of the anime:<br />
Daisuke alone is powerful enough to carry the crystal clear flaws of the show (fan service, some pathetic &quot;plot twists&quot;, Temari, Gai and uncomfortable touching).<br />
The story sometimes gets harder to follow but by the end they pretty much close every plot and it feels like you werent actually robbed of your time for watching it.<br />
The time travel mechanics are kept simple and clear.<br />
And sure there are a lot of things that were pretty tasteless and poorly made but they have almost no effect on the overall story so you can roll your eyes and continue watching.<br />

    Revisions is poorly an alright anime. Surprisingly the CG is not that bad, fights so-so; the plot ended up “”working”” as it was propitious; the characters development was a joke. Really. Like, really a joke.<br />
<br />
I believe the ideal plot was not that bad, because the story has some interesting parts and twists, but the way it ended up appealing with instant cliches just didn’t work. You don’t buy the pitiful yet hopefully-gonna-change-for-good protagonist Daisuke as a miracle hero. He acts like a hysteric bitch for 10 episodes, then suddenly becomes the super caring and empathetic friend at the last 2 episodes. It’s ridiculous. <br />
<br />
You can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303425">
        enjoy Revisions as an average anime. But expect shitty character development.

    I will start off with a summary of the show to explain why I like and dislike certain aspects.<br />
<br />
<br />
This show starts out with quite an annoying MC at which most viewers agree to him being extremely annoying, maybe even the sole reason of dropping the show. But this character gets the biggest personal growth, which is a nice thing to see. He is cocky and extremely arrogant. A saddening combination.<br />
<br />
Revisions, the title itself, is actually quite an enormous spoiler. The show involves multiple timelines where a new timeline will be predicted based on changes made in the past. A certain corporation has special agents ensuring

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298683">
        the right changes are made, from which we know the agent Milo. A truly lovable and logical girl that simply is there to do her job. <br />
<br />
The year 2007 (might be a couple of years off) is where everything started. A small cast of youngsters will either save or destroy the future for mankind due to a new deadly virus being released. When they are children they interact with a time traveling agent without knowing it. But this is when their faith has changed. <br />
<br />
Each of them grows up in their own way to the present where they are teens. All except for one have life goals, but then a big disaster happens which results in a whole city being transported roughly 300 years in the future to a barren wasteland where the virus is ruling. Humanity has perished and it is up to them to make it back save in their own time. With them I mean their entire city, not just our MC crew. <br />
<br />
Their ordeal in a new era is filled with personal growth, action and an actually decent story. While some are cocky others try to grasp the new situation and to adjust. <br />
<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t consider the information above a spoiler but rather something necessary to understand the overall plot better while watching, because this show covers 2 complex factors; time travel and alternate time lines. As similar as they may sound there is a significant difference between the two. This show expressed the difference really well. <br />
<br />
With that comes a whole bunch of important characters, there isn&#039;t an actual main character. Plenty of them have their own given roles with everything being properly and logically animated. Even the characters at the back that are barely shown. Most of these characters experience quite the growth due to the sudden extreme change of environment. In just one episode you can understand what the mindset of most of them is and after a couple you can see how the whole ordeal affects them. And honestly not many shows nail that factor.<br />
<br />
This show also has no fan service. That means more time for actual story and growth. Some things are cliche though which had an impact in my grading for character development, while the enjoyment was mainly affected by the cocky arrogant type. Otherwise the grades would be an 8 for them with an overall 8. <br />
<br />
Art is a tough one. I am not fond of CGI but I guess I&#039;ve either accepted it without knowing or they actually have good quality CGI. I can&#039;t complain much about it. I&#039;d rather have it drawn the traditional way, but this is just a matter of preference. <br />
<br />
Finally, sound effects are nothing special. Good voice actors, fairly basic effects. No extra special sound effects for environments to make it sound more immersive. But this is just nitpicking. <br />
<br />
So after this long wall of text, I do recommend watching it, especially if you&#039;re into shows that are about time travel / alternate time lines! <br />
<br />
Also side note, it is classified as a mecha anime, but don&#039;t expect something like Gundam or Gridman. It is more like fancy exosuit prototype. So if you explicitly look for mecha, this might be a let down. <br />

    I have a habit of completing an anime that I start. So I got this anime recommended by Netflix and it&#039;s cover was really appealing so I gave it a shot. Took me 4-5 days to complete it because this anime is complete shit and I wanted a break from episode to episode from this shit show. <br />
I&#039;ll be straight to the point, I&#039;ve never seen such a shit anime like this before.<br />
<br />
1. Story - Well, story is nothing but they made it bit complicated because it has time travel in it. You will never know what&#039;s actually happening and where the series is trying

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310685">
        to get to. Each episode doesn&#039;t really build up a story for rest of episodes but each episodes creates new plot holes and some of stuff doesn&#039;t even make sense because of characters. Each episode is rushed but it doesn&#039;t really matter because there is nothing to this story. First 9 episodes were torture, last 3 episodes is where you find things bit interesting. The ending was like any other classic anime and they left some clues at the end for another season but there&#039;s no cliffhanger so it&#039;s ok if they don&#039;t make another season and trust me you won&#039;t want it either.<br />
<br />
2. Sound - It has 1 op and 1 ed song that are actually cool and nice. Dialogues felt off at some scenes but other than that sound effects were great.<br />
<br />
3. Art - Art is alright but not appealing. Majority of anime community don&#039;t like this type of anime and that&#039;s understandable. It was watchable and fight scenes were really cool. They showed blood and violence and couple of people getting killed but that&#039;s all. <br />
<br />
4. Characters - Main protagonist was fucking horrible. He was annoying and shit and had a hero thing going on his mind till first 7 episodes. Then he went decent after 8 episode but not likable. Just like main protagonist, every other characters were crap and even villains were worst. Villains were joke and every character was stupid. Only character I actually like was Kesaku Asano, only good character in entire anime. <br />
<br />
OVERALL - I didn&#039;t enjoy this anime. Story was horrible and so were characters. Art was appealing. I found first 10 episodes waste of time and it was torture and boring. Liked the last 2 episodes because of the whole time travel thing was there. I won&#039;t recommend anyone to watch and will probably forget about it myself until I read my review again lol.

    At the beginning, I really hated this series.<br />
The 3D graphic and character movement looked so unnatural and the protagonist was so annoying.<br />
The story was weird, the monsters ugly and I didn&#039;t like the behavior of the most characters.<br />
The protagonist thinking he was better than everyone else and he aggressively was hard to endure, but on the other hand, this made a great room for character development.<br />
Unfortunately, this happened way too late, and even if it made sense from a story point of view, but for everyone who might not like the protagonist, the first part of the Anime would be relatively horrible.<br />
(The same thing with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336815">
        Milo by the way, just in a little bit less annoying form)<br />
<br />
But episode after episode this Anime got better.<br />
I started to like the characters, the story begun to become something really good and if I just had to rate the last 3 episodes, this anime surly would get a 8-9, but unfortunately, the beginning wasn&#039;t good at all.<br />
<br />
But I appreciate the idea and the way it was told.<br />
For everyone who is okay with Netflix Anime, which aren&#039;t &quot;real&quot; Anime from my point of view, this Anime developed into something quite good, if you are able to endure the worst things in the beginning.<br />
I was just glad I didn&#039;t drop it, and I encourage you to endure the same.<br />
I think it could be worth it.<br />

    NOT ACTUALLY BAD <br />
I think the main reason people give it a bad rating is because either the art is SUPER cgi or the MC can be a whiney bitch. But I honestly hated how it looked but I got used to it eventually, and the MC *minor spoiler* has great development. lowkey reminds me of how eren from attack on titan can be. If you can just manage those 2 things, you&#039;re in for a treat. this anime has a pretty cool concept and even if it isn&#039;t the deepest or original anime, it definitely has a good story to keep you interested. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309091">
        pacing can be a bit wonky but not too bad. I honestly really enjoyed this even though I considered not watching it just because of the animation style. PLS watch it despite the bad animation style! I give the character an 8 because maybe they kept the mc an annoying brat for too long, but it was tolerable and happened fast enough I never actually got super pissed at him, but I do try to put myself in their shoes, so I can be a bit more forgiving abouthis type of stuff. Overall a fun watch!

    I really want to like this series.  It looks and sounds good.  It has some juicy sci-fi stuff in it.  But the characters are really bad, the tropiest tropes possible.  They are not the result of a cookie cutter, the ARE the cookie cutter.  The main character is the absolute worst.  A whiny, arrogant brat that &quot;hero complex&quot; doesn&#039;t even begin to approach.  <br />
<br />
The characters are thrown into their role as the robot suit wearing protectors at such a break neck pace and with absolutely no pomp and circumstance and everyone simply accepts it to be the case.

         if your thinking of watching this drivel and your an adult, burn it with fire.  If you are a young person, there are better things to watch.<br />
<br />
Another anime dud, thanks Netflix.

    I&#039;ll make this extremely succinct: overall, the anime is interesting and a good way to pass time if you have nothing else to do (like I didn&#039;t). The story is decent, the construction of the characters could&#039;ve been better, but, in the end, it&#039;s ok. Gai is plainly REAAAAALY annoying most of the anime and Daisuke is mildly annoying most of the anime (though they do redeem themselves in the final). The story could&#039;ve been better structured and elaborated - as the characters could&#039;ve been better thought (specially Gai and Daisuke); however, where it counts, the anime was really interesting and entertaining. The art of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310538">
        it was decent - although I do think the action scenes could&#039;ve been improved: the animators just used waaay too much of CGI (and not in the good sense, such as Shingeki no Kyojin). The sound was also decent - nothing remarkable to be said about it; although, the sound mixing in the action scenes was good enough for the scenes to be good overall. I really did enjoy the anime! As I said, there could&#039;ve been some improvements, but the premise was really interesting and the suspense and mystery throughout the story made it really addictive (I watched all of it on the weekend). Overall, I&#039;d say it&#039;s worth to watch - although have it in mind it&#039;s not a masterpiece. And, though my opinion only matters to me (still, you did read this far), in the mecha genre, I liked it more than Code Geass. I&#039;m sorry, not sorry. Peace.<br />
<br />
Story (7) + Art (6) + Sound (6) + Character (5) + Enjoyment (8) = Overall (7)<br />
<br />
PS: I really do hope Netflix approves a second season.<br />

    See this anime thinking the following: many people saw kaifuku an anime that is terrible that only gets a note for being basically a hentai that supplies the fetish of some.(That&#039;s my opinion)<br />
<br />
This anime has the problem of heavy CG so watch him thinking only about history and some moments of struggle. Taking into account this big problem, there are other small problems like the lack of impact in some scenes, but I believe that if this anime were made by a bigger studio it would be better in several points, but it is what we have for today.<br />
<br />
About this anime I can honestly say

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394856">
        that the only problem is the heavy CG. I hope you like the anime !!!

    Revisions is neither the worst anime ever made nor is it a groundbreaking masterpiece. This anime is worth watching for its dedication to creating a distinct artistic impression with a heartfelt message.  It&#039;s interesting how low of a score it has on MAL given that many a worse anime has scored far better here.  Some of the characters in the story have annoying character traits (that serve a purpose), the story is full of pseudo-science plot holes, and the production process itself uses CG animation that may alienate some viewers.  If you can get past these largely superficial problems, digging deeper you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304675">
        may be rewarded by an interesting, if disjointed, experience.<br />
<br />
The setup will seem familiar to most of you.  Five high school friends share the role of protagonist, with a boy named Daisuke designated as the narrator.  First and foremost, Revisions is a science fiction anime about time travel.  Our high school students will battle futuristic beasts while piloting mecha.  A few slice of life scenes are sprinkled in, along with the usual dash of relationship drama between these five.  Of course, their job is to save the world.  Along the way they will be aided by adults who provide mature contrast to the emotional (but honest) outbursts from the children.  All of this is to be expected, as by now there seems to be a formula for this type of show.<br />
<br />
So what makes Revisions distinctive enough to be worth your time?  First of all, the artwork is very good.  Some reviewers have complained about the use of CG animation, but in this very season we have Date A Live III which contains an entire battle scene made up of still panels.  That production is laughably low-budget when compared to Revisions.  Revisions is beautifully drawn and animated.  Facial expressions are clear and distinct.  At no point were corners cut beyond what you might expect of a weekly television show.  So why all the hate?  I can only presume that some of you hate CG in your anime so much that you are motivated to come here and give artificially low scores to anything in this style.  If you are such a person, just avoid Revisions and save yourself some angst.<br />
<br />
Second, a great deal has been made of the &quot;hero complex&quot; of Daisuke, our main protagonist.  After watching all 12 episodes, I feel his character was written this way not out of some misplaced stab at originality, but rather as an earnest attempt to describe how someone might end up if he were told his destiny was to protect everyone.  In fact, the behavior and psychology of the high school kids was much more realistic and believable than that of comparable anime.  Why, then, did it get draw such criticism from some of the reviewers here?  <br />
<br />
I am just guessing, but I think Daisuke&#039;s character flaws hit a little too close to home for some viewers.  They recognize his immaturity as the same whiny, insecure little kid that lives inside of us.  I&#039;ll give you a little hint for life: growing up is not denying that inner kid, or hoping that annihilating him for all time will save you from future embarrassment or failure.  Real grown-ups give this inner kid a hug and a cookie from time to time and acknowledge that every single person is prone to moments of weakness.  Everyone was a noob at one point in life, and frankly, most of us still have a lot to learn.  If you are criticizing decent writing than maybe the point of it was lost upon you.<br />
<br />
In fact, there is a character named Gai who I believe represents this very attitude of trying to insult others due to insecurity about oneself.  Gai is constantly berating Daisuke for his bragging and delusions, while ironically harboring a not-so secret desire for leadership and recognition.  One envisions Gai&#039;s future destined for local politics or middle-management. <br />
 Including Gai shows some self-awareness on the part of the author.  Criticism of Daisuke, on the other hand, demonstates a possible LACK of self-awareness or confidence on the part of some reviewers.  There is an expression &quot;Methinks the lady dost protest too loudly.&quot;  When I see extreme negative reviews and scores, this phrase comes to mind.  Are you trying too hard to be cool by attempting to distance yourself from Daisuke?  But you&#039;re not Daisuke or the hero of any show you watch.  Maybe anime has conditioned you to insert yourself into the role of the male protagonist so well that, like a Pavlovian test subject, if the main character has too annoying a personality you feel personal insult as a knee-jerk reaction.  Once upon a time, good stories just wrote the characters as they needed to be written and the reader understood they should remain a separate (but attentive) viewer.<br />
<br />
That brings us to the quality of the story.  Overall, there are the usual suspects here with any science fiction written regarding time travel.  Paradoxes are not addressed.  Scientific logic is trod upon, or simply ignored.  At one point, the solution to rescuing someone trapped in space time apparently is to reach out to him physically.  If you are a pseudo-science nerd who thinks the physics in Star Trek is real, then you may find the willful indifference to actual science in this anime offensive.  Everyone else will probably just roll with it.<br />
<br />
But that is not the main point of the story.  Actually, I believe the main point is about the meaning of heroism, and how our actions are influenced by our self-image and ideals.  Do we really sacrifice for others, or do we simply appease our own egos?  This anime is brave enough to address these issues instead of automatically assigning the role of &quot;hero&quot; to some characters and &quot;villain&quot; to others.  In fact, all parties in this anime believe they are doing the &quot;right thing&quot; as it applies to their own personal ethics.  Judged against the standard of other anime, the story is much more well-formed than average.  There is an introduction, development, and a definite conclusion, with an overall purpose and message the author wishes to convey.  If you&#039;re just here for pretty explosions, then the battle scenes are done competently.<br />
<br />
If we may criticize anything about the story, it feels somewhat abridged in the service of fitting into the standard 12 episode format.  The final result is very watchable, but stilted.  Conversations and and character changes  jump around leaving you feeling that something important was skipped.  There is very little fan service (unless you consider form-fitting plug suits evocative).  Characters behave in a way you might expect given their unusual situation.  A lot of thought was given to the drama playing out in the people, and not so much to trying to be clever from a science fiction perspective.  For what it attempts to do, I believe it succeeds quite well.  I watched all twelve episodes without once feeling, &quot;this sucks so bad I have to stab myself in the eye immediately.&quot;  Given how many cringe-worthy anime are out there, Revisions deserves some recognition for its honest attempt at delivering its message about friendship and what it means to be a hero.

    It was one of the first anime I saw.<br />
<br />
I think the animation could improve. As for the script, I really liked it in the end. However, I think the beginning is a bit slow, and really the best part of it comes in the last chapters (where they made me really excited). It&#039;s a good script, but has it flaws. Maybe in the second part we&#039;l see more development in this area.<br />
<br />
The characters are interesting, however they could be developed further. They are endearing, but they do not stand out much or make you fall in love with them.<br />
<br />
Without a doubt, I think the best

    This could be a good anime. but its not.<br />
mainly because the main character, daisuke, is really bad. all the other characters are actually kinda cool.<br />
why daisuke ruins the show:<br />
Daisuke and friends when they were kids were out somewhere and daisuke was kidnapped and a woman called milo saved them but told daisuke &#039;one day danger will come and you will have to save everyone&#039; now milo saying this ruined the whole show because of that one sentence daisuke now all the way up till high school which is the present bascially thinks he has to protect everyone, so daisuke ends up being violent and attacking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320938">
        random people thinking they are gonna hurt his friends, one example is a man was asking one of the girl main characters for directions and then daisuke randomly jumped him thinking she was in danger, in the process the man ended up breaking his ribs. <br />
When this monster called a revision one day start attacking the school and KILLS his   classmates, Daisuke is HAPPY that finally the day has come for him to protect everyone. This makes him look like he thinks he is better than everyone else or something and makes him so annoying. Milo ends up saving them and says daisuke can save them by giving him this mecha suit called a string puppet, like why does milo keep on saying only daisuke can help, anyway he ends up using the suit still really happy for some reason and is moaning about how the suit isnt fast enough like no ur just crap at using it. If only they made Daisuke better and didnt give him this need to do everything by himself thinking only he can save them.
