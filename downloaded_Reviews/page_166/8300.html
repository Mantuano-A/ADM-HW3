    What do you usually get out of something that is inherently a marketing ploy, for an animation studio no less, for an anime? For the vast majority of people, they don’t really think of it that much and just go with the flow while they’re getting suckered into the gimmick. Not that there’s anything wrong with that at all. When the marketing has something to show for it with lots of fun creativity mixed in to make the experience worthwhile to go through, it can be conceived as quality entertainment for the masses. Now take most of those qualities away that make the show quality

          <span style="display: none;" id="review137535">
        entertainment and you have Super Sonico the Animation.<br />
<br />
Showcasing the boobilicious Super Sonico, the mascot of the company Nitroplus, the show is mainly existing just to appease to the fans of Sonico to have her own show where she is the main star. I, myself, never really knew much about this particular character outside of being just a part of some April Fools joke that Nitroplus put out in the ONA for Madoka Magica until I saw the poster for the Winter season and showed her in nothing but a tight slim bikini. Likewise, I was intrigued to see where Nitroplus was going with this angle of giving their own mascot some much needed life into her to make her more than just something purely for the sake of aesthetic beauty, for better or for worse. By the time I was half-way done with the show, I couldn’t help but wonder how a show like this can’t seem to get down the important steps of making a character endearing and charming.<br />
<br />
Getting right down to it, this whole show is mainly just about Sonico, and the show doesn’t even try to make the rest of characters even slightly interesting or entertaining. Sonico must have enough charisma to carry the show forward to keep the charm looking fresh on the eyes and pleasant to listen to with our ears. Unfortunately, the amount of personality is almost second to none by the simple fact that she’s just not a fleshed out character in the slightest. In the sense that whenever I look at Sonico, It’s not that she’s a bad character because her only reason for existing is that she has big breasts. It’s just that, all I see from her archetype is a mascot. Throughout the majority of the time, they do absolutely nothing to make her seem like more than just a mascot and we simply watch her do everyday activities without any significant growth.<br />
<br />
There’s even an episode where they actually give Sonico some bit of material that actually makes her more of a human character that involves her interacting with other people and learning about what they do and how they live out their lives, without any kind of fanservice shoved down our throats as most people would expect. Now this becomes a big problem in a form of a question: What is this show exactly supposed to be? Is it a purely fanservice show? A slice of life show? An all-girl rock band show? Or is it a zombie horror show? All of these genres mixed together in an episodic fashion, badly I might add, make Super Sonico a show extremely puzzling to figure out what it wants to be. It can be frustrating for me who just wanted a fun fanservice show to only have around 3-4 episodes entirely devoted to it and the rest are only partially present; and even those aren’t really that titillating to even be acknowledged.<br />
<br />
To extrapolate my point about Sonico being a flat character, many might see that her cheery personality and optimistic nature fuels her as likable and charismatic. You can have a character like Sonico just fine with those qualities, but you can’t just rely on them alone because it makes her as a person with no humanity. Like I said, since she’s nothing more than a mascot character, I can never see her as anything else but that unless she’s been given enough development for me or anyone to care about her. Sadly the amount of scenes that are shared with Sonico and her friends wouldn’t be enough to see Sonico as anything but vapid.<br />
<br />
As you might already know, Super Sonico’s music consists mainly of your standard J-rock compositions that play from the Opening, Ending, and some concert scenes in some of the episodes. These are actually some of the best qualities of Super Sonico. The opening theme is rhythmically fast and with a fast vocal performance that compliment each other very well. There’s always a different ED song in each episode which is always welcomed especially with a show that’s focused on music. The concert scenes, despite the rather average CG animation on the characters, are nice to listen to thanks to the top-notch vocals.<br />
<br />
The technical aspects of the show do have some high quality art to make the show look pretty by the animation studio White Fox, who’s no stranger to animating some of Nitroplus’s more well-known original works such as Steins;Gate. Not to say that Super Sonico achieves that same level of quality as that show, or even White Fox&#039;s other recent effort Hataraku Maou-sama. Sonico, herself, is drawn nicely with her firm thighs and nice breasts complimenting her well-endowed figure. I’ve briefly mentioned about the CG in the concert scenes and that’s probably the weakest aspect about the animation. Don’t come here and expect Angel Beats quality concert animation with this one. There were several moments where the drummer’s playing style wasn’t syncing correctly with the music and even with some of the guitar playing as well.<br />
<br />
I could consider this show as somewhat of a disappointment, but on the other hand, I wasn’t really expecting much either. There may have been some good ideas to show forth in giving some decent fanservice for the season, but after a while I just kept looking at the clock to see if the episode was almost over. The show just kept dragging on and on over really simplistic characters that aren’t all that enthralling or entertaining to look at. It’s far from the worst though. It would just be best to listen to the OSTs of the show and have fun with those than the actual fanservice. When even that becomes more memorable than the titillation, that’s not a negative to be taken lightly.<br />

    SuperSonico: The Animation started off well enough but quickly became a drag with very few redeeming factors. Unfortuately, Sonico was not fleshed-out nearly enough to sustain the show on her own, and an emphasis on fanservice rather than characterization really cheapened the whole experience.<br />
<br />
There are a loud group of anime fans who will tell you that Super Sonico The Animation is nothing more than a blatant Nitro+ publicity campaign designed to lure in the Otaku with a disproportionately sexy mascot. These people are not far from the truth. However, this a slight exaggeration because the show was not totally bereft of substance. Don’t get your

          <span style="display: none;" id="review137151">
        hopes up too high though.<br />
<br />
For a start – the OST was easily one of the best this season. Many scenes felt particularly magical thanks to an inspiring musical backdrop. Sonico’s band, First Astronomical Velocity, also provided plenty of ear-candy along the way. Think K-On! but a little more grown up. The OP was also neat, and a number of EDs (I love it when shows do this) were a bonus each time. It’s fair to say that the anime lacked in a few critical areas, but the music was spot-on every time.<br />
<br />
However… Besides the arguably decent animation quality, it’s all downhill from here.<br />
<br />
Sonico might be super-cute, but she’s also super-bland without a guitar in her hands. There was not a single piece of memorable dialogue over the course of the show, and the comedy was weak. I did find it consistently hilarious when Sonico would introduce herself as “…S-Super Sonico desu” to people (who would respond totally normally, as if this was a common female Japanese name) but that was about as funny as the show got. Being a total klutz at all times, Sonico would often find herself in a bunch of awkward jams – but the delivery was way too contrived and unnatural to get a laugh from me.<br />
<br />
Sonico’s band-mates were also disappointingly generic. Besides the musical aspect, neither of them had any real impact on the show. Furi-chan&#039;s VA was particularly irritating. There was more than ample time to develop them but by the end it had all been wasted on cheap fanservice and boring dialogue. While there is an emphasis on music, Super Sonico: The Animation is a slice-of-life anime first, and slice-of-life is nothing without a quality cast of characters.<br />
<br />
Again – the strength of Super Sonico: The Animation is in the music. Nothing else really managed to capitalize.<br />
<br />
Final verdict: Skip show, aquire OST.<br />
<br />
3/10<br />
<br />
Side Note:-<br />
<br />
While the show was mostly trash – episode 7 was entirely different. A surprisingly modest inclusion, it followed Sonico on a very personal journey of self-discovery and introspection. The pacing was perfect and everything just worked for once. Part of this was due to a lack of fanservice (besides a brief hot-springs scene, but it was pretty tame) but the episode stood up on its own. Call it a diamond in the rough.

    This is the first time I&#039;ve written a review on MAL, but I feel the need to because I think all people see when they look at this anime is Super Sonico and all that she and her merchandise implies and automatically discard it. While I can&#039;t really blame them for that because the merchandise implies a lot, I gave it a chance and was pleasantly surprised. While it&#039;s no masterpiece, the fanservice was mild, the characters outside of Sonico were actually interesting and engaging, the soundtrack was excellent, and overall it was enjoyable to watch. <br />
<br />
---Story 7/10---<br />
The anime was fairly episodic, and it didn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review140975">
        leave much for the fairly simplistic overarching plot of Sonico coming into her own as a band member and a model, but it was still well executed and the episodic subplots were well done and all contributed something to the base plot. <br />
<br />
---Art 7/10---<br />
It got across the point that it needed to and it didn&#039;t detract at all from the anime with too much 3DCG, low quality BGs, etc. <br />
<br />
---Sound 8/10---<br />
The music in the show was excellent and always fit the mood very well. The OP and the multitude of EDs were all well done and Sonico&#039;s band, First Astronomical Velocity, had quite a few catchy and well orchestrated songs. With the premise of the show being musical in nature, the good soundtrack gives it a good boost and made it fun to watch.<br />
<br />
---Characters 8/10---<br />
This is I think where this anime shines, and interestingly enough not because of the main characters, but the supporting characters. Every episode Sonico would go through some kind of ordeal that involved a side character that would develop throughout the episode and end up being affected positively somehow by her. They all had interesting backdrops to their scenarios and were given ample characterization in the small amount of time they were featured, and each one in some way or another contributed to the overall plot of the anime. There were also a few side characters that were in the background throughout the series that saw gradual development such as a chubby girl that came to terms with how she looked and even learned to embrace it through Sonico. <br />
<br />
The anime was made fun with the high quality soundtrack and the color saturated visuals, and each episode had an interesting premise with engaging side characters. It&#039;s not a must watch, but if you&#039;re looking for something to just casually watch that you&#039;ll enjoy for its simplicity and episodic nature, you won&#039;t be disappointed. <br />

    SoniAni: Super Sonico the Animation is a music, slice of life anime co-created by Nitroplus (the creators of Super Sonico) and White Fox (the creators of the anime); the anime has 12 episodes and aired between January and March 2014.<br />
<br />
Plot <br />
It is important to note that SoniAni: Super Sonico the Animation was designed as a marketing tool for Nitroplus to sell Super Sonico brand to people. Each episode we see a new day of Sonico’s life; she gets into different situations and different trials. It is an open secret that all slice-of-life shows don’t have a complex story;yet, it helps you to relax; that is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187164">
        why we watch SoL shows. In Sonico’s case, the show was sometimes boring; yet, it was a very funny experience for me. <br />
<br />
Main Characters<br />
Main Protagonist – Super Sonico - Voiced by Ayano Yamamoto (Nae Tennouji, Arisa Kajiwara) – She is an 18 years old college student that works as a model, a waitress at her grandmother’s restaurant and is in the band called First Astronomical Velocity with her two best friends; she has the position of the band’s vocalist and guitarist. Sonico always wears headphones and is never seen without them; she is easy to get embarrassed in front of other people, she sleeps so much that it requires someone to help her to wake up, she also can’t live without pasta. All in all, her character was funny for me: she tries her best to get the job done, even when it gets her into problems, she enjoys helping people with their problems and she always stays happy no matter what.<br />
<br />
Suzu Fujimi - Voiced by Mai Goto (Pina Sformklan Estor, Chelsea Blankett) – She is one of the Sonico’s best friends and a member of the First Astronomical Velocity as its bassist and leader. She normally wears a pink nurse uniform and tries to get Sonico to wear crazy outfits for concerts; Suzu is very amusing character: she always has a plan to solve problems and tries to help Sonico with her problems whenever she can do it.<br />
<br />
Fuuri Watanuki - Voiced by Mami Ozaki (Hana Isuzu .Elena Shiina) – She is also one of the Sonico’s best friends and a member of the First Astronomical Velocity as its drummer. She is very shy, always sleepy, or hungry. She was a very interesting character for me, as her indifference, has always caused problems to her friends and it was really funny.<br />
<br />
Presentation<br />
SoniAni has a very bright color scheme to draw the viewer to the life of Super Sonico, which is nice and fun. Alack, there were also some problems about the characters: the show focused on Sonico well, but the other characters didn&#039;t receive enough time for development, and it was a real problem of that show. The animation of the characters; on the other hand, is very well-made and looks great, except when it switches to a different style, when the OP and ED were shown; the animation in OP and ED was good, but for some reason, the animation in the anime was much worse. <br />
<br />
The voice actors did amazing job and I highly appreciated it; their characters looked alive and realistic; it was very pleasant for me. Finally, the music part was is one of the best things about the show; the songs fit every episode well.<br />
<br />
My opinion <br />
SoniAni is one of the anime, which I can’t hate, but I found it difficult to enjoy a show so similar to K-on, IdolMaster and others. The anime did everything to make its music scenes similar to Love Live’s, but when it works well in Love Live, in SoniAni it feels very forced and not needed. While I know the show was a marketing tool, they could have done a better job of presenting Super Sonico to the public; the story didn&#039;t feature anything new, some episodes were boring to watch and the style of animation used for the songs was much better than for the anime. I did enjoy Sonico’s, Suzu’s and Fuuri’s characters a lot, as they really carried the show for me, but the supporting character were dull and boring. <br />
<br />
The Verdict<br />
SoniAni is an anime that can only be enjoyed by a fan of the brand; its lack of the story, the focus on Sonico and bad development of supporting characters (not saying that the show is cliché) ,will probably make it hard for most of the people to enjoy SoniAni.

    This is literally the worst anime I&#039;ve ever seen in my life.<br />
<br />
First off, Super Sonico is an extremely boring protagonist. For someone who is a college student, model, guitarist in a band, and works at her grandma&#039;s restaurant and apparently leads an exciting life, they sure made it seem very boring. Not only that but her character and personality are one dimensional. She&#039;s perfect to the point where nothing she does or says is interesting, she just goes along with what everyone else says which is also something I had a problem with. <br />
<br />
The supporting characters don&#039;t help much either. Instead of making up for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review137431">
        what Sonico lacks, they also fall flat and are extremely uninteresting. The only interesting character in the entire series was The Manager, and that&#039;s because he reminded me a lot of Meito Anizawa (the anime shopkeeper) from Lucky Star. As far as the humor goes, whether it be subtle or apparent, it&#039;s virtually nonexistent. <br />
<br />
Don&#039;t even get me started on the music. I would have had absolutely no problem with it if Sonico didn&#039;t claim that her band played rock music. What they play and what is played throughout the entire series is a far cry from rock music. I find it an insult to actual rock music. All the ending themes and opening were very boring and unmemorable whatsoever. The ending sequences themselves also have this weird 3D animation that feels like something out of a bad Nintendo GameCube game.<br />
<br />
All in all, I don&#039;t know how I managed to go through all 12 episodes. I would only recommend this series to someone as a cruel practical joke.

    I might as well be throwing myself into the lion&#039;s den here, but there are times where one simply must ask: what exactly was anyone expecting?<br />
<br />
Super Sonico The Animation is probably exactly what you are expecting...well, that&#039;s what I was saying before it aired and saw all the reactions, at least. What was everyone else expecting? A rags-to-riches story of a three-girl band going from zero to hero? A deeply emotional and psychological show about a girl with headphones permanently glued to her head (if you look deep enough, this actually happened)? Sonico nipples?<br />
<br />
It turned out to be exactly what I was expecting, though, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review137519">
        that is: Sonico fanservice. No, not in the ecchi way (though there is some of that), in the &quot;watch Sonico do just about everything you can imagine the producers might have her do&quot; way. You know, for fans of the Nitro+ mascot, Super Sonico, and to just promote her in general. If that doesn&#039;t sound like your idea of a fun time, then I honestly don&#039;t understand why you would watch this show.<br />
<br />
But what of value does the show actually offer? Well, aside from being Sonico fanservice, it is a slice-of-life about a girl, her friends, her band, her grandma&#039;s restaurant, her modeling agency, her out-of-the-blue vacations, and her pussy...er, cats. As one might guess, it is largely episodic, though there is a certain amount of continuation with the story of the band she is in with her two friends, First Astronomical Velocity (I still think the name would be better if &quot;Velocity&quot; was changed to anything beginning with a &quot;P,&quot; but what&#039;s done is done).<br />
<br />
These episodes are largely standard in nature for an anime such as this, though it does have a few particular episodes that reach a greater height, such as the episode where Sonico mysteriously goes on an adventure, doing random things and meeting multiple people along the way. It felt like an episode out of Aria the Animation with its serene and calming atmosphere. There is also the Christmas episode, which turns out very sweet and touching. And if you are a cat lover, there is an episode in here that was made specifically for you, because you get to see cats, cat drama, cat saving, cat fighting, cat loving, cat befriending, and get cute cat feels.<br />
<br />
Does the show have more than Sonico? Well...sort of. The show does make an effort to give other characters attention, but Sonico largely takes the spotlight. Her band friends, Fuuri and Suzu, are pretty much one-trick ponies as an excessive eater and super band leader, respectively. Her manager at the modeling agency is some awkward cosplayer who is always wearing a mask and protecting Sonico from her own naivete. Sonico herself is sort of a do-everything standard moe character. Ironically, the characters who get the most development in the show are typically the ones who don&#039;t get much attention. Sonico&#039;s old mentor who gave Sonico her first guitar is a good example of this. She&#039;s barely seen, if at all, outside of flashbacks, but makes quite an impact nonetheless. In a single episode, the girl who works at the maid cafe whose name escapes me got more of a character than just about anyone else in the show ever got. The best-developed characters in the show are probably Sonico&#039;s cats, especially Cha. Cha is such a badass.<br />
<br />
One would expect the show to be pleasing to the eye, and it is...but again, if it&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for. Sonico appears in a multitude of different outfits and situations, some lewd, some tame. Animation is mostly fine, though you can tell when the budget got a bit low because of the occasional CG animated scenes, usually for the ending credits (which are new every episode and deserves a mention of its own), but also used occasionally for the band scenes.<br />
<br />
Apparently, no one knows who or what voices Supah Sonico, but it manages to be good...I guess. What really catches your ear is the music, since there is a band theme going on here. As mentioned, every credits sequence is new, and that includes a few different songs, as well, some better than others but all largely to the tastes of the kinds of people who would want to watch this kind of show in the first place. Oh, and the OP, which I looked forward to every time just for the random &quot;DESU&quot; at the end. Even if the rest of the episode sucked, I knew I had one guaranteed laugh just from that.<br />
<br />
I was once told, &quot;Don&#039;t judge a book by its cover,&quot; but when I started watching anime I realized I needed to judge these books by their covers more often than not, and this is most definitely one of those cases. I enjoyed this show, not astoundingly so, but about as much as I expected for the exact reasons I expected; just a nice, silly way to spend 20 minutes once a week, watching a girl with a future of back problems solve her present problems.

    I doubt there should be any review. <br />
<br />
This anime is down right shit, seriously , I don&#039;t uderstand why people would waste money on creating such garbage.<br />
<br />
Once I got into this anime I thought to myself , &quot; Hey , this will probably not be another K-On, Maybe it will be cool and amazingly connected to things such as friendship, band, money and maybe the songs are good AND maybe , just maybe it shows some sort of way or meaning towards why the world is so fucked up. Something like BECK.&quot; <br />
<br />
I understand some of you might be calling me an idiot at this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136525">
        time because judging from the cover it just looks like a bunch of &quot;friends&quot; who look at the world full of &quot;pink&quot; and &quot;candy&quot; and the songs are just some J-POP meaningless songs, talking about food or some shit, rather than meaningful heart touching rock songs.<br />
<br />
Well yeah , actually that&#039;s the nutshell of this show , I doubt there is anything else on it. Seriously.<br />
<br />
The characters aren&#039;t even complex , at first I saw Sonico as the sort of quiet one who&#039;s hot, Suzu as the over the top hyped one who&#039;s also hot, and Fuuri the one who likes Cute things and taking NAPS........ Who&#039;s also fucking hot and after that they didn&#039;t change at all , they just stayed the same as they were , NO change what so ever.<br />
<br />
This is literally K-On , just that everyone is as hot as Mio. THAT&#039;S IT.<br />
This anime is useless , unless you want to use it as masturbation material since it is super charged with Fan service, and since the characters are put in various situations when they just glow and look as if they were covered in... Well yeah you know what I mean. If you want a band show you should watch BECK, Or Nana, heck EVEN K-On WOULD MAKE THE CUT FOR A BAND ANIME IF IT&#039;S STANDING BESIDE THIS. Seriously, If the producers for this show  want to waste money they should waste it on a second season on BECK. <br />
<br />
As a former musician I love the guitar, I would have liked if this anime actually gave in sight into actually having struggle in playing or showing the challenges in learning how to play an instrument. Even if they did show some struggles and some cool things with the band its self,  the episodes and development of this anime would shoot that &quot;cool&quot; part of the anime down  like a kamikaze airplane in WW2. I will say though , the animation is this anime is meh , but when it want to shine it shines like a bright star, It&#039;s very fluid and the colors are used in such way that some how in every episode the characters look<br />
just as if they were about to  pop and look very 3-Dimensional  , almost as if you could touch them rather than just having animations moving on your computer screen.<br />
<br />
Anything but the animation is very bad , and just horrible , Wouldn&#039;t recommend this anime to ANYONE. Unless you want to use it for masturbation material, sure GO AHEAD , anything but that , and you will just enter an anime that you&#039;re just going to bargain in to and get less than you will get.<br />
<br />

    I&#039;m gonna disagree with all the previous reviews: this anime is not so bad. I&#039;ve seen better, but I&#039;ve seen worse ones.<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
Well, this is not the &quot;Wow, so much plot twist I din&#039;t seen that coming&quot; anime. This is nice, relaxing anime. Something you can watch if you really don´t want to think at the moment.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
Art is quite well done, and I really like the endings (my personall favourite was the one at the end of episode 10). Don&#039;t expect any super computer modeled fight scenes, but who would with music/ slice of life genre.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Yeah, it&#039;s an anime about music band, so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review138333">
        there is a lot of sound. If you like rock/pop, you&#039;ll like it. Even this is not your cup of coffee, there should be nothing to which will tear your ears.<br />
<br />
Fanservice: 6/10<br />
As this is not labeled as ecchi, don&#039;t expect any high fanservice per frame ratio. There is not nudity and most fanservice is show when Sonico is doing modelling, so you will enjoy this if you like cosplay. Also, this anime is more for big breast lovers. Just saying.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10<br />
Nothing revolutionary, nothing horrible. As I said, a nice, relaxing anime. Don&#039;t expect much and you won&#039;t  be dissapointed.<br />
<br />

    This is interesting. This is the first time I&#039;ll be really playing defense for something which most people here hate (you can argue SAO II but even that doesn&#039;t have such a low MAL score like 6.27). Nonetheless, this show deserves a little more credit than it gets. Not saying it&#039;s perfect or even all that great, heck I gave it a 7, which means it&#039;s in the decent-good range, but it&#039;s definitely not as bad as other shows with this unfortunate MAL score (like Blazblue Alter Memory which got the backlash it rightfully deserved). Now, why is that? Why is it that so few

          <span style="display: none;" id="review228295">
        people care about this show, and why is it that I am willing to stick up for it? Well, let&#039;s find out, shall we?<br />
<br />
STORY: 6/10<br />
<br />
This is an episodic series about the daily life of Super Sonico as she makes new friends while being a college student, working at her grandmother&#039;s restaurant, being a model, and being the lead guitarist of an indie band known as &quot;First Astronomical Velocity&quot;. Sure, these encounters tie back in during the final episode, but you can watch the rest of the series in any order before the finale. Sadly, some scenarios are much more tolerable than others. Episode 6 decides to make people kind of like zombies despite that that can&#039;t work in a slice of life. Episode 8 makes a tedious mystery episode that bait-&amp;-switches and wasted our time for a coincidental accident and an ending that&#039;s meant to be the final fake-out. However, other scenarios, can be either tolerable and semi-acceptable (like episodes 9 and 10) or downright heart-warming (like episodes 4, 5, and 11). First and foremost, this is the daily life of Sonico &amp; friends. What saved the whole thing was the finale they tied everything together throughout the events that took place over the course of a year. A lovely ending that made things better overall.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 6/10<br />
<br />
Sonico is adorkable. She&#039;s clumsy, horrible at waking up in the morning, and apologizes to absurd degrees. However, not only does she have a very positive personality and the drive to make things right, but she manages to juggle 3 different jobs and her college life! Sure, she gets embarrassed often, but she&#039;s definitely strong despite that. Her manager, Kitamura is a protective manager, trying to make sure that she isn&#039;t over-sexualized by her job to NSFW degrees, and in episode 3, during a show when an actor has to portray a squid harassing Sonico (the manager was as outraged by the scenario as you probably are right now), he beats the crap out of him and chased him with a sword (I won&#039;t reveal be ultimate punchline of that). Suzu is the leader of First Astronomical Velocity, and she is both a great manager and planner, and someone willing to go a bit too far in trying to sexualize Sonico for the audience. Fuuri is a loyal and cheerful member of the group, but has a fatal flaw: gluttony. Most others are very supportive and friendly people, but there are only 2 important people to talk about. Sayaka is a bitter newspaper writer and a failed book writer who has to observe Sonico for a few days, and the final conversation they have is probably try most heartwarming moment in the series. Back when Sonico was a middle-schooler, she met a girl named Kyouko Tomano, or Toma for short. She was a mysterious yet kind girl who taught Sonico how to play the guitar, and even passed down the &quot;daydream&quot; to her. Now, she makes mysterious appearances during key moments to write something related to the events for Sonico to presumable see and be happy about (it makes sense in context). Overall, the cast isn&#039;t really developed, and it takes a while to flesh some of them out a bit, but it&#039;s still a pleasant cast overall.<br />
<br />
ART: 7/10 <br />
<br />
For most part, Studio White Fox did a pretty good job with the animation department, mediocre CG aside (most of the EDs, have that 3D CGI). I especially love the eyes and how they do them. When the art needs vibrance and shine, they do that very well, like during the final concert. Otherwise, the series still looks pretty good. Too bad they use CG to pretty weak effect. Another problem is with how most of the early episodes over-sexualize Sonico, and I&#039;m not referring to the modeling scenes where that&#039;s acceptable. No, I&#039;m referring to whenever they try to shove Sonico&#039;s body down our throats during scenes, especially ones of exposition or distress. Hell, some of the later EDs try different styles, and most of them work really well, except for the terrible stuff in episode 8. If only the CG was better, or just plain replaced with more hand-drawn stuff. Well, the OP at least has some great visual flair.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 7/10<br />
<br />
Sonico&#039;s songs vary in quality, by most of them are at least decent. Most of the songs are used as EDs, with episodes 6 and 10 having some pretty great ones known as &quot;Nightmare Buster&quot; and &quot;Affection&quot; and episode 12&#039;s &quot;SuperOrbital&quot; being undoubtedly the best. The ED for episode 8 really sucks though. They can&#039;t all be winners, but at least 11/12 are decent and some of them are great. The OP is pretty decent as well. The dub is a bit mixed. Kitamura&#039;s and a few others&#039; VAs do a pretty good job, and Jessica Nigri does a pretty decent job as Sonico, and it weirdly fits despite being a lower tone than that of the original Seyuu, even if the fact that she&#039;s not too experienced is rather clear at points. Monica Rial has a wierd one as Fuuri, and I don&#039;t think it really fits. I dunno, maybe that&#039;s me. It&#039;s overall, a kinda solid dub.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 6/10<br />
<br />
I already mentioned that episodes 6 and 8 suck, so I&#039;ll get that outta the way real quick. Most of the episodes are pretty decent and make for OK entertainment. It&#039;s episodes 4, 5, 11, and 12 (plus the last part of 3) that really sell it for me despite everything with how heart-warming and satisfying they were. Episode 12 is very lovely, sentimental, and brings everything together for a satisfying and flashy finish. Hell, if episodes 6 and 8 didn&#039;t exist, and they didn&#039;t over-sexualize Sonico during the first half, I&#039;d have enjoyed the show even more. Plus, some episodes were kinda boring. Nonetheless, this was pretty serviceable.<br />
<br />
This is a very upbeat show with some heartwarming moments to it, even if it has some real sticking points. I struggle to call it nearly as bad as most others say it is, but I acknowledge that there are still problems. Basically, if you want a show about a cute girl balancing school life with rock and other stuff, and can&#039;t find K-ON anywhere, then this might be a suitable pick for you. With all that said, I bid you adieu.

    This is my first review so bare with me, also, I am relatively new to anime and have only seen a select few so my knowledge isn’t the greatest, but I will still give my opinion on this anime and decide whether or not it is worth the watch. I will say though that I came into this anime with no previous knowledge of Super Sonico so I didn’t have any expectations, and from the reviews that I had read, it didn’t look like it was going to be amazing anyway.<br />
<br />
To start off with, like most people had already said, the storyline is seriously lacking,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136711">
        there is no real story line and unlike most animes, each episode is individual from the others, there is no continuation which makes you feel like you aren’t really watching an anime, also it doesn’t give you the need to watch the next episode straight away as you don’t need to remember what happened previously, this can be taken as a positive and a negative depending on how you like to watch your anime’s. Overall, the story needs a lot of work, the storylines aren’t breath taking and they aren’t the most exciting thing ever, however I still found myself enjoying them surprisingly enough.  3/10<br />
<br />
The sound that this anime provided was okay, it wasn’t amazing nor was it terrible, I will say however that the amount of music did lack considering that this is a music/slice of life anime (Except from the last episode). The opening and ending themes were mediocre and unlike other anime’s, I probably would not have the songs on my phone, but that Is probably due to my music preference. The voices were good and matched the characters quite well, I expected cute voices and that’s what I got.    5/10<br />
<br />
This anime provided only a few main characters, so you would expect them to be developed fairly well, however most of them had little back stories and we didn’t get to understand them in that sense, the only characters that had any development was Sonico, and even this wasn’t great, you got to see how she got into the band and how she became a model, but that’s pretty much it. The supporting cast were there just for Sonico, so they really didn’t have anything unique about them, Fuuri (Drums) only really cares about food, that’s it. Suzu (Bass) had more of a personality and was quite fun to watch, especially during the Cruising of the Dead episode where you got to see her using martial arts (if you can call drop kicks martial arts). And then there’s Kitamura (the Manager) who is only seen when Sonico is on the screen, the most striking thing about him is the mask, which can be seen as funny or scary depending on the situation, he is mostly there just to support Sonico but is seen on his own when he gets drunk with others, where he lets his hair down and releases some stress. He is quite a fun character to watch especially when he tries to protect Sonico.    5/10<br />
<br />
From this anime, we got to see how someone like Sonico would live in day to day life, and the things that she got up to were relatively normal, bar the model part, compared to other anime’s it is obviously lacking in many areas, but that doesn’t mean that it wasn’t enjoyable, it is different to most anime’s that I have seen, as I tend to watch the more action orientated anime’s as it find them more interesting. To answer the question proposed at the start, I would say that the anime is worth the watch and gets a solid 6/10, it isn’t the best and it isn’t the worst. I forgot to mention the fan service in this anime, again it isn’t over the top but it is still there, mainly in her modelling shoots, it doesn’t take away from the story as there isn’t really one to begin with.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really know why i liked this anime but i did anyway, it was stupid (especially the cat episode) but i still found myself smiling, take that as you want, watch it if you like and i personally found it decent, but i can see why a lot of people rate it a 1/10.  The anime was worth the watch in my opinion and as it is only a 12 episode anime, if you don’t like it, you are not wasting many hours of your time.<br />

    When Super Sonico the Animation was on-air I didn&#039;t watch it because I though that the only thing it was going to talk about were, obvioulsy: boobs. And of course, the boobs are an important part of the anime, but now that I have watched it I realize that the anime talks about more interesting things (if possible). Leaving apart that Super Sonico is the most f*cking cute and polite girl in the world (which, from my point of view, it&#039;s the most atractive thing of the anime) she works as a model and she is not a super skinny girl like the 99.9% main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182552">
        character from other animes, which I find awesome, and when I think about being a model I always imagine that girls who think they are best than anyone... and that is so far from Sonico... she is really really humble and I love it... and I also like the passion she has with music, and how instead of just work as a model she fights for her band.<br />
She is dedicated with all the people around her and she takes care of all of them giving a hand when she can... She is so cute.<br />
So this anime is really far away from what I thought it was going to be, and it turned out to be such a beautiful anime.

    In the world of adaptation, there’s a rare breed that superficially uses the source material, before branching off into infinitely more enjoyable dalliances in creativity. The best examples are shows like Galaxy Angel and Sengoku Collection, which provide token acknowledgement of their far less interesting source material before greatly diverging into sci-fi gag comedy and movie homage, respectively. When it was announced, I suspected that SoniAni would follow the same approach, given that they decided to give a character with the personality of a grass stain her own show. And I’ll be damned if I wasn’t kind of right.<br />
<br />
The first episode does not start things

          <span style="display: none;" id="review137799">
        off well—it covers what Sonico /is/ without hinting at whether there’s actual human thought happening beneath her near-plastic exterior. She’s a model, she’s a marine biology student, she’s a server at her grandmother’s ramen joint, and she’s the guitarist in a three-piece ensemble. But as far as her personality is concerned, all that’s established is that Sonico is a reactionary, well-endowed nonentity whose identity is wholly intertwined with what she does. It creates something of a barrier to entry, but SoniAni follows up in later episodes with surprisingly smart writing that, while it doesn’t expand on her character (or lack thereof) to any significant degree, puts her in situations that her endlessly sunny disposition can easily carry her through. <br />
<br />
Of course, even if left unexplained, I think I can comfortably say that any amount of writing for SoniAni would be surprisingly strong. Hell, anything more than her being ogled by model photographers would be a step above what I expected. But it doesn’t just settle for the bare minimum of not being reprehensible, instead creating a plethora of well-executed one-off stories, accompanied by endlessly creative ED sequences. SoniAni knows the limits of its lead, and it goes to great lengths to put her in situations where her happy-go-lucky personality and propensity toward clumsiness act as catalysts for a broad array of fun, quirky plotlines that range from pseudo-murder mysteries to Sonico just wandering the countryside. The end result is thankfully rarely tedious, and the sheer variety keeps it from getting bogged down.<br />
<br />
The writing isn’t the only thing that carries SoniAni, though it is what keeps it from falling into the dregs of failed mascot promotion. There’s legitimately strong visual direction on display, the highlight of which is the aforementioned series of ED sequences, which transplants Sonico’s brand of forgettable, if pleasant pop-rock with completely unrelated scenes of surreal lunacy. One episode can end with a giant Sonico gleefully rampaging around a bustling cityscape, while another portrays her as a kitten owned by the Bill Dauterive of catmen. Even when the preceding material isn&#039;t anything to write home about, these sequences are an absolute joy to watch.<br />
<br />
SoniAni has performed the feat of making something from nothing, and can claim its rightful place near the top of the pantheon of shows that are good to have on while doing something else—and I mean that in the best possible way. It’s enjoyable and surprisingly substantial when it wants to be, using Sonico as a jumping off point for explorations of wholly unrelated characters and plotlines. It sure as hell won’t be one of the best shows of 2014, but it deserves to be acknowledged as more than heartless promotion of a girl with headphones soldered to her ears.<br />

    Before i started Super Sonico i thought this was going to be like K-On!! but replace the cute moe girls with busty, stupid girls, i was right about the stupid busty part and would like to apologize to K-On!! fans for trying to compare this to that Anime.<br />
<br />
The Anime is about Sonico, who wants to be a popular Super Model but then she also wants to be a Professional Guitarist in a band. She is shy and awkward and R-E-A-L-L-Y stupid its annoying and her breasts have the ability to defy-gravity.<br />
<br />
Her two friends in her band are Suzu Fujimi, she plays the Bass Guitar and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review164389">
        besides playing music with the band you pretty much see her drop kicking people in the face... and Fuuri Watanuki, she plays the drums, even more stupid..er.. than Sonico and thinks of nothing other than food.<br />
<br />
~This part may contain a tiny bit of spoilers~<br />
Some episodes are pretty boring to watch while like 2-3 episodes are fine to watch.<br />
The first 3-5 episodes are ether Sonico doing bikini shots in front of a camera for a few minutes or Sonico in embarrassing situations such as being forced to wear a really tiny bikini (but is saved later), wearing a retarded outfit that melts when you sweat (in front of an audience) and being assigned to be apart of some weird perverted film.<br />
<br />
Episode 10 is pointless to watch as its about Sonico getting a new cat and her other cats try to befriend that cat. 75% of dialogue in that episode is &#039;meow&#039; repeated.  If i wanted to watch something about cats i would of just searched for those stupid cute cats videos on youtube.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think this Anime is really terrible or anything i just think they could of done alot better.<br />
I&#039;ll only recommend this to people who only likes Fanservice and ...um.. yeah i guess thats all.

          As a big fan of Sonico myself, this anime is great for me. It&#039;s a relaxing slice of life story/music anime centered around our beautiful shy girl, Super Sonico. At first glance, people would think she&#039;s just a mascot with no personality just there to look pretty and provocative or simply just &quot;B00BS&quot; but that’s not the case. You get to see Sonico&#039;s character shine in this anime which is that she is a huge cat lover, loves rock, is a big nerdo, and works hard for her band, her grandmother&#039;s restaurant, and anything ! She is as sweet

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331332">
        and she is as cute. <br />
<br />
    There really isn’t much of story going on, it’s basically just Sonico chasing her dreams in music and simply enjoying the wonders of life. One episode I really enjoyed is episode 7, which is titled, Star Rain. That episode is just the definition of a peaceful Slice of Life, which Sonico travels to Niigata and we can see the nice scenery and it makes a nice aesthetic, I really enjoyed that one scene where she stops by a glassmaker&#039;s shop in the rain. <br />
<br />
    The art is pretty good, the backgrounds are well drawn, nothing &quot;meh&quot;. <br />
Although, I kind of wish the characters would look more like Tsuji Santa&#039;s art style, it does but like even more if you get me ? But anyways art isn’t bad. <br />
<br />
   Opening is really catchy and also adorable and screams out what is Super Sonico ! I sometimes listen to it as Nightcore version. lol <br />
The endings are also cute since each episode has a different montage of what happened in each episode, and also feature a different song in each one by First Astronomical Velocity. Nightmare Buster and Star Rain are my favorites. <br />
<br />
    Suzu, Fuuri, and Kitamura, are great too. First, Suzu, I like how in the anime they explain how she met Sonico and Suzu wanting Sonico to join her to see a concert together was so wholesome, so I enjoyed that very much, and she&#039;s quite the tomboy as well. Fuuri, the one who always wants nikuman, hence why I call her &quot;foodie&quot; since her name sounds like that. xD I like the concept of three-girl band so FAV is one of my favorite fictional bands, although, I wish we could&#039;ve seen more of them playing music, since I found the times when they did play music very cool. :) <br />
Kitamura, we never got to see what was under his mask, and that’s a shame. Would be interesting if that happened. xD I like how gentle and kind he is with Sonico and knows how important her band is to her and even showed up at one of her performances, that was sweet. <br />
<br />
     Also Super Pochaco, the modeling buddy of Sonico, appeared as a cameo as a background character here and there and it looks like she went from being black haired to a blondie. You can probably tell who her role model is so I’ll just keep my yap shut. Although this aside, would have been nice to hear Pochaco speak or at least have a full scene with her in it. I think it would have fit perfectly. The rest of the characters are pretty much minor so not much to say about them. So I guess that’s it for the characters. <br />
<br />
     Overall, I enjoyed this anime, so I gave it a 9/10. For me ? I even re-watched it a few times. But I don’t know if that’s just me being a fangirl or not. Lol <br />
<br />
Would I recommend it ? <br />
If you like music anime or a nice slice of life, I recommend this or of you are simply a Sonico fan like me, then GO WATCH IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR !? Also Season 2, when ? <br />

    Super Sonico is an interesting attempt at bringing some life to Nitroplus&#039; mascot. For once, we find main characters that are beyond high school age (just barely), but does the show hold up on its own? As a relative outsider with bare-minimum exposure to the franchise, I have to say no. Super Sonico is simply a slice of life about a girl who goes out of her way to help others and happens to really like music. If you&#039;re looking for a show that has any semblance of plot progression or character development, I&#039;d look elsewhere- this is purely fluff with the entertainment value coming

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204880">
        primarily from the vaguely ecchi body proportions and costumes of the heroines.<br />
<br />
[b]Animation:[/b]<br />
The animation style is pretty up to date with good colorization and decent backgrounds; there are surprisingly many different settings in this show. While not particularly special in any way, the animation comes off as pleasant overall. The only main exception is the excessive CGI used in the ED sequences and some of the band performances. Super Sonico herself is rather interesting in that she has permanent earphones- they come off neither when she bathes nor when she sleeps, which might explain why half a dozen screeching alarms don&#039;t wake her up. Though the main gals are college aged, don&#039;t expect them to behave much more mature than your standard high-school aged protagonist. The manager is also an interesting character who is often mistaken for a Kabuki actor given his appearance. An effort has obviously been made to make the heroines look cute, almost but not quite to K-on levels. That being said, there isn&#039;t any drama or events that merit a need for a wide range of facial expressions.<br />
<br />
There is a tad of light action, mostly from Suzu practicing pseudo-wrestling moves and double kicks on random people. There is light ecchi overall though no significant harm comes to Sonico given her manager&#039;s protective nature, and willingness to use a katana on those who ask more than they should of the overly-considerate Sonico.<br />
<br />
[b]Sound:[/b]<br />
There is a lot of singing in this show, whether it is the main OP, multitude of EDs, or plethora of insert songs. The heavily electro-infused OP is energetic but lacks a well defined melody. I tried through some of the EDs but didn&#039;t find anything particularly good either. Overall, the vocal performances were average, perhaps just a bit too much of Sonico&#039;s voice. The BGM, on the other hand, is actually above average and has some good themes that are repeated and eventually become familiar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wa wa wa&quot; is probably the main thing I&#039;ll take away from this show, you&#039;ll hear Sonico use the phrase repeatedly. Though the VA performance was sufficient, I felt the show lacked a standout character. <br />
<br />
[b]Story:[/b]<br />
The show follows Sonico as she goes to school, helps her grandmother out as a waitress, goes to college and excels at her studies despite us never seeing her study, and practices/performs with her band mates. Along the way Sonico will be attacked on a cruise ship, get lost in the middle of nowhere, and end up collapsed in the midst of a mystery among other episodic plots. There isn&#039;t much holding the show together plot wise other than a final band performance watched by all the minor supporting characters that we met along the way. Though the general slice of life is okay, there isn&#039;t really any tension or anything particularly interesting; if you&#039;re watching this, I&#039;d do so on a very casual basis.<br />
<br />
[b]Character:[/b]<br />
Likewise, though the main heroines have semblances of personality (though Fuuri is a bit on the questionable side) you don&#039;t get to learn much about the characters&#039; histories or desires. It&#039;s more about just having a good time than exploring character relationships. Some of the characters, such as Sonico&#039;s agency&#039;s other model Ouka, seem completely random and take up screen time for no real good reason. There are also way too many supporting characters for a show that doesn&#039;t go anywhere. Sonico&#039;s grandmother is probably the most interesting of all the characters, as she actually has some history and shows off some crazy skills in multiple ways.<br />
<br />
[b]Value:[/b]<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a show with depth or intrigue, this is not it. It&#039;s a simple slice of life with a plot that goes nowhere and an extra dosage of supporting characters and cats. It morphs between a mystery, adventure, and girl band show but ultimately comes out feeling hollow. I&#039;d skip unless you are desperately in search of a 2D waifu.

    Before sitting down to watch this series, I can&#039;t say that I really knew Sonico as a character. Based on her design and the numerous crossovers that she cosplayed, from other franchises (see the insane amount of merchandise that has been sold with her likeness), I used to think that she was just an &quot;oppai&quot; character — whose only gimmick is that a) she has pink-hair and headphones, and b) is very voluptuous. After watching the adaptation of the visual novel&#039;s story, I learned that I was completely wrong about her!<br />
<br />
⚠️ This review will be spoiler-free ⚠️<br />
<br />
—Story/Characters<br />
<br />
The series starts off with Sonico going to a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363096">
        sultry photo shoot, not only that, but one of her best friends (Suzu) constantly wants to dress her up in lewd outfits. When this series was first airing, six years ago, I originally dropped it because it seemed too exploitative for my tastes. I really don&#039;t like the angle of an employer, taking advantage of an employee (what basically happened with Sonico and a bunch of middle-aged photographers). I also knew Nitroplus as a company, and they are mostly known for erogē games, so there was that, too! <br />
<br />
This year, I decided to pick up the series again, because Sonico is such a famous and visually iconic character. I wanted to know about the super-star &quot;bishōjo,&quot; who had accumulated such a profound amount of love and adoration from the &quot;ecchi&quot; otaku fandom. Aside from the occasional salacious snapshot of Sonico, her character is actually written to be very admirable. She&#039;s a hard-working (and talented) girl, that juggles college, being a model, working at her grandma&#039;s restaurant, and being in a band. Sonico is portrayed as being very pure-hearted and lucid, too, so she never has qualms with helping other people out, or occasionally rescuing a lost kitten.<br />
<br />
At first, I was wary about her manager. I was worried that he would act lecherous towards Sonico, too, (especially, because he wears an &quot;oni&quot; mask all of the time), but he&#039;s really a good guy. He just wants to the best for Sonico and he wants people to be able to get to know her, so that bad rumors aren&#039;t spread and she can have a chance to shine... with her inner and outer beauty! Naturally, Sonico is very naïve, so her manager always tags along, to make sure that no one creeps on her. Episode 3: &quot;Sonico Goes to Okinawa&quot; and Episode 5: &quot;New World&quot; are particularly hear-warming episodes, expressing the manager&#039;s deep care for her.<br />
<br />
The older characters are written with more respect than I usually find with adult characters in anime. There&#039;s a kind-hearted journalist lady, who&#039;s going through a mid-life crisis, and Sonico&#039;s grandma (a.k.a. dark horse best girl, Sonico&#039;s granny is a guitar goddess and was really pretty, when she was a young starlet)!<br />
<br />
The weakest link in the plot are Sonico&#039;s bandmates, Suzu and Fūri pale in her presence, when they&#039;re compared to Sonico. I guess she&#039;s the title character for a reason, but I feel like her two friends could have been a little bit more memorable and/or likable. Suzu is the dark-haired, smart one that lusts after Sonico, so basically... a lesbian version of Rei Hino from Sailor Moon, and Fūri just eats all of the time.<br />

Luna&#039;s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅<br />
<br />
Kenichi Kawamura (director), notable works:<br />
* Qualidea Code<br />
* Steins;Gate 0 ✅<br />
<br />
Commentary: I have only seen Mr. Kawamura&#039;s work on Steins;Gate 0 and I really enjoyed the sequel series! Great work! There are some really fluid sakuga scenes in this series, and the character designs look good with the style of animation!<br />
<br />
I watched SoniAni: Super Sonico The Animation with the English dub, so I will list the Japanese seiyū, but comments will be on the performances of the English voice actors.<br />
<br />
Ayano Yamamoto as Super Sonico, notable roles:<br />
* Nazuna Tennōzu, Change Our Mirai!!<br />
* Emma, Honto ni Atta! Reibai Sensei<br />
* Nukko, Nukko.<br />
* Shiki, Senran Kagura ✅<br />
* Nae Tennōji, Steins;Gate ✅<br />
* Ōpa Cognitive Computing System, Steins;Gate: Sōmei Eichi no Cognitive Computing<br />
<br />
Jessica Nigri as Super Sonico, notable roles:<br />
* None<br />
<br />
Commentary: Jessica Nigri is mostly known as an internet personality and cosplayer. This is the only role she&#039;s ever had in an anime and I have to say, she did a really good job on it! Ms. Nigri was able to capture Sonico&#039;s awkwardness and social anxiety really well. Especially for a first role, I think that Ms. Nigri knew Sonico&#039;s character really well (she was a big fan of her before the recording of the dub) and it shines through, in her performance of the character! <br />

Commentary: The same predicament that I had with Luci Christian&#039;s role applies here. Ms. Rial is very talented. I used to be really into the series, Kiddy Grade. And, when I was younger, I loved her as Lumière! So, one of my friends got to meet her at an anime convention, so, she brought me back an autographed poster. Ms. Rial is typically good at playing youthful-sounding characters, with a nasally inflection!<br />
<br />
From the start, I should have known that I would end up liking the Super Sonico series. Every visual novel that I&#039;ve played under their moniker, has turned out to have a really well thought-out plot and purpose (excluding the BL-branch, &quot;Nitro+chiral,&quot; all of their translated games have been terrible and grotesque). Sonico&#039;s beautiful, clear-minded ambition is really inspiring. Whether she is hard at work, or listless on a vacation, the character has a refined charm—like Tanjirō Kamado from Kimetsu no Yaiba, her heart is as clean as a mountainous stream! I give SoniAni: Super Sonico The Animation a 5/10!<br />
<br />

    Sometimes boring.  Sometimes skeezy.  Sometimes stupid.  A lot of terrible jokes.  I enjoyed myself.<br />
<br />
I like to watch trashy anime, and this series was perfect to chill out to before bed.  I would smile and shake my head and say, &quot;Ahh that crazy Sonico, her life is one big barrel of monkeys alright!&quot; and then roll over and fall asleep.<br />
If you know the titular character, you can easily guess what this series is going to be.  The best aspect of the series is how Sonico can and does make friends with anybody she meets, and I was always made so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review161681">
        very content by it.  Essentially if you do not think the characters are even slightly endearing, you won&#039;t be able to watch with the same sense of bemusement I enjoyed it with.<br />
Episode 7 was the standout of the series for me, in which Sonico wanders the countryside taking photos and meeting people.  It would be absurd to compare it to Ghibli or Mushishi, but hey, I felt the same level of placid contentedness here so that counts for something.<br />
<br />
Super Sonico the Animation has earned a forgiving 5 from me based entirely on my attitude while watching an otherwise kind of bad series.

    This is my first review so....sorry if its bad.<br />
<br />
One day i was browsing crunchyroll and I happen to stumble on this anime. One thing I noticed about this anime was that you really don&#039;t have to think about the story (if there even is one). In my opine this anime was made to be a fan service based anime. Now I have nothing wrong with a little fan service because I highly enjoyed No Game No Life. But feel like Super Sonico anime was just made to be a fan sevice anime with really not that much story.<br />
<br />
One thing I do like about this anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review237429">
        is the art. It is just so clean and lively. And the characters where  believable.<br />
<br />
Over all I would enjoyed it a little more if it maybe had a little more story to it and had some character development.  <br />
<br />
thank you for reading my review!

    This anime is meant for fun, nothing else. You can watch an episode without watching previous episodes, or knowing previous lore. This anime is just for the fun of watching Sonico is her daily life. It is an awesome anime to watch if you don&#039;t want a heartfelt romance, or comedy. Each episode is fun, fresh and exciting to watch, even if you marathon them all. <br />
Overall it is good, the story is usually very innocent, the art is wonderful, the sound is what you expect from a music based anime, the characters, though bland, are awesome in their own sense, and the enjoyment is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review227483">
        an incredible 9/10 for me. I had fun watching this, and I recommend watching it if you do not want commitment, or want to follow each episode to find out what happens. <br />
I watch many romantic comedies, and this is an anime that helped me feel better after watching the final 2 episodes of Haganai Next. <br />
I wish to see more of this fun anime, and hope people enjoy it as much as I did.
