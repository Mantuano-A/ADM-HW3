    Owarimonogatari season 2 is the conclusion, final chapter, to the main storyline presented since Bakemonogatari in 2009. And to say that it was a long time coming would be an understatement. It has been nearly a decade since I fell in love with this anime. While it has had its ups and downs it never became intolerable. For anyone who kept watching this series for this long or joined the train, enjoy the finale. <br />

Mayoi Hell and Hitagi Rendevous are arcs with essential information that is needed to be build up before reaching the final boss. The final boss known as Ougi has been foreshadowed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255276">
        for some time now. Who is she? Where did she come from? We will have the answers to all our questions in this arc. All the pieces that have been lingering will finally connect. <br />
<br />
Mayoi Hell consists of Ararargi going to hell after being intentionally killed by Gaen. If you haven&#039;t watched Koyominonogatari by now you should go back because it is very necessary. As well as obviously watching the rest of the series that has aired beforehand. Visually it is an extremely fun episode and seeing Ararargi and Mayoi banter after all these years is great. We saw them send each other off in the Second Season in a touching moment and in the Final Season, we see the wonderful reunion. The music that accompanies the touching moment towards the end pulls at your heartstrings. Can you call it manipulative? Sure but it sure has hell worked well. The comedic timing can be abrasive and I say this in a positive way. It&#039;s an onslaught of comedy smacking in your face with animation shifting from cartoony back to on model. With sprinkles of deep dialogue, we get a traditional Monogatari script. The most important element of the arc is Ararargi showing his attitude towards life changing but his heart remains the same. He will always want to save people even if he went back and did things again. However, he still shows some regret in the approach he took and how he could have improved on it. Anyone who has been interested in Ararararararagi&#039;s character development will be satisfied seeing him converse with Mayoi. In the second half of the arc, we are met with a character that was first introduced in Tsukimonogatari. To not get spoilers they converse about why Ararargi had to die and come back to life. This arc truly benefitted from the TV Special format because they were a ton of different settings being presented as Mayoi and Ararargi take a journey to meet the man who will bring him back to life. The animation quality was astonishing far better than what we saw in Owarimonogatari season 1. <br />
<br />
Hitagi Rendevouz isn&#039;t just a filler date between our main cast and heroine. While Hitagi takes a large chunk of her self-proclaimed arc, Ougi Oshino interrupts to speak about the important implications that were presented in Mayoi Hell. Ougi&#039;s near threatening dialogue and the sound design gives me chills down my spine when hearing her speak to Ararargi. Without having any knowledge of the next arc, Ougi Dark, you feel anxiety throughout. But wait wait wait let&#039;s get back to the date between our main girl and main boy. Hitagi probably looks the most beautiful here than in any other series. While this is obviously a personal feeling I had to put it in the ethersphere. But being beautiful isn&#039;t just about the character design, shaft really kept up with the animation and kept her on model almost throughout. With the obvious exception of comedic animation shifts. The backgrounds are rich and full of life as Hitagi, with her new driving license, takes out Ararargi on a date. The date itself was very charming. The most befitting to a 6 months relationship. To the viewers, it has been 8 years. <br />
<br />
Ougi Oshino is Ougi Oshino <br />
<br />
What makes this arc very different than most arcs is that it is a bit mature, not as mature as Hanamonogatari was but close. We don&#039;t see much fan service and we see a lot of reflection of the past. Its a somber ending. I am glad we are at the conclusion. But do not fret there are more novels to be adapted which will be. While they might not hit as hard as these arcs in this season it will still be a joy to watch. <br />
<br />
Thank you for the best 8 years of my life Nisio and SHAFT.

This review does not contain spoilers. This review is not made by a blind fanatic or a hater who has nothing better to do, this review is made by a person who saw this series for more than 8 years of his life.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll be honest and I&#039;ll go straight to the point. I will not speak with fanaticism in my words, I will write just the truth about these episodes, my truth, nothing more and nothing less. I have no sweet words to these episodes, so if you can&#039;t digest a different opinion

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255561">
        than yours I ask you to not continue reading my review.<br />
<br />
I want to clarify this before I start, I&#039;m a fan of this series since the day it was released in 2009 and the second season is in my top ten favorite anime of all the time, so you wonder why I did not like this part? and the answer is very simple, I do not like this part because it concentrates everything that is wrong with the last works of the Monogatari series by the acclaimed Japanese animation studio shaft and directed by Akiyuki Shinbou, oh wait a moment is not even him who directed these episodes, that makes so much sense and at the same time so little, Shinbou why do you disappear when the fans of the old times need you more than ever? oh, I see you&#039;re a captain who does not sink with the ship, intelligent move on your part, traidor. <br />
<br />
One of the clearest problems is the speed with which the story advances, being so fast does not create a sense of importance in the events that occur in the story, at one point we are with a scene that pretends to be emotional and full of stress and the next moment the protagonist is making jokes about the underwear of a minor and you can tell me that that always happened with the Monogatari series but this time it is in a more clumsy, notorious and completely out of place way. <br />
<br />
It is really depressing and insulting for a lifelong fan to see that the mistakes of the past have not been corrected and not only that, but that the problem has been aggravated in such a stupid way that you can not do anything more than pretend that you did not see anything. I was the best accomplice of this series and I did not give importance in the past but I got bored of the same grotesque joke again and again, which leads us to the following problem with these episodes, which is the repetition of the same old material, these episodes only repeats the same jokes and ideas that in previous seasons, these episodes did not innovate at all and you know what is worse than that? is that the people behind this work does not even try or care about the fact that they are just recycling the old stuff over and over again, they are hitting your head over and over again with the same old ideas and jokes until you say enough and I&#039;m a fan who got tired of this deal, it is no longer funny, it is not innovative anymore, it is not even artistically pleasing as it was before. It&#039;s just an endless number of memes that died a long time ago. They pretend to be funny when it&#039;s just a lot of trash that they&#039;re recycling to not create anything new. Why strive to create something new if the old is accepted as something with some value. <br />
<br />
These episodes suffer from not giving much explanation to some important events that occur in the life of the characters, how convenient is to not explain anything and just move forward as if this were a race but the production team can take the time to do the same joke again and again, so it is not a problem of time, they simply do not care in the desire of the fans, &quot;give us your money and go away&quot;. Also includes many characters that are only present for a brief and insignificant moment, this is an insult to the characters themselves and fans of these characters, an absolute disgrace. In other occasions the characters act as if they were a stereotype of some very obvious program and they make clear what are their intentions although the series wants to generate an atmosphere of mystery, but is not a mystery if you are telling me everything directly or at least is not a good mystery.<br />
<br />
These episodes are the clear sign that studio shaft loves to play safe and just want the easy money of the fans who are hungry for more material, for more empty dialogues and characters pretending to be talking about something deep when it&#039;s just about the panties of a little girl. The fans are many, they will eat whatever it is, they must create something that many will like, easy to eat and bring it to their tables as fast as possible and the result is a hamburger. this is a hamburger that instead of having interesting dialogues full of new ideas is full of the greed of the people who are in the production studio, instead of having witty and provocative comedy has jokes about the tits of a little girl and instead of taking the time to develop the characters and be careful with their emotions has recycled material fresh from the trash. <br />
<br />
I firmly refuse to accept this insult to my loyalty for this franchise, I refuse with all my love to accept this mistreatment of my patience and I refuse with all my passion to remain silent, these episodes were the worst I saw in the whole series and it&#039;s sad that everything has ended in this mediocre way. Each movement of the characters was predictable, each word was said in the past and every joke was repeated so many times that it is no longer funny. <br />
<br />
Sweet dreams my beautiful monogatari series, you are no longer what you once knew to be. I have admired you for over 8 years, I laughed with your first jokes and I identify with some of your characters but after more than 68 episodes, 3 movies, 2 ovas, you&#039;re not longer what you used to be.<br />
<br />
I do not need buzzword like say &quot;masterpiece&quot; every 4 words to describe my feelings, I just let the heart speak and this review was made with heart and passion so I hope you understand that I do not hate this series at all, I just wish everything was better... Every moment, every word, every plot change in the story did not live up to expectation and the name of these series.<br />
<br />
Rest in peace. <br />
<br />
From a real fan who was waiting for this moment for more than 8 years.

    Before the review this is my personal opinion: I am so glad that this series didn’t disappoint me at all and I had such a great time watching it . Monogatari will always be one of the best anime I saw and I genuinely love it with all  my heart starting with the great characters and ending with the lessons told from each series. <br />
<br />
This is the final puzzle piece from the Monogatari series. In this series every little detail from the other series that were left unexplained was revealed to its audience. Another worth praising writing style from the author who knows damn

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255340">
        well how to leave intentionally plot holes who are gonna be filled later in his future works. This is why the flaws are what makes Monogatari a great piece from the storytelling medium.<br />
<br />
Once again Shaft managed to use the visuals in perfect harmony with the current action of the characters and dialogue lines to emphasis the message for its audience. As an example I will mention  the fantastic and beautiful association of each character from monogatari with a star constellation during Ougi’s explications .The dialogue is well used for the characterization and plot helping with the progression of the story.<br />
<br />
As we all know the minor characters from Monogatari are so well used for the plot and characterization of the main characters and in this series doesn’t disappoint us at all . Who taught that Tadatsuru a minor character from Tsukimonogatari would had such a impact across the story in Owari 2. Let’s not forget Oshino Meme disappearance after Bake which had a purpose after all and finally Gaen who is the shining star from Owari 2 using again her brilliant mind to solve a problem. Fantastic!<br />
<br />
Owari 2 also manages to give screen time to the two main characters from Bake Senjougahara and Araragi. It’s always a pleasure to see Senjougahara verbal abusing Araragi but caring for him deep down in her heart proving once again why her actions are unpredictable and her personality unique. What I am trying to say is that in this series we finally see the choices that those decided to take as a couple for their future after their long fight with their own problems.<br />
<br />
One of the main themes that needs to be mentioned is about change,  portrayed through the actions and choices Araragi goes through . As for each part from Owari 2 they each have a different plot and message  but they are all connected to the main story from Owari 2.Mayoi Hell is the preparation stage for Ougi Dark and Hitagi Rendevouz is the bridge that connects them . In Ougi Dark  everything comes together giving a conclusion to the Monogatari series and presenting how the actions and choices the characters made influenced their lives .<br />
<br />
Trust me you will not regret any moment by watching Owari 2 , you will experience  a lot of emotions through each arc and the conclusion will leave you in tears of joy and sadness.<br />
This series managed to give a conclusion to all of the other series from Monogatari and answer all the left questions. <br />

Owarimonogatari was ultimately the end of the first, and most likely the main story of the series. These last three arcs provided a good conclusion and I wouldn&#039;t be upset if that&#039;s the final Monogatari-related product adapted by SHAFT. Although I doubt it, since there are tens of side-stories, epilogues, prologues and everything in-between left to adapt. This, however, felt like a proper conclusion. Even if it wasn&#039;t what I wanted, I can&#039;t help but feel happy about the ending regardless. <br />
<br />
Monogatari, ever since I began watching it, always left me with an air of ambivalence. If you go venture forth to the past and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255380">
        dig through to find one of my earliest reviews on this website, one of Bakemonogatari, you&#039;d see exactly that. Me struggling endlessly with coming to terms with my feelings about the series. It left me feeling sleazy and gross, but compelled and intrigued. I initially described it as the guiltiest possible pleasure and while my opinions may have changed with my tastes, I think that outlines the overall complexity of emotions I felt towards the product. On one hand the presentation is outstanding and unique, hearkening back and taking from the French New Wave, but what its presenting is often perverse and over-indulgent. The main narrative is fractured and presented in a spectacularly interesting fashion with the unreliable narrator quirk, but is often sidelined for pandering sexuality. The characters are multi-faceted and endlessly dynamic, but aren&#039;t often presented as such. It is an enigma, truly. <br />
<br />
While my opinions have changed and my appreciation for this series continuously grows, due to the amount of inspiration it has given me as a creative, this idea of conflicting feelings still remains the same. Even throughout this end-story. I get a conclusion, and the conclusion is quite good with just about every story wrapping up in a feel-good bundle of catharsis. It is still something that I wasn&#039;t expecting nor really wanting from this show. I was expecting something darker, something more somber, something with pain and eventual sacrifice and I was expecting the specialists to play significantly bigger role in the story after their buildup through Owarimonogatari&#039;s first season as well as the awe-inspiring conclusion to Koyomimonogatari. <br />
<br />
Maybe my expectations weren&#039;t deserved and built completely upon my own desires for the series, but that feels redundant to say as that&#039;s pretty much defining expectations for anything. Owarimonogatari&#039;s second season and conclusion does have problems, however, it is packaged and delivered so well that they don&#039;t feel like problems as much as they feel like additions that I may disagree with. Maybe that&#039;s why i&#039;m so happy to accept this conclusion even if it harshly isn&#039;t what I wanted or expected, that&#039;s my mea culpa. <br />

[Presentation] <br />
<br />
Before we delve deep into the semi-spoiler conversation, I think it is safe to say that this series is the best presented television anime. While it may not be as beautifully animated as something from Kyoto Animation or as viciously energetic as a Trigger production, it is a SHAFT product through and through. Harsh yet understated, with pronounced colors and a focus on bringing the most from dialogue heavy scenes. <br />
<br />
The coloring in these episodes is as good as ever, with beautiful shot-composition mixed in with spectacular changes in art-style in the first arc of this series. The other two were equally beautiful, with harsh changes of color and space, presenting even the goofiest character moments as if it is high-art strung up in a gallery. <br />
<br />
The violent, stinging violins in the climactic soundtrack continuously impress. While most people may point to the admittedly catchy opening themes of this series as examples of its musical prowess, I can&#039;t help but point to what I find more impressive. The memorable backing tracks to the shows most climactic moments. From the badass theme at the end of Nisemonogatari, where specialist Kagenui flexes her muscles in a scene so brutally cathartic that it is one of my all-time favorite anime moments. To the plucking strings and winding synths of the shows most surprising scenes, when Gaen reveals her vampire-slaying sword and chops our protagonist into a thousand pieces. The music here is as wonderful as ever. <br />
<br />
Monogatari has never been the most animated series, and for good reason. Much like most TV-anime it is a rushed product on a deadline. However, SHAFT make even the most still scenes feel alive and vibrant with the setting and shot composition, and as always the direction here is astounding. <br />
<br />

[Story and Resolution] <br />
<br />
<br />
Presented in three arcs, the final moments with these characters and their eventual graduation feel spur-of-the-moment. The show, for the first time ever, feels as though it has a distinct narrative purpose. Since it has one goal, to end its main story, it never decides to linger on moments that are otherwise unimportant to the series narrative. Even the second episode, the extended date between Senjougahara and Araragi feels as though it plays a direct part in the climax, Araragi&#039;s waning adolescence, Ougi&#039;s mysterious plot, and the growth between these two from a relationship standpoint. <br />
<br />
However, before we delve into that, we have the first story. Between Araragi, Hachikuji, and the involved Tadatsuru, which delivers something visually astounding and narratively intriguing, yet creates a few worries that may find themselves wriggling into the shows core climax.  <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
[Mayoi Hell] <br />
<br />
Obvious spoilers. Hachikuji is back and she&#039;s in hell. Some pretty funny reasoning is provided for that. More importantly, SHAFT gets to flex its visual style to the fullest here, providing one of the most visually impressive arcs since the gorgeous Tsukimonogatari. As Araragi ventures through hell, and to a certain extent, his past, he discovers how to return and what the reasoning behind his murder was. An elaborate plan by Gaen to return his humanity. <br />
<br />
Good stuff. Even if Hachikuji&#039;s return wasn&#039;t all that interesting to me. Especially since we have already said our goodbyes to that character and coming back after a pretty good send-off feels as though i&#039;m holding in a sneeze. Unrewarding and kind of painful. I like Hachikuji, she&#039;s quirky and engaging with a pretty great catchphrase that gets probably the best payoff of any joke in the series. However, I couldn&#039;t help but feel disappointed in her return as an establishment of norms and the lack of consequences. It robbed the series of some weight. More on her later. <br />
<br />
They meet with Tadatsuru and in beloved Monogatari fashion we get a gloriously long exposition sequence full of fascinating insights by this really intriguing character, as well as a quick look at the network of specialists that Gaen has established as being the backbone for oddity-hunting. Tadatsuru&#039;s powers are great and paint a understandable picture of Ononoki&#039;s creation, even if we lack the insight of her &quot;big sister&quot;, Kagenui, more on her later. <br />
<br />
Araragi is sent off with Hachikuji captured in his legs and brings her into the real world. Initially I had even more of an objection to this, as it totally undermined her exit even further. If it is so easy to leave hell, what is even the point of it? However, that gets amended further on in the series. The introductory arc here really set the tone for the show. It was lean-mean, and without filler, which was great. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[Hitagi Rendezvous] <br />
<br />
Before I even talk about the date, I want to express how deeply upsetting it was to see Kagenui&#039;s character and her potentially incredible importance to the series being brushed off. It undermined the entirety of her disappearance in Koyomimonogatari as well as never quite explaining how Ougi got anyone to leave. It felt like an underhanded and obnoxiously pandering way to just keep Ononoki around the harem, which honestly doesn&#039;t fucking matter to me. Ononoki is pretty much useless right now, she is literally a doll and since Kagenui isn&#039;t around, has virtually no power. She is there to provide a few sparring dialogue driven moments and her inclusion in this arc felt completely unnecessary as she virtually did nothing. <br />
<br />
If they kept Kagenui relevant to the story and didn&#039;t chuck her to the side for literally no convincing reason, Ononoki and Kagenui could&#039;ve been back to actually matter and provide some interesting insight to spar with Gaen&#039;s own bias arguments against Ougi. Yet nothing like that happened. She&#039;s gone, and the reasoning given was that she was practicing &quot;Martial arts&quot; at what was later revealed to be the North Pole. Why? Why would she be doing that? Isn&#039;t she an immortal oddity specialist? Isn&#039;t her goal and job to exterminate immortal oddities? Isn&#039;t Shinobu back in her full-form? Isn&#039;t that Ougi? Kagenui expressed no fear in fighting Shinobu with her powers back in Nise, so it makes no sense for her to leave now. Way to completely under-utilize a dynamic and potentially interesting character. What a farce. This was probably the most upsetting moment about this three-parter and probably the only reason I had to take a point off. <br />
<br />
Especially since the date between Araragi and Senjougahara was wonderful. I always felt as though their relationship was a bit tepid. They said they damn-near love each other yet Araragi runs around fucking with plenty of other girls. It really doesn&#039;t make any sense and makes the entire relationship feel phony, especially since Senjougahara got almost no screen-time recently. Her return is welcome. She is the most dynamic and fascinating of the harem-girls and definitely proved that here. Her character growth since the first arc in Bakemonogatari is palpable and honestly very endearing. Her various little idiosyncrasies really paint an engaging portrait of her character. <br />
<br />
The resolution to their date is endlessly lovable and actually helps create a more believable relationship between the two, even if I still object to Araragi&#039;s lascivious and scummy behavior otherwise. I really enjoyed this, and I didn&#039;t find that it meandered or lacked any meaning. It was well-placed in the middle of these other two, more serious arcs. <br />
<br />
What i&#039;d be remiss not to discuss is the dream sequence with Ougi, which is not only a spectacular insight on her character but also plays as a wonderful hint at who she really is. Everything from her saying being a riff on Gaen and Hanekawa to her knowledge of the star-systems being Araragi&#039;s own knowledge, the pieces of the puzzle were finally falling into place and this fractured narrative was finally become clear. At this point, in my eyes, it was clear with who Ougi was, even if I wasn&#039;t sure what role she exactly played. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[Ougi Dark]<br />
<br />
To refer back to my initial thesis, this arc&#039;s progress and climax wasn&#039;t something I was expecting or wanting, but a great part about growing up is being able to look at something as a whole and really determining whether that is a bad thing. I think the more I look back on this arc the more I&#039;ll come to enjoy and appreciate that it did something that I wasn&#039;t expecting nor wanting, but still managed to be entertaining and pretty damn impressive, narratively. <br />
<br />
My fear that the specialists would ultimately play a small role in the climax was unfortunately confirmed, as Gaen dumped some exposition and moved on. This and Shinobu&#039;s ultimate uselessness in her hyper-powerful form needs to be accepted as a narrative loop rather than a flaw, in my opinion. Because of course Araragi will ultimately have to face this issue on his own. It is, after all, always been his issue and no one else&#039;s. The narrative here had me hurdling through various flaming hoops of acceptance while also trying to follow along to the somewhat complicated explanations for everything. Needless to say, it was a gripping experience none-the-less.<br />
<br />
What particularly impressed me apart from Ougi&#039;s true reveal was the use for Hachikuji who&#039;s inclusion I have previously expressed my distaste with. Gaen&#039;s proposed solution was actually quite clever and made sense within the grand scheme of the story and provided the best use of Hachikuji&#039;s signature &#039;I stuttered&quot; catchphrase. It was great. I went from disliking her inclusion to totally buying it, which speaks volumes to how well this entire aspect of the narrative was delivered. <br />
<br />
Onward to Ougi&#039;s true reveal. I say &quot;true&quot; because her being Araragi&#039;s oddity didn&#039;t come as much of a surprise, of course she was. Especially the opening to this final arc solidifying that. What was more interesting a reveal was her role as Araragi&#039;s oddity, manifesting as adolescence. This actually paints a unique picture of Araragi&#039;s character and growth throughout the series. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m no stranger to criticizing our boy Koyomi here, since I think he&#039;s kind of a scumbag, however, the portrait of his adolescence was poignant none-the-less. This somewhat esoteric conclusion helped me understand the rest of this series&#039; motivations as well as his character progression overall. What could&#039;ve been myopic ended up being quite engaging, even Araragi&#039;s rejection of his own change to saving Ougi, which I was initially against but over the course of the past few hours warmed up to. Because of course he&#039;d save her, he&#039;s Araragi. <br />
<br />

[The Moral of the Story]<br />
<br />
<br />
And now for the epilogue, or rather, the punchline. What Monogatari does so well is provide an experience unlike anything else in anime. An industry and medium that indulges in pulpy entertainment has this series which indulges in the idea of indulging. Consuming everything that is inherently right or wrong with the industry and presenting it as if it is high-art. Taking ideas from the most influential, yet also the most cherry-picked movement in cinema, the French New Wave, and crafting a narrative that not only doesn&#039;t treat its audience like children, but goes out of its way to be esoteric and challenging. Very much in line with the New Wave, Monogatari has a kind of style and essence to it that separates it from anything else in the medium. Especially since at its core it has these sleazy elements to it. <br />
<br />
Relating back to the initial point of contention, my dissonance with this series manifesting as a love and appreciation for it. These last three arcs, ones which lack the fanservice that some of the other parts of the series indulge in, are some of the most solid parts of the series, up there with the flawless masterpiece which is Hitagi End, my favorite thing I&#039;ve ever seen from this televised medium. It proves to me that this show could&#039;ve been better without its over-indulgent obsession with childish sexuality and pandering which often took up big parts of other episodes in other arcs, however, is that really true? I undoubtedly didn&#039;t, and don&#039;t, enjoy those elements, yet they are inherent in Monogatari being Monogatari. Without them this wouldn&#039;t be Monogatari, and the lack of them in these final arcs proves to me how big of contrast there is, which helped elevate the stakes and create tension which otherwise wouldn&#039;t have been escalated if the entire series was devoid of these elements.<br />
<br />
I feel like I always wanted Monogatari to be more mature than it was, however, once again, maybe that was wishful thinking. Much like Araragi says as the final line in these arcs, he is himself, and this series is itself. And expecting it to be something different when it so well-established exactly what it is makes no sense, logistically. Because much like Araragi, Monogatari experienced an odd kind of growth as well, where the maturity may not have increased but a realization did happen. The self-awareness here is palpable and as with any product that has displayed a knack for multi-faceted storytelling, I don&#039;t think it is out-of-line to analyze this series so extensively. <br />
<br />
During Ougi Dark, there is a scene where the characters dissect Ougi&#039;s formation as a cake. Each character representing a slice. Which honestly feels like this show being self-aware about its own indulgence, both having the cake and eating it to, which is an element I&#039;ve been bringing up in reviews since their conception. The cake here being Araragi&#039;s division and eventual realization of purpose, while also doubling as context for this shows harem elements. Which I wouldn&#039;t say is as much of an excuse as it is a justification, and a good one at that. <br />
<br />
Its harem elements were never the strongest parts of the series, and being myself I&#039;d go so far as to say they were the weakest parts. However, they, in the end, felt necessary to this show having the conclusion it did. For me, the strongest parts were always the main narrative and the specialists, who were characters that were infinitely more fascinating than the main group and harbored more interesting traits and purposes, but as I&#039;ve already said, it wasn&#039;t their story and I shouldn&#039;t have been expecting them to play a huge role here. My own, negative idiosyncrasy. <br />
<br />
In the end, this series which still confuses me emotionally provided an exceptional conclusion to its first and most likely main story, as it wrapped up its final arcs in an acceptable and thoroughly understandable way. At its most basic, the story of adolescence and accepting that adolescence permeates through the entirety of this series. Because if we were to fully strip it down, the punchline is that there is no need to let go of that. Much like Araragi isn&#039;t willing to let go of his own, even while saying that his adolescence has left him he acknowledges that he isn&#039;t fully an adult to Hanekawa. And I don&#039;t think that is really the point of this experience. It isn&#039;t much of a coming of age story. At the climax, he doesn&#039;t let go of the oddity manifesting as his own adolescence and that&#039;s the final realization. But I don&#039;t know.<br />
<br />
But who knows, really? A series like this is so esoteric that even its most well-defined moments can be read into as something else and that&#039;s exactly what I appreciate about it. It proves itself worthy of being analyzed, as any great piece of art should. As I said in my very first venture into Monogatari, I only know what I know.

    **THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS**<br />
<br />
Just a friendly reminder. Owarimonogatari Series 2nd Season is the &#039;Direct Sequel&#039; of the Last Part of &#039;Koyomimonogatari&#039;. <br />
<br />
My, my, my. Shaft did it again. What&#039;s better than adapting one part of the Monogatari Series? Adapting flippin&#039; all of them. I was hesitant about watching the Series at first, then, I binged watch Bakemonogatari and loved it. Now, I&#039;m here at the 2nd Season of Owarimonogatari. As usual, I loved what Shaft did, I love Kamiya Hiroshi (Araragi&#039;s VA) and I loved the Series itself. <br />
<br />
This has once again blown my mind. Ougi being the Final Boss still gets me dumbfounded.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255289">
        Meme is going back too. Ougi just destroyed one of my theories about her. I love the Monologues that never failed to tamper my mind and potentially change how it works. The lines of each characters never failed to conceptually change my principles and beliefs (Or maybe I&#039;m just someone that&#039;s easy to influence?). The pacing is perfect for me and if you have watched all of the other parts before this, you should have a good grasp of the current situation. With my level of intelligence (which is low), I think I understood everything, so you&#039;ll be fine. <br />
<br />
What mattered the most for me (slightly) more than witnessing this amazing story and watching these memorable characters, is the enjoyment. If we&#039;re talking about generalities, the whole series gave it to me. But comparing the amount of enjoyment I got from the rest of the Series, Owarimonogatari 2nd Season is among the top. The first season made me doze of after a few minutes but this had me awake all night. I really enjoyed everything especially the chill atmosphere that the Hitagi Rendezvous gave. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m really excited about how the story will unfold and I&#039;m hypin&#039; up inside. I don&#039;t read the Light Novel so I don&#039;t know how this is gonna end... Well except the fact that Araragi would be alive at the very end knowing that Hanamonogatari is a thing... But hey, he died once, then lived again. You never know... <br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10. <br />
<br />
This score would likely change (increase) after I finish the series... I have high expectations for this but Shaft never failed to meet- no, exceed them.

    ***This is a spoiler free review***<br />
<br />
While I am filled with the most absolute joy towards this series than any other long-running series that I am currently aware of, there is also a feeling of melancholy as I watch this beautifully crafted mini-series end what has been such an amazing journey. The highs and the lows of the Monogatari series are coming to a conclusion (for now?)...and it is glorious. <br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
<br />
While it might not be fair to hold what I am about to say against Owarimonogatari second season, it is an absolute fact; the mini-series just needs to bring lose ends to an end. Yes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255376">
        regardless of how Owarimonogatari second season ends it is not the final piece of Monogatari content (see the  Hanamonogatari anime adaptation and any other possible volumes that haven&#039;t been adapted) but it is the end of this story line with Araragi as the main focus (I think?).<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, Owarimonogatari absolutely concludes the series gracefully and beautifully. The first part is masterfully paced and does an amazing job at hinting at what is to come later on in the mini-series. The pacing is aided heavily by the soundtrack (more about that in the sound section) but it&#039;s also the dialogue and visual direction (more about that in the art/animation section). Without going into spoilers, it just needs to be said that this season is an absolutely amazing conclusion to the main story line of Monogatari. <br />
<br />
Art/Animation: 10/10<br />
<br />
Every time you watch something from SHAFT you think that “well this is SHAFT” not knowing that the next piece of media from them changes/evolves their “style”. While the Monogatari films have their own look, the tv series has been evolving this super clean animation and art style since the first season. It is safe to say that this is Monogatari at its best tv season wise. There are also a lot of very stylized frames of animation within this season. The first part has a lot of moments where the show looks completely different than the rest of the series yet it fits in and feels like Monogatari. The colors used scream visual keys as well as just plain appealing design. Characters look great, and the detailed scenes have very good architecture. <br />
<br />
This is simply the best I&#039;ve seen SHAFT do in a tv series.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
All of the Monogatari parts (including the films) have amazing soundtracks. Some of them are good because they stay out of the way and aid in the conversations only a tiny bit (a lot of Bakemonogatari and some of Nisemonogatari) while the soundtracks can completely take control and dictate pacing (Tsukimonogatari). Owarimonogatari takes the Tsuki route and just takes you for a ride with its beautiful music. It dictates not only the pacing but also the mood very well. The music used towards the end of Araragi&#039;s first journey in the first part of the season is so masterfully done. <br />
<br />
The idea that music should not drive the movie/show (yes this is an idea circulating Hollywood currently) just doesn&#039;t make sense to me. Ever since Monogatari Second Season, the series as a whole has allowed the music to completely drive the show. I recently saw the film Dunkirk and the music was the main reason why the film felt so complete. You don&#039;t want the soundtrack/score to beat your head in with emotion but if you can nail that fine line of direction without being overbearing, you will enhance all emotions tenfold. Owarimonogatari second season absolutely nails this.<br />
<br />
The last part of this is of course the voice acting. Just...perfect is all I can really say. The second part that showcased Araragi and Senjougahara literally gave me goosebumps.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
<br />
Yup. This is it. This is the characters at their absolute best. The characters that make an appearance in this season do so with absolute style and class. Aided by on-point dialogue, visual direction, and a perfectly fitting soundtrack, they shine, fall, and exist with perfection. Since this season is the finale of this main story line, the characters have a spotlight pointed directly at them. Luckily, none of them choked. The performances were on-point and dramatic (when needed). Simply perfect.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9.8/10<br />
<br />
I&#039;m really trying to not fanboy here but it&#039;s just impossible to not see the perfection in front of my eyes. The season did it&#039;s job AND SOME. It not only concluded what needed to be concluded but also somehow added in more character development where I thought wasn&#039;t possible. Thank you SHAFT for gracing us with this marvelous series. I can now safely say that the Monogatari series my most favorite long-running series. Say what you want about the fanservice whether it is needed or not, the series is a fine example of great storytelling.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: ∞/10<br />

    As I&#039;ve seen every part of this series in this year, I can say this story gives the tip of the iceberg. It concludes the main arc it had, not only flawlessy, but add something on top of it. I rarely purchase the source material for an anime, but clearly, I will purchase the entire series. I am suggesting anyone, who is just astound how this 2nd season has an high ranking, just to watch the entire series in release order.<br />
<br />
Because there isn&#039;t really an flaw, I give the story an 10.<br />
The art was masterpiece itself. 10.<br />
I like the OST very much and it was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255541">
        always on-point. 10.<br />
Characters weren&#039;t flawed at all. 10.<br />
Enjoyment was an 11.<br />
Overall: 10/10 would watch again, but please delete my memories.

    After a few months of watching Monogatari, I finally came to the second season of Owarimonogatari. And what an experience it was. There was everything I loved about this series, complex story, great music and characters and extensive but interesting dialogues. The only problem for some people can be the pace at which first episodes go, so it might be a problem for some people, at least at the beginning I think.<br />
<br />
But the second season of Owarimonogatari has one thing that it does exceptionally well is the conclusion. It is a beautiful conclusion to the overall series.<br />
<br />
So in my opinion, it is a great conclusion

          <span style="display: none;" id="review375810">
        to the series, great anime but a little bit too fast-paced for some people. But besides that, for me at least, it was just perfect, as the anime, and as the part of Monogatari series.<br />
<br />
And to think that I started watching Monogatari only because of Renai Circulation and get such a great anime series, lol

    Originally I was only planning to watch Bakemonogatari because it was recommended to me saying it is like Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai. I did not expect after a few months I would watch the whole series and finally reach this point that I am just in awe of the trip I have taken. <br />
<br />
If this was the end, then the journey was worth it because the destination is beautiful. Though the whole series is far from perfect, as it has it&#039;s weaker season but overall, majority of them were amazing. This basically concludes everything we have seen and neatly wraps it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370462">
        all up with the one person we have seen the whole time. <br />
<br />
Obviously you have to be a fan to reach this far, because if you aren&#039;t, I don&#039;t know why you would even bother to watch this just to hate on it. Since this is like the very last one. So there&#039;s no point of reading this review if you aren&#039;t a fan of the other series. And if you plan to watch this first? Well that&#039;s just stupid. You can watch it in the release order or chronological order, it doesn&#039;t matter. All that matters is that you made it here, I hope you can enjoy it as much as I did. <br />
<br />
A satisfying conclusion to a wonderful series that does not need a continuation but if it does have one, I shall welcome it.

    (Before reading the review, or planning on watching this anime. Please do realize that this arc marked the end of the journey of Araragi&#039;s confrontations of the supernatural, amidst his occupation as a high schooler, before being graduated from being a high schooler to a college student. That being said, it&#039;s unwise and rather illogical to not watch this at the very end of the timeline, which can be discerned here (http://imgur.com/UjlhSyS). But that being said, you must watch all aired series of monogatari, excluding hanamonogatari ofc, since it&#039;s entirely irrelevant to the main story or the main attention of the plot of Koyomi, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255946">
        MC. Though, be sure to watch koyomimonogatari ep 12 last before heading toward the second season of Owarimonogatari)<br />
<br />
<br />
As the monogatari series had made itself known to me, in the beginning of time, my first impression of this series wasn&#039;t bright, I had to, almost as if, coerced myself to continue watching it given the exudes of its sense of pretense and sophistry; which I had decided to assume about the series first that I have no great first impression off, since it&#039;s only natural to doubt a philosophically deep dialogue from an anime right? That being said, that&#039;s only when my mind and thinking process are struck in the subjective sense, due to sentimentality and all of the other factor that made up subjective view. After I&#039;ve mature abit more, I started to look at things more objectively, whilst discarding the subjective ground of thinking like appealing more to sentimentality or enforcing few parts of the show I hate about to irrationally hate the show itself , listening to others to build my own ideas, trying to pander myself to the social constructed common thinking, and such. This is when I became a hardcore monogatari fan, rewatching the show like 9 times already for the past years. <br />
<br />
Then it had become my no.1 anime of all time. <br />
<br />
Digression aside, mayoi hell, hitagi renvendous and such, marked the end of the tale of Koyomi, the main lead of the story, in this great adventure of learning about the oblivion, entering into the realm of the supernatural, and adapting himself, using his own irrationality and resignation of not knowing obscured truth, to saves all the presented girls in the story. But this simply marked an end to Araragi&#039;s adolescence life, as he did in fact graduated and became, quasi, a new person entirely with the enlightened knowledge bestow by other characters, whom to which held great and unique wisdom given their differences in characters and perspectives that builds Araragi&#039;s character. Araragi started off as a pain the ass character, it changes though, and this is the quintessential growth, to that of a strong and greatly developed character through a person&#039;s adolescence, though from the perspective of an especial or an exceptional one. <br />
<br />
This arc could be named the &quot;Magnum Opus&quot; of all the monogatari series combined, I would even go as far as to say that it&#039;s prolly one of the finest, and incredibly well executed, wrapped up of all arc of the life of Koyomi before his graduation and the foreboding tales, entailing the yet to come experiences, that had yet to be known to the anime watchers (that&#039;s a different story if you are a light novel reader of the monogatari series). Incidentally, the life of those that held a great relevance to Araragi&#039;s adolescence, all of them have grown as well. The rather monotonous speech pattern, and the ever so repetitious, static personality had been abolish almost credulously; this signifies the their growth, namely, Nadeko, Senjougahara,  Hanekawa and some of the character in the show (aka, Ougi). <br />
<br />
Whilst some people maybe confused about the scene that had been replayed in Kizumonogatari in a much different setting from the movie; this second season remained true to its primal source material. Meanwhile, the movie version of kizumonogatari greatly differs from the light novel given the extensive hyperbolic visuals, differing setting, metaphors and of the lack of a more deep and plenty dialogues; though that doesn&#039;t dwindled the credibility of how Araragi and kiss shot was built, honed, or came to be.<br />
<br />
Another confusion in the this anime as well, would be the fact that in the monogatari universe, all supernatural entities that are straying from its own role, pretending to be a human/other deity or oddity, or if the observer see them doing so or realizes it (this can effect the darkness if you&#039;ve seen ep 3 of Owari second season, and back in time with kiss shot and her first minion) or acknowledge them, they get swallowed up by the darkness as its existence lives solely to rectifies abnormality. <br />
<br />
<br />
As I&#039;ve fleetingly digress, let&#039;s talk about this arc of the monogatari in particular shall we? Or let me just change that to I instead if we were to think about it logically. But, we finally got to learn about Ougi&#039;s actual identity in this second season of Owari. It had been hinted directly and even indirectly like the exuding air of her ominous aura or appearances , but it literally flew past by our heads given that we had already, instinctively even, enclosed the possibility of that to be true. The very great thing about this though, the show manages to creates this brim of articulate connections, from the facts that are not known, or left to be obscured to us but is slightly told throughout the series (like Kiss-shot&#039;s past from 400 years ago when she became a new god there), and the very obvious ones consisting of Araragi&#039;s interactions with all characters, basically, his entire adolescence as a whole. <br />
<br />
Since spoiling here is imminent and almost inevitable if I were to lay out bare the great level of  intricacy structure of the display of the connections, I&#039;ll just left some part of the show&#039;s revelation left untouched, lest you&#039;re already spoiled by some reviewers here, in which I will not be doing. <br />
<br />
All in all, the greatness of the music production and its great segue for each scene never made me questioned the inappropriateness of the director&#039;s selections, the extraneous scenes and playful background movement amidst the dialogue always makes it alot more bearable, but in this case, very entertaining to both appreciating the dialogue, the voice acting, and the visuals. Never had I got bored watching the intensive hour of the first episode, Mayoi Hell, the second episode, Hitagi rendezvous, the third episode, Ougi Dark; all thanks to the great production of music and such, that the director and the staffs gave in each episodes. The revelation, or the main plot that builds itself since and of the entire monogatari series, had ended with a very good and meaningful plot twist (a plot twist for you if you&#039;re not Gaen Izuko lmao) that left me with a feeling of awe, an elated one. It&#039;s very rare for an anime, or even a story, that had solely rely its dialogue, to move the plot forward to be this fun to watch. The simplicity of a fighting show, harem show or any other story hold no chance against this piece of work that we called, the monogatari series. That maybe an exaggeration, but I have yet to see any show that wrapped the entirety of its show as good as this.  <br />
<br />
The disturbing scenes that encroached the norms of our century, the pedophilia like interactions or thoughts, the incest, the first ever scene of someone getting aroused from having their teeth being brushed by another person, the perversion, all of it are not a complete representation of what the show has to offers.  As far as it stands, it don&#039;t negates the intellectualism that the dialogues has which includes many of the fundamental core message or purpose of a life lessons, the wisdom, the perspective, idealism or convictions crashing with another person&#039;s, and so forth. And ofc, not all dialogue from this show are that serious all the time, most of the time though, they are relevant to honing Araragi&#039;s character and of the other ones (like Kaiki for instance). <br />
That being said, this anime is prolly one of the best anime out there yet, and the most unique amongst all, and it&#039;s a must watch if you haven&#039;t finish watching the show yet. <br />

    Look, if youv&#039;e gotten this far in the series, you&#039;re not gonna be reading reviews to check if you should finish. This review is for people who are wondering if this is a series that will be worth investing in, or for those who just finished the first one or two series and are thinking &quot;...is this worth it?&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a review of Monogatari. The great, sleazy, sprawling empire of Monogatari. With much love and in keeping with the style of the show itself, I&#039;ll make sure it&#039;s a disorganized disaster area.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s been a while since I wrote a review, but MONOGATARI IS OVER and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review259030">
        the sentimental poeticism of that fact spurred me to fill out these heinous numerical scores once more. Of course, Monogatari isn&#039;t really over. We&#039;ll no doubt soon be facing down Owariszokumudamonogatari or whatever 354,653th side story/spinoff pops up to fill the void left in many a loyal fan&#039;s heart. However, the main story is done, there&#039;s no doubting that, and that&#039;s good enough for me. I&#039;m out. I can&#039;t take any more. I managed to make it to the end of this season pretty much just by riding the rocketship of nostalgia. Good god, how many sloppy cgi slideshows must we endure? For this loyal fan, the magic is over.<br />
<br />
Which, I suppose, means the series worked.<br />
<br />
I mean seriously, when I first started watching this behemoth epic many moons ago I was just a dumb college freshman (or something close) and I fell in, hook line and sinker. The convoluted problems of Araragi and his friends ranged from life-changing to so cryptic that I was forced to fall back on that most shameful of actions, looking up essays written by other more experienced critics in order to understand what the f**k I had just watched. I was mesmerized by Hitagi (heh) and her callous glamor, Hanekawa and her poisonous external perfectionism, Nadeko and her disturbing emptiness, and of course Araragi and his flaky, self-deprecating, morally-questionable, creepy, dense thought process. The show was magic. Broken, messy, and inexplicably relatable, Monogatari was an emotionally-poignant series of truths I wouldv&#039;e had trouble coming to alone. It felt like a respite from a mad world of superficiality, a beacon of integrity that actually tried to be real. Sure, it was often gross and off-topic, but that only served to make it feel more legitimate. I remember my youthful head-over-heels fanboy self writing that &quot;Monogatari, unlike any other work of fiction, understands the tumultuous chaos of daily living. This show&#039;s true apparition is life itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Look, I know half of you hate this franchise. I&#039;ve heard it been denounced as pandering bilge, try-hard philosophy for middle-schoolers, cash-grab pornography, and self-indulgent holier-than-though psychology more dated than Freud. And I&#039;m not really gonna defend it: it&#039;s got all of those elements in it. The Monogatari Franchise is one massive experiment in everything, and as is charachteristic of experiments, things often go horribly awry. But, somehow, after wading through all of the literal human feces (*cough*cough* Tsukimonogatari) we&#039;ve reached the conclusion to that experiment, and have found ourselves with a truly excessive coming-of-age story or something. And, it turns out, what made the franchise work or not wasn&#039;t any of its own merits: it was what the viewer brought to the table. &quot;I am imperfect&quot; is a fact I acknowledge readily. &quot;I want to do better&quot; is another. &quot;I can recognize some of my most detrimental flaws, but even then I have difficulty figuring out how to address them, and these are such difficult and personal concerns that I don&#039;t really know how to foist them onto someone else&quot; is one as well. When I started this series, I was looking for answers. Answers about my own habits and traits, answers about how other people&#039;s minds might work, answers regarding that slow-burning yet indestructible anxiety that perpetually lives in the back of my mind. Monogatari was willing to listen, to offer advice, to never try to hand anything ut on a platter: its coded images and style and writing made me work to figure out what it was trying to tell me, and through that allowed me to figure out for myself the thoughts I was missing. And that was magical.<br />
<br />
And now we&#039;ve reached the end.<br />
<br />
Now it&#039;s just a story. It&#039;s not the embodiment of life or a tried-and-true philosophical 5-course meal. It&#039;s an often-frustrating story about a bunch of great characters with sometimes-brilliant, sometimes-infuriating presentation. That was was struck me most watching this final season: everything I fell in love with was still there, but I had grown past it. That doesn&#039;t mean it wasn&#039;t satisfying as all hell to watch all these long-struggling plot threads reach something resembling a resolutions, or that I wasn&#039;t secretly praying that they&#039;d play the world-renowned masterpiece Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari just ONE MORE TIME (even though the whole point is that we&#039;ve grown way past that song&#039;s message). By all metrics (asides from, perhaps, visual creativity) this season was just as good as any of the previous ones and more. It&#039;s just... well... Monogatari finally caught up to itself.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t feel confusing or convoluted anymore.<br />
<br />
I no longer begrudge its antagonists or condemn its flawed characters.<br />
<br />
I no longer feel as though its winding labyrinth is something I can get lost in.<br />
<br />
So I guess...<br />
<br />
SHOULD YOU WATCH THIS BIG, HORRIBLE THING KNOWN AS MONOGATARI?<br />
<br />
Here I sit, many years after beginning the epic franchise, and I am aware, even now, that though I may not often reminisce upon the passion this winding saga once drew from me, that is merely because I have channeled that passion into other places. But, more importantly, the reason I have become the person I am today (aka a functioning, employed, yet dreaming and ambitious member of society) is in part thanks to this series. Is that enough for you? It depends on who you are, and who you want to be.<br />
<br />
Are you imperfect?<br />
<br />
Do you want to better?<br />
<br />
Are you humble enough to put a little bit of faith into one of those trashy anime things?<br />
<br />
Monogatari is a mess, but it also genuinely cares about you. If you want to condemn it, it&#039;s easy. It&#039;s got a bunch of issues. That&#039;s why I&#039;m not even discussing all that animation/plot/sound nonsense. We&#039;re past that. As sappy as it sounds, if you open your heart to it it will open its heart to you. It will challenge you and laugh with you and care with you. It will pull out your passion and give it to you to hold. &quot;Do with this what you wish&quot; it will say, expecting no loyalty in return. And, as its final gift, it will bring you to the finale with a knowing smile on your face, knowing that you care about all these lovable idiot characters, but most of all that you care about yourself. <br />
<br />
Or maybe it wont. Maybe you&#039;ll just think it&#039;s dumb.<br />
<br />
Only one way to find out.

    Like everyone who has watched Monogatari to this point, I&#039;m obviously a huge fan of the show, which is why it pains me to say this, but: Owarimonogatari 2nd Season is overrated.  Honestly, several parts of the Monogatarai series are better than this, including the first season.  And while it was an enjoyable entry, I kind of expected more, considering this is the highest ranked of all the Monogatari series.  But, in truth, this turned into one massive cop out after another.  <br />
<br />
MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD: <br />
<br />
If there is one thing that I hate in any medium of entertainment, it&#039;s when creators

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297294">
        or directors are too scared to make permanent changes to the formula that made them popular.  This hatred is exacerbated when they appear to make those changes and then reverse them for a happy ending.  Owarimonogatari S2 was too scared to pull the trigger on three major occasions, instead opting to undo or swerve out of it.  <br />
<br />
1. They reversed the death of Mayoi, with Araragi dragging her out of hell.  <br />
2. Shinobu was completely restored, something that was foreshadowed and everyone was worried about throughout the whole show, but she decides to go right back to being a little girl again.  <br />
3. Ougi looks like she&#039;ll die, but then they do a last second Dues Ex Machina to save her.  <br />
<br />
Now, I love Hachikuji, I love Shinobu and I love Ougi, I&#039;m happy that Hachikuji is back, I&#039;m happy that Shinobu didn&#039;t leave Araragi (not that she would) and I&#039;m happy that Ougi survived.  But, going for the safe happy ending on every front, even undoing previous bold creative choices, makes for a low-stakes anime and removes any sense of long-term consequences for their actions.  This, in turn, drives down the suspense of the show.  It feels like nothing truly matters because no one will die and everything can be undone with living strings dropping into hell and acting as dragonballs. <br />
<br />
Now, that&#039;s not to say that this wasn&#039;t a good anime, but it could have been so much better if they had&#039;ve had the courage to stick with at least one of those changes.  At the very least Ougi should have died. Ougi is my third favorite character in the anime behind Araragi and Mayoi, but she should have died.  Let there be a sense of loss.  Deus Ex Machinas are the tools of unadventurous artists.  And in this case, undid what could&#039;ve been a true classic, rather than just a great anime.  <br />
<br />
Also, another thing I didn&#039;t care for is how useless they&#039;ve made Hitagi.  She finally gets some significant screen time and she&#039;s mainly just a regular girlfriend.  Why have they made one of the most important and intriguing characters in the show a side-thought?  I miss the sadistic and some what frightening Senjougahara.  Ever since things wrapped up with Kaiki Deshu, she&#039;s like a defanged tiger with little screen time.  But, in getting more screen time this season, it was even more apparent that what made Hitagi great has been greatly diminished.  I was actually trying to stay awake during their date.  <br />
<br />
It may sound like I hated this season, but I didn&#039;t.  It was entertaining, the dialogue was as sharp as always the mystery and intrigue was there as usual.  (Although, the identity of Ougi was something pretty obvious, especially after classroom episode in the first season.).  It was still good.  Really, I just felt like they missed an opportunity to really shake things up in a memorable way with all the creative cop outs.  &quot;By the way, this is me pleading for my life.&quot; should have been a legendary moment.  It was cheapened by the plea working.  <br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
Art: 10<br />
Sound: 10<br />
Character: 10<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
Overall: 7<br />
<br />
Again, it gets high scores from me, but it&#039;s still overrated.  Cop outs just leave a bad taste in my mouth.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Since the Monogatari series started, it&#039;s been a series about confrontation. It was all about the girls learning how they should confront their past. Senjougahara had to confront her past with Kaiki. Hachikuji was not able to fix her problems, but was able to establish how she was happy with her current state and understand what she enjoyed about it. I don&#039;t want to include any major spoilers for the rest of the series, so I won&#039;t talk about anyone else, but I&#039;m sure you can think of this theme yourself. Kanbaru, Nadeko, Hanekawa, and Oikura&#039;s situations are pretty obvious. Many

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394525">
        times, Araragi was not able to properly save the girls, and this is where another important theme of the series comes in: It&#039;s Oshino&#039;s iconic quote: &quot;I&#039;m not going to save you, just lending a hand. Only you can save yourself.&quot; What I mean by confronting one&#039;s past is that those who struggle have to do it on their own, they end up lying to themselves and ignore this other part of themselves. You could even say that they&#039;re procrastinating. This is exactly why the oddities are such a brilliant part of the series. They&#039;re really just and embodiment of the struggles they go through, that remind them of how they should not ignore this other side of themselves. Which is why the oddities can only exist if the victim believes that they do.<br />
<br />
From here, I&#039;ll be talking about some spoilers in Owarimonogatari 2nd Season itself. If you haven&#039;t watched it yet, please stop reading. This is an amazing anime and I don&#039;t want someone to miss out on the enjoyment of it because of me.<br />
<br />
Whenever we would see a case with an oddity in the Monogatari series, the victim&#039;s backstory would always be explained before the climax of the arc, so as viewers, we&#039;d never really end up experiencing their past before they were attacked by the oddity. However, we&#039;ve been following Araragi since the start of the series, and experiencing his story first hand. During this amazing experience, Araragi has been suffering. He&#039;s been destroyed from the inside out because of his tendency to criticize himself. He&#039;s always ended up putting others before himself and not taking the other side of himself into consideration.<br />
<br />
Oshino Ougi has always been a strange character. She claims to be Oshino Meme&#039;s niece, but is she? I&#039;m sure that anyone watching the Monogatari series almost immediately knew that something was wrong about her. She&#039;s not an average Araragi harem member. And she is. She is probably the strangest character in the Monogatari series, which is a pretty big accomplishment among all of the weird characters. Her true identity was never really stated, but it was definitely foreshadowed. I&#039;m sure many people were able to guess that she is an apparition because of how she acts in Owarimonogatari. But what&#039;s so amazing is how her complete identity was foreshadowed from the moment she was introduced.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#039;t know anything, Araragi-senpai. You&#039;re the one who knows.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is her main catchphrase and also an amazing example of how her identity was foreshadowed from the beginning. Different variations of this phrase are used by different characters, and end up perfectly characterizing parts of these characters with only a few words. Some examples are when Hanekawa says &quot;I don&#039;t know everything, I only know what I know.&quot; showing her trademark humbleness, or when Izuko says &quot;There is nothing that I don&#039;t know. I know everything.&quot; showing how prideful she is and possibly also foreshadowing parts of the light novels, which I haven&#039;t read yet, so I wouldn&#039;t know.<br />
<br />
Owarimonogatari 2nd season also has some amazing dialogue and wordplay, which I don&#039;t think I want to or need to cover here. Everyone praises the shit out of the dialogue and wordplay in the Monogatari series because it&#039;s really good. Also I don&#039;t speak Japanese<br />
<br />
Everything that we love about the Monogatari series comes together to deliver one of the greatest 7 episodes of all time. Owarimonogatari 2nd Season combines the themes of saving yourself, the amazing character writing, the foreshadowing, the dialogue, and everything else to show us one of the best stories of all time.<br />
<br />
Araragi, the character we&#039;ve been following this entire time finally confronts his own tendency to criticize himself in the form of Oshino Ougi. But once the true identity of Ougi has been revealed, what will happen to her? Oshino Meme himself appears after so long and acknowledges her as his &quot;niece&quot;, which allows her to live longer as a real person. After all, oddities can only exist if you believe that they do. This experience finally allows Araragi to mature and end his teenage years and his character arc. Araragi and the viewer is left with a very valuable lesson by the end of this series: Do your best to help others, but before that you should think of yourself!

-------------------- Owarimonogatari Second Season --------------------<br />
<br />
Well, it has beeen 2 years since the last monogatari series, and boy! let me tell you  that the wait was worth it! absolutely worth it. First I have to say that the Monogatari Series is my favorite anime of all time, and this season proved why. <br />
<br />
[ART &amp; ANIMATION]<br />
<br />
Shaft did a pretty good job with the art style and animation, it doesnt have a lot of details but it fits great with the anime. It is also consistent with the other series and it has an interesting way of desing, that has been seen since the first season aired.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256133">
        The desing of the background that is simple and also using no background characters was a thing I only saw with shaft and their works. Something that I really like is the way that by giving background to the viewer with the cards that appeare now and then in each episode (and the whole series as well). We also get to se the art work of Gekidan INU Curry for a part in Mayoi Hell and the ending as well, which is pretty nice art style and uncommon to see in anime (the other anime that, I know of, of having that art style is madoka with their witches). Personally I prefer the art style of the anime more than the movies. Also the animation is smooth to the eye and isn&#039;t that heavy to the eye so is easy to watch. The only thing is that if you want to read the cards, you need to be pretty fast to actually post the video so you can read it. 10/10<br />
<br />
[SOUND]<br />
<br />
The sound had good quality and I personally enjoy it. I love the music of the openings and ending of the series, sang by the voice actor of Mayoi Hachikuji (Emiri Katou) and Ougi Oshino (Kaori Mizuhashi). The soundtrack its pretty well done and gives the ambient of the story the feeling of being alive. The voice actors did a pretty good job with their characters, they portrayed it well and they are consistent with their works on this series. I enjoy every work of the voice actos and the way they said the lines fit perfect for me with those compared to the book. The diaologue its fast and serious with sometimes hitting the comical absurd. 10/10<br />
<br />
[STORY]<br />
<br />
I dont want to spoil anyone, so this part is going to be pretty quick. This story takes place after the events that happened in Koyomimonogatari. Its the parts of Mayoi Hell, Hitagi Rendezvous and Ougi Dark. The characters have the same personality and the dialogu exchange is quick and stupidly confussing. They do a lot of word play with the kanji of different things, like the word play with Senjougahara&#039;s driving license. It also gives background of the story with the different cards that appeared throught the episodes. The story is pretty good and get your tissues ready, because you are going to need a lot and I dont mean it because of the fan service (honestly now that I think about it, it doesn&#039;t have any fan service at all compared to the other seasons). Even though the season was sort of 2 hours long, Shaft did a good job on narriating the parts with great detail on them. The story is pretty easy to understand and to catch all the things from the beggining, that lead to the ending of the story. Story 10/10 <br />
<br />
[CONCLUSION]<br />
<br />
The Owarimonogatari s2 brought to me a lot of nostalgia and feelings, because of a huge fan I am. Honestly, if the world ends tomorrow, I would die happily knowing that I could watch this season. Owarimonogatari s2 was the best part of monogatari so far, and I highly recommend to watch it (only if you have seen the other series). If you love monogatari as same as me, then I will assure you thhat you are going to like this one as well. My Overall rating 10/10

    Owarimonogatari’s Second Season is essentially the climax of the series, or at least one of them. We finally get to see others take care of Araragi in the same manner he takes care of others. Owarimonogatari II features and resolves Araragi’s Ghost Stories in a similar fashion it has featured and resolved every other character’s. <br />
<br />
Having said that, from a purely execution perspective, it is about as average as it gets. It looks, feels, sounds, and is, essentially, simply another arc. It does not try to do or be more than Araragi’s resolution. From a plot perspective, it ties everything together so elegantly it’ll leave

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315665">
        you thunderstruck. Owarimonogatari II brings just about everything that’s ever happened in all of Monogatari together with unwavering purpose. It is simultaneously shocking and wholesome how related things are in the series that seemed completely unrelated. Owarimonogatari II is a storytelling spectacle. <br />
<br />
Owarimonogatari II is so good it almost warrants a rewatch of the entire series solely to pick up on more of the nuances that it strives on. I only half remembered some things referenced in Owarimonogatari II. I had many, “oh, that’s why that happened” moments. <br />
<br />
One last thing I’d like to point out about the plot is that even though there are technically three different arcs in Owarimonogatari II, it certainly feels like just one. To me, it’s a stretch to say that there is a snail arc, a crab arc, and a darkness arc in Owarimonogatari II. I would call it borderline ludicrous to say there’s a snail arc. We learn absolutely nothing new about Hachikuji, she serves solely as a plot device in Owarimonogatari II. To me, all of Owarimonogatari II is a vampire arc. <br />
<br />
Owarimonogatari II is probably what most people watch the Monogatari series for. Owarimonogatari II is the amalgamation of themes and storylines in the Monogatari series, it is the end goal. Having said that, I still don’t think it’s in the top 3 arcs of the series. I’d probably put it somewhere between 4 and not the worst. Don’t get me wrong, Owarimonogatari II is good, but it’s no Kizumonogatari II, Nekomonogatari: Shiro, or Sodachi Arc. Again, I’d put it somewhere below those but not last. <br />
<br />
Owarimonogatari II is THE must-watch arc of all Monogatari; however, you do need to watch everything before this to fully enjoy it. And I mean everything, Kizumonogatari, Koyomimonogatari, Nisemonogatari and all. Leave no stone left unturned if you’re planning on watching Owarimonogatari II.

    Owarimonogatar Season 2 clearly solved all the problems and questions we always had throughout the series. We could say this is the end(but not technically). I really enjoyed watching this and was totally immersed during the whole 3 episodes. Not to mention in light novel as well.<br />
<br />
The story, as I mentioned before, it answers all the questions we had before. For example, &quot;why is Hachikuji here again&quot;, &quot;where did Meme and Kagenui go&quot;, &quot;why did Gaen kill Koyomi&quot;, &quot;who and what tf is Ougi plotting.&quot; All these little questions are solved in this story. It was also outstanding of Nisio Ishin answering each question one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255377">
        by one through the show and gratifying viewers slowly.<br />
<br />
The second arc which is Hitagi Rendezvous showed a good rapport between Senjougahara and Araragi. We didn&#039;t get much opportunity to see them being together in recent stories so I believe it was a good time to show this. Lastly, the post credit scene I should say it was amazing. The gloomy theme and Ougi leaving some fishy lines were matched well. That made me eagerly want to see what&#039;s going to happen next. Bringing up this much excitement was well done.<br />
<br />
In Ougi Dark episode, everything happens is big spoilers but I&#039;ll try my best to not spoil a lot. I liked when Gaen was about to disclose the truth of Ougi, the scene immediately changed. I was rather disappointed here, but then again, they used this method to keep me immersed. I also liked how all these little clues from previous stories (Araragi&#039;s sense of guilt, Shinobu eating Seishirou) made Ougi. I did not expect anything like those to be a big part of this story.<br />
<br />
Araragi appeared again with this &#039;sudden change of mind to save that person&#039;. He did it to Hachikuji (which was great) and he did it again to Ougi. I guess that really isn&#039;t changeable for Araragi; However, I like that heroic side of him.<br />
<br />
Hachikuji&#039;s comeback was truly amazing and loved the conversation with Arararagi. Also, I was quite surprised that a snail is superior to snakes. Didn&#039;t really make sense for me but okay. Hanekawa did a great job and not to mention Meme as well. I saw myself automatically smiling when Meme came in with his catchphrase. No wonder why he&#039;s my favourite member from Araragi Harem. He always resolves big conflicts or problems happening to most characters. I felt bad for Gaen but at the same time, it was funny because nothing really worked out for her in this story.<br />
<br />
I should say this is the best and also my favourite story from entire Monogatari series. It was the most enjoyable story in the entire series. I strongly recommend watching all the Monogatari series to who haven&#039;t watched yet. <br />
<br />
Overall, I will give this a 10/10.<br />

    The second season of Owarimonogatari was the perfect way to end the main story line of the series. Comprising of three arcs, the first two serve as mostly set up material for the last arc to have a lasting impact on the audience.<br />
The art and animation is in the signature style you would come to expect from Studio Shaft. The use of the soundtrack is sparse or just serves as a backdrop to the show, except for a few moments where it&#039;s use in conjunction with an important scene. Out of all the seasons/movies of the Monogatari series, I enjoyed this particular one the most.

    Amazing.<br />
<br />
They did it.<br />
<br />
Nisio and Shaft managed to give a proper ending to a series in which one misstep could bring forth its doom.<br />
<br />
As I wasn&#039;t particularly a fan of Tsuki (in this case, just some aspects of it, as I enjoyed it overall) Koyomi and the first part of Owarimonogatari, I was genuinely mindful that this could end as a screw up, even if I had all my hopes up for it.<br />
<br />
The recurring problem with the Monogatari series, in my view, comes precisely from its <br />
strength. The  obvious enemy of a good series that focuses on delivering its story by a lot of dialogue

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256110">
        is the lack of something worthwhile to say. Many times, it relied way too much on repetitive overexpository dialogue of things the viewer had already understood like they were retarded or something, way too much uninteresting idle chatter (this can come off as subjective, but the casual plot unrelated chit chat of the series kinda died for me after Second Season) and, yes, stupid fan service.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think it is the case that Shaft&#039;s producers noticed that. Even though it&#039;s still a frequent complaint by (western, at least) fans of the series, the general acclaim each new season usually receives implies that they are still doing something right.<br />
<br />
However, maybe it&#039;s the fact that this season lacked virtually all of the flaws I listed before that made it so special and and ending fitting of the sprawling story of Monogatari, together with the excellent plot.<br />
<br />
Instead of spending overtime with meaningless froth and silly fan service, they focused on interesting conversations concerning the story, its character and the development of both, which this series conveyed in a way that, honestly, is only comparable with Season Season, and even then I couldn&#039;t say which of them had the most interesting and important character developments of the series. All episodes and all moments were importants before finally leading to the conclusion of the first Monogatari &quot;mega arc&quot; comprising all the tales told until that moment, and how Araragi&#039;s future was and would be affected by it.<br />
<br />
My inspiration to write this has just extinguished right now, but I am just glad that, in the end, this series didn&#039;t disappoint me. It&#039;s way to easy to end predictively or coarsely whenever a story sprawls to the point when some of its parts may be better if forsaken from the whole, but at the same time refreshing when a series prove your worries wrong and lets you out of it with a smile on your face. <br />
<br />
I could not ask for a better sense of closure.<br />
<br />
It was all worth it. Thank you.

    Owarimonogatari 2nd Season was perfectly created, I hardly can point out problems with this season and adaption. Nearly every scenes creates a tense atmosphere making the viewers iterate their thoughts what will the characters do, what Araragi will do. Apart from assaulting Hachijuki.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
I personally thought the story was well made, it has mix of emotions teach parts of the story which constantly manages to keep the viewers interested. The further you go through the episodes, more the excitement grows. We all want to know who Ougi is, we all want to see what Araragi wants or does. That&#039;s why the story is perfection. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
I can&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255438">
        really say much about the art, through out the Monogatari Series all the arts and designs are interesting and well created. The scenes are hilarious and made well creating plenty of humour and awe for the viewers. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
One of the best thing Monogatari Series can have pride on is their soundtracks and OST. How they blend with the story perfectly. The OST is placed perfectly without interfering the story rather enhancing it instead. You can never get enough of Mayoi&#039;s stutters. The OP created were amazing as usual as well as the ENDING by ClariS; the versatile duo. Shiroi (Ending) was a suitable choice as it&#039;s really beautiful to hear. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
I kinda do miss Ononoki&#039;s old phrases, she&#039;s funny as usual alongside Mayoi. They really were hilarious during the serious talks, but that&#039;s what makes the series interesting, where the characters do something humorous. Furthermore, we got saw different emotions especially how Ougi feels about the situation and Araragi&#039;s thought thoughts through out the show, his characteristics in important scenes really shows he is one of the best characters in the anime history. But what really made me full of joy was seeing old characters return throughout the story including mentions and arrivals. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
There was plenty of enjoyment seeing old characters, hilarious sub scenes and plenty of emotional scenes. I wouldn&#039;t really call it a rollercoaster of emotions but it has the usual Monogatari Series enjoyment but the finisher to this adaption was perfect. <br />
<br />
Overall, I would recommend people to start watching already since this special is well developed. I am sure Arararagi-kun will be proud of you. I meant Bararagi-kun. Sorry I stuttered.
