    First, let me say that I\&#039;m not a fan of boxing. In fact, I pretty much hate the sport. Honestly, who likes seeing people getting their head beat in every day?<br />
<br />
With that being said, this series is brilliantly done. There\&#039;s comedy, romance, and plenty, plenty, plenty of plot. Follow Ippo as he grows as a person and as a professional boxer. You\&#039;ll laugh, and you\&#039;ll probably cry here or there. The fact that I don\&#039;t even like boxing never came in to play. You\&#039;ll probably find yourself doing some jabs here and there while watching the show too. It\&#039;s that captivating.<br />
<br />
The supporting characters are awesome.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10">
        Takamura, Kimura and Aoki are all equally hilarious. Each has a distinct personality that make them all very lovable. They also support Ippo as he meets his trials of boxing and life. <br />
<br />
Definitely give this series a try. You won\&#039;t be disappointed with the 76 episodes. In fact, you\&#039;ll probably end up reading the manga because you don\&#039;t want it to stop!

    &quot;What? 76 episodes of… boxing?  76 episodes set in a small square ring?  Yeah, right.&quot;<br />
<br />
I had no idea.  <br />
<br />
What makes this anime special is undoubtedly the characters.  How each character is so likeable, so original, and so fully developed that you end up understanding, caring, and rooting for them in the end.  How even the ones that only last an episode, even Ippo&#039;s opponents can be given such plausible and staggering backstories that you might actually find yourself siding against the main hero for a match or two.  And how these characters are just so serious with their lives

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31888">
        that you really feel it, and you end up believing that such a world could actually exist out there.     <br />
<br />
You know you love an anime when it drives you to shout, to hold your breath, and to jump right out of your seat.  You know you love an anime when the thrill makes your spine tingle so much that you actively root and cheer and punch the air in victory as if you were right there ringside. You know you love it when you marathon through 15 episodes one night, and wake the next morning only to continue watching.  And even after 76 episodes and two bonuses, you can&#039;t let go.  They&#039;ve already wrapped you up in that world, those characters, their lives, their ambitions, and suddenly… suddenly you&#039;re expected to just leave?  <br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
You know you love an anime when you&#039;re showing it to a friend and you somehow end up watching the entire thing again with him/her.  And you still shout, you still laugh, you still find yourself out of your seat punching the air the second, the third, the sixth time you&#039;ve seen it. <br />
<br />
And you can&#039;t stop smiling.  Because you get to live in their world again. <br />

    **THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS**<br />
<br />
The anime makes use of every character it introduces and develops them very convincingly and you can really connect to them. Such as Ippo in gaining more confidence and motivation, Takamura in wanting to become a champion and a hero, and Miyata wanting to prove that his father’s boxing style is the best. The characters all have back-stories of why they became fighters but they still live lives in certain ways you can still relate to them and they all have every day issues as real boxers would have such as Takamura’s weight control. As for the pacing, yes, the anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6543">
        is long and the manga is 10 times longer, but still evenly paced and I feel the intention after getting to a certain point is that Morikawa-sensei wants to tell a life story in the same way Araki-sensei does with Jojo and you really start to feel that and you really feel the character’s grow and there are times you can emotionally react or care what could happen to that character.<br />
<br />
The art style is very faithful to that of the style of the manga, except I felt that the bodies looked blockier and more massive than they needed to be in comparison to it. Plus, the venues such as Kourakuen Hall and the surrounding environments are well accurately represented because I’ve been there before on a number of occasions and fought in a judo tournament there so I thought that was pretty cool. I really love the training sequences with Ippo and he comes up with crazy methods and is an animal. The only real life athlete I can think of that compares to Ippo’s training ethic and regime is UFC fighter Sean Sherk. <br />
<br />
And now lets get down to the heart and soul of this anime, and that is the fights. As someone who can’t stand the trendy over the top repetitive action you see in some animes today, this is definitely a liberation. This anime proves you don’t need fire balls or bullet time or any of that trendy bullshit to make a great fight. This is an anime that truly accurately portrays the technique, excitement, and intensity of the real sport of boxing by implementing all these real life moves and fighting styles. 1st example is Ippo. He is based on a prime Mike Tyson who uses the peek a boo stance, worked the body, and had an effective jab once he got on the inside. Sendo Takeshi is based on Razor Ruddock with his smash punch which is a mix between a hook and an uppercut. And Mashiba is based on Thomas Hearns where he uses his freakish reach to use a crazy jabbing system. And Hayami, you think his shotgun is unrealistic? Before Ali got suspended, he had incredible speed, 10x faster than the Ali who came back who was still pretty fast. There’s a video of Ali out there where he landed 15 punches in 3 seconds. And you know the old saying of how styles make fights? Well, that saying is applied very well in this anime and applies it very well and is just poetry in motion.<br />
<br />
<br />
The dub seriously sucks. Takamura sounds like Adam Carolla. Ippo just doesn’t fit. Miyata sounds like a chain smoker. And the sound quality and the overall execution is just as bad as GTO’s dub where it sounded like they hired 5 voice actors. Avoid the dub at all cost. But once again, time to give you more info on the seiyuu cast. It’s very interesting to note that the voice of Kaoru from Prince of Tennis, Kiyasu Kohei plays Ippo himself. Despite that deep and hissing voice is the nerdy and assuming Ippo. And one of my personal favorites Tomokazu Seki plays my favorite character Miyata. He does a great job of being that lone wolf kind of character and knows how to keep his cool. And I truly felt that Takagi Wataru, the voice of Onizuka from GTO was born to play Aoki. And Onosaka Masaya the voice of Momoshiro in Prince of Tennis and Vash the Stampede from Trigun was also born to play Sendo. If anything, this is an anime that is truly meant to be watched in Japanese. <br />
<br />
The music is also pretty awesome and a quality you can’t deny which you can’t get in manga obviously. The opening themes Under Star and Inner Light have a heavy intense feel to it where you can really emotionally react to the clips in the opening theme and to the scenes whenever presented as a background song in the anime itself. And I like how the ending themes 360 and Yuuzora no Kamihikouki gives a different kind of emotional reaction where it’s more about relating to the characters and the hardships they go through, but yet there’s this huge reward waiting for them at the end. <br />
<br />
The only significant flaw I would say is that they ended this anime where the excitement truly begins in the manga. I say Ippo conquering Japan is just only the beginning because after that, the other characters get more focused and the development gets deeper and the fights get better. But overall, this anime has excellent themes in finding something you’re good at, and sticking to it and always keep believing. The good news is, you really don’t have to be a boxing fan or have any knowledge of boxing to really get into this anime. This anime will probably do it for you. After awhile, you start saying to yourself, how would Ippo do against Manny Pacquiao, or how would Takamura do against Roy Jones, Jr. So it really sparks interest in that kind of way from what I’ve experienced. Also, this anime truly accurately represents the Japanese feel of boxing itself. If you ever watch Japanese fighters, they are very exciting to watch. They love to go at it and fight with every last ounce of breath. I really have no experience competing in actual boxing since I’m more of a traditional martial arts kind of guy, but I only took up boxing for awhile just to improve my hands and when you’re training, you just got that tempting feeling to do the moves from the series and even train like Ippo because the things he does, you can go out and try for yourself for real since you can’t fly or shoot fire balls. I say that alone is magically captivating. If you want an anime free of virtually every stereotype and cliché, this one is for you.<br />

    Hajime no Ippo (Fighting Spirit) is a fantastic Shounen, Sports, Comedy, Action anime produced by one of the greatest studios ever (Madhouse). Even though it doesn’t tell the entire story, the story it does tell is truly amazing, with all its manliness.<br />
<br />
It’s about your classic teenage underdog (Ippo Makunoichi) who’s pretty shy and gets bullied and looked down upon, by some of his peers. Then one fateful day he comes across a boxing gym, with a great pro boxer, and soon attains the desire to become a boxer. Sure this set-up sounds very typical for a shounen sports drama but I personally enjoyed this story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5157">
        about the underdog overcoming continual obstacles. This formula does get pretty repetitive after a while but the flow during and between matches; helps set the steady pace of the developing story. Shame it had to end though.<br />
<br />
Ippo is the character that this entire series revolves around and that is good because he’s a very likable character for the average viewer. It is easy for some viewers including myself to relate to his desire to be reborn and what’s more is that viewers can watch him develop and struggle to achieve his goal. What’s also great is that plenty of time is spent introducing and giving some back-story behind Ippo’s opponent, before the match, which makes things more interesting when his opponent also has a valid reason to win. Furthermore there are quite a few supporting characters to enjoy as well, because some are just truly hilarious.<br />
<br />
The quality of the animation may be dated but thanks to Madhouse’s expert animators, it suits this anime adaptation perfectly. There’s even quite a fair bit of detail put into the surroundings. Sure the character designs are very unappealing but what matters in this manly show is the actual boxing, which is animated perfectly. The characters move fluidly but sadly there are quite a few corners cut, especially when it comes to recycling scenes. <br />
<br />
The quality of the sound is awesome; above all when it comes to the fighting with powerful SFX for the punches and a thumping soundtrack to go with it. There are also quite a few mellow tunes to go with the everyday goings on but some of them are inferior compared to others.<br />
<br />
Overall Hajime no Ippo is a highly entertaining anime series that is able to capture the pure essence of boxing, with some truly memorable bouts. Even though the whole “overcome any obstacle with hard work” thing is getting a bit played out in the shounen genre, it still proved to be an effective plot device in this series. Some may be daunted by the sheer length of this series (76 episodes); nevertheless if you the type of person who enjoys this type of combat shounen anime, then without a doubt you’ll enjoy the experience.<br />

    Hajime no Ippo.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a name that sets it mark after you finish watching it.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine recommended this anime and I just couldn&#039;t understand what would be so great... about boxing. And even more so how it could stay interesting for 75 episodes. I decided to give it a go after seeing such positive reviews and the scores this anime was given and I must say this was one of the best animes I have seen. There are few animes where you end up actually physically rooting for the main character, but even so I often found myself screaming at the screen and throwing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review126245">
        punches in the air because it was just that captivating.<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
<br />
The story is set around Makunouchi Ippo, a typical highschooler. He lives together with his Mom and help her with their Fishing Shop. He is bullied at school for not being able to join others since he has to help his Mom with the shop everyday. <br />
<br />
I found the story to be very captivating. It had a great plot and each episode ended with a cliffhanger leaving you wanting for more. The story is simple yet brilliantly made. Many other sport animes are easy to see through and you can almost predict what will happen next, and although that happens at certain points they know exactely when to turn the tables. <br />
<br />
The show switches easily from being about an intense Boxing Match to a hilarious turn of events usually ending up with Ippo getting toyed around with by his friends. <br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
<br />
The way characters are drawn is not the usual way but it&#039;s something you get used to quickly. Frankly, I&#039;m not sure if I would&#039;ve liked it any other way now that I think of it. <br />
<br />
Fights are well-animated, punches move fluently and often really gives the impression of how fast or strong of a punch it was. The animation overall is good, but fights are rather expectional. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
I am a huge fan of sound so this quickly becomes an important feature for me. The opening and ending were both great, the opening always set the mood for the upcoming fight and got your blood pumping even though the fight hadn&#039;t even started.<br />
<br />
The songs used in the background are well made and definitely gives you the right feeling to it. This anime is very good just through it&#039;s story and art but without the sound there would&#039;ve been something missing. On a sidenote: I felt the music used in the first season to be better than the ones in the 2nd and 3rd, although some tracks reappear in the 3rd anime (Hajime no Ippo: Rising)<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
<br />
Now this, this is what separates this anime from the rest. Every single character is well made and given a proper background. Some may argue that not all characters were wellrounded but I believe each and every one had their strengths and weaknesses - and the anime made sure you got to see both sides. Every single character was likeable in it&#039;s own way, and none was like the other - they all had their own little twist.<br />
<br />
This is something I rarely see: many boxers Ippo faced in the ring were actually given a proper background. Some even were so touching that you actually started having split thoughts about the fight, even rooting against the MC which is something I rarely see.<br />
<br />
Something I find very important for animes, especially long ones like this one is the character development. And I just have to say, it was absolutely amazing. A little spoiler alert on this part but it was so good that he became one of my favourite characters: Out of the three guys that bullied Ippo, one was the obvious leader, Umezawa Masahiko. He is a huge fan of boxing, and when he finds out Ippo gets a Pro Boxer license he actually starts becoming friends with Ippo. As he continues with his career  Umezawa eventually becomes his greatest fan and supports him in every fight. In the end he helps out Ippo with the fishing shop so that he has the chance to get the Featherwight World Championship belt. For me, the change Umezawa kun went through was absolutely amazing. It was well made and I couldn&#039;t help myself from starting to like him after a while - in the end he became one of my all time favourite characters. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
This anime was wonderful to watch, to the eye and to the heart. It was amazing to watch the intense fights and you couldn&#039;t help yourself but to cheer on Ippo when he was fighting.<br />
<br />
I think everyone would enjoy this anime greatly. It&#039;s a well-rounded anime but it has some unique differences to it that makes it stand out among the many others. I have absolutely no interest in sports whatsoever, and I loved the anime anyhow - so don&#039;t hesitate to watch it. I enjoyed it so much that I ended up finishing the whole series in just two days, and as soon as I was done I kept going with the second season and now I&#039;m watching the currently airing third season - It was that good.<br />
<br />
If you are not into the laid back style that Hajime no Ippo has this anime can be differently interpreted by some, but for the majority this will be an amazing find. <br />
<br />
Overall: 9.6/10 <br />
<br />
This anime is for everyone, it&#039;s a great anime that leaves you sitting at the edge of your chair wanting more episodes. 24 minutes ends up feeling like 5 and you&#039;ve suddenly watched 10 episodes in one go.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading my giant wall of text, hope it gave you an idea what this anime can offer!<br />

    There are plenty of stories about a young man finding some sort of passion and following it to some sort of logical conclusion, and Hajime no Ippo chooses not to stray from that basic idea very far. Luckily for original creator Morikawa George, not straying far from this premise seems to be the recipe for a successful comic that has lasted more than 1000 chapters week after week since its original Shounen Magazine publishing in 1989. This adaptation by Madhouse and director Nishimura Satoshi is longer than your usual TV anime run, at 75 episodes, but it doesn&#039;t quite cover the incredible length of Nishimura&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review110567">
        original comic. Instead, it opts for a sort complete story in itself, covering protagonist Makunouchi Ippo&#039;s career from its inception until his eventual championship.<br />
<br />
This works in the show&#039;s favor since, despite its length, not much time is wasted. The story progresses in a rather linear fashion from one fight to another, introducing Ippo&#039;s opponents one at a time and moving Ippo himself steadily up the ranks of a young boxer. However, since very little of the show is not about Ippo himself, the routine does become a bit stale quickly. By the second or third fight, it is already apparent what the formula Morikawa George is using consists of. Ippo&#039;s next enemy is stronger than his last, and he must somehow adapt to this, typically by learning some new technique. And when the fight itself comes, it all boils down to Ippo winning through his sheer tenacity - no matter what his opponents throw at him, he just doesn&#039;t give up, and you just know the spectators will feel the need to comment on his never ending stamina between every single round. In all truth, while simple, this is both tiring and unsatisfying, especially since Ippo&#039;s opponents are almost always significantly more interesting and endearing than Ippo himself. <br />
<br />
The narrative wants me to root for the hard working underdog Ippo, but it usually turns out that I want his opponent to win. This is because Ippo&#039;s enemies are fleshed out enough for the viewer to understand how they&#039;ve trained for this day and what is at stake for them. These are typically much more convincing arguments for their victory than Ippo&#039;s, who is new to the boxing world and is on the losing side of the fight until it eventually comes down to, once again, Ippo simply lasting longer than his opponent despite an overwhelming disadvantage. In particular, I found myself rooting for the Russian boxer Alexander Volg Zangief. The emotional weight of his fights and career was more powerful than anything Ippo ever managed to achieve.<br />
<br />
Ippo&#039;s romantic life is also given some focus, but it seems more like an afterthought. His romantic interest, Kumi Mashiba, is your typical ideal domestic housewife and devoted fan. Her relationship with Ippo begins with a quick meeting at a flower shop very early in the show and, despite their insistent tendency to meet frequently, it never really progresses very far.<br />
<br />
Regardless of Ippo&#039;s boring fights, there are moments of interesting boxing action. Specifically, the writing and choreography of the fights seem to become levels better when Ippo is not one of the participants. This shows in two places in the show - a short arc about Ichiro Miyata training in Mexico, and the subplot about Takamura Mamoru earning and defending his title. In both of these the viewer finds more complex characters and detailed, well-thought out fights that capitalize on everything their respective subplots have to offer. If only there was more of these sorts of fights and less of Ippo winning not because he deserves it but because he has to win somehow for the plot to progress.<br />
<br />
The animation is a real highlight of the show, at least during the fights. The camera feels loose and free, not restrained by the cheap but easy to animate single angles that usually plague TV anime. The boxers&#039; movements are accentuated by wind effects like they are kicking up dust every time they move, but it is used tastefully so that it only adds to the experience, something that can only be done reasonably in animation. Successful hits look painful, damage to the boxers accumulates as the fights go on. However, outside of fights, the animation becomes par for the course, though still not bad for an early 2000s TV anime. Madhouse pulled off a show that looks ahead of its time. The sounds are of similar quality, always tasteful and adding nicely to the experience.<br />
<br />
Hajime no Ippo has moments of brilliance, and it is rarely so extreme that it is unbelievable, but it is weighed down a great deal by a shallow and boring protagonist and a formualic progression.

    This is probably the best sports anime I&#039;ve seen (and I&#039;ve seen a bunch of them).  It isn&#039;t gorgeous visually and it isn&#039;t original and it isn&#039;t unpredictable... and I don&#039;t even like boxing.  But it&#039;s still really really entertaining to watch anyway.  And doesn&#039;t that say something?<br />
<br />
Yeah, yeah, it&#039;s got the standard &amp;quot;work hard, have confidence/courage and you&#039;ll overcome each seemingly-impossible hurdle one by one&amp;quot; type feel that a lot of anime does (see everything from DBZ, Naruto, Bleach, and to practically every sports anime out there...).  And I&#039;m sure there&#039;s people out there who are going to find the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review744">
        repetitive struggle-struggle-comeback pattern annoying...<br />
<br />
But if you like that sort of thing anyway (and don&#039;t we all sometimes?), this is definitely worth checking out.  Hajime&#039;s your prototypical earnest, hardworking, blue collar good guy who&#039;s trying to make himself better and, despite a serious lack of confidence, he&#039;s pretty likeable.<br />
<br />
What I really liked though was the chemistry and the interaction between the characters: the gruff, old cutman; the cocky champion; the teasing senpais; the thugs turned sidekicks... they all just made me laugh.  They were over the top,  leaned towards the ribald sometimes and semi-abusive, but it comes off as really charming... especially since you really got the feeling that Hajime really needed/wanted those sort of familiar, no-holds-barred friendships.  They tease each other and torment each other and it creates this really nice sense of playfulness that&#039;s underscored by a strong sense of loyalty and affection.<br />
<br />
So, if you&#039;d be interested in a good underdog story with a side dish of male bonding... look no further, Hajime no Ippo&#039;s just what you need. =)<br />

    Fantastic, Excellent, Superb! - Do not judge by its cover or genre. 10/10!<br />
<br />
My review will be kept spoiler free.<br />
<br />
Okay, so I know what most of you are probably thinking, &quot;an Anime about Boxing/Sports?! Ugh! Not for me&quot;. This would be an extremely bad judgement and you&#039;d miss out on one of the greater Anime&#039;s of our time. Whether you are or are not a sports fan, this shouldn&#039;t be missed. <br />
<br />
I myself am definitely NOT a sports fan, I am however a fight fan, in the respect of video games. For me, Boxing has always been a questionable sport. Its a sport where we as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review110995">
        people have allowed each other, to beat each other to an inch of our lives, its almost hilarious that as people we are happy with this, for me... This serves as a borderline between Sport and straight up violence, albeit very technical violence. So I was able to allow this to slide into my Anime viewings and have not looked back!<br />
<br />
Hajime no Ippo, a story about a young male Makanouchi Ippo who turns a bad scenario into an un-imaginable dream. The story of Hajime no Ippo is simple, its not the kind of story that needs a lot of thought, it&#039;s not hiding the fact that it is predictable or isn&#039;t completely unique, it definitely has elements of the shounen genre, BUT! For me it differed greatly from some of the more &quot;childish&quot; shounen out there... This isn&#039;t a flaw in the least, then you&#039;ve got your classic love stories, drama and comedy. For the most part, the story is very, very relatable to the movie Rocky and its sequels, If you are a fan of said movie then this is a no brainer to watch this series. If however you haven&#039;t seen Rocky or perhaps didn&#039;t like it that much, this is still going to be a great watch. Its the kind of story that will have you on the edge of your seat, it will leave you amped up and treating it as a real life event, you might even find yourself cheering out loudly (as was the case for myself). You will find yourself rooting for our protagonist but at the same time isn&#039;t going to make his opponents feel like useless side cast who all deserve to be defeated, in fact the show has an amazing way of actually making you feel like the opponents have equal rights to reap glory and you might even feel sympathy towards them, this serves to create a love-hate relationship with them which is rather spectacular. <br />
<br />
The Art for Hajime no Ippo could be a draw back for many as it is very 90&#039;s and perhaps even a little earlier, its very &quot;shouneny&quot;, however after a short while the art style becomes something that you&#039;ll appreciate and serves to highlight the ruggedness that comes with Boxing. <br />
<br />
The Music/Sound of Hajime no Ippo is actually rather excellent, particularly the first two Openings/Titles of the show. Victory themes play out perfectly and help raise the mood, punches, blocks, impacts are all well recreated and leave a lasting impression. Towards the end of the Anime, the music was a PERFECT accompaniment to the given outcome. All voice actors are perfectly matched for their roles and are totally believable.<br />
<br />
Characters are definitely the shows major attribute. All the characters are well developed and are unique from one another, whether they are friends or foes. Ippo the star of the show has now earned a spot in my favourite characters ever. The side cast are definitely not in the shadows, Takamura Mamoru is a deuteragonist, he certainly had me in stitches with all his antics, however his insights in the art of boxing are second to none and he KNOWS THIS VERY WELL! This is exactly what drives his ego through the roof and its hilarious to watch. Ippo and the members of Kamogawa Boxing Gym&#039;s coach (Kamogawa Genji) is a definite homage to the coach of Rocky Balboa from the movies, however in my eyes is way more well structured and thought out. I could talk forever about the cast, but take it from me, this is the highlight of the show.<br />
<br />
Overall the enjoyment of the show is extremely high, I found myself watching this show is large chunks not wanting to stop watching, but due to fatigue and having to go to say... I dunno, Sleep? Would be the only times I stopped. Fights are action packed, you may even shed a tear of joy! Emotions run wild in ways that I never thought imaginable from a genre that I may have missed, from Insights to the boxers feelings during fights to arduous training régimes everything is great! Needless to say, Hajime no Ippo deserves its top spot... Highly recommended.

    Hajime no Ippo is widely considered one the greatest if not the greatest sports anime ever made! The manga has been running since the 1980s, but it has managed to avoid feeling too stale or repetitive. Everyone simply can&#039;t get enough of this series! I will now try to explain what makes Hajime no Ippo so special to so many.<br />
<br />
Hajime no Ippo (which I will now refer to as HNI) starts off using the generic sports movie formula. It is about a troubled kid named Ippo, who is always getting bullied and is considered a loser and outcast at school. He comes from a poor

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178117">
        fishing family and smells like fish bait. One day he is getting his ass kicked by a group of bullies, when a boxing champ happens to pass by and save Ippo by chasing off the bullies. Inevitably, he becomes the wise mentor figure for Ippo and Ippo must train to become stronger and stand up for himself. HNI starts as basically the love child of The Karate Kid from 1984 and the Rocky series. However, HNI does FAR more than just rip off old movies that people have a nostalgic soft spot for. HNI actually has developed characters with realistic motivations. The fights are fun and the mangaka actually knows enough about boxing to make the series rather educational. Although the characters do still use &quot;finishing moves&quot; straight out of Street Fighter, so it doesn&#039;t try to be too serious or hyper-realistic. <br />
<br />
The only odd and confusing part of the writer&#039;s extensive boxing knowledge that he absolutely showers the viewer with is his raging boner for Jack Dempsey. Seriously? The guy that defended his title from a bunch of bums, was in the pocket of the Mafia, and refused to fight black boxers because he was too afraid he would get his ass kicked? THAT is your hero Mr. Morikawa? What about Robinson? Ali? Louis? Armstrong? Fuck Jack Dempsey! I like Wladimir Klitschko more than Dempsey! Wladimir may fight bum opponents and has a &quot;glass jaw&quot; but at least he doesn&#039;t shit his pants in terror when a black man enters the room! Wladimir would happily fight any of the past great heavyweights and even though he would get his ass whooped, he would have the fucking balls to fight because he isn&#039;t a pretentious coward! Ok, rant over.<br />
<br />
HNI manages to find a rare middle ground in anime. It isn&#039;t a cutesy &quot;moe&quot; that overflows with established anime tropes and cliche&#039;s. However, HNI  isn&#039;t DESPERATELY trying to win at the prestigious Cannes film festival and doesn&#039;t have a following of insufferable snobs that mostly don&#039;t even like it, but they say they do because they think it makes them sound smart. Unlike some other anime series I can think of. You know the ones. HNI manages to appeal to everyone from the basic casual to the seasoned elitist. It uses time honored story telling techniques, but also shows some innovation, fun, and heart. It is an all around good series and one that everyone should check out!<br />
<br />
Bonus section: SPOILERS AHEAD!<br />
<br />
One flaw that the series has that I find hilarious is that the writer unintentionally makes Ippo one of the greatest assholes in anime history! In order to make Ippo&#039;s opponents well balanced and not generic &quot;heels&quot;, the writer gives almost all of them far nobler reasons to compete than Ippo. Ippo just loves to fight, but he will be fighting against someone trying to win money for a needed operation or to save an orphanage! Even though Ippo cares only about the fighting and not the money, Ippo still never shares a red CENT of his prize money or endorsement money with any of the people that desperately need it. He let his good friend&#039;s mother DIE of preventable illness because he blew thousands of dollars on a party. What a fucking prick! Ippo is so cold he even gives Johan Liebert the chills! In Yugioh, Yugi gives the money from Duelist Kingdom to Joey so his sister can have an operation. Ippo would have laughed in Joey&#039;s face and spent the money at a strip club! Can you think of another anime hero that would be that selfish? Yusuke from Yu Yu Hakusho is SUPPOSED to be a selfish asshole and even he would have given up the money if Kuwabara needed it. Even anti-heroes are nicer than Ippo. Lucy from Elfen Lied has committed MASS MURDER against innocent civilians, but if she wasn&#039;t in a blind rage and was in her rational state of mind, she would give up all the money in the world for a close friend in need, because she has a warmer heart than Ippo and is a better human being! At least we get to see Alexander knock Ippo the FUCK out in season 2. Ippo deserved every bit of that and much more!<br />

    “There’s nothing to be scared of, because your penis is of heavyweight class.” – Takamura Mamoru <br />
<br />
Oops, sorry, wrong quote.<br />
<br />
“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts”. – Winston Churchill<br />
<br />
The English name for Hajime no Ippo is Fighting Spirit, and that’s what the show is about: Fighting spirit and the courage to keep on going. Hajime no Ippo was the first anime I discovered when I finally knew what anime was. It set a standard for the sports genre (which is in my opinion criminally underrated) in character development and pure enjoyment. This is my review.<br />
<br />
Contains Minor

          <span style="display: none;" id="review140803">
        Spoilers<br />
<br />
Story 8<br />
Hajime no Ippo follows a quiet teen named Ippo whose life just consists of going to school and helping his mother out with their fishing business. One day he’s beaten senseless by fellow school mates but is saved by a passer-by who happens to be a pro boxer. Ippo passes out and wakes up in a boxing gym to which he is tended to by the pro. He becomes fascinated with the sport and decides to become a pro boxer in order to become stronger. When I finished the first episode I thought the story was going to be “The Karate Kid with boxing”. Thankfully I was way off. Hajime no Ippo is about a boy’s goal to become stronger and his road towards the Lightweight championship. The story is really simple but enjoyable. It may not be original but the execution is well done.  You don’t need to understand or even enjoy boxing to enjoy Hajime. This is because the story is a nice set up for intense boxing action. Do you really need to understand the rules if you can just sit back and watch two guys pummel each other? The matches were superhuman and intense. The story contains some history on the sport which is a lot more interesting than dull. The story itself contained a lot of funny comedy bits, some drama which was well written and even a bit of romance.<br />
<br />
Characters 9<br />
The best thing about a good sports anime is the characters. Hajime no Ippo is no exception.  Ippo is a very likeable lead who the viewer wants to see succeed. His ambition and courage brings a smile to your face because you can’t help but to just love the guy. But Ippo isn’t the only character I loved. Every other major character is well written and you’ll be bound to have at least one favourite that’s from the supporting cast.  Fellow boxers in the show have devoted their lives to boxing and have their own reasons for fighting. Most of their causes are noble and a lot of times you’ll feel bad for when one of them loses a match. In between matches you don’t feel anxious or impatient to get to the next one because it’s actually enjoying to see what everyone’s lives are like and how they all rest up and train before and after matches. I laughed and cried with these characters, and they were definitely the best part of the show. <br />
<br />
Sound 7<br />
The sound of Hajime no Ippo is a mixed bag because the first OP gets you pumped for what’s about to follow and the ED closes the episode off nicely. After that the songs became terrible. Especially the OP’s and I usually just skipped past them (something I never did with the first). The voice acting was fantastic, especially with Ippo and Takamura although the other seiyuus did a fantastic job with their respective characters as well. The sound effects for the boxing was awesome. You’d get a chill down your spine when you hear bones break or blood splat. If the sound effects for the boxing wasn’t so fantastic I wouldn’t have enjoyed the matches so much. <br />
<br />
Art 10<br />
The art of Hajime really stands out because it has its own style. The character outlines are really thick black lines and it reminded me of Ashita no Joe but with less exaggerated features and a less retro style. The backgrounds were all right. Honestly I never really paid attention to it because my focus stayed on the characters. The animation used during boxing matches were very fluid and the action was really easy to follow. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8<br />
Honestly, I really enjoyed Hajime. The boxing matches had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, I loved all the characters and the adored the art. The only thing that disappointed me was the sound.  Please don’t be put off by the length of the anime. Those 76 episodes will fly by really quickly, and that probably won’t even be enough.<br />
<br />
Overall 8<br />
Hajime no Ippo was great. It was a fun watch and if I wasn’t so skinny I would have taken up the sport as a hobby. Be sure to check it out.<br />

    I like boxing now!<br />
<br />
I never really was a fan of boxing but I still knew some famous boxer such as Mike Tyson, Muhammed Ali and Robert Helenius (Very strong heavyweight Finnish Boxer with 29 wins and 3 losses) so I was really going in blind into this show. Well, mostly due to me seeing the fight between Kamogawa and Anderson. But all I can say it was worth the watch. If you have not seen this show and you are into fighting or boxing then this is the show for you. This show was a blast to watch and offers feels, epic action, good characters,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327288">
        good story and much much more. I watched this show in about 18 days.<br />
<br />
Story: We start our story with Makunouchi Ippo our mc helping her mom with work. After school he gets in trouble with some bullies and proceeds to take a beating. Our hero Takamura comes into rescue and scares the bullies, so Ippo wants to start boxing. It isn&#039;t so easy since he has to do a hard task beforehand. Very shortly we see Ippo already developing. After Ippo joins the gym he gets trained by Kamogawa, Aoki, Kimura and Takamura. Under their tutoring Ippo transforms into the ideal Boxer, even though he still has flaws. His first victory was against Miyata who is rumored child prodigy. So after ippo having enough age he gets his boxing licence. We get a rookie tournament with a lot of hype moments and fights. Also a lot of good rivals for Ippo such as Volg, Mashiba and Sendo. More on them later. After Ippo becoming a rookie of the year he wants to become the featherweight champion but that is a hard task. We see more epic training and epic fights while Ippo is getting closer to his goal. <br />
<br />
Characters: Makunouchi Ippo is a wimpy kid at the beginning since he is afraid to punch people and he never has punched anyone even though he is fully capable of doing so and his strength is beyond human. Even when becoming a professional boxer he still acts very nervous around other fighters and is very nice person overall. Mamoru Takamura is Ippos inspiration to become a boxer. He is the middleweight champion and strives to become the world champion but it will probably happen in the later seasons. He is very strong as expected. His personality is very prideful and he acts very mean towards his fellow boxers such as Kimura, Ippo and Aoki but I think in a more of a playful way. Kimura is one of Ippos tutors and he is Aokis best friend... I think. He is very helpful person. He still acts kinda mean towards his friends like every character besides Ippo, but again in a playful way. He is probably weaker than Ippo at this point in time. Aoki is again a tutor and a friend of Ippos. He fights very weirdly since he is very unpredictable. He is a part-timer at a ramen shop since boxing is expensive. He also has terrible taste in women. He is a very funny character and probably is the comic relief character. Kamogawa is an ex boxer and the owner of the boxing gym Ippo goes to. He knows how to teach and is very active in Ippos training. Volg is a russian boxer titled &quot;the wolf&quot; which is very fitting. He prioritizes strength before anything else. He mostly overpowers his enemies and he is dangerous. Mashiba is Ippos second rival after beating him during the rookie champion finals. Mashiba looks very scary and intimidating. He specializes in flicker jab and the hitman style. He hates Ippo with all his heart. Also he is the older brother of Kumi which is Ippos crush.  Sendo has a very prideful personality and was born very strong. He wanted to fight Ippo a lot and he got his wish. The last fight of the season was Sendo vs Ippo rematch which was epic as hell. Sendo can adapt into situations very well and he outspirits almost all fighters. His dream is to crush Ippo. <br />
<br />
The Soundtrack of this show is beyond nice. There are a lot of good parts of the ost and they all fit very nicely into the show. The openings were cool visually and musically. They all had cool visuals and banger songs. Still the first opening is my favourite and we do hear the first opening play in the background in some fights. <br />
<br />
I never believed I would enjoy boxing this much but I do. This has been an adventure of cool fights and such. If you enjoy action and have few days to spare I recommend to watch this show.

    Ippo Makunouchi... the most evil villain who ever lived.<br />
<br />
This anime is perfect. If not perfect, then damn near close. It&#039;s easy to be skeptical, sounds ridiculous, I know. Over 70 episodes and still gets straight tens? Well believe it, it&#039;s real. The sounds and music are epic, memorable, and perfectly on point. The art mixed with the sounds gives real weight to the punches. The characters are nearly all unforgettable and unique. Lastly, the story is so well put together and balanced that I frequently reminisce about the first episode, decide to watch it, and the next thing I know I&#039;ve re-watched the whole series.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178820">
        <br />
<br />
Everyone should know what Hajime no Ippo is all about by now. That said, this is my fourth time watching it, and I have developed a bit of a different take on the series. Prepare for a plot summary review of Hajime no Ippo: the story of the rise of the greatest villain in anime history.<br />
<br />
*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br />
<br />
This is the story of Ippo Makunouchi, a second year high school student who has been bullied for his entire life. Downtrodden to the point where his biggest wish is to know what it feels like to be strong. Then one day he finds his chance when he is introduced to the world of boxing.<br />
<br />
He starts off his career strong, by breaking the spirit of a kid who has been training his entire life. Ippo comes in as a complete amateur and wallops him. Defeats him, ultimately surpasses him, and forces him out of the country. Effectively starting a lifelong rivalry that he isn&#039;t even fully aware of. Watch Ippo as he moves on to bigger and better things, destroying boxers one by one. Crushing the actual dreams of others so that he may further his dream of being strong and having fun boxing. <br />
<br />
Watch as a humble soldier comes to Tokyo to win money to repay his impoverished Japanese second family for all they have done for him, only to be trounced by Ippo and sent back with nothing. Marvel at Ippo&#039;s tenacity as he wins the Eastern Rookie Tournament by destroying a man&#039;s only hope of making a decent living and paying for his sister&#039;s college tuition after their parent&#039;s died in a terrible accident, then prepare for your heart to be set aflutter when Ippo later decides he wants to bang that opponent&#039;s aforementioned sister. See the exciting clash of the East and West Rookie Champions as Ippo travels all the way to Osaka to flatten the region&#039;s hero and make little children cry. Cheer for Ippo as he faces down and ultimately defeats his toughest opponent yet, a Russian national who detests violence but fights against all odds so that he may afford to nurse his sick mother back to health. All of these fights are just stepping stones, though. Merely checkpoints along the road to his ultimate goal: Facing a man who lost his dreams, his unborn child, and the respect of his wife... in an attempt to take away his title belt and, with it, his pride. <br />
<br />
All because it fills him with joy. All because for him, it is fun. He has found that it is what he wants to do in his life more than anything else. And because he feels like the crushed dreams of the people he has defeated are now carried in his fists, making him stronger.

    Hajime no Ippo is a series that was very inspiring to me.<br />
<br />
The plot begins with a regular, average high school student that&#039;s just trying to get through with life and school while trying to help out his mom with their family-owned business. Almost everyday, punks in school always bullies him after school. That changed one day when a pro-boxer came and saved him from receiving more punches and kicks from these punks. From that, Ippo (the main character) strives to become a pro-boxer just like that guy. He suddenly becomes motivated to be a boxer in the future. Throughout this series, he constantly trains and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11612">
        do &#039;roadwork&#039; in order to maintain his physical strength and stamina. Every now and then, a boxer from a different gym (or a different country) arrives and challenges Ippo to a match. So all those &#039;roadwork&#039; really does help out alot. The story is great, which fulfills what I think a sports anime should be in the first place. It basically explains how anyone can achieve their goals by working hard to get it.<br />
<br />
The art on this one was also different from the typical anime that I&#039;ve seen. The world on Hajime no Ippo rotates around the boxing gym where Ippo and the crew trains, his house where their family-owned business is also located, and the boxing ring itself. The thing that I can say right off the bat are the FIGHTS themselves. How awesome was it when I see smoke coming out behind the back of the boxer that just got owned by a gut punch? VERY. It&#039;s like watching an atomic bomb go off several times, but this time behind someone&#039;s back. Seeing their faces get pounded is also something, and you might start thinking that I&#039;m a sadist (hey it&#039;s boxing, that&#039;s what it&#039;s about). Every fight on this show was really exciting to watch, and the animators also did a great job putting detailed environments. Hajime no Ippo have that old-school feel to it where the city is one that&#039;s just any other one, except that it has the boxing gym and the stadium where all hell breaks loose. Another thing that really caught my attention was the huge setting sun behind Ippo, which shows how determined this guy is on becoming what he wants to be, a better boxer.<br />
<br />
The three opening songs on this series were all great, and somewhat hilarious too. Understar always makes me laugh for some reason. Inner light, on the other hand, is really one that&#039;s inspiring. That&#039;s what I listen to everytime I do my own &#039;roadwork&#039; running around the neighborhood. &#039;Tumbling Dice&#039; was also great, even though it didn&#039;t really have lyrics accompanying it. The ending music were also great. I have to say that they were also good ones. Now, with the voice actors... Ippo&#039;s voice is really something. His verbal stutters every now and then is really funny. It&#039;s like he&#039;s always unsure about what he&#039;s doing. The voice acting really did a nice job in Hajime no Ippo. Kohei did a very nice job with Ippo&#039;s voice, that&#039;s for sure. Takamura&#039;s voice along with the rest of the crew were also good, and had the humor in them. Even the drumroll that separates the first half of the show to the last half was something that&#039;s worth mentioning. Those electric guitar parts where Ippo&#039;s pumped up about the next fight are also great. The sound effects comes just at the right time.<br />
<br />
And then there are the characters... Hajime no Ippo is composed of people that varies in personalities. Maybe all animes have those also, but this series really emphasizes on each one&#039;s character. Mashiba is this scary-looking guy that always seem to scare Ippo in every way and every time he thinks about him. There&#039;s Takamura and his over-confidence about himself that makes him the &#039;boss&#039; of the gym. Ippo himself portrays an average guy that leads a simple life. His funny actions and wimpy attitude changes drastically ones he&#039;s on the ring. His true strength really shows in that ring, while outside, he&#039;s a very humble person. He doesn&#039;t show off like other people would (Takamura, yea you!). All of the characters in this series are really memorable. One just can&#039;t forget about them.<br />
<br />
With all the excitement that this show offers makes the enjoyment of watching it over the top. After each fight, I would anticipate to see the next fight even before a new challenger (notice the pun for the new season here hehe) appears again. Even when the crew is not fighting, just doing roadwork, it&#039;s really fun to watch. It really motivated me to run myself. I usually enjoy playing basketball at the park, but when I watched and finished this show, I even started to have fun running as well. Seeing my little sister doing jump ropes, I borrowed it from her so I can try it out too. Hajime no Ippo really made me like new stuff that I would just ignore in the past. That jump rope is an example. <br />
<br />
In the end, this show is really worth watching. 76 episodes seemed long at first when I started it, but all 76, movie, and an OVA went by as if it was just a 12-episode show. It makes me wanting more. The new season is out, so I have something to be busy over again. Hajime no Ippo is something I would recommend to sports enthusiasts, as well as people that are into action animes. This show will surely deliver punches that will make you stand up just so you can also cheer for Ippo as he tries to climb to the top!

    so...............lets talk about HAJIME NO IPPO(fighting spirit)<br />
Its like other shows, a very cliche sad, always bullied MC with huge untapped potential (and in this case it was his strength).<br />
its a magnificiant king size series with glamorous journey of many altheles(boxers) and the their peas in a pod who supported them in every single way possible and made them who they are.<br />
this show mainly focuses on qualities like determination, benevolence , pride , respect and gratitude , training , preaching positivity etc. which might sound like pretty cliche like other shonen animes and it reality its very similar to that in that regard but the way

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401362">
        they potray this this whole continental seies of developments just leaves everyone with their mouths wide open.<br />
this is not just about people throwing punches and beating others to blue black pulp in the ring but also the training which makes them strong enough to compete in the professional ring.<br />
training trainig training training trainig is what is making real boxers here and its not just their blind luck and natrual talent like rest of cliche shows.<br />
its a real masterpiece work which develops a human being from scratch and uplifting him to heavens to mark its valor and the reward here is mainly at an subconscioius state rather than finding the worth in materilaistic things.<br />
story     6/10<br />
<br />
there s not much in thier stroy. its just like other shonen flow of story(like their is a desire to become strong and after developing skills they  become strong but that is just their first step and have to work harder in order to become best).<br />
even if their story doesnt pack that of a great punch to our consciousness but the factor just balances and even improves it a whole lot.<br />
<br />
art  7/10<br />
<br />
the art initially isnt that good to watch but as the story progresses, the eyes becomes habituated to the sight and cant sway it from that epic adventure and starts to really appreciate it right down to its core.<br />
its art not that flashy like other shonen which is like a blessing in disguise bacause it then sticks to ground level reality and focuses more on the boxing match and provides soothing effect to our eyes and conquer us with thier fluid art motions with great shadowing effects and sometimes bizzare captivating scenes.<br />
imo madhouse didnt hold back on anything while making this magnum opus<br />
<br />
sound  9/10<br />
<br />
the sound effects is the one thing which totally mattches with the weird yet bold art style of theirs and provides life to the dead scenes which provides more crisp to the world of boxing in which they live on.<br />
those SFX provides enough linking which makes us feel like we re part of the background cast itself and enjoying their world with them.<br />
<br />
character   11/10<br />
<br />
there s an old saying that characters brings life to the show and its true in every single aspect for this gallant show. the show introduces us with the variety of characters which are crunchy from outside but savory from inside and brings melody to their conversation and various situation. its a comedy show mainly because of every single character and provides us with a share of entertainment in thier own way. they are able to find happiness in thier path and make it as their goal and with just passage of time , leaks to their surrounding and brings the environment to that of a sunflower garden.<br />
<br />
<br />
enjoyment  10/10<br />
<br />
hajime no ippo is the true defination of enjoyment which tackles with every single hardships and make it worth fortune.<br />
it an whole another level in terms of enjoyment and bring us at an elevation of mutual understanding with the motto of this series and even inspires us to take our own first step in life and make it a suceess with childish happiness as their chackpoint.<br />
and the end of this 75 epsiodes is just the beginnig of a more sweet and zealous full of savory journey because its just the more otherworldly replica of our life and we all know that this life is not too short to enjoy this delicacy.<br />
<br />
overall   10/10<br />
<br />
the journey which it presents us have some minor as well as major flaws but has its own massive story with a pure success and sheds light to the actual world where we live in with all the struggles and hope tucked with us and an attempt to prove our own worth.<br />
we can feel more connected with these who live thier own life based on their own principles and make us appreciate their way and getting inspired from it and taking actions based on that in real life.<br />
a weak yet powerful mian protaognaist , a talented yet emotional teacher , worthless but fun to be with friends , mature yet competetive rivals , unreliable yet responsible at times disciples and finally a super strong yet boastfully cocky senior who overwhelms others with his might but even then becomes our source of motivation and a goal to achieve who understands us and porvides us with eternal blissful guidelines and paths to follow which leads us to our own beneficiary results. but sometimes this senior can pull our pants and make fun of us but from deep down his heart never hopes for our destruction.<br />
also, this series not just focuses on boxing match but also on to its journey and path of developments which leads to the match in a ring and vitalizes the interaction with the opponents and make it an interesting turn of events which at the end glorifies the sport and its sportmanship.

    Rather than try to review a ton of aspects of a 76 episode show, I want to give a few specific criticisms.<br />
<br />
My biggest criticism is on sound, or specifically the obvious replication of Trigun&#039;s drippy, dramatic, and perfectly fitting music in a place that it does not belong at all and is utterly disruptive, leaving any scene with it utterly bereft of its intended impact. The music in this series is fine when it is just bitchin&#039; guitar solos, and at its best when it reinterprets the Rocky theme, but it is at its absolute worse when it mistakenly transplants Trigun&#039;s music.<br />
<br />
My second criticism iis

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17285">
        that the way they shoot to the audience at fight climaxes or whatever is supposed to be an especially exciting part is extremely disruptive, especially in early fights. It inflates the time that each fight takes, reduces the tension and excitement, and can serve no possible purpose but to help dumb viewers realize &quot;oh, so now I should be excited again, okay!!&quot; I do not mean when they flash to trainers or the members of the gym for analysis of the matches, since that is genuinely useful, but just the roars of the audience. It gets better in later matches (as in not happening), but then does come back again.<br />
<br />
A third criticism on a similar subject is where, in early scenes, they extremely blurred both the top and bottom of parts of fights to show THERE IS SO MUCH ACTION GOING ON! They finally learned their lesson, but it was really disruptive in the early stages of the series.<br />
<br />
Finally, a more plot related implement, still for the fighting, is that they repeatedly rely on Ippo being the one specifically shorted by the gong ringing, not the opponent, in an attempt to add tension by making Ippo the comeback kid over and over.<br />
<br />
I think it is nice that they do try very much to make you care about and root for all characters, even though it is obvious that Ippo is the one that you are supposed to like most, and I like the time they spend on each character even though I did not like a lot of them (especially not Ippo&#039;s oh so shy routine).<br />
<br />
Obviously, this series is enjoyable and generally well produced and paced. I think that it is quite overrated, especially because of the flaws I pointed out, so I just wanted to give people something to keep their expectations realistic, since this is not a &quot;best anime ever,&quot; not even a great one, merely a good one.

    Have you ever watched an Anime where watching each episode made you so excited that you couldn&#039;t help but jump around like a maniac? Yeah, Hajime no Ippo did that to me. Don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever been filled with so much energy as I have with this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story(9/10): Our main character, 16 year old Makunouchi Ippo has been bullied for as long as he can remember. One day while he was getting beat up by his high school bullies, comes along a boxer called Takamura, who saves him from the bullies. Takamura then proceeds to take him to the gym where he trains, and from here

          <span style="display: none;" id="review170633">
        on out begins Ippo&#039;s glorious journey in the field of boxing.<br />
What I really liked about the story was that the passage of time is realistic, no timeleaps or anything. We see Ippo&#039;s determination in getting better through countless hours of running, practising in the gym, shadow boxing and sparring, which is his daily routine. From first spar match to him getting his boxing license and then finally becoming a pro boxer, we get to see him grow as a boxer right before our eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art(9/10): The art for its time is pretty damn good. Sure, the faces sometimes look odd, and sometimes the hand and movement animation seem plastic, but those are just small little things.<br />
The Animation shines during a fight. You can feel the impact of each blow as they land on target, gradual sweating throughout the matches, realistic wounds and so on. The newer seasons clean up the Animation by quite a bit, but the general feel stays the same as from this season.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound(9/10): I have no complaints in the sound department. Various sound effects from punching, blocking and running are done to near perfection. The voice actors also did a splendid job in giving a soul to each of the characters. As for the OPs and EDs, they&#039;re mostly good.<br />
My favourites being &#039;&#039;Under Star&#039;&#039; and &#039;&#039;Yuuzora no Kamihikouki&#039;&#039;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters(10/10): The main reason why I love this Anime so much. Each and every single character has great backstory behind them and you can&#039;t help but root for them. Each fight being tougher than the last, it&#039;s hard not to cheer for Ippo when he perseveres.<br />
My favourite character other than Ippo is definitely Takamura. He&#039;s brash, arrogant, a pervert. But damn, he&#039;s a genius in the ring. There wasn&#039;t a single moment where I wasn&#039;t astounded by his brute strength in the ring. Aside from him, I love Aoki and Kimura a lot too. They&#039;re Ippo&#039;s senior but they&#039;re good in their own right. They also provide for the comedic relief in the Anime, especially Aoki(can&#039;t beat the Frog Punch!). Ippo&#039;s coach, Kamogawa, who is the owner of the gym deserves special mention as well. He&#039;s a veteran and highly likable, and makes sure everyone does their training regularly. Finally, each opponent of Ippo are really likable. My favourite being Sendo and Vorg. His fights with both of them are the best of the whole series.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(10/10): I haven&#039;t enjoyed an Anime this much in long, long time. I honestly can&#039;t really find faults in it. Right from the get go, it caught hold of me by the collar and never let to. I was subjected to a roller coaster ride of emotions and great action. In short, I LOVE IT!<br />
<br />
Overall(10/10): If you haven&#039;t watched this Anime already, then WATCH IT! This Anime is so good, that it&#039;ll be a shame if you haven&#039;t watched it. Definitely one of the best Anime I have ever seen and honestly, in the Sports genre, I doubt anything can top it.<br />

    *THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS*<br />
<br />
Before I start this review, I would like to clarify that this is my first anime review, so i apologize if it isn&#039;t good.<br />
<br />
Hajime no Ippo is a underdog story about a student named Ippo who works at his family fishing business in his spare time . Ippo is constantly bullied relentlessly by bullies at his school. One day after school, Ippo is being beaten up by bullies under a bridge. A mysterious passerby notices this and stops the bullying in a stylish way. Ippo who is injured after being beat up becomes unconscious. <br />
<br />
He then wakes up in an environment

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410358">
        where he has never been before, a boxing gym. Seeing everything around him Ippo is amazed, and tries punching a punching bag. The mysterious man who is actually a boxer at the gym is in awe along with the other boxers at Ippo&#039;s strength, and Ippo&#039;s love for boxing starts from here.<br />
<br />
Hajime no Ippo is an incredible story with an unforgettable cast of characters who all shine in their own way and are very likeable. Even if you do not like boxing (how i felt before watching this), i would still recommend giving this series a try as it has everything you would want from an anime. A great set of characters, comedy, an incredible plot and much more. <br />
<br />
Every Episode has its own charms and they show why a lot of anime fans consider Hajime no Ippo to be among the greatest.<br />
<br />
I would consider Hajime no Ippo to be one of the greatest anime/manga to come out since it ticks all the boxes of what is considered a great anime. The manga is still ongoing with 1300+ chapters, so there is plenty of content to be read even after finishing the anime!<br />

    Hajime No Ippo is the true definition of a masterpiece.<br />
<br />
What makes it a masterpiece? Well, the story is impeccable, the animation is fabulous (This Show was done during the prime Madhouse Era), the opening/ost is glorious, the characters are endearing, and lastly, it&#039;s a long-running anime that is done right.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
It&#039;s pretty straightforward. It&#039;s about a young man who had a hard upbringing in life and was able to find his calling when he comes across a professional boxer.<br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t have any knowledge of how the sport of boxing works. No need to worry. Thankfully Hajime No Ippo gives an extremely detailed outline on how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406634">
        you start your journey and how to properly climb up the ranks and gives a simulator experience on how fighters operate during the day of their fight and show the harsh reality of making weight before fights.<br />
<br />
Sound Track/ OST<br />
<br />
Straightforward, each opening is a banger. This is the black clover of openings back in the day.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
This is where the show shines. Every character has a purpose. Each character has something to fight for and will do anything in their power to make their lives better. Some will face tragedy, some will face loss and heartbreak, and some will be able to accomplish their dreams. <br />
<br />
One of the biggest flaws of most animes released during this era 1990-2010, is the comedy. It&#039;s too forced and ruins the chemistry of the characters, it doesn&#039;t feel natural, and feels out of place. Hajime No Ippo does the comedy Justice. This is what you call comedy Gold. If you like Golden Boy, then you will love the comedy in Hajime No Ippo. The comedy is based on adult humor, which makes it the perfect choice for this type of show.<br />
<br />
Romance<br />
<br />
I know some people out there like to have romance in their shows. Well, you&#039;re in luck, there is in fact romance. It&#039;s not the major focal point of the show, but it&#039;s there. The romance is done justice for all characters.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
Hajime No Ippo is truly a Masterpiece. It has everything that anime watchers want to have in their shows. You won&#039;t be disappointed.

    Hajime No Ippo Review Review <br />
There are no spoilers in this review <br />
Never have I ever thought that I could find an anime which has ever got me as pumped up as my personal favourite, Initial D. But it&#039;s happened. Hajime No Ippo impressed me greatly and got me so pumped up for a sport I had no interest in. I&#039;ve come out of it with a respect for fighting athletes of all sports. I think highly of this. <br />
<br />
Story <br />
The story is pretty average once you think about it. A rise to the top from someone unexpected. It&#039;s important to make such a person

          <span style="display: none;" id="review99989">
        likeable otherwise people will despise him and his ideals. I have to say they really hit the nail on the head with Makunouchi. A really charismatic character in his own way. They really focused on what was important and that was Makunouchi&#039;s fighting spirit. <br />
<br />
This coupled with some of the most cringe worthy humor and romance and great fighting scenes made for a blood pumping anime that could get any testosterone driven male excited. It&#039;s a simple formula but effective. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m glad I took a chance on watching it. It was well worth the time. <br />
<br />
Tech <br />
With a badass opening sequence and a classic artstyle I love Hajime No Ippo&#039;s tech side really appealed to me. The older style visuals are something I greatly enjoy. The visual quality was superb, the animation was smooth and the audio wasn&#039;t bad. Some of the sound effects were lame but the music made up for it and created the atmosphere well for the fights. Good visuals and audio complement the story and the characters well and served great to their purposes. <br />
<br />
Characters <br />
The characters were all well done. Some of the designs impressed me greatly. I was disappointed with some of the females. Allot of the females in the show looked similar to each other. Maybe that&#039;s more realistic or not, who knows? <br />
As to the fighters of the show, they all were interesting to see. From the point fighter Kenta to the hard hitting Ryo there was no shortage of variety. DIfferent styles, different strengths, different appearances, different levels of intimidation each character made each fight more interesting. I think this was one of the stronger points of Hajime No Ippo. <br />
<br />
Conclusion <br />
Not much else to be said other then if you&#039;re willing, give it a try. You might be surprised. I found myself unable to stop watching it after I saw episode 1. It did well to keep me hooked. It&#039;s a bit long and you won&#039;t be able to get it all in one sitting but if you like it, you will just speed through it. <br />
The last fight of the show was absolutely amazing. <br />
<br />
Score 10/10 <br />

    Animation - 5<br />
I absolutely hate the character design of this show. So unappealing, Hajime no Ippo was an eyesore, and honestly painful to watch the faces of the characters speak, cry, get excited or display any type of emotion. However I will give credit to the rendering of bodies and musculature and especially differentiating characters body types. The quality of animation clearly increases as the episodes go by so that, by the end there was much more polish overall in the quality. This is most notable in boxing matches.<br />
Sound - 7<br />
Hajime no Ippo had a passable foley effects and music. The first opening to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10163">
        show was quite catchy and set a good tone for the show. Voice acting was pretty good. There were many variations in color and tone of the actors, and all had a good grasp of what was given.<br />
Characters - 6<br />
Pretty average characters and archetypes of shounen anime are present here. Some are well done, while others are wooden, and maybe offensively sterotypical/two-dimensional. Miyata was a standout character.<br />
Story - 5<br />
Very mediocre story. If you have seen other shounen anime, Rocky movies, or even those generic once a year &amp;quot;see how this team of ragtag individuals beat the odds and triumph&amp;quot; sports movies, you&#039;ll know how this plays out, who the viewer is supposed to feel sorry for, and who we&#039;re supposed to root for. The problem is the show didn&#039;t do a good job of making us feel for any of these characters outside of the ring with the exception of the few romantic elements. I will say the first few fights are scripeted well, but the quickly become formulaic. <br />
Enjoyment - 7<br />
Hajime no Ippo is an average shounen anime that doesn&#039;t do much different besides its presentation. The show excels when inside of the ring and production values are high, and with a character like Miyata (though kind of shafted off to the side towards the end) great potential, and sometimes originality is displayed.<br />
<br />
Overall, Hajime no Ippo gets a 7/10 from me.
