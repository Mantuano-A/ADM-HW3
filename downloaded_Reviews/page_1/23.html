    There&#039;s action, there&#039;s mystery, there&#039;s this captivating concept of time travel. <br />
<br />
It draws me in so much just in the first episode that im just dumbfounded. Its cleverly crafted mysteries don&#039;t lack anything: it keeps me curious, and always somehow end up catching me off guard. It&#039;s a donghua capable of tears too, and isn&#039;t emotionally lacking either. <br />
<br />
Well, to start off, it’s the first thing you notice about this donghua: the art. It’s refreshing unique art style I can’t find anywhere else. It gives me a new sense of originality that’s important in these animes and donghuas, in both story and art.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407536">
        for smart characters (ex. The Promised Neverland) with crafty plans then this is a good add to your watches. <br />
<br />
This has one of the few OP/EDs that I actually don&#039;t skip (unless I&#039;m urgent due to cliffhangers) they have a unique opening and the endings are always somewhat chilly as it ends on the iconic ED beats. <br />
<br />
The only upsetting thing I can find in this donghua is their excessive use of cliffhangers that keep me on the edge.<br />
<br />
So basically (TLDR): if you like a suspenseful, exciting, brilliantly planned donghua, you&#039;ll like LINK CLICK.

    While it was airing, Shiguang Dailiren was considered the hidden gem of Spring 2021 by many fans. Now, with its strong finale and its pass to a second season, its insane rise in score and its entry to MAL&#039;s top 25 anime will make more people watch it and discuss it. But is it really worth the hype?<br />
<br />
First of all, let&#039;s state the obvious and answer this question to a certain audience. People with an interest in non sci-fi time traveling shows could easily enjoy this. Flashy and with style, the protagonists use photographs to enter a past moment of the same world&#039;s timeline, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407657">
        control others&#039; bodies and minds there for a few hours with their main objective being the solution of criminal cases. Using that power, they must be careful not to change the flow of events because the butterfly effect may lead the world to a completely different future. How do they handle situations like these?<br />
<br />
Well, Cheng Xiaoshi&#039;s character is heavily inspired by the mad scientist from Steins;Gate, Okabe Rintarou. In his &quot;diving operations&quot;, he gets emotional when he faces hardships and he feels the urge to help other people. He never puts the blame in others and tries to take full responsibility, and that&#039;s what could make him a tragic character or... a hero. His partner, Lu Guang is more grounded and that makes sense because he is an observer when they use their special power. Sadly, in these 11 episodes all the other characters are shallow and forgettable, so in the end, only Cheng matters.<br />
The dialogue and character interactions are a big minus in this show. There&#039;s sometimes fan service, while at times there are just tragic events happening and people acting immaturely. Of course, not everyone views this as a flaw.<br />
<br />
The animation and art show almost no similarity to those of common anime, and that&#039;s because Shiguang Dailiren is a donghua. Their style is closer to a live webtoon than a japanese anime. As for the soundtrack, it&#039;s a good reason to watch the show; the beautiful and romantic opening song, the dynamic and mysterious ending song that makes you want to watch more, but most of the insert songs too; all of them are praiseworthy.<br />
<br />
In my point of view, to really answer the question I set in my prologue, Link Click is neither innovative nor brilliant. Its selling points are either easy to use or already popular in fiction: simple time travel with no sci-fi approach, a compassionate main character, simple life lessons and morals that say no to greed, attractive looking characters and shallow drama that stems from bad life choices. It&#039;s like a failed attempt to make a crossover of Sherlock Holmes and Steins;Gate.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading.

    Holy. Fucking. Shit. This jewel of a show is buried underneath all of the other great anime that have come out this spring season, but it&#039;s definitely one of the best, standing with Vivy and 86. <br />
<br />
The concept of time travel done through photographs is so fresh compared to all the other usual types that we see in media. The story is outstanding, to say the least, and I can&#039;t believe I almost missing this from my hesitation of it being a Chinese anime - I don&#039;t know the proper term. <br />
<br />
But I am so glad I took the leap and boy has this set

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407543">
        the standard! The art style is pretty good, it matches the style of the show and doesn&#039;t distract from the story being told here.  It compliments it so well and I would totally wear the characters&#039; outfit choices, they&#039;re very trendy.<br />
<br />
While I personally don&#039;t really like the OP - I find it kinda cringey - the animation showcases the talent that is behind the scenes, it&#039;s so fluid, it&#039;s as if they rotoscoped it or something cause I can&#039;t believe how smooth it is. The ED is fucking FIRE! I love EDM music and as soon as I heard it I wanted the song on my phone and listen to it on repeat for a few days. <br />
<br />
This show NEEDS to be promoted more cause it&#039;s truly a shame that only a few curious people will watch it and it is overshadowed by other better-marketed shows. The word needs to spread that Link Click is fantastic and Season 2 needs to come out like right now!

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#039;s no guarantee, I can get a prefect ending.&quot;-Xiaoshi Cheng<br />
This will be forever the hidden gem of this year<br />
<br />
This show is incredible, a masterpiece even. If you want a show that gives you some good shock value then this show is prefect for you. This show has changed my mind about donghua in general. So lets dive into why this show deserves more attention and why the ratings are so high.<br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
The story is something you cant explain, its something you have to show. So if you haven&#039;t already watched it, plz do. I might not understand how some parts of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407557">
        plot works but that&#039;s okay. The shock value of this donghua is insane, if you thought the promised neverland 1st ep is shocking then imagine if ever ep of this donghua is like the first ep of The promised neverland. The show has shocked me multiple times, just as I think its gonna be alright, it does a 180 on me. But if you want me to explain the general plot of this show then it would be 2 hot boys have a time traveling power by having photos, one looks like Gojo, the other looks like Gojo with black hair. The power basically allows black hair Gojo to become the person that took the photo. They use this power to help people fix there &quot;mistakes&quot;, however this isnt always the case, black hair Gojo always mess things up and things turn out really badly. The planning of the show is amazing, there is no time wasted. With only 11 ep, they told a story that some anime would&#039;ve taken up at least over 100 ep. This show had some of the best planning I seen since One piece, stuff that was done at ep 1 would appear at the last ep. It all &quot;Links&quot; up! and &quot;Click&quot; so well. Ok I should probably stop with the puns ( ͡° ᴥ ͡°)<br />
<br />
Art and Sound: 8<br />
What can I say, its very good. Its refreshing to see something that isn&#039;t the typically AnImU style. The sound fits the situations in the show, The opening and endings are all bangers , the ending song of the show is my fav ending song ever now. It reminds me if sherlock holmes was an anime or something XD.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
Fantastic Characters all around, there isn&#039;t a character i hate yet? but lets wait for a season 2 if its gonna even have one (Hoping its not gonna look like The promised neverland 2nd season) As I said I love every one of the main characters, my fav character would have to be Gojo 2.0 bc he is just so calm and I just hope he doesn&#039;t die or somethi-<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and Overall: 10 and 9<br />
I really enjoyed it, if you havent checked it out already, plz do so bc you wont regret it. Honestly pulling this out with the span of 11 ep is incredible, yet it didn&#039;t feel fast. This will be a hidden gem of 2021, I know a lot of people have been saying Odd taxi is. But how can something be a hidden gem if everybody is saying its the hidden gem!<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though there are times we find ourselves in darkness...eventually we will meet people who shines their light on us&quot; - a message to the people who finish reading this review.<br />
Thanks for your feedback!

    Spoiler-Free review of episodes 1-4 :)<br />
<br />
Where to begin... This show has become the bane of my existence.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d put the story and art at a high 9. The main/background plot is very entertaining and creative, but there are a few dry spots every now and then. I&#039;m mainly referring to episode 4, however, that was made up for by a reveal near the end of the episode that helped us understand Cheng Xiaoshi&#039;s character much more. The premise is amazing, and super engaging~<br />
<br />
The art style is great and I really enjoy it! However, it&#039;s not quite as smooth at times as &quot;regular&quot; animation/art style, so it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397929">
        may not be for everyone.<br />
<br />
The op and ed are both absolute bangers and I rewatch/listen to them all the time~<br />
On top of that, the lyrics of both hint at and foreshadow something much deeper and/or possibly darker later on in the show. This was made a little more obvious with the ending scenes of the first episode.<br />
The music and sound effects used in the show are also stellar and really immerse you in the show! I especially love the sound effect used whenever Cheng Xiaoshi enters a photo and says &quot;Dive.&quot;<br />
<br />
The characters themselves along with their developments and relationships are hands down my favourite part of the show. A core part of the background plot is slowly revealing more about Cheng Xiaoshi and Lu Guang and their relationship. Within the last four episodes we&#039;ve learned a lot more about how they met and how much they rely and depend on each other. They fit each other perfectly, their powers working in tandem and their personalities complimenting each other extremely well. They give off a strong yin-and-yang vibe, even aside from the fact that Cheng Xiaoshi has black hair and Lu Guang has white hair.<br />
<br />
This show is so much fun to watch, and overall deserves a 10/10. The premise is original, well thought out, and is going down a great path! I can tell that there&#039;ll be quite a few twists and great plot points within the next seven episodes. I would really like to go into even more detail about this, but that would require going into an extremely deeply analysis and include spoilers. There&#039;s only four episodes out so far, but so much content in them already.<br />
<br />
If you do anything this summer, watch this! It&#039;s totally worth it, and if you&#039;re still wrapping up school like me, it can be a nice distraction from finals. It&#039;s popularity is slowly growing, and I can&#039;t wait to see where it goes~<br />
<br />
Edit on July 10th (last episode airing date): y&#039;all.<br />
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br />
GET READY FOR SEASON TWO I AM LOSING MY MARBLES OVER HOW GOOD THIS WAS THE PLOT TWISTS THE CLIFFHANGERS-

    Hopefully this review will not be overly confusing. I burned a lot of brain cells (as if I even had any) as I wrote this so there will be errors, and there will be times when I contradict myself. Please feel free to send me any suggestions and critiques.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: this show has some good and bad aspects, but I believe the good outweigh the bad and hence my score. As for whether you should invest your time on this, if you are looking for something new, a fresh perspective maybe, and if you like an episodic story with emotional ups and downs - this is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407684">
        the show for you. Okay.<br />
<br />
I think I’m going to start this review with a generic statement on life that will make me seem smart. Here goes.<br />
<br />
Photographs are the true windows into lives - the continuous string of moments and experiences that make them up, and just as diverse as each person. Ultimately, it is the photograph which showcases what truly makes us human. Among its other ideas, this show reminds us of the importance of these momentary captures to every life.<br />
<br />
(Whew, that was out of the way. Alright.)<br />
<br />
Shiguang Dailiren, or Link Click, is an anthology of short stories centered around a main mystery plot. The main plot deals with how Cheng Xiaoshi and Lu Guang, the main duo, attempt to resolve the many challenges that come with ‘diving’ into photos to time travel to their clients’ past. By contrast, each short story or arc shows us immersive, somewhat slice-of-life-like, glimpses into these clients’ many different lives. These arcs are emotional - some makes you cry, some warms and melts your heart. Seems like a pretty nice story so far.<br />
<br />
I will address several aspects of the storyline: cohesiveness of logic, clarity, and general direction. I will then address issues with the show’s style of storytelling, such as its inconsistent sense of agency, reliance on the shock factor, and something else.<br />
<br />
For the first one, I have to first mention the basis for the story’s premise, and that is time travel. Time travel is a pretty difficult trope to work with in general, since the genre itself tends to ruin many stories with the amount of plot holes it can give rise to. Link Click’s story specifically deals with the non-loop type of time travel, the one in which you change the past yourself and not because your actions in the past cause you to change the past in the first place. (Get a load of that.) This kind of time travel can be especially problematic as it means that instances of time travel are random and spontaneous and that the narrative has to account for their myriad butterfly effects. With that stated, it becomes clear that Link Click is already treading into dangerous territory with its basic premise. Regarding its execution of the premise, the show fortunately tries its best to cover up any plot holes and make its plot as self-contained as it can be, whether or not those holes are caused by the concept of time travel or not. Several of my concerns about inconsistencies along the course of the show managed to be resolved in later episodes. However, there will always be some kind of glitch you will find, and there isn’t always a satisfying but complex explanation that can deal with it. Nevertheless, I consider this deficiency of the show to be somehow inherent to its genre, and I take the stance that penalizing Link Click further for this is ultimately meaningless.<br />
<br />
Clarity ties into the cohesion of logic, but it’s separate because it also addresses the background of the plot. Questions remain about the origin and mechanics of the storyline, such as how did the photo-diving venture get started and how the superpower really works. But for fiction in general, not everything has to be explained. All that stuff forming the ‘peripheral structure’ of the central story, such as world mechanics, kickstarts the general sequence of events to be presented to our imagination, and since it is the latter which a narrative focuses on, the &#039;structure&#039; need not be expounded on in great detail. In fact, there’s the risk that over-explanation and magnification of these behind-the-scenes specifics can result in an incoherent narrative. As for Link Click, originally this ambiguity about its peripheral structure proves to be beneficial to its plot, but as season two has been announced I can’t help but be irritated that the producers decided to elongate the story to explain some background and thus create the impression that the original story in this first season is riddled with holes. In addition, the fact that new rules to the superpower of photo-diving are introduced as the story goes on makes it seem like they are devised on a whim to advance the plot. On the other hand, an exposition dump at the very beginning of the show fully explaining the different rules doesn’t sound quite good either, but it could have worked with creative adjustments. Overall, clarity is something Link Click might have to work on a little bit, but, granted, it’s already treading on a very fine line.<br />
<br />
For me, a story’s overall sense of direction is highly important when I try to evaluate it. What is a story moving towards? A resolution of a predicament? A revelation of truth? A story should make this direction clear throughout so that it can arrive at a solid endpoint. Only with this will a story have a good sense of purpose and meaning, even if it is just about fighting bad guys or hunting treasure. For Link Click, its episodic nature with semi-standalone episodes make this overall sense of direction somewhat muddled. The repeated back-and-forth transitions into the short stories diminished the clear focus on the narrative’s sense of direction to the point where I nearly forgot what the entire show is about during one arc. One big counterargument regarding my point is that not all stories have to have a sense of direction. Slice-of-life and comedy shows may not rely so much on the big picture as on momentary details. I do think this view is valid. Perhaps it is the story’s intent to present us with smaller pictures of the story along with a more expansive one. However, it’s still true that the transition between the overall and smaller arcs could have been better, at least to the point where the viewer’s mind does not get muddled.<br />
<br />
Now, finally onto Link Click’s style of storytelling: how its events move along in a sequential order. This ties into the story’s pacing, tone, and atmosphere, and it is essential to how immersive the story is. Broadly speaking, I’d say that the pacing of the narrative as a whole is inconsistent and maybe irritating, while the pacing inside most of the short stories is good. Because the individual arcs can get quite slow at times, you can feel that they ‘clash’ with the main mystery arc, mainly because the shifts back and forth feel disjointed and can take you by surprise. If you just look at some of the small arcs themselves, however, you will find that their pacing is comparatively more immersive, so much that it wouldn’t hurt for them to be standalone stories of their own. But back to the drawback of the overall pacing: the show not only took the risk of presenting this large-story-filled-with-smaller-ones narrative model but also failed to properly account for its deficiencies. The show does try to account for the model’s deficiencies, though, which leads us into the next section.<br />
<br />
The show relies too much on cheap shock value, primarily with its use of cliffhangers. I just mentioned that pacing problem, and it turns out that, on multiple occasions (almost every episode), Link Click, after a pretty slow and heartwarming mini-story, would choose to speed up the pacing by showing us a BANG! cliffhanger at the very end of the episode. This technique of Link Click is so overused that I had to talk about this problem in this wholly separate section. The story tries to fool viewers with heart-stopping scenes (granted, they are pretty good at stopping your heart) just before an absolute cliff of an ending into believing that the plot is good, rather than doing a gradual build up of tension that would have benefited the mystery part of the show. If you really think about this cliffhanger thingy in Link Click, it should seem very suspicious to you that it’s relied upon literally all the time to advance the main plot instead of maybe some variety. And it’s no wonder the cliffhangers might be one of the more problematic aspects of the show.<br />
<br />
A separate characteristic of the show that bothers me is how it evidently tries to resemble an anime. For instance, when characters argue or are exasperated, floating bubbles appear above their head or lines emanate from a building. Also, those distinctive anime facial expressions, like &gt; _ &lt; or • _ • (where the eyes are noticeably small circles instead of normal size), are rare in the show, but I think I saw one or two instances of them. My point is that the show’s decision to include these elements in order to convey stuff like character interactions is a bad choice. Obviously it decides to show these to make something seem very funny, but to me this backfires immensely because the show now has moods that vary too much: you have this very serious portrayal of psychological issues and you have these kawaii-like moments. These moods aren’t often shown back to back, but the fact that they exist in the same story makes your head spin around a little. Not only this, but the story also has to rely on prior and outside knowledge now, since non-anime fans usually don’t associate different types of anime faces with specific emotions. Not that non-anime fans might watch this but still. You might object that this characteristic of inconsistent moods exists in many other franchises and that I shouldn’t criticize Link Click for this, but the fact that the show had potential to construct a well-planned mood around its plot and then suddenly present us with the aforementioned distinctively anime scenes leads me with no choice but to ultimately penalize it.<br />
<br />
At last (sigh that was long), onto the characters. There’s really only one main character in the whole show, and that’s your black-haired hot boy Cheng Xiaoshi. The other two individuals in the photo studio are flat personality-wise (in this season, at least) and pretty much count as stock characters. Cheng Xiaoshi is the only person that gets relatively extensive coverage about his background, and throughout the course of the story he changes from this annoying dude that everything hates to being much more self-aware about his flaws. With only eleven episodes in this show, perhaps it is only natural that meaningful character development is limited to this black-haired boy. I must add that the specific scene when Cheng Xiaoshi develops is quite well presented and unique, and it definitely speaks volumes about the hidden talent that the producers have but unfortunately fail to utilize fully. I didn’t actually talk that much about characters, probably because this aspect is more straightforward than the plot.<br />
<br />
Besides all that about the plot and characters, I now detail my thoughts on the story’s message and overall purpose. It is clear that the story is mainly of the entertainment type, one that grabs you by the neck and forces you to watch several episodes at a time. It’s about the good guys fighting the bad guy(s). But there’s two good underlying meanings behind Link Click’s facade which I appreciate. Normally, time travel stories demonstrate that time travel is necessary to solve all your problems. You have this in Steins;Gate and ERASED. But Link Click introduces something new by also saying that time travel is not as useful in certain contexts. Cheng Xiaoshi famously (? lmao) states that sometimes, even stepping into people’s shoes back in time won’t solve anything. This message, even though obvious, is truly something fresh that Link Click passes on to us. Because of this ineffectiveness, sometimes it is best to leave the power of time travel untouched, and now we stumble upon a more familiar theme. The fact that Link Click bothers to show its reasoning leading up to this more iconic don’t-touch-anything-too-powerful message deserves praise. Onto the other message. This one is kind of meta since it directly connects to us. Remember what I’ve said at the beginning of this review about how photos are the gateway to what makes us human? Link Click, through the concept of photo-diving, shows that photos are quite literally gateways into what makes someone, someone. It repeatedly shows how photos are reminders of important moments and experiences in one’s life, and that we should look at photos to gain a better understanding of ourselves and to move forward in life. At the very end of the extra episode 5.5, there is a sequence of montages in which real-life photos showing key memories of Internet users are depicted one by one. This sequence ends with the statement that when daily moments, be it happy or sad or of any other emotion, enter a camera, the resulting photograph shows how we are remarkable in each of our ways and that we should not be afraid to show photographs, to show the true side of ourselves to others. Now, that’s a great message. It really striked home for me and made a lasting impression. They say that we as humans know a lot of things but we forget some of them from time to time. This message is one I’ve forgotten, and I thank Link Click for reminding me about the importance of photographs to one’s memories and, quite frankly, one’s being.<br />
<br />
About the art, I have nothing but general praise. Lighting and color were great, and backgrounds were consistent in their level of detail. CGI is really sparse and not distracting. Quite a few of the shots have a reflective quality to them, especially ones with flat surfaces like floors and tabletops. The basketball game particularly stood out, and so much that I recommend watching that game just by itself even if you are not planning to finish the entire show. A minor nitpick would be that characters’ faces look slightly different in their shape and layout between far-away and close-up shots, resulting in a hint of inconsistent art that some might call ugly.<br />
<br />
I would have not thought to comment on the voice acting for any show, but since Link Click only has its original dub I must say that the voice acting is noticeably average and probably even bad. The voice actors attempt to include a fair bit of emotion into their lines, but any chance it might move our soul is consistently nullified by the fact that you can TELL the actors are in a recording studio. It’s not so much the echos and any outside noise but more so the shallow depth of the sound waves that make the dialogue sound somewhat distant and electronic, if you get what I mean. During several moments I just had to roll my eyes because of how cheesy some lines sounded due to this sound quality.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I cannot help but gush about the opening and ending songs and sequences. All of them are pretty cool, not least the animated finger-tutting in the opening. They have really been a joy to watch and hear.<br />
<br />
This review was truly difficult to write, and this show difficult to rate as well. In the end, I settled for 6 / 10, which is definitely above average for me but maybe low for you. I must stress and re-stress the fact that a rating is nothing much more than a mere number, and what matters is that YOU watch it and YOU experience all that this show makes you go through. For me, that 6 was what my deeper innate instinct was (wow so romantic) - you could definitely say that it’s arbitrary. And that’s what individual scores really are. Different people feel different ways about a show and then proceed to hammer a number that they felt was right onto their thoughts.<br />

    [spoiler-free preliminary review]<br />
<br />
Have you ever wondered what it would be like to go into someone else&#039;s past? Feeling their emotions and reliving their experiences, could you really stop yourself from doing things differently and fixing their regrets?<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
The director of this donghua(chinese anime) is Li Haoling, who also did the story and direction for Flavors of Youth/Shikioriori (and also Heaven Official&#039;s Blessing). There are similar sentimental themes in Link Click, and the episodes do a great job of showing us the deep emotion rooted in things that are seemingly mundane. It even draws inspiration from real events. It pulls at viewer heartstrings and features unexpected

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397919">
        twists and turns. There is still a lot of mystery to be uncovered so far, and I&#039;m super hyped to see it unfold. The story also explores the consequences of traveling back in time(butterfly effect), as well as the morality of changing the past. <br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
The character designs are very stylish (as you can see from the cover), and the clothing styles are quite realistic, representative of what an average person would wear. The backgrounds are very well-drawn, and the watercolor backgrounds are simply beautiful. <br />
However, I can&#039;t say it&#039;s a 10 because the framerate isn&#039;t as high, but they more than make up for it with the beauty and detail. Thankfully, the animation is top-notch when it counts, and incorporates some amazing Sakuga scenes. Also the OP dancing animation is godlike, even if you don&#039;t watch the donghua I highly recommend watching the OP and ED. (fun fact: the entire OP was animated by a single person, taking 3 months)<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
The OP is a bop(and it&#039;s in english) and the ED is FIRE, and the insert songs for each arc are quite nice as well. The BGM does a great job of setting the atmosphere of a scene and bringing out the emotion during important moments. From triumphant to tense to poignant, It was actually composed by Tenmon, who also worked on 5 Centimeters per Second as well as some of Makoto Shinkai&#039;s early works. The overall styles consist of lo-fi/chill, shounen hype, pop ballads, orchestral, and my favorite, sad piano.<br />
The voice-acting is done very well, and you can hear a characters personality and emotion through their tones. However, the dubbing is chinese, which could be jarring to some, but I feel that it more accurately portrays the character&#039;s emotion as it&#039;s not overdramatized.<br />
<br />
Characters: 9<br />
The 2 main characters are very intriguing so far, and their backstories are revealed little by little throughout the series. Their personalities are almost polar opposites, which makes for interesting interactions, as well as growing tension... I&#039;m very excited to see how their friendship will be affected by their disagreements and struggles.<br />
Side characters are also given emotional depth and motives. In fact, in one episode they explore the growth and change of a character over decades. It&#039;s easy to get attached and invested in them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
If you enjoy a well-rounded and unique series, I would highly recommend this. Time is given to action, comedy, drama, and also romance. The sad moments are quite poignant, the heartwarming ones are truly wholesome, and the hype ones actually gave me chills. I&#039;ve been super hyped waiting for each episode, and since there is no source material, there is much room for theorycrafting, as well as small details and symbolism to uncover through rewatches and the OP/ED. <br />
<br />
All in all, this has been a series like no other for me, and I hope more people can give it a chance!

        Honestly, I can&#039;t see how this anime is ranked higher than others out there. Vinland Saga, Banana Fish, and Mob Psycho are better than this. That&#039;s not to say that this anime is bad, it&#039;s pretty good. But that&#039;s about it.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
-op and ending<br />
-art style<br />
-time travel actually executed good<br />
-the plot twist at the end<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- The story leaves you with a lot of questions. This is a good and a bad thing. There is a plot twist at the end which is supposed to leave you on the edge, but there&#039;s also just not much backstory at all. Like how did the characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409100">
        even get their power? Why are they working together (besides the fact that they&#039;re friends)? Who even set the &quot;rules&quot; for the time travel? Do they have an ulterior motive, other than their job? Etc... I really just wanted more backstory, because you&#039;re kinda just following these characters along for the hell of it. This is the biggest drawback I have with this show.<br />
- Idk if it was just me, but the impact the first ~6 episodes had on the story was little to none. Like I know each episode had a message to tell, but it lowkey seemed irrelevant to the overall plot line, especially near the end when the main conflict arises.<br />
<br />
Overall, I don&#039;t see anything groundbreaking with this anime. In my opinion, I can&#039;t say it crossed any significant boundaries in storytelling, and I&#039;m a little upset to see it ranked higher than some others out there. But take my opinion with a grain of salt. Maybe this is your favorite anime, but I would definitely rank some other shows higher than this.

    Shi Guang Dai Li Ren or Link Click is a popular Chinese cartoon about time travel. This has earned it many comparisons to Stein’s Gate, but beyond the time travel element this isn’t really a good comparison. Speaking of time travel, the plot of Link Click was problematic within China since the CCP banned all time travel fiction in 2011. It was considered “disrespectful to history and unhealthy wish fulfilment”. So instead of time machines, Link Clink had to create a truly bizarre and unique magic system to get the series approved by Communist Party censors.<br />
<br />
The series is about these 2 best friends named Xiaoshi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420682">
        and Guang who run an unusual business together. If they look at a photo, Guang has the power to know everything the person in the photo did or thought within a 12-hour period. Xiaoshi has the power to project his consciousness back into the past and take over the body of the person in the photo for 12 hours. Guang can then use his natural telepathy to tell Xiaoshi what to do in the past. Yes, Guang’s telepathy is so strong he can communicate with people in the past, even if they’re located vast distances away. They don’t actually try to change the past, but rather use their power to learn information. In the first episode, an unknown client gives the duo the task to recover the financial data of a powerful CEO who is suspected of fraud and embezzlement. Xiaoshi goes back in time 48 hours to take control of the CEO’s female secretary and has to find a way to read the data off the guy’s laptop. That’s a typical episode of Link Click until they meet their main antagonist later in the series.<br />
<br />
So how does Link Click compare to Stein’s Gate? Stein’s Gate is about a goofball mad scientist who accidentally creates a time machine by putting bananas in an old microwave oven. This immediately gets him targeted for assassination by the real-life research agency CERN, who in the world of Stein’s Gate is just HYDRA from Marvel Comics. They’re an evil organization of ex-Nazis who want to take over the world using super tech and succeed in 99.999 percent of all timelines. The plot of Stein’s Gate is fucking stupid. The series works because of its over the top characters and how they interact with each other. Stein’s Gate combines goofy humor with serious drama in a very VN sort of way. It is 100% a visual novel adaptation and it succeeds by embracing that.<br />
<br />
Link Click is kind of the polar opposite. It’s a series that lives and dies by its plot and high concept. The series succeeds because the plot is cool and the way they do time travel is unlike anything we’ve ever seen before. It’s not particularly funny. It’s not there to generate dozens of memes and reaction gifs. The characters aren’t as fleshed out or memorable as the ones in Stein’s Gate. Xiaoshi is the funny man and Guang is the straight man. Xaioshi has a heart of gold and Guang is kind of a cold bastard who is all about profit with little concern for the people in the photographs. By the end of the first episode, you basically know who these guys are. Link Click is less like a visual novel and more like a Hollywood blockbuster. I would say it’s a lot closer to Inception than it is to Stein’s Gate.<br />
<br />
One thing that actually impressed me about Link Click was its willingness to address China’s massive wealth gap and rural poverty that still persists to this day. This isn’t something that China typically advertises, so I assume this show was mostly made for a Chinese domestic audience. This may seem like a minor thing, but it shows up in Link Click repeatedly and actually makes the story more powerful while also making it feel more real.<br />
<br />
Link Click was made entirely in Shanghai by a studio called BiliBili. Apparently, it was made using Adobe Flash, so that’s actually really impressive. They made a God Tier rated anime in 2021 using the same software that brought us immortal classics like “Kerrigan &amp; the Frog” 20 years ago.<br />
<br />
Is Link Click worth watching? Absolutely! However, if you don’t have Funimation, you might have a rough time. On most of the streaming sites as of this review, some of the episodes use the official subs and some use the fan subs. The fan subs are bad. REALLY bad! I’m getting flashbacks to bootleg Naruto DVDs where they translated “dattebayo” as “Fuck!”. I think most MAL users that watched Link Click just watched it in the original Mandarin, but if you’re a gweilo and don’t have a Funimation subscription, be prepared for a rough ride.<br />

“Firstly, you only get 12 hours. Secondly, follow my lead and change nothing. Thirdly, past or future, let them be.” <br />
<br />
Those are the rules established right from the get-go said by Lu Guang, the seemingly cold, even-tempered young man to his more impulsive, emotionally-driven partner Cheng Xiaoshi. This is something that I think benefits stories that revolve around time travel, where rules are established so that instead of focusing too much on the mechanics of how it could actually work in real life, the focus is shifted on the stories being told. And man oh man do they do that well in this donghua

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407452">
        (Chinese animation).<br />
<br />
It seemingly starts off episodic, with Cheng Xiaoshi being the one going into the photographs and Lu Guang being the pilot of sorts, guiding him in what to do to make sure that they fulfill the objective given to them by their clients. Be it gaining information or saying things that the client regrets not saying at the time, that is what the duo sets out to accomplish. As the show goes on, you’ll also see stories that take multiple episodes to get the job done, which benefits in making nothing feel rushed.<br />
<br />
The true highlight in my opinion is how emotionally driven the stories told are. We see Cheng Xiaoshi go back into the past and become all these different kinds of people, and with him being our emotional vessel, we feel not only their pain or struggles but his pain as well. I cried at almost every single episode for this very reason, not to mention that in a few episodes there are parts where we as viewers start to realize things just as Cheng Xiaoshi does, and it hits you like a truck right in the heart (well it did for me at least). It is also during these emotional moments what we learn more about his past and who he is as a person. Lu Guang on the other hand is somewhat of a mystery (in the promotional character PVs his age is stated as unknown while Cheng Xiaoshi is 21, so that’s food for thought as you watch this), but we get glimpses into his and Cheng Xiaoshi’s past, making you crave more (hint hint there will be a season 2 so if you’re watching this show noticing that the pacing might not allow for a fully fledged deep-dive into who exactly he is fret not! you will be absolutely wanting another season anyways when you see the final episode!). Another fantastic aspect about this show is that some incidents that take place (epi 3-5) or even characters (epi 7) are based on real-life events/people. And it’s absolutely gut-wrenching to think about it.<br />
<br />
Another true highlight is the OP and ED. The OP is so catchy and you can really see what the animation studio is capable of, and the ED fits so perfectly at the end of each episode leaving you feeling either caught up in suspense or fear or just pure hype! I also quite liked the lofi-esque background music that was used a lot, it matched with the art quite well. Speaking of art, the characters are very distinct and the backgrounds are so stylistic and feel somewhat like a vintage photograph, making it nice to see something a bit different. The animation can feel not the smoothest at times, as it seems like perhaps there’s less frames in between, but that absolutely takes nothing away from how beautiful this show looks! <br />
<br />
Oh and the voice actors! They all did so well, and one of the voice directors is the god himself A-Jie (of Mo Dao Zu Shi and The King’s Avatar fame) so please do not write this show off just because it is in Chinese, it’s a beautiful language and the voice actors absolutely crushed it!<br />
<br />
Overall this has to be one of my favorite time-travel based shows I’ve watched thus far! I didn’t expect to be so emotionally affected while watching this show, and they really drove home the point of living in the present and cherishing what you have. Please do yourself a favor and watch this, I think if perhaps you enjoyed Steins;Gate, this will be right up your alley.

    tl;dr: good art, decent soundtrack, awful character development and one of the worst time travel implementations of any show. It&#039;s okay, not great, not awful. <br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
---<br />
They jump into photographs and change the past for various clients, why? Well, they don&#039;t really explain their motivations much. They simply do it. The story is one of the characters jumping back into the past to help a client, solve their problem and then return to the present. You might then wonder, why doesn&#039;t the main character go into the past to either<br />
<br />
1) save people<br />
2) accrue a large amount of money<br />
<br />
Well, he can&#039;t do that. Why? The show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415767">
        essentially brings up the butterfly theory, that one small change can have immense impacts. For example, if I traveled to the past and took up a few seconds of your future partner&#039;s time with idle conversation, you may never meet them. Then your entire life trajectory (and countless others) would be changed permanently. The show brings this concept up multiple times as a generalized excuse, it never expands on it and it&#039;s never applied to the characters when they change the past every episode. Every change the characters do in the past are seen as largely an isolated change, so why can&#039;t the main character change the past however he pleases? This is never answered. <br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
---<br />
There was a few scenes where I could tell there was a lot of effort put into it, then others where there was a lot of slacking. Overall, the background art/animation looked generally good. <br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
---<br />
Very hit or miss. It either perfectly suits the atmosphere or it ruins the atmosphere, they also reuse some tracks far too much in the wrong context. I did enjoy some of the OST&#039;s in this show but by the time I heard it for the 30th time, I stopped enjoying it as much.<br />
<br />
Characters: 4/10<br />
---<br />
I feel like I know nothing about the main characters motivations, thoughts or beliefs. Instead of focusing on the main characters, there was a plethora of episodic side characters that ended up being fleshed out more then them. I found that the random side characters they helped out seemed more interesting then the main characters, who didn&#039;t seem to have much of a personality. <br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10<br />
---<br />
It&#039;s alright but has a few flaws, mostly related to character development and the time travel aspect of the show. It&#039;s like Mushishi and Steins; Gate tried to have a kid but it came out a little retarded. Great concept but very poorly executed.

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
Put on your cheongsams and grab your chow mein, because I&#039;m about to write a review that will lose me 15 social credits! <br />
<br />
First of all, why is this considered the &#039;hidden gem&#039; of 2021? The voice acting is horrendously emotionless for the most part, the animation is so inconsistent by changing from mediocre YouTube fan animation quality to KyoAni on drugs, and the character development is non-existent. <br />
<br />
Everyone&#039;s favourite, totally not cliche, sci-fi theme is time travel. Except this time, Link Click is not another Steins;Gate. Like Tokyo Revengers — another time travel themed anime in 2021 — Link Click says

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417244">
        &#039;It just works.&#039; There is no fucking explanation as to why these two Chinese men can travel back in time. Anyways, Link Click incorporates this element of time travel into the story; Cheng Xiaoshi and Lu Guang work at a photo studio and can travel into photos at will. Xiaoshi would enter the body of the person who took the photo and can control their words and actions at will. As a result, their numerous clients ask them to go back in time and do shit, for example: saying something they wish they had said years ago. It&#039;s like the anime had only 4 canon episodes and the rest was entirely filler because it has had little to no impact on the show&#039;s development. In addition, the ending was such a major let-down. Rather than giving a proper ending, they raise the expectations for a second season. <br />
<br />
Like I said in the introduction, the animation is rather unusual to cover. It&#039;s good but bad as well. It seems amateur but also a high-end production. For the most part, it was mediocre. The opening&#039;s animation is fluid but it makes no sense why all the characters are dancing considering the rather somber tone of the story. <br />
<br />
Now, sound. The opening is still suck in my mind and I just can&#039;t get it out. The soundtrack is completely forgettable. Now, for my biggest point about sound; voice acting. First of all, let me get this out of the way. This has been the first time I have ever watched anything recorded in Mandarin. I&#039;m not aware of how they handle about voice-acting and how the general audience perceives good and bad. In my opinion, Link Click&#039;s voice acting was horrendously monotone. If it wasn&#039;t for the animation, picking up character&#039;s emotions in dialogue would almost be impossible. <br />
<br />
Link Click contrasts the two characters Cheng Xiaoshi and Lu Guang. Xiaoshi is brash and boisterous, and his partner in crime Guang is a mediator between the two acting as a calm and pragmatic &#039;controller.&#039; Xiaoshi goes into the photos and does whatever Guang tells him. Except, Xiaoshi is reckless and proceeds to do shit that is detrimental to both client and him. This contrast is rather obvious and not particularly well done; &#039;Let&#039;s just give them different color hair so people can differentiate who each person is because they look the exact same.&#039; There&#039;s also Qiao Ling, but she doesn&#039;t matter so who cares. Link Click tries to go into detail about Xiaoshi except it ends up falling short and seems like a major waste of time because they cover generic shit. &#039;Oh no! His parents died in an earthquake when he was younger?&#039; Honestly, it&#039;s pathetic how desperate they are into trying to make us emotionally attached to this character. Rather than having any reason to care about him through the progression of the show, they just shove into our face his tragic backstory and expects us to care. He ends up getting all of the attention and we know absolutely nothing about Lu Guang, the other MAIN PROTAGONIST. <br />
<br />
If you couldn&#039;t tell already, I didn&#039;t enjoy Link Click. <br />
<br />
All in all, Link Click really makes you really feel like Batman. Watch it for the conversations about &#039;2021&#039;s hidden gem,&#039; regret it forever. Disappointing. Now, save this review in a document because chances are it will get taken down. <br />

    Link click is arguably the one of the most unexpected shows I&#039;ve come across.<br />
Chinese anime has been on the rise in past 3-4 years with a lot of shows coming out ranging from esports focused The King&#039;s Avatar to historical wuxia like Modao Zushi, while quite a few of them were pretty solid on their own they all lacked that one element that could make them truly stand along with the topnotch japanese anime. Link click while in no means a perfect show but the first 5 episodes are one of the closest thing to that I&#039;ve seen. The plot itself is not much complex

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407565">
        at all. Simply if you read from the synopsis it&#039;s about a couple of dudes ( AND THERE IS NO BL) who can go inside photos at the time when it was taken. Now that sounds like any classical time manipulation show but what truly makes this one stand out is the really unexpected emotional element, The show itself is mostly episodic where the main duo (or trio you can say) take requests from customers and go back in the photos to help them in various ways i won&#039;t go into detail as to what kind of assignments they get or what the constraints of their power is because that will definitely spoil some of the fun but you can be rest assured that the best part of this show lies in it&#039;s simplicity yet making the most out of it. Not to mention the cliffhanger at the end of almost every episode combined with the ed that drops hard af makes you watch the next episode really hard.<br />
<br />
What Link Click actually has that makes it so beautiful to watch is the soul, you can actually see the passion of the screenwriters and showmakers that went through writing all those stories for the episodes. Each story tells about a different person and their life and what they went through while at the same time it doesn&#039;t completely turns into a tearforcer but instead leaves a lot of the emotional elements for the viewers to take as they desire and doesn&#039;t lose focus on it&#039;s thriller/mystery element. As I said before the first 5 episodes clearly blew me out, when i started watching i, it was just on whim and wasn&#039;t even expecting to go past 2 or 3 episodes but the hooking element of the show is really not to be underestimated. The show does take a dip after episode 5.5 and the arc after that is not as solid as previous one but the final closing arc specially the final episode is great that not only wraps everything up in a good emotional way but also has a little something at the end which pretty much confirms a 2nd season.<br />
<br />
The bgm is really nice and keeps the continuity of themes of the show and both op and ed is great. Specially the ed clearly syncs with those cliffhangers at the end of each episodes. Visuals aren&#039;t extravagant but as the show isn&#039;t action focused they turn out to be pretty nice and handfighting and martial arts scenes are done pretty well as a matter of fact.<br />
<br />
Overall if you&#039;re even a little bit into mystery/thriller genre then i will say this is a must watch. Highly recommended and even more so if you&#039;re into actual soulful shows.

    Have you ever thought of wanting to restart your life?<br />
<br />
Shiguang Dailiren (English Title: Link Click) is an excellent Donghua that has an incredibly well-written story and characters. You&#039;ll get into the elaborate worldview quickly. Because every cliffhanger makes you continue to watch this show until the end. Combined with the genius script, the main characters are lively and realistic. The setting seems high fantasy but actually modern suspense with body swap superpowers. Two protagonists, Cheng Xiaoshi and Lu Guang must get things going in a good way. A photo studio which they live in has material related to people&#039;s past. Cheng and Lu solve the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420341">
        root of all evil and save people. This is the main plot. But they&#039;re not necessarily a perfect duo. Especially Cheng has a complicated past and suffers from mental distress. Cheng tries to change the past and future many times while ignoring Lu&#039;s advice. Changing the past and future in this show leads to the destruction of the current. Lu understands the structure well. So he is always helping Cheng in the shape of speak situations with fluency. I can agree with Cheng&#039;s cruel past and he never forgives all villains related to some incident. Cheng is very human more than anyone else. His strong faith overcomes any difficulty. Lu is Cheng&#039;s best friend. His origin is unknown and not much of his development. But I feel sure Lu has the power to judge evil that can&#039;t be judged by the law. Two relationship looks like BL but completely different. It&#039;s a thick bromance. They trust in each other no matter what. Just like brothers. You&#039;ll admire their chemistry with profound dialogues.<br />
<br />
The story composition is various. The first half is episodic, the second half is continuous. Every episode has an original story and is thought-provoking about human feelings. Bonds, encounters, friendship, family love, lifelong separation. You can experience some supporting characters&#039; drama together with Cheng&#039;s body swap. Every story is unpredictable. Sometimes you must use your brain well to grasp the flow of the story. In other words, it advanced psychological battle. Not just change the future. There is Cheng&#039;s important past between those episodes. You&#039;ll know why he clings to change past. Atmospheres are basically very serious. You can&#039;t take your eyes off many tense scenes. Art and animation are really well-made, beautiful. I love Lu&#039;s looking. So cool. Effects and direction in the opening are very impressive. You&#039;ll definitely love it. Especially dance. Best dancing choreography I&#039;ve ever seen. Stylish and fashionable. Not your generic fiction dancing at all. I really love this opening. It can also be said ending visuals. Dark and depressing. This ending after entered cliffhangers is awesome. There are many foreshadowing-like scenes for later episodes. Although I can&#039;t tell you about them. Opening and ending theme songs are quite lit. Dive Back In Time is so catchy and the full version is more touching. OverThink is a heavy sound. It fits every episode.<br />
<br />
I was impressed by this Donghua from the heart. Everything is unique and interesting. You&#039;ll never bore Cheng and Lu&#039;s time adventure. Because very fantastic. If I&#039;d describe this show in one word, &quot;STOP THINKING ABOUT IT&quot;.

    I may not be able to fully give justice to this anime/donghua/ONA and its merits but I&#039;ll still try. (I&#039;ll be referring to this as an anime for simplicity&#039;s sake). Also, there&#039;s a slight spoiler at the end but there&#039;s a warning there too.<br />
<br />
First of all, this anime gets a 10 from me across all boards because of how nail-biting, tense, and mysterious each episode was. I had only seen the trailer for it and understood nothing of what they were saying but nevertheless, it got on my radar. And watching the first two episodes that came out was an absolute thrill because it set

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407429">
        the standard for the whole series (at least for me).<br />
<br />
Actually diving into the series, a majority of each episode can be seen as a standalone except for a few two-parters and the final three episodes of the show. It, in my opinion, has masterfully done weaving bits of background information on each of our protagonists with the story that we are following each episode (by their story I meant the story of the people whom they enter the picture for and their lives, I&#039;m so sorry if it&#039;s still confusing).<br />
<br />
Our main protagonists of this anime are the &quot;serious&quot; Lu Guang and &quot;goofy&quot; Chen Xiaoshi. While it may seem like a bit of a stereotype, you&#039;ll see a lot more to them as the show progresses. Every character shows development in every episode, and yes even the ones we only see for one episode. We see not only our protagonists grow but even the supporting cast and minor characters, as I&#039;ve previously stated. They&#039;re not just flat characters and they don&#039;t feel like fictional characters either because they feel so human and real in all of their actions, emotions, and thoughts. <br />
<br />
The story along with the characters are fleshed out in a way that makes the show addicting. I have a love-hate relationship with this show because although I love it to bits, the way it leaves me hanging every time an episode ends makes me seethe with anger and dying curiosity as to what happens next. The way that every episode ends is reminiscent of when someone texts you &quot;I have something important to tell you&quot; but when you reply they still haven&#039;t seen your message and are just completely off of the face of the earth.<br />
<br />
Story and characters aside though, the OP and ED is an absolute smash hit. I was fairly shocked at how good and catchy both were. The OP has cool hand gesture thingy thingies as its prominent theme.<br />
<br />
I absolutely loved this show and I hope for a season two! Have fun watching and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!!<br />
<br />
**MINOR SPOILERS FOR THE LAST EPISODE** (it&#039;s just how I feel about it actually, but still it might ruin your viewing experience if you haven&#039;t seen so you&#039;ve been warned)<br />
<br />
<br />
HOLY CRAP THAT&#039;S THE END?? I&#039;VE NEVER BEEN LEFT HANGING THIS BADLY BEFORE BUT YOU DECIDED TO END IT THERE???? EXCUSE ME BUT I AM LOSING IT OVER HERE!! Anyways, now that I&#039;ve vented and sorted my feelings about it I would just like to say that if it doesn&#039;t get a season 2, I will always remember how this show left me at the edge of my seat with no proper closure like no nothing.

    I will first start with my opinion on Shiguang Daili Ren.<br />
<br />
After watching 6 episodes, I found it to be a heartfelt anime and a hidden gem. It has perfect song choices for the opening and ending with such pleasing visuals, and I also love the art style. I had jumped into this anime blindly and was left astonished with the first episode because of the concept of being able to go inside the photos and was surprised with the result of what Xiaoshi&#039;s actions led to.<br />
<br />
Art: A perfect 10, unique and highly detailed<br />
<br />
Characters: 9, Lu Guang and Xiaoshi Cheng are very different from each other.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401578">
        Lu Guang is the calculated individual who doesn&#039;t let emotions interfere with the mission. Xiaoshi Cheng is the opposite because his feelings get in the way &amp; lead to stressful situations that require Lu Guang&#039;s guidance. <br />
<br />
Story: 10, The way these situations are set up, it&#039;s like a detective solving a case requiring scrutiny or else negative consequences will happen.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8, It&#039;s good, but there is not much to comment on.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed this anime a lot, and I think it deserves more attention.<br />
<br />

    *Spoiler warning!*<br />
<br />
<br />
Story/Plot 8/10 - Do I understand most of the plot, no. Do I enjoy it nonetheless, yes. It&#039;s not that complex but I still get confused about the altering the past aspect of it. My favorite episode so far was episode 3, not only was it about basketball, but I like the fact we gotta see Cheng Xiaoshi&#039;s perspective on the sport and why it&#039;s important to him. Overall, the plot may be confusing but it&#039;s really enjoyable, and weirdly (For me.) inspirational.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation 10/10 - PERFECT. This art is so unique, the style is so clean yet it has details that I&#039;ve NEVER seen

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398032">
        in any other show. The colors are always so fitting, and the animation is REALLY smooth. Best art I&#039;ve seen in a animation so far.<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10 - It&#039;s good. I wasn&#039;t really used to Chinese because I usually watch anime, which is of course Japanese. But, I still do love their voices!<br />
<br />
Characters/Personalities 8/10 - Personalities of the characters are great. Throughout the show, we&#039;ve seen many of Cheng Xiaoshi&#039;s memories any time he goes into a picture, and I feel like those memories are starting to give us more and more hints into his life and backstory, which many other shows I watch don&#039;t really do that. They either have a full episode to a backstory or barely backstory at all. So I like that for him and even Lu Guang we gradually learn more about them each episode, without fully focusing on their backstory. And I love Cheng Xiaoshi&#039;s carefree and nice attitude. We&#039;ve seen him feel bad for many of the people he&#039;s &quot;controlled&quot; and I respect him for that, he&#039;s even altered the past for them cause he felt bad. (As we know it didn&#039;t really go that smooth the first time, but that doesn&#039;t matter...)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall 8/10 - I may barely understand what I&#039;m watching, but I&#039;m enjoying it a lot, so that&#039;s good! Can&#039;t wait to see where the story goes! :3<br />
<br />
- - - - Update! - - - -<br />
Oh, OH WOW. The ending to this season had so many goddamn turns! Like, I am so confused right now. The last episode seemed normal and was answering so many questions and then the last freaking 4 MINUTES changed EVERYTHING! I&#039;m so happy that we&#039;re getting a season 2 and I can&#039;t wait to see what this was all about!

    The absolute tragedy that more haven&#039;t people watched this show kills me. This is the best anime (technically) donghua that I&#039;ve watched this past season. This doesn&#039;t feel like a show that is just using the time travel as a gimmick. Its unique form of time travel and the way it impacts the characters is just so raw and emotional at times I was near tears.<br />
<br />
The show also has abundant mystery and twists and turns. It&#039;s brilliant, and I loved every second. <br />
<br />
As for the characters, I appreciated the bonds the main characters have, but as you would expect, the start of the show is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407567">
        mostly focused on Cheng Xiaoshi. Love him or hate him, I think if anyone else was in his shoes, they&#039;d be hard pressed to do any better. <br />
<br />
I do wish that the characters outside the episodic stories got some more fleshing out, but it seems like they&#039;ll be making a season 2, so this could be remedied later. The lack of explanation on the supernatural elements as well, like how the two male leads even have these abilities also would have been nice...but again...season 2.<br />
<br />
As for the art, I like the style, but animation wise it suffered a bit, whether just due to a lack of animation sometimes or just certain characters looking off. But really, it&#039;s hardly awful. I&#039;ve seen much worse.<br />
<br />
All in all, Link Click is simply fantastic, and sitting at 11 episodes currently, probably the shortest anime of last season. Just watch it. You won&#039;t regret it.

    &quot;we can&#039;t change the past. dont question the future, as the future will change because of us.&quot; ─ lu guang<br />
<br />
story: 10/10, link click isn&#039;t necessarily a show about thrilling action and the deep sci-fi structure of time travelling - it&#039;s a donghua about the hardships in life: the things from our past that still causes us regret till this day in the present. it could be personal matters revolving around friends and family or devastating things that no one could predict.. realistically, past is something you can not change - but protagonist cheng xiaoshi has the power of diving back in time through photographs (the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407849">
        gold of preserving memories) and the goal to make no one regret what happened in the past as much as he&#039;s not allowed to change it.<br />
<br />
art: 9/10, there are times where it isn&#039;t consistent but it&#039;s completely okay to me! inplick has done a beautiful job with their artstyle creating the designs of the characters and founding the shows entire artstyle. it&#039;s so unique, the shows poster is what dragged me in the first place! hellooo amazing artstyle and attractive characters<br />
<br />
sound: 10/10, it&#039;s amazing. from the suspenseful or heart-warming ost in the donghua itself to the AMAZING opening and ending, it&#039;s just so good. do take a listen to the full version of dive back in time (op) and overthink (ed) once you get the chance!<br />
<br />
character: 9/10, this is a rating for the current season of course. it shines light on protagonist cheng xiaoshi and his experience connecting his emotions to the clients. our other main characters calm and collected lu guang and carefree outgoing qiao ling don&#039;t have much depth behind their backstories (because it&#039;s confirmed that we&#039;ll find out much more about them in season2!) but they make for a wonderful trio of red yellow and blue~ also, some of the clients stories are just unforgettable. should i mention that majority of them are based on true-stories? ranging from devastating things in history to people in the shows own animation studio<br />
<br />
enjoyment: 10/10, i was on the edge of my seat EVERY SINGLE EPISODE!! just watch it, it&#039;s an unforgettable experience with all the cliffhangers - especially since i was tuning in from the start and having to wait weeks to find out what happened after the end of each episode.<br />
<br />
overall: 10/10, link click is a masterpiece and i&#039;m glad that myanimelist is acknowledging it. it truly did pave a way for the donghua industry, thank you so much cheng xiaoshi and lu guang! i&#039;ll see you soon in season 2<br />

    SPOILER-FREE review, based on episodes 1-5!<br />
<br />
Overall (9/10)<br />
<br />
From the first episode of Shiguang Daili Ren (LINK CICK), there has been something special about it. It balances its gorgeous art, voice acting, soundtrack, and interesting premise with well-built characters and engaging storytelling. Shiguang Daili Ren stands out from the crowd and moves the Chinese donghua market forward. First we got Mo Dao Zu Shi (The Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation), then we got Tian Guan Ci Fu (Heavent&#039;s Official Blessing), and now, it seem like it&#039;s Shiguang Daili Ren&#039;s time to shine.<br />
<br />
Story (9/10)<br />
The premise is quite straightforward. Three young adults run a photography shop, and sometimes they get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398849">
        special clients who want to alter something in their past in one way or another. Lu Guang has the power to help Cheng Xiaoshi enter these photos and helps him achieve the client&#039;s goals while not altering the present timeline. That is, until the present will inevitably be changed for the sake of plot. Though simple, it&#039;s captivating. Each individual story involving separate clients also has their specialties, with emotional impact involved in every episode. You really get to connect with these characters that you&#039;ll likely only see in two episodes at most. So far, many of these stories have centered around the everyday lives of those with humble beginnings in the countryside. In any case, by the 5th episode, the main plot has begun to move forward, involving the main characters in the present timeline more. Every episodes brings about a sense of nostalgia and empathy for the stories and characters; it never gets boring.<br />
<br />
Art (10/10)<br />
With a light, watercolor-esque feeling, the art is truly exceptional. It uses realistic coloring and rather gritty-yet-clean line art, almost like fine chalk. The animation is also exceptional. In any case, it&#039;s absolutely beautiful.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10)<br />
The OP and ED go hard, a mix of Chinese and English rap/pop. The OST on the other hand is pretty standard, but it works perfectly well.<br />
<br />
Character (9/10)<br />
Each character has their own past, though the three main characters&#039; pasts and backstories are yet to be discovered. Cheng Xiaoshi and Lu Guang, through the small snippets we have been shown, seem to have intriguing pasts and personalities that aren&#039;t based on any clichés, making them very natural and relatable. Thanks to their realistic personalities and a between their partner dynamic, it gives for a very enjoyable watch. As of episode 5 actually, surprisingly, the supporting cast may be the star of the show! Every client is a unique and charming character in their own right.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10)<br />
My eyes are glued to the screen when watching Shiguang Daili Ren. Of course, there are imperfections to this donghua for sure, but there is never a dull moment in this show despite the &quot;normalcy&quot; in its characters and visuals in comparison to the many low-budget, low-quality animes we&#039;ve been seeing as the anime market becomes oversaturated. It&#039;s a breath of fresh air, and I am excited and proud to see more Chinese donghua make their way into the mainstream!
