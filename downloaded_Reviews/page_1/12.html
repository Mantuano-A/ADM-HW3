    A strong display of emotional resonance; the second season of 3-gatsu no Lion manages to go above and beyond expectations to provide something of overwhelming beauty.<br />
<br />
It’s a show of many acts; the first season—while boasting many heavy themes—is an elegant watch, which reels the viewer in with a soft mood, realistic characters and delightful interactions, but never hits you with strong emotions. The second season—filled with melancholic tones, depressing themes and powerful messages—gives the show raw emotional power to invest the viewer at full force.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shifting from the focus of Rei’s depression, this season brings more focus to the different mentalities of the supporting cast, both

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275879">
        in the real world and the back-drop of shogi. <br />
<br />
The season starts off with a focus on Hinata, and the daunting problem of bullying. Bringing forth an insight into the mass hysteria it brings and the draining effects on the victims, and those caught up in the drama. This arc is nothing short of impactful, and although it’s heavy, it never becomes painful to watch, something many other drama-oriented series fail to accomplish.<br />
<br />
What makes this so powerful is down to the commonly relatable topic of bullying, the powerful visual presentation and the amazing characterisation found in the antagonist Megumi Takagi.<br />
<br />
Megumi’s construct as a bully sets her apart from other archetypical antagonists—in the sense that, there are reasons to her actions—she clearly suffers problems in her mentality, leading her to torment others as a form of escapism, giving her somewhat an ability to be emphasised with for the wrong reason.  It’s even easier to empathise with Hina, due to her characteristics, with her helping Rei with his struggles and inspiring him to escape his depression. Rei feels the same on the topic of helping her, creating a close bond between the two, something that plays importance throughout the rest of this season.<br />
<br />
Although the first arc is definitely in the lime-light of this season, the series continues to impress in its focuses on different characters. The character study of Souya Touji is a breath-taking display of a mind disturbed solely by the life-style of shogi, with stunning direction to show his inability to hear those around him. The shogi match between Shimada and Yanagiharai uses profound visual imagery to show the determination of both characters and the weight Yanagihara carries. And the pleasant moments with Hina give the show a relaxing and charming escapism from the heavier themes.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don’t consider the cast to be merely characters, they feel human. From Rei to Nikaidou to Yanagihara; each one has strong human characteristics that allow for relatability and empathy for these personalities as we see into their differing lives. <br />
Even though Rei has less focus this season, his role as the lead character is as strong as ever as he seeks a way to help those around him. It’s inspiring to watch, as Rei’s empathy drives him to assist in fighting the varying problems that arise for everyone close to him. His outlook and narration provide a strong connection from the viewer as he continues to improve his life which was once locked in place by his haunting past. As the main character, his journey is an impeccable experience and he is character of relatability and complexity.<br />
<br />
This season exposes elements of characters unbeknownst from the first season, such as the extent of Nikadou’s illness, the pressure Akari feels being unable to help Hina and the different psychological and emotional effects each character experiences in accordance to their surroundings. Each revelation is equally as tense and creates stronger connection to the characters once their situations are understood. <br />
<br />
<br />
Studio SHAFT empowers storytelling through visual motifs and stunning presentation, bringing everything to life with powerful imagery to reflect the mood each scene portrays. Every visual element is a sight to behold, with gorgeous backgrounds, varying styles and ability to speak many words through its delivery that bring out many emotions from the viewer.<br />
<br />
This mood is only enhanced by the stunning soundtrack composition. Melancholic tracks reflecting the depressing yet elegant mood can easily bring you to tears, acting as peaceful additions to the stunning composition of visuals and story.<br />
<br />
<br />
For a while now I’ve been pondering over the topic of depression, this in turn has affected the way I view anime titles, and what I get out of said titles. While Cardcaptor Sakura healed me from having negative thoughts, End of Evangelion’s existential elements blew my mind away so much that the thought of depression was no longer on my mind. But, I think the best form of escapism from a feeling like depression is facing it head on, and that’s exactly what 3-gatsu gave me; giving me personal affection to its elements. <br />
<br />
To me, 3-gatsu no Lion is the epitome of human emotion, an experience rivalled by none. A show that has brought me to tears almost every episode, and something I hope many others can appreciate in the same way.<br />

    A shrill. As he stretches to fight the leftover sluggishness of a satisfying sleep, he decides to step out on the balcony. The warm wind of a mellow morning slowly brushes past his fragile frame as if greeting him friendly. The sunshine reflects from the river just beneath the railing; a lustrous shimmer signals the change of seasons. He leaves the apartment. A lot has changed over the past year: his listless demeanor is all but gone; he has made friends and acquaintances—he isn’t alone any more. His steps have become strong and determined. He has moved on.<br />
<br />
This show is not about him. Just like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275870">
        Rei, it has moved on from the times of subdued, somber sadness; there is another storm brewing in the distance. Unannounced, but with utter and immediate intensity, the current changes as the happy-go-lucky Hinata gets home one evening: her face is pale, her expression pained; tears start a sinister stream. There is bullying going on in Hinata’s class. After fighting for and protecting the previous victim Chiho who has since left the school, the bullies shifted targets towards her. She knows she did nothing wrong, that what she did was in fact right—but it doesn’t stop her stomach from aching nor her heart from breaking. During a crucial time in Hinata’s life, she is left alone, being ignored by former friends and classmates, utterly isolated. With bullying, there is no easy way out; just one obstacle in the form of a weak-willed teacher is enough to create rips and ripples, all of which reflect, add, and cancel each other out—resulting in complete chaos.<br />
<br />
In face of a problem near impossible for an outsider to resolve, her family and Rei do their best to help: Rei tries to repay the debt of Hinata and her sisters saving his life from dreariness and depression in a misled attempt to rack up money; Akari on the other hand views Hinata’s well-being as a responsibility relayed to her by her late mother—a responsibility too big for her to carry. Both of them fail to accomplish their goals and experience what to them seems like an indisputable defeat. However, this assessment based on the self-centered and self-serving assumption that one can do anything if one tries couldn’t be further off; their so-called failures led to them spending time with Hinata, listening to her. When she ran away, Rei ran after her; in times of sorrow, she found solace in a soothing and supportive home that let her smile again. Was it not for these small everyday gestures, for friends and family supporting her no matter how ferocious or frantic her feelings, she could not have persevered. They didn’t fail. They did well.<br />
<br />
The ripples may wane but they never vanish, Hinata and Chiho might never fully recover—but in the end, these blemishes are part of what makes a human: they add another layer to their characters, dreams, ambitions and passions, to their relationship with family, friend and foe and add context to their everyday actions. As these values accumulate, they give form not to a character, but something greater. All of these people have their own stories to tell, some of which we may never hear of; their stories intermingle and paths cross, branching off and meeting up again—sometimes. Some days, the torrents may grow harsh, but other times may bring with them a friendly flux; some of the tributaries may meet a dead end earlier than expected, others may follow along the river of life and flow until they are released into the deep, dark ocean.<br />
<br />
Consequentially, the further one coasts along, the more colleagues and communities one will lose to such bifurcations. For a person such as Kishou Yanagihara, there are no more people to lose: all of his former friends and rivals have thrown in the towel, and as they pass on what is left of their hope and passion for the sport, they also pass on from the world of shogi. Struggling against sickness and fatigue, this burden weighs down heavy on the eldest active shogi player’s frame: their sashes seem suffocating, and like a farmer staring at the remnants of a burnt field, he has no one and nowhere left to turn to. However, just like the farmer he knows that this desolate and depressing wasteland will soon give rise to a new mellow-looking meadow, fertile and fruitful. He catches on fire: his burning passion paints the picture of a haunting human torch slowly burning to cinder and as his fiery fighting spirit overtakes his self-doubt, he finally comes to terms with the fact that life moves on… even if he won’t let go just yet.<br />
<br />
The show moves on, its natural flow harboring both healing and heartbreak; their paths continue to cross and their stories to intermingle. And as the pieces fall into place, they give rise to an unparalleled display of life and humanity, poignant and personal. March comes in like a Lion sets a new standard not just for Slice-of-Life as a genre, but for storytelling itself.<br />
<br />
Score: 100<br />

    There is no anime that I am more confident in calling a masterpiece than 3-gatsu no Lion. What it is able to do is so powerful and I find it unparalleled by any other show that I have watched. Every single aspect of the show is masterful and is able to shine and enhance the show even more.<br />
<br />
With 3-gatsu no Lion looks to be about Shogi, shogi is only one thing in a sea of ideas and themes that the show covers. depression as well is a main theme of the show, but I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s the only theme. Rather, I&#039;d say the theme

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275881">
        of the show is how everyone is struggling. The ways that the show is able to show this theme is absolutely magical.<br />
<br />
Everyone has a story. Too often shows forget this. But 3-gatsu no Lion knows this so very well. Nuance is something sorely missing from many shows that 3-gatsu has in spades. Each character that comes up is fleshed out and even flaws as well as strengths/. There is no such thing as the hateable villain that is built up just to be hated. Every single character is shown the good and bad parts of them. Whether it be a bully or the opponent to a shogi match, each character is treated like someone real who has their own issues and things that they have to deal with. And while they may do things that aren&#039;t nice. and in any other show would get them labelled as an unlikeable villain, 3-gatsu is able to show that there are other aspects of their life that make them this way. Everyone is explored in this way and it makes the show feel so real. In the end, there is no such thing as a truly bad person, and 3gatsu gets it.<br />
<br />
Whats even more amazing is not just that it&#039;s able to flesh out these side characters, but the extent to which it&#039;s doing so. 3-gatsu has the powerful ability to make a character cast them in a negative light, but then show you their own story and change the audiences view so that they now want to root for them as well. It&#039;s magical how the show is continually able to showcase different situations and different issues that are relatable and lead one to want to support the one that they are watching. Even if they were the opponent just a few minutes ago, the depth and feeling that goes into exploring these characters brings me around to them, and makes it so it&#039;s hard to decide, who do I want to see win?<br />
<br />
Added to this is 3-gatsu&#039;s powerful imagery. 3-gatsu uses images in the best way that I&#039;ve seen in animation. While I&#039;m fine with a more realistic approach and like what most anime do, there is something extremely powerful about 3-gatsu&#039;s art and animation. Metaphors and symbols are brought up. But they aren&#039;t just flashed onto the screen. They are explored and shown in the person that they are digging into. If someone feels tied up and forced into something, it&#039;s not just something that they say, it&#039;s something shown with multiple sashes building them in place and making it hard for them to move at all. Creative and powerful visuals are something that 3-gatsu does so well. Even in the lighthearted happy scenes 3-gatsu is able to make them feel so rich. Bright happy colors and smiles litter the scenes and make them so infectiously happy. They&#039;re sugary sweet and are even able to make those happy feelings feel so rich. <br />
<br />
After all that leads into another aspect of 3-gatsu&#039;s power. The duality of life. While the show may be focused on struggles and depression, the show also knows that there are happy parts of life. Life isn&#039;t just a series of unfortunate events. While many other shows would focus on the negative to show that 3-gatsu shows everything. It shows the dark and sad moments and the art and animation to go along with it. But it also shows the moments of family, fun, friends, and all of the things that they do that brings light into their world. 3-gatsu even gets to the point of having cats talk to showcase the happy atmosphere that they&#039;re going for. And these scenes are so powerful because they show what bonds can do even through struggles. While everyone is struggling and have their issues, they&#039;re still able to come together and have a fun time. To support each other. And those moments feel so rich with that in mind. 3-gatsu really gets life it&#039;s not just good or bad things. It&#039;s good and bad things. And no show comes close to detailing them both with as much power as 3-gatsu no Lion does.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s what makes it so magical. It&#039;s not only able to make one feel strong feels, but it&#039;s also able to make one feel happy, to make one invested in a character they only just met, and make me at least feel this greater appreciation of the world around me. Nuance is the word that so many anime lack but 3-gatsu has. And in the end, every element of this show is masterfully done. The story is engaging and well written. The characters are filled with flaws and depth. The art is filled with rich symbolism and power, and the music to go with it fits very well and only increases the power of this show. Not only is this one of the best shows that I&#039;ve ever watched, but I feel like it has something really important to say. Everyone is struggling. Everyone is good and bad. While one may be an enemy or someone seen unfavourably there is probably a reason they are that way and there is more to them than just that. And if the world was able to understand it I think it&#039;d be much better off. This show isn&#039;t just masterful at all of its elements, it also gives a greater understanding of the world which I think would benefit everyone. If there was any show that I&#039;d recommend to anyone it&#039;d be this one. This is the best that animation has to offer, and I love it.

    One year after 3-gatsu no Lion’s first season, the second one has arrived. And it manged to be even more outstanding. <br />
Seven months after the first season’s ending, we get to see the continuation of Rei’s journey; His journey to find happiness and a place where he belongs. Has he managed to overcome his emotional scars and find people he can call friends and family?<br />
<br />
The second season starts in a truly heartwarming way that shows how much Rei has grown and how lucky he feels for finally finding friends he can have fun with at school, and a family in the Kawamoto household. When compared

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275875">
        to his former self, a boy with a reclusive personality and depression caused by his traumas and insecurities, Rei has grown as a person in an amazing way. While he is still a flawed being and is still searching, he has slowly overcome most of his personal issues, gained confidence, started trusting others and being more open to them while creating meaningful relationships with them. And most importantly, he is able to smile and laugh honestly, from the bottom of his heart. His pure laugh at the end of episode 16, even though it might sound like a simple thing, was one of the most powerful scenes of this season.<br />
His growth throughout the whole anime, whether it’s done through his everyday life or the competitive shogi scene, is truly impressive and refreshing.<br />
<br />
Of course, Rei isn’t the only character to get the spotlight and, even though he is the protagonist, there were quite a few episodes where he felt like he was a side character. But when it comes to 3-gatsu a situation like this is welcome. Umino Chica has the talent to create amazingly realistic and unique characters. It’s never uninteresting to follow an episode or a whole arc focused on a side character, slowly see him being fleshed out, to learn his background, his personal thoughts, problems and worries. <br />
There are a lot of characters like this from the professional shogi scene, like Yanagihara and Souya, but even some that got less focus like the pigeon man (Yamazaki) and others. No matter how much focus they got, they were all memorable characters with interesting personalities and backgrounds.<br />
Other characters that we know from the first season, like Nikaidou, Shimada and many others, keep appearing and receiving their fair share of focus and development.<br />
<br />
The Kawamoto sisters are shown a lot in this season, mainly because of a certain arc: The arc about Hina becoming a victim of bullying.<br />
This is one of the greatest arcs of the story so far for many reasons. It depicts bullying, the reasons behind it, its consequences and the damage it can cause in a very realistic way, without exaggerating it. The main bully, Takagi, is a really mean girl, but through her meetings with the homeroom teacher we get to understand the reason and thoughts that led to her actions. This doesn’t make what she did any better, but it’s great to see that even a character like her is getting a realistic personality.<br />
The one who supported the Kawamoto family was Rei, even if he thought that he couldn’t do anything for them. The Kawamoto sisters were the ones who gave him affection and treated him like family, and now he’s the one helping them. It’s nice to see how much Rei has developed and come to love the Kawamoto family through this.<br />
Of course, the one who got the most focus and development in this arc was Hina and her relationship with Rei. Her emotions and thoughts were fleshed out incredibly through the whole arc. She showed how great a character and brave girl she is, and Rei even felt like he was saved by her words.<br />
The rest of the Kawamoto family, mainly Akari, got a bit of focus in this arc, as well.<br />
<br />
The storytelling is still done in a poetic way, with a slow pace that makes the viewer immersed into the story as it gradually progresses.<br />
While the anime is dramatic for the most part, the lighthearted comedy is still here. The subtle comedy of 3-gatsu no Lion is pretty funny and it can bring a smile to the viewers’ face or laughter. It doesn’t feel forced and the balance between the dramatic and funny moments is perfect.<br />
<br />
In the second season, too, shogi has an important role in the anime. The psychology during the matches is portrayed excellently. The great description of the characters’ thoughts and emotions during the matches, helps the audience that can’t understand shogi know what’s going on the board. During the matches, the characters also find the chance to get fleshed out and developed, which leads to the story’s progression.<br />
<br />
Like in the first season, studio Shaft has followed every single scene and line of the source material faithfully. They have only mixed up a few chapters at the end of the anime to make a more suitable ending episode, but this doesn&#039;t really pose a problem.<br />
<br />
The story and character sections of the review have gotten a bit mixed up already, but when it comes to a character-driven story like this one, it’s hard to talk about the plot without mentioning the characters. But rather than a plot with a clear beginning and ending, 3-gatsu no Lion mostly consists of pieces of different characters’ lives presented in a realistic and human way.<br />
<br />
3-gatsu no Lion does an exceptional work at presenting complex, deep, realistic characters and fleshing them out. Their personalities, backstories, flaws, thoughts, worries and emotions feel human and even relatable. The anime never forgets any of them, it keeps showing them to the audience and developing them, while they all have a part in Rei’s life, even if it is as an obstacle.<br />
The relationships and interactions between the characters also feel very human and the chemistry between them is really nice.<br />
<br />
Moving on the art and animation, it’s quite easy to notice that studio Shaft has put an even greater effort to the already awesome visuals of the first season. Umino Chica’s artstyle combined with Shaft’s powerful direction, fluid animation and unique touches is a delight to the eyes. The artwork seems experimental at times, but there is also a feel of realism in it.<br />
The color palette is really nice and the colors are used correctly according to what each scene wants to convey. Dark colors show up in the dramatic scenes and brighter ones for the more lighthearted ones. The shift of the colors really adds to the mood and atmosphere and makes the audience understand better how the characters feel at that moment, especially when it comes to the serious and dramatic scenes and the shogi matches.<br />
The use of metaphorical scenes with symbolism is truly masterful, and depicts the characters&#039; thoughts and emotions in a very creative way.<br />
The character designs are still good and unique and the characters’ expressions are drawn in a great way.<br />
The backgrounds are beautifully drawn and detailed.<br />
<br />
The music of the show is truly captivating, the soundtrack has an active role in creating the appropriate mood for each scene and allows them to convey their feeling better.<br />
The OPs and EDs, just like in the first season, are very good and memorable. It’s also a nice detail that the songs keep getting a bit cheerier and have brighter art as Rei gradually grows and becomes happier by overcoming some of his troubles. They are all nicely directed with great animation and the use of watercolor-like colors in some of them is beautiful.<br />
The voice actors did an awesome job once again and managed to convey the characters’ feelings perfectly. <br />
Even the animals’ little dialogues in their cute voices are pretty funny.<br />
The sound effects are also used well.<br />
<br />
3-gatsu no Lion is an anime with a unique take on the slice of life genre. It doesn’t just follow everyday adventures of characters’, but it also gives them a mature and human touch. The anime’s storytelling is truly intriguing with its heavy characterization and greatly used psychology. Its life lessons regarding different issues one can come across in life and growth of the characters can even influence the viewers. It’s a series that makes simple everyday things feel powerful and offers compelling drama. Along with the beautiful artwork and music, it can stir up the viewers’ emotions and tug at their heartstrings through both the dramatic and lighthearted scenes. Watching 3-gatsu no Lion is a breathtaking experience, a true masterpiece that keeps surpassing the viewers&#039; expectations and capturing their hearts.

    Outstanding, just as amazing as its first season.<br />
After watching the first few episodes, it feels like returning to a warm home on a chilly autumn day, being engulfed by the sweet scent of apple pie and hugging my cup of hot cocoa. <br />
<br />
Story: (10/10)<br />
Everything is told through such a beautiful way like a poem. Most of the emotions Kiriyama is feeling are presented to us through the art style, which plays a big part in how the story unfolds. It gives off subtle Your Lie in April vibes but without the extreme sadness.<br />
<br />
Each episode is composed simply and even without a lot of action with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264179">
        the plot it still captures my attention. We follow our favorite protagonist from last season, Kiriyama Rei, as he embarks on a new journey. How his life has taken a turn and he now experiences new things he has never felt before.<br />
<br />
He starts to feel welcome, realizes his worth, his character has made subtle changes from the beginning and it it heartwarming. Just seeing Kiriyama put thoughts into others and share his life with the sisters is such a wonderful sight. There are many more sights like this in the episodes to come, even if they are after boring shogi scenes you have to plow through them, promise.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: (10/10)<br />
As stated previously, the way the style is drawn out captures the plot and conveys every emotion through color. It shows us what is going on inside Kiriyama without him having to give a monologue for us to understand.<br />
<br />
The art style in itself is great, I admire how the producers created this masterpiece. Quality points I&#039;d like to make, Kiriyama is stunning in the first few episodes so far, the colors are like watercolor and the lines are fine like ball point pens. Especially the scenery is like a painting. As expected from how fascinating the first season was. Refreshing none the least. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: (10/10)<br />
Who knew that a simple scene about making ramune make me cry?<br />
The music captivates my heart and brings me to tears, just remembering the prequel through the reused sounds makes the scenes heartwarming.<br />
<br />
The music is very nostalgic and they even kept the preview music from last season. That would have to be one of my favorite parts of the soundtrack.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: (10/10)<br />
Our favorite boy, Kiriyama, is wonderful. I much more than just admire him, I relate to him in many ways. The way he grows at his own steady pace, how he is overcoming his loneliness, becoming stronger in his own special ways. Of course the spot light isn&#039;t all just this memorable main character, the Kawamoto sisters are very valuable to the plot just as much as Nikaidou and Shimada. Even side characters such as Sensei Takashi are a delight to the plot and to Kiriyama&#039;s development.<br />
<br />
Each character has their flaws and their strengths, their own personalities and lives we look forward to getting to know. Not one character is without some part of Kiriyama&#039;s life. Even if it means antagonists who really force Kiriyama to rethink his actions and push him over the edge. Especially when side character&#039;s struggles are just as harsh as the main character&#039;s, it shows that they are simply human. It is beautiful and I won&#039;t ever forget the characters who taught, not only Kiriyama but me, lessons of life. As in every anime we look forward to watching, this one really hits home with the characters&#039; developments and struggles.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (10/10)<br />
I absolutely adore this series if you couldn&#039;t tell. I don&#039;t think I will ever stop admiring Kiriyama Rei. Since I did rewatch the first season I expect myself to rewatch this one. The purly subtle humor is always the best and creates a warm feeling of joy unlike most anime who force out jokes and represent comedy through inappropriate subjects. 3-gatsu no Lion does not disappoint with its mixture of emotional scenes and comedy relief moments.<br />
<br />
I am truly happy to see Kiriyama finally happy in this season, he is slowly coming to love himself and those around him. He is having fun in high school, slowly opening up from how he was. <br />
<br />
This series is very memorable and I hope to see anime styles like this for future anime. Although, the original is always the best.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
It has not changed much from its prequel. Capturing my heart with each episode, 10/10, glad Kiriyama crossed the bridge again.

         If you thought that the Shogi in season 1 was boring but stuck it out anyway for the melodrama then you are in luck! <br />
     For many people season 1 was good and season 2 only gets better. And if you thought that the best part of the show was the MC&#039;s inner turmoil then by all means this second season won&#039;t let you down! As long as you weren&#039;t too attached to Kiriyama Rei that is. We kind of left him behind to pursue other crestfallen and overly dramatic heroes. If you think questions like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267729">
        &quot;show me the proof&quot; should be followed by 3 full minutes of internal dialogue as a black haze surrounds the horror-struck listener, then it doesn&#039;t get better than this!<br />
     If you are only in it for the art, be not afraid. They didn&#039;t suddenly fire their art team and higher the guy who did Pingpong! <br />
     As far as I am concerned, however, this show is a far cry from its predecessor. The plot is a rehashing of the MC&#039;s struggle in season 1 but in a MUCH less interesting setting with much less interesting characters. There are entire episodes in which Kiriyama does not appear, because he simply plays no significant role in the plot. The story of the young, struggling, prodigy shogi player stagnates and falls by the wayside. The story of a person battling their inner demons lives on, growing increasingly mawkish to the point that Season 2 is almost a parody of season 1. I had expectations that the story would have to change to move on with Kiriyama. I never imagined that instead the story could remain the same and it is Kiriyama who has been left behind.

    All fart no shit.<br />
<br />
After finishing season 1 I was very excited to watch season 2 and after finishing it, I am more than a little disappointed. Writing one of the most negative reviews for this anime brings me no pleasure, but I really wanted to put into words why this left me feeling so disappointed. <br />
<br />
The first season set up a lot of different interesting things that do not get pay off here. A big part of season 1 is Rei&#039;s foster sister Kyouko, who fell for a man the same age as her father because she felt that Rei replaced her, leaving her feeling

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282839">
        sort of obsolete to her father. Also it is implied that Kyouko sexually assaulted Rei when they were younger. Nothing is done with this in season 2. Akari at 19 years old had watched her mother die, her dad leave, and she was then responsible for raising her younger sisters. Nothing is done with this in season 2.<br />
<br />
It is incredibly frustrating to me how little development or new information there is in this season. I was really looking forward to seeing more of Rei and Kyouko&#039;s relationship, but it is as if she never even existed. If I was not supposed to care about her then why spend a few episodes in the first season making me care? I really do not understand this. I&#039;m assuming this is addressed later in the manga, but Kyouko deserves more screen time. Ignoring her until she is maybe needed for some future episodes is not OK. Her story hasn&#039;t moved forward at all this season. <br />
<br />
Then there is what the show did with Akari. Nothing. A 19 year old who is forced to raise 2 kids is not worth exploring apparently. A third season could explore her character more, but currently with 44 episodes out there just isn&#039;t enough to her character. She is a single parent who cares deeply about her family and is also working to support them financially. She never complains and is completely selfless. Her character is not believable. I need to know how she got to where she is, and what sacrifices she has made in her life, simply hinting towards it isn&#039;t enough for me. If she has accepted that she is a single parent and needs to dedicate a large part of her life to that, show her making that decision. She must have gone through a lot, and I want to see it. We know hardly anything about her. Also it is impossible for a single parent with a job to cook the meals Akari cooks and not be incredibly stressed and/or tired. <br />
<br />
If you were to add up all the scenes of characters cooking or eating with nothing important to the overall plot happening, it would probably be over an hour of footage. Most of what the sisters seem to do is cook and eat food. If you do not enjoy watching people eat food then this anime will be boring for a lot of its runtime. After really enjoying season 1 I was fast forwarding through some scenes in this, which made me feel sad. And does anyone really want to watch two old men argue about some shit that is unimportant to anything else happening in the series? Far too many scenes with old men being boring. <br />
<br />
Rei seems happier in this season than the previous, but it doesn&#039;t feel logical. Previous plot points that would require Rei to change as a person to resolve are simply ignored so Rei can move forward. He mentions he doesn&#039;t have the confidence to phone his sister, and then it is never mentioned again. There is no substance to anything. His relationships with people need to be in a different place at the end of a season than to the start otherwise what was the point? The only character he connects with in any meaningful way is Hina. <br />
<br />
The main plot of this season revolved around bullying. A serious topic and the anime does treat it as serious, showing how it affects children&#039;s lives. This is easily the strongest part of this season. Hina is bullied and it mirrors Rei&#039;s time in school when he was bullied and all alone. The difference this time though is that Hina is not alone, because she has Rei to help her. He wants to save her from what he had to go through. His motivation is clear and his actions (mostly) make sense. The resolution of the bullying would have happened if Rei was not even there and he himself knows this. However the support he offered to Hina helped her get through it and is reason for him to be proud. It was frustrating then when he felt like he did nothing; this could have been a turning point for Rei where he gains confidence and has reason to like himself more, but the anime hurries onto the next thing. On the topic of Rei and Hina, he is 18, and she is 13. Rei&#039;s teacher thinks he&#039;s in love with her and encourages him. He is 18. She is 13. Bad teacher! <br />
<br />
To conclude my thoughts on this season, I am quite upset to write that I disliked it. There were individual moments that were good, but the anime lacked focus. After the first season I was ready to recommend 3-gatsu to a friend, but now I am not going to (if a third season comes out and is as good as the first then this will change). I went through all the episodes in a short amount of time and honestly feel like it was a waste of time. It is possible that a third season could fix the problems I have with this show and focus more on interesting character development, and I really hope a third season does happen. A lot of people seem to love this series and me not enjoying it doesn&#039;t mean I want others to not enjoy it. I honestly tried to enjoy this, but I was left wanting a lot more.<br />
<br />

    Ah, 3-gatsu no Lion. How I wanted to love you, and how disappointed I ultimately was. Most of the time I agree with the crowd when it comes to such things such as media review. If it’s well-received by critics, I tend to like it as well. If most people find shortcomings, most of the time I resonate with those as well. But considering I’m giving this anime a rating substantially lower than the stellar (above 9 at the time of writing) average on MAL, take this review with a grain of salt. <br />
<br />
Sangatsu no Lion disappointed me not so much with what it was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315148">
        but with what it could have been. For a bit of context, I originally watched the first season as part of an anime club viewing (1 episode weekly) at my school. I remember never feeling that the show and I really properly got along. I was put off by the constant metaphors and imagery that seemed to be picked up in one episode and abandoned the next, the seeming lack of direction in the show’s pacing and plot, and the overall lack of true character development not only in the MC but also in those surrounding him. Some scenes, drawn and animated not beautifully but to a degree I could really appreciate, were strikingly offset by the garish “comedic” inserts that seemed to be inserted randomly and looked as if they were made right at the end of a weekly deadline. The music, while featuring some good tracks, was largely forgettable. It was one of the shows that I felt no connection toward and one that I rarely looked forward to seeing the next week. It existed, I watched it, and that was it.<br />
<br />
But after so many episodes, the first season finally ended and I was left with a choice – give it up or go on to the next season? My brother told me the second season was better, and it looked like MAL agreed. I decided it was best not to leave it undone and began the second season in the summer of this year. And now the real review begins.<br />
<br />
First, let’s talk about the animation. It’s good. I can’t fault Shaft for what they’ve done here. In particular, the openings tend to be very well drawn and make good use of color and lighting. But the second season still suffers from the bizarre comedic inserts that plagued my enjoyment of the first season. 3-gatsu is not designed as a comedic SoL, but for some reason the writers felt that their story would be better portrayed with numerous, brightly colored and loudly voiced insert scenes with 2-D caricatures of the main cast, often when expressing something intended to be funny or outrageous in nature. I found myself laughing at these scenes not because I found them truly funny (and I rarely did) but because they seemed so out of place in an anime that leaned so heavily on meaningful use of color, light, and sound to explain the story both within and outside of the cast’s heads. Furthermore, there was never a place during the anime where I paused and said to myself “what a beautiful scene,” something that I have found myself doing in the majority of shows I’ve scene (regardless of how well I like them). So in total, I found the animation and the art style good, but held back by some of the strange comedic inserts (though it is worth saying that there are less in the second season than the first).<br />
<br />
Let’s move on to the music. The openings and closings, again, while being decent, are not memorable. I am a major believer in the idea that the opening of any anime play an absolutely critical role in setting the mood for the show, and those that do it well (looking at you, Spice and Wolf S1) are that much better for it. But very little about either of the openings (and closings too) use their positioning in the show to their advantage. I found myself skipping them more often than not. I only realized just how forgettable this show’s soundtrack really was until I realized that I could hum the next episode preview BGM more accurately than the actual opening – and that’s a bit of a shame.<br />
<br />
Now for the meat – the characters. I sincerely believe that Sangatsu no Lion suffers from the curse of Evangelion. While this is more prevalent in the first season, 3-gatsu is mainly premised on the MC, Rei, and the thoughts that rage within his head. But unlike Eva and some of its excellent protégé, this show does not use the “internal battle” motif effectively, and I believe it is mainly due to a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means to tell a story. Like so many others, 3-gatsu is designed to evoke a sense of commonality in its viewers. You are supposed to resonate with Rei’s internal struggles and see yourself in them. And this idea, at first glance, is executed well. A boy, feeling outcast by his peers, picks up a hobby and meets other people to find new meaning in his life. It’s a realistic concept, while exceptionally overused, but it isn’t the problem. The issue comes with the context. Rei is a child prodigy, a middle school marvel who turns professional in his sport of the mind, Shogi. His family, having died in a car crash, leave him absolutely alone, adopted by a family who simultaneously reverences and disdains his skill. We pick up on Rei’s story as he moves out of his adoptive house to his own apartment, living entirely off his own income from professional shogi tournaments. The realism of Rei’s basic condition – outcast, depressed, alone – is tempered by the sheer unrealism of his situation and character – a genius whose entire family has passed unexpectedly, in the most stereotypical of anime tropes. This would be one thing if the show was written such that it was self aware of this uneasy juxtaposition between realistic and unbelievable, but it isn’t. At all points are the viewers stuck in the limbo between “yes, I identify with this” and “this simply isn’t me.” There’s a bit of Rei in most of 3-gatsu’s intended viewers, but there’s very little of the viewership in Rei, and the anime acts as if this glaring issue simply doesn’t exist. Shaft portrays the MC as a normal young man, without agreeing to the fact that he is anything but. <br />
<br />
In the interest of keeping this as spoiler-free as possible, I won’t dig too deep into Rei’s story, but very little of it helps the frustration I have with his characterization. As a slice of life, it follows his daily movements – to school, to Shogi Hall, to tournaments, and to the Kawamoto house. While the second season is notably better than the first in this regard, Shaft still suffers from the curse of pacing and focus. There are several sub-arcs in this season, lasting anywhere from one to several episodes long, but very few of them are properly followed-up on and brought to a satisfying conclusion. The writers introduce a character – normally one of Rei’s opponents but occasionally someone related to the rest of the cast – and draw out their character in great depth for a small while. You start to get excited: this is interesting. You become invested. But as soon as it starts, it’s over. The writers turn aside, never to bring the arc to its conclusion, and even some of the intimate insight we are given into the newly-developed character’s mind are cast to the wayside. Some of them reappear – too little and too late, unfortunately – later on in the series, but several are never heard from again. I suppose this may be Shaft’s way of pressing their overall thematic movement – that everyone is on the train of life together, and separating and joining is all part of the journey – but it’s overused and honestly frustrating by the time the season concludes. <br />
<br />
By far the best arc in the story deals with bullying experienced by Hinata Kawamoto, one of the three sisters whom Rei befriends in the first season. It’s realistic. It’s brutally honest in many ways. It resonates with so many of the show’s viewers. And unlike so many of the other disappointing sub-arcs, it is the only one that is actually brought from start to a satisfying (though still realistic) conclusion at the end of the season. But why? Why do you need a boy genius, an orphaned shogi sensation, and all the rest of the show’s unrealistic characterization to talk about such a mundane but meaningful topic? It almost supports the argument that 3-gatsu is better off without it. And it almost seems that the show directors become almost aware of this by the time the last season concludes. Rei takes his wins and losses less seriously. Shogi exists mainly as a continued tool but the show’s passion for it dies away. The boy genius becomes less and less notably for his acuity, but Shaft trudges on with the theme almost out of necessity. Why? 3-gatsu is one of the few shows where the unique premise (come on, how many anime are based around professional board game players?) drags it down rather than making it memorable. <br />
<br />
I have relatively little to say about the rest of the show’s cast and characterization, mainly because some of the most interesting characters have only a temporary turn in the spotlight just to be more or less used as distraction fodder for the remainder of the anime. Shimada and Nikaido – likely two most interesting and round (literally in the latter’s case) in the entire show, only appear as major story points in only a few episodes. While one could argue that Shaft is simply exercising reason with its balance of character development as to not overstep and overreach, these omissions are more frustrating than welcomed. You expect some deep development only to be played with a minor plot point or comedic insert. <br />
<br />
To wrap up this review, let’s talk about what this anime could have been. The directing has a very solid grasp on conceit, and even does a decent job following through from arc-to-arc, season-to-season. The water analogy is used frequently and to good effect, not only for Rei but also for supporting cast members. The art, again, can be very appealing and used to good visual effect. Some of the characters – though perhaps not the main cast – are actually quite interesting and show some good, though limited development. But the off-putting insert comedy, the lack of ability to focus and finish on character development, and particularly the juxtaposition between a “realistic” and “unrealistic” MC ruined much of the show for me. 3-gatsu second season would almost have been more appealing for me had it focused on the life of a single, normal boy who experiences the realistic trials and struggles of himself and those whom he cares about without the shogi theme or the constant need to press the “prodigy” moniker.<br />
<br />
3-gatsu is a superhero anime that masquerades as a realistic slice-of-life. As such, it fails at both without a shred of self-awareness of what it is trying to do. But I’m not mad I saw it – I think it really opened my eyes to what I appreciate in an anime, and made me respect just that much more how difficult adapting a source material into video can actually be. But perhaps unfortunately, finishing it has made me more excited than anything else to move on.<br />

     The second season is so boring, it shows a lot of not usefull stuff from kawamoto family, and it gets really anoying as the anime goes. When I saw the first season, I got super interested on Kyouko, Nikaidou, Shimada and Souya, but they barely appear on the this season, instead, there are a lot of scenes of Akari cooking, I mean, not intersting at all. <br />
 They even added a scene of Rei and Souya playing so we could kill our curiosit, but if feels like they just gave up creating an end for Rei&#039;s history, when it felt like we would be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325631">
        able to see changes on the shogi scenery on season 1, all the characters kept loosing and the only character who don&#039;t keep being a looser is the anoying Hinata, why are there so many episodes for this average character?????? I just started jumping all the scenes where she apeared till the end of the anime. It was a bad experience

    For people new to 3-gatsu no lion, the main problem with this series is, It doesn&#039;t have any negative reviews and it feels as if fans are only watching it. So here I am writing a genuine review for you so that you might have a better understanding of the series you are about to watch.<br />
<br />
For an anime to be worth 10 ratings for people reading your review, you have to get that nostalgic feel or be in that anime trance for a week, it should be as if the scene were replaying over and over before your eyes. <br />
But guess what?, I forgot the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278370">
        feeling just after a few hours of watching it.<br />
An anime can be praised for its Art, music, and character development, but at that end of the day what you need is to watch a story and be able to tell damn, I felt connected and stay in that story for a long time.<br />
<br />
So how did this anime get such high ratings and top reviews? Well &#039;March comes in like a lion&#039; has 22 episodes and is a Slice of life (SOL), So most chances of people watching season 2 are due to the appreciation it received from season 1. i.e, mainly fans of this series watch it hence the final result is the rating you see and most of the 10 rated reviews are those which are written because of the last 4 episodes, damn they are too good, but that doesn&#039;t mean you have to sit for 16-18 episodes of normal everyday life to get that smiling conclusion. Well, I am not saying that it is overrated, I am just cautioning you to not get deceived by them. <br />
<br />
This is actually too much into a &quot;Slice of life&quot; (SOL) that it wouldn&#039;t give you any lesson or knowledge which you might be expecting in a SOL or in an anime.To be honest this is just way perfect SOL, without much melodrama but more into daily life activity which might or might not be interesting.<br />
<br />
To all those who haven&#039;t watched the season 1, if you are a fan of SOL type of anime then this is the best thing for you or else if you are trying to adjust watching this due to its rating then I am sure you might be disappointed and left with regret. Just watch it like an another SOL, then it&#039;s better and you might even be a fan. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll stop the commenting here about the overall series, I hope I lowered your hype levels, the following review is based on the idea that you have already watched season 1 : (If you need REVIEW ON SEASON 1 then I&#039;m writing it under the heading &quot;FAQs&quot;, look for it below)<br />
<br />
PLOT:<br />
<br />
The story continues from where it stopped in season 1, i.e., from the formation of the Shogi science club and the normal everyday life of Rei begins, as usual, going to school, playing shogi etc.<br />
<br />
This season is divided into 4 major Arcs: Bullying Arc, Souya Arc, &#039;Match b/w shimada and Sakutarou Yanagihara&#039; Arc and finally, &#039;Hinata&#039;s future after middle school&#039; Arc followed by the conclusive ending.<br />
<br />
This story is made as if all the problems in the world come only to these people surrounding Rei...as you know shimada in season 1 with stomachaches, Nikaidou with anemia, Hinata with bullying, and then there is Souya and Sakutarou which I won&#039;t spoil. It makes you feel irritated at some point actually but somehow the writer tries to compensate the feeling in later episodes by either giving unexpected or a satisfying conclusion to the Arc.<br />
<br />
This might be the experience you might have with the series, so that reading this will help you get a better idea of what I meant from the sentences used at the beginning of the review: (I&#039;ve put the arcs in such a way not to spoil you, as a matter of fact there is nothing to spoil in a SOL of this kind)<br />
<br />
Coming to the 1st Arc:<br />
It was able to portray bullying in the best possible way unlike any other anime, which only show up to what child experiences but not what parents face. Here Hinata gets bullied, but the problem was, I was feeling most of the time,&quot; why isn&#039;t it over yet, dammit why is he dragging so long, I need to know what happens in the future&quot;, the reason I felt is because of the pacing, it was too damn slow, watching Hinata in such situation was unbearable, the story neither was fully concentrating on bullying nor on shogi matches...it was felt half hearted as if the episodes were put just to show a script rather than creating an impact (earlier episodes). but later, the feeling is compensated a little by giving a good conclusion.<br />
<br />
2nd Arc:<br />
This is my favorite Arc of all the Arcs, which really concentrated on Rei&#039;s Shogi skills and mainly creating that exciting environment before a match begins, It also gives you more information on the Walking devil or Shogi playing Machine, the lookalike of Rei:- Meijin Souya<br />
<br />
3rd Arc:<br />
This Arc is a match between Sakutarou and our beloved Shimada, Well It’s another match between two people who aren&#039;t the main characters, between an old man defending his title and a promising new generation genius. This is also another dragging story, with repetitive flashback scenes which are kinda irritating.<br />
<br />
Well I know a little about the feeling of players of mind games, since I am a chess player myself, to be honest the things shown here, like the thought process behind players especially in Sakutarou&#039;s case, it was meant to create emotional connection with the story...but in reality, you would be actually thinking about what the next moves are gonna be and mostly have a feeling that you shouldn&#039;t be losing the game... because, the amount of mental strain is too much for you to think about what your &quot;friend said&quot;. There is absolutely no chance for you to remember his words and reminisce because if you are losing a match, your brain would be really depressed cutting off such thoughts, it would try to either fight back or give up.<br />
<br />
And 4th Arc:<br />
This arc is another boring or routine story which you see almost in every Slice of life stories where it&#039;s the end of the school and time to move on... <br />
and finally, there comes the perfect ending which is made with all the best soundtracks and colorful Art, they are able to hold both the fan-base, the haters back which resulted in 9 and 10 rated reviews.<br />
<br />
Yeah and I almost forgot!!! The Jokes are the same usual lame dumb ones with &#039;squeal&#039; and &#039;swish&#039; character sounds, but you really need them because they are the ones which seem to relax our brains after such mindscrewing sad scenes. The jokes made in the 22nd episode were the only ones which made me laugh truly.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Rei: He seems more mature and responsible and is helpful instead of being a crybaby. This series is not about him or his past, I can guarantee you that. <br />
<br />
Hinata: Well she is a really cute and a good person, to be honest, I kinda like her attitude of helping others and sharing your problems with family rather than shutting yourself which is the best thing you can learn from this anime. <br />
<br />
Rest all characters aren&#039;t focused much or I don&#039;t feel the necessity to mention them, I wish there was more Shimada&#039;s or Nikaidou&#039;s character development, but unnecessary time was wasted on side characters like Yamazaki Junkei&#039;s lifestyle etc. <br />
At many instances in the series, we are suddenly in the middle of a conversations of characters and you wouldn’t know how came to be in that situation. I know, it was meant to cut short the time but it didn’t seem to give the full impact of the situation.  <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The Art is in its peak form, it is really way better than the season 1, the 3 sisters who take care of Rei are cute as ever and the scenarios are beautifully drawn, I fell in love with the city lights in background and moonlight which are better colored and drawn.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack:<br />
This time the soundtracks weren&#039;t that great, I mean most of the scenes were sad ones so yeah there were mostly normal melancholy guitar and violin with a mix of flute music. But in the last 4 episodes, we get to hear the beautiful soundtracks which are famous in season 1. The openings and endings songs aren&#039;t that good when compared to season 1, but were kinda normal to hear, only the 2nd ending song seemed good with the piano intro.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Yeah, it may be a Masterpiece of great Art and well-written psychology of people and their reactions to the situation, but for a normal general audience like me, we can&#039;t get the true essence from one sitting, nor do we have time to re-watch it either cos It has 22 episodes of content with lots of meaningless stuff in between. If you liked the season 1, then I would definitely recommend you to watch this season, but if you hate it then don&#039;t watch this series because even if it shows about bullying and has few other good episodes, I would rather ask you to watch some other anime than this :)<br />

FAQs:<br />
<br />
SEASON 1 REVIEW:<br />
<br />
I am not a fan of Studio Shaft&#039;s Art or animation, I don&#039;t like anime similar to Monogatari series because of their Art, which feels weird, but 3-gatsu no lion&#039;s Art is different from those type of series, because even though, it had black, blue and whitish colours which represent sad theme, it also has colorful drawings with beautiful soundtracks representing the happy atmosphere.<br />
<br />
Cutting everything short, it’s a Slice of life of a high school student and ‘kinda’ orphan named Rei Kiriyama who is a professional Shogi player, who lives independently with the money he gets from the games, he is sometimes taken care by 3 Sisters (one of them is Hinata) who live in the neighborhood. (I don’t want to mention further as it’s already available in the plot of the series) <br />
<br />
Well many anime have the scenario as if the hero has a natural talent but due to financial problems, they wouldn&#039;t come up. But this one is different, our hero has talent, money and also has a family to help. But did you ever think that this talent would make you go away, live separately and lead a sad depressing life? This anime depicts some another level of reality which actually makes you relate to it and the only problem is there is no &quot;Moral of the Story&quot; at the end.<br />
<br />
Like I said earlier Art and Soundtracks, were the ones that made me compelled to watch this show, they are also perfectly timed to give you correct emotions. Even the opening and ending are simply awesome which makes you listen to it at every episode without skipping.<br />
<br />
Coming to Enjoyment, starting 2 episodes were boring, but it picks the pace and moves on to another level by keeping you engaged till the end. By the way, the jokes are dumb, you would get used to them in the longer run.<br />
<br />
Season 1 Overall:<br />
Go and watch season 1 without dropping in the first few episodes, it is good, But if you hated it after completion, then skip season 2 because season 2 is similar to 1 and it might turn out to be a 22 episode hell. :P (Sorry for the lazy review of Season 1, please read other ones )<br />
<br />
<br />
Comparison between both the Seasons:<br />
Season 1 is way better when it comes to story and narration, because there is suspense feel throughout the series and keeps you wanting to know what actually happened in Rei&#039;s past...but season 2 is more of the SOL of other characters (Mainly Hinata) and hence not much suspense is felt, you just feel like watching it just for the sake of completion...<br />
There is also a perfect representation of the feelings of players during the matches in season 1 as I personally know as a chess player which was shown very less in season 2<br />
Only the match between Souya was the coolest thing in this series because you get to know about the great Meijin.<br />
<br />
<br />
dub? : Season 2 doesn&#039;t have a dub yet, but the dubbed version of season 1 is good and has good English.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know why I couldn&#039;t like this show (season 2) that much, maybe it&#039;s because I was tired binge watching continuously without gap both seasons, it made me exhausted by the time I reached 16th episode in season 2. If you want me to re-watch it again to get a better understanding, it’s just way too much pain to sit through another 22 episodes and waste time, I would rather go watch some new anime to know a new story :)<br />
<br />

    3-gatsu no Lion is a spectacularly popular and accredited anime that unfortunately falls short of all the hype that the series has generated. It is incredibly overrated, however it is still decent relative to the thousands of anime series out there. I know I&#039;m going to receive a lot of flack for this review so without further ado I shall outline my arguments.<br />
<br />
There are several quirks to the anime that need to be mentioned:<br />
<br />
1. The anime follows a &#039;Manga&#039; style. Each episode consists of chapters that have been effectively translated from the manga into the anime. This gives the series a different feel compared to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325804">
        other slice of life anime series. This is both a good and bad thing. On one hand it offers a refreshing style, however the lack of an &#039;anime conversion&#039; leaves the series feeling slow-paced, contrived (at times) and reminiscent of the humdrum of everyday life. <br />
<br />
2. The anime employs a highly detailed and nuanced aesthetic. All of the scenes, the lines, the art, colours, lighting and sound have been meticulously selected to provide the series with a style that fits perfectly, bolstering both the characterisation and plot of &#039;March comes in like a Lion&#039;. In fact, it would not be a stretch to say that the masterfully crafted aesthetic of the anime hard carries the series over the plot (which although interesting, is drawn out and too realistic to the point of being non-impactful on the audience).<br />
<br />
With that in mind here is why i believe &#039;March comes in like a Lion&#039; is overrated:<br />
<br />
The series has interesting and in-depth characters which means that on top of the main plot arc, there are also a series of sub plot arcs. These sub plot arcs are usually intriguing, however the way they are introduced, built up and then ultimately discarded later on in the series leaves the audience feeling dissatisfied. I was continually wondering when particular sub plots (no spoilers) would resurface before the end of the second season only to discover that the writers consider the half-baked resolutions (or lack thereof) to these sub plots satisfactory. One argument in defense of this would be to say that there are too many sub plots and perhaps in later seasons these will resurface. If this is the case then I would critique the entire structure of the anime series as a whole, which has too many lull periods and too many uninteresting sub plots competing for screen time over fully fleshing out the more interesting side arcs. Overall there just isn&#039;t enough &#039;bang&#039; in March comes in like a Lion.<br />
<br />
The anime tries to balance out serious and intensely dramatic moments with light hearted &#039;slice of life moments&#039; almost exclusively based around food. While in some episodes they achieve a perfect balance to keep the audience entertained, some episodes go way overboard to the point where it detracts from the main plot and it just comes across as cheesy.<br />
<br />
I remember one episode in the first season of March comes in like a Lion (episode 9) where Rei is depicted screaming his lungs out across a gorgeous and fiery sunset-lit backdrop. This moment absolutely captivated me and highlighted why so many people have fallen in love with this anime.<br />
<br />
And that is extremely important to mention. This series has a lot of beautifully sad yet equally gorgeous moments. And when these moments occur in the series, they stand out even among some of the most artistic anime series around. But these moments are few and far between. Yes this is exactly what March comes in is going for, but for viewers like me you&#039;re going to feel sadly disenfranchised given how much emotional investment a series like this takes.<br />
<br />
If anime is meant to provide an escape from reality then March does the exact opposite of that. On one hand there will never ever be an anime that is able to convince us that anime characters are real people like this series has, and for that this series is to be commended. However in achieving this goal, the series has fundamentally sacrificed many key facets of what makes an outstanding anime.<br />
<br />
Put simply, the show is slow, relies heavily on its beauty, is overly cheesy, is structured poorly if the goal of the series were to be to provide enjoyment to the viewer and finally, lacks satisfying conclusions and dramatic cliffhangers due to its unique &#039;Manga&#039; style. 7/10

    3-gatsu no lion that aired in fall was already a masterpiece, a unique, mature show that had very interesting plot points and characters, it was surprising to see that such a show managed to get a sequel, but apparently it was very famous in japan, which is great. now, 3-gatsu no lion&#039;s second season is, in my opinion much better than the first season, don&#039;t get me wrong, both seasons are masterpieces, but seeing this one and all the characters advancing and changing, it&#039;s simply great to watch.<br />
<br />
TL:DR: amazing characters, Good, slice-of-life story, the best music and openings, and of course, SHAFT&#039;s art, also known

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266722">
        as a 10/10 without even looking at it.<br />
<br />
Story:10/10, for a slice-of-life show, this actually has a story, and surprisingly that story advances. in this season, we see more focus on the side characters and the misery of other characters that aren&#039;t rei, there is lots of drama, lots of emotions and bonds developing and most importantly, our main character isn&#039;t so gloomy anymore, characters developed and changed, and the story is slowly moving.<br />
<br />
Characters:10/10,as if the characters from the first season weren&#039;t good enough, this season is even better. in the first season the focus was on Rei,Shimada and his circle of characters, but in this season we see Lots of developement for the side characters as i already mentioned, like Hina and her family, the teacher and by the end of their arc, i&#039;m sure we&#039;ll be right back to shimada and the story. though in my opinion, this arc that focuses on the three sisters is the best arc in the series ( the first arc in season one was also fantastic. ) it has lots of emotions,lots of &quot;reality&quot; put into it which is why i loved it alot. i&#039;ll keep the &quot;Long&quot; review for when the show is finished but for now this is all i have to say about characters and story.<br />
<br />
Art:10/10, it&#039;s Shaft. amazing scenery, great camera angles, beautiful character designs and simply perfect art.<br />
<br />
Sound:10/10, YUKI sings the opening again and her voice is fantastic as always, it&#039;s a very memorable and great song, the ending is by a band that never sung in 3-gatsu no lion before that being Brian the sun, but i&#039;m simply glad this band sung the ending, it&#039;s the best song out of the entire series in my opinion, or rather, it&#039;s in a draw with every other song as they&#039;re all just perfect. the background music is still fantastic, the voice actors have lots of emotions into their voices and are very competent, especially Kana hanazawa as Hina.<br />
<br />
Overall:10/10, this show only gets better and better, the rating may change when i finish the show.

    A short review for those that are new to this anime. <br />
The second season of the highly appreciated anime 3-gatsu no Lion does not continue its former legacy, instead starts a new quest where most of the things you may have enjoyed in the first season are left aside only for the story to advance to a more social feeling. <br />
While the first season brought us face to face with the protagonist inner demons and allowed us to see how he faced them while dealing with the problems of a pro shogi player, in the second season everything starts recycling itself through a side character,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285238">
        a character that is over and over again praised as some goddess while doing just a plain fucking thing. Still, we are forced to see how the protagonist sees this character as some sort of salvation to his wounded soul. <br />
The protagonist family is also ignored while in the first season the protagonist sister seemed to be the storm that always managed to make the audience stand on their tiptoes as she was the materialized form of his inner demons. <br />
There we some good parts too, of course, but they were fragmented and only slightly extrapolated in comparison with the way the protagonist enlarges his social network. <br />
Lastly, at the end we are left with a slightly more ambiguous problem, the romance that seems to have bud between two characters that I couldn&#039;t even see one fucking reason to be together if this season didn&#039;t force me over and over again to see and accept. <br />
A humiliation for someone who expected to see the protagonist advance along his darkness while slowly dispelling it. A perfect story for anyone who didn&#039;t care about the connection between what was supposed to be and what it is.

    This Contains some spoilers.<br />
<br />
Even though this season wasn&#039;t as good as the previous one, It&#039;s still a good anime and with almost all reviews giving it a 10 I made this one to just talk about the flaws in the anime. <br />
There are 2 things that I genuinely didn&#039;t like in this season:<br />
<br />
The first flaw I found was the happy episodes, with the first season&#039;s most happy episodes were more about how the characters feel and how they realize the happiness and fortune they have but in this one it feels more like it&#039;s used to make or end relationships between character rather than focus

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275912">
        on how they actually feel or at least that&#039;s what it looked like to me in most episodes. <br />
<br />
The second flaw or more like part that I have a hate-like feeling towards was the drama, Now the drama was all over the place in this season, There were times when I wanted to cry for the characters and there were times when it just felt forced with no emotions behind it. <br />
I do have to say that it had outstanding moments like the matches between Shimada and Yanagihara which IMO in the top 3 arcs in the 2 seasons. <br />
<br />
Other than those 2 things I personally didn&#039;t like, the rest was great, The characters are still as good as season 1 tho it kinda felt like the mangaka is trying to push a relationship between Hinata and Kiriyama but other than that they were very good characters.<br />
<br />
The OSTs, Openings,Endings and voice acting were on point as usual. <br />
<br />
Overall I would give it a 7/10.<br />
<br />
I would love to see some more of this anime and I hope I don&#039;t get spoiled with some parts again.

    Sangatsu no Lion is an anime that challagens even the most boring lives in the world, an anime the vanquishes all sense of extraordinary and unique to portray the most average kind of drama someone could ever experience during adolescence.<br />
<br />
You see, the ideia behind it was kind of bold and creative, yet it&#039;s expected that an anime about shougi wouldn&#039;t be engaging at all. They never properly explain how to even play it to begin with and this director seems to absolutely love making a fuss over &quot;Should I play e7 or Be4?&quot;, nearly admitting this show is simply uncapable of depicting anything more entertaining.<br />
<br />
---Story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339551">
        ---<br />
<br />
The drama is pretty weak since they only touch on the same subject during the entire series. and I know &#039;bullying&#039; sounds like a cool and creative idea but I was already super done with it by the end of the show as they would never move from the ordinary &quot;This was unfair and I hate myself&quot;. It may be a credible depiction, but it still felt like reading a horoscope: the information may make sense, but the text is so vague that it&#039;s barely worth your attention.<br />
<br />
The worst part of all is that pretty much every episode has a 5 to 10 minutes scene whereas two friends of the protagonist decide what they&#039;ll have for dinner... Like, it&#039;s dumb, it&#039;s useless and I&#039;d always skip that shit.<br />
<br />
The comedy is filled up with super childish sound effects and weird zoom in&#039;s to the characters&#039; faces, like the director was unironically inspired by iCarly whilst writing those scripts.<br />
<br />
--- Characters ---<br />
<br />
All characters are boring. They barely have any background and their development is repetitive, always returning to those same fucking flashbacks of their childhood (just like Naruto, eh?).<br />
<br />
Rei&#039;s sister had some potential, as she&#039;s kinda mysterious in a cool manner and seems to have some complicated drama luring her past... but guess it: they only bother giving her one single scene during this entire season.<br />
<br />
--- Art &amp; Sound ----<br />
<br />
The facial expressions are lame. When the characters appear sad, they only bother stretching their mouth downwards in the most plastic way possible, like someone was forcing it on them with their fingertips.<br />
<br />
As I&#039;ve already mentioned, its sound effects are weird and there&#039;s nothing really special with its OST.<br />
<br />
--- Enjoyment ---<br />
<br />
In my opinion, a Slice of Life is more about its elements than the genre itself, and Sangatsu no Lion is an anime that wasn&#039;t able to save face with one of the weakest drama I&#039;ve ever seen and its awkward sense of humour. Of course I didn&#039;t enjoy it.<br />

    *Potential spoilers for Oyasumi Punpun          <br />

I once heard a saying that life is 90% shit and 10% good. I thought it was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever heard because at least you know there is at least 10% good to look forward to if nothing else. Being able to capture that little feeling of hope in a story is what makes or breaks most drama series <br />
<br />
3-gatsu no Lion is yet another entry into the sad boi genre but this time with 99.7% more shogi. <br />
<br />
	I would classify the first season of 3-gatsu

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332814">
        no Lion as a drama with slice of life elements. The opening scene has become something of a legend. We see the main character, Rei, slowly wake up and get out of bed as he starts his day. With just a few beautiful shots the viewer already understands that Rei has probably done this countless times, each time just as lost and without purpose. It is clear he is someone who has experienced pain and tragedy. This excellent story telling last for about all of five minutes before subtly is thrown out the window and is replaced with a million slow pans and grimacing face shots every time someone so much as says “hi”. At this point my PTSD was acting up as every series that focuses on depression flashed through my mind. I wondering when Rei was going to refuse to get into the robot and thought it was just a matter of time before he was going to go jerk off into the river by his house. Fortunately the direction changes, unfortunately that direction still isn’t spectacular. <br />
<br />
	I would classify the second season of 3-gatsu no Lion as a slice of life with drama elements. Rei&#039;s depression is healed for the most the part and I guess the story is over but it isn&#039;t. Instead, scenes of Rei moping about is changed to more scenes of food and other uneventful things. Much like every other slice of life there’s a lot of pointless bullshit, sometimes it works but most of the time you just want to kill yourself. Seeing Akari and Hina enamored with food is cute, but so are cat videos on Youtube and they take up much less of my precious time. At this point in the story I was only invested in seeing Rei&#039;s journey to be a shogi master given that is the only thing providing a sense of progression, however painfully slow it may be. <br />
<br />
	The tonal shifts between seasons leave me wanting. While it could be written off as Rei&#039;s journey I find that his transition from someone who was in such a dark place to someone who is partaking in high school club shenanigans is quite jarring. I don’t think it’s a problem with the tone being inconsistent per se but more so how fast it all happens with what little we’re given. While the second season tried to have some darker moments with the bullying arc it didn’t really work for me. It felt over the top, not necessarily impossible but just improbable given the lack of depth the situation had as a whole. We only know Chiho for about an episode before she is hospitalized for bullying? The teacher has a mental break down because all of the bullying situations over the years have caused her anxiety? Takagi’s reason for being a bully is because she is anxious about her future? For how dramatic everything was it needed to have a good sell and I just didn’t see it. In that sense I feel the first season had much more impact. <br />
<br />
	Despite the second season falling short in terms of the drama, it also focused more on the aspects of the series I enjoyed the most and that’s the backstory of all the shogi players and the psychology of the matches. Each and every player has their reasons for playing and their own demons to conquer. Though some of these could be considered a little cliché, I find it matches the tone the story has which tends be a little grand. I mean, I felt like some of these characters would literally die during the shogi matches the way they talk and act. I think the competitive aspect appealed to me because I use to play TCGs competitively back in the day and a lot of the psychology of winning, losing, and etc. is spot on in those environments. It&#039;s a long and dark road, and if you ever want to see the worst humanity has to offer just go to a Yu-Gi-Oh! tournament. That all being said, I&#039;d say I prefer the second season as a whole. <br />
<br />
	Overall 3-gatsu no Lion is a very interesting case. It falls into the pitfalls of both of its genres but they also kind of cancel each other out and then create new problems. The story plays it close to the line with their focus on Rei&#039;s angst, but the slice of life non-sense they shift to doesn&#039;t thrill me either. The story in general can&#039;t make up its mind, as it can be very realistic one moment, then go full anime the next. Through out this there are moments I like of course, but that’s just it- I felt like I was waiting for moments instead of enjoying the series as a whole. As for what those moments ultimately count for, I’d guess I’d say 3-gatsu no Lion is about 60% shit and 40% Akari.

    Althought I did enjoy the first season of this anime a good deal, this second season for me entered into the realm of profoundness.  Though the anime does revolve around the main character as a professional shouji player, I found that even I, with as little understanding of this japanese board game, was able to immensely enjoy this anime.<br />
  What this anime truly revolves around are the individuals surrounding the main character, and the lessons he learns from helping them through the hardships and trials they encounter within their own lives.  In turn he applies what he learned from overcoming these hardships

          <span style="display: none;" id="review268603">
        to his own life.  This anime to me exemplifies a journey of self discovery, a journey which as shown is this anime, is a cycle through suffering from uncertainty, and joy through the act of grabbing a hold of life.

    I&#039;m not gonna lie, I liked the first season of this, but I felt it fell a bit flat in the second half with it&#039;s focus on shogi, and less focus on Rei and his development with the characters around him. This season solves that. Let&#039;s start with this, I need to bleach my brain. Not because it&#039;s so bad that I want to unsee it, but because it&#039;s so good, that I won&#039;t be able to look at anime again, my expectations have exploded through the roof and hit FUCKING JUPITER. Let&#039;s start with the review. And note, there will be spoilers, and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272927">
        series is so good, watch it before reading the review, because I want to spoil nothing.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10. This arc focuses mostly on one thing, Hina, but does shift it&#039;s focus at times to look at other characters, including Nikaido and Rei&#039;s Shogi Science Club, but the main focus is Hina, or more specifically, Hina being bullied. This arc had some of the most realistic looks at bullying I&#039;ve ever seen, with actually messages sent out in very well done ways. It doesn&#039;t over exaggerate it, and yet, it perfectly illustrates how damaging bullying can be, and what it means to speak up. And that&#039;s not even mentioning how well it fit into the characters and story. Speaking of...<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10. It would be a lie to say I didn&#039;t love the sisters, Hina especially, but this season, heck, one scene, made her into a character so likable and complex, she may be my favorite character in all of anime. And that&#039;s not to say Rei isn&#039;t interesting either. He feels like a human, he has flaws and fears, and anxiety. He is pessimistic, but the way we see him grow from those around him (Newcomer Finals) and the way he learns to be happy is so refreshing. He feels complex too, carrying that darkness, but learning to accept the happiness around him.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10. The music is just good. I don&#039;t notice it during normal scenes, it&#039;s just kinda... there, but when the really serious scenes come on, it gets good, REALLY GOOD. The soundtrack is beautiful, adds to the emotions, to the point where you can cry for a pigeon or FRACKING RAMUNE CANDY. And the intro and outro really grew on me, so much so, I was sad to see it get a new one, but don&#039;t worry, the new one&#039;s good too. <br />
<br />
Art: 10/10. Yeah, order&#039;s messed up, but whatever. The art man, where do I begin. First of all, it&#039;s nothing like you&#039;ve seen before, looking like Your Lie in April met with Madoka Magica and Monogatari, with hatched eyes, long lips, beautiful usage of colors, and images and backgrounds so good looking, it gives 5 Centimeters per Second a run for its money. And then there&#039;s the changes in art. The art can go from it&#039;s normal, to cut out, to pencil, to these archaic sketches, and the odd part is, it looks good. It doesn&#039;t distract from the scene, in fact, it adds to it, giving it more power than if it were to stand alone. That&#039;s impressive, and this is possibly the best looking anime I&#039;ve ever watched. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10. I can&#039;t even begin. Certain episodes, I was inches from the screen, holding my breath. Other episodes, I was practically cheering (not practically) when they were over. This anime has brought me to tears of both sadness and happiness, and there were episodes where for all 24 and a half minutes (I don&#039;t watch the previews), I was smiling like an absolute idiot. I have never enjoyed an anime quite this much, and that&#039;s really saying something.<br />
<br />
Overall: Honestly, this anime should define an entire generation. It sadly was pretty overlooked since it didn&#039;t fall into the categories of &quot;fantasy&quot;, &quot;comedy&quot;, &quot;romance&quot;, &quot;sci-fi&quot; or &quot;shounen&quot;, making it very underwatched despite it&#039;s high ratings, but it deserves to be. This anime was breathtaking, with scenes so emotional and powerful, I couldn&#039;t breath, all I could do was stare at the visuals and listen to the music. It&#039;s down to earth and relatable, and the character development, story telling, and beautiful music and artistic symbolism, all that makes this anime a true gem. Now, is this the best anime I&#039;ve ever watched, very likely. I decided to let the season end before I decide, but so far, absolutely nothing can match the dramatic, heartwarming, beautiful masterpiece that is Sangatsu no Lion. If you hadn&#039;t seen it and watched the review anyways, go check it out, it&#039;s worth it.

    3-gatsu no Lion for me has always been one of the most overlooked anime I&#039;ve known.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know why, but no one seems to watch this show.<br />
<br />
And what a loss for these people. Time to tell them why!<br />
<br />
Story (9/10)<br />
<br />
This season had it all. Brilliantly written character drama for Hinata, sweet light hearted comedy from many lovable characters, great shogi and much more.<br />
<br />
The show is paced beautifully and knows when to use drama or comedy.<br />
<br />
The progression in story with real drama and with shogi was really effective separately and I&#039;m glad they went with this approach.<br />
<br />
It did slow down a lot in the second half with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275903">
        a couple of mediocre episodes but also had a couple of gems that made up for it.<br />
<br />
Overall, the story was an amazing experience for storytelling that more anime need.<br />
<br />
Characters (10/10)<br />
<br />
Rei grew immensely in the 1st season and I&#039;m glad that they used his development into effective use here.<br />
<br />
A person who despised himself, now tries to help others.<br />
<br />
And the main person he helps is Hinata.<br />
<br />
Hinata in this season, grew to become one of my favorite written characters ever.<br />
<br />
Her character was sympathetic and I felt pain for how she suffered.<br />
<br />
And from that, she developed in spades and yet, felt like such a real character.<br />
<br />
Then we have supports who were amazing when they were shown like Sakuratou and Shimada, whose shogi match was one of my favorite episodes this season with their motives and hearts shining.<br />
<br />
The writers know how to write them really well.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation (10/10)<br />
<br />
God bless SHAFT.<br />
<br />
All emotions were portrayed beautifully with gorgeous visuals.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10)<br />
<br />
The OPs and EDs were good, the voice acting was brilliant (especially KanaHana for Hinata) and the OST worked well.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9/10)<br />
<br />
I felt a rollercoaster of emotions with this show that hit really close to home at various times. Invested the entire time.<br />
<br />
Overall, 3-gatsu no Lion&#039;s 2nd season easily surpassed its first and was tremendous this season.<br />
<br />
Score 9/10

              Everyone is the main character of their own story , the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own is beautifully shown in 3-gatsu no Lion .<br />
<br />
3-gatsu no Lion is a diamond , lying in the deep ocean of jewels known as Anime.What does 3 gatsu no Lion do to make it different from any other Drama,Slice of life,Seinen and game genre anime?<br />
It BEAUTIFULLY Blends all of the genre and presents you this Masterpiece of an Anime..Does it fall short in any aspect? No it doesn&#039;t ,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302879">
        it never lets your expectations FALL ...It deserves Every single praise it receives....there&#039;s a reason why it is thee highest rated Game,Slice of life and Seinen genre anime on MAL(the only genre it is not the highest rated is Drama.. its #4 on drama)<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
Its SHAFT.......the animation in Season 1 was Amazing .. and SHAFT proves why it is praised of its Animation , Art , direction , and everything in 3-gatsu no Lion Season 2 ..There is no such thing as bad animation when SHAFT does it RIGHT..every aspect of the animation was amazing... the studio took the manga to new heights , their execution of every scene is PERFECT. The Art in 3-gatsu no Lion was breathtaking .. its looks nothing like any normal anime that comes out every season ..Anyone can look at the animation and art and tell that the animators put a lot of effort and work in the making of this Masterpiece. The Color and shades used in different places to show different emotions and feelings were done Amazingly .. Just looking at this Anime is a Feast to the eyes...<br />
<br />
Characters : 10/10<br />
One of the Biggest Factor why 3-gatsu no Lion is NOT YOUR NORMAL ANIME ... it is shown from the 1st season that every character in the story has its own story and they are they main character of their own.. when every a tournament arc start .. most anime just doesn&#039;t show much about the &#039;opponents&#039; or the side characters that face the mc.... 3-gatsu no Lion DOES IT RIGHT .... they gives each opponent their story and even devote half of an episode on them , even the side characters which probably wont appear much or opponents which wont appear after their match with REI are gives proper motives and Determination for the reason they are competing...Their is a lot of Character development for Rei in Season 2 .....There is a TON of Character development for each and every character ... The character interaction is really Heartwarming and lovely ...<br />
<br />
Story : 10/10<br />
The season starts of with a half a year gap from season 1 ..it takes a VERY strong start .. it easily rivals or peaks the whole season 1 with this Arc ... The arc starts from episode 4 to episode 13 .. we get on an emotional roller-coaster from the start of this arc ...The story keeps moving forward and takes great steps .. every part of story takes the right steps ... season 2&#039;s story and its characters felt better because ,they did such an improvements from their minor faults from season 1 .. all the other arc hit all the right points and the outcome is beautiful ... they have adapted the manga till chapter 84-85 , i am eagerly waiting for the season 3 instead of reading the manga ... because of &quot;SHAFT&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10 <br />
ALL the OP and ED were ABSOLUTELY AMAZING ..from their animation to the music .. they nailed every aspect of it .. all the Ost&#039;s are great...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:10/10<br />
The experience of watch 3-gatsu no lion was just something you don&#039;t get from other anime .. i starting watching this anime with high expectation seeing that its season 2 is #8 ranked with 9.05 ...and after watching san - gatsu .. it blew my exceptions !! .. i didn&#039;t fell like i should just binge watch the anime , it has a unique charm to it which made me what to experience it in the best way possible.  The HEARTWARMING moments in the anime are truly amazing.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10 <br />
Its an Anime which handles each aspect of the genre wonderfully... Its just sad that not many people have seen this Masterpiece....i hope they maintain the bar they have set with the 3rd season and i hope they even exceed it ...
