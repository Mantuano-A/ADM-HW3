    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
Odd taxi is pretty cool, the series was mature without being a gore and sex fest, portrayed a setting that was slightly imaginative but very conceivable, so that this setting could be discussed in earnest, and delivered, moreover, exactly what fans were expecting - well, many of them, in any case. All thing considered the presentation almost reminded me as if Rockstar games was behind it especially Odokawa’s shirt style was kind of the same with Tommy Vercetti’s.<br />
<br />
What I like about the series is that I found the writing here was strong, the show really built up to anything since the very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405204">
        beginning. The story was quite grand and as it goes on we’d move onto bigger mysteries with bigger stakes, added to the fact they do a great job creating such a huge cast of characters, together with their own individual stories that culminating into one single major event. Despite having interconnected stories, your characters always interacted. The series in general was quite heavy in exposition and It’s not that the characters always have something worthwhile to say, but the dialogues will just keep you engaged, and a lot of attention must be given in what certain characters said or doing and it’s rewarding in the end.<br />
<br />
I’m willing to defend the criticism of as to why the show feels the needs to use the inhabitants with animals. They are quite pedestrians, they have Japanese names, there is no bigotry; one species can marry with different one, they use twitter, YouTube even doing gatcha, so why not use normal human instead? I’d argue first of all, even without any kind of depth analysis using animal as the basic design was really fitting with the overall animation style which reminded me a lot of western cartoon. Secondly it just makes the characters so memorable; a lot of the time anime suffers from ‘same face syndrome’ that just plagues the memorability of some characters they had. In Odd Taxi everyone is memorable despite the huge cast of the characters. Last but not least, the usage of animal as inhabitants of the setting had something to do with the nature psychology or mental state of the main character and I’ll just let you to watch the show to figure out what I meant.<br />
<br />
Having said that the show is not devoid with criticism. First is that not all stories are made equal. Well, of course, right? Even if this was somehow possible, tastes will come into play. Nevertheless, I could barely keep myself interested during Kakihana’s story. It really just something You already seen hundred of times before and you just going to know how it will end, he was just a pathetic character.<br />
<br />
Speaking of characters, man a lot of this characters were simple minded and one dimensional at best. Kakihana just wants a cute girlfriend and it doesn’t matter if she conning you or not. Yano just talking in rap and that’s the only thing about him, Imai just love Idols, some characters risking their life on gacha, some characters just wants to get viral and so on so forth. <br />
<br />
A lot of the time the events reliant on coincidences; certain characters magically found a weapon out of nowhere, character got saved from death because they&#039;re apparently have lucky item in their posession or some characters making sudden appearance out of nowhere to save the day etc. Like a lot of corny anime, this anime is fixated on the ideas of forgiveness and redemption. I just can’t believe some characters were just not dead (apart from the original murder case) and forgiven considering the tone and the overall thing with Yakuza, Criminal and stuff.<br />
<br />
Visually it really wasn’t the best. Overall it was fine but most of scenes with cars was replaced with CG, making all the action scenes looks very jarring. The overall characters design was fine but they definitely not really stand out like Beastar.<br />
<br />
As for sound, I like it. The voice acting was superb, it consists not only a famous artist like Hanae Natsuki who does Odokawa superbly but also a lot of other voice actors who maybe not as known, but they really really do deliver especially characters like Dobu and Shiragaki. Most of the time the sound was muted or with only the sound of car were present that just giving more grip for attenttion to the dialogues. The OP was quite nice and kind of giving a cozy vibe before getting into the anime and the ED just shows one of the features in the show which is an idol. All in all, the sound department were absolutely spot on.<br />
<br />
But for the most part, the anime’s charm outweighs its faults. I would recommend Odd Taxi, This is not a series where lots of friendship will overcome obstacles, depending your precious imoutos and childhood friends, awe-inspiring student council leaders who can do it all, so on and so forth. This has been such a fun series with an intriguing and serious mystery. The depth and breadth of reinterpretations of Tokyo is quite impressive. The amount of cast were large but they were very compelling, each with their own mini character arcs to follow. Not all of them were perfect but so is fictions. <br />

    Odd Taxi is really good, but its reception is a little warped, as it seems to have found itself in this weird situation of being fairly obscure, but also highly overrated by those who actually know about it, and this is dangerous because it leads to a hugbox where no one is willing to offer negative critique. Odd Taxi is a refreshing and clever mix of genres and styles, and it tells a complex but ultimately grounded and human story steeped in its well-construed mystery. Many have compared it’s conversational tone to that of Quentin Tarantino films, and as long as they’re referring exclusively to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405191">
        Reservoir Dogs, The Hateful Eight, and perhaps just a tiny bit of Pulp Fiction, I might have to agree, and much like those movies, this was seemingly written by a prodigy. It’s not often you see something like this, but the person behind Odd Taxi’s incredible dialogue and pacing is a writer with no other credits to their name, so either they’re a genius, or their beginner&#039;s luck is working insane amounts of overtime. With all that being said, however, Odd Taxi is no masterpiece, and it’s ironic too, because some aspects of the show are so strong, they’re almost held back by other elements which don’t quite pull their own weight. It’s themes of self-esteem are very mature and perceptive, but they’re almost too ingrained in seemingly irrelevant and thereby misleadingly innocuous visual symbols, so one would hardly be at fault for assuming this show had nothing to say at all until the very end when it clearly explains itself to anyone not paying close enough attention. It’s subpar voice acting almost undercuts how good the dialogue is, and visually, the ugly CG cars make the otherwise perfectly constructed atmosphere of the show feel less complete then it had any right feeling. And speaking of the mood, the music is often some of the best around, but then during some casual conversations, it’ll play this obnoxious semi-comedic track which just kills the realism the script worked so hard to instate. <br />
<br />
But these are borderline nitpicks. Forgive me for feeling the need to selfishly impose my worldview like this, but personally, I believe that while idiots who call dog shit a masterpiece are just funny to laugh at, people who call quality entertainment a masterpiece when it doesn’t quite deserve it are worth challenging, because we owe it to the creators of good and thoughtful anime to offer their work good and thoughtful critique. Provided this, it’s time to gush. Odd Taxi is great, and personally, I found it shockingly compelling. It’s comedy is not only genuinely funny, but it never overstays its welcome and is weaved through conversation naturally. It has a real sense of wittiness, and constantly capitalizes on its ability to establish unique and diverse character personalities one after another. The main character, Odokawa, is this autistic, jaded, contrarian, middle-aged asshole, and having realized this was a show which was actually going to have real-feeling characters, I immediately knew it’s praise was warranted, because as basic of a feat as this may seem, little TV can achieve even one character who is this well-realized, and Odd Taxi has countless. It’s just so good at capturing subtle fluctuations in awkwardness and intimacy in conversation that every personality feels well-balanced and sensible, and despite its ostensibly silly character designs (which scream their thematic relevance), the actual characterization is nothing if not lifelike. The art design and backgrounds aren’t mind-blowing, but they’re far better drawn, more detailed, and more aesthetically adherent than 99.9% of anime airing these days, and overall, it remains a lovely little show throughout all its twists and turns. While I hope this review can distinguish itself from the mass of overtly unbridled praise many of its fans are showering this show with, I must admit I very quickly began to adore this show, and I believe anyone who can appreciate a script which is honestly too good for its own good will feel the same way.<br />

    THIS IS A HIGH AND TALL ORDER PSA: Aside that this will be a VERY HEAVILY NON-SPOILERY review, go figure out things yourself if you truly want to enjoy Odd Taxi to the fullest. And I highly swear by my guarantee: the rewarding payoff is much better that way. This is a criminally underrated, underwatched/overlooked hidden diamond gem of an intrically made complex and gobsmacking show YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS OUT ON!<br />
<br />
In my very honest-to-marvellous-greatness, this show a.k.a Odd Taxi has been far in the way, the most frustratingly challenging review of all time for me to pen down a non-spoilery review in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405193">
        a very long time (that gives me headaches of the absurdly mind-boggling kind), simply because:<br />
- It not just joins in the fray of 2021&#039;s setting of &quot;ridiculously, notoriously high standard&quot; bars of original anime of the likes of Wonder Egg Priority or even Vivy: Fluorite Eye&#039;s Song;<br />
- Not just because it&#039;s gonna be a modern-day cult classic of a masterpiece through and through;<br />
- Heck, not even its subverting setting and themes which encapsulates everything about an ARG-like film noir;<br />
BUT BECAUSE IT&#039;S HEAVILY SLEPT UPON by the anime community which gives no two flying Fs about anthropomorphic &quot;furry&quot; shows that Odd Taxi is one, but not at the same time. It&#039;s a devastating shame that only those of us (like me) whom have watched this show can appreciate that Odd Taxi is NO DOUBT THE BEST ANIME of the Spring 2021 season that no one is watching, BAR NONE! And it&#039;s massively thanks to the production staff at P.I.C.S (for the most part with director Baki Kinoshita and scriptwriter-cum-series composer Kazuya Konomoto) and OLM&#039;s Team Yoshioka for giving us such a tightly compact, outstanding, pièce de résistance masterpiece of a brillantly thought-out mystery thriller of a show that&#039;s unlike anything ever seen in anime before (lest if you count Durarara!, Baccano, or even &quot;Sayonara, Zetsubou Sensei&quot; in that sense).<br />
<br />
You know me: If you&#039;re reading this review, you know that like many others outside of MAL in Reddit or even in a specialized Discord group have been discussing and sharing potential theories for the last 3 months when this show was airing, I might not be the first to jump into that gun. But not just in the very elaborate episodic discussions (that I felt like I was the Sensei dishing out those answers to everyone who are lazy in being detective sleuths, which I say: &quot;Why the hell are you lazy-bums?&quot;), the real joy of enjoying Odd Taxi to the fullest is to be like Sherlock Holmes, going in-depth with people who are like-minded and try to figure out the 5W1Hs of how everything came to be from the very beginning. It&#039;s very low-key in wanting to accomplish its &quot;Inception&quot; like thematics, and both Baki Kinoshita and Kazuya Konomoto really did use all of the mixed media mediums to corporate all of the &quot;occult&quot;-style hidden juxtapositions that is meant for the audience to truly be Odd Taxi&#039;s version of Holmes, both in and out of the anime. The film noir we didn&#039;t know we needed, and it was a total blast from start to finish.<br />
<br />
Just for context, let me give you the preface of what Odd Taxi is about: <br />
&quot;41-year-old Hiroshi Odokawa is is an eccentric, reticent talking walrus of a taxi driver, who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.&quot; If you&#039;re thinking that this premise does sound &quot;Odd&quot;, given its very aptly named title, that&#039;s because it purposefully meant to be a subtle and covert message that everything that happens within this show, NOTHING happens out of coincidence: everything is intertwined together, one way or another, even in the smallest of ways that brings the setting and characters together for such &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; events like this. Don&#039;t blink, or you might miss a beat and rewind 10 seconds to see the untold messages. So strap in your seat belts, folks! We&#039;re going where the night is right, the city lights are bright, and the conversations are tight in this very strange and peculiar world named Odd Taxi.<br />
<br />
Before that, I would also like to preface what is the company P.I.C.S all about from the debut director Baki Kinoshita himself (most of which was taken from the ANN interview and changed for nuance, so plagiarism issue solved);<br />
P.I.C.S is a production company that handles all kinds of visual works, including advertisements, music videos, live footage, dramas, and films. Serving the role of a character designer and animation director, Kinoshita&#039;s impetus for working on TV shows is his desire to create an entertainment work with dramatic elements that depict character growth, which sadly can&#039;t be gotten out of a commercial or a oneshot comedy (his inspiration being influenced by Studio Ghibli and Satoshi Kon&#039;s works, which it all finally clicks). Working together in the amazingly tightly-packed script for Odd Taxi with writer Kazuya Konomoto (his other work being a hidden gem of a manga: Setoutsumi), I&#039;ll just slot a PR for this: Go and read Setoutsumi (which I did before penning this review down), the story itself is conventional to the tropes and clichés of the modern age, but what the hell that Konomoto did was to flip it entirely on its head, giving a whole new rhyme and feeling to his creative inventiveness that &quot;nothing and everything made sense&quot;. After watching Odd Taxi and reflecting back on Setoutsumi, it is very clear on its succinct approach to creative storytelling that will blow the minds of people.<br />
<br />
Back to Odd Taxi, Kinoshita is the character designer, and Konomoto is the scriptwriter and series composer. He had the loose idea for things like an individual taxi driver, but Konomoto was the one who fleshed out the characters and plot beats, as is the story with juxtapositioning ironic and enjoyable comedy elements with the darkness of society with the tight refines with the sense of balance is very tonely refined (which I can firmly say that I&#039;ve really been taken aback each and every episode). The narrative structure, the meticulous foreshadowing, the characterization…every element is superb in his view, as is the script for the show (AND YOU&#039;RE GODDAMN RIGHT IT WAS!). The key to Odd Taxi&#039;s eccentricness was the decision to go anthropomorphic with animals instead of humans, a realistic story about the human condition with cute animal visuals. If a heavy story has a cute-looking surface, it mitigates the feeling of gloominess and expands the scope of the story. Both him and Konomoto had confidence that the dissonance brought out by the contrast would be compelling, and that&#039;s not just to say about the foreshadowing weaved throughout the entire story. There will be mysteries right to the very end, so the elements are quite strongly pronounced. At the point when the mysteries are being solved, you can see the backbone of the characters, then feel the drama...it&#039;s an anime that juggles both its mystery and its human drama elements to an equal (but insane perfection of a) degree.<br />
<br />
Another key element of Odd Taxi, was getting the voice actors that are a complete un-hoax of an unorthodox (aside from the famous ones), that along with the entire mystery of Odd Taxi, brings another compelling reason why this show is SO doggone perfect. Casting Natsuki Hanae as the cynical 41-year-old Walrus, you&#039;ve heard his voice go around a lot recently thanks to his massively successful role as Kimetsu no Yaiba&#039;s lead MC Tanjirou Kamado. So for Kinoshita to cast him (which does not sound like Natsuki-san&#039;s voice at all), it was an interesting choice nonetheless to potray the kind of character who became an adult while dragging along his childlike heart. To be frank, Kinoshita didn&#039;t want to make him the typical middle-aged guy with a gruff and austere attitude, but wanted to express his internal youth and purity of his heart. Odokawa may have a cold side, but he makes witty retorts and his conversations bring out his youth as not just an older guy who has given up on various aspects of his life. And as such, Natsuki Hanae&#039;s portrait of Odokawa as the middle-aged guy, while also bringing out his cool and collected side, has energy and vigor in the depths of his voice, and is a perfect suit for Odokawa. Also, the comedic conversations and verbal exchanges are a very important part, so Kinoshita wanted to get professional comedians involved for those (the comedic duo of the Homosapiens: rhino Shibakagi and horse Baba, voiced by entertainers from the Yoshimoto Kogyo talent agency: Yuusuke and Atsuhiro Tsuda respectively). In order to bring out the feeling of reality when it comes to the gaps in conversations and the warmth, the pre-score voices are recorded ahead of time and afterwards made the images match them. This unorthodox approach follows up to the cast for some examples (who are complete unknowns): the Daimon brothers with Kousei and Asei, Taichi Kabasawa with Takashi, heck even rapper METEOR got in the fun being the &quot;Handshake&quot; porcupine-rapping Yano. These so-called pseudonym-but-real VAs are not what you typically expect of the anime industry, so to see Kinoshita going far as to recruit actual real-life prominent figures makes the icing on the cake much sweeter.<br />
<br />
If you wanna understand how much Odd Taxi is playing hooky with the audience, let me direct you to these references (again, NON-SPOILERY):<br />
- First and foremost, is the YouTube MV for the OP of Odd Taxi. Sure, as is every full-length song that you could find on Spotify that you can hear if it&#039;s your favourite songs of the season, even with the cool anime OP visuals, Baki Kinoshita goes one step further into integrating the anime scenes with the MV, making it look like a sneaky, non-canon of a foreshadowing sequence of events. There are a lot of scenes to take in, because as you constantly watch the anime and go back to the MV, that is where the sublime mystery all clicks up. Even to the point of getting famous rappers such as OMSB, METEOR and VaVa, as is comedians Yuusuke and Atsuhiro Tsuda, along with typical anime VAs Riho Iida and Saori Terai, all of them are a teaser to what the anime has going for its progression. Other than that, Odd Taxi&#039;s OP by Wataru Sawabe (Skirt) and PUNPEE is a total blast of a catchy, laid-back, low-fi, city pop of a juggernaut song that gives the whole anime a peace vibe of a mood. Honestly though, the Spring season has a lot of good (and few amazing like Vivy, 86, Megalo Box 2: Nomad) OSTs, but Odd Taxi knows how to hit with full cylinders pumping, and as such, it&#039;s the No. 1 spot of OPs for me this season, NO QUESTION. I just love this song to bits, and only Odd Taxi watchers can follow up with that vibe. The ED with Suzuko Mimori and the insert songs with its pseudonymly named &quot;Mystery Kiss&quot; group, it can take a while to get used to the various idol songs, but it&#039;s all good as well.<br />
- Secondly, it&#039;s the official YouTube channel, which also has a non-canon hidden story about normal objects, which is intricately placed in the anime in full hidden view, and used as devices to snively record normal day-to-day conversations that would have been otherwise classified as an &quot;Extras&quot; of sorts. Hey y&#039;all, these are MORE than just your typical &quot;Extras&quot;, they are also integral to piecing the smaller puzzle pieces with the main plot. By the time this review is up, most (if not all) of the audio drama would&#039;ve been fully translated and posted on YouTube or even the compact Fandom page (which I DO NOT recommend to go in the early stages because of heavy spoilers lest you searched for something else, only go there once you&#039;re 3 episodes deep into it).<br />
- Thirdly, is the official character cast graph. I&#039;d highly doubt that most of you would&#039;ve made the effort to scour the official Japanese website when the anime started airing for the character cast (and some that actually caught on), but a few wittingly apt people have already made the translations to the big picture of the character connections, so the information is readily available at the places you will expect. Again, please DO NOT spoil yourself by referring to it early on, you&#039;re doing a major disservice to yourself (unless you&#039;re watching it and need some help).<br />
- Last but not least, it&#039;s a rando Twitter account that is also non-canon to the story, AND YES, you&#039;re hearing it correctly. I&#039;ve already hidden that link in the discussion forum (you should be able to identify as much from my shared topic), so please check that out also. You should already get the gist that it&#039;s also a small integral part to the Odd Taxi story.<br />
<br />
I understand why you&#039;ll want to get a studio such as OLM, popular for the Pokémon series, to create such a kiddy feel of a show that doesn&#039;t detract the visuals amidst a film noir-like mystery thriller masterpiece show in the making. OLM&#039;s Team Yoshioka having only done a few shows and films made for kids, and Odd Taxi lends that abstractness to the team&#039;s unique calibre. It&#039;s definitely an unique piece of media, made by a unique production team, crafted by well thought-out people, that only the people who watch Odd Taxi (like yours truly), will find this to be a modern day triumph of a sensational showpiece figure of a cult classic for the 2020s.<br />
<br />
If Quentin Tarantino had a side job that he would&#039;ve like to produce an anime for, Odd Taxi would be one to fit within his brilliantly crafted mindset that will always aim to play mindgames with the audience, and you&#039;ll be seeing twice or more with the &quot;Inception&quot; like feel that will never get old. Nevertheless, I BEG ON MY KNEES (even with a Dogeza) to ask you to watch Odd Taxi, this is THE one show where nobody gives a crap about &quot;furry&quot; shows. But laying deep within the rabbit hole, is a thriller story beyond anything you could ever imagine to come out of the anime spectrum. An abnormally peculiar rare show that you won&#039;t find anywhere else (that I&#039;ll ever swear until my time has come), and a tremendously ironic, yet surrealistic monumental classic for the ages.<br />
<br />
That said, GO WATCH ODD TAXI! STOP SLEEPING ON IT! This is unanimously easily my absolute favourite AOTS, even down to being an undisputed AOTY with a double-confirm plus chop with so many big hits registered in 2021 alone.

Have you ever thought of watching a walrus talk his way out of gunpoint with such passive-aggressive tone that you start wondering who is actually holding the gun? Have you ever thought of watching an alpaca who is doing capoeira move queixada to lofi-boss music?! Yeah, no... Me neither, but I Frinkin&#039; Love It.<br />
<br />
This show has brought a breath of fresh air and is doing it right. Good sounding opening, amazing voice actors, characters which have bigger personality than my future and story with so much potential that I think I just saw new Quentin Tarantino&#039;s indie anime project. (Gigguk also mentioned this,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394569">
        but I swear I did not know :D, world is really smalll)<br />
<br />
This show has really came out of nowhere and it really did not have an impact when I was reading the synopsis during my usual planning of seasonal watchlist, but I gave it a chance nevertheless and I am glad I did. And you should too!<br />

    Odd Taxi is one anime that certainly lives up to its title. It is very odd indeed. The director is a complete unknown and this is his first project. The writer is another rookie and this is literally his first work as a professional writer! Odd Taxi was not based on a manga or LN or game. It&#039;s a completely original IP. To make things even stranger, it&#039;s being animated by Oriental Lights and Magic, the studio responsible for the 1997 Berserk, the first seasons of Pokemon, and a bunch of 80s and 90s anime. I had no idea they still existed! I thought they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405287">
        had gone bankrupt eons ago! <br />
<br />
So what is Odd Taxi about? It&#039;s about a cynical, smartass Walrus who works as a taxi driver in a city filled with anthropomorphic animals. So this is like Crunchyroll&#039;s attempt to compete with Netflix&#039;s Beastars right? WRONG. Despite the fact all the characters are animals, they never act like animals. They live in Tokyo and not some Zootopia city like in Beastars. Culture and technology is just like in the real world. Beastars completely revolves around the predator vs. prey dichotomy. Odd Taxi is not focused on that kind of stuff at all. Instead, it&#039;s actually a mystery/crime drama. <br />
<br />
One thing people will immediately notice about Odd Taxi is the sheer number of characters and simultaneous sub-plots. These 13 episodes are as densely packed as a neutron star! Yet this isn&#039;t because the studio was rushing to cram a bunch of manga into a limited episode run. It was written like this completely on purpose! Some people have compared this to Baccano, but that isn&#039;t an accurate comparison. Baccano only confuses people because it skips around in time. The LN is more complex, but Bacanno&#039;s anime only has 2 main plotlines, 1 sub-plot, and a frame narrative. It can be simplified down to: The fight with Szilard, Flying Pussyfoot, The search for Dallas, and Gustav with Carol. If it was told sequentially, people wouldn&#039;t think it was complicated. Odd Taxi is an entirely different animal! Pun intended. It has about 13-15 different sub-plots depending on how you&#039;re counting. This makes it very difficult to keep up with if you&#039;re watching on a weekly basis and not discussing it with other people. I would definitely recommend watching this show in a few sittings. <br />
<br />
There are some anime that are great because of the feels or how they tackle a certain topic or how they capture some theme. That&#039;s not really what Odd Taxi is about. This is a mystery/puzzle anime. That sadly means the more I talk about it, the more I risk spoiling something. There are some series where spoilers don&#039;t matter. I went into Ashita no Joe already knowing almost everything that was going to happen and it didn&#039;t make a difference. Odd Taxi is a bit closer to the film Memento. Spoilers would definitely have made a negative impact. That&#039;s also one reason I&#039;m not sure how well this will hold up upon rewatching it. It has some really strong aspects like the dialogue, but I&#039;m not sure the mystery will have quite the same punch the second time.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not going to sugarcoat it, the art is not great. The animal character designs are fun, but the actual animation is fairly cheap at times. The CG cars also look straight out of 2007. I think Killer Bean might have better looking cars. At least the soundtrack makes up for this. The OST is genuinely pretty darn good.<br />
<br />
Odd Taxi very well might be the best new anime of spring 2021. I haven&#039;t seen &quot;To Your Eternity&quot; because I don&#039;t like to watch shows that are THAT hyped while they are airing. Despite that, my feelings on Odd Taxi are honestly a little mixed. I think it&#039;s one of the most unique modern anime I&#039;ve seen in quite a while. I think it was an incredibly laudable first effort for both its writer and director. However, it&#039;s not a series that I&#039;m instantly adding to my extended favorites. It&#039;s so densely packed and confusing that there was never one single moment or episode where I  thought &quot;BOOM! this is getting added to my faves!&quot; It still might be added at some point because it is very good, but I&#039;ll have to re-watch it again. It&#039;s unfortunate MAL only allows you to review an anime once. I&#039;d actually love to review this title again after sitting through it a second time!

    “I thought you and I were following the same road. You’re telling me we were actually on the highway and subway?”-Kensuke Shibagaki<br />
<br />
Odd Taxi is a huge metaphor for making money as you ride your taxi on the road of life. If you don’t make money, you can’t continue driving. Every detour or pitstop is indicated by themes of debt, taking loans, black market competition, clout-chasing, inhumane work conditions, work inequality, and scams. And it doesn’t just showcase the problems but it shows how deep in this cycle of capitalism the characters are in. They’re on their own in this world. It sucks but it’s a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405225">
        reality for a lot of people in the real world as well.<br />
<br />
It’s hard to explain what the story is without diving into spoilers, so all that needs to be known by the audience is that our main protagonist, the walrus named Odokawa, is quite literally and metaphorically in the driver’s seat as he takes the viewers on a trip to unravel the world of animal-Tokyo. The disappearance of a high school girl appears to be the only mystery, but the unnamed mysteries of the show are what is going on in what should be a normal Japanese urban city. The characters act completely human despite being represented as animals, and as the viewer, one can help but wonder if it is just a simple creative choice. Why are they animals? See if you can figure that out.<br />
<br />
The last understanding that must be had is the overall structure of Odd Taxi: it’s almost like a character study of Tokyo residents, but goes way farther than that by capturing the criminal underworld as well. Seemingly, very few of these characters have any relation to each other, but as the little interactions build up, a butterfly effect of unfounded proportions reaches the bombastic conclusion. It’s impossible to talk about a character-driven story without talking about the characters so let’s ‘shift gears’.<br />
<br />
The characters feel authentic. All are flawed to a believable extent in a society corrupted by capitalism. Every inherent flaw can be connected to money or social status. It should also be noted that not many characters die/have motives to kill, and it makes sense because the characters are not motivated by bloodlust, but by a desire to earn money or gain higher social status for whatever reason. I will be talking about just 3 in this short review:<br />
<br />
Odokawa is our unreliable monotone narrator driving us through a road of hidden details. With no introduction at all, the first episode shows a mysterious object falling to the bottom of the sea before Odokawa suddenly wakes up from his nap under his rumpled newspaper, and hears the news from his taxi radio player. Everything we learn about Odokawa occurs through his dialogue with his passengers. With enough dry humor, character chemistry, and actions to characterize who he is as a person, we learn about what he values and who he is as a person. For example, the worsening circumstances Odokawa is involved in drives both selfish acts of vengeance and selfless actions of platonic love in dire situations. He is not afraid to pass by as a simple bystander nor hit the gas pedal and go as far as necessary to get involved with shady business. He is the perfect protagonist in terms of complexity and flaws. In a world of crime he lives in, the series is beautiful at what it does through the mysterious vision of Odokawa. The reason this is possible is because our suspicious taxi driver also trusts very few people himself. His only allies are friends from long ago and idiots. Yet even with all this information, the mystery continues. Nothing about Odokawa’s past is revealed by Odokawa himself other than extremely limited use of PTSD. The mystery of who Odokawa is and what are his morals will linger until the last episodes. He is a 41-year old man we don’t understand but want to learn more about. He is, simply put, intriguing. <br />
<br />
/*Character Background Spoilers in the Next 2 Paragraphs*/<br />
<br />
In the backseat of Odokawa’s taxi is our friendly underworld criminal, Dobu, Odd Taxi’s primary antagonist. His goal is simple: to win against his rival in the capitalistic competition of pleasing his higher-ups. He’s a worker who wants his ‘product’ of his work to be chosen. How he attempts to achieve this goal is through Odokawa. Although he is an underworld criminal, he’s not quite the overly violent man the media suspects him to be. Dobu manipulates others while also trying to work with them rather than relying solely on fear, almost as if he’s a trustworthy devil offering a contract. That makes his character much more believable, because in the real world, underworld criminals do not purposely attract attention. He’s the desperate cunning criminal that threatens gun violence without pulling the trigger, because he wants to maintain control. Yet, it’s surprising. Even despite his criminal decisions, there are times when Dobu makes sacrifices of his own despite his overt control over characters in the show. There are moments where it’s hard not to sympathize with him, because he is another individual blinded by the system.<br />
<br />
Although there are a myriad of other characters to talk about, the last individual I would like to mention is Tanaka. Raised financially stable by both his parents, Tanaka is someone who lived an innocent life without understanding the principle of materialism until 3rd grade. He was a normal kid intrigued by the idea of collector’s items. Through the eyes of this ignorant kid, we see his infatuation for material items as he grows up from elementary schooler to adult in the workplace. Despite even measures by his communist 3rd grade teacher to teach his classroom the meaning of ‘equality’, the audience learns Tanaka’s self-worth through the metaphor of a dodo bird as he struggles with loneliness and lack of purpose throughout his whole life. As we move across the escalator of his life, and see him fall for scams, fail to make friends, suffer physical abuse from his family, and lead a life of a spending addiction, his values and mental health deteriorate, particularly with the discovery of gatcha gaming, the hidden money siphon of the capitalist world. Through Tanaka’s character study, we learn of the tragic circumstances that lead to who he becomes today. <br />

Unfortunately, just like the Odd Taxi anime, this review is now pulling the brakes. An immersive experience like Odd Taxi has not appeared in the anime community since the likes of Made in Abyss. I highly encourage watching it for the accumulation of unraveling details about this Tokyo-like city, plagued with the problems of capitalism and how it explores each individual in detail, and how we’re all connected under it. It’s a wild ride. It would be ‘odd’ if it wasn’t. (Please laugh.) The question the anime leaves you is this: Will you be the one in the driver’s seat?

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS<br />
After getting a lot of complaints about the old odd taxi review I’m updating it after seeing this trainwreck in full. <br />
<br />
Story 2/10 <br />
To start, the story makes little to no sense and it and the subplots, that it rushes trough, are meaningless. The first plot we have is a body of an idol band member that was found in a river and we have to figure out who the killer is. Now we follow some clues about the killer and wait what&#039;s that? Oh no another plot now it’s about a lottery heist? What? And like 5 subplots with different

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405456">
        characters? Not to mention Odokawa’s backstory, which feels as if it was adlibbed in the last episode. And then you bring back the murder plot and just reveal it in 2 episodes, while the heist plot is running along? Honestly, the worst part is who the killer was. (I’m not going to reveal it, but it makes zero sense and we were never given any hints it was he/her).<br />
<br />
Art 2/10<br />
God I hate the art in this show. Some parts are drawn simplistically like no effort was put into it. Some are drawn really well and then there is the occasional awful CGI. Also in the last episode they refuse to animate stuff like birds flapping their wings. They care so little, they won’t even animate that. And don’t excuse it with Odokawa’s condition, that’s just dishonest.<br />
<br />
Sound 5/10 <br />
Nothing big just decent. There are some really bad sound effects like when Hajime shows up.<br />
<br />
Characters 2/10<br />
<br />
Story of Hajime <br />
Hajime is a gambling addicted cat whose story we are introduced to in Episode 4. Now this character is so badly written it’s funny. He wants to buy an eraser to get popular in school but gets scammed and gets beaten by his dad. Now that is already a dumb plot point, but it gets worse when we follow him into adulthood and see him as an office worker playing a gacha game. He spots the scammer from his childhood in the game and sees that he is at the top of the score board. So like any rational person he starts wasting his money getting a dodo bird so he could beat him. He manages to get it but almost gets ran over by Odokawa, because - like a dumbass - he was standing in the middle of the road. He loses his phone and goes crazy, wanting to murder Odokawa. Now that is hilariously bad writing, but it gets even worse with shitty sound effects that play every single time he appears on screen.<br />
<br />
Story of Yano<br />
In TV Shows and Film, there are a lot of characters, who are memorable because of how unlikeable they are. Often times you have to commend those, who play them for being able to display such an unlikeable personality. But with Yano, you don’t have that. He isn’t actually evil enough for you to hate him, nor does he have any relatable traits. He is just really annoying. There’s a difference between being bad and being annoying. Rapping all of his lines for no good reasons is the latter. And you just end up asking yourself: “Why would anyone work for him?”<br />
<br />
Story of Miho<br />
Miho is played around as Odokawa’s love interest, but they really never do anything with her. Similar to some other moments, she is used as a shitty plot device to get Odokawa out of trouble. Teleporting into an empty warehouse area to dance off or pulling a 100kg man out of a car that is deep under water. Like her ears would not burst or she could even lift him from there.<br />
<br />
Police duo.<br />
The police duos hate taxi drivers for no reason and that is why they refuse to help Odokawa. It’s really not explained well and makes no sense, but hey they aren’t important at the end. Like what role did they fulfill in the end, that could’ve not been done in any other way? They are simply there as milestones and enablers to the unnecessarily convoluted plot.<br />
<br />
Kensuke and Atsuya<br />
They have some of the most cliché plots in the entire anime. Its the old plot of &quot;Oh no my friend is becoming more popular than me and he won’t spend time with me waah&quot;. They are also put into dumb situtations, where they are tied to main characters because the plot needs them there (most notably Kensuke working in a random restaurant, where Hajime tracks down Odokawa). Similar to how they use Miho as a Deus ex Machina.<br />
<br />
Story of Taichi<br />
Taichi has something resembling a story (Thank God!). His plot is that he wants to do anything to become famous and that leads him in a chase to capture Dobu. (Dobu, btw just walks around city normally like he is not being followed by bunch of cops and the entire internet). So Taichi gets popular and his personality changes in a day from a nice meaning man to “I’m better than everyone else because I am successful.” So far so good, that’s a common trope, basically the Social Network formula. So predictably, he gets into trouble, decides to stop being that way. It is probably the only plot in the entire show that is actually brought to an end. And it shows up barely and is very cliché. So I can’t commend the creators on that. That should be expected for all of the show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 5/10<br />
At least you can make fun of it together with friends. That’s what I did. Me and my friends watched every episode on release, just to make fun of it and expand our own made up theories. <br />
<br />
Overall 2/10<br />
Overall it is a really bad anime with not a lot to show for. The plot is a mess of different sub plots and awful character writing. Watch it with your friends to get a laugh. On your own it’s just boring.

<br />
Odd Taxi is so raw, authentic and powerful. It&#039;s simple and yet complicated. The characters got connected through a subtle and yet shocking events. It gives me goosebumps how the story flows flawlessly. Even the small details could give so much information. I feel like if I blink while watching this, I might miss something. Truly, A MASTERPIECE!<br />
<br />
The opening and ending song, the Seiyuus.. I think everything is perfect as it is.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t wait for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396529">
        next episode!<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. I&#039;m usually too lazy to write a review, but this show made me to write one. That&#039;s how powerful Odd Taxi is 😎

    The whole anime community should now rejoice and plunge in the sea of pleasure and gratification considering the long-awaited and looked-for modern magnum opus of the entire anime industry has finally been brought out from the brilliant mind of the potentially next Satoshi Kon, Kazuya Konomoto, and painstakingly produce it at such utmost dedication—from the aptly cartoonish style of art and animation by which complements the utilization of anthropomorphism to strive for giving a truthful real life depiction in a cutesy way, the copybook voice acting performances that accurately express the persona&#039;s countenance, and especially noting the extant actual tweets from the characters circulating the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405278">
        internet, the canonical weekly podcast series, and extras outside of the show so as to provide additional details to polish up the enthralling obscurity enveloping the whole setting— to give a much remarkable existence to this gripping mystery show that would undoubtedly be carved in the entire history of anime as one if not the most well-thought-out shows to ever exist. Akin to a notorious film noir, Odd Taxi flawlessly handled the entanglement and amalgamation of these deep and rare set of features for an anime: dementia, crime, mystery, cynicism, heavy plot — you name it, and Odd Taxi impeccably mastered it.<br />
<br />
This show here is a classic in the making. The new decade may have only just begun, but the new king has already been crowned.

    Let me get something straight: YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS SHOW. <br />
If you are not watching Odd Taxi, you simply MUST watch it, despite all the things that may turn you off such as talking animals, no-name studio and &#039;weird art style&#039;, if you love a good story, you won&#039;t be let down. <br />
<br />
Have you ever heard of Chehkov&#039;s gun?<br />
<br />
copied from Wikipedia : [a dramatic principle that states that every element in a story must be necessary, and irrelevant elements should be removed. ]<br />
<br />
<br />
As the story progresses, we learn how everything mentioned is related in unexpected ways.<br />
<br />
<br />
Writing and execution of the story is excellent, characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398968">
        are well thought out and behave and talk in realistic way,  coherent and unique to their character, which is not something I&#039;ve seen being executed this well recently. <br />
<br />
Art and sound are pretty solid, character designs are amazing and they blend outstandingly well with the story which contributes to its uniqueness and help covey personality of characters. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s extremely enjoyable and the vibe it gives of reminded me of something that could have been taken out of noir film. <br />
<br />
Overall, Odd Taxi is show bursting with originality  and character,it will keep you in the edge and  you coming back for more<br />
10/10 MUST WATCH<br />

    When I saw all of the overwhelming praise that Odd Taxi got, as well as its premise and character designs, I got a great sense of excitement and anticipation. I&#039;m very critical of the sameyness and uninteresting generic nature that most modern shows seem to have, and Odd Taxi&#039;s vibe seemed so offbeat and interesting that I was excited to give it a watch, ready to be blown away by great stories, awesome charming characters, and all sorts of unique exceptional aspects for this well-regarded sleeper hit.<br />
<br />
As I watched Odd Taxi however, I felt a familiar tightness in my chest. My brow went furrowed, my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407770">
        hands got clammy, and my face turned to one of concern rather than interest. This feeling of disappointment, and this feeling of missing something was overwhelming, but rather than mull over these feelings and just let them fester, I&#039;m letting them out here because I feel my perspective on this show could be a unique one, so please keep reading if this interests you.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m just an asshole, or some fool who missed how good this show truly is, but Odd Taxi just didn&#039;t deliver.<br />
<br />
Odd Taxi consists of our Walrus main character Odokawa interacting and getting caught up with multiple strangers and acquaintances that put him in different circumstances, only for all of these separate stories to come together in interesting ways and forcing Odokawa to try and fix everything so everyone comes out of it okay. In trying to understand what was the standout and exceptional aspect of this show, I read multiple reviews, and most seem to cite the sheer number of interesting plots and how they&#039;re woven in with each other as an aspect of this show that is truly masterful, but I&#039;m not sure if I agree. There certainly are a lot of stories going on here, but not all are equally interesting or developed as would be ideal in my eyes. Kakihana&#039;s story is one of a hopeless romantic getting involved with a girl who turns out to be into him for the wrong reasons, but there isn&#039;t a lot of interesting interplay between him and the girl for the twist to feel like a neat subversion. There&#039;s a big blue hippo fella who is obsessed with online popularity and makes it his goal to go viral, eventually getting people to rally behind him in his efforts to find and apprehend a dangerous criminal, but the way his story is developed doesn&#039;t feel super natural - we don&#039;t see why he&#039;s taken such an interest in Dobu, we don&#039;t see the depths of just how much he needs or wants online popularity enough to be effective, and we don&#039;t follow his story consistently enough for it to always be in the back of the viewer&#039;s head. There&#039;s a story of two comedians who start out as radio show comedians and slowly drift apart as one gets more high-profile opportunities, but again these two and their chemistry isn&#039;t great. They only ever act abrasive towards one another, and it isn&#039;t clear why either of them need the other one to do comedy, or even why either of them like each other enough to want to do comedy together in the first place. One of the more interesting ones is definitely with Odokawa, seeing this hapless misanthrope who can&#039;t help but get involved and do the right thing try and balance everything going on is pretty interesting, but you&#039;d think he&#039;d show some kind of exhaustion or something to illustrate the toll that all this responsibility is taking on him, but there is very little of that, and it&#039;s pretty nuts that such a socially distant individual is able to get on everybody&#039;s good side with such ease. The fact that all these storylines are being told parallel to one another in any capacity is impressive, and the way they come together is neat, but at some point Odd Taxi cared more about making the stories line up and end rather than the emotional content of each of the stories. There are very few poignant, emotionally resonant moments throughout this story, instead choosing to put most of its dialogue into exposition and elaboration between characters reiterating what is already happening, and as a result this show was a very dull watch. No jaws dropped, no smiles, no frowns, but a generally apathetic viewing experience that left me empty and unsatisfied.   <br />
<br />
The writing of Odd Taxi has also been praised as Tarantino-esque, with personality and flair indicative of each character&#039;s personalities, but the voice actors here aren&#039;t exactly churning out top-tier performances and never blindsided me with a particularly exceptional line delivery. Comparing Odd Taxi to anything Scorsese or Tarantino though is ultimately a fruitless and shallow venture, since stacking Odd Taxi up against some of the greatest cinema ever made simply isn&#039;t a fair comparison, as Odd Taxi doesn&#039;t have the directorial expertise as either of the guys I&#039;ve stated above, nor the fantastically varied writing that their best works have either. Plus, an anime such as this should be showing more than it&#039;s telling, and as is typical with plot-heavy anime, there is a whole heaping helping of exposition and elaboration here, which is never delivered with any unique characterful style. A vast majority of these lines, along with the way they&#039;re delivered, feel interchangeable between characters, and since there isn&#039;t much in the way of outstanding visual storytelling here, Odd Taxi&#039;s story and sequence of events is not nearly as engaging to follow as I was expecting.<br />
<br />
Technical aspects here are also very dull and not very noteworthy. The setting and character design is above average here, with very realized and detailed areas and very evocative character designs, but not much in the way of great facial animation or emoting. Shots are framed very rudimentarily, and there is little in the way of compelling direction to get some interesting ebbs and flows in how scenes play out. The soundtrack here has its moments too, and some nice sound design bits as well, but they are very few and very far between and just aren&#039;t much to write home about.  <br />
<br />
All of this and a bit more piled on top of each other, episode after episode failed to amaze, and I&#039;ve come to my conclusion that Odd Taxi didn&#039;t click, and it&#039;s kind of fucking with me since one look at the reception to this show across the internet shows overwhelming, well-worded and well thought -out positively ASCENDANT praise for this show, but all of the aspects of the show that should have mixed together to make a bona fide stunner of a 2021 anime made, for me, an above-average show with some good twists and fun moments that, while certainly a good attempt at a story of this kind, ultimately fell short of the mark, and I couldn&#039;t help but feel that familiar sense of disappointment and discontent writing every word of this review.  <br />
<br />
I think on paper, there&#039;s a recipe for your quintessential sleeper hit masterpiece here: Unique character designs, a cool title, flew under the radar, has an interesting plot and story in comparison to what&#039;s usually offered, a great twist ending that recontextualizes the series, but in my eyes, after fully taking in all of what Odd Taxi had to offer, tackling the show on its own terms and assessing its quality based on my own taste and standards, I&#039;m still at the same conclusion - disappointment. <br />
<br />
If I&#039;m a complete fool and have got it all wrong, feel free to leave a comment letting me know your thoughts, I&#039;d love to have some dialogues surrounding this show, especially given how disillusioned I feel with the general consensus. Thanks a bunch for reading this far.

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
Odokawa. Keep that name, because he is a great protagonist in Odd Taxi. No... Not protagonist... The essence, richness, and great acting of this show, which combines cool scenes, subdued yet gripping drama, and an exquisite realization of its mysteries. <br />
<br />
Odd Taxi is restless and at the same time it is maddening. Odokawa is the character who indirectly commands all the actions. In this world, everyone is personified with animal-like representations, which brings the show closer to social issues and the handling of instincts and sentimentality, as well as representing attitudes, temperament, physique, and above all, social function. Our protagonist is no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405485">
        different. He is a walrus, a typical robust and apathetic animal. He is a taxi driver and like a good bartender, he listens to the great stories of his customers, even if this does not involve him directly in his personal ambitions. In fact, Odokawa is detached from desires. Since an accident in the past, his life has bypassed death and he no longer has any support. Also, at the age of 12 he no longer has any guardianship and sees the world without colors, full of intermittent and unpleasant routines. Until one event occurs, in fact, several.<br />
<br />
Taichi is the first person with whom Odokawa shows his identity. He is represented by a hippopotamus. He is a man who desires internet fame and views. By irony of fate, Taichi takes a relaxed photo with Odokawa and it goes viral. The reason? Dobu. Dobu is the police&#039;s number one suspect in the disappearance of a girl in Nerima. Whether or not he is wrongly accused, Dobu has gained a reputation throughout the region as a very dangerous criminal. Nothing less could be expected... Taichi seeks to be the justice of this &quot;lawless&quot; land, with the goal of capturing Dobu. And this is how the anime proceeds. <br />
<br />
Odokawa, who previously had no importance in the plot, becomes the most relevant person in this chess. And for this, only one environment is needed, his cab. It is there that Odokawa lives his most dangerous, funny, dramatic, difficult moments, and at the same time creates friendships and relationships that interconnect all the characters. He, at the height of his 41 years, would not really be a popular man if it were not for this coincidence. But even if this were not the case, Odokawa would be the protagonist of the show.<br />
<br />
Shirakawa is the character who builds a bond the most during the show. Even before the show began, she already had financial problems. Part of this comes from Dobu. They were ex-boyfriends and Shirakawa needed a large amount of money in the past. After a long time, she finds herself in despair and planned to sell drugs from a doctor&#039;s office clandestinely. This ended the reputation of Goriki, the doctor at the place. Shirakawa then lives a life away from nursing and accomplishes things with Odokawa that surpasses her obligation. Dobu, during some conversations with Shirakawa, asked her to get involved with Odokawa and to get closer to him, as he was one of the key pieces about the missing girl&#039;s case. As much as she finds herself in that obligation, she has formed greater bonds with Odokawa. At the same time, Odokawa was already too involved with Shirakawa. No matter how Odokawa tried to keep from trapping those feelings, he was already consumed by a small crush on Shirakawa. Even without talking to Kakihana, one of his only friends, Odokawa had previously told him that his passion was growing. Before it was an inexplicable feeling, perhaps because it was a feeling never felt before. In fact, when one is in love, reason no longer exists. Odokawa finds himself involved in Shirakawa&#039;s problems and wants to help her in some way. Going for the solution, he and Dobu team up to solve their problems, even though Dobu initially threatens him with an Odokawa gun over the memory card of Odokawa&#039;s car recordings.<br />
And it is from this moment on that things start to get more and more interesting in Odd Taxi. Even with Odokawa being a simple worker, he was not just a submissive character who complied with people&#039;s requests, he had to act. And in addition to acting to resolve his conflicts, his own mental problems were highlighted. Goriki, the doctor and his friend, can trace an answer to things that Odokawa identifies with ease. The very way he converses, discovers people&#039;s professions, and identifies his friend easily in a crowd makes Odokawa have some specialty. This very specialty puts him in check with his past. Even though he does not assume it, his parents are dead at the fateful moment when he was 12 years old. In addition, his life was troubled even before that day. His mother was an alcoholic and his father was cheating on her. Odokawa resigned himself mentally and as a form of security, he developed visual agnosia. This disease causes Odokawa to see people in the form of animals. <br />
<br />
With this and all the obstacles in his life, Odokawa works with Dobu, while wanting justice, after all, both he and Yano and their henchmen. Shirakawa is a precious person to Odokawa, even though he is not good at communicating with women. After Kakihana is rescued, it was normal to think that the show would have nothing to show our eyes. But the show reminds us that it has a big conflict ahead of it. Remember the missing girl in the confines of the show? Then the second half of the show is devoted to the conclusions of the protagonist, Dobu, Yano&#039;s group, and Odokawa&#039;s friends, who are somehow joined in this event by interpersonal connections. Mystery Kiss, the group of idols, is revealed to be a group that has an extortion scheme under the covers, so much so that it was because of one of the girls by whom Kakihana was duped.<br />
<br />
The show does not amplify the overall context of Yano&#039;s intentions and his rivalry with Dobu beyond what is necessary. They get money for the Boss and their conflict is sustained on that financial issue. Dobu wants to frame Yano in a subtle way, supported by Odokawa. The two plan with Imai, winner of the giant lottery prize, an attempt to trap Yano and his group, with the aim of framing them. Thinking from this side, the anime and the situations leading up to the final events did not use gimmicks from the past (Like Kakihana&#039;s case) to effect everyone&#039;s fate. On the contrary, the conclusion of the show is properly consolidated within this exciting event. Odokawa, nevertheless, does not hesitate to solve his own disagreements and besides managing to end up with Yano&#039;s group (besides Daimon, the oldest), Dobu was the protagonist of a sad ending and at the same time one of those who got a fair ending for his actions. His interconnections with the young man carrying his weapon was an incredible moment within the penultimate episode. In truth, the anime absorbed a troubled perspective of a boy addicted to a simple game, but one that eroded his mind in a discomfiting way. The addiction, the family stress, the burnout at work, and all his mental escapes were intrinsically condensed into a character that had no obvious relationships with any other character in the show. Ultimately, fate arranged an ending where Dobu had miscalculated the amount of bullets his gun had and was shot... Daimon (the younger brother) was instrumental in accomplishing this feat, totally planned by Odokawa.<br />
<br />
About the conclusion, the puzzle closes in an impressive way. Odokawa has her past remembered, while the rest of the characters have a specific conclusion, even if with a bit of insecurity. Sakura, one of the 3 idols of Mystery Kiss, is shown as being responsible for the death of her predecessor Mitsuya, for the sake of rewarding her mother, who cared so much for Sakura. The show&#039;s only free criminal is one of the important things that can upset. It is understandable that she was cautious and intelligent, so much so that suspicions were placed on Nikaido, unfairly. Fortunately, the show was realistic and while showing Odokawa&#039;s improvement, it shows everyday factors that still need to be resolved in the world of Odd Taxi. It is a matter of subjective acceptance, many like the show to be organic, others prefer a total conclusion. In Odd Taxi, what matters is not in fact this partially disappointing ending, but the entire adventure we had during the thirteen episodes. <br />
<br />
Baku Kinoshita&#039;s production and work are impressive. It was scary to see that in his debut as an anime creator he was an amazing writer and director. Punpee also needs to be applauded. Those responsible for Opening made a music video to the music from Odd Taxi and it only intensified Odokawa&#039;s perspective on people. A world filled with mysteries, adventures, and... animals. No, instincts, quirks, and a great way to build a show that deserves to be remembered for years to come. <br />
<br />
I am impressed with the quality of April&#039;s animes, but Odd Taxi is the most beautiful conclusion we could have. There will never be another show like it. It is an artistic uniqueness, a manifestation of what it is to be creative and have a care for what you build. Congratulations. Odd Taxi, you are a unique show!!!

    Hol up<br />
<br />
Hol TF up<br />
<br />
I&#039;mma drop the unpopular opinion right here, but I feel like I need to add a bit of balance. You know I wouldn&#039;t lie to you, ya&#039;ll too cute for that.<br />
<br />
Ya&#039;ll. If Odd Taxi is a masterpiece as anitwit keeps claiming, then we REALLY need to take a hard look at our surrounding anime titles of this day and age. If this SHINES then we need to accept that everything else must be incredible DULL. <br />
<br />
Odd Taxi? More like PLOT CONVENIENCE the anime, starring ANIMALS. I&#039;d like to say it&#039;s original, but with the rise of BStars, BNA, Zootopia and whatever that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407756">
        MLP thing is, this anthropomorphic character choice isn&#039;t even that unique anymore.<br />
<br />
Story? If you like dull, drab, uninteresting monotone dialogue, you&#039;ll love this anime. If you can&#039;t fit the square peg into the square socket you&#039;ll LOVE the &quot;mystery&quot; of this anime! Ya&#039;ll really out here making excuses for that that the GIANT GAPING GOATSE of a plot convenience in the penultimate episode? Why doesn&#039;t Edward Elric just find a philosopher stone in his back pocket? Why doesn&#039;t Gon just walk around the block and find Ging? Why? BECAUSE STORY MATTERS. UNLESS I&#039;M WATCHING ODD TAXI. <br />
<br />
Art? It&#039;s fine? It&#039;s certainly animated. The animation isn&#039;t the issue.<br />
<br />
Sound? Soundtrack? What&#039;s that? <br />
<br />
Characters - Again, dull, uninteresting. Bruh. An alpaca that can do capoeira, wowow. A hippo and a....squirrel?.....A rat? I dunno wtf he is, but they are both addicted to social media. A monkey that uses his dreams and lackluster life to justify his incel nature and lies to get laid by a cat idol? Wow. R I V E T I N G. Like a character? I hope not, because they don&#039;t go anywhere. They serve their singular purpose and are forgotten just as quickly. <br />
<br />
But hol up. It ain&#039;t all bad. YANO is the MVP of this anime. Unique, wild af, and worth watching. I know ya&#039;ll culture out here, you&#039;ll appreciate Yano. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall? Na mate. This ain&#039;t it. This isn&#039;t anime of the year, this isn&#039;t a masterpiece, and it&#039;s not a Tarantino flick. Anitwit and YTanime is out here salivating over this title, and it&#039;s fine. Check it out. Or don&#039;t. I don&#039;t know your life. But temper your expectations because it&#039;s not that groundbreaking. It&#039;s fine. That&#039;s about it.<br />
<br />
TLDR- A strong conclusion does NOT make this anime a masterpiece. It just doesn&#039;t. And no, it&#039;s not a got dang Tarantino film just because multiple stories come together in the end. Stop it. <br />

    This show is an underrated gem and it is tragic how under-appreciated it is due to the slew of other great anime airing this season. This is by far one of the best written anime I have ever had the pleasure of watching, only rivalled by, in my opinion, Steins;Gate. Starting off seemingly as a slice-of-life show starring an eccentric taxi driver, it slowly reveals itself as a crime, psychological thriller mystery with so much detail and nuance packed in its truly astounding. The amount of theorising and discussion around the show at this point is amazing and the fact that so many people picked

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401118">
        up on small details that completely went over my head makes me appreciate the show even more. It&#039;s a mystery so carefully planned out, I know it&#039;ll be incredibly satisfying and cathartic once we get the payoff to all these unanswered questions. This show about animals, a taxi driver and a missing girl is not what it seems and I&#039;d highly recommend watching this just for the writing alone! 10/10 love this show, its story, its characters and its OP, what a beautiful song that is one of three anime songs I&#039;ve added to my spotify playlist! Don&#039;t sleep on this show!

    (TLDR at the bottom, thanks for reading.)<br />
<br />
Odd taxi is good.<br />
<br />
TLDR: Anime of the season.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is this issue I have with anime, especially dialogue-heavy light novel adaptations, where the dialogue feels like it was written by a robot. Very by the book statements that don&#039;t really feel like they were made by humans and were made by a computer program, at best the writers might try to add some personality to by having the characters insult each other and then pass it off as sarcasm. So when the first episode of odd taxi started with two radio comedians having an organic conversation it immediately hooked me

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405224">
        because this isn&#039;t something you see in anime. In a show like odd taxi this authentically human dialogue is extremely important, not because of its plot but because of its characters.<br />
<br />
When you think of well-writen anime characters you might this of characters that develop and change but most characters in odd taxi are adults who have already grown because this anime isn&#039;t about people growing and changing, it&#039;s about society and the connections people make and in this massive web of connections Odakawa is in the centre of all of it.<br />
This is why a place such a big importance on dialogue because odd taxi leans entirely on its characters, it&#039;s a show that relies completely on its characters. The actual plot of the show isn&#039;t anything to write home about, a heist with some corrupt cops and a missing high schooler, all pretty standard stuff but since it has such strong character writing it can get away with it.<br />
When people are talking about plot in anime they often just talk about the events in the plot of the characters and how they develop, but one thing that often isn&#039;t discussed is structure. Most anime approach their story in a fairly linear fashion, event A happens then event B then C you get the idea, but not odd taxi. Odd taxi&#039;s story happens by a group of random characters living their life and one small event leads to another which leads another, which leads to another. The story then unfolds in an organic, and realistic, way. One of the main benefits of this chaos theory like structure is that it constantly keeps you on your toes, it is kind of easy to predict if you know anything about general storytelling tropes, but the main trope odd taxi applies is an absolute rejection of traditional writing styles and trope and therefor it constantly keeps you on your toes.<br />
<br />
All these little things build up, the lofi music, Odakawa&#039;s dry yet eccentric behaviour, the visual aesthetic, the structure, the dialogue everything comes together to make one unique whole. While each of these individual parts may not make a show good on their own the way the coalesce forms a truly unique whole. <br />
<br />
At this point saying anything more won&#039;t add much to the review, the visuals are constant on-model and memorable, the music is chill, the delivery of the plot and dialogue is good and you get the general idea of things.<br />
<br />
TLDR: Odd taxi is good

    TL:DR Hidden Gem. If you enjoy genius dialogue you&#039;ll enjoy Odd Taxi.<br />
<br />
The story feels very refreshing and it includes modern problems and concepts which are refreshing in itself.<br />
<br />
The art also feels fairly wholesome even though its simplicity. I just like it, it accompanies the feel of relaxing the show has. <br />
<br />
I also really like as good as every character presented here especially the way the author writes them into the story.<br />
<br />
The sound is used appropriately and especially considering when the dialogue is more important, there aren&#039;t any BGM! Also the OP is a banger for sure.<br />
 <br />
If I compare it to the other 300 Anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396025">
        I watched, this is one of the Anime that I enjoyed the most.<br />
<br />
Overall, I would give this a 10 out of 10.

    Are you looking at the reviews wondering if you should watch this anime? Just take my word for it, you should watch it.<br />
<br />
If you are wondering why it is worth a watch, perhaps my opinion will help you out.<br />
<br />
I am not an experienced reviewer by any means, but I have seen a respectable amount of anime over the years (which my page does not reflect, as I am not active on this site) and through watching these series I have picked up on a few things that make a show good.<br />
<br />
One of the things that I look for in an anime is some form of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405424">
        respect for the viewer&#039;s time. One example of the opposite is the current My Hero Academia season, which (according to a manga reader) has been covering one chapter of the manga per episode, which made these episodes have a snail&#039;s pace and overly forced exposition. On the other hand, Odd Taxi is a show that does not treat the viewer like a young child incapable of thought. If watching HeroAca makes me feel like my intelligence is being insulted, Odd Taxi forces me to pay attention or I will inevitably miss some things. I would definitely argue that your enjoyment of this series heavily depends on how attentive you are willing to be while watching. If you are like me and you are sometimes afraid of reading too much into details only to be utterly disappointed in the end, you are in luck. While you certainly do not have to be a genius to follow the plot of Odd Taxi, paying attention to the details and figuring the twists out before they happen is, in my opinion, still extremely rewarding. Each character in the story ties neatly into the entirety of the plot and most if not all of the loose ends are taken care of by the end.<br />
<br />
Something I would like to briefly mention is the animation in this show. While it is certainly not the best in the industry, one must keep in mind that this anime is not a battle shounen. If you want to see incredible action sequences, you are definitely not watching Odd Taxi for that. I will give the series a 10/10 despite the production not being perfect, because that is not what defines an anime like Odd Taxi.<br />
<br />
P.S. There is a side story that occurs at the same time as the anime on the official youtube channel of Odd Taxi. The series of videos is in Japanese, but maybe one day there will be subtitles or some youtuber will cover it. Basically, there is a pen with a recording device in it that goes from one character&#039;s hand to another and the rest you will have to find out for yourself.<br />

    This is an incredibly well done show, the number of animes of this caliber are less than the number of fingers on a hand.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this anime will appear boring at face value and will turn almost every typical anime watcher away due to the lack of surface appeal.<br />
<br />
To say this anime is a slice of life does not do it justice. That just gives the presumption that its simply revolves around people with no plot enjoying life.<br />
<br />
The level of writing in this anime is not like most animes, in fact it barely follows a story structure of traditional story telling. Its more to kin of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395089">
        verbal short films in the west or the storytelling dialogue style of Quentin Tarantino films. Most animes follow with: your exposition, your expository background on the main character, some heavy information drop in a fictional world, and then an action scene or 2.<br />
<br />
i only need to be 2 episodes in and i could see how this anime might be structured:<br />
there is currently no visible plot, however there is a LOT of well placed set up. Most of this anime is done and told in dialogue. and its barely even world building dialogue because it takes place in the real modern world with no fictional element to it (other than everyone being animals).<br />
<br />
All story is told with the character interactions, especially with the taxi driver and his passengers. you learn about each of the reoccurring characters in a grounded way, stuff is implied and the audience is left to piece things together. The dialogue is smart, grounded, and easily believable across every character. Every character is relatable and each with their own problems and relations with each one. Everyone has some hidden secret and its never outright told, leaving you to find out.<br />
<br />
To describe this as best i can:<br />
Imagine Durarara, but without the chaos of it, with the mature content and character design of Aggretsuko, and the dialogue style of Tarantino

    weebs you better chill. this is hardly something groundbreaking or genial as you&#039;d think. it has a namedrop ffs.<br />
<br />
overall the narrative is competent, but it doesn&#039;t have anything meaningful to say besides being a character exploration thriller/mystery/crime episodic experience. all characters (even odokawa somehow) are one-dimensional and do not grow or change throughout the first season. every single character stays the same from beginning to end. the whole situation is so fabricated that it feels completely inorganic and confusing to some extent. the entire kakihana arch is borderline unwatchable because it feels out-of-place and so unredeemable that i honestly would see benefits to the narrative

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409825">
        in killing the character.<br />
<br />
visually-wise, the characters being anthropomorphic animals did help a lot in contextualizing the plot but i have no idea why they thought it&#039;d be a good idea to explain it in the last episode. it serves as a plot twist moment but it has literally no weight to the narrative (and the human characters look pretty bad). and oh boi the whole mystery behind doors in odokawa&#039;s place was one of the dumbest things i&#039;ve seen in anime in years.<br />
<br />
the first few episodes were interesting and i could see some of the praise in its novelty and plot, but similarly to wonder egg, it devolves so much the more you watch it (gladly not as bad as wonder egg). a decent &#039;meh&#039; in my opinion, i don&#039;t really see the point in watching a second season, especially if the characters are now human.

    I hope I don&#039;t say anything too silly, this is my first time reviewing a series and I&#039;m also stupid, please bear with me.<br />
<br />
Characters;<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll get to the point, This anime may have one of the best characterizations I&#039;ve ever seen, the characters feel genuine and their actions no matter how small, constantly have an impact on the overall story while also managing to be grounded in reality. IT ALL MAKES SENSE, and it&#039;s so satisfying to see it all come together. The dialogue is fantastic too, it feels like they&#039;re actually talking instead of trying to shoehorn stuff to try and accelerate the plot.<br />
<br />
If it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406130">
        not clear by now, CHARACTERS ARE A 10/10.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story; 10/10<br />
<br />
<br />
The story gives you just enough information about Odokawa&#039;s past to keep you invested until the amazing payoff at the end. I really can&#039;t say much about Odokawa because I want you to go completely blind into the anime, I want you to find out about all the twists and turns because It&#039;s all subtly hinted at from the start. <br />
<br />
About the others, they&#039;re just as well-written with their backstories encompassing Lots of different themes. This story is so cohesive that I don&#039;t know what the story would be like if even the most minor characters didn&#039;t exist.<br />
<br />
I also wanna mention that theorizing about Odokawa&#039;s story and what the hell is going on was very fun for me, each episode changed my theory bit by bit and it was a delight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound; 9/10<br />
<br />
The OST is amazing and fits the story, as usual. I can&#039;t stop praising this anime. The opening song is probably the second-best after Houseki no Kuni which is saying a lot. It&#039;s so relaxing and sounds good too. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art; 9/10<br />
<br />
 The character designs are very good, you can almost guess what their personalities are just by looking at them. Well-defined silhouettes, colorful and saturated color palettes which are in nice contrast to the darker themes this story presents, and everything is very consistently animated.<br />
<br />
<br />
10/10 series, just watch it, bro.
