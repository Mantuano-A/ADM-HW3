One common misconception among the anime community is that sales and profit are proportional to an anime’s quality. Is a film that sells millions of tickets objectively better than one that sells fewer tickets? Demon Slayer: Mugen Train’s record-breaking box office performance may lead you to believe it is one of the greatest films ever made, but the truth is... the writing is no better than the anime.<br />
<br />
Three-quarters of the two-hour-long film takes place on the titular Mugen Train, a brave choice for one of the least interesting settings the series has to offer. Each train car is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395266">
        similar; historically accurate wooden interiors, passengers conveniently sleeping while the bloody and stunningly animated fights rage on in the center aisles. While it does not quite deserve the R+ rating, the detailed animation and fight choreography will surely impress even the most cynical viewer. Aside from the hideous CGI creatures and tentacles, it is visually excellent. <br />
<br />
Unlike prior horrific villains in Demon Slayer, our central antagonist is solely motivated by sadism. He desires to send the demon slayers into pleasant dreams just before killing them. There’s no real reason for these reality-altering powers within the narrative; it’s transparently a plot device made to give us character development and insight into Tanjiro and our new supporting character, Rengoku Kyoujurou: a compassionate high-ranking Demon Hunter with firey-hair and forked eyebrows. Once again, our villain pointlessly explains his motivations and powers unprompted. Script troubles like this aren’t simply a side effect of being a manga adaptation—it’s poor writing. They could introduce clues at the start and later reveal the twist once we understand how the demon powers work: The writer could do this through context clues rather than overly literal dialogue.  <br />
<br />
The antagonist, an androgynous demon, sends Tanjiro and friends into a deep slumber. In the meantime, he guides his minions to invade the demon hunters’ dreams, similar to a sci-fi flick like Inception. These dream sequences take up most of the first third of the film, with flashbacks scattered throughout the runtime. <br />
<br />
(Minor spoilers below)<br />
<br />
In Tanjiro’s dream, we return to his home in the snowy forest, seen at the beginning of the TV series. His family is alive and well. For the first time, we get to see their interactions. Seeing them reunited is emotional, but it quickly set in that it was all a dream, and thus none of it mattered. The purpose of his dream sequence is for him to reconcile with a past I didn’t care about because it has never been relevant or exciting. Their unceremonious death in the first episode indicated how much I should care about them and their 1-dimensional characters. Once again, his family’s gory murder is used to make us sympathize with Tanjiro. Through his flashbacks, there was a significant chance to develop Tanjiro before leaving home: Showcasing his relationship with one or two siblings, or even his mother, would’ve added layers to him. Instead, the film blends all of his many family members together with a couple of boiler-plate personality traits like “Happy” and “Concerned” for Tanjiro. <br />
<br />
(Spoilers complete)<br />
<br />
The demon-induced dreams were adequately explained and logically coherent at first. Then they added new aspects such as “Destroying the subconscious” and “Incarnations of the soul.” These concepts are more suited to a film like Inception or Tenet than a Taisho-era demon-hunting plot.<br />
<br />
Zenitsu and Inosuke’s dreams are fluff filler more suited to a non-canonical OVA or a fan-fiction. If you were annoyed by their loud voices and obnoxious personalities, this film will not change your mind. Most of their dialogue is delivered in screams, like in the anime. Yelling still isn’t a joke, nor is it funny. At least their scenes are few, and they’re reserved for sudden appearances to support Tanjiro in battles. On the other hand, Nezuko was almost entirely irrelevant. Unfortunately, she does not get a dream sequence—which would’ve provided much-needed character development. At least she’s not stuck in a box for the whole time. <br />
<br />
Rengoku’s dream is perhaps the only one of interest because it develops his backstory and motivations. There’s a clear emotional connection between him, his anguished father, and his plucky younger brother. Seeing him inspire his little brother with pep talks and training made him all the more likable. Even though the dialogue was your average lines like “Do your best,” it was effective. He was genuinely my favorite character thus far. I would say his scenes, while simplistically written, made up for Tanjiro’s tedious dream sequence. Unlike Tanjiro, Rengoku’s flashbacks zeroed in on his relationships with individuals, like his mother, rather than grouping them all together. With this minimal background information, the emotionally charged climactic battle earns its spectacular pay-off. <br />
<br />
The third quarter flies off the rails and contains the film’s best fight scene. You can easily sit back and enjoy the top-of-the-line animation quality for this part since it boils down to a battle between good versus evil. After twenty minutes of appreciating Ufotable’s magnificent artistry and LiSA’s emotional insert song, the climax lasts much too long. The hero’s foe, another seemingly invincible demon, gives his big bad speech multiple times before the battle finally ends. They aimed for an emotional gut-punch, and it would’ve worked had the film concluded 30 minutes sooner. Unfortunately for us, the final fight ends on a disappointingly inconclusive note. In an attempt to stick the landing, Tanjiro lets out a long blood-curdling scream which I can only describe as obnoxiously unnecessary. His voice actor Natsuki Hanae put his heart into the performance, and his passion for the character shines through—despite the lackluster script. I watched both the Japanese version and English dub, and they’re well-acted. The English version casts each character appropriately.<br />
<br />
The overlong and incomplete ending can likely be attributed to the manga chapter ending on a cliffhanger. The material was stretched thin already, with no time to tackle the rest. Until the second season arrives, we’re left with a hollow sensation that serves as a reminder: This must convince us to watch the sequel. Demon Slayer: Mugen Train is an amazingly successful product, and no criticism I levy at it will change this fact. Worldwide it has made hundreds of millions of dollars and broken box-office records. That’s a landmark worth praising the film for. <br />
<br />
The question is, does profit decide if a film is good or not? That&#039;s for you to decide.

    I was super lucky to be able to see this in theaters the day this came out! <br />
<br />
Story: 6/10 The story is a continuation of the Demon Slayer Anime that ended last year in 2019, being an adaptation of the Mugen Train Arc. You may recognize the main villain or demon of this arc from the first season, well you did see him. He was the the demon who Muzan had given his blood to, the one who wanted to be tortured. It closely follows the Manga&#039;s events, showing off Rengoku using his Sun Breathing Techniques, and all the fights. It feels bloated with fights

          <span style="display: none;" id="review360315">
        and not much else, but that&#039;s mostly the manga&#039;s fault. The movie does play out the emotional scenes quite well. Kimetsu no Yaiba was never big on the story aspect so it will be expected for the movie and any adaptations if they want to stick to the source material. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10: Once again, Studio Ufotable has knocked it out of the park with the breathtaking animation they have. But this time around it&#039;s even better with a movie budget. Its so smooth and satisfying that it just draws you in like that. The breathing techniques were the highlight of the First Season, and its the same for here. I have no idea how Studio Ufotable does it. With Tanjirou&#039;s breathing, the almost 3d looking camera angles, the fast paced movements, Nezuko&#039;s Exploding blood, Zenitsu&#039;s lighting, Inouske in all of his glory, its absolutely fantastic.<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10: Another amazingly great aspect. At times like that, I love being in a Japanese theater, because everybody is very silent, doesn&#039;t laugh at jokes or gasps, its a great expierence. The sound effects are pretty good, with the Voice acting being taken to the next level. But the real highlight in terms of the sound, is the amazing Musical Score. I said it once and I will say it again, Demon Slayer has one of the best orchestrated soundtracks in an Anime that I have ever seen. The low and melancholy piano keys, the tense and sharp violin, the soft and relaxing flute, the haunting chorus, it all comes together to make a amazing score. <br />
<br />
Characters: 6/10: Nothing really changed from the first season, with most characters sticking with their personalities. But at times it just feels like the second season of the anime and not a feature length film. I mean, its an exact adaptation so you expect it to be similar to the manga but its very similar to the source material and the previous Season. The constant yelling between the trio is very annoying, like the first season. Even when writing this review, I feel like I&#039;m just reviewing the anime. The only thing that changed was the art but everything stays the same in terms of my thoughts on the anime. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10: I enjoyed the Demon Slayer Anime, but this, raised the bar even higher, I highly highly highly suggest watching this when it comes out on streaming services. Demon Slayer is shaping up to be another gigantic manga and anime series even if it might not deserve it fully. But if your a big fan of Shonen Jump or the second season, OR even the manga I would suggest watching it. But its not perfect, I think too many people have hyped up Demon Slayer, which can be bad when the ending eventually gets animated, because it will all come crashing down. But still good for the time being. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10

    Story isn&#039;t everything.<br />
<br />
This movie didn&#039;t have any major flaws, they were only little tidbits that could be found in any other anime regardless of how popular they were.<br />
<br />
The reason KnY stands out to me than other shounen is because the series doesn&#039;t feel stretched out unlike other popular shounen. The story actually flows and progresses each arc we get closer and closer to our end goal. The MC is actually really cool he may be pure and sympathetic, but he can get the job done without any sort of hesitation. Inosuke is pretty good, Zenitsu can be cool from time to time. Nezuko is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362188">
        really great little sister, she isn&#039;t like your typical little sister in anime. Everyone else has their own quirk. So really the animation and music used in this anime only acts as a bonus that puts the show at a greater level. <br />
<br />
So overall this movie was really great and highly recommendable.

    I am extremely lucky to have crazy ass friends that were able to get me ticket for this movie on the opening day. It was sold out in advance with huge waiting list and it was clearly visible by the TOHO Cinemas Roppogi Hills where I was pleased to see this movie. Every available seat was taken and queue was HUGE. <br />
<br />
Now, let&#039;s have a deeper look at the movie itself, there&#039;ll be some minor spoilers but if u haven&#039;t read the manga I strongly suggest to avoid them, they&#039;ll be marked. <br />
<br />
STORY: 7<br />
I was never a big fan of KnY, it&#039;s pretty generic and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review360332">
        predictable shounen, but it was fun and enjoyable, up to some point, overall manga was really disappointed at the end and final arcs were to say least, weak. But it does&#039;t change anything, we&#039;re talking about the movie which adapted Mugen Train Arc and did it really, really good, giving justice to the manga and leaving audiences with an quality product.<br />
Tanjirou and his friends accompany Rengoku, the Flame Hashira on the mission to investigate unexplainable disappearances onboard the train. They don&#039;t yet know, that Enmu, one of the elite Twelve Kizuki demons is awaiting them with a trap. It&#039;s fast paced, darker and suprisingly close to the manga events, would say that the sligh changes made it even better. <br />
<br />
[SPOILER] The sad and bitter ending was really powerful, leaving us speechless and very emotional. Done right, without forced sadness and fake emotions. And for that it ufotable has my thanks. [END SPOILER]<br />
<br />
ART: 10<br />
It&#039;s ufotable after all. And with huge movie pudget it&#039;s basically one big show off of magical skills of animators. We got to see Rengoku in action, with such a detail and precision, beautifully animated and blood pumping. Tanjirou showed even more of his techiques and is was pleasable, what&#039;s most important, the framerate and overall animation quality is superb, flawless. And yeah, we got to see more of Nezuko in action. The fights choreography is another ufo usual, amazing and smooth, with beautiful colors and movements. Designs were even sharper and planning and backgrounds were bloody well done. Mixture of ultramodern animation with static drawings and CGI is top notch. Orgy for the eyes.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 10<br />
And the sound is an orgy for the ears. Voicing is powerful and reliable, full of emotions and feels. Music on the other hand is once again an beautifully written mixture of classic japanese sounds and modern orchestration and arangations. Plus of course beautiful ending by LiSA hits straight into the heart. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 6<br />
Well, character development in KnY is just fine, nothing unexpected, pretty straightforward and predictable. But it is done right and without cringe, just your regular shounen show off. From the checkpoint to another checkpoint on the road to achieve goals and plans. But what stands out is a nice Rengoku introduction, his backstory and good explanation of his motives. Job well done. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 9<br />
Ufotable never disappoints when it comes to enjoyment, it&#039;s epic, fast and looks godly. And it looks godly af. Great combination of action, music and simple, but fair story makes very good impression and leaves with heart pumping faster. Like proper action flick, enjoy the show and leave no place for deeper thinking. Pure fun and action, strongly recommend to watch it at the biggest possible screen when it&#039;ll be released for streaming and bluray next year. <br />
<br />
OVERALL: 8<br />
An very good movie, better than expected, satysfying and an visual diamond. Ain&#039;t the best action movie, but it&#039;s very much what action movie is supposed to be. Yeah, it has it&#039;s critics, I&#039;m one of em, but it doesn&#039;t stop me from enjoying an great entertainment. Especially when it&#039;s done with highest possible quality. Great as an cure for the current situation, makes u forget for nearly 2 hours about reality. I recommend it of course for every fan of KnY as well as fans of good action flicks. It stands on entertaining the audiences and with bit darker notes it delivers as well bit deeper view and can make u emotional. An satysfying and ectremely well done movie. Even with it&#039;s typical shounen flaws and shorts. An job well done ufotable, thanx again.

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
real talk tho, a dope soundtrack and some slick visuals are not enough to carry mind-numbingly expository dialogue and one-note characters.<br />
<br />
the writing is more or less indefensible, the plot is generic, the humor falls flat, and the characters – again – are painfully one-note. zenitsu and inosuke are (expectedly) unlikably annoying. <br />
<br />
the soundtrack really is great, as are the demon designs – i&#039;ll give it that. <br />
<br />
also the demon literally had a three-minute death rattle wherein he recapped the film. at the end of it we were being told how strong tangerine is by

    Well... to start off: Absolute god tier animation. I might say this is the best anime movie I have yet to witness. It&#039;s a modern-age animated film that has trumped Ghibli&#039;s beautiful and subtle storytelling. Phenomenal job to ufotable and the rest of the animation-based companies that worked on this. Amazing soundtrack as well! I have no words for how many times my ears felt immersed in each scene of the IMAX theater I was in. Anywho... EVERYONE go watch it now!!!!!!!!! 10/10. Ten out of ten. Should be infinity out of ten. See what I did there? Okay I&#039;ll stop now.

    If you didn&#039;t like the anime series, won&#039;t like this either. <br />
<br />
Usually, I tend to be as objective as I can &#039;cause I can rate with a 5 or a 4 an anime and that doesn&#039;t always mean that I didn&#039;t enjoy that, it means that it&#039;s full of flaws that I can&#039;t just ignore. Nevertheless, this time my subjectivity is going to take a lot of place here, because even though its&#039;s not perfect, I love Kimetsu no Yaiba. <br />
<br />
I want to say that even if it does sound like spoilers, the things I mention throughout the review are already presented in both trailers!

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363761">
        So it is not spoiler.<br />
<br />
The premise is pretty simple and retakes, of course, the last part of the anime. Since the whole adaptation is entirely loyal to the manga, I personally regard this, more than a movie, as an arc of the anime. There is no difference with everything that has been shown before in the series, and kind of it isn&#039;t a great closure, I mean, it ends even opener than the series. The only novelty is the first apparition of an upper moon (3th kizuki), who is actually my favourite kizuki, Akaza. Going back to the adaptation thing, that is something that turns KnY down, &#039;cause the mistakes are the mangaka&#039;s, Gotouge. All the debilities it has are originally from the manga, that&#039;s why I can&#039;t adjudicate this errors to the anime or the movie. They are doing the best they can with the material they have, and that&#039;s it, and that&#039;s something I respect. It&#039;s not like other animes where the problem is the director&#039;s adaptation and pacing choices.<br />
<br />
The story then, it&#039;s fine, not complex nor big deal, yet still attractive. Of course, there are plot armors that I&#039;m not delving into right now. Pretty convenients, but I wasn&#039;t expecting another thing. It is not characterized by its master tier plots. Just a nice entertaining movie with flashy fights and some well-handled emotional moments that are very predictable; those were touching to me anyways. As I said, nothing new nor distinctive from the anime. I even dare to say that it&#039;s not as great as the anime since, by nature, KnY has many development errors (both story and characters) that in the 26 episodes can manage to slip by unseen, but in a movie, that it&#039;s a lot shorter, that&#039;s imposssible. However, it&#039;s pretty enjoyable.<br />
<br />
In terms of characters, both in manga and in movie, it still has its lacks. The first part of the fim is about a demon&#039;s blood technique that makes them fall asleep and introduces them in an infinite dream where they live in their own paradise; Tanjiro dreams of his family, Inosuke dreams of himself as a big leader, Zenitsu, of course, dreams of a girl. And Nezuko, logically, did her part as the cute relief of the movie. The purpose is to kill them in their dreamworld. As always, in flashbacks (or dreams lmao) is kind of the only way they find to construct a background or a development for a character. It works for me, but is a poor resource if it is used all the time. This is somewhat sad, because, even though a movie is not long enough to create a big depth (specially in a shounen), there could have been more character&#039;s exploration. Or at least, please, ZENITSU, STOP CRYING AND FIGHT WHILE BEING AWAKE. In resume, won&#039;t witness any character changes, at least not noticeable.<br />
<br />
Later, we have the beloved Rengoku, a character that acts as the trigger that every shounen protagonist needs. Is, in my opinion, a wasted personage that could have taken this as an opportunity to be developed, since in the series the viewer barely knows his name and his breathing technique as a hashira. His only background is, again, through flashbacks. By the very end you get to see a little bit more things about him that can tell what kind of person he is. But, to me, it wasn&#039;t enough. I appreciate him tho.<br />
<br />
I want to stop for a moment just to say how amazing Akaza is and how regrettable it is the way he is presented and disappear. His seiyuu, the dear Akira Ishida, made me explode. I couldn&#039;t expect less from him; when I knew he was voicing this demon, I screamed as the cringey fangirl I am. The other demon present in the movie, the main one, Enmu, is completely plain with no minimum exploration, and even is weak and ridiculous. It&#039;s the typical sadistic crazy character whose unique objective is to spread blood al over the place. That&#039;s a pointless villain that could have been replaced for another a lot better, given it is a film.<br />
<br />
In animation, of course, no complaints at all since it is this franchise&#039;s strongest point. This is an Ufotable top tier animation, amazing in every possible way. Character designs are a lot better than the manga&#039;s, so that&#039;s another point. Fights are excellent, exciting without a doubt, and the sound is even better. LiSa is the best thing that ever happened to KnY. The only thing I would complain is some CGI moments that are pretty mediocre. However, from a technical point of view, this is a masterpiece. Shamefully, that&#039;s a great part of KnY&#039;s success, and that&#039;s not enough to cover its debilities. Thank god this was made by Ufotable, otherwise this would have been another unnoticed anime.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, as a shounen movie that covers just one arc of a fairly long story, is very decent and enjoyable, and for the anime fans or manga readers, this is orgasmic. I myself enjoyed this a big time, because despite all the holes and lacks it has, this story won my heart and the characters did as well. I&#039;m aware of the loosen details, but that didn&#039;t detract me at all from my feelings. A story doesn&#039;t need to be a 10 for it to take root in me. That&#039;s what Kimetsu no Yaiba is.<br />
<br />
Again, if you didn&#039;t like the main story or you couldn&#039;t stand the errors and weakness in the series, do not watch this, because if you have expectations for this to change anything, it won&#039;t. It can be just as amazing as the first part, or just as lame as the first part. It depends totally on your previous experience.<br />

    There might be spoilers, <br />
<br />
Being a Manga Reader I already knew what was coming and yet the movie still had me surprised at some scenes simply because of how amazingly adapted it was. <br />
<br />
To be fair, this could have just been an add-on for the next season of Demon Slayer but I understand the need to generate hype within the narrative. AS IF IT WASN&#039;T ALREADY POPULAR ENOUGH, this movie just helped to drive the message home that Kimetsu No Yaiba is anime of the decade, period. The release was an instant success nationwide in Japan and had insane hype for a worldwide release. Needless

          <span style="display: none;" id="review364367">
        to say, the experience is far from disappointing because it stayed true to the intended narrative whilst including bonus complementary scenes that are not in the &quot;MANGA&quot; so even if you&#039;re a true manga fan you&#039;re still in for a treat. <br />
<br />
One of the main reasons that helped Demon Slayer succeed was its compelling narrative alongside characters that had the audience rooting for them unconditionally. Oh and let&#039;s not forget the gorgeous artwork and animations invested on the series, you can expect close to 2 hours of absolute eye-candy alongside lovable characters to push the narrative. <br />
<br />
The music is kind of like a rehash of its prequel but with some tweaks here and there LiSA had a new song released for the movie so, you already know it&#039;s gonna be good. <br />
<br />
What makes the characters so loved by fans is the relatability, vulnerability and simply the humane aspect of what makes us human. There is insane depth across the entire series of Demon Slayer, and it mostly dabbles across lifelong regrets, reasons to tread an uncertain or simply to live in a just way for the sake of others or perhaps one&#039;s own convictions that are so powerful that it carries not just themselves but through their sheer willpower, bringing along followers and supporters in kind. <br />
<br />
Needless to say, given the hype of the anime the voice actors are quite possibly A-Listers within the industry for the new cast. The movie was a real roller coaster it had me going from start till the end and I already knew what was coming. It just had that level of captivity and emotional pull that really attracted every bit of my attention. <br />
<br />
The writer of the story is a true master in her craft, to link such powerful emotions within a story that flows through so seamlessly requires great skill indeed, although the music and voice acting were instrumental to evoke emotions we discount the power of the narrative as the base for such talent to come into play. <br />
<br />
Every bit of Demon Slayer and its conflict never felt forced or perhaps ludicrously added to generate drama, the progression is logical and smooth so much that it creates a true masterpiece. My only disappointment is that a Season 2 hasn&#039;t been announced. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re reading this you&#039;re clearly a Demon Slayer &quot;Kimetsu no Yaiba&quot; Fan. If not, give the series a go, you might be one of us sooner than you think.

    I&#039;m not a big fan of the Kimetsu no Yaiba, but my friends are.<br />
<br />
For the story, it is somehow repeated in many movies and games, like FF8 or JOJO part5. some characters are overrated, I don&#039;t really like how the show Tanjiro&#039;s mind as the purest thing on earth. I didn&#039;t like his character, to begin with, each time he has to cry or over-react in the events. It&#039;s only my opinion.<br />
<br />
But, I have to be fair and say that the graphics in the movie was amazing. The movie was a great production and I don&#039;t regret watching the movie. <br />

    The story starts from where the anime left, the mugen train. As a part of the main story this movie fully illustrates its main theme which revolves around the train. As a sequel to the anime its great that the story shifts to new characters, also introducing new elements like dream, awesome techniques etc. Its also refreshing to see the Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke develop in strength and capabilities. The art was excellent, detailing every bits, all the scenes and lighting takes the audience into the movie, which is a great experience. Most of all, the emotions and encouragement it shares is absolutely mind blowing and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367016">
        gives strength to all the hearts of audience. It teaches us that we need to strive hard for our goals to be fulfilled, and to have a meaningful life which will lead to our success in the afterlife.

    Overrated, Overrated ,Overrated. I kept hearing this and tbh I had no expectations of demon slayer movie. But.. I was wronge.<br />
<br />
One of the most important things about a story for me is how it impacts you.. And it did just that for me atleast. Rengoku s philosphy and ideal did hit me personally on how everyone tries hard to live with challenges and everything. And by the end of it all we need support of others to live our lives because being a human is all about having humanity and by losing this humanity a person becomes a demon in reality as well and how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367794">
        death basically gives meaning to life and how without it, we cannot appreciate the little struggles we have in our daily lives.. Tbh I was inclined to do this review out of sheer frustration due to the hate ds gets<br />
But I guess its true that you will either love the show ALOOOT or you will Hate the show ALOOT<br />
<br />
Story:9/10 <br />
Not ground breaking but not too cliched and overall a gripping story that gets your attention immediately. Fairly understandable as well.<br />
One of the things that i personally like about ds story though is how it never does what its not suppose to(Something which alot of shounen tend to do)or goes out of its way to become something its not suppose to in other words it doesnt try to stand out and the themes it potrays(Regarding family,Human nature, hierchy etc). It is what i describe as a true shounen. Its simple, linear and something it between basic and unique. HOwever the thing is u need to focus on some parts to get what the story is actually tring to potray because the themes of the series are actually quiet deep but the story is pretty basic and tbh its due to the themes for which i think it desrves a 9.<br />
However i would like to point out that The abilities of demons are something that I for one find very unique in the story. I mean using shockwaves with martial arts,Dreams and nightmares to destroy the soul,turining a machine into your flesh etc The breathing though needs a little bit of interpretation and are not completely unique or as incredible comparatively(STill really neat and interesting) but the blood demon arts are really great.<br />
<br />
Art:10/10<br />
The pinnacle of 2d animation. I saw fate heavens feel movie 3 and thought nothing can undo that but ufotable crew always out do themselves I guess. It was beautiful and And a treat for the eyes<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
Yuki kaijura and lisa. No need for elaboration when those 2 are involved<br />
<br />
Character:8/10 <br />
Rengoku is one of the main reasons for a high score. His character is pretty great to say the least if u understand his ideals that is. I should add that rengoku is already a developed character and we actually see a potrayal of what he is in the movie and how it effects all the other characters. Still side characters need a little juice but tanjiro and rengoku as whole were the stars of this movie imo<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:10/10 <br />
I enjoyed alooot. The movie was a roller coaster of emotions. The dream part then the final 30 minutes I believe the first 40 mins and the last 30 mins are that truely  makes it magnificent<br />
<br />
Overall 9<br />
I had low expectations personally but it delieverd the hype in my opinion. The thing is demon slayer is quite balanced as a story( YOu can have a complain regarding the comedy to some extent though) and it has so many elements that u can atleast like one of them with addition to this it is for a large group of audience.<br />
It might sound a bit weird but its simplicity is what in my opinion makes it so beautiful for which i am willing to give it a high score i suppose<br />
However I dont have any intention of raising your expectations that much. So keep your expectations low. Because as i explained that its neither unique nor copied completely and the only way you will hate it  is if you have very high expectations.<br />
But demon slayer touchs many subjects regarding human nature and is enjoyable , so I would say ignore the hate(Its a different story if you are a hater your self)and go for it. <br />

    i watched the movie today. I feel it was one of the best shonen anime movie i have ever watched. <br />
Story: 8  <br />
  For me , demon slayer has strong story for a shonen. it was very good. i did read the manga but i still felt the emotions while watching the movie.<br />
 Character 7:<br />
  The character development was pretty average. I expected more of Rengoku. But  the movie has enough of Rengoku but i still wanted to know more. The others I feel it was pretty good.<br />
 Sound: 10<br />
 Sound effects were amazing. The theme was also good<br />
  Art:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review366051">
        10 <br />
  NO WORDS!!! PEAK UFOTABLE. THE LAST 30 MINS BLEW MY MIND AWAY!!! I Feel the CGI Could have been a bit better. Rengoku has the best fight scenes. Tanjiro vs Enmu was also very good. <br />
  Enjoyment : 10 <br />
  Again i loved the movie. Enjoyed it!!<br />
  Overall : 9 <br />
 Demon slayer fans will love this movie. Amazing!!!. It is sad also but i wont spoil. PLEASE, PLEASE WATCH IT!!! Can&#039;t wait for season 2. <br />

    SO I just watched this anime yesterday with subtitles, and I must say this movie far exceeded my expectations by a big margin, and kudos to ufotable for making such a masterpiece, and Honestly in my opinion they took it to the next level on this one, most of you guys remember ep19 of the original anime series, but I swear they took it they the whole new level, where I can&#039;t imagine how will they make something more better than this, this is the pinnacle of the animtions style, quality, and good story execution, they literally made a simple arc in the manga a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369633">
        masterpiece, I trust me I want to nitpick on this movie, about the flaws in it, but the bad thing is that I can&#039;t any flaw in this movie, it does everything that it is supposed to do, even better than you can ever expect, UFOTABLE is god and my lord my savior, they made 2020 better by releasing this, MU DAY IS MADE AND I&#039;M BLESSED I BORN IN THIS TIME TO WITNESS THIS.... I&#039;m truly grateful to be born in this time to watch this one of a kind masterpiece, IT DESERVES THE HYPE<br />
<br />
SO HERE IS MY FINAL REVIEW:<br />
<br />
STORY - 8/10 (its good it&#039;s unique and its beautiful)<br />
<br />
ANIMATIONS - 20/10 (trust me if this type of animation can&#039;t imppess you then nothing can impress you, and you should probably get a life)<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS - 9/10(honestly we really see more of the other side of the characters in this movie, their harsh feelings for the enimies, and thier pain, especially tanjiro, (minor spoiler) even that pig headed guy also cried, which was pretty unexpected, so yeah it was a beautiful roller-coaster ride of emotions for me, and yeah nezuko was kawaiiiiii as usual<br />
<br />
SOUND - ending credits songs was beautiful, in between OST were beautiful, imo demon slayer sound designing team both SFX and music team are great, no complaints with that<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT - 20/10<br />
I enjoyed every moment of this movie, and Do not regret watching this, and I will definitely will watch it again<br />
<br />
OVERALL - 9.5/10<br />
yeah you will love this, if you can&#039;t I&#039;m sorry I can&#039;t understand you and your opinion, and probably keep it to yourself, and we can&#039;t be friends

    This is my first review if i say any wrong i apologize, [This review contains spoilers]<br />
<br />
sorry for my bad grammar.<br />
<br />
I watch this movie in 12/12/2020<br />
<br />
At first big problem i have to this movie show is character plot.<br />
<br />
This show have dame give too much force in Tanjirou which that make any change?<br />
&#039;nope&#039; although if the show dont put this, Tanjirou is still the same person does not cause any changes to the characters [ This show have give this Tanjirou plot in TV series already so it&#039;s no need to put this plot back again ] as a result, this anime did not expand the dimension

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369063">
        of other characters as well at all. Like Rengoku I can know just info of this character but I can&#039;t feel connected with this character at all because this show dont give a time to this can&#039;t give this character enough time.<br />
<br />
Second big problem i have to this show is action and comedy balance.<br />
<br />
But i didn&#039;t mean that action was bad it was great but the action scene is too stretched <br />
in the meantime comedy scene was used to greatly interrupt the tone of the anime<br />
some scene that should put but they not put [This show just put some little comedy scene in Rengoku died scene why....] making me not into it at all because I don&#039;t know how I should feel to that scene.<br />
<br />
Third big problem i have to this show is Enmu and Akaza<br />
<br />
Enmu don&#039;t have to tell everything you know please dam there is almost nothing exciting to continue watching becuse Enmu dialogue in first half of show [ In my opinions this show will be little greater if Enmu doesn&#039;t tell everything and let us continue to wait what will happen next ] <br />
Akaza what character dimension does this villain have? why this character accidentally  come across Tanjirou gang? This show never telling the reason this anime let scene turn into coincidence making conflicts in the matter by itself. [ Rui arc is definitely better ]<br />
<br />
This last big problem that i have to this show is the thing that I got from this anime<br />
<br />
What is the value of this show give to me i feel noting I couldn&#039;t feel anything from this show this show rarely offers any ideas I got almost nothing, I don&#039;t want just action scene I want to know about Rengoku for more but I didn&#039;t, I hardly got any ideas from the story.<br />
<br />
Overall is 4/10<br />
<br />
I my opinions i disappointed at this show I remember that TV series can do it butter and i hope that kimetsu no yaiba 2 will doing it better.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    I won&#039;t bother with a super long review. TLDR below.<br />
<br />
I am a simple man. <br />
I watched Demon Slayer movie. <br />
I liked how it rolled.<br />
So I enjoyed it and give it my praise.<br />
<br />
It is easy to go out of your way and poke where Demon Slayer&#039;s flaws and faults are and then use that to explode upon a cynical opinion of the series as a whole. And well, that is justifiable to some extent. Though it should be noted, who is Demon Slayer for? Is it for those seeking the most elegant of stories, the acme of literature? Or is it for those who simply seek

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396774">
        none other than hype content full of vibrant imagery? Any sane person would agree it is for the latter. Considering the demographic this is targetted at, and the stereotypical mindset of that demographic. It would be to no surprise that Demon Slayer is a simple battle shounen for those looking for nothing other than easy enjoyment.<br />
<br />
That is exactly what Demon Slayer&#039;s Mugen Train movie has. <br />
<br />
The narrative, admittedly, isn&#039;t anything to praise. I was actually intending to be rather cynical about it but I gave it the benefit of the doubt with a 6 instead of a 5, also because it was a movie rather than a TV anime with this segment. From the halfway switch-up in the plot in the middle of the story to the nothing but overused shounen tropes carrying character dialogue to the nakama power-ups, everyone seems to hate (good lord, did they even try to write something?). I simply cannot find anything to praise about the story. Likewise, I cannot find anything to hate about it too. It was merely generic. I could point out how the simple character in turn made this good, but I am going to have to stick to a critical look for the narrative on this one. I do find myself enjoying some character interactions though. But again, not exactly special. <br />
<br />
That isn&#039;t to say that Demon Slayer is bad. Because of course, the amazing audiovisuals carried this movie so much it legit broke box office records on a *global* scale. That isn&#039;t to say that profits are directly proportional to the quality, Demon Slayer had a TV series to boost its popularity anyways. But it goes to show that this visual spectacle was something everyone was waiting for, this doesn&#039;t just happen for any movie, though I understand Demon Slayer did a Konami code quite a bit. It was a lucky pick really. But I am glad out of all the Shounen Jump manga, Demon Slayer found itself on a bright path. As said, it is there for some easy enjoyment. In any case, this movie looked so amazing it is genuinely something I believe a good 99% of people will enjoy regardless of your stand on the series. The camerawork, fight choreography, scenery, hell even CGI. You name it and ufotable did a splendid job at making it amazing. Literally no words will do justice in this review. I strongly recommend you see it for yourself. The audio side of things is the same. I initially wanted to give the audio a 9 instead of a 10, but the variety of vocals, past soundtracks, and hype music was something to take into consideration and praise. Again, no justice here unless you see for yourself.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I enjoyed this movie a ton. I can&#039;t lie. I have trash-talked Demon Slayer before, a lot. But then everything had me thinking. This movie deserves every praise and (rational) criticism it has ever received. It is easy to hate popular series just because they are mid-tier but this isn&#039;t trying to be the next William Shakespeare or the next Charles Dickens. It is just some battle shounen that was lucky enough to get the correct team of people. And people really enjoy that. What makes this movie better is that it is a movie. Demon Slayer does 100 times as better when it is just mostly made up of action in the form of a movie. Part of the reason why I stopped the manga and found the anime dragging itself. I just wanted some brainless action lmao. Watch this as I both recommend this series, with effort, to all new to anime or not, and tell you this is a canon movie that needs to be watched to understand how this connects to before the 1st season, and how it will lead on in later arcs.<br />
<br />
I am a simple man. <br />
We are simple people. <br />
That is why this movie is so damn good. <br />
<br />
TLDR: This movie is amazing, mostly because of audiovisuals, but simplicity is something everyone loves.<br />
<br />
Overall - 9.03 (9, lowered significance of narrative. Ironic)<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I literally just finished this today and decided to write something on this quick. I watched this with a good friend of mine and I have to say discord y u do dis 4 :((((. But it was all cool. I thought it was fun to watch it with someone. I&#039;d recommend you do the same as well. You might enjoy it more. But enough cringe. Bye.<br />

    This is my first anime review, so bear with me here. There are some slight spoilers, so please be warned.<br />
<br />
Before I even begin to get into the meat and potatoes of this review, I just want to give my opinion on what should have been done. Simply put, this should not have been a stand alone movie. This should have been part of a second season. It did not have the strength in any category besides art and sound to thrive around other amazing movies that have come out in recent years.<br />
<br />
Excitement does not even begin to describe the anticipation I felt going into this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394155">
        movie. After watching the original series and being very satisfied, Demon Slayer: Mugen Train, the highest selling Japanese movie in the box office ever, should have been a mind-blowing experience, filled with great story, breathtaking animation, and amazing characters. Sadly, only one of those statements turned out to be true.<br />
<br />
I wish I could at least say that the movie was somewhat enjoyable, but I literally found myself falling asleep multiple times through the movie. So lets begin this reivew.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
It comes as no surprise that Ufotable have delivered yet another artistic masterpiece. Keep in mind that I saw this movie in theaters when I say what I am about to say. The movie starts, and the opening scene with the trees starts to roll. I turned to my friend and asked, &quot;What trailer is this?&quot; He replied, without sarcasm, &quot;I think this is the Rurouni Kenshin live action trailer.&quot; It was only until Kagaya showed up on the screen when I realized that I was watching the Demon Slayer. That&#039;s how realistic the backgrounds were. Moreover, the Rengoku and Akaza fight was one of the craziest fights I have ever seen, not to mention this movie boasting impressive 3D animation. It would feel wrong giving this movie&#039;s art anything less that a 10.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
Seeing this movie in theaters, I was a little disappointed in the sound quality, although the cinema it was playing in is to blame. Simply put, the OST for this movie was breathtaking, bringing back one of my favorite tracks from the first season, Rui&#039;s theme. As always, Ufotable brought their very best when it came to effects too. All in all, the quality was very solid, and lived up to the reputation that Ufotable has gained for it&#039;s sound design.<br />
<br />
Characters: 4<br />
Unfortunately, the pros for Demon Slayer: Mugen Train end at the sound design, because everything else about this movie was at the very most, average. The characters introduced this movie were bland, uninteresting, and boring. The only newly introduced character in this movie that I thought was somewhat acceptable was Rengoku, but even he wasn&#039;t anything special. Honestly, the &#039;darker&#039; parts of this movie were a complete and utter joke. You could tell that the writers were trying so hard to emotionally captivate you, but between the terribly written jokes and the appalling story, there was nothing to get attached to. Tanjiro was as average as he was in the first season. Zenitsu literally gets 10 minute of on screen time, if that. Inosuke, while enjoyable to watch, has no depth to him that makes you want to know more. (Nezuko however, is amazing as always). All in all, the characters in this movie were subpar, to say the least.<br />
<br />
Story: 2<br />
In terms of story alone, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The first 20 minutes of the movie are boring setup, followed by another 30 minutes of &#039;rising action&#039;, which felt like millennia. On top of that, there was little to no climax. It almost felt like the writers didn&#039;t know where to highest point of the movie, so they just made the entire second half a steady descending peak. You thought Enmu was the big boss? Nope. Instead, another demon that we have never met before comes out of literal nowhere, and starts fighting Rengoku. It made so little sense, that I could not concentrate on the thing that makes Demon Slayer so great; the art.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4<br />
This movie was a disappointment in terms of enjoyment. Sure, the first season of Demon Slayer may not have been critically amazing, but at least it was super fucking enjoyable. This on the other hand literally had me falling asleep at times. I didn&#039;t give a single shit about any of the characters, as they were made to be shallow and uninteresting, and I didn&#039;t think any of the writing was enjoyable. What I did enjoy, however, were the fights. Holy shit, Ufotable went so hard, especially with the Rengoku fight.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
This movie was disappointing. I went into it hoping for an action packed, emotional, and fun movie, but left with a mediocre OVA. If you love Demon Slayer and it&#039;s characters, I would 100% recommend this movie. If you were iffy about the show, maybe this isn&#039;t for you. I am giving this a 6 for the time being strictly based on how stellar the production was. Nothing else. If this movie had the same story and characters, but had mediocre art and sound, this would be the worst movie I have ever seen.

    Music: Since I&#039;m a big fan of kajiura yuki, 12/10. <br />
<br />
Story: 7. Nothing special, but still a decent shounen. Personally don&#039;t like the comedy that kinda ruined the pacing. Other than that no special flaws or special <br />
<br />
Characters are the usual likeable bunch. And then we have the fire pillar who&#039;s straightforward and also easily likeable. Just a swell dude basically who&#039;s also really reliable. Nothing too special but then that one scene did it for me. <br />
<br />
Visuals: Ranging between 6-10, depending on the exact time of the movie. A mixed opinion here. The cg is weird and out of place but the drawn action

          <span style="display: none;" id="review364925">
        sequences are pumped with budget. <br />
<br />
Overall: has to split the movie into different parts because the 3d cgi really ruined certain parts for me.  <br />
First 100 minutes of the movie: I&#039;ll give it a 7. Again, the story isn&#039;t anything special, humour is fun but breaks up the pacing a bit much, don&#039;t like the cgi, but there are cool moments in there and the music kept me entertained. <br />
<br />
Last 20 minutes of the movie: 9. Beautiful. Beautifully animated combat that are almost too fast to keep up. Everything is drawn instead of cgi, a fast-paced brawl, heavy in emotions, amazing music as always.<br />
<br />
A certain 5 minute section of the whole film: it&#039;s not the most intense fight animation, but damn, the emotional weight is there, just like that one episode in the season 1 anime. The voice acting was impeccable and it really hits home. <br />
<br />
All in all, a very demon slayer movie: a decent enough storyline sprinkled with good action here and there. Then the climate hits, and it hits like a train, making it so much better than what it usually is and bringing the whole show to a new height. Kajiura and ufotable has always been the perfect combo since kara no kyoukai and this is no exception. It has its issues, but still a really entertaining movie. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll give it a 9, 1 point courtesy to that 5 minute section and 1 point to kajiura&#039;s music (so it would&#039;ve been 7 otherwise)

    When i first saw the news, saying this movie has surpassed Spirited Away and became the no 1 top grossing film in japan, i just couldn&#039;t believe it.<br />
<br />
As a manga reader, i didn&#039;t remember that this part of the story was worthy of being the top. But then, i decided to watch it today, and well as you can see from my score, it blew my mind.<br />
<br />
Kimetsu no Yaiba has done it again. Even though this is a sequel of an anime series, it still manage to overthrow the no 1 spot, which was an original anime movie (not related to any series) and they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review372032">
        surely did not fail to deliver the expectations that people gave.<br />
<br />
Story wise, it continues exactly where the series end, and from what i remembered before watching the movie, this part of the story is one of the most important ones, and i must say it again, Ufotable did not fail to deliver.<br />
<br />
What kimetsu has that no other anime had, was their animation. While we all know the series was a masterpiece in terms of animation, they surpassed my expectations for the movie. It&#039;s been a while since the series ended and i forgot how beautiful the animations were, and they did amazingly for the movie. The details of the breathing techniques, the sheer amount of work that has putted on the character&#039;s emotions and expressions, this is truly has earned a spot in my heart.<br />
<br />
Laughter, sorrow, excitement, i was completely overwhelmed by emotions as i watch the movie. While the animations may have been the thing that separates this movie from others, i couldn&#039;t just not talk about the story telling that this anime has given. Yes, it&#039;s an action anime, yes the fighting is what people love about the movie, but just the way they portray the characters ambitions and resolve is what i think is worthy to also be praised.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me started on the OSTs, my god it is truly a masterpiece. When godly animations is paired with masterpiece soundtracks, what you get is this movie. So since this movie is still airing in some countries, please i beg of you, watch it in the theater! The OSTs is too beautiful to not be listened in a theater&#039;s sound system.<br />
<br />
And for those people who hasn&#039;t seen this movie, let me give you an advice. As the movie ends and the credits start, pay attention to the artwork and Homura by LiSA in the end credits. I&#039;m one of those fools who checks their phone while the credits was rolling and i truly regret it until now.<br />
<br />
Lastly, i want to thank Ufotable and their team that has once again successfully deliver a masterpiece. Please, watch it in theaters while it still airing, because you may regret not watching it with those big speakers.<br />
<br />
Yours truly,<br />
Senaya

    Let&#039;s start with the negative first. The film itself lasts almost 2 hours, and there are 2 villains. One of them is useless, and seriously because not only does that one villain have no role but the whole part with him is completely unnecessary and in no way contributes to the development of the story. In addition, too much time was wasted here to suggest that the things that happen to the main characters are used for their character development, which did not happen. There’s also the classic problem of many shonen stories, and that’s bad writing of villains and by that I mean both,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review380097">
        and especially the initial villain who’s only there to be a punching bag. The next problem is related to the last third of the film, first of all there is an attempt to draw some so-called philosophy that is not well realized. Next up are those dialogues that are catastrophically poorly written, and there&#039;s also the end of a film that creates excessive pathos from very not-sad things. Now let&#039;s get to the good stuff. First of all, the film immediately begins without summarizing previous events and the occasional extra word about the power system. And of course the animation is very good with very detailed and fluid fights, and the music is a bit weaker than in the series, but still very good that contributes to the hype in the action scenes.

    Finally, this movie was released in my country (in Asia) since last weekend, and surprisingly, almost all the reaction/review for it are very positive from both fan and non-fan/just casual movie goers.<br />
Many people who are not into anime much (to be honest, anime movies often don&#039;t do well in my country box office) still really like it after watching. <br />
----------------<br />
My reviews:<br />
_Visual and sound: no need to talk more. 10/10.<br />
_Content: Good meanings and messages which can resonate well with the audience. Reasonable framed. Handle sittuations properly. No random asspull power-up. There is time to focus on each character to develop and emphasize their role, leave the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367883">
        impression on audience. The producer team knows how to choose the starting point and end point so that audience in general can enjoy the movie. Through out the movie, there are good meanings and messages that can resonate well with audience (especially for Japanese people due to culture and lifestyle I think). 8.5/10<br />
Overall: 9.25/10
