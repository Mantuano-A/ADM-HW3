    Sincerely KyoAni<br />
<br />
Humans understand their feelings. Especially important people. A new era is coming with the passage of time. Everyone dies someday. Someone who a person met becomes precious existence for that person. The core is love. Even if people never going to see each other, they live eternally in their hearts. Violet Evergarden. She and this series title are symbolizing life strength. We are the same, too. Life is Treasure.<br />
<br />
Violet finally could know the meaning of &quot;love&quot; in TV series. The word is involved in this sequel deeply. Telling some emotions by a letter has mental imagination. Ulysse. He is one of the new characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356366">
        in this series. His depiction is connecting Violet and Gilbert&#039;s destinies. In a word, every character is well-written in terms of development. Violet is still thinking everything of Gilbert. She is a doll but not just a doll. She is an automatic doll named pure human. Violet is continuing to write letters for many people. The root can also be said her dear Gilbert. Their relationship is straightforward in a good way and very emotional. Violet and Gilbert are thinking about each other a lot. The feeling means their true way of life. Like we are living in these peaceful ages without war, Violet and Gilbert are also living in their place so hard. That&#039;s why many people never stop living for something purposes. Strong or Weak. These are symbols of this movie. Humans die in the future. I even don&#039;t know when I would be dying.<br />
<br />
As a whole style, This movie is full of characters crying. Not your typical melodrama. I felt like this movie is a love story more than TV series. It depends on you whether this is good or not. To me, it was very sweet. I have moved a certain scene so much. I cried many times while watching this movie. Combined with the effect, the voice acting was top-notch. Yui Ishikawa (Violet), Daisuke Namikawa (Gilbert), Takehito Koyasu (Hodgins) did really stellar job. Their voice acting gave me an admirable impact. Not only characters moving but you should concentrate on every voice including three casts. Of course, art is also splendid. Beautiful, detailed, glorious. Really flawless. You can understand why KyoAni is one of the best anime studios. Music and theme songs are very wonderful, too.<br />
<br />
I can say this is the perfect sequel. You should watch this finale. No regrets.<br />
Thank You, KyoAni. I&#039;ll never forget this holy masterpiece.

    THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER-FREE<br />
<br />
As the death-causing waves of COVID-19 continue to encounter all parts of the globe, one may understand how lackluster the world is without theatre movies - one of the most recreational industries of humankind. The fact that no movies were produced, or even recorded, for 5 or 6 months really hits the industry into its core, and casts a big doubt on its survival.<br />
<br />
Luckily, the debut of several movies during this crisis has just confirmed that the community has its capability to overcome the difficulties. And to be honest, it was much more outstanding than I&#039;ve ever imagined.<br />
<br />
The latest movie of Demon

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367473">
        Slayer was a good example, a remarkable debut and a truly wonderful cure for the whole community indeed. Everyone is talking about it, everyone is hoping this will act as a catalyst for more to come out.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not an exception of this, but to be honest my intention was left on something else, something that may truly helps me gain back my fading interest... <br />
<br />
Violet Evergarden Movie.<br />
<br />
I have just finished it with my warming tears hooking on my face all along at the theater. I didn&#039;t even remember where was the last time I cried so much like this...<br />
<br />
Where should I start with...<br />
<br />
The story was introduced in a quite unfamiliar way, which may distract or confuse viewers a bit thereafter. But from my perspective, it acts as a guide for the whole story to be smoothly displayed and thereby more easily grabs their intention. As the story continues to progress, you&#039;ll have the chance to meet both new and appeared characters, each will leave a mark on the story as a whole.<br />
<br />
What I love most in this plot is that everything was set and done exquisitely, a proper pace we&#039;ve all seen in this franchise to a decent amount of time separated for each scene to develop and expand the story, and the position flashback scenes which makes viewers cry so bad. Such great works KyoAni have finished, that every words, every expressions and actions matter.<br />
<br />
Several friends of mine told me that the plot was what they did not found difficult to predict, and surprisingly they were right. It was indeed a drawback of this movie where the actions and conversations at the beginning indicated way too many details, which should have better been revealed in the middle or later of the story. Having said that, when the final phase of the movie was displayed and as your delicate heart were already step-by-step melted, it shattered yours and in the meantime pushed the whole story into a breathtaking finale.<br />
<br />
The BGM and SFX of this movie is, from my perspective, the most successful and indispensable part of it. Old OSTs were played all along the movie, which really hit me with nostalgia and fill me up with fresh feelings that I&#039;ve been new to for ages. The sounds of nature, the birds, the river, the waves of the ocean, the sadness in rainy scenes were absolutely incredible. Crucial conversations were remarkably emphasized by wonderful soundtracks at the beginning but then just relied on characters&#039; voice soon after, which makes them more genuine and in a more aesthetic viewpoint. And of course, why should not I mention the appearance of &quot;Michishirube&quot; at the end of the movie, which was somehow sounded way much better than any versions and in any situations in the anime series.<br />
<br />
And not to forget the visuals, still as outstanding as usual. The characters were beautifully designed, each of whom possessed a unique look as well as a distinguished way of understanding and acting. And how about the landscapes? They are all delicately polished to the smallest details, which gave them a more real and lively look, as to highlight the meaning of each scene taken spot on them.<br />
<br />
The conclusion of the movie is something I adore so much, but the point is that I&#039;ve never read the novel so it&#039;s not objective to say which one is better. To be honest, a happy ending is all I wanted after being shredded in pieces by the story and my own feelings, and I appreciated that they did not disappoint me... However, the changing of the sky color in the final part was something unrealistic. What I mean by that is, the way they changed the sky color in order to emphasized the contents (as it shifted from day to dawn then dust relatively) was quite unusual and not as successful as they expected it to be.<br />
<br />
The movie, even though not flawless, is still something real authentic and fresh that may drive our feelings through this crisis. It&#039;s not actually the one that marks the return of KyoAni after its 2019 tragedy, but it&#039;s believed that Violet Evergarden Movie will set a high standard for any movies coming out after it.<br />
<br />
So, if you feel life is boring and want something fresh, or you are desperate for more anime after you hyped up with Demon Slayer movie, then this is the one for you. I won&#039;t add any further details that may ruin your feelings or your expectations, I&#039;m just here to firmly tell you that the movie is amazing and you should give it a try.<br />
<br />
Take a deep breath, close your eyes, let the music flowing in your mind and take you along until the very end of the journey.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#039;t need me anymore, so let&#039;s not meet&quot; - when I heard that, my heart dropped like hers must&#039;ve did. <br />
<br />
<br />
I liked the direction. The movie started from the perspective of the great granddaughter of one of Violet&#039;s clients, who became entranced after reading the letters much treasured throughout the years. We&#039;re shown the cruel reality of dolls being put out of business by advancements in technology, namely the telephone. However, this did not deter our temporary protagonist from travelling to the post office where it all took place, which has been turned into a museum. <br />
<br />
<br />
The film jumped to Violet&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356354">
        perspective at this point, after a brief recap. She had just delivered a song of praise for the seas, in a ceremony so formal I was worried she might be indoctrinated back into the army. <br />
<br />
<br />
Then just as suddenly, we&#039;re shown a flash of the life of a man on an unknown island. It looks post apocalyptic, I wasn&#039;t sure it was in the present. The hair and eyes of the male character looked familiar; where have I seen him before? You might already be able to guess his identity based on the trailer, but lots of questions arose. Why didn&#039;t he attempt to come back if he was alive? Did he lose his memory? Well, you&#039;ll have to watch to find out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yulice&#039;s (not sure the English spelling) story was also bittersweet, and I liked how Violet&#039;s professionalism and weight she put together in their promise helped her make up her mind on giving up on the Major. The regret she shown was very admirable to say the least, as she realised the impossibility to fulfill his final request during the storm. <br />
<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t express my feelings in words now. All in all, the whole framing was so great, everyone was crying throughout the movie. My only qualm is how much Gilbert was romanticized in the anime series, but he is actually a shallow PoS in the movie. Luckily his brother and our dear Hodgins managed to bring him to his senses, else it might&#039;ve been a sad ending. For that, the only category I won&#039;t be rating 10 is Character.

    Holy shit. Coming to Japan in order to watch this movie was one of my best decisions this year. Mere month after I&#039;ve seen final Fate/stay night Heaven&#039;s Feel movie I come back this time to Kyoto. Is it better than super hit from ufotable? It doesn&#039;t matter actually, I&#039;m speechless. And in love. TV series has few flaws, plot pretty bland and predictable, simplified to the border. But I still loved it, because all these things weren&#039;t actually problematic as Violet Evergarden never pretended to be something else than beautiful story about understanding what love is. And it was damn beautiful. And this movie

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356351">
        took it whole level up.<br />
<br />
STORY: 8<br />
So how this 140 minutes long movie looks compared to its prequel? Well, much, much better. It went full melodrama mode. Movie pick up the story basically where 2018 TV show left. Violet is unable to forget about Gilbert and don&#039;t want to believe he&#039;s gone forever. Even everyone told her to move on. The MAL synopsis doesn&#039;t give much justice to the actual movie plot, but on the other hand... it&#039;s somewhat perfect. This nearly two-and-a-half hour long movie throws us pretty fast in the story and it&#039;s damn hard to avoid spoilers at this point. Enough tho say, that Violet herself is at her limit and anything can broke her faith and feelings she just learned to understand. As for romantic melodrama pacing is damn fast and story and directing doesn&#039;t give much time to process the story. But it ain&#039;t flaw, actually it&#039;s better for the plot and it&#039;s heartbreaking twists. Trust me, even with no spoilers, you&#039;ll need napkins. This movie doesn&#039;t take prisoners, you&#039;ll cry. Especially changes towards Light Novel went even deeper than in TV series. And I&#039;m happy of that, especially when it comes to the finale. Trust me, you can expect suprises, even tho it&#039;s still bit predictable. But it was to be expected. It&#039;s Violet Evergarden at her finest. <br />
<br />
ART: 10<br />
Honestly, this movie is fucking breathtaking. KyoAni did another masterwork, quality of animation is just speechless. Such a beauty, starting from flawless and even more enhanced character designs, throught amazingly animated action and dynamic scenes, finishing on backgrounds and planning. Animation is flawless, smooth and better than ever. Colours, quality, shadows, all location and character designs is just top of the top notch. If it comes to animation this year, no one can stand next to this masterfully crafted work, except ufotable of course. And even that, it&#039;s extremely hard to compare this animation to anything I&#039;ve ever seen. Work of pure art, such a beauty that leaves you literally speechless. KyoAni outdone themselves. <br />
<br />
SOUND: 10<br />
It&#039;s KyoAni, sound quality is over the top. Perfectly synced, beautifully fitting every second of this movie. All-star seiyuu squad did work of the year, next to final F/sn movie, can&#039;t actually decide which is better. Voicing is perfect, leaves no doubt that it&#039;s real piece of art. There&#039;s soul and love in every dialogue, feelings and power is everywhere, it&#039;s a work full of dedication and understanding. Both, for characters and audience. Then we have beautifully crafted atmosphere, world is full of life and ambient sounds are just perfect. And finally we have soundtrack. Evan Call outshine himself once again, music is beautiful, very soft, but at the same moment powerful. It&#039;s extremely well fit the melodramatic atmosphere and works both, as perfect piece of work that hit you straight into heart and separate album, will get it asap. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 9<br />
As before, this movie stands mostly on characters. But this time psychological portraits are deeper and much more detailed. Violet struggling with herself, her feelings, beliefs and past even more than before. It can be truly heartbreaking at one point. This time Dietfried, Gilbert&#039;s brother received much more screen time and his character is much deeper and more clarity than before. Finally we can completely understand him, his pain and he went throught. In the past and now. Fortunately rest of the supporting characters got just enough time and plot to actually, unlike the TV series, be much more important to both, Violet and audiences. I mean that this time every important character, starting from Claudia finishing on Cattleya have important task and deepened characteristics and psychological portrait. It&#039;s a huge step forward comparing to the prequel and deserves praise. This time characters are on the first plane, including the most important one next to Violet. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 9<br />
The movie heavily plays on the feelings, even more that TV series. But taking whole melodrama to another level it was pretty predictable. Enjoyment is top notch, but can be literally painful at some point. Before you visit your nearest cinema, ensure you have enough tissues on you. I&#039;ll not spoil anything, but it&#039;s Violet Evergarden, so trust me, you&#039;ll need them. Enjoyment overall is great, you&#039;ll sit on the edge of your seats, you&#039;ll feel, laugh and cry with the characters. And you&#039;ll love Violet even more than before. Such a powerful chatacter. Once again she&#039;s having literally whole production on her shoulders, but this time, there&#039;s no flaws. Enjoyment, even hurtful sometimes is outstanding. It&#039;s a perfect entertainment. And perfect sequel, without a doubt it&#039;s the best return for KyoAni after the tragedy. Beautiful. <br />
<br />
OVERALL: 10<br />
It&#039;s 10. Second best anine movie I&#039;ve seen this year. Extremely poignant, beautifully crafted, with beautiful, bit predictable, but still satisfying plot. It&#039;s an perfect example of closing a story and hitting deep into soul of its viewer. This anime movie is not only the best closure for the story, but actually is better in everything than its prequel TV series. It&#039;s deep, touching and full of extremely different feels. Will leave you speechless, shocked and ultimately satisfied, even if you didn&#039;t like prequel. KyoAni managed to achieve something very rare, they delivered satisfying, amazingly crafted epilogue to this story that&#039;s actually better than ever before. 140 minutes long runtime gives perfect amount of time to answer all unanswered questions, to deliver beautiful romance and extremely touching story. It&#039;s a masterpiece on its own rights. And beautiful tribute to all these people that died in this awful fire. Is it better than final Fate movie? Probably not, but it manages to stand next to it like equal. Terrible year for humanity, but great year for anime. This is how you craft masterpieces, even if you don&#039;t agree. Beauty.<br />
<br />
Long live Kyoto Animation. <br />
<br />
And get bloody tissues, you&#039;ll need them. <br />

    I see that all of the first 3 reviews gave this movie a perfect 10/10. I can understand where their opinion comes from and respect people who think this was a perfect ending for Violet&#039;s story, but I have to personally disagree and give this film a 7/10. It&#039;s still far better than average, but the ending misses the mark entirely for me. I will state my reasons below, first in a spoiler-free section and then in a spoiler section.<br />
<br />
Before I begin, full disclaimer that I have NOT read the novel, and so the source of my complaint is not &quot;it is different from the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356643">
        original so it sux0rZ!!1!&quot;. I am simply giving my thoughts on the story progression and why I was so let down.<br />
<br />
Spoiler-free section:<br />
First, let me start off by saying that I loved a lot about this movie. The voice-acting was on-point, not just from Violet&#039;s actress, but also her boss Hodgins, and even side characters they introduce as one-offs in the movie. No complaints whatsoever about any of the performances. The animation was the usual golden standard from Kyoto Animation - breathtaking at parts, and exactly what we&#039;ve come to expect over the years. The soundtrack is no slouch, either. The orchestra works well as it has done in the TV series and previous &quot;Gaiden&quot; movie, and the ending song from True fits very well within the film&#039;s atmosphere and emotions.<br />
<br />
So, if all those elements were perfect or near-perfect, what kept the movie from the perfect 10/10, or even a 9 or 8 for me? 2 words: &quot;the ending&quot; - arguably the most important part of any story that seeks to be emotionally satisfying. The last 20 minutes of the film were extremely underwhelming for me, try as the film did to make me emotionally satisfied with the conclusion to Violet&#039;s story. Now I can&#039;t go into the details without spoilers, but suffice it to say that, speaking for myself, I saw it as a disappointing end to Violet&#039;s character arc. Not only was it wholly predictable, leaning on some of the most cliche tropes used in media, but it also (in my personal opinion) betrayed a lot of the character development and buildup for Violet throughout the anime series. I found myself thinking, &quot;oh god, they&#039;re not going in that direction, are they?&quot; right before the climax of the film, but lo and behold, they went in that direction.<br />
<br />
Well, now that I&#039;ve outlined my big complaint without spoilers, I&#039;ll get into the meat of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
---SPOILERS SECTION---<br />
Throughout the anime series, Violet learns through her chosen profession what it means to be independent, what it means to feel, what it means to love. Violet started out as a robotic, emotionally damaged literal doll who could not function without orders from a superior officer. Throughout her encounters across the land writing letters for various clients, each with their own story arc, and interacting with the supporting cast at her workplace, Violets learns to think for herself, to act on her own desires, and, slowly but surely, understand what it means to feel &quot;love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, some people may argue that this was all leading up to Violet reuniting with Gilbert, telling him &quot;I love you,&quot; and living happily ever after with her former commanding officer-turned-lover. And those people will find this fairy tale ending perfectly satisfying - the ship is complete. Nothing more to say.<br />
<br />
But thinking back on the TV series, I can&#039;t help but question, &quot;Really, is that all it was this whole time? A long, roundabout romance story?&quot; Because if that&#039;s all this was, then I must say that I&#039;ve given more credit to the emotional maturity of this series than I should have. Forgive me if I sound harsh, but I think I&#039;ve spend way too much time with Violet on her journey, looking on as if I was growing and maturing with an old friend, to simply be given an &quot;and they lived happily ever after&quot; ending, with no strings attached, complete with the &quot;dash to the port/airport&quot; cliche and the &quot;jump off the boat to rush to shore and embrace lover&quot; cliche.<br />
<br />
Even if it is implied that Violet has grown as a person and changed from the Violet who fought under Gilbert out of dependency to a Violet who chooses to be with Gilbert out of love, it still makes her character completely revolve around one person, and boils her storyline down to &quot;girl reunites with boy after being separated after war.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gilbert understood that Violet would again dedicate everything to her old master if he returned to her life, and that&#039;s why he hid out in the middle of nowhere all this time. So why, after sticking to this decision for years, did he have a change of heart in one moment with just one letter? Was he that fickle? Did he not think things through when he decided to play dead? Was he just horny? It just doesn&#039;t make any sense.<br />
<br />
And we are led to believe that Violet grew old and died peacefully with the same man who she had supposedly become independent from, who supposedly was no longer the sole thing about which her world revolved? The ending just becomes a more emotionally unsatisfying mess the more I think about it. It&#039;s as if the director/writer said, &quot;Look, I know Violet has matured a lot over the years, but she needs a happily-ever-after ending with Gilbert no matter what happened in between. That&#039;s what the audiences want and expect, so that&#039;s what we&#039;ll give them. Oh, and let&#039;s throw in a scene of Violet bawling her eyes out while hugging Gilbert in there so the audience will feel happy for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
I&#039;m going to stop here before it becomes a rant, but needless to say, if the ending had been more nuanced, less cliched, and given Violet (and the audience) more credit, I think the movie could have been a perfect 10/10. But as is, I cannot, because the straightforward ending simply did not live up to the quality of everything that came before. Still a solid movie besides the ending, so 7/10 overall.

    The Violet Evergarden Movie is a huge disappointment in term of what it means for violet as a character. The ending to this movie does a complete 180 on violet journey as a character. Violet regresses back to a lesser form of herself by the end of the movie and it&#039;s depressing to see. Too see Violet who are the start of her journey felt incomplete without gilbert and said her life had no meaning beside being his &quot;tool&quot;. Too someone by the end of the story who understood what love meant through its form of friendship, partners, and family. While also finding a career

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394010">
        that fulfilled her, friends she could rely on, a father figure through Hodgins. Too see her literally throw away all she gains just so she can be on some island in the middle of nowhere with gilbert. This just felt like a spit in the face of her journey as she reverts back to square one. The movie makes it clear that gilbert all violet needs to be happy but that shouldn&#039;t be all that she deserves. Violet journey sadly by the end of movie meant almost nothing as she reverts to someone that feels like gilbert is her master.<br />

    “What’s the matter?”-Gilbert<br />
“It’s your eyes. It’s the same color as your eyes. The way I felt when I saw this. This feeling. What is it called?”-Violet<br />
<br />
*This review contains heavy spoilers*<br />
<br />
If you watched Violet Evergarden, you know this is ‘love’.<br />
<br />
We never knew the extent of Major Gilbert’s love until this sequel was created. And what did we learn: It’s romantic love. Now we know why young Violet aged from 14 to 18 between the TV series and the movie…<br />
<br />
One might ask, &quot;What? How is this possible? Aren&#039;t they like a father and daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
My dear friends, this is possible thanks to the &#039;love knows no bounds&#039; romance

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418172">
        archetype, but allow myself to explain.<br />
<br />
Initially, Major Gilbert was established as a man who sacrificed his life for Violet to live on. In the movie, we learn that he’s alive. <br />
<br />
Looking back at the exact ending of the TV series, why does the prequel end with Violet looking surprised and then suddenly smiling? Is it because she found Gilbert? Well, in the movie, the scene where Violet finds Gilbert happens in a completely different way because she was with Hodges when that actually happened. Or maybe the prequel was all…’foreshadowing’.<br />
<br />
Aside from the questionable ending, there are two questions raised when watching this revelation in the movie: why didn’t Gilbert go looking for Violet and how did Gilbert become who he is? We don’t learn the answer to these adequately in the backstory, post-Great War, and he just becomes a teacher. Gilbert didn’t even bother looking for Violet, let alone anyone else. At the end of the movie, it is stated that Gilbert just wanted to ‘live a new life’ which makes Gilbert look worse than Subaru in the S1 confession scene. He supposedly wanted to stop the non-existent pain he caused Violet by watching over her during wartime, which means he didn’t understand or want to understand Violet’s feelings for 4 whole years. What also makes even less sense is why he became a teacher if he feels so guilty about how he traumatized a child like Violet during the Great War. He even turned down the opportunity to see Violet again, indicating his determination to ‘help’ her and showcase how pathetic he is.<br />
<br />
Granted, if Gilbert had maintained that shallow facade of his, this would mean the beloved Violet Evergarden would learn how to move on from the man everyone presumed was dead and truly embrace her own growth as a human, rather than a killing machine like she thought she was. Gilbert is pathetic but the viewer should still give him a chance, right? Given all that’s happened, it would be extremely difficult to make a comeback. And guess what? There was certainly no comeback. In fact, all logic got tossed out the window for one of the most cliched, idealized endings I’ve seen. Once Violet finally develops enough to move on from Gilbert through her emotionally written letter to him, Gilbert has a change of heart after 4 whole years, abandoning everything he appeared so set in stone on and starts running towards Violet...Of course, Violet also noticed. Both swam towards one another for the dramatic finish. He decided to tell Violet “I LOVE YOU”. <br />
<br />
Now, given their presumed relationship as a father figure and daughter, this moment felt very off, because of the very romantic tone it sets off. Not only that, but the legend foreshadows at the beginning of the movie that Violet ‘disappears’ at age 18...what do you know? Violet is now legally an adult. Another note, in VE ep5, Violet actually is questioned by the 14 year old princess who is marrying a prince in his 20s about her thoughts on age gap relationships. What a coincidence! Violet and Gilbert were 14 and 29 back in the Great War. I wonder how that happened... Apparently, Violet had done ‘research’ and sees age gap relationships as perfectly normal, so for Violbert shippers, their wish has come true. Before anyone pulls the “No, you’re wrong because it’s a historical anime, so it’s okay!” card, there’s nothing historical about Violet Evergarden. Its setting is just a pre-technology era. Nothing is stated or implied this is a historical anime, because it also does not allude to any past events in the real world, so there’s no reason for the audience to give this relationship a pass. Regardless, it’s just straight up weird. <br />
<br />
Even in the prequel, Gilbert is very strange. Four years ago, he scolded Dietfried for violently hurting Violet who he acknowledged to be a child. Compound that with the fact that Gilbert can tell Violet is 14 by appearance (apparently), and you get a very different interpretation of Gilbert in past events...<br />
<br />
Back to the present, once the fated/cringeworthy reunion occurs, Violet abandons all her development she went through since the moment she was hospitalized and started learning the meaning of emotions because Gilbert came back. Given what the legend says, that means she and Gilbert started a new life together as a father and daughter? No, wouldn’t it be more romantic if they were lovers...as confirmed by the movie.<br />
<br />
This is so disappointing as a former fan of the prequel because it means none of Violet’s growth mattered in the end because of this overused garbage of an ending. Violet traveled across the lands, writing for so many people. She felt the hearts of those who suffered the loss of a loved one, helped those who couldn’t find the words they wanted to say, and empathized with those trying to move forward with their lives. Now it’s meaningless, because Gilbert is back! And this also ruined Yurith’s plotline which should’ve been its own movie as we see Violet finally make subtle expressions of emotions she never could have. Someone needs to say it and it’s going to be me. GILBERT WAS BETTER OFF DEAD. By establishing that Gilbert was dead before, Violet could learn how to live on from the loss of someone of significance and live life past that. Instead, Violet’s growth becomes one of the most unsatisfying emotional conclusions at the least opportune time with the most undeserving person in the series. If you think back of every Gilbert and Violet moment as romance, it just becomes comically bad. It’s every war drama except with moe.<br />
<br />
Violet was someone who never knew how to empathize with others and she began her journey to learn what “I love you” meant. That is why she became an Auto Memory Doll. Yes, it follows the “he was the first person ever kind to me” trope but it was still good. She learned how to love her friends and the people she worked with, while the Major was an inspiration for her to keep trekking this path. So it makes it all the worse when Violet&#039;s potential is trashed, which was what the entire anime series built up with her new relationships and job, only to run back to where she started. And she chooses such a trashy man to spend the rest of her life with.<br />
<br />
To be as impartial as possible, there are definitely some positives to point out. Visually, Violet Evergarden’s movie is a 10/10, with brilliant frames filled with details down from the little wrinkles in Violet’s dress to the glimmering waters in the ocean, it’s all spectacular. Despite all KyoAni has gone through, they were able to deliver perfectly on an artistic level. Surprisingly, animation actually is not as spectacular, because there are generally more dialogue moments with less frames focused on character movement like in the Violet Evergarden prequel. And unsurprisingly, the sound is still some of the best OST that anime has found in years. <br />
<br />
Another honorable mention is to the formerly disliked character, Dietfried. While this may not be much for everyone, Dietfried’s development was an unexpected surprise, but was truly well done, even if used for the wrong purpose. Dietfried went from an unlikeable a-hole to someone who tried to stop seeing Violet as a machine and actually helps Violet in her journey to move on. He was the secret supporter of Violet in this movie, meaning he acknowledged his cruel treatment in the past and a desire to redeem himself by making up for his actions. He even realized Violet was the bigger person in the end, rather than his once admirable brother, Gilbert, which indicates his positive change in perspective. However, Dietfried is also part of the reason for the cliched ending the movie had left off on, so unfortunately, his potential was wasted at the very last second.<br />
<br />
Finally, I would like to praise Yurith’s story for being some of the best of the VE series, because it heartfeltly captures the last moments of a young person struggling with finding the last words, last feelings, last goodbyes before the last moments of their life. We, the audience, see Violet empathize with Yurith as he tries to muster the words needed to express his own love for his friends and family. Violet’s feelings come across through slight smiles and generally normal reactions as she is no longer the traumatized kuudere/dandere she had faded out from. Yurith’s painful, yet relentless desire to reach out to everyone extends beyond letters as he pours everything out to reconnect with what he feared he had lost. At the very end of his life, he attains both the expression of love and closure he desired for his family and his friend in a sad, yet beautiful moment, concluding the most emotionally resonant story in the movie.<br />
<br />
Sadly, those are also the only remnants of a good story in the Violet Evergarden Movie. This review will certainly receive whiplash from other fans of VE, but please let me express one thing as well. VE was my first slice of life anime and I loved it. After rewatching, analyzing the writing and considering the sequel, I can say it makes me sad that I can’t look at the prequel the same. It really is something everyone should consider watching, but to have that experience taken away by a bad movie...it hurts…Maybe just like Gilbert should have disappeared, this movie will disappear from my memory, and I can truly move on and be happy~

    I could not believe my eyes.<br />

Kyoto Animation, you god. Violet Evergarden has always tried to entail one single story, Violet tries to find the meaning of love. In this movie, it reiterates this concept and pushes it to a whole new level. Humans have emotions, and so does Violet. Despite us being granted the power of feeling emotions, Violet does not. This beautifully crafted story of a somewhat coming-of-age romance film will go down as a classic in the future.<br />
<br />
To start, Violet Evergarden Movie took the risk of running 3 stories in one movie—Violet’s story, Yurith’s story, and the really minor one that started the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review366298">
        whole movie off and starts the whole plot off. But it blew all my expectations away when it skilfully blends everything naturally, like it just intertwines smoothly. Every minute of the movie tugs my heartstrings, and the critical moments of the movie just yanks on it. What can I say, it’s emotional, enchanting, and painful at the same time. Ironic right? Well, I guess that’s just how it is. <br />
<br />
As always, KyoAni never fails to continuously impress me with their extravagantly elegant art style and animation. With a perfect 3DCG and 2D blend too, the whole movie just pops out and stands out even among other high budget anime films. When it comes to making big projects such as films, cutting corners will really suck ass. But KyoAni took advantage of every frame and turned it into a glorious piece of art. You seriously cannot tell me there is nothing more unique than what Violet Evergarden brings in terms of art production. There is just no competition. <br />
<br />
Oh, the sounds of the orchestras and TRUE’s beautiful voice just comes back whenever I remind myself of Violet Evergarden’s incredible soundtracks. With the assist of amazing direction and careful placement, these soundtracks shined when it’s their turn to shine. May I just give extra credit to all the voice actors too, Ishikawa Yui does an amazing job in voice acting Violet and I would like to praise her for that.<br />
<br />
I especially loved the character development that went on in the 2 hours 20-minute runtime of the movie. We finally get to see both sides of the story, and both sides of the struggle between Violet and whoever the other man could be. There is so much I would like to say but I’m trying to keep it as spoiler-free as possible. To make it simple, we’ve had a really powerful character arc in terms of development and interaction.<br />
<br />
Overall, I loved the Violet Evergarden Movie. I love it even more than the original TV series. I love it so much that I’m about to go lower the scores of some of my highest rated anime just because 10/10 is not an accurate representation of the score I want to give this movie. It’s 11/10. You’ve heard my voice, now it’s your decision to catch this modern masterpiece that will not disappoint in execution. God, I’m still feeling empty inside…

    The movie finale of &quot;Violet Evergarden&quot; came along and destroyed everything I liked about the show in the first place...<br />
<br />
Back when it aired I called the original anime an &quot;Amazing masterpiece with gorgeous animation&quot; I; Watching it again... <br />
<br />
Yeah, It has gorgeous animation but neither the plot nor the characters were strong enough to call the series a masterpiece. Nonetheless, the two movies came along and destroyed everything that was at least decent of the original.<br />
<br />
Plot:<br />
<br />
The movie starts by trying to connect all the persons violet has helped out with her letters into one big net; using the granddaughter of the little girl of episode

          <span style="display: none;" id="review381574">
        10 for that and changing the parts of the narrative. The point of view of the future, and the point of view of the past. Sounds good on paper but the thing is that the whole concept is presented and paced awfully.<br />
<br />
 We don&#039;t spend too much time with the granddaughter&#039;s character for actually caring about her. She is a plot-device that has the function of receiving exposition and being a passive spectator of what is going on.<br />
<br />
Her dilemma with her parents, or why she chooses to abandon them even if she is underage is never really fleshed out or even explained; in fact, we don&#039;t even have the reasons why she did what she did. Then they try to make an emotional resolution with her but it simply does not work because we don&#039;t anything about her persona or the world surrounding her. The only thing I got was a spoiled brat that did everything only because of the sake of making a rebellious act.<br />
<br />
The reason for that is the fact that the movie doesn&#039;t know how to use her time. It forgot to passes from one point of view to another, making the whole movie basically about violet. What was the point of having the plot of the granddaughter in the first place? it didn&#039;t add anything up.<br />
<br />
Although, honestly, everything related to Violet is even worse. The first mistake was to retcon the destination of one of the dolls. She is now the apprentice of the writer Violet helped in the show and that was since the very of that episode. Although we have seen her character in all the episodes after that and in the movie sequel, they are contradicting the narrative. You could say is a minimum thing, but I give a shit, is a continuity mistake and I hate it.<br />
<br />
What followed is a huge letdown. Violet can&#039;t forget her beloved major and is having a difficult time adapting to the new technology and progress of society after the war, All of these were the themes of the original show, and that thing ended with Violet finally being of moving on, this is a character regression.<br />
<br />
Okay, the whole thing of &quot;Technology progressing, feeling old and things you were great doing now are obsolete&quot;  was a theme in the movie sequel and is a theme here; but saying the movie is doing something with it would be a huge lie. The show doesn&#039;t explore it and it doesn&#039;t give any conclusion to it, they only tell you &quot;Phones came, letters do not matter anymore&quot;.<br />
<br />
Another bullshit of the plot was revealing Gilbert was alive and trying to make him and his brother tragic characters. Big shock, they aren&#039;t. As much as the movie is trying to manipulate you into thinking their reunion was super emotional and deserved and that now Violet and the older brother of Gilbert have a nice friendship, the truth is this...<br />
<br />
Both of them are guilty of child abuse and war crimes and the movie has this disgusting double standard of taking as it were small mistake what they did. <br />
<br />
First of all, Gilbert being alive destroys almost all the character arc of Violet in the original show, second, he is as guilty as his brother. Violet is acting so happy about seeing him because he is with the person that loves her, but in reality, she is with the person that used a little girl for a war. Sure, he didn&#039;t bring her to the army, but he still used her.<br />
<br />
He could leave her in an orphanage, or in that big house he had, or maybe leave her with the family Evergarden way before, but nope, he used a little girl for war, used her as a presentation thingy, giving that little child many emotional traumas and mental illness. He is so coward that he can&#039;t face Violet.<br />
<br />
Yeah, the whole excuse of &quot;I gave her too much pain&quot; is bullshit, he is just too much of a disgusting pussy to face Violet because he knows he did a lot of unjustifiable shit; trying to make them tragic with a forced last-minute &quot;abusive-father&quot; backstory does not change everything up. <br />
<br />
In fact, in retrospect, I think the other country should have won. I mean, the country in which Violet lives forces street children to fight in wars, and the military is corrupted, what a great country to win a war.<br />
<br />
They try to force an anti-war message at the last minute, it came out of nowhere, and it did felt rushed. As for the rest, What else can I say?<br />
<br />
It is painfully overdramatic, the scene when Violet and the president of the company discover Gilbert is so cringy and out of proportion because the movie simply doesn&#039;t know the concept of &quot;Subtle Writing&quot;, the relationship is toxic and the finale is not really there. Nothing gets an actual conclusion.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t get into details about the animation and sounds since we all know looks great, is Kyoto Animation after all, but the insulting finale and the destruction of everything the original show was trying to build make everything else insignificant.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, this movie is an insult to the intelligence, a needless sequel, and an overdramatic piece of crap that promotes a problematic relationship.

    Have you ever watched something heart-moving and so breathtaking and saddening at the same time that you can’t pinpoint your emotions to any extent. Yeah, that’s what a slice of life anime does to you and this movie does that for you a complete supply of a touching story with a tint of drama and slice of life in it is already amazing. Violet Evergarden stands out as a gorgeous finale for the entire series, with such a compelling story and characters and scenes that move you to the core to the point that you can just sit back there and feel amazed and baffled

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388171">
        at the same point that is when you know that the show is touching your soul. The movie brings viewers up to rapidly with what emerged in the past while also canvases a stunning picture for the world of automatic dolls that can be used for both human tools and for war by the military to assist the lives affecting them properly and the lives of those around them.<br />
<br />
Story ~ 10<br />
Violet Evergarden is an orphan who’s been raised to be a rock-solid soldier and nothing more than a weapon to be yielded in war. Given as a gift to Major Gilbert, violet enters war at a young age. The stories in themselves are influential, which makes a big difference as it is all the more frustrating that it feels almost as if they are three individual episodes that have been put together. But ultimately, it is all but a minor complaint on my part as each tale can hit different emotional developments. The movie primarily follows Violet throughout the movie, giving all the viewers a grand idea of how this “Automatic Doll” is struggling and persevering to find herself while also discovering a path for the future.<br />
The only problem I had with all these stories that were put together that they were a sentimental story that I can’t handle as a person and every single part hits differently, and they feel as if they are incoherent from the others but they are not supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Animations ~ 10<br />
I have never in my whole time period of watching anime have ever doubted Kyoto Animation as it has always struck hard when it came to animations as it is considered to be one of the powerhouse studios of animations. The character&#039;s facial expressions and backgrounds for the environments popping on the screen. Violet Evergarden has everything going for it when it comes to its art style nobody can say otherwise. The graphics shown are crisp and flawless and silky, and the moviemaking is just artistic in its scene alterations. The scenes of the movie flow from scene to scene effortlessly and without any unforeseen changes that are meant to catch viewers off-guard. Furthermore, the anime’s demonstration of design is masterful like I’ve never seen in any mainstream anime before, capturing the emotions of the characters perfectly and displaying the tear-jerking moments fluidly this movie is definitely a slick one. Kyoto Animations does a phenomenal job to keep up to the expectations of the watchers with the likes of exquisite art style from series like Clannad, Full Metal Panic, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!, K-on and Haruhi Suzumiya, and many others that I’ve watched. Thank you Kyoto Animations for the astounding job that they did with the movie. <br />
<br />
Sound ~ 8<br />
I am not a big fan of the music in this anime but it’s a symphony that tells a tale about a sad story that has happened or is about to come which makes it even sadder to some extent. Composed by Karasawa, Miho, the song ‘WILL’ is strong and is catchy as well. While both the openings and endings have their own set of keys they portray standalone classical music pieces, often retaining the simple yet strong violin leads that are beautiful. <br />
<br />
Characters ~ 10<br />
For those who’ve not yet watched any of the contributions of the franchise, the so-called Violet was originally a warrior for her land, who afterward falls in love with her superior “Gilbert”. The movie mainly follows Violet during the course of the movie, giving all the viewers a brief view of the “Automatic Dolls” character who is not fit for the roles that she has been assigned, stressed, and determined to find herself while also determining a pathway for the imminent. We have our beautiful yet emotionally and tangible orphan person who’s just a mere tool for the upcoming war from a young age.  The young lady grows up to be slightly unemotional and seems to be passive without any love or affection for her.<br />
The main motivation of Violet is that she is always endeavoring to discover herself to find out who she is and what place does she hold in this world.<br />
<br />
Overall ~ 10<br />
The movie is an absolute spectacle showing how it is a love letter to the anime community and how it does a commendable and outstanding job of placing both its viewers and newcomers together to an absolute blast of emotions and a prodigious story-telling. Some may say it’s too depressing, some may say that they weren’t satisfied don’t listen, just watch it on your own you’ll own if the anime is stirring your feelings. Yet another story influenced by war and moved by people looks on how the world should be and the loss of their special ones in war. The execution is flawless and that it is actually one of the most compelling anime out there. It deeply moves viewers with its breathtaking visuals and cheeky emotional breakdowns that occur throughout the story. The imagination that this anime brings up is beyond belief and it takes you to inherit some types of feelings that cannot be comprehended.<br />
This is a mature anime that speaks to its audience about life and how complicated and tangled it is, yet how beautiful and painful and tragic it can be at the same time.<br />
Is it worth the watch?<br />
Absolutely.  <br />
<br />
<br />

    I cannot express the feelings I felt while watching this movie directly, so here I write a letter, in fact a review, to unfurl the mark this movie left on my soul.<br />
<br />
Let me tell you, straight off the bat, that Violet Evergarden isn&#039;t like one of those movies that boast a crappy, realistic and sad ending. It dared to bring forth the ending we all knew was impossible, but wished for deep within our hearts, and animated it with grand splendour. (Spoilers ahead)<br />
<br />
Run Gilbert run! One of the most satisfying moments of anime ever, was Gilbert, standing near the cliff, weeping after reading Violet&#039;s letter.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399357">
        His brother, who had treated Violet merely as a weapon, was now here, standing before Gilbert, for the sake of Violet. All the years he had wanted to thank him culminated into this beautiful moment, where he made Gilbert realise where his heart truly belonged, and made him race to the one who yearned most for him.<br />
<br />
The way the film started was indeed a very pleasant surprise. Relating it deeply with one of the most emotional and heart-touching episodes of the Violet Evergarden series, it couldn&#039;t have been handled in a better way.<br />
<br />
Life is fleeting for everyone, none spared. It lies within us how we spend the few precious moments with those we cherish. Violet Evergarden, captured this delicate perspective, and shepherded it to us in various ways.<br />
<br />
A boy, who loved and adored his family and one true friend, but had no idea how to convey it, in desparation, lobbed to the telephone and called the Postal Company, despite his weak body, for the sake of thanking everyone who had been there for him. With little money to spare, he was ready to give up all of it, so that they could keep a part of him after he had crossed Death&#039;s door. <br />
<br />
Gilbert, in the aftermath of the war, realised how many lives he had led to their doom, and eventually got crushed by the overbearing guilt, enduring and suffering it alone in solitude. He blamed himself for Violet losing her arms, and made himself responsible for all the suffering Violet went through. He distanced himself from everyone he cared for, thinking it was for the best. But alas! Destiny did not see it the same way. However far apart fate separated him from those he loved, destiny pulled them together again. Violet and Dietfried, together, showed him that he didn&#039;t have to face the burden all alone, that it could be shared, because that was what bonds were truly capable of.<br />
<br />
A young lady, feeling a deep resentment because they hadn&#039;t visited their grandparent more often, let out her frustration towards her parents, despite knowing that her argument was half-baked. Following the steps of Violet Evergarden, she realised the importance of bonds and what love really signifies. In order to apologise and let them know how she truly felt, she sent them a letter with just a few words, but infinite meaning. Those words were &quot;I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Capturing the essence of something so fragile and delicate- the concept of life and death itself, and animating it in such a way that it calls upon the very soul of the viewer, is candidly astonishing. Every scene from the beginning of the movie to the very end possessed great detail and precision. Kyoto animation really outdid themselves, and their passion that went into making the film was very evident. The vibrancy and life of every scene was stunning, beautifully drawn and animated to bring out the best.<br />
<br />
A splendid mixture of plot and sentiment, sprinkled with the right amount of comedy, animated down to the finest detail, is what I would summarise the Violet Evergarden movie in a few words. This was not just a film made to simply entertain, it was one which strove to make us realise what was important in life, and cherish moments that might never come by again.<br />

    As time passes, nothing stays the same. Familiar places become unfamiliar, and even people you have known for many years will change along with the passage of time. Violet Evergarden Movie masterfully explores this theme by following the life of its protagonist, Violet Evergarden. <br />
<br />
Story: The story is divided into three parts. The first part is about a girl, Daisy, trying to learn about Violet Evergarden. The second part is about a young boy, Yuris, asking Violet Evergarden to write letters for his family. The third part involves Violet Evergarden meeting Gilbert for the first time in years after their untimely departure. At first glance,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review366797">
        these parts seem unrelated. However, Violet Evergarden Movie seamlessly connects them to tell a story that is amazing beyond words can describe. It is the best storytelling I have ever seen. <br />
<br />
Art: After watching Violet Evergarden TV series and Violet Evergarden Gaiden, I was not sure how anything could surpass them in terms of the art quality and design. However, Violet Evergarden Movie exceeded my already unimaginably high expectation. Whether it is outdoors or indoors, every scene is breathtaking and a joy to watch. Violet Evergarden Movie sets the new standard for art design, and I do not think anything will be able to come close to it in quite some time. <br />
<br />
Sound: Violet Evergarden Movie’s sound design is nothing short of perfect. Evan Call did a phenomenal job again, and TRUE’s insert songs were amazing as always. Also, background music perfectly set the mood, and every sound effect was perfectly done. Simply put, it is the best sound design I have ever experienced.<br />
<br />
Character and Voice Acting: Characters are masterfully depicted and multifaceted. Violet Evergarden’s emotional moments brought many tears to my eyes, and Gilbert’s cold words made my heart stop for a bit. Voice acting was also stellar. Every voice actor did a phenomenal job, but Ishikawa Yui’s performance stood above everyone else. Her performance will be remembered as one of the greatest female performances of all time. <br />
<br />
Overall Enjoyment: I have watched the movie multiple times at the theater, and every time I am surprised at how good it is. I will probably watch it more at the theater and even more when the blu-ray is released. <br />
<br />
Conclusion: Violet Evergarden Movie is a peerless masterpiece that provides the perfect conclusion to the masterful Violet Evergarden series. It is a must-watch for everyone, and it is without a doubt the best anime movie I have ever watched. <br />

    Violet Evergarden: The Movie made me fall in love with anime all over again. This movie, and tv series, represent the best things about this medium. You could not ask for a better conclusion to a masterpiece. Thank you Kyoani.<br />
<br />
Back in early 2019, I went through the roughest period of my life. I was severely depressed after a horrible breakup and didn’t do much more than lay in bed all day. I hadn’t watched a new anime in over a decade because I thought anime was something I’d outgrown. One day, I decided to get back into the medium and finished up some older shows

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388337">
        that I had never completed. The masochist in me then decided that I wanted to go on a “sad anime” tour. I watched all the usual suspects, Clannad, Anohana, Kimisui, Koe no Katachi, Angel Beats, etc. I’ve gone on record before about how these series literally saved my life. But, one series in particular stuck with me in a profound way. Violet Evergarden. <br />
<br />
Violet’s journey of finding the meaning of love, acceptance of loss and grief was exactly what I needed at that point in life. Episode 10 in particular helped me with the lingering grief I had about my father’s passing. The masterfully crafted anime motivated me to check out the Light Novels, which I’ve now completely read, and the OVA. When I found out that a movie was coming out to wrap up the series I was beyond ecstatic. Knowing that the anime and LN differed in their approaches to Violet’s story made me really excited to see how Kyoani would close out Violet’s journey.<br />
<br />
Violet Evergarden: The Movie surpassed any and every expectation I could have ever hoped for. I knew Kyoani would bring the gorgeous visuals and animation, but the story that they crafted around Violet and the other characters was the most powerful they’ve ever done. Violet’s character development coming from not being able to understand what the word “love” meant, to being able to help others who are unable to express themselves is remarkable. She is fully able to empathise with people now. The movie was a satisfying resolution to her, the other dolls’ and a certain someone’s stories.<br />
<br />
“After all, all we have is the present” Such a simple line, yet it may be the most powerful that I’ve ever heard in an anime. Too often we take what we have for granted. We neglect to tell our parents and loved ones that we love them, or we say mean things to people we care about. Violet the anime and Violet the movie are all about taking full advantage of what you can do and say today to those you care about. Please. Don’t let those moments slip. <br />
<br />
Violet Evergarden:The Movie gets the easiest 10 I have ever given.

Im actually really fortunate to catch the movie in the cinema today. The whole presentation of the movie was just so beautiful. The art style and the details of everything in the movie was so well done. Kyoto animations really did a really good job drawing and animating this movie. I cannot stop talking about how pretty the art style is. The story itself did not fail to amaze me once again. I brawled my eyes out bruhhhh.

    I will write a simple review here, unlike the novels others write:<br />
<br />
Went to see the screening in theaters yesterday in the USA, and I absolutely loved it! The animation was breathtaking as expected, and it hits you in the feels multiple times. Bring tissues if you have a history of crying while watching Violet Evergarden. There are scenes in this movie that will get you hard. <br />
<br />
As a movie, it&#039;s really good, but I wouldn&#039;t recommend watching just this. You have to watch everything before because this movie brings back from stories from the TV series and ties those in very nicely, so you&#039;d be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388464">
        missing on a lot if you did not watch the entirety of the series beforehand. <br />
<br />
I am glad to see that they brought this story to a close in a very way as to not leave any room for imagination. I am not very fond of stories where authors leave it up to the reader/watcher to potentially come up with several endings and whatnot. Just end the thing, make it solid, whether the audience will like it or not. That&#039;s my $0.02 anyway... <br />
<br />
I am hoping it will come on Netflix soon as the previous movie did. This needs to be experienced on a large screen in 4k!

    Violet Evergarden: The Movie - SPOILER AHEAD<br />
<br />
These lines are being typed when I still have some warm tears lingering on my face, while playing the sentimental vocal soundtrack &quot;Mirai no Hito E&quot; from TRUE. I tried to remember when was the last time that I cried this much, feel this much, and had such an uprising unspoken shakiness that just waits to explode and erupt into the avalanche of emotions.<br />
<br />
Many films/movies that tug your string, many media products begging for your tears, spoon-feeding your pains and wrenching your hearts. Violet Garden: The Movie, however, slowly melts your heart away, makes you wish to cry and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388422">
        voluntarily succumb to the emotional weight, but as the same time heals your broken heart with powerful lines, and soothing undertone like a passionate ode.  It repeats this cycle until viewers realize that they have finished the roller-coaster ride of emotions and become a crying mess.<br />
What this movie does is to portray the narrative as the collection of three overlapping stories with the mixed bags of past, present and future. Together, they have formed an everlasting final tale of a former child soldier, an exquisite Doll, and more importantly, a finally true-to-be human girl known as Violet Evergarden.<br />
<br />
The first story is the framing medium fast forwarding to half of century in the future, and following Daisy. She is the granddaughter of Anne from TV series&#039; ep 10, who has lived her life to the fullest. Anne&#039;s passing has left a deep scar to Daisy, distancing herself from her parents.  However, upon finding the grandmother&#039;s treasure, 50 years worth of letters typed by a Doll, Anne sets on the journey to learn about this mysterious figure shaping the life of her beloved grandma.<br />
<br />
The second and the third story contain the larger chunk of the film length and have a close interconnection in reaching the endgame. They pull us back to the present, where we see Violet, Iris, Cattleya, Erica, Benedict, Hodgins, and the CH Postal Company in the midst of industrial and technological revolution. The invention of devices called telephone soon will make the ghostwriters, or the Dolls to become obsolete. The change is coming and forcing everyone else to make decisions in their crossways, to embrace the future that is thriving ahead. But Violet is facing dilemma of being unable to shake the pasts out of her mentality. Ghostwriting is what connects her to Major Gilbert. It becomes a new foundation for her to cling into will of living. Writing letters is what keep her intact against the post-trauma disorder, guilt and lack of reasons to keep up; so much that without it, what would be left for her? <br />
<br />
While everyone else is walking steadily through lives, Violet only has two things that matter to her, working and Gilbert. She visits his mother&#039;s graves, she reconciles with his brother Dietfried, and her eyes shine brightly upon finding Gilbert&#039;s belonging like a child finding the long-lost toys. She walks on the thin wire of emotional stance, which has been overcast by the sign of demise, knowing this would not be last for too long. Fortunately, as Violet is trying to cope with her burden, she met her new unexpected client, Yurith, a socially awkward young boy with an incurable disease; and surprisingly the new beacon of hope regarding whereabouts of Gilbert.<br />
 <br />
Throughout the 2/3 of the movie is the focus of Violet&#039;s quest to see Gilbert, commingled with her task of fulfilling the last wish of a soon-to-be-dead. Although they seem to be separate on the surface, these stories are intertwined where Yurith and Violet form a connection to realize the truly important things to convey their love to dearly beloveds they care about. The movie also explores the closer aspects of two brothers Gilbert and Dietfried, their past guilts and deep wounds of regret. For Dietfried, he loses a chance to profess how much he loved his long-lost brother. For Gilbert, he carries with him the physical and mental disabilities. He is disgusted with what he did to Violet. He regrets for making her hands tainted with countless lives and blood; and despite how much he cares for her, the inability to say &quot;I love you&quot; once more on their reunion would just carve another cut to his already damaged soul. On the other side, Yurith only wants to convey his love to his parents, baby brother, and his best friend, but is unable to do so with his pride and self-pity of his fate. <br />
<br />
When things are unfolded, stories are told and conflicts are resolved, all the pieces of the script are tied together and Violet Evergarden: The Movie follows a traditional conclusion with little of plot twists, and fairly predictable outcomes. But thou shall not jump to conclusion as a poor plot. It is the well execution of storytelling, rich sketch of universe, fluid transition between scenarios, and the perseverance of character&#039;s progression that make Violet Evergarden special.  And as the cream on the crop,  characters are manifested, animated and humanized that can be deeply relatable depending on our own experience. Story has an authenticity and a freshness that may drive our feeling through the crisis. It is &quot;genuine&quot;, to say the least.<br />
<br />
If all of those above are still not impressive enough, Violet Evergarden still has its signature move to tug at your heartstring. The vibrant visuals are not less than spectacular, astounding and unfathomable. Characters&#039; designs are carefully touched with dynamic facial expressions. The landscape and finishing backgrounds are polished whose every second can be still-shot work of pure art. The music is amazingly composed and well-timing that is soothing and sentimental, endeavoring and timely, and melancholic yet reassuring. The voice-over team outdid themselves, with souls and loves in dialogues. The peak of this harmony is evident transparently throughout the movie: from the faint smile of Yurith upon passing his last words, the rolling flashback of Anne, to the idyllic reunion under the moonlight. Seeing Violet bawls her tears out, continuously thumps herself to compress emotional explosion, and valiantly utter each spoken word, I have my utmost respect to KyoAni for such a well-drawn scene with the high complexity of mental state.<br />
<br />
The movie ties the knot with Daisy who concludes the telltale of the infamous Doll and her legacy. It shows the lasting power of words, that long after the writers, senders and recipients are dusted in the sand of time, still have the ability to change the lives. Yurith is a testament to written words, but also spoken works. Letters can touch the human heart, but so do the voice, the smile and tears, and any other shapes or medium forms. Gilbert is the final reminder in building the bridge from human to human.  A way to connect with each other still be there as long as we have the courage to show them.<br />
<br />
In the end, Violet Evergarden: The Movie is a fantastic closing chapter of Violet&#039;s journey. More than just her journey to find the meaning of &quot;love&quot;, it is also our own journey to remind ourselves what makes us, creatures with intelligence and self-awareness, become human. As an emotional experience with insightful view of the human condition through stages of lives and circumstances, it taught us the empathy - which how basic it may sound, is easy to be forgotten in these days and ages. <br />
<br />
“After all, all we have is the present&quot;. Mumbling this final movie quote while looking into the void, I just thought: What a good day to cry!

    A visual triumph for the beloved KyoAni team that sees the conclusion of one of my most heavily invested anime since I first discovered it. It&#039;s fair to say there was a lot riding on this film, not only to bring a resounding end for the anime&#039;s titular character but being the first film to be released after the devastating arson attack caries even more emotional weight for the creators and the eager fans wanting to see it. Regardless of my final opinion on Violet Evergarden: The Movie, I&#039;ve never been more thankful as an anime fan to see such passion and dedication put in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406477">
        by the team who worked on the film, which makes it so much harder for me to act as a critic in this situation.<br />
<br />
There is a lot that VE gets right straight out the gates: taking place shortly after the ending of &quot;Violet Evergarden Gaiden: Eien to Jidou Shuki Ningyou&quot; we are quickly brought up to date with previous characters of the show, establishing the critical change in time and technology after the war - a very interesting theme that serves as the main conflict/resolution of the film - and especially showing the character development of Violet up till this point. It&#039;s that last part where this film then proceeds on a downward spiral that in my opinion conflicts with everything KyoAni had set up with Violet up till this point. The writers of the show initially made a crucial change from it&#039;s respective source material, one that objectively did a much better job at establishing Violet as an independent character who had to face her own struggles separated from the only person she ever cared for.<br />
<br />
By the end of the show Violet was in a content place, she&#039;d lived past her previous life as a soldier, as Major Gilbert&#039;s weapon and had found resolution with his seeming demise. She had created a life for herself, one that Gilbert would have been happy for her. She&#039;d changed and shaped so many lives around her, from friends to enemies, playwrights and singers, daughters, sisters, and even old commanders. Along the way, she even came to understand what it meant to love, how to cherish it, how to express that feeling on the behalf of others, as well as the pain and heartbreak it causes. Come the ending however, all of that seems to have been wasted on our heroin and results in one of the most cliché confessions I&#039;ve ever seen, with a complete 180 for multiple characters development. That&#039;s the spoiler free version. <br />
<br />
One of the major areas this film struggles with is the pacing. I was overjoyed when I first learnt of the 2hr 20min run time, believing it would get the chance to show us in depth the extent of Violet&#039;s character as well as some of it&#039;s more notable side characters which we haven&#039;t had much development from. Instead though this film decides to go on the very slow burn, and while every frame may be beautiful...it also takes forever to go anywhere....and when we finally do get there, I couldn&#039;t help but feel disappointed. <br />
<br />
*MINOR SPOILERS*<br />
<br />
The film essentially has three ongoing plots: The first plot is set during the present time and focusses on Anne&#039;s (The daughter from episode 10) granddaughter as she finds out what happened to VE in her final days as an Auto Memories Doll. The second plot focusses on sick boy Yurith who Violet writes letters for as his dying wish. The third plot has Violet discovering that Major Gilbert is in fact still alive. To put it bluntly, none of these plots really have much in common with the others, as the first one has no impact on the main characters, the second one is wasted by Violet&#039;s final decision, and the last one is only really focussed on in the second half of the film. <br />
<br />
The first plot was certainly interesting if you are a fan of the world in which VE takes place, but really doesn&#039;t add to the theme of the film even though it tries. The second plot really feels more like a side story, which is strange considering the show has always been about discovering other people&#039;s stories and writing letters to convey their feelings. This is not to say that the film certainly doesn&#039;t lack emotion and even though I questioned Yurith&#039;s purpose in the film, I still couldn&#039;t help but tear up at his conclusion. Yet he doesn&#039;t get nearly as much development as other side characters we&#039;ve come across before, and therefor doesn&#039;t carry much weight on the story as a whole.<br />
<br />
*SPOILER END*<br />
<br />
Most of the time however is focussed on Violet remembering and reminiscing her life with the Major, only to find out that he&#039;s been hiding on an Island this whole time which once again brings up the same conflict she had half way through the show. It feels in every essence like the writers were going back on how they initially set up her character. We see some interesting points, like Gilbert wanting to bury his past in order to protect Violet from the pain she suffered. It&#039;s also here however that the film seems most conflicted with the message it&#039;s trying to convey, as everything the film sets up for these characters completely and suddenly chances by the end, with very little resolution on top. It&#039;s hard to tell if this was what the writers always intended from when they gave us that original open ending in the series but I&#039;d definitely take that conclusion over this one.<br />
<br />
Another area where I feel like this film falls behind is the music. I love the soundtrack for VE, and even here it&#039;s hard not to love the subtle notes than blend beautifully with the gorgeous imagery. However there is nothing here that is unique compared to what we&#039;ve heard before, no typewriter, no resounding scores, it&#039;s mostly the same melancholy tone that doesn&#039;t really change throughout the film. Everytime a letter was flying through the air, I just kept being reminded of the opening scene in the series and wished the music would catch up, but it never did. I also couldn&#039;t help but feel disappointed by the lack of resolution for the show&#039;s side characters: Claudia, Benedict, Cattleya, Luculia, and Iris just to name a few. None of them have any memorable moments, and even though we spend a lot of time with Claudia, I couldn&#039;t help but feel like the film missed a great opportunity with his character by the end. After all, he was the closest thing Violet had to a carer after Gilbert&#039;s departure. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a shame that for every moment this film get&#039;s right, it also takes two steps back. If the film had trusted it&#039;s audience and been just a bit braver to continue the journey it initially set up, this would have easily been great. It&#039;s not the resounding conclusion to Violet&#039;s story I was hoping for, but I take comfort in the knowledge that there are many fans who love KyoAni&#039;s work and especially love this film. I just wish I could have had that connection with Violet&#039;s story one last time. <br />

    2 and a half hours of non-stop bawling to the point where I had to literally went out to buy more water cus I felt like I was dehydrating, and another 2 and a half hours after coming home. <br />
You know, once in a while you will have a feeling that everything has peaked. Your brain would run out of stimulations, so you&#039;ll say to yourself &quot;Okay, maybe I&#039;ll lower my expectations a bit in order to keep enjoying things.&quot; but sadly it&#039;s just disappointment after disappointment. You have now fallen into a pit you don&#039;t know how to climb out, and eventually you won&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401172">
        even bother tryna do it.<br />
Then stuff like this just subtly shows up with snacks and climb into the pit with you. No flashy entrance, no overglorified introduction, you just start talking like best pals who have known each other for a long long time and lose yourself in the conversation. Before you realize it, you are sitting on the ground again, but they&#039;re gone. <br />
Time flies by, you&#039;ll be chilling somewhere and start to reminisce about the past. Strangely, the moment you&#039;d remember most is not when you were on the ground, but rather be like &quot;Man, that time under the pit was surely something.&quot; <br />
For that, KyoAni has done it again. <br />

    I think this is my first ever review that I have written, but I just couldn&#039;t ignore the urge to convey my emotions. <br />
I have finished the movie just two minutes ago. I don&#039;t think I have cried for two hours straight before. To be honest, I did not expect much, just because the ending was already kind of spoiled and obvious to me. Turns out, I underestimated the power of telling stories, art, and sounds. Every detail combined made the movie extremely emotional in the best way possible.<br />
The side story about a boy was absolutely beautiful and heartbreaking, the way of telling the story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399251">
        was also remarkable.<br />
To be honest, I did not really care about the future that was told with the memories of the young girl. It was okay I would say.<br />
Finally, the ending was really logical, but somehow still filled with so much love and warmth, that I just broke down completely, just like them.<br />
The story of Violet Evergarden will forever live in my heart and will always remind me to be open with my feelings towards my loved ones, as hard as it may be. I don&#039;t think I have enough power to watch this movie again, but I will be going back to the series from time to time in the future.<br />
Violet Evergarden to me is a gift and a lesson. It will never leave its place in my top favorites and I will miss it dearly! <br />
Thank you for everything.

    I do not usually write reviews for anime, but after seeing the Violet Evergarden film today here in Sydney, I just felt like I have to put a few words down regarding my own opinions and views of this amazing film I just witnessed. I remember leaving the cinema stunned and speechless, there are a few anime films that leave me with the same feeling of awe because of the depth and power of its artistic beauty and emotional depth. I can definitely state that the Violet Evergarden film – for me at least – is one of those rare anime films; like Princess Mononoke;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review366393">
        Grave of Fireflies; Ghost in the Shell and the Samurai X Trust and Betray OVAs that touched and moved me deeply while watching them for the first time, and maybe changed me forever after watching them.  <br />
<br />
WARNING SPOILERS BELOW<br />
<br />
                 What was it about the film though that moved and touched my heart so profoundly? Was it witnessing the emotional climax of Violet’s character development? Or was it the central message that the film was attempting to communicate to its viewers? And what was the underlying message of the film? was is it the timelessness and eternity of love? even though the moments of pure love that we experience are transient and fleeting like all the things we experience and witness in this world? Or is that the power of love to transform us forever for the better? And that without love we are all left feeling empty and adrift in the world? Or that heart-felt words communicated through words and letters forever leave a deep impact upon our souls, especially those letters written by those whom we love, like family and close friends? There truly was so much to absorb from the visual and audio spectacle of the film, but I believe that the underlying message of the Violet Ever Garden film – as symbolized with Violet’s painful longing and hopes to be reunited with the major again – was that what ultimately saves us from the abyss that we all will eventually fall into because of the unexpected tragedies and sufferings of human existence, is love. Whether that love we receive may be from a beloved – like in violet’s case with the Major – or love from various family’s members, like the love from a mother, sister, or son– all examples clearly and powerfully illustrated in both the Violet Ever Garden series and films. And this love needs to be communicated and expressed through words. The other message then is the power of words – which are vehicles for our deepest and secret emotions – to heal the wounds of past traumas and afflictions. Words of love from people who care for us and love us can heal our deep emotional wounds and ultimately save us from the darkness of the abyss that many of us can find ourselves helplessly trapped in because of various tragic and painful life circumstances forced upon us beyond our control and personal choice.<br />
<br />
                     Going in to the film, I was worried that the Violet Evergarden film would not live up to all the hype and expectations surrounding it. This is the first major work of animation produced by Kyoto animation after the tragedy they experienced last year. It’s amazing that after all that Kyo ani went through they were still able to deliver such a masterpiece. This film in my opinion is definitely one of their best works, and I have seen nearly everything made by Kyoani, this might be the best anime film they have produced up to now, maybe even better than A Silent Voice.  I can therefore state without any hesitations and doubt that this film lived up to all my expectations and more. You can feel that that movie was made with all the passion and love that Kyoani could give to it. I felt like one of the messages that the Kyo Ani production staff wanted to communicate to their viewers and fans after the tragedy of last year, was that Kyoani was back and wasn&#039;t going anywhere.  I can’t wait till this film is released next year on Bluray so that I can watch it again along with the series. Finally, we get a satisfying conclusion from Kyoani in regards to the beautiful spiritual and emotional journey of Violet’s attempt to discover the meaning and reality of Major Gilbert&#039;s words “I love you.” And I thoroughly enjoyed and cherished every moment of it. Thank you Kyoani. Violet Evergarden is now in my top 5 list of my favorite Kyoani works. Because of this film, I now rank the Violet Evergarden series and films higher than Clannad After Story, but ranked behind Hibike Euphonium and K-On!<br />
