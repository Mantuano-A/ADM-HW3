    EDIT: People, people. I went and saw this in a movie theater. In real life. Please stop asking me where you can download it, because I don&#039;t know. Thank you!<br />
<br />
As perfect as they were, I almost regret giving the other two movies tens, for now I have no numerical way of showing that this one is far superior to even them. Spoilers for those movies, obviously.<br />
<br />
Anyone who&#039;s seen the main Monogatari series can tell you that the difference between pre-Kizu Araragi and post-Kizu Araragi is like night and day. The question, though, is this: what happened in Kizu to change him so dramatically? There were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review237569">
        two catalysts: Hanekawa and Kissshot. In Nekketsu, we saw him learn the joy of true friendship when Hanekawa obstinately stuck by him where any sane human wouldn&#039;t have. In Reiketsu, we see the effect Kissshot had on him. This relied on buildup from the previous two movies - through them, the viewer and Araragi had to come to like Kissshot. But this is a review for Reiketsu, so I&#039;ll quickly move on to why that&#039;s important here and now. You know how Kizu has been devoid of the signature Araragi narration that pervades the main series? It comes back after a certain scene in this movie. My belief is that it&#039;s intended as a delineator between pre- and post-Kizu Araragi. &quot;This scene is where the transition was complete.&quot; I don&#039;t want to go into further detail because I don&#039;t want to force my interpretation on you, but the takeaway from this paragraph is this: Araragi&#039;s character arc in Kizu is very cleverly done, making use of both female leads, who themselves have character arcs.<br />
<br />
Readers of the book know that there&#039;s a very long talk scene in this movie (after the one I was just alluding to), meaning that Shaft has to pull out all their Monogatari tricks to keep the viewer&#039;s eyes open. And they do it well. The tone shifts at a moment&#039;s notice, with the OST and the animation style as its indicators, keeping it from becoming monotonous. The comedic timing was brilliant, enhancing jokes to be even more funny. The symbolism is cheesy and heavy-handed - to comedic effect. It was clear that Shaft knew they were being ridiculous with the symbolism in this scene.<br />
<br />
This has nothing to do with Shaft, but the juxtaposition of the two talk scenes (both of which I talked about, believe it or not) really is brilliant. It&#039;s like a modified Hero&#039;s Journey template that has two Audience with the Father sections. It raises the stakes for the Ultimate Boon section.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, let&#039;s talk about that, shall we? The fight scene in this movie was a lot longer and more action-packed than I remember it being in the novel. Frankly, it was amazing. Several parts of it were somehow silly and badass at the same time. The best part, though, was that we knew our characters. They were both unique, well-developed, and interesting. Think about - REALLY think about the climactic showdowns you&#039;ve seen and name one that fits all three of those criteria. Ain&#039;t easy, is it?<br />
<br />
But as any reader of the novel knows, the real climax of this story is the very, very end. Remember that legendary narration from the last few paragraphs of the novel? They kept it. Every last word. A huge number of factors make it so that the end of the fight scene isn&#039;t also the end of the movie&#039;s tension. Your socks will be blown off.<br />
<br />
After writing so much about this movie, it made me realize why I consider it so much better than the first two, though they were perfect too: out of the three Kizu installments, this is the one that feels most like a standalone movie. Its tone shifts multiple times, its pacing is extremely varied, and it feels like it has a proper climax. What was Tekketsu&#039;s climax? &quot;Pleasure doin&#039; business with you.&quot; It was hard to say that that movie was anything more than set-up (albeit very good set-up) for the next two. What was Nekketsu&#039;s climax? &quot;I&#039;m not a human anymore.&quot; The story was quite obviously nowhere near any satisfying endpoint, and we had two character arcs very openly unresolved. It was, again, hard to argue that it had merit as a standalone movie. These problems were borne of Aniplex&#039;s decision to cut Kizu into three, which is why they didn&#039;t affect my scores for the movies themselves, but it&#039;s worth noting why Reiketsu is so much better than Tekketsu and Nekketsu.<br />
<br />
Now that I&#039;ve talked at you for five friggin&#039; hours, I&#039;d like to end my review with this. Out of all the anime movies I&#039;ve seen here in Japan so far (Kimi no Na wa, KnK, Nekketsu, Planetarian, Kagerou Daze, AC...), this is the only one where I&#039;ve walked out of the theater and thought to myself, &quot;I want to see this again, right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, and there&#039;s no post-credits scene. Sorry! No &quot;Owari S2 soon&quot; or &quot;Musubi in stores now&quot; or anything.

    Kizumonogatari is 1 movie contrary to how it was marketed, distributed, and how mal has it entered into its database. So I will speak about the series as a whole.<br />
<br />
Kizumonogatari takes a cinematic approach on the well-established TV series the Monogatari series. This is truly a prequel that can only be appreciated when watching all of the series up towards Owarimonogatari. If you want Kizumonogatari in the chronological order you are watching anime wrong and the entire intention of the series is ruined. The foreshadowing is lost and you lose the bigger picture SHAFT tried to create for Nisio&#039;s work. <br />
<br />
But before going through Kizu

          <span style="display: none;" id="review245029">
        1 and 2 we are here on this page for Kizu 3. Kizu 3 was truly a wounded story. A story that doesn&#039;t end happy nor does it end conclusive. It&#039;s a prequel to the giant franchise therefore whatever happens at the end is only just the beginning. The story begins right where we left off. Arararararagi has collected the arms for Kiss Shot and is now going to see her full form. After some talks with Meme, we finally see her beautiful, bodacious, succulent body in all of her motherly, milf, glory. Truly a work of art. Fastword and we get to see the conflict arise. Ararararararararagi begins to realize that Kiss Shot in her full form is a danger to the human race. Internal conflict starts to brew within our young naive main character. Most of the middle part of the movie is focused on Hanekawa and Ararararararararararagi getting prepared to fight Kiss Shot. Of course, this wouldn&#039;t be the Gatari series without fanservice. And with some big ole&#039; titties, it&#039;s obvious that Hanekawa will motivate him with her body. So to summarize, the first half is Kiss Shot and Arararagi, Second half is Hanekawa. Now the final part is strictly a fight between the two. This fight goes on for a while but you never truly get bored. There are 10 different art styles and animation styles in this 1 fight that you never get bored. As I stated early, you will have so much fun with this. To be exact, this might be the best fight scene in all of the anime. Scratch that, might is underselling it. It is the best fight scene. Bless you, father Oishi, the series director of Bake and storyboard for Kizu. And we end with a great moment. But it&#039;s not a happy one. Everyone is equally miserable. But that&#039;s what true happiness is. Wait for that like communism. I digress. Ararararagi ends up not killing Kiss Shot and having her live her life feeding of him to live. Arararagi doesn&#039;t turn back into a human. And they will spend their lives worried about someone hunting them. <br />
<br />
So where do the first 2 movies play in this? The first movie serves as a way to introduce us back into the world. However, in a new world, Oishi constructed. The world where things are more avant grade. The world where internal monolog isn&#039;t needed. Exposition is replaced with visual storytelling. The second movie serves as the meat of the story. Showing us the best fights and the most interesting plot points. This movie serves as the concluding narrative to branch into the sequels. Sincerely, this is the best installment in the Gatari series. But to understand the lore more one must have watched everything that aired. I have to say, this is one of the best movies I have watched in my life. Thank you, Shaft, thank you, Oishi. God bless Japan.<br />
<br />
BUT WAIT THERES MORE. The ecchi scenes are amazing in this movie and so is the fight scenes. Hanekawa and Kiss Shot titties are a 10/10 alone. <br />

    (Minor spoilers/Rant in Enjoyment section)<br />
<br />
Kizumonogatari is back and at last we get the last piece of the puzzle, This time part three otherwise known as &quot;Reiketsu-hen&quot; or &quot;Cold Blood&quot;. The final chapters animated, just how well did it do?.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story 10 / 10<br />
<br />
We start the film at a brief conversation between the characters of Oshino Meme and Araragi Koyomi talking how it is unreal how Koyomi managed to overwhelm the hunters that were after his life and his master, Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade. <br />
<br />
The film progresses as we see a rampant return of the eloquence of visuals, symbolism and long chats that have left a mark on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252705">
        anime by the now known &quot;The Monogatari Series&quot;. Reiketsu unites the presence of Monogatari by displaying thought and process of our main character Araragi Koyomi and the familiar Monologues as we se how Araragi opens up his conscious and spills it right before all of us all and notice how he has changed. Reiketsu shows us how is it that Araragi came to be as characters and show the transition to us all by splitting up the process.<br />
<br />
As on Tekketsu, Kizumonogatari is Visceral as it appealed to human instinct of its rawness but also included a conversation oriented presentation that carried the first act.<br />
<br />
Nekketsu focused more on youth, The youth of our characters reminding us just how over their heads the main protagonist are, being Hanekawa Tsubasa and Araragi Koyomi. It imposed the rampant sexuality and the ego of our characters and it brought forth action to the table that greatly differs from the first act, Tekketsu.<br />
<br />
Reiketsu in the other hand combined all of that, and brought us the current formula of Monogatari as the last piece of the puzzle is unlocked and we get those ever so necessary inner monologues showing us the how! of how can someone who lives on being spontaneous and show us the results that it carry. It also shows us the result of forbidden knowledge, as the more you know, the less safer the world becomes.<br />
<br />
Reiketsu at large, It can be called the very beginning of the franchise of The Monogatari formula, it can also be the start of series itself but buried in all that, Reiketsu was the conclusion and acceptance to the end of ordinary lives that will from now on live knowing of the supernatural.<br />
<br />
Art 10 / 10<br />
<br />
Shaft really outdid themselves with this final arc, and brought us more fluidity we ever dreamt off to the screen surpassing the preceding films in the direction of visuals and their rawness, the combination of 3D CGI with  2D artistry of the highest caliber showcased on a eccentric but fully working presentation that the trilogy is. as well as honoring the culture of animation now that it has become a well define characteristic of the new culture of japan, that marvelously attracts new blood to japan enticed for the ever newer pile of contribution to society with impact on international scale.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound 10 / 10<br />
<br />
The sound direction was astounding, as it was the voice actors on their A game. followed by well composed OSTs and keeping the old school horror feel you&#039;d normally feel from Alfred Hitchcock, as many reference and use of direction clearly referenced the style and with new twist to the presentation of the film.<br />
<br />
Character 10 / 10<br />
<br />
Our characters, Oshino Meme, Araragi Koyomi, Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade and Finally Tsubasa Hanekawa were connected on highly unusual ways that your standard presentation, As their interaction feels timelined of progress aided by well directed visuals and ever accurate sound directions.<br />
<br />
Our characters are weaved on the thread of ignorance, youth and experience. weaving them differently but ultimately presenting us in split acts the coming together of a series and the buiding blocks of a character we&#039;ve enjoyed for years on the Monogatari franchise.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve waited for this for a long time, due to work I sadly missed this film while on theaters because of work. Know this though, any anger I held and all regret that plagued me as I patiently waited for clearly was worth every second now that I&#039;ve witnessed the final film.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a monogatari fan, I highly recommend it and if you&#039;re not give it a shot, For it is very possible you&#039;d be one of us and enjoy of the international harmony and fandom that surrounds The Monogatari Series<br />
<br />
However as much as  I loved the movies, If I was director I would have added and removed a couple of things. In comparison I liked the structure of Tekketsu. The Alfred Hitchcock direction references and the music with cold moments with well executed music.<br />
<br />
For example, instead of the dancing monks when Araragi returns from the convinience store to Kiss-Shot, I would reuse the animation just prior, where Kiss Shot in all her forms are running about in the garden of flowers, I would reuse that but change the background into a landscape of corpses and/or entrails. Adding some blood to the faces of the multiple kiss shots creating a better visual of Araragi Koyomi world view, the alternative would be to use the style of Onimonogatari painting like style but of old Europe showing vampires with human skulls since it&#039;s a European folklore, Given the use of French I&#039;m guessing Kiss-Shot is probably of French relativity . If used the first scenario with the landscapes I would put a stare similar to hanekawa just like how she looked right after passing out in front of ararsgi after being ripped open by episode&#039;s cross and place it in the multiple kiss-shots.<br />
<br />
I would add the same effect to Guillotine Cutter severed head, and remove the CGI because that&#039;s the only section where it doesn&#039;t really play well the CGI environment and 2D people is awesome but making Guillotine Cutter that way really steals from the punch araragi is supposed to feel.<br />
<br />
I would have also added on the beginning a little flashback in black on white, same style as tekketsu, when Oshino Meme first came In contact with Kiss Shot the legendary vampire and her power as a little background when Meme tells araragi when he took Kiss-Shots heart.<br />
<br />
Maybe that&#039;s just me, Absolute masterpiece of a trilogy nevertheless. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall Grade: 10

    I had the opportunity to view this film in theaters. This film exceeded my expectations. The previous 2 films were, unfortunately, unable to stand alone. Out of the two, this was the most action-packed and climactic. I was continuously blown away by the excellent sound direction and animation. Like most Shaft anime, the last Kizumonogatari film has an avant garde method of storytelling. It might seem strange, but it works for the tone and comedy of the anime. Random clips pop out and sometimes seem disjointed, however they only add to the amazing animation. There was one scene in particular that had everyone in the

        theater laughing due to its strangeness and eroticism. Overall, I highly recommend this film, although it may require getting used to the animation.

    Wow, really wow. All the Kizumonogatari movie are outstanding!<br />
Story is so well written (like the series) that 1h passes extremely fast.<br />
In these stories we see an important part of the whole monogatari series since it&#039;s mainly the beginning of the story between Shinobu and Araragi. I don&#039;t want of course to say more things about it.<br />
<br />
Except story which is a truly masterpiece, I have to admit that also drawings are<br />
perfect (10 it&#039;s not enough), physic of the body, CGI perfectly fits into everything, and damn Shinobu and Hanekawa are 2 gods came down on earth :O.<br />
<br />
 SPOILERS:<br />
<br />
The most beatiful part I think is reallt the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review380398">
        relationship between Shinobu and Araragi, which in my opinion is really well developed.<br />
Also Hanekawa is pretty interesting since we meet her in first movie.<br />
<br />
Shinobu and Hanekawa body movements are really well done XD.. Good Job!

    Note: my native language isn&#039;t English. Sorry for any grammar/spelling mistakes.<br />
Also: this is my opinion. Im not here to regulate thoughts or influence the way you look at this movie. If you loved it: great! More power to you. However, I would like you to remember that I also am entitled to having an opinion.<br />
Also: yes, I&#039;ve read the book and watched every part of the series till Owarimonogatari.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m planning on working this critique out a bit further sometime in the future, but for now, here is my critique of Kizumonogatari part 3.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
This movie tried too hard.<br />
<br />
As a mild fan of the Monogatari series (mainly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review253177">
        bake, Kizu 1 and the Nadeko arcs) This movie really disappoints. It tries too hard to be a work of art while also trying too hard to pander to the otaku crowd, coupled with being inconsistent with/to it&#039;s thematic messages/the rest of the series. This doesn&#039;t try to be a quirky/semi-serious movie like previous instillments in the series, and coupled with some weird directing choices I think that it hurts this movie overall, on a thematic and artistic level.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
While critiquing individual categories of this movie, I will try to bring to light my main problem with it.<br />
<br />
Starting with the:<br />
<br />
Art: The base animation and more experimental animation cuts were lovely. Stylistically, I liked this movie a lot. The varying styles/art design could&#039;ve been used a bit more tactfully, but in the end, they both were okay. The birth imagery and the visual callbacks to the other instalments in the series were interesting, but more on the imagery later. A more questionable addition was the idea of the non-chronological shots during this movie. I get what their trying to do with the idea of the unreliable narrator and the nuances between story and plot, but it was really hit or miss. It was a bit too overused.<br />
<br />
the imagery: in my opinion, it was mediocre.<br />
The shots constantly try to evoke underlying thematic deepness, which is unachievable with the:<br />
<br />
1. inconsistent tone throughout the movie (first being about the choice between humanity and vampirism, then about the worth of a human life, then about sex, etc. Stick to one theme. Meanwhile it also tried to be otaku-ish with the close to rape scene of Hanekawa which was played off like comedy and was drawn to look very sexual, obviously for bait , while also dangling the message in front of us that hunger is comparable to indulging into someone sexually. This isn&#039;t the original series where sexual imagery was just a thing, and the constant popping up of it conveyed the themes of puberty, hormones and sexuality.)<br />
<br />
2. wonky shot compositions (no film-school theory applied, except to the colour design)<br />
<br />
3. hyperactive (enological) cutting, and scenes that drag on for too long, which prevents a consistent theme from developing in a scene. <br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t The end of evangelion where the characters can actually support the imagery because of their realism; the characters in the Monogatari series are archetypes of harem anime; just a bit more developed ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, it wasn&#039;t all too bad, because it sometimes did the imagery well. A great example is the first scene, where the positions of Araragi and Oshino, the cutting, the shot of the hallway behind them, the lenght of the shots and the color design really complimented each other well to make an engaging, atmospheric, and thematic scene.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: good voice acting. Soundtrack was meh compared to the first and second movie, sound design was okay. Nothing special but not bad. <br />
A thing which irritated me a lot was the amount of dialogue; unlike the first and second movie, this one was very strong on dialogue. Why would you add in a lot of dialogue in a film? It doesn&#039;t add to the tone here, (In the original Bake it added to the quirkiness, which wasn&#039;t as apparent here as there.) and weakens the effect of the more strongly staged scenes/shots. There is no reason you should have any advantages watching this over reading this because of the amount of info-dumping and dialogue, unlike the first 2 movies. <br />
<br />
<br />
Character and story: this is a hard one. As I stated earlier, this movie tries too hard to be standalone and tries too hard to be part of the series. What do I mean by that? These movies try to develop their own, interesting narrative (which, is a decent one for the most part. Just poorly executed on every level.), while forgetting that it is:<br />
<br />
1. inconsistent with the series (all the character development here is completely thrown out of the window when entering bake, where only a few elements of this story matter. Why try to make a dramatic narrative out of it when it doesn&#039;t even add to the story? This is a big problem the Monogatari series has in general.)  <br />
<br />
2. doesn&#039;t awnser many questions in a satisfying or deep/new way. (what is the worth of a human life?, What is the food chain and how does it influence our way of thinking about each other? What is the effect of the male gaze on the perception of female power? The answers provided here, if at all, aren&#039;t new, particularly deep or special.)<br />
<br />
The character development was decent, for working out some archetypes in the harem genre. However, it suffers from the same fault as the story, with being inconsistent with the rest of the series. Again people, this isn&#039;t The end of evangelion, and in the end, these characters are meant as archetypes. Just some well-developed ones.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Final verdict:<br />
<br />
In the end, this movie is okay. This isn&#039;t a masterpiece, or a work of art in my opinion, but I just hate the attitude of this movie. It really, really wasn&#039;t my thing. I love the Monogatari series as a small, quirky series, but this really wasn&#039;t like that experience. And I know that my critique/score for the most part is very personal, but I&#039;m trying to bring some legit problems with this movie to light.<br />

This movie isn&#039;t as deep as it looks to be, because of meh craftsmanship or because everything that happens here, doesn&#039;t matter in the long run. Nisioisin isn&#039;t the next Shakespeare and I feel like people forget that in-between all the admittedly clever wordplay, In the end, he is an otaku, writing stories for otaku while being just being a bit above the norm. Same goes for the staff at studio Shaft. And I do not hate these peope! What I hate however, is the attitude of the fans towards non-fans, declaring them dumb for critiquing this/these movies for legit flaws, while not even looking into the thing that completely panders to their interest. Always look at something critically, don&#039;t buy into something blind.

    Kizumono 3 answered questions that surfaced in the first and second installments. It also lessened my disdain for some of the objectives that were displayed in the previous films, particularly in regard to Guillotinecutter and his crew. After one last major surprise, Kiss Shot is returned to her final form. Her attitude has reverted to that of her 8-10 year old incarnation in the first film; cheerful, carefree and seemingly generous. Of course, her impression will appear differently to others. this is only my opinion and I admit, I didn&#039;t care for her person in Nekketsu. Araragis growth as a vampire and as a young

          <span style="display: none;" id="review245189">
        man were impressive and I really enjoyed his conversations with Meme, even though they were brief. Araragis interactions with male characters seem more organic in contrast to his shiftiness around female cast members who, in this case, were Hanekawa and Kiss Shot. I can appreciate Araragis pursuit of justice and even his shyness. I did laugh at the perverted scenes, but they went on for longer than expected and became unconfortable. Despite the awkwardness, these scenes were far better executed than those in Nekketsu in which the nudity not only seemed out of place but stupid. <br />
<br />
Animation-wise, part 3 is probably the best of the trilogy. The freakin flashcards are at a minimum and the cgi or whatever looks less static than it did in part one. The color choices for this project were appropriate, conveying just enough intensity. I really enjoyed the eternal &quot;heat&quot; and haziness of the set. Kizumono def goes down on my list for best animated blood, it felt like i was watching calligraphy. There is a sensation about the style and effort of the animation that is more electrifying than the plot. This is problematic and I am in no way overlooking this error, but Reiketsu made better use of this device than part 1 and 2. <br />
<br />
To wrap up, I enjoyed Kizu and perhaps it was for the best that this chapter was broken up into 3 films. It still came off as a money grab (tickets weren&#039;t exactly cheap) but the big screen experience was worth the price. It was fairly unique and more entertaining than most of the television titles released in late 2015 through now - a condition that obviously impacted Kizu&#039;s reception, at least in the West. <br />
<br />
Kizumonogatari overall gets a 6/10. Reiketsu, 7/10.  <br />

    I&#039;m just gonna review all three Kizu movies here if you don&#039;t mind.<br />
<br />
Every so often I come upon a piece on entertainment where the public opinion differs a lot from my own. But after watching Kizu, I would have never imagined it would fall into this category.<br />
<br />
So yes, I think these movies are bad.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start with the animation, because it hurts the least. Kizu has the same abstract art approach as the rest of the series. However, there are two things that are different here. First, Kizu ditches the colorful look of the TV series for a more somber exterior. The palette is murky and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298216">
        generally less interesting. Second is the introduction of CGI. It was painfully obvious whenever it appeared, with a few achingly bad instances. E.g. a swinging severed human head, which looked so ridiculous I had a hard time understanding how it got into the final cut of the movie. There are some instances of brilliant 2D animation, but not enough to liven up the rest of the movie.<br />
<br />
The main issue I have with Kizu is the story. Specifically Hanekawa. The series has no problem portraying female characters whose sexuality is a natural part of their personality. Kanbaru and Senjogahara being at the top of the list. But they just can&#039;t seem to make it work with Hanekawa. She&#039;s either the big boobs klutz ready to indulge or the behind the scenes mastermind of whom all the big players are afraid of. I have no idea how these two could possibly mix. In the TV show she tends to fall mostly in the mastermind end of the spectrum, but in the movie they went all out in the big boobs department. And it hurts the character significantly when it&#039;s time for her to step up and say something enlightening. It&#039;s hard to take her seriously when her cleavage spends most of the screen time fighting back the force of gravity.<br />
<br />
Hanekawa&#039;s relationship with Araragi in this movie is even more confusing. At the beginning of Bake, their relationship can best be described as camaraderie with hints of it progressing towards something more. But by the end of Kizu, these characters are half a step away from a full blown romance. They have so little to do with their versions in the TV series, they might as well exist in another dimension.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Araragi, the movie doesn&#039;t feature his trademark inner monologues. Again, it only works to degrade the character. Without them, Araragi in Kizu is just your everyday edgy high schooler. The plot tries to be about him becoming less selfish and learning to interact with the people around him. However, there is no introduction to him being estranged from society in the first place and him changing to a better person is mostly supported by rather vapid interactions with Hanekawa. Most of Araragi in Kizu is just wish fulfillment: turn into a sexy vampire, crush all your enemies and get the girl in the end.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a bit here about how Araragi and Shinobu&#039;s relationship came to be. It&#039;s generally an interesting take on the formulaic vampire story, but is so cramped into the third movie it can barely be digested. Other than exposition, they have only one genuine conversation and then it&#039;s straight to the climax of the movie.<br />
<br />
Oshino mostly feels out of place. Kizu should have been the story about his introduction to the series, but Oshino only appears when it&#039;s time for some deus ex machina bullshit. There&#039;s nothing here about his past or motivations. The vampire hunters are not even worth mentioning. <br />
<br />
Kizu wouldn&#039;t be as bad if it were a standalone movie, but it&#039;s triple as bad by being a part of the Monogatari series. The TV show actually raises interesting questions about human interactions and, fuck it, even life. Kizu barely has a point to make and messages it does try to convey are so laughably simplistic it feels like it can&#039;t possible be part of the same series. It&#039;s only insulting to the fan base when something as vapid as Kizu comes along to carry the series&#039; flag.

    At the time of writing this Kizumonogatari III is one of only two Anime&#039;s that I have rated a 10. It is very rare that I rate anything a 10 because I don&#039;t believe any movie/show is perfect. And this is no exception, it isn&#039;t perfect. However, the roller coaster of emotions and the astounding journey I was unexpectedly taken on took my breath away. Everything all the way down to the ending credits song I thought was perfectly placed and fit the vibe of the movie really well.<br />
<br />
To anybody that knows nothing about the &quot;monogatari&quot; series, I highly recommend you to watch these three

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336987">
        movies first -as I did. I actually don&#039;t like the &quot;monogatari&quot; TV shows but I loved the 3-part movie.<br />
<br />
When I grade a piece of Art, I usually separate my rating into two categories: <br />
1) The technical achievement/production value.<br />
2) My personal enjoyment.<br />
Even if I don&#039;t personally enjoy a certain show or movie, I&#039;ll always give it a higher grade if category 1 is fulfilled.<br />
<br />
The 3 part movie starts off pretty average in-terms of story and characters, but since each were only 1 hour long, it kept my interest long enough to keep watching. As I got towards the end of the second movie I was hooked. The unique lens in which the director is telling this unusual story is very dream-like and excitingly chaotic. So despite the 3 part movie starting off slow (which I usually don&#039;t forgive and heavily criticise) once the movie gets into full speed it is something that is so unique it stands separate from any anime I&#039;ve ever seen. So from the view point of category 1, it achieves an 8 or 9.<br />
<br />
Now from an enjoyment point of view, as I said before, once it gets into full speed the momentum is so flawless it&#039;s almost palpable. It clearly draws heavy inspiration from french noir films and uses it to craft an action packed pessimistic romance adventure. When I use &quot;roller coaster&quot; to describe this film, I don&#039;t mean it in a &quot;it has high&#039;s and low&#039;s&quot;. I mean it in the sense that you can feel the momentum of this film pushing you forward right until the end credits roll. As an artist, I&#039;ve definitely been inspired by this movie. And to anybody reading, *this* is how you do &quot;romance&quot; correctly. &quot;Romance&quot; done right is not some soap-opera love triangle designed to create conflict... Done right, it is a gut feeling that pulls you were the director wants you to go.<br />
<br />
I could right a 5 page long review about all of the small and big things I liked, however, I usually like to keep my reviews short and straight to the point -only talking about aspects of the media that matters.

    While Part II showed the descent of Araragi into a vampire, Part III showed the descent of Araragi as a character. He oscillates between the comfort of being led and self pity without remorse. After frolicking about with the vampire in an extended montage, Araragi realizes that his rescue would be responsible for human deaths when she feeds, then resolves to commit suicide to make up for... absolutely nothing but self-satisfaction. Rather, he conflates his humanity (e.g. ethics) for his human life, thinking that somehow the utility scales would balance after he exits the scene. The pity-fest continues until the end of the movie, interrupted

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340057">
        only by a moment of thirst bait, in which Araragi realizes that his life amounts to dreaming about fondling breasts, and the show lets go of all pretenses to sell sex for an otherwise boring, tedious ride.<br />
<br />
If the goal is to stop vampires from feeding, Araragi never learns his lesson in the bittersweet ending -- although more sweet than bitter, since Araragi never resolves to any sacrifice, neither in his self-satisfying hypocrisy nor anything physical. He merely becomes a human being, as depicted in Bakemonogatari, that heals a bit faster. Boring, Hanekawa says. The frivolity cheapens the entire ordeal. There was nothing at stake in the trial; he only had to call Oshino for a get-out-of-jail-free card.<br />
<br />
There are rare moments in this part of Kizumonogatari where characters reveal their psychology through dialogue. For example, Araragi called his initial actions a romanticism that is beautiful but not correct. Heart-Under-Blade accused him of wanting to save anything weak, to which he fulfills once Oshino proposes the method for which would become perpetually weak. The revelations are refreshing, but like the confessions of a serial killer, still ghastly. Kizumonogatari glorifies codependent relationships, both between Araragi and Heart-Under-Blade, and Araragi and Hanekawa. They are all self-hating and rely on each other for cheap comforts. From the revealed context, the character actions make sense, but in the most pathetic way.<br />
<br />
In the end, this movie mirrors Rascal Does Not Dream of Dreaming Girl exactly in that they both feature an unremorseful asshole that never learns his lesson. They are both handed a golden plate with a winning lottery in their ending with no effort, and it&#039;s really, really disappointing. Since this is a prequel to the rest of the Monogatari series, it puts the entire series in an unfortunate context.<br />
<br />
The only saving grace is the metaphoric animation during an absurd fight sequence concluding with what could be an overzealous Nike commercial. Although even that is held beck by a glaring, almost comedic plot hole, in which vampires instantaneously reinvent themselves after being blown to bits, but arbitrarily get stuck as a child-like doll when the plot demands lolis.

    Kizumonogatari is back at it again with it&#039;s 3rd film and all I can say it was extraordinarily amazing. <br />
Spoiler Warning below*****<br />
<br />
Story 10/10 <br />
<br />
We start the film at a short discussion between the characters of Oshino Meme and Araragi Koyomi talking how it is incredible how Koyomi figured out how to overpower the trackers that were after his life and his lord, Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade. <br />
<br />
The film advances as we see a wild return of the expert articulation of visuals, imagery and long talks that have left a blemish on anime by the now known &quot;The Monogatari Series&quot;. Reiketsu joins the presence of Monogatari by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370354">
        showing thought and cycle of our fundamental character Araragi Koyomi and the recognizable Monologues as we se how Araragi opens up his cognizant and spills it just before us all and notice how he has changed. Reiketsu shows us how could it be that Araragi came to be as characters and show the progress to us all of us separating the cycle. <br />
<br />
As on Tekketsu, Kizumonogatari is Visceral as it spoke to human impulse of its crudeness yet in addition incorporated a discussion situated introduction that conveyed the main demonstration. <br />
<br />
Nekketsu zeroed in additional on youth, The young people of our characters reminding us exactly how over their heads the primary hero are, being Hanekawa Tsubasa and Araragi Koyomi. It forced the widespread sexuality and the inner self of our characters and it delivered activity to the table that incredibly contrasts from the primary demonstration, Tekketsu. <br />
<br />
Reiketsu in the other hand consolidated the entirety of that, and presented to us the current recipe of Monogatari as the last bit of the riddle is opened and we get those essential internal talks indicating us the how! of in what manner can somebody who lives on being unconstrained and show us the outcomes that it convey. It additionally shows us the aftereffect of illegal information, as the more you know, the less more secure the world becomes. <br />
<br />
Reiketsu everywhere, It can be known as the earliest reference point of the establishment of The Monogatari equation, it can likewise be simply the beginning of arrangement however covered in all that, Reiketsu was the end and acknowledgment to the furthest limit of customary day to day routines that will starting now and into the foreseeable future experience knowing about the powerful. <br />
<br />
Art -10/10 <br />
<br />
Shaft truly did something extraordinary for themselves with this last curve, and brought us greater smoothness we ever envisioned off to the screen outperforming the first movies toward visuals and their crudeness, the mix of 3D CGI with 2D aestheticness top notch displayed on a capricious however completely working introduction that the set of three is. just as respecting the way of life of activity since it has become a well characterize normal for the new culture of japan, that greatly draws in fresh blood to japan tempted for the ever more up to date heap of commitment to society with sway on worldwide scale. <br />
<br />
Sound - 10/10 <br />
<br />
The sound course was bewildering, as it was the voice entertainers on their A game. followed by all around formed OSTs and keeping the outdated repulsiveness feel you&#039;d typically feel from Alfred Hitchcock, the same number of reference and utilization of bearing plainly referred to the style and with new wind to the introduction of the film. <br />
<br />
Characters - 10/10 <br />
<br />
Our characters, Oshino Meme, Araragi Koyomi, Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade lastly Tsubasa Hanekawa were associated on exceptionally strange ways that your standard introduction, As their communication feels timelined of progress helped by very much coordinated visuals and ever exact sound headings. <br />
<br />
Our characters are weaved on the string of obliviousness, youth and experience. weaving them contrastingly at the end of the day introducing us in split acts the meeting up of an arrangement and the buiding squares of a character we&#039;ve delighted in for quite a long time on the Monogatari establishment.<br />
Enjoyment - 10/10 <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve sat tight for this for quite a while, because of work I unfortunately missed this film while on theaters in view of work. Know this however, any outrage I held and all lament that tormented me as I calmly hung tight for obviously merited each second since I&#039;ve seen the last film. <br />
<br />
In case you&#039;re a monogatari fan, I energetically suggest it and in case you&#039;re not try it out, For it is entirely conceivable you&#039;d be one of us and appreciate of the worldwide concordance and being a fan that encompasses The Monogatari Series.

    Ive seen monogatari series from the season 1 and all the movies and mini series/side arcs. Shaft doing really good job in making this series interesting if not for them i&#039;d definetely alrdy dropped this series long time ago, definetely will give 9 score to the main arc bakemonogatari and nisemonogatari and 7-8 score for some of the side arcs. <br />
<br />
This series feels really dragged already. and it basically have almost the same pattern for every arcs after bakemonogatari and nisemonogatari, things going down hill from there and boring for me, <br />
<br />
Araragi likes girls and surrounded by girls but seriously just go fuck hanekawa or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271105">
        senjougahara already, the series always have that kind of scene where araragi want to fondle breast or he is feeling horny and some scene with foreplay(but not actually doing anything) thats getting old and really dumb.<br />
<br />
In this movie he did it again we can see hanekawa running naked but without nipples and vagina so its not censored and they both do some bs foreplay but ended up not doing anything and suddenly after araragi sees hanekawa massive tits he somehow got massive spirit coming from nowhere to fight kiss shot and this kind of things have happened basically in almost every arcs, this series can be easily turned into the hentai series. I was laughing real hard watching this movie especially hanekawa parts where she become slut for araragi it isnt a serious thing anymore for me its been going on from season 1 until now.<br />
<br />
So basically the pattern is a new girl with big trouble is appearing-breakdown-horny phase-sudden enlightment-defeating enemies-adding a new girl to his harem. Well after seeing araragi so long i started to feel disgusted bcs he seems like something that the creator of this series wanted to become in his dope fantasy the guy who got backups in higher place which is pretty chicks except oshino and beats badass alpha male to save pretty chicks and save the day, its just become repetitive and the story isnt that interesting anymore, well with all the money he made from this series alone will be enough to fuck all the girls in his fantasy or even roleplaying. I started to get that thoughts in some of the recents monogatari series and thats disgusting. <br />
<br />
Ps: for any weird people out there who likes to jerk off with anime and likes harem bs bcs your life is miserable, this is just my opinion and save me from your bs and just scroll down if your fragile little heart is hurt and you feel like to debate this.

This is a review from a Monogatari Series fan, to Monogatari Series fans.<br />
Oh boy, how do I start? I will be fast: If you are asking yourself &quot;Shoud I watch Kizumonogatari?&quot; the answer is: YES, AND NOW!<br />
<br />
The first two movies were to introduce you the way everything happened. But now, at the third movie, you have one of the best screenplays and fights of the anime history. This is the movie with more fan-service in the world. You will be happy when you see what is awaiting for you. For Hanekawa fans: You will get one of the best scenes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252748">
        ever made. For Araragi fans: You will see how strong he was (even if you have watched Kizu II already, this has way more blood and action). For Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade fans: You will get to see the strongest vampire in the world at her full power.<br />
<br />
Let me start, Kizumonogatari has been one of the most antecipated anime ever. It was confirmed by Shaft back in 2010~2012. Millions of fans were awaiting to get the chance to watch this masterpiece, and they finally gotten, after 5 years. Thank you, Shinbou, thank you, Watanabe, Nisio, and everyone envolved with the production, you brought us a masterpiece. That&#039;s what this movie, the third part is.<br />
<br />
Story [10/10]: I don&#039;t need to explain you the story, if you are watching the third movie and the last series aired, you don&#039;t need some explanation. The novel &quot;Kizumonogatari&quot; being a movie was the best marketing, I can&#039;t deny. But it doesn&#039;t take you the quality you were expecting, it worth every single yen/dollar you paid.<br />
<br />
It was a great adaptation, with a lot of dialogue, just like the novel. Shaft always do a great job adaptating Monogatari Series. Nothing much to say about this point.<br />
<br />
Art [10/10]: Shinbou Akiyuki is for sure an ambitious man, his hability as director is unbelievable, this art style fit so well with the movie that made me cry (not for real). That&#039;s why I love Shaft, they always want to inovate. Every movement was tought to give you the best experience. It doesn&#039;t difere from the previous movies. This movie has more gore than I&#039;ve ever expected to see in my life. So here is the alert if you don&#039;t like these kind of things.<br />
<br />
Sound [9/10]: Great sound, even the small details aren&#039;t forgotten (when the &quot;camera&quot; changes for some high place you can hear a helicopter, that&#039;s amazing I think :v. I don&#039;t have so much to talk about the sound, just that the seiyuu(s) were acting great, like always.<br />
<br />
Character [10/10]: The Monogatari franchise is made of its characters and dialogues, the Characters here are so well done that you can see the way they were before the anime series. Hanekawa wasn&#039;t so charismatic, she is almost boring in the first movies, in this one we can see that she changes a lot during her journey. Even Kiss-Shot and Araragi also change during the whole movie, this is what amazed me.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment [10/10]: The hype almost killed me, one of the best anime movies I&#039;ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
Overall [10/10]: No regret, you should really watch it if you are a Monogatari fan. I&#039;m glad I am alive and had the opportunity to watch this movie.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading this review, I am not a native speaker, please forgive grammar or expression errors.

    This review contains spoilers! (sorry for the bad english tho)<br />
<br />
<br />
Kizumonogatari Nisio, isin&#039;s work is legitimately the best work of text and relationship development between characters I have ever seen. If you&#039;ve ever watched any anime from the monogatari franchise, you should know that the work is extremely unique; and here it is no different this feature chapter has my favorite characters in the work.<br />
     <br />
   The dialogues are extremely catchy and interesting, especially between Araragi and alias “Kiss Shot Acerola Orion Heart Under Blade”; which is intensified in the final struggle between the two which in my opinion is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417762">
        just AMAZING.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
   But of course everything it&#039;s not perfect , Hanekawa for example is turned into a walking ecchi for no reason. They just downgrade the character to a non personality anime tiddy girl. However i just ignore it because im a great fan of the series , but I would certainly reduce the note otherwise.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
   In general, my favorite chapter of the monogatari series and for sure one of the best text works ever witnessed, with some mistakes here and there, but what a relief for the plot and characters. Thank you Nisio, Isin for this excellent anime.

    Kizumonogatari III is good, but not as good as I was expecting. Kizumonogatari II is better by leaps and bounds, but Kizumonogatari III is better than Kizumonogatari I. <br />
<br />
Kizumonogatari III is a relatively average, plot-heavy arc from the Monogatari Series. It is similar in quality to the other Shinobu Arc, but it looks like Kizumonogatari. Speaking of which, it looks more like Kizumonogatari I than II, as in: it is also overly ridiculous and dramatized. <br />
<br />
Kizumonogatari III is very simple, making it hard to talk about. I enjoyed it, but I am underwhelmed by it after watching Kizumonogatari II. Don’t get me wrong, it is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315274">
        really good, just as good as any other Monogatari arc, but it is not Kizumongatari II quality. <br />
<br />
I don’t have much else to say. I am mildly stunned it didn’t blow my mind. It is rated higher than Kizumonogatari II so I had hope. I truly believed it would be better when I started watching, but now I feel like there is a black hole where those expectations were. I feel like I am missing the real Kizumonogatari III that is a masterpiece beyond all other Monogatari. But then I come to the nihilistic realization that this masterpiece doesn’t exist and never will. Truly tragic. <br />
<br />
That hopeless rant aside, Kizumonogatari III is still really good. We both know that if you watched Kizumonogatari I and II, you’re watching III regardless of what any review says. I’m also not telling you not to watch it, you totally should. Just don’t expect a masterpiece beyond Kizumonogatari II. <br />

    I did not expect to like this trilogy as much as I did.<br />
The Monogatari sereies always was one of my favorite anime series, but after watching this trilogy it has definitely ascended onto my top 3 favorite anime.<br />
<br />
I really liked how we got a closer look at the way Araragi used to think before the events of Bakemonogatari took place. He feels pathetic, at least compared to his righteous self that we get to see later on in the series. I like how we get to see a lot of Shinobu&#039;s Kiss-shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade forms a lot more. The &quot;ecchi&quot; scenes are top-notch. The animation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401775">
        is surprisingly fluid and clean, which really differentiates this trilogy from the rest of the series as the seasonal anime has more limited animation. The music is amazing, and many tracks like &quot;Bad Bully&quot; surprisingly fit with the intense fight scenes. There was a lot of gore in these movies, a wacky amount of gore. So if you don&#039;t really like seeing blood and the severing of limbs you should probably rethink about watching Kizumonogatari. The fight scenes were probably better than most fight scenes I&#039;ve seen in Shonen anime, which says a lot about the choreography and animation budget that went into this.<br />
<br />
I cannot say anything else than &quot;Why aren&#039;t you watching Kizumonogatari right now?&quot;<br />
I hope you found this review helpful.

 Kizumonogatari One and Two was really the base for this Three part series. Part One and Two explains the beginning of the relationship between Araragi and Kiss-Shot or aka Shinobu. Part one explains on how Araragi found Kiss-Shot injured with none of her limbs. He saved her thinking by giving up his own life, he hopes to reborn as a non-selfish person that is willing to help anyone without doubting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264856">
        and without being selfish. This is the backstory on how Araragi becomes a vampire and starts the relationship with Shinobu. This is the backbone of the whole Gatari series which foreshadows and connects to the MAIN series.  Part 2 shows Araragi have to fight three enemies to take back Shinobu&#039;s limbs back to regain his humanity. I would like to point out that part 2 action was amazing but simply felt a bit lacking since it felt its too short to be on its own. <br />
<br />
Part 3 is simply a masterpiece that really wraps this 3 part series of a movie. If you follow the order of the series and actually pay attention to the series, Part 3 foreshadows and connects to the main Gatari series line. You will see how SMART everything is planned ahead and how the story really amazingly connects like a straight line. You will need to have to watch Kizumonogatari before you can watch Owarimonogatari Season 2 in order to understand and see the connections. <br />
<br />
The fighting scenes in Part 3 is mind blowing. It&#039;s probably one of the best animated fighting scenes of all time. It&#039;s art style and how smoothly the animation is simply mind blowing. Every detail in every frame, you could tell that the studio really put effort into the animation. This is not your typical fighting scenes where it lack frames or lost in consistency of animation. Every frame in the fighting scene and the whole movie itself has perfect consistency in the animation and it&#039;s art. <br />
<br />
*Will contain spoilers now*<br />
<br />
The last 20 minutes of Part 3 is probably the best 20 minutes in the WHOLE MOVIE or even the WHOLE SERIES itself. Words can only go so far of explaining how beautiful it is. The last 20 minutes of the series really show strong character development and shows such painful but beautiful truthful emotions to the character. Shinobu wants to be released from the hell that is call immortality and want to die for someone&#039;s sake that she truly loves before that. Shinobu wanted to die for Araragi and regain his humanity. This is where Araragi selfishness comes in and didn&#039;t let her die. Araragi wouldn&#039;t let Shinobu die but made her to live even longer. Chaining her back to her cruel fate. Araragi is trying to be a savior but to Shinobu&#039;s eyes it&#039;s cruelty. Rending her useless but an empty shell that have to live only by his blood. Shinobu, no.. Kiss-shot is probably one of the most tragic yet but beautiful character in the whole Gatari series. The feeling of her humanity is stripped away from time and immortality and yet the person she wanted to die for his sake is making her live even longer. Tragic but beautiful. <br />
<br />
The writing is simply amazing. You can really tell that he really loved writing this series. The details, the foreshadowing, the clues, everything connects in a straight line. This has to be the best Gatari series of all time. <br />

<br />
It completely destroys and re-imagines the box into something unique and beautiful.<br />

It doesn&#039;t JUST have beautiful, high-budget animation... The actual ART......The visual &amp; auditory presentation is designed to get the viewer out of their comfort zone.<br />
The visual presentation is a direct compliment of the story&#039;s unorthodox narrative.<br />
<br />
The movie doesn&#039;t really fall into tropes or common generic overused storytelling tools...in fact, Kizu is the direct antithesis of ALL generic media. It takes what seems to be simple and glamorizes it with a mind-blowing, visionary flare.<br />
<br />
<br />
Great movies...outstanding pieces of art....unique.... must watch. <br />

    Kizmonogatari III finishes off the trilogy with a dramatic climax. I enjoyed Kizu I a lot, and the enjoyed Kizu II even more. I can safely say that I think the final piece of this story is on par with Kizu II for me. They were both well executed (although now I think I can admit that it was a bit rushed), and are both amazing films. <br />
<br />
This part of the Kizu story was not as focused on crazy fights as Kizu II, although it still has some good combat scenes. It&#039;s more dramatic, and goes for a more mellow tone, with a lot of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400667">
        the film being dialogue scenes in true Monogatari fashion. And these scenes are done well, grabbing my attention throughout the whole movie. The climactic fight scene was amazing, and a real highlight of the whole trilogy for me. I think they truly did a great job with this one.<br />
<br />
Its characters are obviously the same ones we&#039;d seen throughout the previous 2 movies. They are still the characters I loved, but Kizu III adds some extra development between Araragi and Kiss-shot, which is always a great thing, and really deepens my understanding and appreciation for these characters.<br />
<br />
Art and sound were also fantastic. Kizu III again has the unique camera shots that I&#039;ve come to know the Kizu trilogy for. It falls more in line with Kizu II, with the shots being used less, although much better executed. Other than that the art looks clean and the style is great.<br />
<br />
I give this a good score for my enjoyment as well. I&#039;ve pretty much already explained why in the previous parts of my review, so I won&#039;t go reiterating my points again for no reason. All I want to say is, I&#039;m glad I finished the Kizumonogatari trilogy and get get going with the rest of the series.

    First Review. Here goes nothing. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s been a while since a movie had me experiencing every type of emotions out there.<br />
<br />
Character development and Story: 10/10<br />
<br />
From the giddiness of the &quot;romantic&quot; scenes between our main protagonist and Hanekawa to the existential crisis posed by the dilemma of immortality, I can say for certain that these 3 movies, especially this one, achieved its goal of strengthening the characters from the main anime story line. The center piece to all of this was Araragi and his character development. By being imperfect and making *many* wrong decisions throughout the plot, the audience is far more likely to connect with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review253263">
        him on an emotional level. For example, his indecision when it came to picking a solution during the final conflict was a key element in showing that despite his &quot;vampiricism&quot; he&#039;s truly human at heart, for what human can have the resolve to make the righteous choice in that situation. A mediocre movie would have had everyone satisfied. Sadly, this is barely the case in reality and this movie portrays this fact brutally and accurately. <br />
<br />
Art and Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
The symbolic art and dramatic change in style from time to time fits perfectly with the detailed and beautiful animation throughout the movie and really keeps this masterpiece from becoming stale at any point. The music was also delivered perfectly and really enhanced the emotions intended behind each scene. <br />
<br />
Overall this movie really is one of a kind and really tells a wonderful, yet tragic, story.
