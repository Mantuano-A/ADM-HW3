    Its finally over. The story that I learned so many things from, the story which had a deep impression in my soul, my very silver soul.<br />
<br />
<br />
It was the best farewell imaginable.<br />
<br />
The art was top notch as it was shown in the trailers.<br />
<br />
The story was heartbreaking yet heartwarming at the same time. I don&#039;t think there will be another anime which engages me more than Gintama for the rest of my life.<br />
<br />
The characters of Gintama always seemed real to me more than any other anime. I laughed with them, I cried with them. like Gintoki, my soul has been colored by every one of them. They

          <span style="display: none;" id="review372190">
        left a very deep impression on me and I truly hold them dear not only in my heart but from the bottom of my soul.<br />
<br />
The sound and themes were awesome specially Wadachi as it somehow resonates with the whole story.<br />
<br />
To those who want to watch Gintama: start it right now. it is a slow burner but I am sure you won&#039;t regret it as you progress forward, seeing this beautiful yet cruel story.<br />
To think that it&#039;s over really brings tear to my eyes. It showed me desires, bonds and aspirations that I thought could never be shared through an anime.<br />
<br />
Thank you Hideaki Sorachi for creating some of my most precious memories <br />
Thank you for showing me what is the purest color of a person&#039;s soul <br />

    To be honest, i&#039;m disappointed.<br />
<br />
Ah, Gintama, you used to be great a long time ago, what happened? &quot;The Final&quot; symbolizes the fall from grace of an once amazing series, that started losing steam along with its self-awareness.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll go straight to the point: My main complaint about this movie (which also applies to the second half of Gintama as a whole) is that it deviates from what made it actually interesting on first place. Making fun of most anime tropes through witty parodies and non-stop references? Nah, let&#039;s became one of the things we used to laugh at (a standard, uninteresting battle shounen) instead. How ironic.<br />
<br />
As

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409331">
        such, &quot;The Final&quot; ends up carrying the flaws that marked the second half of the story: a generic and over the top &quot;lets-save-the-world&quot; plot filled with some of the most cheesy dialogue i&#039;ve ever heard. Jesus, a good chunk of these one-liners made me physically cringe. It was a faithful adaptation, that&#039;s for sure; but when the only thing that&#039;s left is a half-baked mess, there&#039;s not too much to do.<br />
<br />
A comedy show like this could&#039;ve done way better with a less &quot;epic&quot;, more open ending. Before that, it should have tried to tie up some of the plotholes that were left (like Gintoki&#039;s past, which was incredibly left aside) on a less pompous manner. You know, some short but probably better written arc on the vein of Yoshiwara and Benizakura. Yeah, those were the good ol&#039; days. But it seems like Sorachi got a bit too ambitious and things went out of hand.<br />
<br />
And i don&#039;t usually complain about production values, but i&#039;d be lying if i said this movie wasn&#039;t lackluster in that aspect. The animation was so incredibly cheap and clunky. And the close-ups and transitions... at times i felt like i was watching some kind of cheap soap opera. In retrospective, it made appreciate a bit more these episodes which consted of a single frame with a lot of dialogue; at least that was more creative, funny and sincere.<br />
<br />
Gintama was an anime on which i invested a considerable amount of time, and has been with me since the last year of highschool. It easily became one of my favorites, and i ended up getting attached to the majority of the cast. I repeat: as a fan, i&#039;m disappointed. 4/10, with an extra point because of the opening and the post-credits scenes, which were more faithful to the true soul of the series.

    This movie has everything that makes a classic Gintama: parody, toilet humor, drama, sword action, tears and blood, top notch DOES song, self deprecating humor and jokes that piss off Japan’s PTA. <br />
<br />
It managed to utilize such a large ensemble of characters incredibly well, although some had only time for a cameo. We laughed and we cried and we laughed again... (I’ve only ever heard the audience laugh this loud in the previous Gintama movie!)<br />
<br />
The animation was beautiful, although you could tell where they saved on the budget as it wasn’t always so even, but it has a very unique touch to it when the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review372588">
        budget is on. <br />
<br />
This movie has heart, and more importantly it has SOUL.<br />
<br />
And IF they don’t troll us again and it’s really the final Gintama, it’s an awe and some way to leave. <br />

    Story 9<br />
It was a great blend of drama and comedy as always. I would say that the parody scenes of a particular anime at the beginning was fucking epic and hilarious. Those madlads in the studio pulled it off. Anyways, it was a great conclusion to the anime. I am really happy I was able to see it in the theaters. For the manga readers who know the conclusion of the story, there are bonus scenes that don’t exist in the manga. You should check them out.<br />
<br />
Art 8<br />
The art quality was great and it might have been the best it ever was throughout the series.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review372172">
        There are news that the manga author Sorachi himself drew some of the key animations. Sadly I wasn’t able to tell which ones they were. But I have to say the animation was fluid and beautiful for every scene.<br />
<br />
Sound 8<br />
The soundtrack was great. In one scene, the music was loud and had too much noise but I guess maybe it could’ve been because of where I was sitting in the theater. Except the new songs from Spyair and DOES, most of the songs were the traditional soundtracks you have probably heard before.<br />
<br />
Bonus<br />
When you go see the movie, you can get one of the character drawings of Demon Slayer drawn by Sorachi. I got the Shinobu one, and it was pretty cool. For the lucky Gintama fans living in Japan, if you haven’t received one yet, go get them now!<br />
<br />

    「 This review would be for the entire series of Gintama 」<br />
<br />
Before I start this review, first of all, I want to say thank you to the mastermind of this anime. Sorachi, no, Gorilla-sensei, from the bottom of my heart, just, Thank you so much.<br />
<br />
Gintama, what is Gintama? <br />
<br />
Gintama is not bad, its not good, its not great, its not a masterpiece, its nothing else except Gintama. I would not dare to use masterpiece for this anime because that means I would just be categorizing it with the other shows, when clearly it shouldn’t.<br />
<br />
If other shows have made me laugh, and enjoy. Gintama gave me

          <span style="display: none;" id="review374327">
        a sort of happiness that I just couldn’t find in other anime. <br />
<br />
The plot isn’t “become a pirate king” or “defeat the demon king” “become the number 1 hero” isn’t like that at all. Instead of using the summaries present, I’ll give you my own summary. Gintama is all about protecting those close to them, and what makes that WORK, is the gem of the series, the heart of the series.<br />
<br />
The characters<br />
<br />
Each and every character, their personality, their relationships, their banter, everything, is what this made just so special. From Kagura and Gintoki’s sweet fatherly relationship, to Gintoki’s and Hijkata’s weird love hate relationship, to Otae’s role as everyones vulnerable big sister, to Kondo’s kind heart. This characters, woven with their perks, strengths and flaws, is the heart of the series and what makes it so great.<br />
<br />
And this relationships with everyone, would later let you come to understand the protagonist himself, Gintoki, and would also become something special for the viewer as well, and that includes me.<br />
<br />
Like I said earlier, I didn’t just enjoy Gintama, it didn’t just entertain me, it made me happy.<br />
<br />
The key core to Gintama, its interactions and relationships with the characters is what made it super special for me. It felt warm, it made me happy, through small episodes, like for example, stand alone Kagura centered episodes made me feel warm, it made me get this giddy feeling that I get whenever I hang out with my friends. <br />
<br />
It felt like it was real, it feels like I was connected to the characters somehow. <br />
<br />
As a gintama fan, I always see complaints of how long it is, well I don’t blame them really, but I think the episodic nature will later become the core of each major arcs, that would later make you understand why, why that everyday life was so important. Through those mini comedy arcs, to its stands alone episodes, you get to connect with everyone and their relationships.<br />
<br />
Those connections, with their everyday life, became so important, to the story, to the characters, to probably the author, and most importantly, to me. <br />
<br />
Gintama is a painting that looks overrated in the surface, but is in fact a treasure in the pile of Gold. With each characters being the paint, major arcs being the brush strokes, and Sorachi as the artist himself. When combined together, it shines brighter than any gold in existence, a work that was made with deadly long years.<br />
<br />
Gintama was a pretty, beautiful, bright silver.<br />
<br />
It made me realize how beautiful life is, I’m not sad, I’m not depressed or anything, I’m just a person who enjoys watching anime who just so happens stumble across Gintama. But despite my normality, it made me enjoy life a little more.<br />
<br />
I think this is what Gintama the “anime” for me. It made me enjoy life, it made me appreciate it even more, something that I couldn’t get from others.<br />
<br />
The anime that made me laugh, cry, angry, scared and more, but most importantly, it really did made me happy.<br />
<br />
I’m not making you to watch this anime, Gintama isn’t for everybody after all, and I’m also sorry if this review is all over the place. But I just wanted to convey to everyone what Gintama is for me, and what makes it so special.<br />
<br />
Let me say my final words before I cry into the abyss while writing this.<br />
<br />
Gintama, from the bottom of my heart, truly.<br />
Thank you.<br />

    I wasn’t planning to watch this movie, since I only bothered with a dozen episodes, a few clips, and didn’t like any of them. But then a friend of mine who is a huge fan and has been following Gintama religiously insisted on watching it together. I was going for Fast &amp; Furious 9, but he said ‘that is a stupid movie of a franchise that overstayed its welcome’. Unlike this smart movie which is not part of a franchise that overstayed its welcome. I mean, if it’s the second best anime of all times according to MAL (at the time of posting this) and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411501">
        the Gintama entries take up half of the top 20 in general it can only mean it’s a masterpiece according to the majority. And the majority is never wrong. So I watched the movie and I hated it and I wasn’t planning to make an overview about it, but then I found a Reddit topic where someone insisted that if Gintama isn’t in your top 10 it means you either didn’t watch it or you dropped it early on. Especially if you watched a lot of anime. It triggered me enough to write this text. Thus it’s not my fault, it’s his fault.<br />
<br />
So the movie starts by trying to fool you into thinking it’s going to be serious, since aliens invaded earth and everyone is about to die. And then anime references appear that have nothing to do with the plot, ruin the seriousness, point out the lack of creativity Gintama has, and how it would never be popular if it wasn’t taking advantage of other popular titles. I know what you’re about to say. But Snob, Gintama was always doing that so it makes sense to keep doing that, if you don’t like it. Such a bold claim from the fans who agree that they didn’t like Gintama until they watched 150 episodes. No show that demands from you to watch 150 episodes before you start liking anime references can be considered great.<br />
<br />
Also a movie should be good by itself, regardless of not watching everything that came before it. Well, this movie sucked ass in terms of pacing. It had a ton of flashbacks to stuff that you already know from the series, and even if you don’t know because you didn’t watch the show, the flashbacks were so many, so long, and interrupted the plot so often to the point you didn’t give a shit. My friend who is a diehard fan of Gintama, was playing a Dragonball gatcha game during the flashbacks because he got bored of them.<br />
<br />
When the plot was not interrupted by flashbacks, there was a lot of action, which wasn’t good at all. Remember when I said I wanted to watch Fast &amp; Furious 9 instead of this movie? Well I watched it the next day and what did you know, it was the exact same thing in terms of action. Dozens of bad guys shooting, multiple explosions and crashes and beatings, and none of the good guys ever got hurt. It was impossible to take it seriously. And I know that many of you are going to say, I didn’t watch enough episodes to get used to the action being like that. The fights were always that improbable and if you had watched 500 episodes, you would like them. No, I wouldn’t. I would hate them every single time, because they can’t be taken seriously despite the show desperately trying to come off as serious in those scenes.<br />
<br />
There is a scene where a dog shits out old men, who turn out to be Gintoki’s legs, so the dog needs to eat them and then puke them so they can combine. This thing happened in the middle of a serious battle. My diehard Gintama friend was eyerolling. The final duel has the bad guy slashing and punching Gintoki a hundred times. He lost 10 gallons of blood and every bone in his body broke. 10 seconds later he was perfectly fine. What kind of a final battle is this? The same shit was happening all the time in Mortadello and Filemon, another movie I watched weeks ago and it was brilliant there, because it never tried to take itself seriously. There was never any tonal whiplash, since it always had the same comedic tone. Gintama is the definition of tonal whiplash and anyone who insists it’s amazing for instantly switching from tragedy to comedy is an idiot.<br />
<br />
Then the battle ends and I have no idea what happened. Something-something mind control, something-something multiple personalities, something-something I regret being a bad guy who wanted to kill everyone so let me magically fix everything and you can all forgive me. What a load of bullshit. Gintama should have stayed as nothing more than a plotless rip off of popular shonen instead of trying to have a dramatic plot. Everyone will tell you the same, diehard fans included.<br />
<br />
And then it gets worse. The movie goes on to show the aftermath of the story and how every character got his closure. Or better say, didn’t. Because it’s basically the same joke a dozen times. They tell you this character changed completely later on, only to be proven it was a troll and absolutely nothing changed. 500 episodes, a dozen movies and a gazzilion adventures later we got zero plot progression, zero character development and zero story closure. Everything ended exactly as it began. Where’s this amazing story all the fanboys kept talking about? ‘Gintama is not just references and toilet humor, it also has an amazing plot’. How is that possible when nothing changed in the entirety of the series?<br />
<br />
And it doesn’t even stop there; the end credit scene shows the mangaka self inserting as a gorilla and telling the audience that he didn’t want to give closure to anyone so the fans can speculate anything they want about them. What a genius. Why bother thinking of an ending when the fans are going to make one for you? Less effort, more praise. And that was the end of Gintama. A movie I see nobody’s talking about, regarding a series that nobody cares about for a long time now.

    This is not Gintama. I mean, it has the same story arc and the same characters, but overall it felt like another parody sketch, overextended by mistake. The animation style is probably the main culprit. Then the action, pacing, story, soundtrack. When it was over, I was left with a feeling of &quot;Wait, is that it? Where&#039;s the real final?&quot;. <br />
Animation style aside, it felt like this was just a hastily put single story arc finale, made by a different studio, rather than a proper Gintama finale. I mean, every time I saw these generic &quot;anime eyes&quot;, I was like w t f. All the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408670">
        presentation aspects of it are different from how it usually was in Gintama. And those aspects, for me, were one of the defining parts of what was Gintama as a show. <br />
So overall, 2 silver balls out of 11.

    Gintama finally making it&#039;s final chapter after so many fakes in theatres. This movie really was the ending the entire series deserved. It covers the final manga chapters and the story outlives the ending of the Silver Soul Arc. The story ended as it should be, the whole series had the over all goal for the characters to live their daily lives having fun jokes and gags as going on adventures together, as their pasts come to haunt them sometimes even literally. In one finale all the lovable characters come back once again to take down the one last obstacle from them living their lives.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373309">
        Seeing the final scene will get any long term fan of the series extremely emotional. The animation too was extremely promising and the best from the entire series, it really shows what animation in the year 2021 could look like for most anime. Enjoyment isn&#039;t a 10 because some of the jokes were a miss personally to me but Gintama always has the same lovable comedy it&#039;s had since the beginning. I think that this was one of the most bitter-sweet ending to an anime that I have ever seen.

    &quot;I cried, I laugh, and then I cried laughing.&quot;<br />
This movie can be easily summed up to that.<br />
<br />
This movie is very special for me, as it is the ending to my favorite anime of all time. Also, as this will be my first and final review for Gintama. So, this review would ultimately also be my love letter for Gintama and Sorachi.<br />
<br />
Let me start by reviewing the story. Anyone who watched Gintama already knows what it&#039;s all about so I won&#039;t touched upon it too much. All I can say is this movie is divided into two parts. Three if you count the first part, which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408669">
        is the recap of the Silver Soul Arc. But ultimately, it&#039;s just two parts. The first part is the continuation of the Semi-Final OVA as well as the ending to Otsuro and the amanto who invaded the Earth. The second part is all about the closure of the series, bringing the characters&#039; arcs to its proper conclusion. As well as Best Girl Tama as the main focus. This is perfect because the movie&#039;s length is the right amount to fully encapsulate the stories that this movie&#039;s trying to tell us. Because of that, the pacing is absolute perfection. There&#039;s just the right amount of everything. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s move on to the characters. I don&#039;t really need to say anything about the characters because each and every one of them are worthy to be a main character in different series. That&#039;s how great the characters are in Gintama. But regarding this movie, the characters are handled quite well. They gave enough spotlight to the characters that needed them (a.k.a. the main cast). The characters here doesn&#039;t need development because they are already well-developed characters. All this anime needed is to put the story to a closure, which it already did perfectly.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk about the animation now. Well, spoiler alert, they already made a joke about this topic in the movie itself (though in the manga, the joke was about the Gorilla), about how the animators were shackled in the TV broadcast, and now in the movie, they could show to the audience that we were not dealing with the average animators anymore. See, they have finally realized the legend. The legend that we fear. They became the Legendary Super Animators.<br />
Enough about joking, all you need to know is the animation is worthy of being called &quot;movie-quality&quot;. Though it is not in the same leagues as Ufotable, Sunrise, or KyoAni, it had the right amount of crisp and it is a feast to the eyes when the fights are happening.<br />
<br />
Now lastly to the music department. It fucking slaps. It all had the tracks from the previous seasons, as well as new banger tracks to add to the list of Gintama&#039;s already legendary OSTs. The theme song and the insert songs are also quite the banger.<br />
<br />
Overall, this movie is the perfect ending to Gintama. I avoided spoiling as much as I really want people to watch this masterpiece for themselves. If this review isn&#039;t enough to get you watching Gintama, then... any other review out there will, probably lmao

    Gintama The Final finished. Oh boy what a disappointing ending. Here are my final thoughts and review. Again it&#039;s my thoughts. I will be going over both this movie and the series. This is my first review so here we go.<br />
 <br />
Characters<br />
It&#039;s no doubt that Gintama has one of the best cast if not the best. And with females, they put them to good use. I don&#039;t think I need to go long on this because characters are something I would say Gintama does the best with. You love them and appreciate them as you go on with your watch and in the final movie,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review413389">
        they were as good as usual. Would say the cast is peak. But the final villain being trash stops it from reaching a 10.<br />
<br />
Rating:9<br />
<br />
Story<br />
This is where the issues start. Think of one of those cartoon movies of a bad guy taking over the world for whatever bs reason and the main cast has to stop them. The story of this movie. As generic as it gets<br />
Gintama&#039;s story arc overall has usually been good. Serious or none serious. SSA is the conclusion to SS which I would say is the weakest part of the series. Silver soul part 1 was just bad. It took me some time to let it sink in because of my love for Gintama but honestly, it&#039;s dead, forgettable, boring, and is a cheap adaption. 2006 Gintama ironically looks better. And for The Final honestly, the story and conclusion was mediocre. It had its comedic reference at the start which I liked. We also got that alluring scene with Katsura Gintoki and Takasugi and Shoya which was nice. But from the hype this movie got, it was such a letdown. Utsuro being the final villain is the first issue. He was an uninteresting final villain with such boring reasoning to why he is doing what he is doing with the im going to destroy the world plan. I don&#039;t mind villains with no motives or wack motives if they have other things that make them intriguing. Utsuro lacked that for me. Just felt like one of the generic villains I&#039;ve seen in movies that want to destroy the world. And the plot of this movie was the students stopping him from doing that. Story-wise it was mediocre. And for a series like Gintama I would say it was not a good conclusion at all.It has no hype at all and no peaks close to Shogun Assassination and I don&#039;t think Gintoki vs utsuro is close to 305.Gintoki vs Utsuro was not a good final fight mainly because I couldn&#039;t care for Utsuro and of course, I knew how it would turn out. I would give the story for SSA story a 5. As its own thing, it was meh but as the conclusion of the Gintama franchise, it was disappointing.<br />

Art and Animation <br />
It&#039;s not a question the art style improved. But the art style was just not it. They made it more modernized, soft, and polished. I&#039;m typically not a fan of this art style and a few examples are DXD s4 animation change and What kid naruto looks like in boruto vs og naruto. But it&#039;s something that is just personal taste. Definitely prefer the old art style. The animation was alright. Don&#039;t have much to say. Gintoki vs utsuro had a few great animated scenes. Gintama was never something to have crazy animation so it was nice to see. But for a movie, the animation as a whole was below average.<br />

The sound was fine nothing much to say. I Liked a lot of the new songs. New ost was fine, but I wished we got more of the old ost. It would bring more feels into it in my opinion.<br />

Few things I want to address<br />
With the fact that I really didn&#039;t enjoy this movie much all the flaws that Gintama had made it worse. <br />
-Starting around ss part 1 they started doing a lot of these cringe one-liners when a character appears and it just hurts as much as seeing Nagatoro saying sus. <br />
-Another thing about Gintama is they don&#039;t really kill characters. Killing characters doesn&#039;t decide if a show is good or not but I just don&#039;t feel danger for the characters and feeling danger is what they try to do. I mean it&#039;s a battle shounen. <br />
-They keep trying to do these scenes where they try to make you think the good guy got hurt or killed or whatever but do a quick twist and either someone comes in or it&#039;s clutched. After how many countless times it happens it&#039;s obvious its plot is convenient.<br />
-I&#039;ve seen so many fatal stabbings and it&#039;s as if in the Gintama verse you can&#039;t run out of blood. Literally. With all the stab wounds some of these characters got you would think they at least get some lifetime injury. I&#039;m aware it does not have to be realistic but I&#039;ve never seen a shounen exaggerate it as much as Gintama. It&#039;s to the point where during this movie when one of the characters gets stabbed in a fatal spot I don&#039;t worry because it&#039;s equivalent to getting a paper cut. Like if they are going to make a character seem like they have a serious wound at least follow up with it. As long as you are a good guy you are immortal in this show except for a few unlucky ones.<br />
 These are some of the flaws Gintama started having later on in the show but with the love and enjoyment I had, I didn&#039;t mind them but now that I didn&#039;t enjoy ss1 and Gintama The Final these flaws just annoyed me.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
Didn&#039;t really enjoy, unfortunately. No peaks or hype. Maybe if they put a crazy budget it could save it. Just maybe. This is one of the worst final battles I&#039;ve seen. Having a 4/10 final villain is probably the issue.<br />
<br />
Rating:4<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
As I already said, this conclusion movie was a disappointment. This review might seem like I dislike Gintama but I enjoyed the majority of the series. I was looking forward to this movie but, I just was disappointed with the outcome. Gintama went from making fun of anime tropes to becoming them ironically which brought ss as a whole down. I wouldn&#039;t mind it going that generic route if it did it well but obviously it didnt. With the way, Gintama makes you fall in love, i&#039;m sure many will overlook the issues this movie had. As a whole, though I confidently can say I am grateful for starting this series. It was such a fun ride while it lasted but this movie doesn&#039;t feel like the same Gintama I fell in love with. I would have been better off stopping at s5 than getting a bland generic shounen movie.<br />

    I have been a true fan of Gintama, but this movie I would say was a big disappointment. <br />
<br />
To be very honest, this movie wasn&#039;t needed. <br />
The anime had ended quite well with the story. of course, the story did not end with the anime, but another episode or two would have ended the show well enough.<br />
<br />
I got goosebumps in the beginning while the childhood scene of gintoki was being played, but that&#039;s it. The movie does not live up to the expectations, well but I did not expect anything from the movie in the first place..<br />
All the residents of kabukichi coming back to join

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410485">
        hands, now this had become pretty repetative.<br />
<br />
I am a big gintama fan and it will always be my favorite anime, but this was just a filler episode. nothing else.

    I usually don&#039;t write reviews for movies but after seeing this movie a wave of emotions came after me and I realized that if i don&#039;t spend 50-60 hours writing and editing a multi-paragraph review on this movie my life will never be the same. This is the greatest movie of all time, a cultural revolution, a bringer of renaissance in the shounen genre, and an intellectual masterpiece of the modern era. As a Gintama fan, let me explain why. <br />
<br />
PLOT: <br />
<br />
Deep plot. Gintoki and his friends team to defeat the big bad villain and save the world on an epic, grand scale. After a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415051">
        few seconds of swords clashing and clanging, the plot ends, roll credits. If you haven’t seen Naruto Shippuden before, this was a very creative and original direction the movie took. Many plot twists, plot reveals, and plot devices that will shock you to your core. Move aside Gintama S4, this movie is the new king.  <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: <br />
<br />
Emotional, interesting, and funny. The excellent writing of these characters in previous seasons was put to such good use in this innovative, groundbreaking save the world plot. Touching flashback used in the beginning in case you forgot who the characters were, very thoughtful of Bandai Namco. Unfortunately, after the flashback ended, I had difficulties remembering the characters, so they should’ve sprinkled more flashbacks throughout the movie to help the fans out with memory issues. Very surprising twists done with the characters as well that you would not see coming a mile away in your standard shounen with excellent foreshadowing to back it up. <br />
<br />
ART &amp; ANIMATION: <br />
<br />
Easily surpasses ep 19 of demon slayer. Massive improvement from S2-S4. No discrepancies in character design or animation present at all during the entire movie. Personally, I wish a little CGI was used because the smooth animation was eerily human. The direction in the final fight and the final fight in general made more sense than a Pre-K class. If this final fight was a person, it could easily explain college-level math to a toddler. The choreography and direction of fights in general was better than ever before. The new artstyle fits perfectly and is leagues better than the old one. 	<br />
<br />
SOUND: <br />
<br />
Wadachi by SPYAIR and Douraku Shinjou by DOES made me fully erect, 10/10 there. Sadly, the final fight had a little too many sound effects and music tracks playing. My ear canals have never felt so overstimulated in my life than when I was listening to that final fight. If you want to go through an enactment of a freight train crashing into your living room, I would strongly recommend watching the final fight because that’s what it sounded like. Hopefully the Blu Ray release cuts down on the amount of sound used. <br />
<br />
COMEDY: <br />
<br />
This movie is comedic on many levels. One of the most ingenious jokes in the movie was the mangaka self-inserting himself as a gorilla and saying he is too lazy to write the backstory of an important main character amongst other things he didn&#039;t feel including in the conclusion, and it was beautiful. This man Sorachi made millions off of openly admitting he won’t cover plot holes because he didn’t feel like it, and he got his movie to the #1 spot on MAL, which is probably the funniest part about this movie by far. You will never experience comedy like this ever again. Whatever you think is impossible, this movie makes it possible, like a true shounen. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: <br />
<br />
Sorachi made me a masochist. <br />
<br />
RECOMMENDATIONS:<br />
<br />
Shounen anime with friendship, never giving up, and saving the world. Sadly, there aren&#039;t too many of those out there. <br />
<br />
To sum up, this was definitely worth the 7+ month wait and completely delivered the hype as a Gintama fan. 7/10 only because Gintoki did not kiss Takasugi once in the movie. The chemistry was there, Sorachi, you should’ve gone for it. One thing I definitely agree with the other 10/10 reviews is that this movie will put you to tears, and I gotta say, many of the plot decisions done by Sorachi in this movie did that to me.<br />
<br />
TLDR: Sorachi straight up trolled his audience in this movie and got away with it. This the greatest ending of all time. <br />
<br />
If you made it this far then hopefully you can tell there is sarcasm present because this movie was a little disappointing imo. This movie is everything Gintama would’ve parodied back in its’ S1-S4 days aside from the comedy and insert songs. If you like the movie, that is great, I’m just putting my perspective in as a Gintama fan disappointed with the direction Sorachi took. Thanks for reading. <br />

    This is my first review so please bare with me.  I felt obligated to write for the conclusion to my favourite anime, especially considering my feelings toward this movie adaptation.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start off by saying that I&#039;m not very impressed. I read the conclusion to the manga as it was being released so I already knew what to expect from this movie plot-wise, and as a result, I was able to focus a bit more on the anime exclusive parts of the movie, such as the art and sound design.<br />
<br />
Story: <br />
The story is loyal to the manga, which is a huge relief. I was worried

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408747">
        that this arc wouldn&#039;t fit into the length of a movie and that they&#039;d have to remove or change important content in order to keep it reasonable, but I suppose that&#039;s probably why there were two semi-final episodes. In spite of this, I still found the pacing to be a little strange at times. While I knew that this arc was supposed to be a more serious conclusion piece, it still included the comic relief scenes that Gintama is so well known for. Unfortunately, the transitions between the serious moments and funny moments didn&#039;t feel very smooth, and a lot of the humour fell flat in a way it rarely ever did in the rest of the series. There were a couple moments that didn&#039;t feel as emotional or impactful as they did in the manga, which is a shame considering this is supposed to be the big dramatic climax of the series.<br />
<br />
Art: <br />
This was one of the most off-putting parts of the movie for me. It had the same art style as the semi-finals, which is to say that the colouring in particular was distinctly different from the rest of the series. This comes down to personal taste in the end, but I&#039;m not a fan of how soft and airbrushed the character shading is. I found myself missing how the cast used to look in all their lazy cell-shaded glory. As for the animation, I was expecting a bit more. I found that several of the fight scenes looked awkward or slow, and in the end, I just never really felt like there was much of a climax because of how underwhelming they were.<br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
This was one of my biggest issues with the movie. I&#039;ll start off by saying that the insert songs by DOES and SPYAIR were great. They suit Gintama as well as the two bands&#039; music always have, and the new songs this time around are real bangers as usual. Definitely my favourite part when it comes to the sound in this movie. Unfortunately, the rest was disappointing. <br />
<br />
When it comes to the soundtrack, I was hoping for a huge nostalgia trip, but what I got was mostly soundtracks I couldn&#039;t recognise to the point I thought the movie had a completely original OST separate from the rest of the series, save for one or two tracks later in. If the songs I didn&#039;t recognise were from the anime, they picked probably the most bland tracks they possibly could have. If I had the choice, I would have replaced them with some of the much more classic soundtracks that any fan would recognise in a heartbeat. There are plenty to choose from, and among these are definitely songs that would have fit the mood just as well, if not better than the boring ones that were selected instead. The emotional impact would have skyrocketed.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack isn&#039;t even my biggest complaint about the sound design still. What bothered me the most was just... how dead quiet it was most of the time. For a movie where there&#039;s constant battle going on all throughout this giant crumbling structure, there was virtually no background noise for the vast majority of the movie. There was no ambience. If I had been blindfolded watching it, I wouldn&#039;t understand what was going on- not because I don&#039;t understand Japanese, but because there was the distinct lack of blades clashing and bullets bouncing and metal creaking and breaking and explosions echoing. There was nothing to relay the sounds of combat anywhere except wherever the characters of focus were. There wasn&#039;t even background music during a lot of these instances. This led to a lot of silence and little emotional investment. I didn&#039;t feel stimulated at all.<br />
<br />
Final thoughts: <br />
To summarize my thoughts on the movie in a few words: This isn&#039;t Gintama. It doesn&#039;t look, sound, or feel the way Gintama should. It was more boring to me than even some of the less popular stand alone episodes. It just didn&#039;t have enough energy or tension. In the end, I still thought it was okay, almost purely for the fact that the story was written by Sorachi and the art was still in the original style, save for the weird colouring. The characters kept their personalities and it was nice to see the series end on a positive, humourous note. <br />
<br />
My favourite part of the movie, in all honestly, was the ending theme song. Wadachi is a good song to end on, and what I particularly loved about it was that the animation for it featured references to many of the other ending theme songs right from the beginning of the series all the way to the end. That was the kind of nostalgia and emotional response I was hoping to get from the rest of the movie. It was very cute, and I now find myself wanting to go back and continue my rewatch.<br />
<br />
Despite my less than great impression of this movie, I&#039;m both happy and sad to see this series end. It will probably remain my favourite anime, as I&#039;ve yet to find anything that satisfies my brand of humour as well as Gintama does. It turned some of the worst moments of my life into some of the best, to the point that I&#039;m actually grateful for having such a horrible time, otherwise I never would have picked up the series again. <br />
<br />
Thank you for all the years of laughing and crying, Gintama. Farewell!

    Gintama never fail to surprise the fans, it will always have a special place in our hearts.<br />
<br />
In the introduction, The movie was successful in presenting the heart and soul of the Gintama concepts. I think it was a great start for the movie, and it is my most favorite part.<br />
<br />
The movie presented everything you could expect of Gintama, all the cool fights, funny acts, crazy parts, sad stories, happy moments... etc. Mostly, our favorite Sakata Gentoki was a start like always, and other favorite characters. <br />
<br />
However, the movie failed at some point in the graphics, and it&#039;s not that much of a great issue. In

          <span style="display: none;" id="review374073">

    I don&#039;t know anything else to say. When I originally started watching Gintama, I was so into trying to take it seriously because that&#039;s what I do with shonen. Blindly going into it knowing it&#039;ll be funny yet feeling underwhelmed I felt was expected. I took a break and one day I was bored and decided to just sit down with an open mind and binge it. Feeling free of burden, I enjoyed everything. Every episode got better and I always smiled every single time I clicked on an episode. I laughed, I cried, I loved the entire cast. I felt sad when I finished

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408940">
        it and realized they had a movie coming to finish the series. Now that I was finally able to watch this Movie, I don&#039;t know what to say. It&#039;s over I guess. I loved every minute of it. It never failed to get me interested into the world or characters. It was a masterpiece. This movie had passion and love poured into it by the animators. Beautiful animation and a perfect wrap up for the silver soul arc. Everything that happened was perfect and it surely wouldn&#039;t disappoint. It&#039;s Gintama doing it&#039;s very best. Giving you more Gintama even if it&#039;s the last of the series and giving a send off to the viewers. A FINAL goodbye. <br />
If you&#039;re someone that doesn&#039;t know if Gintama is worth watching, it&#039;s up to you. It is what I would say, the definition of &quot;acquired taste&quot;. But if you plan on watching it, I&#039;ll let you know now, as a fan, it was one hell of a ride.

    WARNING: THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE ENTIRE GINTAMA SERIES!<br />
<br />
<br />
I started watching Gintama in a dark period of my life, i was feeling lonely and i was a bit overwhelmed by my look and had several insecurities that initally got turned into an severe cronic depression. That was until, of course i met this silver haired man who ran a odd jobs with his two best friends. I got introduced to Gintama, when i was looking for something to make me laugh, make me feel something and when i stumbled upon a really stupid penis joke from gintama, i knew this was going to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417746">
        one of the favorites but i never would&#039;ve guessed the impact it would have on me. Gintama changed my life as a whole, made me a better person, made me understand how to interact with people, made me learn how to love someone/something properly but most importantly Gintama made me who i am. So let&#039;s talk about what may possibly be one of my favorite pieces of fiction.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
At the beginning, Gintama may seem like a plotless silly comedy series, almost remiscent of an basic sitcom that just makes you laugh and have a good time and nothing more. No, Hideaki Sorachi makes you prepared for what&#039;s about to come. He masterfully makes you care about every character and makes you feel these characters with a well-paced and a masterfully written story. Some story arcs from Gintama are easily the best of anime ever. The best thing about Sorachi&#039;s writing is that he doesn&#039;t do 500 episode story arcs that can be finished in 10 episodes. Sorachi does small story arcs but he does them in a way that you can connect to the storyline emotionally and he makes you care about these eccentric plots. Gintama is a masterclass at storytelling and is a masterpiece from start to finish.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
Every main character, every villian, every pointless filler character, every ridiculous character you can think of, matters. Sorachi can make you cry your heart out for a character that you&#039;ve only seen for 4 episodes and when he does make you cry, he absolutely fucking destroys your heart. Characters like Nobume, Katsura, Sasaki can make you think that they&#039;re useless characters but after a while they slowly become your favorite characters. Sorachi understands how a human feels,acts and speaks and he can easily show it to you!<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 11/10<br />
If someone is watching and isn&#039;t enjoying, there are two possible answes, 1- they haven&#039;t watched it and they&#039;re fooling you, 2- they are mentally retarted. You can&#039;t spend a single second in Gintama where you&#039;re not enjoying it. Gintama can make you laugh so hard that you cry and also it can make your heart so wrenched it can make you cry again. Gintama is one of a kind and it deserves all the points it gets. A show like gintama will never come again<br />
<br />
<br />
Gintama is a life-changer. BE FOREVER YOROZUYA, i will miss you...

    So I finally got to see my favourite show&#039;s end.Man it was beautiful,I don&#039;t think that there could be a better ending than this one for my beloved Gintama.<br />
<br />
The movie was absolutely stunning in each and every aspect, plotwise it was great ,with numerous comedic ,action and emotional scenes .<br />
<br />
The artstyle and animation were honestly gorgeous.<br />
One should also not forget the divine themes and songs made by SPYAIR and DOES ,their work not only in Gintama,but also in general is amazing,so check them out in case you already have not.<br />
<br />
Damn,I cannot express how much I enjoyed that movie and Gintama in general, it&#039;s probably one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408884">
        of the few series that affected the way I am as a person.<br />
<br />
It was a wild ride and honestly the most beautiful I had so far.<br />
Thank you for these 6 years of Gintama beauty,Sorachi-sensei.

    It was the most satisfying ending to my beloved series Gintama. It&#039;s heartbreaking to think I won&#039;t be seeing any newer adventures of the Yorozua, Shinsengumi, and really every other character. I laughed with them, I cried with them, they were nothing short of a family to me. <br />
This final act was, quite truly, the essence of Gintama, with hilarious, baffling, stupid, emotional, action-filled, and heartbreaking moments alike. <br />
The animation was nice, but I felt it to be a bit lacking at times, especially noticeable in the fights towards the beginning. <br />
The music was great as ever, and with both DOES and SPYAIR returning one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408690">
        last time, you couldn&#039;t ask for more.<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t goodbye, as I&#039;ll cherish the memories I made with this show, this story forever... and even though an eternity wouldn&#039;t be enough to express my feelings, I&#039;d like to say from the bottom of my heart - thank you Gin-san, thank you everyone, thank you Sorach- I meant Gorilla sensei... Be Forever Yorozua! Be Forever GinTama! <br />
<br />
