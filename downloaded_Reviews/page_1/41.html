    Tales of Vikings pillaging and plundering have always been exciting in my eyes, so the setting of Vinland Saga really grasped my attention. An anime produced by Wit Studio featuring a more historical take on the adventures of Vikings? What could possibly go wrong? A lot apparently. While it started off really promising, Vinland Saga got increasingly worse as it went along. And just like the serene land of England that the Vikings damaged and maimed, the Vikings did the same to the quality of this anime. Though it was primarily one Viking in particular.<br />

Frickin Thorfinn <br />

This dude is apparently the protagonist of the story,

        but he does absolutely nothing to deserve this title. No wait, he runs like Naruto and is OP for some inexplicable reason after receiving absolutely no adequate training throughout his young life, so I guess he does check off most of the boxes for &quot;generic anime protagonist.&quot; Unfortunately, he has zero semblance of development until the very end of the anime. And his personality throughout the entire show is as stale as expired bread. Now I don&#039;t care if he evolves much more as a person in the much longer source material. I&#039;m basing everything off of what I see in the anime, and what I see is a poorly written character whose total stagnancy is astounding. Also, Vinland Saga is considered to be a historical anime and boasts a more realistic take on Vikings. Now no one, least of all me, expected this anime to be entirely realistic. I mean come on, it&#039;s an anime after all. But when Thorfinn can accomplish feats like casually charging through hundreds of arrows shot at his head, leaping 12 feet in the air over a moat, sprinting up the side of a vertical castle wall, and running through dozens of trained soldiers in armor while making abrupt slashing motions with his knives that decapitate all of them with one slice, then I start to have a problem with the &quot;realism&quot; factor. Moments like these had deleterious effects on the quality of the anime in my eyes, and Thorfinn&#039;s inexplicable demigod-like feats of strength and skill when compared to the generally normal capabilities of the majority of the rest of the cast caused a disconnect with the historical direction that the anime seemed to be aiming for.<br />
<br />
Of course that loud, mountain of a man Thorkell is somehow worse when it comes to absolutely shattering any sense of realism that Vinland Saga was aiming for, but I don&#039;t even want to attempt to talk about that horrendously written character.<br />
<br />
Yes, I believe Thorfinn failed spectacularly as a protagonist. But thankfully, there&#039;s Askeladd. He&#039;s honestly much more of a main character than Thorfinn, and is actually quite compelling and given a believable reason for his actions. He&#039;s clearly the deepest character and most entertaining part of the show, and despite my issues with many aspects of the anime *cough* Thorfinn *cough* he kept things interesting. He&#039;s the type of character that you initially want to hate but then grow to appreciate as time goes on, and I have to commend Vinland Saga for writing him in such a compelling way. But even Askeladd couldn&#039;t save Vinland Saga from falling into mediocrity. And that&#039;s thanks to the inclusion of another certain character.<br />
<br />
Frickin Canute <br />
<br />
Canute is a Norse princess waifu...but he&#039;s a dude. The entire arc surrounding Canute can be summarized as Askeladd&#039;s vikings with Canute in tow march through all of England in fear of Thorkell&#039;s vikings who are in pursuit. It&#039;s terribly boring and is worsened by Canute constantly whining to his cone-headed adviser until even Askeladd gets annoyed by his character and tries to make a man out of him. Canute remains stagnant for many episodes until he has this incredibly pathetic and laughable epiphany about love that doesn&#039;t really make any sense and his character suddenly does a complete 180. His voice proceeds to drop an octave and his eyes get smaller and sharper to visually imply that yes, Canute&#039;s balls have finally dropped. His character transformation is so abrupt and nonsensical that I can only describe it as a monumental failure when it comes to development. This is especially sad because I know that the author of Vinland Saga has the ability to write quality characters. He did it with Askeladd after all. It just feels like he sort of gave up on trying to realistically develop Canute over a proper period of time and was just like &quot;Screw it, he&#039;s a badass now!&quot; Which is honestly quite unfortunate.<br />
<br />
I also find the narrative to be quite weak and lazily written. Sure, it shows on multiple occasions how harsh and cruel Vikings can be, but in reality it just depicts a bunch of dudes traveling around accomplishing not much of anything for like 20 episodes with a few &quot;dark&quot; moments sprinkled in to remind viewers that they&#039;re watching a medieval fantasy. I honestly couldn&#039;t find much depth or intrigue in this anime at all. It&#039;s just not interesting to me whatsoever and feels like a ginormous waste of time. And the whole revenge plot surrounding Thorfinn and Askeladd had about as much substance as the awful revenge plot featured in Masamune-Kun&#039;s Revenge. Which is to say that there&#039;s practically zero substance, as it never feels like Thofinn makes any progress whatsoever at getting back at Askeladd. Now this would be fine if the anime took the route of trying to develop their bond and bring them closer over the years, but it doesn&#039;t feel like that either. That is of course until the anime force feeds us that angle at the end in a last ditch attempt to derive some emotional impact...sorry, it didn&#039;t work. The whole show is just Thorfinn being perpetually angry at Askeladd and Askeladd being sort of indifferent to Thorfinn, which was quite disappointing for me. It made the whole anime feel sort of pointless. And when I can draw parallels to frickin Masamune-Kun&#039;s Revenge, which is in my opinion one of the poorest produced anime of the 2010s, you just know that Vinland Saga done goofed up somewhere along the line.<br />
<br />
Despite my harsh criticism of Vinland Saga, I don&#039;t actually hate the show or anything. It does have some solid visual and sound work (bar the jarring CGI), courtesy of Wit Studio. And there are some fun fight sequences included. I&#039;m just disappointed that the anime squandered so much potential. While it admittedly starts strong with Thors and finishes strong with Askeladd, the rest...unfortunately isn&#039;t the best.

    After Wit Studio&#039;s incredible job with Attack on titan, they are back this time to tackle a manga that is often compared with the likes of Vagabond and Berserk and was once thought unadaptable.<br />
<br />
Are you interested in Vikings and Norse mythology? Do you want stunning animated action scenes? Good world-building? Great character development? If so, then wait no more as you are bound to enjoy this series.<br />
<br />
The very first scene of the series sets you in the mood and gets you immersed in the story–from the stunning visuals, gorgeous artwork to the ruthless, merciless and outstanding action-packed scenes and astonishing directing. The plot is based

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315092">
        on real historical events and so far, it does a fantastic job narrating it, with careful world-building and character development. The series depicts  Vikings very well: they pillage villages for goods and are not hesitant to kill anyone who tries to stop them from doing so, no matter who they are; even children or older persons.<br />
<br />
Not only Wit studio is doing justice for the manga, but they also did anime original episodes, to develop the main protagonist&#039;s Thorfinn&#039;s character furthermore. So far Thorfinn is a very interesting character. At first, he is just a normal and innocent little boy but after a certain event, we can see how and why he is continually becoming more revenge-driven and violent. On the other hand, we have Askeladd who is a perfect representation of a leader. He is very tactical and even when he seems defeated he can pull out a last trick up his sleeve, even if it is dirty to come out victorious. He garners respect from his men and was undefeated in battle.<br />
<br />
Concerning the animation, it is engrossing and goes perfectly well with the medieval setting of the series. Moreover, some of the background arts are astounding. Yes, there might be CGI here and there but Wit studio usually utilize it very well and it is not as bad as in some other anime.<br />
<br />
Apart from that screaming part at the end of the opening which was kind of edgy, both the latter and the ending is great visually and musically and they fit perfectly well with the series.<br />
<br />
Wit Studio is doing an incredible job with the series so far and you can easily tell that they care about the source material. If they keep it up and stay faithful to the adaptation while also adding things to refine the anime from the manga, then this might just be one of the greatest adaptation ever. <br />
<br />
Conclusion: No moe bullcrap, stunning artwork, consistent and solid animation, characters you feel strong about. This is exactly how an anime should be produced.<br />
<br />

    Every. Damn. Time.<br />
<br />
You hear a ton of hype for a series, assume it must be good, check it out - and it’s a “transitional” (aka midwit) shlock. Meaning, a series that 15 y.o. think is really smart and mature because its themes are more complex and nuanced than the kids shows they’ve experienced so far, yet at the same time is familiar (read: cliched and primitive) enough to not alienate its target audience. Which in the end makes it the same juvenile cheese-fest anyway. Here is a bunch of its massive flaws:<br />
<br />
1. The title would make you think this is a story about vikings. Yeah,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315127">
        sure, it technically is - the same way Marvel’s Thor is about vikings. In truth, it’s a dime-a-dozen battle shounen featuring an edgy teenage boy that shouts a lot, and also superpowers. No, not like My Hero Academia, where superpowers are incorporated into the story, no, sir, that wouldn’t be dumb, and we can’t allow that. It’s just the supposedly normal people in a supposedly historical setting doing nonsensical shit that is the definition of “cheese.” Now, I know what the counterargument here is - “it doesn’t have to be realistic.” Which is true, a story doesn’t have to be realistic - it has to make sense within its own established rules. Let’s use another series, Berserk, for contrast - because that’s a series that Vinland Saga has absolutely nothing in common with. In Berserk’s chapter 1 we see Guts cut a dude in half with his BFS. It’s not realistic at all - “that thing was too big to be called a sword...” etc. But it is believable - if someone is strong enough to swing that (which Guts is for plot reasons), it totally would cut a dude in half. And it actually looks cool, thus passing under the Rule of Cool. Meanwhile, here in Zombieland Saga we have Axe Guy, a regular human who cuts four people and a mast with a single axe swing. Four people standing in a square formation 2 meters away from each other and the mast in the middle of the square - with a single swing of a regularly-sized woodcutter’s axe. Which does NOT make sense. Unless it’s a magical 4-dimensional axe that cuts through space-time continuum. Which wasn’t established at any point. Which makes it cringy bullshit. I know, I know - “just turn your brain off...” No.<br />
<br />
2. The so-called “vikings” are blatantly 21st century Japanese culture-wise. Quoting Sun Tzu, doing ninja moves, Naruto-running - it’s surprising they aren’t eating yakisoba with chopsticks, that would fit right in. This is actually an example from quite a bit further in the story, but at one point a character says “I like playing on hard mode.” Yes, these are the actual words. For anyone not seeing a problem - videogames with difficulty modes weren’t a thing in 900 A. D.<br />
<br />
3. The “if you kill your enemies you’re just like them”-level moral preaching. I’m not even going to dignify it with refuting. There is one of the main characters, let’s call him DIO (you’ll get it soon) who preaches this sort of 21st century first world pacifism, despite it being literally insane in his cultural context. Same deal, the problem isn’t that a character having insane morals isn’t realistic - the problem is that it isn’t believable. If a character acquires morals that contradict his environment (contradict not being dead in his environment), there is gotta be adequate development showing how this would happen. Of which there is jack shit. No, the “tell, don’t show” exposition that even knows itself that it’s a damage control attempt does not count as an adequate development.<br />
<br />
4. Godawful, I-threw-up-in-my-mouth, CLANG-level CGI. It’s not bad looking in the same technical way as CLANG 2016, it’s just on the same level of incompetence. Just to rub it in, we’re treated to this eye-rape from the very first scene of the series - you know, the scene that is supposed to be literally the best looking part of the show to entice the audience. There we meet DIO and Axe Dude who casually slaughters two (historically inaccurate) longboats worth of people. DIO is DIO because he uses ZA WARUDO - i.e. 30 people stay frozen in time while he moves between them, cutting people vertically in half with movements that have so little weight behind them, realistically he wouldn’t cut paper. Like, completely frozen in time - that is, they are non-animated 2D stills slapped right in the middle of a 3D background that is doing all sorts of dynamic camera movements. The result is so jarring, the dudes look like they were photoshopped in after the fact, with zero effort put into making it look seamless. It’s literally a textbook example of how not to animate. Yes, literally, they teach this in animation courses. Axe Lad somehow got it even worse - he moves. That is, his 2D still moves through 3DCG, the result looking pretty close to poorly done paper cutout animation. Also 3D environment is what makes his hyperdimensional slash stand out in such a bad way, cause you clearly see distances between objects and how geometry-defying his superpower is. I could continue, I just really don’t want to.<br />
<br />
1/10 for “lowest common denominator schlock.” <br />

    “From the distant north, beyond the frozen sea… They came, bringing with them the black clouds of war.”<br />
<br />
As the struggles between English and Danes grew worse each passing year, calls for peace had diminished, and death became commonplace. In the wake of these restless times were Vikings; violent raiders who reaped the spoils of war and marched to the beat of their drum. Brutal, merciless and unfeeling, they pillaged whoever they pleased and left only wreckage behind them. And raised by the band who murdered his father is Thorfinn, a young boy driven by hatred, longing to cut down the one responsible and avenge his

        past.<br />
<br />
This is the tale of Vinland Saga, a sprawling epic penned by Makoto Yukimura that thrusts you into a world drenched in bloody violence and battle-hungry warriors. At least, that is what the manga first introduces readers to. Whereas the anime, produced by Wit Studio with director Shuuhei Yabuta at the helm, decides to take a different approach with the saga by telling its narrative chronologically. Aside from a short battle sequence, viewers aren’t subjected with carnage outright, but a calm and tranquil village on the coast of Iceland untouched by the remnants of war. In doing so, it trades the fast-paced feel of its original story for a more methodical slow burn that fortunately retains enough intrigue and uneasiness to keep it from becoming a tedious watch.<br />
<br />
Such a change carries significant implications for the remainder of its runtime, altering the show’s focus in such a way that brings more light to the world at large. Yukimura is often praised for his passion of technical realism as displayed in his previous work Planetes. Vinland Saga is no different, taking inspiration from Nordic tales that combine elements of culture, family and overarching philosophy into an engrossing plot. Here these features are given slightly more consideration, with early episodes providing a greater representation of the lifestyles embodied in this realistic setting. The nameless faces we encounter, though unimportant to the story at large do feel like real people, with their own goals, families and livelihoods. This level of realism is also found through various anime-only scenes later in the series, that both maintain the steady pace of the show between key events and help in conveying an appropriate air of verisimilitude for its interpretation of the saga at large.<br />
<br />
With a more methodical approach comes a better understanding of Vinland Saga’s characters initially. Some may be inclined to point out how this comes at the cost of cast members losing some degree of subtlety, feeling forced in the process. But what is important to note is that characters early on lay the foundation for the development of our protagonist. Thorfinn is easily impressionable and holds a curious eye from those he admires, most notably his father who he learned the concepts of honour and courage from. His actions when his morals are tested, and more importantly Thorfinn’s reactions aim to give viewers a clearer look at the bigger picture – a story of personal and global discovery. It is more than happy to let viewers dwell on the tender moments and melancholic scenery before the story inevitably shifts gears. As a child, Thorfinn sat at the feet of the great explorer Leif Erickson, captivated by his thrilling tales and in turn longed for adventure of his own. However, those youthful fantasies are soon shattered in a raid that leaves the boy craving revenge on the band’s leader, Askeladd.<br />
<br />
Vinland Saga thrives off the dichotomy between Thorfinn and Askeladd. A child’s innocence ruined with only vengeance left in its place, and a man that epitomizes what any Viking would want in a leader: strong, intelligent, calculated and charismatic. One wears his deadened heart on his sleeve, unfazed by the “comrades” around him and content with watching the world burn, while the other holds a silver tongue and laid-back demeanour, masking his desire for influence by any means necessary. Thorfinn is willing to take part in whatever atrocities asked of him if it means bringing him closer to killing his commander, even though he’s just a pawn in the greater game Askeladd is playing. Their relationship is one that walks on thin ice, giving each of their interactions a hint of uncertainty. Not only is it hard to predict how the plot will progress and subsequently where it&#039;ll take this band of misfits, but also how Thorfinn will be able to achieve his revenge, if at all. <br />
<br />
Consistent characterization is arguably the show&#039;s greatest strength, as within a story so epic in scope lies a profound study of character archetypes. The source material knows that historical stories often require authentic characters and the adaptation does not forget this. Vikings are neither vicious by nature nor are they depicted as idealized figures of legend, just men hardened through tough lives with dreams of making a fortune. The raids are done less out of malice but rather from the need to survive in a landscape where winters are long and resources are scarce. These warriors are humanized to an extent that prompts questions on the nature of war and those who voluntarily take part in such. The world and its inhabitants are considered for with a more holistic perspective than what anime normally offers, delivering on its rare setting that warrants a mature audience. There have been criticisms lobbied at the anime regarding some of the exaggerated feats of power and use of clichés as if it were a shounen story, which I find ironic given the manga was originally published as a shounen before being moved to a seinen magazine. Being a relatively faithful adaptation, the anime incorporates these parts but gradually grounds them into the plot, convincingly enough to where it slowly but surely no longer requires as much suspension of disbelief from the viewer.<br />
<br />
While Vinland Saga is rich in depth and subtext, it is still a story steeped in action and combat. Unfortunately, this is where the anime suffers most. It’s worth pointing out that this show does have its merits visually; art director Yusuke Takeda and his staff at studio BAMBOO boast some astounding digital background art that capture the gravity in times of mourning and sorrow. The voice acting performances – Thorfinn’s especially – are excellent in bringing the struggles and emotions to life. Character designs by Takahiko Abiru do well to imitate Yukimura’s artwork – albeit not with such excellent attention to detail or graphic displays of savagery, but still quite serviceable enough for a TV anime. There’s this myth that Vinland Saga is among the likes of Berserk, Kingdom and Vagabond as manga considered impossible to adapt. This is hyperbole, as apart from Vagabond’s aesthetic, these can all be realistically recreated in anime depending mostly on the staff, budget and scheduling. Fixating on atrocious efforts in the last decade only soils the standards that fandoms will have for future attempts. Thankfully, this adaptation is generally effective in transforming the majority of the manga’s illustrations and panel compositions to animated form... Expect for one key aspect: the action. <br />
<br />
The battles in Vinland Saga look about as disorderly as the computer-generated ocean that our cast frequently sail over. Of course, that isn’t the say that water is the only thing that is CG: the boats are always CG, the foot soldiers often turn CG, the entire environment in long-shots end up being CG, and all these examples of CG integration look especially jarring. It’s reminiscent of Shuuhei Yabuta’s work overseeing the 3D animation on Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2, with short yet often noticeable faults. The direction overall is still an improvement over his last directorial effort on Inuyashiki, even holding flashes of excellence as the different animation styles, models and digital effects merge into great action sequences. But these moments are few and far between a multitude of scenes looking as though they were haphazardly worked on and do not coalesce well in comparison. <br />
<br />
Even the more experimental cinematography such as first-person perspective shots that appear great in concept pale in contrast to other anime that pulled off the same technique far better in the same year (Mob Psycho anyone?). By the time it finishes airing, there will be those eager to shower this series with immense praise for the art and animation, whilst forgetting to mention the inconsistent nature of its visuals. It’s tumultuous. There are great screenshots you can take of the anime at its most expressive and colourful – most of which are found away from the action. Likewise, there are short clips that highlight the visual blandness and worse portions that barely look as though they belong to the same season. The action still holds tension and weight when watching, but half the time you are probably better off glossing over them. <br />
<br />
These action scenes do gradually improve over the season, even if simply by not being as ambitious as before. However, there still lies various issues within the script that are worth mentioning, if only for their lasting effect on the project. Earlier I pointed out the importance of historical accuracy in Vinland Saga that pervades every corner of its setting. For the most part, the anime remains accurate in its portrayal of 11th century Northern Europe. But the screenplay is where most of its discrepancies exist. The staff in charge of writing such altered sections from the source material that acknowledge proper cultures, only to have such be overwritten for what I can only surmise as for the sake of localization. This furthermore muddles the various languages that characters are meant to speak throughout the story. There were never complaints about the manga including morsels of lore into the plot, and all these changes do is needlessly break immersion and consistency. This dialogue is also laden with telling the viewer actions that are clearly shown seconds beforehand. These could easily be brushed aside as nitpicking, but when these instances happen time and time again, it’s no longer a nitpick; it’s a recurring problem.<br />
<br />
But nevertheless, these problems do little to take away from the overall experience that makes Vinland Saga such a special piece of fiction in the realm of manga and now anime. While the premise does tell a tale of revenge, there is a balance ever-present. It rides a line which avoids getting too heady for its own good, but at the same time follows a linear path that realizes its potential to be intellectually stimulating. Drawing you in with its copious amounts of violence, before peeling back the layers to reveal something truly meaningful. Look beyond the strokes of bloodshed from mere pawns and see what caused these acts to occur. Vinland Saga casts a mirror over this time in history, on both famous figures and those forgotten overtime and simply asks us to think over what is shown. Consider if Thorfinn really has any enemies to justify his pursuit for vengeance. Ponder over the musings of a priest that fall on the deaf ears of most Vikings. And imagine if there were a land somewhere, far from slavery and the flames of war. <br />
<br />
Of all the clashing ideals of love, war and pacifism at play, the most fascinating comes from Prince Canute. Hard to fathom at first, being introduced as timid and weak, even drawn with a bishounen appearance. His inexperience in times of conflict and inability to function without his servant make him wholly unfit to rule over anyone, as demonstrated once held hostage by Askeladd. Every man is a slave to something: Thorfinn to his anger, Askeladd to the past, Thorkell to the battlefield and Canute to his own comfort. But it is once he loses the person closest to him when the shackles around him are broken. His preconceived notions about the world are shattered, leading to a startling epiphany where he is born anew as the strong leader history remembers. Canute’s ambition to spite God and create a utopia on Earth is chilling to watch develop, with heavy piano music accompanied that while ill-suited for the setting, hits all the emotional beats. His motivations not only serve as a compelling transformation of his character, but bring into question basic tenets of love and freedom with an intriguing yet complex theological framework. If the Vikings represent a struggle of maintaining independence, Canute&#039;s arc symbolises the first steps toward a nation state, where freedom is forcibly exchanged for stability – and the Prince is more than willing to cut his father down to achieve that dream.<br />
<br />
‘Every action has a consequence.’<br />
<br />
Behind the brutality and political scheming lies this constant message. They are felt by each character and echoed through the narrative. In part, this is what makes Vinland Saga such an unpredictable journey. Thorfinn’s past catches up to him and tries to sway him from the existence he chose after seeing his father slain with his own eyes. Askeladd’s craftiness and quick decision-making for years has brought him to serve under Canute as his right-hand man. And the Prince’s circumstances caused by the King’s order has resulted in the emergence of his greatest threat to the crown. From the beginning, the series has prepared its stage for an inevitable impasse, with each piece carefully positioned for their own personal growth. But despite all the planning and deliberation possible, the world may decide to deal you a different hand. The nature of the world is unflinching, with unexpected endings sometimes being peaceful, tragic and even undeserved, for better or for worse. After everything being built up to this moment, we are given more questions than answers, and left in shambles, unsure of what awaits these characters in the saga’s next entry. The prologue concludes. Such is life, and such is history.<br />
<br />

For years, Vinland Saga has been proclaimed as a must-read classic manga, and here the anime does it justice. It’s a powerful tale with well-defined, palpable characters all living in a harsh yet beautifully captured world brought to life by rich colours, stellar landscapes and a varied selection of melodies that help convey a specific tone. Presenting the narrative in a different medium where it does falter on occasion, but essentially stays true to the heart of Vinland Saga, even providing original content that compliment the core material with a strong directorial voice and impressive execution. Some may be concerned for where the series can go after such an ending. But let me assure you that Vinland Saga knows what kind of story it’s telling, and it is nothing short of remarkable. <br />

    If Don LaFonaine narrated Vinland Saga from the start, he’d begin the show with “In a world….” In Vinland Saga, we are introduced to a Viking world, a world of historical fiction rich with culture and testing the limits of survival. Based on the manga of the same name, it’s a show that teaches more than about survival. If you’re ready to embark on this epic adventure, then be ready for a 24-episode saga like you’ve never experienced before.<br />
<br />
Thorfinn Thorsson is the Icelandic protagonist, a character with complex personality driven with an ambition. After the death of his father, he becomes a warrior, someone who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325201">
        will do whatever it takes to get his revenge. In this 11th century, the audience must understand how barbaric life is. Every day is an adventure where possibilities are almost limitless. Vinland Saga is very engrossing with a rich culture and preaches to the elements of historical fiction. This anime adaptation adapts a story to get us familiar with its Viking world, the harsh life of Thorfinn Throsson, and what it means to survive.<br />
<br />
Besides Planetes, Vinland Saga is mangaka Makoto Yukimura’s most prominent work. The anime adaptation remains faithful throughout the series but the director does mention that “there will be some adjustments to the manga”. With that in mind, the audience shouldn’t need to worry too much because Vinland Saga is fundamentally an adaptation for fans of the original series. The first few episodes takes off to showcase the violence and barbaric nature of the 11th century. From the harsh weather to immense amount of bloodshed, it is obvious the producers wanted to make the anime feels as real as possible. Wit Studio managed to carry a caliber of high production quality throughout a great deal of this series. The landscapes and Baltic Sea are illustrated with gorgeous visual quality enhanced by its realism. The scenes in some episodes contains elements of photorealism, characteristics that makes this show’s visual quality nothing less than a near masterpiece. There’s a Viking culture that we must quickly adapt to such as the rough clothing, crude ships, and historical weapons. Vehicles are replaced by horses and technology is crafted by the hands of humankind. In essence, this anime retains a beautiful setting but with dark elements of complex storytelling.<br />
<br />
With the characters in mind, Thorfinn is the central protagonist as we focus on his rebellious life. During his childhood, he was happier like an ordinary kid before his life changed forever. Now, he carries a vengeful attitude with a rebellious nature while trusting almost no one but himself. He is what I describe as a survivalist, someone who is opportunistic, wild, and unpredictable. He is fundamentally a decent person although some of his actions are questionable throughout the series. It’s hard to judge his character altogether in this adaptation but based on his actions, you could say he is far from a heroic protagonist. What is important is the relationship he develops with others in particular, Askeladd, the man who manipulated Thorfinn into his service. This becomes a complex relationship because Askeladd was contracted to kill Thors, Thorfinn’s father. As leader of his own Viking band, he is an important figure because of his influence on Thorfinn. And the more you watch Vinland Saga, the more you’ll realize how much certain characters have influence over others.<br />
<br />
Taking some steps back, the audience should also be familiar with Thors, the father of Thorfinn. As one of the most powerful character in the franchise, Thors is a testament and symbol of warrior. And despite not being around as much as the other characters, Thors teaches us what it means to be a true warrior. This is somewhat in contrast to Thorkell, a barbaric man with inhuman strength and widely considered to be one of the most brutal warriors in the series. He loves the thrill of fighting, to always find powerful opponents, and tests his strength. After encountering Thorfinn, he comes to respect the boy for his inner strength and determination. He is even somewhat honorable in that when facing against worth opponents, he prefers to settle it in a fair fight, without interference or bias. In my eyes, he is a breakout character to always keep an eye on.<br />
<br />
But Vinland Saga isn’t just about barbarism and violence. It has a society ruled by order with laws and dictatorship. From within the story, we meet Canute, a prince with a cowardly personality and bishonen-like appearance. Created as a foil as some of the main characters, he starts off as a meek man but transforms into a strong headed prince after losing someone close in his life. And that’s what makes Vinland Saga so meaningful. Character deaths are impactful and causes people to change as in the way it’s meant to. I can honestly say from heart that character evolution in Vinland Saga is one of the core fundamentals of the series. It’s not just about evolving characters either but showing the reality of death. It’s a clever way to avoid character assassination by changing their personalities through events. As I watched more of the show, it becomes more and more intriguing to understand each one. Unfortunately, a 2-cour adaptation does limit the potential of full character development. There’s much more to be found in the manga but that’s for another story.<br />
<br />
If I said it once, I’ve said it a hundred times. Vinland Saga contains a cruel world and filled with moments of despair, emotions, and conviction driven by action. If you’re here to see fan service, it’s served with bloodshed and body horror, not half naked women. It has little time to humor as its time period isn’t an era to enjoy life. It’s to survive in it. What will seduce the audience to this series’ theme ultimately come down its hallmark of creative realism. It manages to be exactly what it advertised from the start and in Thors’ words, make a “true warrior with no sword”.

    There is a profound feeling to Vinland Saga. Whether or not the events depicted are entirely accurate, you are watching monumental history unfold. Although it is frustrating at times, it&#039;s gripping in the end. <br />
<br />
Warrior&#039;s pride, loss of innocence, betrayal, and the quest for the biggest bounty: This is what it means to be a Viking in Vinland Saga. In the beginning, our hero Thorfinn was just a kid, and his immaturity is prevalent throughout the series. Slowly—and frustratingly—he grows into a man. His father, the great Viking general, Thors, raised him to be a compassionate person until his untimely death. Stay away from the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325266">
        path of a Viking, never kill, take care of your family. These were the values Thors taught him. When Thors was murdered right before Thorfinn&#039;s innocent eyes, none of these values mattered. Instead of growing up, Thorfinn survived his childhood by learning to kill. Years passed, and he became an angst-ridden killing machine.<br />
<br />
Enduring the bitter frost of northern Europe was the least of his problems; he needed to prove himself on the battlefield for a chance at revenge. The power that drives him is a hunger to seek revenge against the mercenary leader, Askeladd—this is where Thorfinn shines. His perseverance in the face of impossible odds shows he has real motivation anyone can believe. Thorfinn&#039;s frustrating immaturity is intentional, but what kept me caring about his journey was his slow evolution. I told myself that even if he doesn&#039;t grow up this season, it will come. His arc is a slow one, but I don&#039;t doubt he will improve in later seasons. Thorfinn&#039;s immaturity extends to his duels with Askeladd too. He makes the same mistakes over and over. He is desperate to win, yet his anger gets the best of him. Once Thorfinn loses his temper, he waves his sword like a maniac and gives up strategy. As Askeladd points out, he is predictable. Even so, the fights are still very entertaining. Askeladd critiques his fighting techniques and gives him a purpose in life. To grow and one day murder him. <br />
<br />
Over time, Askeladd becomes the closest thing Thorfinn has to a father. Witnessing their complicated duality throughout the show is genuinely intriguing. I&#039;ll admit it was quite frustrating to see Thorfinn try to kill Askeladd in duels, yet he was always eager to save his life during battles. It allowed their relationship to be dragged on for as long as possible, hindering Thorfinn&#039;s growth. Thankfully, Askeladd more of a protagonist of this season. He is the best character by far. He leads his army of mercenaries, but there&#039;s more to him than meets the eye. He is the wild card of the cast. He has the most in-depth backstory; throughout the show, his motivations become profoundly nuanced as we learn about him. The strategies he concocts are exciting to see play out—He&#039;s a villain, but a clever one. Like Askeladd, the entire cast is from different European countries. Despite this, all of the dialogue gets voiced in Japanese. Usually, I wouldn&#039;t be bothered by this at all. It&#039;s done in movies/TV all the time. You should expect to suspend your disbelief. It would be unrealistic to expect a TV anime to use multiple languages, but it led to problems. Occasionally people need to translate different languages to form allegiances or communicate with enemies. But they&#039;re all speaking Japanese, so it comes off as awkward.<br />
<br />
A language barrier is an integral part of war stories between different cultures. The lack of understanding for each other fuels prejudices, which sparks hatred between either side of the battlefield. Vinland Saga misses this entirely—which is hardly a knock against its high-quality production. I wish they would have hired some actors who spoke a little bit of the languages. Norsk, English, Danish, Icelandic, all absent. The script addresses this somewhat by using different Japanese dialects and honorifics between social classes. A better fix would have been to fix mix in certain words or phrases from the existing languages. The language barrier could quickly fix this minor flaw with an English dub. <br />
<br />
There are times the violence gets so unrealistic you might mistake it as an ultraviolent schlockfest. It&#039;s far more believable than WIT Studio&#039;s other blood-soaked action anime like Attack on Titan and less ridiculous than Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. Dozens of people get chopped in half, decapitated, and dismembered throughout the show. Some of the gore bends the fabric of reality with how absurd it gets. You shouldn&#039;t be shocked by it. Instead, you get placed in the bloodthirsty mindsets of the savage killers. Violence is commonplace to Vinland Saga. It&#039;s just as thrilling for the Vikings as it is for the audience.<br />
<br />
When the giant warrior Thorkell the Tall decapitates five people AND takes down a ship mast with a throw of an axe, I laughed along with him. This anime is aware of how unbelievably violent Vikings were, and it leans into it—and I love it. However, it&#039;s not all fun and games. Once you realize that the hands of evil psychos carried out the action you&#039;ve been enjoying—you start to question your morality too. In stark comparison to the entertaining battles is the real shock factor. Men, women, and children get mercilessly slaughtered in droves. To show a loving family for five minutes only to kill them all right after is horrible, senseless, but yet it is part of the world. At first, it seemed like shock factor, and then I realized it is true to the historical setting. The mass murders were part of history, and Vinland never shies from the truth. It&#039;s never afraid to be nihilistic—like in one instance where a sole survivor of a murdered family is left behind to hear the sounds of their kin getting slaughtered. The camera hovers around them until their final moments. Full of despair. You will remember the real lives the Vikings brutally stole. It&#039;s horrible being on the side of villains like these. <br />
<br />
Most of the screen time in Vinland Saga is either fights, arguments, or dialogue. Politics of power struggles, contemplating morality in war, and conjuring witty strategies. When the script integrates real background information into the story, it shines. In one scene, Askeladd tortures a man while arguing that both sides of the war are savages by detailing their land&#039;s history. To prevent the plot from seeming predictable, they use plenty of paranoia-inducing foreshadowing. The script suffers from a common anime adaptation issue where characters over-explain what we can see for ourselves. Manga often describes movement with text; unfortunately, they left these lines in the adaptation. There were many times when fights would be interrupted by cross-cutting to people talking, halting the pace.<br />
<br />
Rather than always focusing on the main characters, the script often follows various mercenaries; they discuss their past and future battles and share their opinions on other people. The slow pacing made room for a well-written script, but also for it to meander. Men would banter about heaps of money and women being the meaning of their lives. While a drunken priest would mumble about ale being his only God now. It fit the show so well; none of them had meaning in their lives other than drinking, killing, fucking, then dying a warrior&#039;s death. Then Canute entered the show. Rejected by his father, the king, he is sent to war to grow into a man or die trying. His arc writes itself, yet he&#039;s one of the most compelling characters. The Vikings mock his firm Christian values. With an earnest dream of creating world peace—spurred by his religion—I found myself rooting for him. The themes are pro-religion; the devils are the Vikings because they&#039;ve forsaken God, and every Christain is innocent. Compared to the devils, the Christians get led like lambs to a slaughter. We see the story from the devils&#039; perspective; they reject God&#039;s path and forsake him for letting horrors happen. Instead, they choose to pave their way in blood. Over time, the themes get discussed by Canute and the priest. They feel more like mouthpieces than well-rounded characters, despite their relevance to the plot. The discussions of morality in Vinland might come off as pretentious and convoluted to some viewers. The art carries much of the weight in making these ankle-deep philosophies feel profound.<br />
<br />
There are moments the art looks manga quality—close-ups drawn with incredible detail to emphasize severity. Deep shadows beneath wrinkles and strained muscles, showing the weathered souls of the characters. Those are the faces you will remember. There are several imaginative storyboards used to convey the conflicting motives between characters. Boundaries separate them, and trees divide them in the frame to symbolize their unspoken hatred. The radiant light of hope shines emanating from behind the compassionate people shines down on the tormented savages below; on the nose perhaps, but powerful nonetheless. The artists drew the backgrounds beautifully. Always the sky is shrouded with clouds, which is why the lighting has a cool hue. Warm red sunsets radiate beautifully just beyond the horizon through white skies, contrasted against the horrible blood splattered across the snow-covered forests redder than ripe tomatoes. <br />
<br />
Harsh snowstorms whip across the screen; gorgeous, but sometimes distracting because the CGI weather feels disconnected from the picture. Speaking of which, Vinland&#039;s egregious use of CGI is quite unfortunate. The animators rendered cannon fodder soldiers and ships at a low framerate. It is reminiscent of the ugly art used in the schlockfest Inuyashiki—the director&#039;s previous adaptation. The use of CGI is not in vain, however. It allowed for 3D dynamic camera movements during fight scenes. Yet, the camera lingers too close to the eyes-searing CGI and for way too long. As for the music, it&#039;s okay. Nothing I would seek out on my own, even though it fits the show well. The opening songs are both light metal, closer to metalcore. I love it when anime try something different with their theme songs. As metal songs, they are fine. For WIT Studio&#039;s standards, this anime isn&#039;t entirely on the level of Attack on Titan or Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. Thankfully, it has a stronger narrative than both.<br />
<br />
After a full season, Vinland Saga has only just begun. If this represents what&#039;s to come, I&#039;m thrilled to see where this story goes from here. Perhaps it moved too slowly for a lengthy prologue; nevertheless, it was engaging. With beautifully drawn artwork, a well-realized setting, and creative writing, this adaptation is impressive in many aspects. With this merely being a prologue, a sequel will be promising if it mends this season&#039;s flaws. It gets weighed down by reality-bending action sequences, a frustrating main character, cliched plotting, and redundant themes. Although it struggles along the way, it sticks the landing with a fantastic finale. Vinland Saga rises above its flaws to become an authentic piece of Eleventh Century historical fiction.

    Anime series that are exclusively aimed for adult audience have been disappearing from this medium faster than top anime lists on the Internet have been overtaken by overrated seasonal garbage. That&#039;s quite a tempo. Long gone are those days when maturity meant more than throwing in couple gore scenes and tagging the production with an R. Vinland Saga is not a blast from the past. It won&#039;t automatically please every soul that mourns for what anime once was. Nevertheless, Vinland Saga is already one of the most successful series from this ongoing decade when it comes to combining maturity with mainstream appeal. <br />
<br />
[Story and characters]<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315086">
        story of Vinland Saga may be very frustrating to some viewers because some of its characters are naive moral soldiers whose pseudo-noble ideals and philosophies do not go hand in hand with how the world works. &quot;Chaotically good&quot; men figuratively shoot themselves in the leg. Their very way of thinking is their cause of death. Personally, I find this to be very satisfying, because it is fair representation of survival of the fittest. You get what you deserve. In shonen series, those who yell their nakama bs out in the air and plead to &quot;what is the right thing to do&quot;, are usually called main characters. In Vinland Saga, they are called soon-to-be-corpses. <br />
<br />
The core idea is very much the usual Viking story. Exploration, culture, dawn of the new age, fights and violence. Manly men, strong female characters, philosophical wits and inventions that were relevant during this time. All of these sides are very well implemented inside its own story line which is build around the characters in a manner that yells high quality. Since our main character is a growing child who is influenced by different people, we get to see lots of contrast, and even such things as how the living environment affects the growth of a child is not left unnoted. I am personally huge fan of this concept and that&#039;s yet another thing which is dealt masterfully here. Minor flaws are present. Some unrealistic power-levels distant the series from realistic feel to new-long-jump-world-records-in-full-viking-gear ehhs. It&#039;s not a perfect story that does nothing questionable, but it&#039;s very strong and splendidly polished.<br />
<br />
So far, the main points from story department fall under respectable quality, and the characterization has surpassed my critical expectations. Strong build up phase has created one solid foundation for rest of the story, leaving lots of room for improvement in future episodes. On top of that, it only seems to be going for better. It&#039;s linear, logical and coherent. Something which seems to be an impossible task for so many modern series is absolutely nailed here. Vinland Saga has chosen the golden path which can, realistically, realize its potential. Characters-wise, entirely new, anime-exclusive story events have been added to fill in missing links and add substance onto these personas and their reasoning. Basically the opposite of filler content that can be found in source material. Respectable decisions regarding this anime adaptation have been made, and I salute Wit Studios for showing that they do care about their anime. <br />
<br />
[Production]<br />
<br />
The values are high no matter how it&#039;s looked. Not heavenly since sloppy CGI reminds of its existence once in a while and character movements come with copy-pasted frames to a point that it stands out, but to this medium standards&#039;, these values are nothing less than high peak. Episode 05 time stamp 3:19 (Amazon). I mean wow, has even Ghibli managed to create such stunning forest backdrops? These stills are wallpaper-tier, probably drawn by Japanese Bob Ross. Simply mind-blowing work. However, I will focus on commenting on its approach and presentation instead of praising the raw audiovisuals. Some people will really not like what i will say here, but I have decided to say it anyway because I don&#039;t think anyone else will and because this is my honest opinion. Do keep in mind that the following is not &quot;why the art sucks 101&quot;, but rather &quot;how the series could&#039;ve been better&quot;. <br />
<br />
When people talk about anime art, their judgement is almost without exception limited to the technicality and fundamentals of drawing and  animation. But one important factor tends to be forgotten; its message. The content of Vinland Saga does not go in harmony with its audiovisual presentation. There, I said it. The manga  offers layers of maturity that are invisible in this adaptation. The art style does not resonate with the world of Vinland Saga very well. You cannot tell this story with rainbows and unicorns and expect it to present itself flawlessly, but this is what was more or less done. If the series was exclusively about human co-existence with nature, I wouldn&#039;t complain, but this is also about human conflict, war, societal structures, and characters who are enraged and too angry to die. The content can be dark, gritty and very adult, but it surely don&#039;t look like it.<br />
<br />
This is truly unfortunate because it shows us to what extent maturity is avoided in the modern industry. Even the world building is greatly lessened due to the series feeling more-or-less like an AOT clone instead of its very own thing. It&#039;s not a direct copy-paste by any means, but you really don&#039;t need to be a genius to see the similarities either. It&#039;s clear that Wit Studios chose this art approach solely to build mainstream appeal and enter the shekels game. Even the character design is way worse than it should&#039;ve been. Just compare it to the tv series &#039;Vikings&#039; or newest GoW game. How awesome are some of those celestial bodies compared to whatever you want to call an entirely yellow anime beard that looks the same as bishojo hairs from Kuroko no Basket. What I meant to say here is that the production feels unfitting, out of place and very teenager. It&#039;s simply not ideal. This happens when popularity is chosen over art. <br />
<br />
To sum my point up: There is this saying that goes like this: &quot;Art matters, visuals are secondary.&quot; Scarce is the amount of series that present this philosophy as strongly as Vinland Saga. The production does not ruin this show by any means. It can be overlooked and forgiven, but, nevertheless, it requires the viewer (or at least myself as a viewer) to adjust: accept a compromise - and blocks Vinland Saga from entering the tier of Godly anime, and I think this is a very important factor to acknowledge. Since pros and cons are a thing, some decisions that are improvement over source material have also been made, such as the lack of caricature-like comedic reliefs, which honestly no one needs to see in this anime and I am glad they have been left out. <br />
<br />
[Enjoyment]<br />
<br />
We have light novel adaptations and guilty pleasures. Most modern anime is only watchable ironically. The chances for ground breaking anime series vary from slim to nonexistent based to production year. Must watch titles from current production years are counted with one-hand fingers.  When looking back into anime history with historian-goggles, this is not priority nro. 1, but regardless, this is quality time and I cannot recommend it enough for seasonal watchers who seek relevance and modern high-points instead of past gems. <br />
<br />
[Final verdict]<br />
<br />
This could have been an OG Berserk-tier masterpiece if it was made by dedicated studio such as Geno Studios, which have made the most mature anime series seen in several years (at least in my opinion), Golden Kamyu. Wit Studios have simply never dealt with anime that is mature in the way Vinland Saga is, and perhaps that&#039;s why the outcome is far from what I personally thought was possible. Some better decision could have been done to please the core target audience of the manga. But none of the things I criticize Vinland Saga for are enough to make me think that it&#039;s not a good anime. In fact, it&#039;s already among the better things from 2019. If you do not enjoy this anime, please consider reading the manga instead, especially the parts that this anime will cover are phenomenal. In case you do enjoy it, that makes two of us.

    The following will be more of a critique, rather than a review, so expect a lot of spoilers.<br />
<br />
As a foreword I&#039;d like to say that, while I do realise that the historical tag doesn&#039;t contain within itself a &quot;realistic&quot; tag, the events that play out in Vinland Saga are an absolute farce, given the time period and historical background. Even the suspension of disbelief made out of titanuim would eventually crumble and collapse under the amount of stupidity this show contains.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, let&#039;s begin.<br />
<br />
-Characters<br />
<br />
Thors The Troll (aka Thorfinn&#039;s dad) - he is the most ridiculous character in Vinland Saga, as his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325214">
        background, decisions and moral stance make him seem simply insane in the world he inhabits. Thors is the former commander of the Jomsvikings, who, after the life full of war and bloodshed, decides to do a complete 180 after holding the hand of his newborn daughter. No meaningful setup, no explanation, no nothing. A man whose entire existance revolved around warfare, turns into a pacifistic buddha in less than a minute<br />
at the snap of the fingers. If you think that&#039;s acceptable, there&#039;s nothing I can say. Thors also shows his excellent decision making skills as early as the first episode, where he buys a runaway slave at a death&#039;s door. The payment? 8 sheep. Yes, a man that lives in Iceland of all places, during the winter, who also has a family, trades 8 sheep for a man that&#039;s about to die. If that&#039;s not a stunning display of stupidity, I don&#039;t know what is. He is also the strong proponent of childish morals on the level of: &quot;If you kill your enemies, you&#039;re no better than them&quot;. Truly insipiring coming from a man who lives in 11-th century and who also happens to be a former leader of what is essentially a warband. Thors&#039; death is yet again brought about by his inability to make well-thought out and weighted decisions, as he thinks that pirates(!) will honor his request, only to end up being shot down by a squad of archers. He also dies standing tall and proud, because of course he does. I also forgot to mention, that his ridiculous morals are further reinforced with the fact that he always fights unarmed and manages to defeat entire groups of fighters armed with swords, axes, shields and etc., as if he was Kenshiro from Hokuto no Ken.<br />
<br />
Thorfinn - a non-character that is defined by a singular trait and nothing else: a vendetta against Askellad, cause in his twisted logic - it&#039;s Askellad who is responsible for his father&#039;s death, and not his (Thors&#039;) stupidity. There&#039;s really nothing to say about Thorfinn, even if I wanted to. He&#039;s moody and edgy, talks primarily by barking out the same phrase over and over, or using edgy one-liners. Whenever someone mentions his dad he simple flies into a blind rage. As for his abilities as a fighter, he, for whatever reason, has an acrobatic fighting style with dual-wielded daggers (sometimes he weilds even 3 daggers, holding the third one in his mouth, as if he was Roronoa from One Piece), and, like a character that we&#039;ll get to soon, seems to be able to use shukuchi, as there&#039;s no other explanation for his sudden teleportations during fights. <br />
<br />
Askellad - a character that is hailed by fans as someone who is on par (depth and development wise) with such characters as Guts, Spike Spiegel, The Laughing Man, Shinji and etc., you get the idea. That is however, a blatant lie, though I will concur that Askellad is a lot better than the rest. He&#039;s a bastard son of Olaf, a local hero and greatest warrior of some city in Denmark, who once upon a time made &quot;love&quot; with a slave girl from Wales, which resulted in Askellad being born. This awful circumstances result in Askellad having one definitive trait and burning passion. The trait - hatred towards danes. The passion - to kill all said danes, or the very least subjugate them. Taking Askellad seriously was not too hard, until the flashback of his childhood occured in episode 22 or 23, where an 11 year old, who did nothing his entire life except clean the stables, clean the snow and taking out ash from the furnaces and fireplaces (that&#039;s where his name comes from, by the way), managed to hold his own in a duel against his father and local war hero Olaf. How was he able to go toe to toe with someone like that (eve if it was for no longer than 40 seconds) is never explained and the audience is just expect to accept it. Sorry, but that&#039;s not happening.<br />
Another thing he&#039;s known for is his &quot;genius&quot; schemes, in which he attempts to play his enemies, but achieves a pyrrhic victory at best, though he did manage to outwit Thors, but that&#039;s hardly an accomplishment. As he later states himself, most of his problems stem from the fact that his daddy (Olaf) didn&#039;t love him and his mom, and treated them like cattle.<br />
<br />
Canute - a young man, whose timid character and androgynous features lead others to mistake him for a woman. Like the rest of the cast, there&#039;s not much to say about Canute. Since his introduction and until episode 21, he was a sissy that did nothing except prayed to Jesus with his aide and a priest at his side, and abhorred war and everything that&#039;s moderately associated with it, which in turn led everyone else to point and laugh at them. In episode 21, he has a 3 minute discussion with priest about human nature and love, during which he arrives to the conclusion that humanty is flawed by it&#039;s nature, and that he&#039;ll be the one to right the wrongs and save everyone. This, together with the fact that Ragnar (his aide) was killed a few episodes prior, causes his metamorphosis from who he is into a discount version of Griffith from Berserk.<br />
Also, just like Askellad, the core of his issues comes from the fact that his father (the current king of Denmark) didn&#039;t spend a lot of time with him when he was a child and never loved him much nor accepted his unorthodox behaviour (for the times of the setting), which resulted in Canute treating Ragnar (his aide) as his actual father. <br />
<br />
Bjorn - another non-character and Askellad&#039;s right hand man. He&#039;s quite strong, and, in time of need, is known to consume mushrooms that cause him to enter a state of <br />
berserker rage, when he becomes violent to such an extentet that he is unable do distinguish between friend or foe. He&#039;s just there, but at one point he finds out that <br />
Askellad is not a pure dane, and that he actually hates them, which leads Bjorn to defect from Askellad. This conflict concludes in a duel which Bjorn loses, his last words being that<br />
he only wanted to be friends with Askellad *yawn*.<br />
<br />
Thorkell - an individual of exceptional stature, size and physical build, who is said on many occasions to be one of, if not the strongest warrior. In an interesting contrast to this is his behaviour, which is that of a child, as all he does is expresses glee and joy at the though of a battle, and wants nothing esle except that - more fighting. He is also the leader of an army that consisting of 500 men. How those 500 men can consider him a leader and follow him, when he has 0 leadership skills and also doesn&#039;t seem to rule over them with fear, is beyond me. Thorkell is also the character responsible for most damage done to one&#039;s suspension of disbelief, as he lifts boulders that weigh a couple tons above his head and hurls them. At one occasion throws a spear over what seems to be a distance of no less than 400+ meters and manages to impale 4 people on the said spear (somehow), and more.<br />
He used to serve under Thors during his time in Jomsvikings and has great admiration for the man, as he is the only one to ever beat him (how could that have happened is never shown, nor is it beliavble, but w/e). Therefore, he also expects Thorfinn (when he&#039;s confronted with him) to be up to par with Thors in that regard, something that Throfinn barely manages to deliver in their first bout.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast do not warrant to be looked on individually in my opinion, as they can be summed up in a single sentence.<br />
<br />
-Plot<br />
Guess it&#039;s there? The titular Vinland is brought up about 4 times during the course of 24 episodes, some characters think it&#039;s heaven on earth and want to get there, and that&#039;s about it. The plot over the course of 24 episodes encompasses the following: How Thorfinn turned from the cheerful little boy in the first episodes into who he is now. Flashbacks to the past of the main cast, to establish them (which does a very poor job of that). A ring around the rosy between Askellad and Thorkell, which results in their alliance at the end of the day and Canute&#039;s transformation from who he is into a discount Griffith, and the following plotting against King of Denmark. I do undesrtand that it&#039;s a prologue, but in my opinion it&#039;s neither engaging nor interesting.<br />
<br />
-Sound<br />
As I always say, OST is mostly subjective. Some people will like a certain OST, others will not. What is not subjective however, are the awful sound effects that plague this show.<br />
This isn&#039;t the first intstance of horrendous sound effect, as currently running Fate/Grand Order Babylonia suffers from equally awful sound effects, as did many other anime that aired this year. <br />
As for OST, personally, I cannot remember a single track from it, though I do remember the very weird mix of what seems to be a typical orchestral music and hip-hop, which is a very strange choice, and doesn&#039;t work with the atmosphere or the setting. Both OPs and both EDs are pretty bad, especially the second ED, which is simply abhorrent.<br />
<br />
-Art<br />
This has been extensively adressed by a lot of people in preliminary reviews, but I will go over it briefly for the sake of it. The CGI is unbelievably bad, so bad in fact it&#039;s simply indefensible. Attempting to close the eyes on the quality of the CGI here is a disservice to the community and a blatant acceptance of awful mediocrty. The art and animation themself are nothing spectacular either, characters often have silly expressions, are off model and etc. The animation in fights, especially duels, is severly lacking and pairs <br />
awfully with the horrendous sound design. When you&#039;re shown a wideshot of a large scale battle, it&#039;s simply full of same looking 3D CG models that are stuck in a single animation loop.<br />
<br />
-Summary<br />
It&#039;s your average run of the mill shonen devoid of interesting characters and story, very much like Kimetsu no Yaiba that aired earlier this year. But at least Yaiba was done by ufotable and at least it had visuals going for it (2D characters on 3D background still look absolutely vile and awful though). Why is this hailed by majority of people as a better Berserk is something I cannot comprehend whatsoever. What hurts the most, is that it&#039;s from Yukimura Makoto, the original creator of Planetes, a manga that was highly<br />
acclaimed and praised for it&#039;s realistic depiction of space and things associated with it. Planetes also has a magnificient anime adaptation by Sunrise, and is one of the best anime out there. To say that I&#039;m severely dissapointed by Vinland, is to put it very lightly.<br />
<br />
Final Score:<br />
I can&#039;t believe this is from the author of Planetes/10. (1/10).<br />
<br />
I would also like to thank my friend for proof-readind and helping with the editing.

    There was a time when Vinland Saga was considered unadaptable. Along with Berserk, Kingdom and Vegabond, no one would touch it for 15 years.<br />
<br />
Man, have WIT proved everyone wrong. Vinland saga was absolutely masterfully crafted from beginning to end in every aspect. The story follows a young Icelandic adventurer on his quest for revenge so of course there’s great fight scenes, but where Vinland succeeds is its absolutely amazing writing. When watching the series, I genuinely forgot that I was watching an anime at several times. The acting, OST, writing and direction create a very live action experience and just feel Oscar worthy and real.<br />

Vinland

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325215">
        Saga also maintains a very grounded approach throughout. Everything feels realistic. This is not a series with crazy power-ups, energy blasts, superpowers, etc. It’s about a man on a journey of self discovery and the lessons learnt along the way. Lessons which are very applicable to all of our lives. The character interactions, development and world-building are some of the best I have ever seen. Of course the fights are well done, but you’ll find yourself being absorbed into the story and characters in a way that rarely happens.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, if you’re a fan of GOT, history, seinen, anime with character driven stories and historical dramas, you will love Vinland. It is undoubtedly the new anime of the year and with WIT seemingly not doing SNK season 4, should be their new crown jewel.<br />

    The first arc of Vinland Saga has been touted as one of manga’s greatest prologues. As such, many were curious about how well the anime would fare. While it may seem like a mere revenge story at first, this 24-episode series acts as a GAR infused yet slow-burning meditation on vengeance and war, as well as the thrills and horrors that await. Moreover, it&#039;s a character study revolving around the arc&#039;s main protagonists: Thorfinn and Askeladd. They make up the tragic backbone of the show, and that backbone is powerful enough to cement this show as one of the best of the year.<br />
<br />
Visually, this show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325213">
        is both better and worse than one might think. The CG ships and occasional CG humans are enough to set alarm bells off, and their prevalence would help spell the death of lesser productions in terms of quality. Even this show can look terrible at times, since not every episode is as detailed as one another and some make use of awkward CG environments way more than others. Sometimes the animation can really falter, leading to jank frame rate issues like in two critical moments of episode 4, or just a few really terrible sequences. However, director Shuuhei Yabuta has improved significantly from his last full directorial work, Inuyashiki. On top of that, Studio Wit tends to make anime with worthwhile production values, and he’s been their main man when it comes to CG for years. He knows what he’s doing, and it shows more often than not. Some big scenes lack the weight they should, but Vinland is so chock full of them that Yabuta’s given plenty of chances to add a visceral sense of weight and detail into several of the more explosive or otherwise powerful scenes. Seeing Thorfinn’s face in great detail as he huffs in seething rage for the first time or witnessing the sheer impact of Thorkell punching a horse into the air made for some of the craziest moments of the year. Those aren’t even the more tremendous moments he gets to adapt from this arc, either. Some camera movements such as the few first-person perspective 3D sequences are also eye-catching. Even more impressive is the artwork. Most of the time, it’s incredibly detailed, almost on the level of something like the Gundam Origin OVAs or the 1995 Ghost in the Shell movie. The art direction also leads to some stunning environments, like the horizons of Iceland or the golden crops of Vinland. Combined with Shuuhei Yabuta’s direction, some of these sequences that bask in the environments become breathtaking. A lot of the fight scenes have their incredible, weighty moments as well such as the first half of the fight between Askeladd and Thorfinn’s father in episode 4. The show straddles the line between looking amazing and looking terrible disturbingly often, which is a shame since without some of the jarring dips in quality here and there and with superior (or no) CG, the show would be one of the most well-produced anime of the year by far.<br />
<br />
The music is also a bit complicated. Yukata Yamada does provide a rather decent score for this anime, with a fair number of emotional pieces and early medieval tunes that often serve as highlights from the very beginning. The tracklist does seem a bit limited as evidenced by how the anime likes to make constant use of one singular piano track for most of the emotional scenes in the show. There are multiple piano tracks so some of them might even be used interchangeably. Additionally, a lot of pieces don’t quite feel tailor-made for this show or setting and instead feel like tracks that could have gone to any other dramatic title. The few that do feel perfect for the setting are not only some of the greatest tracks in the show but are unfortunately rarely used outside of the first quarter of the anime. I don’t mean to be too pessimistic with the soundtrack since there are still several nice tracks present, but the show ends up throwing a lot of them by the wayside and the ones the show uses more than a couple times don’t feel like they add a sense of identity to the show like say, Kaguya-sama’s OST did this year or like other fantastic OSTs such as Berserk 1997’s do for their shows. The first opening is honestly no better, feeling like a generic j-rock song with forced and hideous sounding screamo towards the end. It’s my least favorite piece of music in this entire show. The second opening, “Dark Crow” by MAN WITH A MISSION is a far more hype opening, with the wake-up call of the bagpipes at the beginning, and a rockin’ tone throughout. The first ED, “Torches” by Aimer, is a decently calming and pleasant enough piece, though it doesn’t feel as impactful with its chorus as I would have liked. The second ED, “Drown” by Milet, is more emotional and impactful, and it’s probably one of my favorite ending themes of the year. It’s perfect for the explosion of tremendous emotional moments and character development that is the second half of the show.<br />
<br />
The first few episodes of the show center around how the last stand of Thorfinn’s father, Thors, as well as the different phases of his upbringing before and after that moment, affect Thorfinn. He always had the potential for violence, after all, he and his people practiced war games all the time as they waited for the day they could finally join a war. However, he was still a child at heart, so seeing him turn from that innocent boy to an angsty killing machine is devastating. Few moments hurt quite as bad as the moment he resigns to his fate and accepts how horrible the path he takes is going to be in episode 6. That sigh of resignation seeing someone he hurt who genuinely wanted him to live the life of a boy again, and how that reminded him of the family he’s sure he’ll never see again, is a brilliant capstone to the first quarter of the show. Many have levied criticism of how stagnant he becomes in later episodes, as his single-minded drive to honorably kill Askeladd dominates his character. However, there are a few points worth bringing up to argue against that notion. He still has plenty of moments to be more than just that kind of person, like during his interactions with the then scared and reserved prince Canute, where he teases him halfway into the series. He’s not like Hajime from Arifureta or anything. He also thinks about how far he’s fallen from his father’s ideals, agonizing over how much worse he’s become since the man’s death despite how much he refuses to admit it to anyone else. His dreams and hallucinations are well-crafted reminders of his humanity and folly. These factors, as well as his stagnant nature, also serve as a form of tragedy. Not only is he painfully aware that he could drop this and not continually sully the message of the man he ultimately idolized, but he also serves as a reflection of who his target of hatred, Askeladd, used to be.<br />
<br />
By the time the halfway mark rolls around, Askeladd becomes the true star of the show. He’s long since grown past the vengeful killer he was as a child and has become a cunning man of ambition. He is the epitome of the glorious side of the show, with his glorious cackles being the cherry on top of each crazy plan that gets executed. He’s a proper magnificent bastard who would honestly be a standout character even if he were just a glorious, over the top schemer with a strong personality. However, he’s far more than just that, both as a foil to Thorfinn and as a person in his own right. Each reveal about why he became the man he is, about his feelings towards everyone around him, and about why he sees something in both Canute and Thorfinn, adds more to his personality and his journey throughout the series. To spoil his journey any further would do you a disservice, but let it be known that he is easily the richest character in the entire show, and my favorite character to have been introduced to the anime landscape this year.<br />
<br />
There are other noteworthy characters beyond just the main two. The aforementioned Canute has a surprisingly natural and tactile sense of progression when it comes to his development, and even when he’s still in nervous prince mode, he has a few cute interactions courtesy of Thorfinn teasing him. Thorfinn’s father, Thors, leaves a lasting impression for someone who only lasts for 4 episodes and whose death is used as the sole motivator behind Thorfinn’s revenge quest. One might think of him as just this perfect ultra badass dad who’s so good he doesn’t need to kill because that’s just wrong. He’s also a bit of an oaf at times, like when he can’t fix a pot and complains about it being too hard or when he’s too nervous to properly tell his wife to tell his kids that he loves them when he departs. He certainly has this brick shithouse giga chad vibe that the series exploits to great effect in the early episodes, but it’s the little things and how his actions affect the likes of Thorfinn and Askeladd during his final moments that make him surprisingly compelling. Another minor character from the early part, Ylva, is one of the more fun takes on the beleaguered teenage daughter and big sister character. She&#039;s one of the more entertaining and comedic characters of the early part along with Leif Erikson. In fact, seeing what she does following the death of her dad and disappearance of her little brother is perhaps the most compelling part of the 5th episode. Leif himself is even more humorous as the sort of adventurous and sarcastic goofball before the fourth episode changes him and steels his resolve for when he reappears later towards the end of the series. There are more characters that get similar levels of detail and charming presentation, including some of Askeladd’s Vikings and the larger than life ax-wielding maniac, Thorkell. There are other characters who get their own powerful emotional moments. However, this review would drag on and risk containing critical spoilers if I continued. <br />
<br />
The slow-burn narrative is a deeply somber one. Several episodes subject the viewer to horrifying village raids, the most soul-rending of which occurs in episode 14 which features a girl struggling with her faith before watching her entire village get slaughtered. There are many impactful deaths throughout as well starting from the death of Thors. Almost every major death is handled brilliantly. Thorfinn’s character is a miserable one as he laments the death of his father and his deals as Thorfinn kills and kills in a series of raids and wars. Everyone is richly characterized as people, adding further weight to the tragedy of the many deaths of the show and how people cannot simply be described as allies or enemies as if it were a black and white matter. Thors was right, and he died proving that fact and getting his murderer to spare the lives of everyone who accompanied him. There are plenty of glorious moments, like the entirety of episode 7 or some of the major developments characters go through later on. There are several epic battles between GAR as hell Vikings whose feats live up to the kinds of tales that real-life Vikings and villagers from this show’s time period boasted about and wrote into mythological canon. However, even with characters whose might rivals the likes of Beowulf himself, the show never forgets that they are people engulfed in war, and that there are many tragedies and atrocities that come with that kind of territory. Victories are grand but also fleeting, and even the most painfully meticulous and drawn-out plan Askeladd comes up with that lasts the entire third quarter of the show, is filled with sorrows before paying off spectacularly.<br />
<br />
Are there errors? Sure. Some of the dialogue reeks of words and phrases that could have never existed in the time period the show takes place in. Sometimes water doesn&#039;t react to anything moving in it and there are some animation errors. The CGI is pretty terrible. The anime original scenes in the 5th and 6th episodes as well as towards the end aren’t quite as good as most of the adapted material. Thanks to every bit of dialogue being written and spoken in one language, it’s a tad jarring when characters apparently switch languages. The 7th episode should have been the first episode as it loses some of its hype when following up one of the most somber moments in the entire show, and it would have better conveyed what the show was going to be from the beginning than the current first 4 episodes do. However, barring that last one being a potential reason for many being disappointed in Thorfinn’s character and how Vinland puts other ideas and plots above its revenge story plot, none of these are significant issues. How can they be with characters this expertly written and writing this incredibly presented? Even if the audiovisuals are a bit inconsistent and not as great as they could have been, they still support most of the show’s incredible moments. Even if there are lulls here and there, the show’s characters and payoffs more than make up for it. Nothing is going to stop Vinland Saga from being one of 2019’s greatest, not with a core and finale as powerful as this.<br />

    Honestly, I don&#039;t get why this anime is hyped. Perhaps the manga readers are hyped by whatever stories that aren&#039;t animated yet, but as a non-manga reader at episode 6, Vinland Saga barely met the threshold for mediocrity.<br />
<br />
The art is uninspiring, the blend between CGI and traditionally drawn art is abysmal, the poor use of soundtracks failed to augment the emotional element of the story. What exactly is special about this anime?<br />
<br />
Perhaps the premise of a Viking story is new (for animes, at least), but a fresh premise alone can&#039;t carry the whole show. While there are some plot points in the first six episodes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315438">
        that are clearly meant to tug at your heartstrings, the abysmal execution just ruins the experience. <br />
<br />
For me, it felt like I was shown a great advertisement for a burger, listing all the correct ingredients etc., but the execution was so bad, it made me wish I never got hyped up by the ad to begin with. Nothing feels more disappointing to an anime viewer than when the story is clearly trying to be &quot;touching&quot; or &quot;emotionally affecting&quot; but the scenes just fall short and end up bland.<br />
<br />
Sorry guys, it&#039;s a solid 5 for me.

    [Paragraphs that contain spoilers have been marked]<br />
<br />
I was hyped for Vinland Saga, more hyped than I’d been for any anime the whole year. I even waited for all episodes to air before binging the show because considering the things I’d heard about it, I knew I wouldn’t be able to stop once I started watching it. It definitely did live up to the hype and I enjoyed the hell out of it, but I did find few pacing issues among other problems. <br />
<br />
[Story and World]<br />
<br />
Vinland Saga is a show about Vikings. You know those horned helmets wearing, axe wielding, wine drinking badasses who discovered America?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325199">
        Considering anime now-a-days usually follows the formula of having cute chibi characters and tossing them into dangerous situations, Vinland Saga was a breath of fresh air. It’s been a while since I saw adults as the prominent cast in an anime. The last good anime with a mostly adult cast, Golden Kamuy, aired way back in January 2018. Not saying that anime having a main cast comprising of children and teens is bad, but I’m getting off topic. <br />
<br />
Vinland Saga has a great cast of characters, a great story interweaving personal and impersonal, political and non-political, religious and non-religious narratives, amazing world building, great writing and awesome animation as the icing on the cake. We follow Thorfinn, son of Thors, as he is on a quest to fulfill his vendetta against Askeladd. That’s all I can say about the plot without spoiling anything.<br />
<br />
The story is set in 1000 AD during the English invasion of Denmark. The show does an immaculate job of portraying the environment of that era. The attention to detail is astonishing. From huge ships with heads shaped like dragons to the smallest of details on a coin everything is proof of the love and care that was put into creating Vinland Saga. You can feel the author’s passion for history in the veracity of the architecture, in the aerial view of cities and battle camps, in the clothes and jewelry that people wear and last but not least in the politics and the characters who are derived from historical figures who existed in the same era. <br />
<br />
[Characters]<br />
<br />
Superficially, Vinland Saga may seem like a story about the violence, atrocities and other events that took place due to the war between the English and the Danes, but it is first and foremost a character drama. We have a vast array of extremely well characterized cast which does not limit itself to the main group of characters. Thorfinn and Askeladd’s dynamic is one of the best, if not the best character dynamic, I had the pleasure witnessing in recent years. <br />
<br />
This happens pretty early in the show so I wouldn’t consider it a spoiler, but if you’re the kind of person who wants to go into a show blind, then skip the next paragraph. <br />
------------------------------------------------------Spoilers Start----------------------------------------------------<br />
Thorfinn’s father, Thors, is called by one of his old comrades to join the war and he reluctantly agrees. During their journey to the battlefield Thors’ ship is attacked by pirates led by Askeladd, who was tasked with killing Thors. Thors is murdered by Askeladd in front of Thorfinn and thus starts Thorfinn’s quest for vendetta. <br />
<br />
Thorfinn, 6 years old at the time of his father’s murder, sets out on his goal of killing Askeladd despite his father’s best efforts in his last moments to try to steer Thorfinn away from the path of revenge. But Thorfinn, driven by instincts and emotion and wanting to quench his thirst for vengeance, disregards his father’s words.<br />
<br />
Thorfinn joins Askeladd’s group of pirates in order to earn a chance to duel him and Askeladd, while at first exploiting Thorfinn’s anger and using it for his own merit, slowly but surely starts to respect Thorfinn’s determination. This is how one of the best character dynamic starts developing between a boy and his father’s killer. <br />
------------------------------------------------------Spoilers End----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Thorfinn is a good character but he may seem pretty one-dimensional at times as his motivation for all he does is to gain a chance to duel and kill Askeladd. He doesn’t receive much development this season and that’s perfectly fine. I’d rather have a character develop slowly and persistently rather than having him change in a few episodes. We do see Thorfinn’s struggles and thus growth as he transforms from a sweet little boy into a vicious killer even though that’s the farthest thing from what his father would’ve wanted. <br />
<br />
Askeladd is the most interesting character to come out of any anime this year. He’s ruthless, plunders villages and kills the villagers for food and money, he’s a shrewd scheming bastard and yet I couldn’t help but like him. He has a kind of mysterious aura to himself to which we get insight later in the show and when you consider what kind of person he is and the life he’s led you can make sense of why he treats Thorfinn, a kid who’s out to kill him, with respect. Askeladd thinks he owes a debt to Thors which he can never repay directly and thus tries to repay it vicariously through Thorfinn. <br />
<br />
There are many other characters who play a pivotal role in this season, some of them include: Thorkell; Canute, the prince of Denmark; Floki, one of Thors’ old comrades and few more. <br />
<br />
Canute is the prince of Denmark, but he’s quite effeminate for a prince. He is a pacifist despite being raised by a Viking and he is a religious Christian. All this changes drastically however, after certain events unfold and he turns into a figure much reminiscent of a prince; but I thought the development happened too quickly and was rushed. I’m not stating that he shouldn’t have undergone change, but a steadier change would’ve been less jarring and would’ve had a larger impact on the audience in the long run. Still, watching him become more sophisticated after witnessing war and being imbued by a philosophy which was very different to his own was goosebumps material.<br />
<br />
Thorkel is a character whom I, at first, thought of as Goku because he loves is eating and fighting strong opponents, but he turned out to be a much more introspective person. The characters are great and are a great addition to the already rich world of Vinland Saga.<br />
<br />
Another aspect of what I loved about Vinland Saga was the portrayal of religion. Episode 14 is probably my favourite episode of anything that deals with the faith that people hold on to in desperate times and the message the episode was trying to get across was depressing but beautiful at the same time. <br />
<br />
[Music and Animation]<br />
<br />
The animation is absolutely fantastic. There is some weird use of CG here and there, but the character animation and the backgrounds, especially the backgrounds, are magnificently animated. The picturesque scenery portraying all mountain ranges and the snowy landscape of Iceland was breathtaking. The hilly areas and the mountainous terrain of Wales was aptly displayed for maximum immersion.  The titular world – Vinland – seemed like it was something out of a Ghibli anime. <br />
<br />
The character animation is just as good. Expressions of anger, sadness, regret are properly encapsulated. The fights are fluid and flow like water with not sudden jump cuts or weird framing. <br />
<br />
The music was also good. I especially loved the first opening and the first ending songs. The second opening and ending tracks are amazing, just not as good at capturing the tone of the show. The tracks used during the episodes were well suited for the show and properly conveyed the emotion in a scene.<br />
<br />
[Cons]<br />
<br />
1.	As I explained, Canute’s development was a bit too quick.<br />
<br />
2.	The pacing was a bit slow in the middle segment of the show. It didn’t drag, but the change from the earlier parts of the show was noticeable.<br />
<br />
3.	Now, this is my biggest problem with the show. Some of the fights are so unrealistic that it feels like a power fantasy at times. I can already hear the distant, “It’s an anime so it doesn’t matter” argument, but it does matter. Why? Because it breaks immersion. <br />
<br />
You feel like you’re watching a show grounded in reality but then suddenly appears this huge dude who yeets an axe across the battlefield killing 4 men in one strike. This guy, Thorkell, throws a spear as far as 500m and impales 5 guys without the spear losing any momentum. <br />
<br />
I mean I understand that Vikings were tall, sturdy and strong, but a guy picking up what seems like a 200kg boulder with ease and yeeting it at ships is pushing the realm of believability. <br />
<br />
4.	The language barrier is portrayed weirdly. This didn’t really detract from my enjoyment but was a bit confusing at first. <br />
<br />
So, there are two prominent language spoken in the show, Nordic and English, and both are spoken in Japanese. So, in this one scene Thorfinn is talking in Nordic (in spoken Japanese) to some French soldiers and the soldiers can’t understand him because they only speak French. Then, the French soldiers reply in Japanese which is supposed to be French and then it all develops into a convoluted mess. As I said it’s not a major problem, just a little confusing.<br />
<br />
[Tl;dr]<br />
<br />
Vinland Saga is definitely one of the best anime among those that came out in recent years and is probably the best of the year but that’s up for debate. It’s not a show that shies away from ever looming feelings death and despair that people deal with during war. Nothing is sugarcoated or hidden under a veil of hopefulness, but the brutality and viciousness of war and the effect it has on people is laid out in plain sight. <br />
<br />
But it’s not the murders, rape or the atrocities committed by the warring factions that hit the hardest, what hits the hardest is the poignant reality of how a child treads the very path that his father tried to steer him away from. What hits the hardest is the sadness a mother feels after being betrayed by someone whom she treated like her own child. <br />
<br />
What I think this season is, is a prologue to a much larger and much grander tale; what the Golden Age Arc is to Berserk, this season is to Vinland Saga. Is it perfect? No, but then again, nothing is. <br />

    I just don&#039;t get what the appeal of this show could be.<br />
<br />
First, let&#039;s get this out of the way: I fucking hate the &#039;Historical&#039; tag. Every time I see the Historical tag, I get fooled into thinking the show is realistic. After all, you&#039;d assume that something that is &#039;historical&#039; would be true to history. Even working with the lax definition of &quot;set in the past&quot;, you&#039;d still expect a sense of realism. Yet every time without fail, I am continuously disappointed. Instead of being set in the past, every &#039;Historical&#039; show is set in an alternate universe&#039;s past—one in which any bullshit is excusable

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316435">
        (after all, it&#039;s anime!). This is fine in shows like Baccano and Kuroshitsuji, where the historical aspect isn&#039;t that relevant. The lack of realism in Vinland Saga, however, is a massive stab in the back. The action scenes are boring as fuck due to a lack of cool superpowers, so you&#039;d assume the show would want to present itself as something realistic. But no, the very next second, some chad singlehandedly beats dozens of armed men with his bare hands, a kid somehow kills an adult soldier with a knife, these dudes literally sprint at really high speeds while carrying a SHIP on their backs, and some dude throws an ax, decapitating four people in a row. The fights are boring due to realism, yet they are ruined due to... a lack of realism? It&#039;s almost like the show is having an identity crisis and doesn&#039;t know what it&#039;s supposed to be. That&#039;s not my biggest problem with the &#039;Historical&#039; tag, however. My biggest problem is that I was fooled into thinking I would get to watch an interesting show, only to be presented a generic battle shounen (despite what the Seinen tag may suggest) with a slight twist to its setting.<br />
<br />
The plot is ingenious. This dude&#039;s dad gets killed by this other guy, so now the dude is traveling with the other guy to get revenge. Except the dude spends more time helping the other guy out than he does getting revenge. Cool. <br />
<br />
Since there is no plot, you&#039;d think the characters have to be good, right? After all, there has to be a reason this pile of trash gets near-unanimous praise. Well, fuck you haha! We&#039;ve got the worst main character I&#039;ve seen since Takumi Nishijou, some dude who can only be described with the word &quot;cool&quot;, and then the MC&#039;s dad who is just a naive degenerate. Thank god that dude died due to his mindnumbing stupidity! Dude unironically thought a pirate would keep the promise of a duel, and then when his son got taken hostage because, well, you&#039;re up against pirates, he just let himself die. What a genius! Is there any trope more obnoxious than self-righteous, moral high ground characters like these? &quot;If you kill your enemies, you&#039;re as bad as them!&quot; Fuck off. You live in the Viking age, not the 21st century.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, Thorfinn must be the most obnoxious anime character ever made. He was already annoying as fuck as a little kid, but his grown-up version is 10x worse. &quot;My dad died, so since I&#039;m traumatized by that, I have to be SUPER edgy! I have to go &quot;grrrrrrrrr&quot; and look angry whenever I am on screen, because I am angry that my dad died, and I want revenge. Grrrrrrrr!&quot; Other than that, the dude has no personality whatsoever. The dude doesn&#039;t even speak unless it&#039;s to say something extremely edgy that sounds like it came straight out of a conversation in The Perfect Insider. Where are all those people who hate how edgy Akame ga Kill and Mirai Nikki are when you need them?<br />
<br />
And then we&#039;ve got Askeladd, who is some weird fusion between F/Z Gilgamesh and the protagonist of Arifureta. He is what would be created if you told a 12-year-old to make a cool character. I can see why this is one of the best shows in the past decade. Definitely.<br />
<br />
The sound has also shocked me—and not in a good way. Yutaka Yamada, the guy who made Tokyo Ghoul&#039;s soundtrack (which is one of my all-time favorite anime soundtracks) is finally back in another relevant show, and.... the result is quite forgettable. Like, the OST is just... average. On the other hand, the OP is impressive. Not only is it an overall great song, but it also matches the show well. That part where the dude screams his lungs out with no warning pretty much exactly describes Thorfinn. The ED must be the only Aimer song that I have ever disliked.<br />
<br />
Now, let&#039;s get to the art section. There are three points to make here:<br />
<br />
1. Episode 1 looks stunning<br />
2. Everything after that doesn&#039;t<br />
3. The CGI is a 1/10<br />
<br />
Seriously, how are we in 2019, two years after the release of Houseki no Kuni (which still features the best use of CGI in anime), and big-name studios with massive budgets like Wit are pumping out such horrendous CGI? You&#039;d think they&#039;d learn how much bad CGI can ruin a show after Overlord III got released, but no, they never do. What&#039;s even worse is the blending between the 2D and the CGI. It&#039;s legitimately disturbing.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the animation and art are pretty good. Unfortunately, unlike a good battle shounen, Kimetsu no Yaiba (which is also made by a good studio, ufotable), Vinland Saga has been unable to maintain its level of visual quality. Pretty much every episode the animation dips in quality. It has, in its eight episodes so far, went from 10/10 animation to 7/10 animation. The 2D art, however, stays really good throughout.<br />
<br />
And so, I&#039;ll end this review by quoting the current top review for this show. &quot;Are you interested in Vikings and Norse mythology? [Do y]ou want stunning animated action scenes? Good [world-building]? Great character development?&quot; Well, if you do, look somewhere else. This pretty much isn&#039;t about Vikings due to its lack of realism. This is as much about Vikings as DanMachi is about mythology. The &quot;stunning animated action scenes&quot; don&#039;t exist past episode one. The world-building is alright at best. The character development is laughable. I simply don&#039;t understand why people like Zombieland Saga (haha get it they both have &#039;Saga&#039; in their names haha comedy gold!). Nothing about it is outstanding—not even the production values.

    Greetings ladies and gentlemen, I will cut straight to the point. <br />
<br />
Have you ever experienced a work with an intriguing premise capable of appealing to you… being undermined by a plethora of flaws and handled half-heartedly?<br />
<br />
Vinland Saga is such a case. I do not consider this to be a great anime, let alone the AoTY; for all (or actually, because of) my love of medieval history, I couldn’t resist reviewing this too ambitious-for-its-own-good work.<br />
<br />
Note: this work may contain spoilers, at the final section for the plot.<br />
<br />
[1. Starting with the visuals]<br />
<br />
(-) The animation is simply put, lackluster. Audaciously lackluster.<br />
<br />
And it shows early: at the first episode

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325208">
        we are shown a flashback to a naval battle where Thors (the protagonist’s father) participates, based on the Battle of Hjörungavágr. Immediately, we are greeted with ugly CGI. For example, water does not feel natural at all, but rather as some industrial sludge. <br />
<br />
This gets worse during later parts, for CGI utterly fails to not stand out like a sore thumb at animated sequences. The blending of hand-drawn animation with CGI is poor, with certain sequences having a rather unnatural feel. One of my biggest complaints though has to do with abusing stills and limited animation.<br />
<br />
Before presenting examples, I want to say this loud and clear: I do NOT look down on any animation techniques, but here the execution is full of eyesores and inexcusable. When decent CGI is featured on Land of the Lustrous or when Kill la Kill uses limited animation to save budget while oozing originality, I find it odd that WIT failed to achieve harmony. The production often screamed sloppiness and cutting down costs rather than presenting something worth its hype. <br />
<br />
Anyway, at the aforementioned battle we are treated to an aerial view shot of miniature toy soldiers “fighting” on longboats… resembling sequences in some B-grade browser strategy game. With these longboats floating on the aforementioned CGI sludge.<br />
<br />
Concerning limited animation and stills, they are abused for crowds, the result being jarring and ill-fitting. Mostly in duels, but is rather commonplace for enemies to be frozen in place before getting slaughtered by characters forcibly being established as master fighters. <br />
<br />
(+) The art is not perfect, and in fact, can feel bland and drained of detail.<br />
<br />
Examples include longboats, distant crowds, fortifications, armor, etc. They often lack eye candy and polish and the palette feels too “worn out”, despite the fact plain colors can draw the best qualities out of the historical genre.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, I include art in the positive aspect for two reasons. First of all, each person depicted has a different build, clothing and facial features, including freckles and scars.  The second is the backgrounds. Whether an Icelandic settlement wracked by the elements, the town of York or a mountainous passage in Wales, there is a plethora of gorgeous landscapes that caught my eye.<br />
<br />
[2.About the audio sector] <br />
<br />
I won’t say much, despite valuing sound direction, voice acting and music a lot. I’m mostly content, though I would prefer a more medieval-sounding OST rather than one fitting for a stock shonen.<br />
<br />
Characters from different peoples were supposed to be unable to communicate, but all lines are in Japanese. I recall the first chapter featuring Franks speaking in (nonetheless modern) French when in the presence of Norsemen, to portray this. An understandable break from reality, given how difficult it would be to include lines in Welsh, Old Norse, etc. But it still seemed odd.<br />
<br />
[3. On to the non-production factors, starting with characters] <br />
<br />
(-) I’m either neutral or dislike most of them. <br />
<br />
Thorfinn is a flat revenge story protagonist: being obsessed, brooding and resentful are his sole traits. He is static, never takes notice of the surrounding environment to contemplate and thus is easily manipulated. Thorkell is mighty and larger than life. Given the setting and his culture, his character somewhat fits but to an extend also ruins the tone; multiple sequences and lines are straight from B-grade action films, one of the worst offenders being his debut at the first episode. Still, the ones that left me with the sourest of impressions are Thors and Canute, enough to include separate explanations at the plot section. <br />
<br />
(+) Despite my distaste for multiple characters, one fascinated me deeply: Askeladd, the deuteragonist. <br />
<br />
He is a ruthless and callous commander but also compelling, being calculated and abusing obfuscating blitheness to take advantage of his enemies’ carelessness. But this is only the peak of the iceberg, as we are gradually shown more fascinating facets (e.g. being a “stealth mentor” and a person forged by tragedy). He is also morally myopic and commits multiple atrocities, but this makes him more than a mere villain or anti-hero, he is over half of the show’s magic.<br />
<br />
Askeladd aside, I believe some side characters served their selected roles well. One of them is King Sweyn, whom I deem fit as an aged and jaded ruler.<br />
<br />
[4.And, let’s conclude with the plot] <br />
<br />
<br />
(a.) “A true warrior does not need a sword.” – Thors.<br />
<br />
First arc: as you may understand, I am not fond of its start. However, the production is not the sole issue: it’s the presence of Thors.<br />
<br />
After the naval battle, we are treated to Thors living with his family in Iceland as settlers. Because of a conflict of interest, a landowner and his retainers arrive and we are treated to interesting historical elements: slavery and the workings of a commodity economy. Thors established himself as unlike his peers; he shuns violence and favors negotiations, even for no practical gain and much for the village to lose. The problem is, it makes zero sense to display such morality more in line with modern pacifism. It is simply not convincing in such a warlike honor-based society, and during these turbulent ages. <br />
<br />
My bewilderment is summed up by the aforementioned phrase. What on earth is its meaning? If you are not willing to take up arms and be cautious, you may end up enslaved, raped, tortured and/or killed. And this is a fact, no presence or enforcement of any form of international law back then.<br />
<br />
What really ticked me off however was the event that kick started the revenge arc: rather than brush aside his morals to defend nail and tooth his own son and kinsmen, Thors resorts to punching and preaching to a bunch of pirates, whose leader is willing to exploit anything and anyone for the sake of his goals. <br />
<br />
Everyone could end up dead or worse, if it wasn’t for the leader’s personal morality. The outcome to this clash ends as a disgrace entirely because of the context. It is an insult to my intelligence, and too convenient.<br />
<br />
The rest of the arc is about the relationship of Thorfinn and Askeladd, as well the Danish invasion on England, following St. Brice&#039;s Day massacre, concluding with a battle for London. <br />
<br />
The point of view is focused on the Norsemen, the Anglo-Saxons being treated as either naïve civilians or soldiers ready to die en masse.  One positive aspect is presenting samples of Norse culture, such as whaling and the Laugardagr. I also liked how a siege at France was included in an episode.<br />
A negative aspect was the presence of pop and Japanese culture references; a moving Star Wars reference, the protagonist Naruto-running and others, this trend continuing to the second arc, without contributing to anything. Another example is right below.<br />
<br />
(b.) “Battle isn’t the same as Shogi.” – Askeladd.<br />
<br />
Second arc: I prefer this arc by far, yet also has issues of its own. I was mostly content with the plot; a conflict of faiths, legitimate elements of values dissonance, plus insight on the history of the British Isles. There were even clever tactical elements.<br />
<br />
This arc introduces Canute, based on Cnut the Great, for whom I will not pretend that I know everything. Whatever I judge is according to the anime. After a certain event and a trial of related hardships, Canute needs development, being established as a fragile young man who loathed violence. Disappointingly, this turned into a total disaster: rather than make the process gradual and natural, the creator decides to exploit an outrageous plot device.<br />
<br />
He dreams, apparently receives enlightenment, is given a Christian lecture on the true meaning of love (i.e. on agape) and makes a 180 degree turn. Why is this outrageous? Because it is a blatantly supernatural asspull, not convincing or realistic and on top of that, preachy. Canute’s transition towards a charismatic and gallant leader is too sudden, and infuriatingly poorly written. Even worse, the same preaching is used to excuse Thors’ morality; on top of him being constantly praised as the best warrior, this bothered me to no end.<br />
<br />
Negativity aside, the last episodes are amazing. From skullduggery and political intrigue, to one blast of a conclusion, they actually brought a smile to my face.  If anything, these episodes are a reason for which I haven’t rated Vinland Saga lower.

    So. Vinland Saga. Where do I even begin? Cards on the table, I&#039;m almost certain this is a masterpiece in the making and that anyone who sleeps on it is going to regret it.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m here to tell you, if you&#039;re on the fence about giving this show a shot: Do it. It&#039;s worth it.<br />
<br />
If you gave it a try and found the first couple episodes didn&#039;t grab you initially: Stick with it. It&#039;s worth it.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a fan of the original manga who&#039;s unsure about retreading old ground or you&#039;re fearful at what an anime might do to sully the perfection of your precious, precious

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315130">
        baby: Rest assured. It&#039;s worth it.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re squeamish about a series exploring all the lovely topics associated with vikings including murder, pillaging, slavery, and sexual assault in a way that is unflinching in its portrayal of brutality but doesn&#039;t use it to gratuitous effect: Maybe try to push past it for the sake of a compelling narrative but take care of yourself first and foremost and know that a good show or a great one isn&#039;t worth your health. Drink some water. Pet an animal. Give this one a pass with my blessing and feel no guilt or shame in putting yourself before some Chinese cartoons.<br />
<br />
Full disclosure, I benefit from having the entire source material available at this time under my belt, so while it will definitely sway my opinions of the series going forward since I&#039;m not going in completely blind, new fans will still find this very enjoyable. With a series like this, it&#039;s very easy to let the overwhelming hype heighten your expectations past a reasonable level only to be let down.<br />
<br />
This is not that type of show.<br />
<br />
Or at least, for me it wasn&#039;t, because I was initially immune to the hype. I&#039;d passed up on Vinland Saga before this. I knew about it only in the vaguest sense and ignored recommendations to give it a chance. I dismissed it as a violent gorefest for dudebros obsessed with Preserving Western Values, one that prioritized pandering to the exact type of person who&#039;s a little too interested in sweeping proclamations about his proud warrior heritage in this day and age. I went into the first episode of the anime with a vague sense of disinterest but a willingness to be impressed.<br />
<br />
One episode, and I was intrigued. Two episodes, and I was invested. Three episodes, I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on the manga so I could see how the set-up would conclude. I tore through 160+ chapters at record speed and I&#039;m a willing convert here to spread the good word that we&#039;re in for a wild ride if all goes well. Tears will be shed. Fists will be pumped. Conceptions will be challenged and layers will be uncovered.<br />
<br />
But that&#039;s all future predictions. What about right now? Well, this early on, we&#039;ve got some beautiful worldbuilding, breathtaking scenery, and characters who, while not extremely fleshed out just yet, do have hints of hidden depths just begging to be explored. The voice work that goes into bringing these characters to life is impeccable, with special mention going to our main character&#039;s child voice actress for an absolutely chilling performance in the fourth episode. We&#039;re encouraged to see this world through the eyes of its protagonist: equal parts idyllic and exciting, where the simplicity of childhood clashes with a cold dose of reality that comes knocking at the front door and bringing with it an end to the notion that adventure waits just around the corner for the brave and pure of heart.<br />
<br />
Poetry aside, life&#039;s a real kick in the teeth, and whether it&#039;s the present day or the 11th century, that ain&#039;t changing. What, were you expecting a happy show? It&#039;s heavy and at times emotionally draining, yes, but carries with it a kernel of hope that grows as the narrative progresses onward. This series aims to deconstruct the bog-standard motivation of vengeance before reason, honor before morality, and warrior pride before compassion and empathy.<br />
<br />
Now, to moderate expectations: You may not be impressed by the pacing. Vinland Saga is a sprawling epic that takes places over the span of 17 years and counting, and it takes its time getting to where it needs to go in the beginning. It thoroughly fleshes out its world and makes it feel truly lived-in, with anime-original scenes to keep the manga readers on their toes and fill in the gaps left by the source material. This is not a show with blazing fast traction, it&#039;s a slow burn, and it&#039;s one of the best examples I&#039;ve seen in anime to date. We start out with our protagonist as a young child and stick with him throughout the entirety of his journey into adulthood, which means we&#039;re not going to see the full brunt of an unstoppable killing machine right away.<br />
<br />
Some people (like me) really jell with this kind of methodical, thoughtful pace, but others might be bored to tears and just want to see some guys hack pieces off of one another like god intended. I urge you to settle down and let the story unfold. Be patient. It&#039;s coming, and it&#039;s worth the wait. (Or just read ahead in the manga like I did and spend the next several days stewing in a pool of your own tears, that works, too.)<br />
<br />
In the meantime, if you don&#039;t need a bloody battle every two minutes to keep your attention focused, you can instead feast your eyes on the beautiful artwork and animation, particularly the backgrounds. It&#039;s WIT Studio of Attack on Titan acclaim at the helm here, so it comes as no surprise that Vinland Saga is an audiovisual treat, but I found myself constantly taken aback by just how lovely it consistently was. Some of you might find the occasional CG jarring, but here it&#039;s used sparingly and effectively, so I had no issues with it whatsoever. Where the series really shines is its background artwork and its environments, how it makes everything feel vibrant and true to life. The sound design goes even further in selling the idea that we&#039;re really experiencing Europe from a thousand years ago. The music is unobtrusive when it needs to be and used to stunning effect in its most important scenes. From a purely technical standpoint, everything here is rock solid and builds a strong foundation for the story to build from.<br />
<br />
So, where does that leave us? While I think the Vinland Saga adaptation exceeds expectations and could turn out to be the overall best way of experiencing the narrative if its current quality holds up over the course of its run, the only way to know for sure if it&#039;s everything I&#039;ve promised is to experience it for yourself. Dedicate a solid hour and a half to let this show transport you into a bygone age set over a millennium ago, and if you walk away disappointed after that, no amount of throwing you against this wall is going to give you a breakthrough.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s no such thing as a story that&#039;s perfect for everyone, but for me, Vinland Saga was exactly what I needed it to be, and I can&#039;t overstate how eager I am to see where it takes me. I hope it does the same for you.

    Overview:<br />
<br />
Here it is folks! My vote for best anime of 2019. Vinland Saga is a faithful adaptation of the dark and brutal manga that took the internet by storm over a decade ago. Do you like Berserk? Do you like Rurouni Kenshin? Would you like to add Vikings to those 2 things and mix them all together? If so, then Vinland Saga is the anime for you!<br />
<br />
Vinland Saga takes place during the reign of Sweyn Forkbeard in the early 1000s. In the year 1002, King Æthelred the Unready made the disastrous decision to slaughter over 100 Danish settlers as revenge for Viking raids. The St.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325370">
        Brice&#039;s Day Massacre provoked Denmark into invading the British Isles, which would be conquered by Sweyn&#039;s son Cnut the Great.<br />
<br />
The first character we&#039;re introduced to is Thors the Troll. He is a mighty Viking warrior who has seen so much bloodshed that he eventually has an existential crisis and abandons the Vikings to live a pacifist life in Iceland. However, the peaceful times don&#039;t last. Thors is assassinated early in the series by a Viking raider named Askeladd. Thors&#039; son Thorfinn witnesses his father&#039;s murder and devotes his entire life to getting revenge on Askeladd. In order to do this, Thorfinn joins Askeladd&#039;s crew of ruthless killers and commits many atrocities. This is all so that one day he can challenge Askeladd to a duel and kill him using weapons that belonged to Thors.<br />
<br />
The plot of Vinland Saga reminds me a lot of Kenshin. You have a mix of historical accuracy with comic book superhuman feats and WAY over the top representations. Of course, exaggerated historical fiction is very old. A few examples would include the Three Musketeers and Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Even the Iliad was possibly based on a real world conflict and simply exaggerated with demi-gods, sea monsters, and dudes who&#039;re immortal unless they get stabbed in the heel. <br />
<br />
While the plot is amusing, it is the characters that make Vinland Saga my anime of the year. Firstly, lets look at our protagonist Thorfinn. This isn&#039;t your everyday anime hero. Thorfinn is a stupid, selfish bastard who kills hundreds of fathers to hopefully one day avenge his own. He spends virtually the entire series being rather unlikeable...and this is a good thing. American comic books are obsessed with the idea that the protagonist HAS to be likeable. This greatly limits the types of stories that they can possibly tell. American comics can&#039;t have epic scale, gradual redemption arcs because our publishers wouldn&#039;t accept Thorfinn as a main character. In order to find a Thorfinn in American comics, you have to go to underground indy comics like Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. In other words, cult comics with zero budget that will never be adapted.<br />
<br />
The best character in the series without question is Askeladd. This guy starts out as hateful as possible. He leads a band of killers that slaughters villages, rapes women, and tortures priests to death for the lulz. Only later do we find out that he has sympathetic motives! Askeladd joined the Vikings to get in good with them and try prevent an invasion of his native Wales. He tries to justify the atrocities to himself by saying that Anglos displaced the Celts and deserve what&#039;s coming to them. However, he&#039;s deeply disgusted by the things he has to do and despises himself as much as he despises his henchmen. Askeladd is certainly not a clear cut hero, but becomes sympathetic enough to become an unlikely anti-hero. If I had to select an anime &quot;Mt. Douchemore&quot; of loveable bastards it would have Askeladd, Oberstein, Joe Yabuki, and Lucy from Elfen Lied as the 4 faces.<br />
<br />
While Askeladd is the best character, my favorite character by FAR is Thorkell. This is a 10 foot tall giant who wins entire battles by himself. He is a killing machine, but doesn&#039;t kill with any sense of spite, anger, or hatred. He switches sides and fights against his fellow Vikings simply because he wanted a better challenge! In Thorkell&#039;s mind, dying on the battlefield is the best thing that can happen to someone. Those that die bravely get to enter the beerhall of the Gods in Valhalla and party forever! Thorkell sincerely believes that he&#039;s doing his victims a great favor, which makes his mass killings both chilling and oddly hilarious. &quot;Hey, who do you think would win: The Gods in Valhalla or this Jesus guy? I see that skinny Jesus always getting nailed to stuff and I just feel sorry for him!&quot; - Thorkell&#039;s informed opinions on religion.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The most controversial part of Vinland Saga definitely comes down to art and animation. While the character art is decently adapted from the manga, some of the detail of course gets lost. The animation is mostly solid, but also has some god awful CG that&#039;s highly distracting. At least the series cuts down on this after the first few episodes. I showed the first 3 episodes to a friend who doesn&#039;t watch anime very much and he started laughing when he saw the CG. That&#039;s just embarrassing for anime as an artform that modern anime graphics are comical to outsiders.<br />
<br />
Music and Sound:<br />
<br />
Yes, all the Icelandic, Danish, Norwegian, Welsh, and English people are speaking Japanese. Get over it. The soundtrack is pretty damn solid and both OPs get me PUMPED to watch more Viking violence!<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
I mean...I already said this is my anime of the year. I obviously love this series! However, my offline buddies weren&#039;t as enamored with it as I was. It can be jarring going from American Comics and their firm moral code to having protagonists like Thorfinn and Askeladd. While America loves violence, we specifically love righteous vengeance. That&#039;s NOT what Vinland Saga is about, so this anime seems to have limited appeal for American general audiences. If you&#039;re willing to keep an open mind though, Vinland Saga is an incredibly rewarding title and unlike any anime I&#039;ve seen come out in years!

2019 has been an interesting year for anime. It was the year that gave us such great shows like Dororo, Kaguya Sama Love is War, Beastars. High Score Girl 2, Skilled Teaser Takagi San 2 and The Promised Neverland but at the same time it gave such disasters like Fairy Gone, Domestic Girlfriend and The Seven Deadly Sins 3 done by Studio Deen. We also saw the positive decline of the isekai genre thanks to stuff like Isekai Cheat Magician, Arifureta: From Commonplace to World&#039;s Strongest, Wise Man Grandchild and that unbearable long isekai show that featured the MC

<br />
Needless to say, 2019 was a fun year for anime despite its various shortcomings.  Out of all the anime that aired in 2019 there was two anime that stood out from the crowd. Two series that managed to outshine every other anime of 2019 thanks to their superb writing, outstanding character development and excellent production values.<br />
<br />
The two anime in question are Fruits Basket 2019 and Vinland Saga.<br />
I have high expectations for theses since their annulments back in 2018, yet they managed to meet and surpass my expectations. <br />
If you haven&#039;t seen my Fruits Basket 2019 I recommend check it out as I go into detail what made that show amazing because this review will about Vinland Saga and how amazing it is.<br />
Establishing a world is one of the key components for any historical series to succeed and Vinland Saga completely nails it. I was blown away of how Vinland Saga established its world and chararters. The first 6 episodes do a great job at of setting up the tone, theme chararter motivation to the viewer.<br />
<br />
Which leads me to the story itself which is astonishing.<br />
<br />
The pacing is perfect from the slow but impactful first 6 that manages to establish is setting and character to the fast-paced Viking battles for the rest of the series.<br />
<br />
Vinland Saga is at heart a revenge story as well as a story about ageing.<br />
<br />
The revenge part of the story centres around Throfin trying to kill the person that led to his father&#039;s death. Through his journey we see him achieving and confiting his main goal. He would gladly follow Askeladd&#039;s orders just to have another duel with him even if it cost him his life from facing threatening foes that are experienced in combat. As the show progresses we see him slowly conflicting his main goal, especially after he learns about Askeladd backstory in episode 22.<br />
By the end of the show, you would begin to realize t revenge isn&#039;t the right source of action. Sure you have had the thrill of planning your revenge against someone but at what cost.  Did you have to abandon your sister and your fragile mother for the sake of revenge? Did you have to drastically change your personality for the sake of revenge? Do you still consider delivering the killing blow against the person after they told their backstory to you Vinland Saga is a great revenge story that makes you think?<br />
<br />
The ageing part of the story centres around Askeladd facing against time. I don&#039;t mean he&#039;s dying of illness but his body is slowly deteriorating him due to ageing. He has done so many things in his youth both good and bad and we see this with his past and conversation with the other characters. <br />
<br />
(Spoilers)<br />
One of the best moments in the show involves Askeladd and Bjorn fighting each other as a dying wish as a warrior for Bjorn due to an infection. It was a heartbreaking duel that perfectly portrayed the theme of ageing. Askeladd and Bjorn both charge at each other. Askeladd pierces Bjorn chest and collapses in front of him. Bjorn tells him that all he ever wanted was to be considered a friend Askeladd as his dying words as a warrior.&#039;&#039; Askeladd tells him that he was his only friend, and he dies. Keep in mind these people are brutal murderers, bad people who killed countless men, women and children during their lifetime together yet their stories were presented in such a way that they aren&#039;t just generic evil guys who are evil for the sake of being evil.<br />
<br />
Askeladd losing Bjorn is like losing your best friend. The person has been with you since childhood and you did many great things with them however your best friend body eventually gave up due to ageing. Right after the tragic duel a broken down Askeladd challenges Thorfinn to a duel and as usual, Askeladd beats in a duel but this time he didn&#039;t just win the duel. He beats the ever-living crap of him. After that, Askeladd says a couple of lines which are important to Thorfinn and Askeladd characters. <br />
(End of Spoilers)<br />
<br />
One of Vinland Saga&#039;s main messages is facing against time. Askeladd may still be a ruthless Viking but as time passes on his glory days as a Viking will be a thing of the past as his body is slowly deteriorating him.<br />
If you have a hobby that you are passionate about it, it&#039;s best to do it while young otherwise before you know it you become old and fragile. This also plays along with Throfinn character arc as he just ends up killing a deteriorating old man instead of a middle-aged man that Throfinn met 10 years ago as a kid.<br />
This is stuff I want to see in anime. A show that is not only entertaining to watch but it teaches you something and Vinland Saga&#039;s, case it taught me the dark side of revenge and ageing. <br />
<br />
A well-written plot is only as good as its characters and this is where Vinland Saga truly shines thanks to how multi-layered the cast is.<br />
<br />
Thorfinn is a great and well-written lead. From his innocent youth to his cold-blooded individual he still remains to be a compelling chararter from beginning to end.<br />
<br />
Some people may label Thorfinn as an edgy empty husk with no personality and I can see why but you have to remember that he was at one point at rock bottom. After losing father he had nowhere to go. His first course of action is to follow and kill the person that killed his father. He develops his survival instinct and dagger fighting skills needed to survive while Askeladd and his men are busy killing people. His transformation from an innocent kid to a cold-blooded warrior was satisfying to watch. <br />
<br />
As much as I adored Thorfinn, growth, Askeladd completely steals. He is easily the best character in the show. He&#039;s a ruthless Viking but also a twisted father figure for Thorfinn. He knows that Thorfinn has a grudge against him yet he doesn&#039;t really care about Thorfinn main goal as he just wants to live his life as a Viking as best he can before time, reaches up to him. I really like his backstory his revenge on his father. I liked his chaddy personality and generally a badass on the battlefield.<br />
<br />
Seeing Thorfinn and Askeladd relationship playoff is like watching a master taming an aggressive stray dog. You know the dog will deliver the killing blow to you at any moment but you sent the dog to various dogfight competitions in the underworld just to keep it busy. <br />
This relationship happened until the second half as they respect and care for each other.<br />
He&#039;s the true hero of Vinland Saga as well-being the heart of it because it wasn&#039;t for him then the show wouldn&#039;t have been as astonishing as it is.<br />
<br />
One of the things I appreciate about Vinland Saga was how it was able to make its villains as grounded as possible and Thorkell is the best example of this outside of Askeladd. When you first see Thorkell you think to yourself &#039;&#039;another muscular one-dimensional guy that Throhin has to kill just have a duel with Askeladd just for revenge&#039;&#039;, however, the show manages to flip people&#039;s expectations. Outside his threatening appearance, he&#039;s one of the most compelling characters in the show. Despite him being the villain for the majority of the series he has a strong sense of honour towards his opponents in battle. He absolutely hates being interrupted in battle as he thinks that stopping a fight is worst than retreating. This is shown when his facing off Throfinn for the second time. On of all that he has a great backstory that relates to Thor.<br />
<br />
The supporting chararter are just as strong as at the main characters and they are all engaging and interesting in their own ways.<br />
<br />
The visuals are nothing short of fantastic. You can tell the amount of dedication and effort these people have over Wit Studio put into this anime. Am still surprised that this show was able to look incredible, especially just coming off Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2.<br />
Some of the scenery in the show looks incredible and they could legitimately pass off as a wallpaper for your computer. The character designs perfectly capture Makoto Yukimura art-style from the manga. The animation is smooth consistent and very well-animated it may not be as stylish as Fire Force or Demon Slayer but it has the substance to back it up.<br />
<br />
If I had any issues with the visuals it would be awkward to use of CGI at times. To Vinland Saga&#039;s credit, the CGI is mostly competent as it blends in with the 2D backgrounds. However, in some incenses especially towards the middle portion, the CGI becomes janky. Lucky didn&#039;t break my immersion as I was so invested with the plot and characters that I didn&#039;t notice it but at the same time, I do acknowledge that is a problem for some.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack for Vinland Saga was done by Yutaka Yamada the same person that composed the soundtrack for Tokyo Ghoul and sadly his score on Vinland Saga frankly bad.<br />
This is a terrible soundtrack that does a disjustice to the show&#039;s setting. Sure it had some okay piano tracks now and then but for the most part, the soundtrack screams dull and aimless with its stock of uninspired historical tracks that put a small dent to an otherwise great show.<br />
<br />
When I think of good historical soundtracks I think of Black Butler, The Heroic Legend of Arslan, Golden Kamuy, Rose of Versailles, not this half-fast mess that is called Vinland Saga soundtrack.<br />
<br />
The first opening theme MUKANJYO by Survive Said The Prophet is a beautifully composed song that does a masterful job capturing the dark and ambitious tone of the year. I also really like the screaming vocals towards the end of song. It just screams revenge and power.<br />
Too bad the second Dark Crow by MAN WITH A MISSION is nowhere near as good as MUKANJYO. It&#039;s not a bad song by any means but it didn&#039;t fit with the Viking setting at all. I even go as far as Golden Kamuy&#039;s OP Winding Road by MAN WITH A MISSION would have been a better choice for 2nd OP than Dark Crow. It&#039;s a decent song on its own right but it&#039;s a lacklustre follow up to MUKANJYO.<br />
Despite the lacklustre 2nd opening theme, I found both the ending themes to be great. Not as amazing as the first opening theme but I take them over the second opening any day.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is strong and very well-acted. Each of the Seiyuus fit the role characters perfectly.<br />
There is currently no English Dub but I hope it gets one in the near future by Viz Media or BangZoom<br />
<br />
Even with its issues, I had a blast with Vinland Saga. It is a show that is filled with passion and love thanks to its well-written story that makes you think, great production visuals that do the manga justice and multi-layered characters that draws you in.<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a grounded historical Seinen series that has intriguing thematic exploration, high stakes and kickass relatable characters then Vinland Saga is the anime for you.<br />
<br />
Outstanding effort Wit Studio.

    [Spoiler Warning]<br />
<br />
What do you get when you combine one of the most fascinating old-world cultures with a medium known for turning out some of the most visceral action and drama series in the entertainment industry? You get a fairly cliche’ and familiar prologue that is mostly a victim of 15 years worth of hype and fervor. As someone who has not read the manga, I know absolutely nothing about Vinland Saga and the things that make it great. Sue me. But, I feel like even if you’re a huge fan of this series, you gotta admit that this introduction is at least kinda shit, right?<br />
<br />
What

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315163">
        makes it kinda shit you ask? Two things.<br />
1) Thorfinn.<br />
2) Thorfinn’s dad.<br />
<br />
Let’s start with Thorfinn, a bratty little kid who I find really hard to relate to and even harder to like. Thorfinn’s main problem is that he’s annoying. He’s whiny, mouths off constantly, and has a huge ego that more often then not gets him into bad situations. One particular instance of this is when he forces himself onto a boat that he REALLY shouldn’t have. Then, after some “plot” happens and people die because of him, instead of developing into a more clearheaded character who learns that being an ass is not the way, he turns into a vengeance-fueled edgelord muttering really cool lines of dialogue like “I’ll kill you...” and “Damn you...” under his breath. An improvement for sure, but not one that makes me wanna sit down and watch a whole season of this show.<br />
<br />
In summary: <br />
Whiny → Emotionless edgelord protagonist in a done-to-death story about revenge.<br />
<br />
The problem with Thorfinn’s dad is the problem I have with most anime that come with the “historical” tag. I am constantly fooled into thinking that “historical” means “realistic”, but it doesn’t. Vinland Saga is one of those shows where I think death is a real threat for these characters and that to stave it off, they have to use their brains more so than their brawn. And then Thorfinn’s dad comes along and defeats(note: doesn’t kill) a small army of trained, armed warriors with just his fists. <br />
	<br />
What!!? How!!? Why!!? Thorfinn’s dad was already incredibly boring when we found out that he’s more stoic than a dilapidated cabin in the woods, but now we find out that he’s an isekai protagonist and a paragon of morals that won’t kill even though it makes no sense for him not to. Granted, this problem has been rectified, but I’m still afraid that instead of watching a bunch of vikings employing tactics, we’re just gonna end up watching another 20 episodes of Thorfinn becoming an anime angel of death. <br />
	<br />
In summary: <br />
Not realistic, but really feels like it should at least try to be.<br />
<br />
Everything else about this anime is fine. The art looks nice whenever you’re not drowning in a sea of CGI vikings. There’s a few rough running animations and fight scenes sometimes don’t flow as smoothly as they should, but it’s not the end of the world. The music is fine, except for the last 10 seconds of the opening theme, which should be a war crime. The characters are pretty forgettable, but Askeladd is looking like he’s the diamond in the dung pile, and his unique relationship with Thorfinn looks like it could be one of the more interesting things to come in this season.<br />
	<br />
I was really excited to finally see what all of the hubbub with this series was, but I must admit that I am a bit disappointed so far. It’s clearly not a bad series, but it’s just not clicking with me like it should. But, maybe that’s what I get for watching cute shows about little girls having fun going on camping trips and crap like that. My body just wasn’t ready for all of this blond haired, blue eyed testosterone. Honestly, I was completely ready to write-off this show as just another relic that manga readers always swear is really deep and stuff, but this last episode gives me some hope. <br />
<br />
As long as Thorfinn’s relationship with Askeladd is nuanced and properly executed, they could easy become strong enough characters to carry this show. Likewise, if we get more scenes like the one between Thorfinn and the old lady that shelters him, it could do wonders for his character. This scene did a really nice job of showing that the boy still has some humanity left in him and it’s nice to see that contrast with the dehumanization that is happening to him from all of the fighting and killing. I just hope he talks about his thoughts and feelings more in the future, instead of blankly looking into the screen, pretending to be just as bored and unenthused as I am.<br />
<br />
Final Verdict: <br />
Zombieland is still the superior Saga. 20 bucks says Saki could easily beat the stuffing out of Thorfinn up and down anime England.<br />
<br />
Score:<br />
Story - 6<br />
Art - 5<br />
Sound - 5<br />
Character - 6<br />
Enjoyment -5

    This is what the berserk 2016 anime should have looked like <br />
<br />
Story <br />
The story is about revenge and the growth of are main character as his views change from a boy to a pure blooded viking. While the show is slow paced the characters and action will hold your interest. <br />
<br />
Art<br />
The art in the show is really well done since it&#039;s made by Wit Studio the same people who do Shingeki no Kyojin and many other damn good looking anime. Unfortunately the only part in the anime that looks bad at times is the sea and for a viking show that&#039;s kinda bad but since

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315110">
        the rest of the show looks so good i&#039;m willing to overlook the bad cgi water.<br />
<br />
Music<br />
Hmm music is 50/50 for me while it sounds good like the op is one of my fav this season but the rest of the music doesn&#039;t really fit a viking show now it is good just for me doesn&#039;t really fit the setting. <br />
<br />
Character <br />
<br />
So far I&#039;ve really liked the characters they look and act like vikings and i&#039;m enjoying are main character growth but as of only ep 6 I can&#039;t put to much into this. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment <br />
I love this show so far and i&#039;ve only heard good things from the manga readers so i&#039;m really looking to see more from the story. <br />
<br />
Overall <br />
I&#039;m going to give this a 9 for now since it&#039;s only on ep 6 but if it continues to be as good as it is now it will shot up to a 10 without a doubt it&#039;s the anime of the season  <br />
<br />

    Story: 10 It’s a realistic Viking epic about the life journey of Thorfinn, the manga already had a fantastic layout for the story and the anime makes sure to follow through, making sure not to skip any content, even adding scenes like kid Thorfinn training which was extremely enjoyable to watch. Also it seems to be taking its time with the pacing which is nice as now these early moments actually feel like arcs, if Thorfinn’s childhood was rushed, then no doubt would it have had less of an impact. Also just seeing how they make sure to push the true horror of Vikings will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315096">
        make Thorfinn’s story arc very enjoyable. Also just remember Thorfinn is an idiot kid who doesn’t really have much education.<br />
Art: 10 The art and animation in this show will blow you away, even though realistic all the colors flourish with the interesting lighting. Wit Studios, makers of AOT and Mahoutsukai no Yome have done a fantastic job with the 2d animation. What few CG moments there are in the show are done wonderfully by Twin Engine who also did the CG for Dororo. Yabuta, Shuuhei, the director is showing his experience with the dynamic action scenes, full of interesting shots, as he directed the 3d parts of AOT and Parasyte. Also the wide focus action shots of all the fights are a goddamn spectacle, and with the sad scenes having all the right amount of dynamic motion to make them hit, its just a joy to watch.<br />
Sound: 10 The music and sound effects fit perfectly with the scenes and really help push the Viking vibe the anime is going for. Background music is also just great, the action scenes have blood pumping music while the somber scenes have a nice melancholic feel to them, looking at you pianist. The sound effects like the fire going on, the chest opening, or swords being drawn and swung, all of it really helps with the anime’s immersion which in turn should make the sad/action story beats more punctuated. Also, I find also the voice casting perfect, though not what I expected, Askeladd’s voice is the perfect mix of charismatic, scumbag while on the other end Thors is very deep yet gentle. <br />
Character: 9 All the characters are depicted exactly as they were in the manga, and as the story goes on you will see the author makes sure not to make any of the characters to flat/tropey. Since this is early on and with the 24 episodes some of the characters right now feel a little flat but as long as the anime continues following the manga, the characters should become a lot more interesting to watch. <br />
Enjoyment: 10 I was honestly attached to my screen the entire time I was watching this anime, just noticing all the details and watching in awe at the art of the anime truly makes for an enjoyable watch.<br />
Overall: 10 Honestly, this is close to what we could hope for as a perfect adaptation of Vinland Saga, not too much CG and when the CG is used it’s used smartly and I have absolutely no complaints about the 2d animation so far. I can definitely say that this is a must watch anime if you have any interest in the period of Vikings as this is the well told story with many interesting twists and characters.<br />
