    Just gonna be honest and give this a 10/10!<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t actually finished the series but I did get to see the movie in theaters. It was simply amazing! I won&#039;t give anything away but you get the typical Gintama goodness!<br />
<br />
The story is pretty great. Gintama&#039;s jokes are amazing and the way the story was set up was pretty original! The beginning threw me off but, Gintama always does that, to be honest.<br />
<br />
The characters were SIMPLY FANTASTIC! The facial expressions and reactions were awesome and I, along with the theater, were laughing to death because of it. Seriously, great design, expressions, outfits, etc.<br />
<br />
The audio was GENIUS!

          <span style="display: none;" id="review105105">
        Spyair was awesome as always and the music was incredible. Some familiar music was played and the movie&#039;s original and the battle, humor, etc sounds were great.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment is 18798370984273984 out of 10. You can&#039;t beat this. I watched the One Piece and Dragon Ball Z movies and Gintama greatly kicked them in enjoyment. I haven&#039;t laughed so hard in forever. <br />
<br />
Even if you haven&#039;t watched Gintama, watch the movie because then you&#039;ll REALLY wanna watch the anime. Got a few of my friends into Gintama now and they&#039;ve never seen it before but changed their minds thanks to the movie.

    With this movie, Gintama has reached even greater heights. Compared to the previous movie, Gintama: The Final Chapter - Be Forever Yorozuya isn&#039;t a retelling of an arc, but a story of Gin&#039;s past. Many fans throughout the Gintama franchise have always wanted an arc focusing about Gin&#039;s past during the Joui War, and now we get it. As a Gintama fan, you will definitely want to watch this movie about his past and how he tries to cope about what is to come of him. <br />
<br />
The movie begins a bit slow at start and this is due to the &quot;Movie Thief&quot; character. While Odd

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125927">
        Jobs are working in a theater for some money, the Movie Thief himself starts doing the obvious; filming illegally. As the long discussion goes with Gin and the Movie Thief about right and wrong, the producers decide to add in some jokes for the viewers to enjoy, by putting tons of laughs into it for the viewers. Is that all this Movie Thief is though? Is he just there to film illegally? Or maybe his role is more significant than we may think. But I thought this movie was about his past, not them working at a theater... Guess you&#039;ll just have to watch!<br />
<br />
One would think that the way the producers would portray this movie is by showing his past... Well of course they&#039;re going to show his past, but the producers decide to use a theme we&#039;re all used to seeing now, and that is &quot;Time-travel.&quot; To be honest, I was a bit surprised by seeing this, since I just recently watched the Steins;Gate movie and didn&#039;t think that Gintama would also use this type of theme. Though, as we all know, time-travel is a commonly seen thing in shows and that of movies. Some could say that the movie is pretty predictable, but that&#039;s for you to decide; I didn&#039;t think it was.<br />
<br />
The one thing I could say that I was disappointed by was the fact that there was little to no development on the future selves. All we know is that the characters have grown in these past 5 years and that Shinpachi looks nowhere close to his younger self. And Kagura, well... She&#039;s grown in places that count to say the least. All that&#039;s known is that Odd Jobs is no longer a group of people, but split into two groups. Odd Jobs Fumiya and the other Odd Jobs Takamoku. Wait, what happened to Gin, the leader? Well... to be frank, he&#039;s missing. <br />
<br />
Gintama has always been great for their soundtrack, and they even used some from the series. You can especially expect some great OST during the shounen type scenes later on in the movie. Though, that&#039;s all I can really say about the OST because there&#039;s nothing to really complain about and nothing to say vastly amazing about, but it still does the job at providing some great sounds for us, the viewers<br />
<br />
The art has been vastly improved as expected for a movie. I wish it could be like this in the T.V series as well because the fights are animated better, clearer and more colorful to watch when seen in better quality. Character designs as I&#039;ve talked a little about have been changed for a few as well. Shinsengumi is no longer the police force anymore really, but almost something like the Joui rebels themselves, though not necessarily identical. The producers decided to poke at some of the characters too, by making fun of them; Catherine mainly, who prioritizes in mainly making the viewer&#039;s think of her as the troll character of Gintama. Elizabeth&#039;s appearance changed drastically... One could say he&#039;s all muscle now.<br />
<br />
The movie, Gintama: The Final Chapter - Be Forever Yorozuya is definitely something a fan of the T.V series should watch. As for myself, I&#039;m always excited for more Gintama and still await the T.V series to return for me to enjoy some good laughs, action packed scenes and just overall enjoyment that is Gintama. Everyone who has watched the T.V series knows that all we&#039;ve seen about Gin&#039;s past was little flashbacks during the war. So shouldn&#039;t we be seeing more of the war? Well no, if they did that the film would be shorter than a 3 episode long series. This was the best way to do things IMO, and the producers did it pretty damn good. Overall, the film gives tons of laughs throughout it, but kind of lacked in the action packed scenes. Though one could argue that Gintama isn&#039;t your typical shounen and that action isn&#039;t everything, which is correct because Gintama does what it does best and that is making you laugh.

    The new Gintama movie is a side story that delivers some laughs and new character designs, but is totally convoluted. Asking Gintama to make sense is kind of a faux-pas. It&#039;s demented on purpose. But what starts off as an absurdist comedy quickly devolves into boring shounen fan pandering. The movie follows 265 episodes, a recap film, plus a series of practically unrelated OVAs. In conclusion it is a minor entry in the series overall, but is certainly not worth missing for any Gintama fan.<br />
<br />
The story opens up with the Yorozuya three and Sadaharu in a movie theatre working part-time to grab some cash. Through

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125777">
        a series of surprisingly refreshing and funny fourth-wall jokes, Gin and a new and hilarious character, the Movie Thief, end up travelling forward in time by five years. Here Gin learns the true identity of the Movie Thief and discovers that the world has been drastically altered and many people on Earth have died. To make matters worse, Yorozuya has disbanded and in this world Gin is missing and the Gin from five years ago must try and restore the world.<br />
<br />
The story, which renews the most popular theme in contemporary anime, is about time traveling. If you&#039;ve seen one anime about time traveling, whether it be Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya or Steins;Gate, you&#039;ve seen them all. What these stories have in common is using time-travel as a plot-device to provoke a sense of regret and gratefulness out of our otherwise complacent main characters. This concept strings pretty far back in the medium and unless the story is presented in an innovative manner the plot device of time travel is incredibly predictable. Time travel can no longer exist as the sole concept in a work. In Steins;Gate it was a character study on the stress of an individual undergoing intense trauma, and in Disappearance it was the deliberation between being safe or being  in love. In both stories the main characters support the work. Here time travel is sadly used as a way to advance a very generic story in a setting that was created to provide the Gintama fanbase with some fun character designs.<br />
<br />
While the story is predictable it still is entertaining to any shounen fan. All our favorite Gintama characters appear, and the jokes ultimately keep flowing. But we don&#039;t get to see the characters from the main series develop into their new character designs, we just see how they&#039;ve changed in five years. It&#039;s a bit disappointing coming from a series that often pays meticulous care to even the most trivial character&#039;s background. For a movie marketed as game-changing for the franchise, I can&#039;t help but to feel a little swindled. It&#039;s mostly just the same Gintama jokes from the show with less attention to story.<br />
<br />
The ill-explained time travel really hurts the bombastic finale of the film and everything about the story felt simply too convenient. While the movie is presented as a mystery Gin does almost none of the footwork to figure out about the world around him or how to fix it. The events of the movie occur jarringly fast. Plot points simply keep forcing themselves into scenes until finally you arrive at the final battle. It&#039;s frustrating that the film is so linear and there is almost no despair to be felt in a world that was supposedly ravaged. Even as far as a Gintama arc would go, it is safe to say that this would be a very weak one. The story suffers from cliches, linearity, and unbelievable explanations to the point of boredom. The main Gintama series can do better than this story and it&#039;s upsetting to see such little thought put into it.<br />
<br />
The cast remains the same if not caricatured. Ultimately we learn nothing new about the cast of the entire series other than that Kagura five years in the future is stacked. There is no character development in this film, which you can expect from a side story, but there is also no new character relationships. The films characters are very static.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack lifts nearly all songs from the main anime series and is of course very fitting because of this. Despite the contempt for innovation here the score still feels right. The animation looks vastly improved from the main series, though! Simply put, it is more fluid and provides a greater range of facial expression. The fight scenes are also animated very well, and provide for some exciting hack-and-slash entertainment. The character designs are great and should be lauded as well. The movie does a great job poking fun at some characters with the astute redesigns and pays attention to detail here with wardrobe subtleties. A fun example is Shinpachi is wearing Gin&#039;s shirt and Kagura is wearing his robe as a skirt. If there&#039;s an reason to see this movie it&#039;s to see the older counterparts of each character.<br />
<br />
Gintama Yorozuya yo Eien Nare is typical Gintama. It&#039;s more Gintama. If you want more Gintama then watch this film. It&#039;s nothing innovative, and it&#039;s nothing you haven&#039;t seen before. Some of the jokes are really funny, but mostly the films struggles with a convincing plot and frequently devolves into artificial sentimentality. I liked the film but was disappointed in it&#039;s simplistic design, but I humbly hope Gintama returns to form with some more hotpot and Christmas episodes in April.

    I laughed, I cried, I felt. I cursed myself for not viewing it sooner. Be Forever Yorozuya encapsulates everything that makes Gintama in a two hour, finely wrapped package. If the tv series weren’t returning as of next year, I could think of no better way to send off the series.   <br />
<br />
Perhaps it needs no explanation, but although Gintama is, at its heart, an episodic comedy series, this film is best watched after at least watching the first series. As it is an anime where characters are its strongest point, more than basic knowledge is required for full enjoyment of the movie. <br />
<br />
  The story of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175189">
        the film, like some of the most memorable arcs in the series, starts out with a definite comedy vibe before vaulting into more serious territory. If you’re looking for a legitimate glimpse into the Joui war, then you won’t find it here. There are a few nods to the past here and there, but the main focus is more on Edo after five years without Gintoki. The most pleasantly surprising moment of the film is undoubtedly the seemingly plot-irrelevant, gag-ridden first twenty minutes that manages to tie into the main plot. The only real fault in the story is the antagonist, although in the context of the events (and the fact that it is basically equal parts comedy and action), the shortcomings in motive and backstory can be forgiven. Besides a final battle that can only be described as insanely epic fanservice, what really sold the film for me was the comedy. The humour is as basically everything you’d expect from Gintama: it ranges from toilet humour to parody (although here it generally falls somewhere in the middle of the range). The film manages to segue between comedy and seriousness effortlessly; at one point I was crying because of drama, and the next minute I was crying with laughter. Even if you don’t enjoy the serious arcs of Gintama, there’s plenty to enjoy from a comedy standpoint. A poignant ending, that can only be described as classic Gintama, features some great retconning of the past and caps off the film perfectly. <br />
<br />
  The most important aspect of Gintama is, of course, the characters, and even with the five year timeskip they don’t disappoint. If you’ve ever wanted to see Hasegawa have an important role in Gintama, then this is the film for you. There’s no real need to go into detail about the characters. After all, if you’ve already committed to the series, you should know what to expect. The changes that the characters have undergone after five years are such that they maintain their most notable quirks while each bringing something new to the table. They’re still the same perverts, sadists and everything else that you&#039;ve come to love (or maybe become annoyed at, I don’t know), but with a new coat of paint and a slight tune-up.<br />
<br />
  I had no complaints with the art of animation. I’m not down with all the technical terms and aspects, but both the art and animation are noticeably stepped up from the tv series. The animation flows well and the fights (few that there are) look fantastic. The new character designs all look incredibly solid. The only noticeable flaw was some slightly off-looking facial expressions, though these were few and didn’t detract from the film as a whole. If you think that’s being too forgiving, I could do worse and say something like “Oh, but it’s all good because Gintama’s always had that low budget charm about it”, but… nah. Seriously, if you’ve never had a problem with Gintama’s art style and animation fluidity then there’s no reason to start hating it here.<br />
<br />
  Not much to say from an audio standpoint. The music used in the film is essentially all from the series, meaning that it enhances the atmosphere, whether it be serious or comedic. It works just as well as it does in the series. The ending theme, Genjou Destruction by SPYAIR, is easily one of the better songs in the series.  <br />
<br />
When it gets right down to it, if you love Gintama or even just think it’s average, you owe it to yourself to see Be Forever Yorozuya. It will either reaffirm why you gave it so much praise in the first place, or if you fall into the latter category, might just persuade you that it’s worth viewing with fresh eyes. It’s a film that seamlessly marries the best comedy and action that the series has to offer, and I really don’t think it could’ve been pulled off any better.

    Ok I will have to be honest, I am a new comer to the Gintama series and I heard it was fantastic and I was excited to watch it. I do not know all of the characters personally well but I invited my friends to watch it with me who were also new and OH BOY OK NOW TO GET TO THE REVIEW. ( I would like to point my knowledge of the series first)<br />
<br />
STORY - 8<br />
Well firstly the synopsis is on top and I would not like to repeat it here. I would sum it up here quickly. Gintoki has disappeared in the other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review121551">
        world, not the one where our current characters are and Gintoki is transported there by a really funny introduction. (no more spoilers) I personally found it hilarious and I found myself laughing ALOT.<br />
<br />
Characters - 9<br />
The characters are grown up in the parallel universe where Gintoki has vanished and Kagura and Shinpachi does not get along there. The characters all had their own personalities which I really enjoyed and they were all really humorous.<br />
<br />
Animation - 10<br />
The animation is solid from the facial expressions which were SO PFFT QvQ and to the fighting scenes which I found to be very fluid and gets the job done. I&#039;m not a professional in what is good and what is bad animation but I found it really good. I really liked the way they drew the various facial expressions which really what made it funny.<br />
<br />
Sound - 9<br />
The music fits and nothing felt out of placed. They had some of their old songs in the anime/movie used in the ending credits and if you are a Gintama fan, it would be really nostalgic.<br />
<br />
Voice Acting<br />
The voice acting was splendid and during the humorous moments, they really shine and it was really like what you get in the anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 9.999999<br />
I personally enjoyed myself and I found myself laughing along with the crowd on how FUNNY IT WAS!<br />
<br />
The movie can be a little bit difficult to follow especially on who is who for new comers. For new comers who are going to watch the movie first might want to have a look on all the cast looks before they get in the movie since the movie had the cast to look different. This does not take away from the experience but it is neither that hard to follow for new comers but they can get confused on who is who and get the humor on how different were the casts before.<br />
<br />
Overall - 9<br />
This is a great movie and it has the same atmosphere as the anime series in terms of the jokes and humour. The reason why I gave it a 9 was because of the lack of tiny introduction of the characters but I do not think that was necessary as this is suppose to be a Gintama movie. However if I knew I would give it a 10. Don&#039;t let the ratings here turn you away these are just my personal honest opinions.

    I found this movie extremely enjoyable, from the start all the way until the end, it was hilarious! <br />
<br />
The beginning of the movie did start off slow, but the gradual progression was good, the story was building up at a good pace. <br />
<br />
The ending!! i must say, out of all the movies I&#039;ve watched so far, this has to be the best ending! It exceeded my expectations, even though a lot of events happened in the end, it did not feel rushed, everything seemed to fit nicely into the story. <br />
<br />
The best part of this anime......definitely seeing a future Shinpachi, Kagura, Hijikata, okita and kondo!!

          <span style="display: none;" id="review162279">
        But it was the ending that had me excited the most (i replayed it countless of times), i couldn&#039;t stop smiling, and i had goose bumps all over! <br />
<br />
Also! the sound track and music choice! SpyAir!!! when SpyAir&#039;s song-現状ディストラクション started to play!!! Seriously!! i was speechless, and soo excited i could not stop shaking!! <br />
<br />
So overall, Gintama: Kanketsu-hen - Yorozuya yo Eien Nare, WAS.AWESOME!!!!!!!!<br />
i highly highly recommend this anime movie! :)

    Being a fan of Gintama, I really looked forward to this movie. I was not really let down, but maybe that was because I already knew what was coming.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
It&#039;s an enjoyable story with some interesting twists and turns.The jokes and parodies are up to standard but is overshadowed by the fact that this seemed more of action-filled and drama movie. It still got me in tears and laughing the next second though. However, compared to other serious arcs, this would fall a little flat. It missed something that almost every arc had; a deeper insight into one of the character&#039;s past, most of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review128607">
        time Gintoki, so I was a little disappointed. Heck, even a filler arc had them. The time travel and virus were merely plot devices and could have been handled better. <br />
<br />
Art and animation: 9<br />
One of the things that I really anticipated was how the new, future characters would look like. All of their designs were done pretty well, almost everyone looked fantastic. I really liked the Japanese characters that appeared on the bodies during certain times (ahem, kinda spoiler). The post apocalyptic landscapes were stunning and detailed. Animation wise, there were scenes that looked really fluid and the fight scenes lived up to my expectations. I still haven&#039;t gotten over how Gintama looked like back in its earlier years so I don&#039;t take the HD for granted, especially how nice everything looks in a better quality. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
The seiyuus are still keeping up their good work. In fact, it was because of them that some parts are as moving as they are. Yu Kobayashi, Sarutobi&#039;s voice actor, really impressed me at one point. The music also hasn&#039;t changed much, sticking to its usual style.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
The characters are a huge reason why I love Gintama. They tried to do their best to fit in as much of the cast into this movie, but as cool as their design looks, their only given a few lines to say for nakama-ship. The movie focuses mainly on the trio, which is why it&#039;s called Yorozuya Forever. We get to know a little more about Gintoki&#039;s personality and beliefs, but sadly not much into his past. But for first timers, it would be hard to understand and like all the drama without watching the original series so it the character part may only appeal to those who have. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
I still love this movie very much and this was more entertaining compared to a retelling of an arc. Hopefully this won&#039;t be the last of Gintama or I would definitely have rated this waay lower. Not to mention that we didn&#039;t get the chance to see the Kiheitai or Kamui in this. Overall is 9/10 and I&#039;ll keep my fingers crossed for more upcoming Gintama.

    As if the anime wasn&#039;t incredibly good already...I really think this second film really tops both the series and the previous movie. It had all the elements of what makes the show so good including a wacky intro making it classic Gintama from the get-go.<br />
<br />
Story (9): I love the plot, very original in the sense of they managed to create a cohesive plot that connects all the characters that we know and tying into events from the series. Bringing the story into the future was really exciting because we get to see the characters we love in a whole new light which is always fun.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125773">
        Then there are the jokes; smartly placed amongst the drama and action. I only give it a 9 because it might get a little confusing towards the end though I assume most plots with time travel involved are tough to get your head around the first time &#039;round.<br />
<br />
Art (10): Not much to say besides I was in awe of how great the characters looked especially Kagura and the art for the action/battle scenes are breath taking. Had to watch some of those scenes twice since there was so much going on.<br />
<br />
Characters (10): I would give it an 11 if I could. Gintama&#039;s success essentially comes from it&#039;s character&#039;s. All individually unique and have their own quirks. If you are a fan of the show you know what I&#039;m talking about. I can&#039;t applaud the creators enough for writing the story in the future, it is a great way to expand on these characters and we can see how they look/act/change in 5 years.<br />
<br />
Sound (9): Since I&#039;m not sure how to judge sound I will base it off the voice acting and music. The music is great, another good song from SPYAIR, and compliments the action scenes. The voice-acting is top notch, breathing life into our fabulous characters. This is the reason why I love the anime more than the manga because the voices are so &quot;them&quot;! So props to Sugita, Kugimiya, Sakaguchi and the rest of the cast.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10): It&#039;s hard not to enjoy this movie. If anything you can count on the writing to brilliant: funny or dramatic. Start to finish it&#039;s fantastic - I didn&#039;t want the ride to end. I wanted to keep seeing these characters interact with each other and messing with one another. The bond between Yorozuya is so sincere you only want good things for the 3 of them. I won&#039;t spoil too much but the last half hour made my heart swell in a good way :) <br />
<br />
Overall (10): It&#039;s hilarious (like the scenes of how the characters see Gintoki in the future, seriously everyone else could hear me laughing on the upper floor), amazing visuals/action (when Shinpachi and Kagura first appear) and a whole lotta heart (the way they portray friendship and bonds is unique to me). Gintama in general has a special place in my heart for being the most original, funny and fearless anime I&#039;ve ever seen and the fact that it has such unsuspecting emotional depth puts it over the top. I think I veered away from talking about the movie but I can&#039;t help it. After watching this I  want more of the anime, I hope we will be trolled again and the series returns!

    Well to start off it should come by no surprise that i feel that this moive is awesome by my score.<br />
<br />
Well this moive is one of the kinds that you would expected form gintama. The moive was really funny but yet had an masterpiece story which was masterfully planed out and animated.<br />
<br />
Also the story doesnt give it all away and while sometimes it is obvious what going to happen next i only noticed a few mintues before thus keeping it enjoyble the whole way though.<br />
<br />
It put the music in the right places which only added to the epic feel it had already.<br />
<br />
All in all it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125825">
        was a great moive and if you havent watched gintama already you would still think this moive was great. <br />
<br />
I highly recommend this to anybody coming to be or is already a big fan of anime.

    *This review contains no spoiler*<br />
Instead of the usual wordy review, I am just going to give you a quick run down because, quite frankly, I don&#039;t have the time to write and you don&#039;t have the time to read. <br />
<br />
Story: 9.5<br />
A fulfilling story completed with the signature mixture of outlandish comedy and adrenaline-packed drama that we love about Gintama and all seamlessly packed into an almost 2 hours long movie. Some say the movie offers no new progress into the story, but that&#039;s a silly complain because, as with most anime films, this is meant to be, for the most part, non-canon or at least

          <span style="display: none;" id="review127477">
        not impacting the progress of the main series. I took out half a point because, as a fan of sci-fi, the way they portrayed time paradox was a little unsettling.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
All too often in the movie version of animes, due to a significantly larger budget, will have better visual as compared to the TV counterpart. Usually that is fantastic, but that could become a dual-edged sword when the improvement is so much that viewers get a sense of disconnect from the main series. This was not the case here. While the over all quality of the art was improved, it is able to maintain the look and feel of the TV series which makes this very comfortable for fans to get into.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
Again on the point of maintaining a sense of familiarity, much of the sound effects and BGM were preserved from the TV series. You may notice new sound tracks as we move towards the climax of the movie along with insert theme &quot;Genjō Distraction&quot; by SPYAIR which was brilliantly uplifting. Finally, near the end of the movie, they have included &quot;Pray&quot; by Tommy heavenly6 which fans will know it as the first TV opening theme, thus completing the theme of familiarity.<br />
Also, without saying too much, if you are someone like me who pays attention to voice acting, then you will be in for a treat.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
If you are looking for character development, again, you are watching the wrong thing. Here is what you WILL find, a grown Kagura, a Shinpachi who can actually fight, a fake Kenshin, a fake Shinsuke, an evolved Elizabeth and, most importantly, a reminder of why Gintama hosts some of the most beloved characters ever created in animation history. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
What&#039;s not to enjoy about this long awaited movie featuring all original materials? What I enjoy most about this movie is the fact that it doesn&#039;t feel rushed. You can tell that they really took their time to polish every part of this movie into perfection. It&#039;s no wonder that, despite its immerse popularity in Japan, this is the first original movie as compared to other shounen series like Naruto or Bleach. <br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
It is CRITICAL that you don&#039;t expect this to contain some insane revelation about Gintoki&#039;s past. Remember, that&#039;s what the main series (manga/TV) is for.<br />
That said, I would recommend this much more so for a fan than a non-fan as there are just too many things you would have to know about this series before you can fully enjoy all of its content. Unlike movies like the one for Gundam00, You will want to hug the first person you see after finishing this and not to punch the first stranger in the street. Also unlike other shounen anime movies as in Bleach of Naruto, this movie is not a &quot;for profit&quot; movie. What I mean is that this movie does not feel like it was made for the sole purpose of box office, but instead, a genuine response to all the fans who all had been waiting for an original film featuring the Yorozuya.

    &quot;THIS MOVIE IS BAD&quot;... if there&#039;s someone who said something like that i dont know their reaction about other anime movie then ( or maybe they were drunk when they said that )<br />
 <br />
since i&#039;m gintama fan this review might be a bit biased but because i already watched all the episode and chapter i need to shout this<br />
<br />
&quot;THIS MOVIE IS AND ALWAYS BE THE BEST MOVIE I&#039;VE EVER WATCHED&quot;<br />
Well maybe not the best to other people but i can safely say that gintama kanketsu-hen : yorozuya eien nare is one of the great anime movie<br />
<br />
well lets just begin to review corner then :<br />
<br />
story :

          <span style="display: none;" id="review126113">
        10/10<br />
first time i watched the movie  i was confused. i thought the movie thief was just a part of advertisement scene ( you know, the scene before the movie start ). then somehow he became one of the key character later on ( you need to watch it yourself ). while the story look&#039;s like was parodying some other anime, gintama add its own plot  and genre that made it realy original. in conclusion : this movie have great and unique storyline and definitely better than benizakura arc<br />
<br />
art : 9/10<br />
well at least i can say that the animation is better than the anime. the expression every characters had was priceless and simply amazing. and the animation when fighting scene appeared was the best. definitely great<br />
<br />
sound  : 9/10<br />
simply amazing. nothing more to say<br />
<br />
character : 10/10<br />
gintama has a lot of characters that have different unique personality in the first place so of course it will lead to great story. ohh and chin**-san you are the second greatest character after gintoki lol.<br />
<br />
enjoyment : ehhh  i cant add 100 to my  score  (tch damn the limited rating )<br />
the movie keep me interested from the very beginning ( yepp that amazingly weird opening ) until the very end. seriously i have watched many anime movies before and that&#039;s the first time i&#039;ve seen such great opening ( i will try to watch anime movie  that have even weirder opening than this ). the movie succed in making me rofl when its time to laugh and shed a tear when sad scene appeared. all in all gintama the movie is the best<br />
<br />
overall : 10/10<br />
i have nothing more to say. the movie has a little flaw ( if it had a flaw in the first place ). the battle is great, the character is great, the story is great, etc<br />
well maybe for some new audience who never watched gintama before couldn&#039;t understand some of the joke but dont worry it&#039;s still great even without the joke ( and there&#039;s also universal joke any way )<br />
<br />
p/s : i never knew we can eat 3d<br />
<br />
sorry for the bad grammar<br />
<br />
 <br />

    Advice: don&#039;t skip the beginning even though it seems like an ad<br />
<br />
I thought the movie was really touching and I enjoyed it immensely. The beginning confused me, I thought it was simply one of those warnings not to pirate movies that typically come at the beginning of the movie, but instead it was part of the plot! I love how Gintama has the ability to throw the viewer off. However, it is probably not something enjoyed by everyone. Some people like things to be straightforward.<br />
<br />
This movie embodies what I love about Gintama. Mixed in with all the comedy is a very touching and exciting story!

    I was a little worried at first because I hadn&#039;t watched gintama in a while and I thought that I was holding expectations that were too high, but of course, the movie reminded me that gintama will never disappoint. <br />
<br />
Not much I really need to say about the movie. It had every aspect of gintama pretty well covered and had a pretty solid story to it. Since it dove into the idea time travel, it was bound to have some questionable plot points, but come on. It&#039;s  gintama so anything is possible. Amazing movie and hope to see the anime returning in the future.

    Gintama: Kanketsu-hen - Yorozuya yo Eien Nare, or Gintama: The Final Chapter - Be Forever Yorozuya, is the second film in the Gintama franchise, written by the author of Gintama,  Hideaki Sorachi. Written as a possible end to the anime, this film brings Gintama into darker and more dramatic territory, more so then ever before, whilst still balancing the film with the humour that made the series so popular. All this, and more, is all blended together to create one of the best anime films created in modern days.<br />
<br />
The film opens with the Yorozuya crew workng in a theater,and whilst it looks like a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review126267">
        pre-film short, it&#039;s actually the opening to the film itself,and leads into the main plot. We find Gintoki Sakata in a world, five years in the future, where the world is falling apart, and he quickly find his friends and associates are all very different in this post apocalyptic world. Once the the main part of the film is reached, the story does not feel rushed, and does not drag out. In my opinion, the film is paced perfectly.<br />
<br />
One of the things that worried me was that this may indeed be the end of Gintama. Whilst now it feels likely that the anime series will continue, the way the plot of this movie is brought to a close really does bring a sense of finality to the series, and when it comes down to it, I would be perfectly happy if the series ended with this movie, as it accomplishs the rare feat of bring a popular series to a (possible) close.<br />
<br />
Though, lets forget the plot for a few moments, and talk about the characters, one of the most praised aspects of the Gintama series. As stated above, this is a world five years in the future, and all of Gin&#039;s friends are very, very different. We see Shinpachi and Kagura all grown up, no longer the children they were. Every character has been affected by the events of this film, and all of them now have different ideals, not to mention new character designs. Gin, Shinpachi, and Kagura&#039;s characters are all very, very fleshed out.<br />
<br />
When it really comes down to it, this is the one part of the film that slightly suffers - whilst the redesigns of the characters are all well and good, we don&#039;t get enough time to learn more about -why- these characters are so different. Outside of Shinpachi and Kagura, we learn very little about why characters such as Katsura, Hijikata, and Sougo are so different. Within the medium of the film, however, this is acceptable, as they couldn&#039;t keep the rest of the film at such a high level whilst devoting an equal amount of time to both characters and plot.<br />
<br />
Of course, with this being a high budget film, the art and sound of the film are breathtaking, with new music recorded for the film, and the fight scenes never looking so amazing. To my delight, some music from the earlier seasons of Gintama is also used near the end of the film, again bringing a sense of finality to the film. SPYAIR, who&#039;s song, &quot;Sakura Mitsu Tsuki&quot;, was used as the second opening of Gintama&#039; : Enchousen, return to the franchise, composing the song, &quot;Genjo Destruction&quot;, as the main theme of the music. Finally, as the second of two ending songs, &quot;Pray&quot;, by Tommy heavenly6, we get a sense of nostalgia for those who watched Gintama from he very beginning.<br />
<br />
In closing, Gintama: The Final Chapter, manages to accomplish the rare feat of an (possible) ending film that manages to deliver on all aspects. Whilst it&#039;s a shame some of the supporting characters could not fleshed out enough, it&#039;s understandable due to the limited time of the medium. All in all, Gintama: The Final Chapter: Yorozuya Forever is a truly stellar anime film, that should be a benchmark for all anime franchise films to aspire to.

    I remember all the laughs I had watching Gintama. I was so excited for this movie and it had been lost in my memories until now after waiting for English subtitles. I was right to be excited for this movie because it was... absolutely amazing. Many things in the movie might seem plain like the plot but the creators of the movie have dug deeper and expressed them more thoroughly which can get to the reader even more than a regular scene. The classic jokes of Gintama never fail and the transitions between serious and humor are great too. If you don&#039;t watch Gintama, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125949">
        suggest you do and even if you don&#039;t want to watch Gintama, I suggest you watch Gintama: Kanketsu-hen - Yorozuya yo Eien Nare because it is absolutely amazing!

    This movie is awesome, It has a great story and everything.<br />
<br />
I love Gintama and this movie makes me love it anymore.<br />
It seems like a serious mainstream movie when you look at the storyline, but its a totally different thing in the movie. <br />
<br />
<br />
It tells an amazing story, and it strives to give us the humour that we see in the manga and anime in which we love. I love the transformation of characters and it is currently one of my favorite movies of all time.

    This is my first review, so bear with me =]<br />
<br />
Gintama the movie 2, something I&#039;ve been personally waiting for, for such a long time and boy was it even worth it? ATTARIMAIDA KONOYARO<br />
<br />
Story 11/10  the plot for this movie is genius, from the the cause of the future downfall to the way it was dealt with, and I&#039;ve not exaggerating at all, and ofcourse the freaking the surprise factors that were there left my jaw down for sometime, i could really write way more but trying to keep it spoiler-free <br />
<br />
Art 9.5/10  the art of gintama has always been beautiful and detailed ,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125883">
        how about having it in movie form??? from the expressions that were captured and done beautifully to the fast pacing moments where the animation looked stunning to the magnificent colors and awesome scenery, man did u even see how breath-taking was the cloudy sky?? it looked like water painting<br />
<br />
Sound 9.5/10 the right tracks kicked off at the right time every time whether it was the sad scenes to the comedy scenes to the battle scenes where my adrenaline kept rising and got me excited so much alot of times.<br />
<br />
characters 9.5/10 the character designs really exceeded my expectations (did u see okita sogo-kun and kyubei-chan) even the white haired girl who we learn later is [SPOILER} was outstanding, PS: i began to respect Sachan and Tama way more after  watching the movie and you will know why once you&#039;ve seen it<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10 I laughed like i never did, Almost cried and had an enormous adrenaline rush, every scene is memorable,Hell, the first 10 minutes made me almost wet my pants of laughter(god i love Zura&#039;s theme), even parodying stuff was there (Classic Gintama) and a certain scene made me shed a tear of how sad it was ( Sachan&#039;s Seiyuu Deserve a freaking Medal for her performance in that certain scene ) and of course the action was nothing short of brilliant, i laughed so hard even at the last 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Overall 11/10 a perfect movie for one of the best Anime series of all time. you cant go wrong with such movie which perfected every part of its genre (and it has a lot) seriously if we dont get a continuation of the series soon I&#039;m gonna be kicking so stuff

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
Uhm...this movie was kind of weird.<br />
Not that I&#039;m dissapointed in it or anything, just kind of confused.<br />
The first half started out great. It was funny and didn&#039;t take itself seriously, like any other Gintama episode. The second half becomes a serious action romp with little to no humor included at all. <br />
<br />
Some of these serious parts of the movie was really good, I thought. An example being any scenes in which Otae is sick; especially that scene that lasted one second of her introduction with Kondou&#039;s reaction toward her less-than-healthy state.<br />
<br />
That second half as I stated was the point where it started

          <span style="display: none;" id="review225042">
        getting weird. First thing that confused me was why future Gintoki dressed up as the Enmi figure to begin with. Why? Why did Gin fight each other? What was the point? Just go and tell him &quot;Yo, u gotta go bak in2 da past and kill Me n shit&quot;, but no, he waited until present Gin stabbed him in the goddamn chest. <br />
<br />
Tama sends present Gin into the past soonafter, and tells him that this is the last time she can send people back to the past. Gin then meets up with Madao and everyone else who somehow knows about Gin even though in the past, we already established that everyone had forgotten about Gin at this point, here, we clearly see they all know who Gintoki is. <br />
<br />
This doesn&#039;t make sense, since even if Tama DID tell them about the existence of Gintoki, there is a SERVERELY low chance that every single one of them would believe this green haired robot lady of whom they had never met before. And even if they DID believe her about the Gin thing, the scene in the current present day shows her in a completely busted up state, which means that we can consider that this Tama is the same one that sent Gintoki back to the past. That means she shouldn&#039;t even have any time jump charges left, since the last one she used was already used on sending Gin back. <br />
<br />
The Gin and Otae reunion scene was a pretty weird scene too. For one, this pretty much destroys any emotional stakes we had toward her character is pretty much destroyed. Well, obviously this scene is supposed to be a &quot;Fuck Yeah!&quot; moment that is supposed to make us feel good to see Otae in tip top condition. The problem arises from how there was too small a time span between us seeing her in a sickened state and us seeing her fighting like a badass. If this kanketsu hen was episodic, then yeah, maybe this would have worked since time spans between episodes feel much longer than it would in one long running movie, so it doesn&#039;t really work here. Another issue with this scene is that if she came from the timeline in which Gintoki was forgotten, even if within that timeline she accepts Tama&#039;s words, there is no way she would remember being sick and bed-ridden, because this is a completely different timeline now. So that exchange of &quot;I thought you where sick in bed&quot; does make any sense whatsoever.<br />
<br />
The very ending of this big fight sequence doesn&#039;t make much sense either. Past Gin , Katsura, Takasugi and Sakamoto, who assumedly know nothing about altered future Gin and Co. help them without questioning anything. <br />
<br />
Look, I get that this movie only really exists to be one last (but not really) hurrah for the Gintama anime and get all the significant characters to get together and do something epic, even if doesn&#039;t really make sense, because the purpose of the movie isn&#039;t to deliver a tightly written classic for years to come; it&#039;s a last spurt of throwing onto the screen whatever it can to make the viewer reminisce of every single Gintama episode that had aired thus far. Is that an excuse for a movie that doesn&#039;t make sense? No, not really. For me, anyway. It obviously doesn&#039;t for most people as we can see from the extraordinarily high MAL score here.<br />
<br />
If time travel bullshit that makes no sense doesn&#039;t bother you, then this movie&#039;s fully recommended for any Gintama fan. If you&#039;re like me, then...you might want to stay away from this one. Especially since there&#039;s an anime continuation anyway, so just go and watch the new anime.

    Only the Greatest Anime I have ever seen, that is Gintama. Its nice and relaxed, will be both surprising and predictable, yes, predictable, like this movie, and that my friends, is the amazing thing. You see, Gintama can Actually turn its predictability into a positive, actually making it work better for them. So you can imagine how happy I was to see a movie coming out for it. It was magnificent, majestic...well, just read on.<br />
<br />
STORY - 9/10<br />
<br />
Let me start out with the negative. This movie is completely and utterly predictable. Half the movie is anyway, and somehow, that actually makes it better. The predictability is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review135171">
        all because of the Shounen aspect of the anime, it is just how a shounen will flow, but the comedy while not quite perfect as it was in the first and second series, was still near perfect. Let us get this straight, no man can truly say that Gintama has a perfect story, as it does not, and never will. A story Will destroy it, massacre it. Its okay if its only a couple of eps or 1 movie, but not as a series. The movie adapts the characters well, and the story while obvious, is quite enjoyable. And who the hell cares about that, the story does not matter! THE COMEDY HERE IS WHAT MATTERS, and gintama delivers!<br />
<br />
Art/Animation - 10/10<br />
<br />
Ah, the art. Well, this takes place in a kinda feudal Japan with alien tech, so you can imagine. The art itself is like rainbows to the eyes, magnificent and shining brightly, but only so to show you its pure perfectness. This could have the worst art, and yet would still be a feast to the eyes, cause of the way it is then put in. Lots of scenes are not in the best art style, because thats what it need. The thing is with Gintama, the flaws you see will nearly always be an actual positive, and that is why the art is so good. Many anime have art better than this, but you will still see the art get a higher score here than on those anime.<br />
<br />
Sound - 10/10<br />
<br />
Not much to say. The sound was perfect, voice actors, oh, I would pay y&#039;all a $100000 dollars if you never quit(Dont take this literally thank you) and the sound effects...well, they were right. Not good, not bad, normal, So just give it full marks there.<br />
<br />
Characters - ∞/10<br />
<br />
How has Gintama survived so well without a story. Well, Ill give you the answer. The CHARACTERS! You see, the characters in Gintama are incredibly Perfect. No matter who it is, every character has a role to play once, and a crucial role. You&#039;ll remember them, if they come back, you&#039;ll know them, and when you see them, you only get happier. The characters are not possible, they are that good, and yet, there they are, providing you with the greatest cast in the world. Someone shout out something bad about them, Ill turn it the other way around. No matter what you say, I can prove you wrong when it comes to the characters. No matter how small, they make you happy, no matter how insignificant, they make you laugh, and no matter how little they are there, you love them.<br />
<br />
Overall - ∞/10...Fine, 10/10<br />
<br />
You see, I know no matter what I say, there will always be a person who hates it, even if they don&#039;t have a reason, and I respect your choice. But for those who haven&#039;t watched this or the series, please, give it a go. For once, it&#039;s not killing your time, its actually enjoying it. Every moment is pure bliss, and I do not kid here. For me and My older brother, when we finished this, it felt like a part of our life died. It kinda did. It was an empty feeling, one so bad, Ive only ever felt it when someone in my family died...okay, not really that bad, but that&#039;s how much Ill exaggerate it. Any of you read a series called THe Power of Five by Anthony Horrowitz? No? Read it, finish it, if you enjoyed it, you will feel the empty feeling I speak of. So with this anime, if you enjoy it, brace yourself, I don&#039;t know why, no anime can do that to me, but it just felt so bad, so empty, thats how much I enjoyed this, how good it was.
