    What is right and wrong? Who decides this anyway? When the time comes, will you do things based on what you think is right, or what other people say is?<br />
<br />
When I first started watching this, it was some form of a &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; decision, while I thought it was going to be just another under-developed hentai (or half-hentai, as I used to call it). I was very pleasantly surprised.<br />
Believe me, this is NOT a hentai. Yes, the main character does have sex with multiple girls over the course of the series, but these scenes have a meaning. More important thing is how they got to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32936">
        it, the story behind each girl, more than just the act of having sex.<br />
<br />
This was made after a visual novel, so it&#039;s reasonable that every girl gets a story. Still, in this anime, stories are seperated from each other and only in the last arc, some of the elements from other ones come together. It is obvious that every story, a lot of things change related to each other, but I think it would be more correct to say that the only thing that&#039;s really changed is one: the main character.<br />
<br />
One of the main reasons why I started watching this anime, was the art. Everything was done fluid and crisp; I equally enjoyed watching the nature and surroundings, and... hmm... body parts. (lol) The people seem real, and the girls are differently built (I really hate it when in anime, all girls look the same). The endings of each episode are made using chibi art, with normal one only used during a ecchi scene. I thought Akira&#039;s enourmous chibi head was hilarious, though xD<br />
<br />
Sound is great too, both voice actors and music. The background music was done nicely, and it didn&#039;t feel weird in any part.<br />
<br />
In the beginning, the characters seem chiched and boring: tsundere girl, meganekko slut, awkward class president, childish/mature girl convo... but at the end almost every character has depth.<br />
During the different timelines, as Haruka&#039;s personality changes for a little, girls&#039; personalities change a little too. Maybe out of jealousy, the non-main girls become much less likeable than they are in their own arc, even though it is made that the personalities are believable: they didn&#039;t change the essence, only circumstances.<br />
<br />
Haruka is a main character out of the cliche from the very beginning. Even though he isn&#039;t one of the typical male harem leads, he seems a little too perfect; nice and charming, so much that all the girls love him. Though, he is a &quot;Prince Charming&quot; only on the surface; when the time comes for it, he becomes undecisive and weak. The thing changing over the acrs isn&#039;t only the girl he likes, it&#039;s his personality as well. Even though, in the end, he always stays the same.<br />
<br />
Sora is a troubled girl, so much that you can&#039;t actually hate her, even if you try. She is clingy, moody, dishonest and insecure, maybe because of the time spent at a hospital that made her delicate like a doll. But, unlike Haru, she knows exactly what she wants and doesn&#039;t care what others&#039;ll think about it. And it is, being with Haru.<br />
<br />
Aside from the main arc&#039;s, the other timelines&#039; heroines were likeable too: at the start, Nao seems annoying for some reason, but every time there is a need, whichever timeline, she is there to help like an older sister of some sort. Akira reminds me of those theather masks that only have smile on them: regardless the situation, she will mask everything with a smile. Kazuha tries and tries to be like a strict older sister, despite her real gentle personality.<br />
<br />
The order of arcs was the backwards one of my enjoyment as well. I liked the Kazuha one the least, Akira a little more, and so. Motoka chibis in the ending were hilarious, too.<br />
<br />
If insecure, try to make the best decision possible. At the end, at least one person must be hurt, and that is the natural course of things. When loving someone, you shouldn&#039;t care what other people think or say. That&#039;s what I think, at least!<br />
<br />
I enjoyed this &quot;half-hentai&quot; a lot more than I previously thought. :)

    First of all, lets make things clear. THERE ARE SEX SCENES WITHIN THIS SERIES!! and this component usually makes people want to simply watch this series as a hentai. If you are planning on doing so, you will be trading a GREAT anime with a HORRIBLE hentai because those scenes are short and not very exciting. Instead, the sex scenes create an unique mood for the story development.<br />
<br />
Story 9/10 Yosuga no sora was originally a PC visual novel, this means that the story cannot possibly lack content. The story is very unique, instead of having a million girls liking the main character at the same

          <span style="display: none;" id="review56237">
        time, the story focuses on one heroine for a few episodes then goes back to a &quot;save point&quot; and starts a new story with the next one. <br />
<br />
I have to split the art part into two.<br />
<br />
General art (how the characters look) 8/10<br />
Mood art (what makes the current situation or story more interesting)10/10    The art of this anime is capable of completely expressing the character&#039;s feelings. The artist is not simply making the characters blush and changing the eyes and eyebrows to express a character&#039;s emotions. Instead, the artist uses the body language of the characters. ( the way a character is standing, sitting, lying down, getting f**ked) <br />
<br />
Sound 9/10 The voice acting for most characters is very satisfying.<br />
The background music and sounds were generally good. ( with a few scenes that have great background music and sounds) The opening is one of my favorite anime openings. The op song beautifully expresses the general feeling of this anime.<br />
<br />
Character 10/10 In general (because I might flood the review with my own opinions and lower the quality since i have too much to say）The character portrayal is great, partially thanks to the art; each character has a very unique and attractive personality which also makes the individuality of the characters extremely strong. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10 The only thing holding me back from giving this series a 10/10 for enjoyment is the intense conflicts made one episode seem very long and made me want to take a break. Which is also the reason this anime is enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Overall 9/10<br />
<br />
I would suggest this series to everyone, especially people who likes interesting conflicts and romance.<br />
<br />
PS: The visual novel is still much better so why not give the VN a chance while you&#039;re at it. Both the art and music are amazing and the stories are more developed in the VN :D<br />

    I love &#039;Yosuga no Sora&#039;.<br />
<br />
Be it the soft-hentai or if its the story itself.<br />
<br />
Many people cannot get over the fact that there is lack of character development and class and as such.<br />
But, I don&#039;t think that is the main point of &#039;Yosuga no Sora&#039;.<br />
<br />
Its last episode especially.<br />
It lets an individual judge what is &#039;Right&#039; and what is &#039;Wrong&#039;.<br />
To be judged by others that it is &#039;Wrong&#039; or to stay true to yourself.<br />
<br />
After all, it is &#039;Incest&#039;. Not every individual is able to adapt to the idea itself.<br />
But, the irony comes in whereby, <br />
<br />
&quot;Is it wrong to stay true to whom you love?&quot;<br />
Or is it &#039;Right&#039;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review51847">
        to lie to yourself and be judged &#039;Correctly&#039; by society itself.<br />
<br />
Not everyone is capable of answering the above question or even comfortable with it.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s where the anime also comes in, as it refines and indicates your own views on that is &#039;Right&#039; and what is &#039;Wrong&#039; to you.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I am very open-minded. And I welcome all kinds of &#039;Love&#039; and am not affected by the very society I live, if not, we live in.<br />
I can answer the question easily.<br />
<br />
I rather stay true to whom I love than lie to myself. Even if its Incest.

    Normally I don&#039;t review series, even if I really love them, but one very negative review on this series that I bumped into prompted me to want to give it as much credit as possible. <br />
<br />
I am a 18 year old girl. I love anime, but I&#039;m not anti-social or any other stereotype that really fits otaku. I have plenty of friends who think anime in general is weird. And I, possibly the most &#039;normal&#039; out of all my otaku friends, LOVED this anime.<br />
<br />
The art is amazing. especially when contrasted with the characters. I adored how they made the lead male a bishi without having

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32950">
        his character be a total soft-hearted pussy, like they do in almost every harem anime I&#039;ve ever seen!<br />
<br />
That being said, normally I don&#039;t even go for harem anime, but this one was very... sincere? I think that&#039;s a good way to put it. It really made the best of each arch, so that I felt good and satisfied when the happy ending was reached for each pairing. Even the twincest arch, which I&#039;d never have pinned myself as being a particular fan of.<br />
<br />
On top of all this, the voice acting is very high quality. A lot of the time, what I find in more obscure anime, especially ones like this, is that they supplement their budget by having crappy voice actors. Not Yosuga no Sora. The voice acting was actually very noticeably better than even some mainstream stuff out there.<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;d say the rating should depend on what you&#039;re looking for. When I try to rate anime, I do it based on how someone looking for that genre would rate it. Like, I wouldn&#039;t grade Code Geass by the same criteria I would grade Princess Princess. So, that being taken into account, this is an awesome series for those who can go into it with an open mind, and look at the good qualities. The soft-core porn is just a bonus XP<br />

    Once again, I&#039;m reviewing another garbage incest anime. Why do I keep doing this to myself? I have no idea honestly. This time I&#039;ll be looking at Yosuga no Sora, an adaptation of a shitty visual novel that for some reason was helmed by the director/writer duo that brought us Spice and Wolf! <br />
<br />
So why on Earth is there SOO much brother/sister incest media in Japan? I&#039;ve thought a lot about this question over the years and I have a theory. Japan has one of the lowest birthrates in the world. Unsurprisingly, there are many single child households. For some of these geeky, horny, only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review392759">
        sons there is an appeal in the cute little sister character. Mostly because they have no idea what it&#039;s actually like to have a little sister. In these fantasies, the little sister is the ultimate example of a non-threatening girlfriend. She adores her big brother and worships the ground he walks on. She will obey his every command without question. Most importantly, he doesn&#039;t need to actually go out and find a girlfriend and risk being embarrassed on the dating scene. Little sister already knows all of your likes and dislikes. You don&#039;t need to explain anything or have any communication skills whatsoever! <br />
<br />
Believe it or not, this was actually not Takeo Takahashi&#039;s first time directing incest porn. Immediately after Spice and Wolf ended in September of 2009, Takahashi directed the hentai Aki no Sora just 2 months later! I guess he has to bring home the bacon somehow! This time in Yosuga no Sora, he roped in his friend Naruhisa Arakawa to provide the screenplay. Arakawa did an incredible job with Spice and Wolf, so of course Takahashi wanted his talent in adapting this wonderful eroge!<br />
<br />
Yosuga no Sora is the story of an absolute horn dog that moves out into the country with his twin sister. The anime decides to adapt every route from the dating sim into 12 episodes, so starting at episode 4 he&#039;s banging one chick after another. The series is most infamous for him winding up with his sister at the end, but he bangs 3 other girls as well if you aren&#039;t into the whole incest thing. Does this anime pull a School Days and also end with a Nice Boat? The answer is no, he actually lives happily with his sister and they have a kid together in the VN. A child that will have a 50 percent chance of an early death due to a severe birth defect, but who cares about that?<br />
<br />
The most critically acclaimed incest anime is easily Koi Kaze. That title doesn&#039;t intend to be pornographic. It intends to challenge your morality and make you question why you oppose incest? Is it for religious reasons or genetic reasons? Yosuga no Sora is not about deep questions. It&#039;s about fapping. Lots of shameless fapping. That is until it suddenly takes a hard right turn and the MC starts crying while banging his sister and realizing how fucked up it is. She talks about getting an abortion if she gets pregnant, but he slaps her for suggesting that they terminate their love child. Um...did you guys forget you&#039;ve been writing a porn for the last 8 episodes? Nothing kills erections faster than serious conversations on the morality of abortion. They also attempt to commit double suicide by drowning, but they wake up on the shore because some unknown person saved them offscreen. Considering how deep they were underwater before the scene cut away, I assume it was supposed to be an act of God. So according to this anime, God really wants this brother and sister to fuck! Then again, according to the Abrahamic Faiths, it was God who made an old Jewish dude have sex with his 2 daughters after turning that dude&#039;s wife into a pillar of salt. God does some unusual things in the Book of Genesis, which is called &quot;Bereshit&quot; in the original Hebrew.<br />
<br />
Speaking of shit, back to our anime. The whole anime ends with most of the characters disgusted at MC except for one girl who thinks free love should be limitless and sister is just a word while age is just a number. If this was supposed to be an emotional and moving speech, it failed HARD! <br />
<br />
At least the anime does have some nice titty bounces and isn&#039;t the worst looking thing in the world. This production was brought to us by Studio Feel who also animated Kiss x Sis. On a technical level this anime isn&#039;t bad, which is why I gave it such a generous score.<br />
<br />
Should you watch Yosuga no Sora? HELL NO! Even if you&#039;re morbidly interested, it&#039;s really not worth it! If you just want to watch some brother x sister fucking, I&#039;d recommend Aki no Sora over this on the grounds that it&#039;s much shorter.

    This review contains spoilers.<br />
<br />
When I started this I was expecting something average , truly, since I did not know anything about the anime, not even the fact that it was a harem, and even less the fact that it was based on a porn game, but when I learned that, it did not stop me from at least giving this anime a chance, and sadly, I did. It turned out to be a major waste of time and being seriously nothing more than your average soft-core hentai harem. <br />
<br />
story(3/10): I know it is quite controversial to give such a low score on something like that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32997">
        but I was frankly expecting more from the story. The story itself can be resumed to basically some guy with an awful lot of sex appeal (like any other harem hero) who nails girls one after another in a village (lets not forget the part which was based on the game, which gives us some kind of alternate ending for each girl...). I&#039;m not criticizing the actual story that much but rather its content, it was generic, repetitive, clichéd and destroyed the very essence of the &#039;&#039;romance&#039;&#039; genre it was suppose to be.<br />
<br />
art (5/10): The art wasn&#039;t that bad actually and would merit a better score than 5, but the forced 3d animation inserted was obviously done by some amateur or had very little budget associated to its production, thus lowering the score.<br />
<br />
sound (3/10): The voice acting itself was not that horrible, though some voices did tend to get on my nerve (the sisters voice for instance). The real downside to the sound was the repetitive background with a range of 3 or 4  instruments maximum (and an excessive use of the piano/violin). <br />
<br />
characters (5/10): The characters wouldn&#039;t have been half bad if it would have been another style of anime and not a romance one, which focuses the whole plot around the actual character development and the interaction of one with another. That part of the anime was actually pretty boring since the characters were all passing the same developments almost in the same order (likes the main character, relationship, problem, reconciliation , sex).<br />
<br />
enjoyment (2/10): I can&#039;t say i have enjoyed this anime at all. It was long, repetitive and boring, but I must say i have laughed hard in the eleventh episode when i actually saw the overly incestuous couple get caught... and the incest kinda did not help to the enjoyment factor, if your into that kind of stuff, i suggest you watch episode 10/11/12... what you do while watching that is your own damn thing.<br />
<br />
overall: 3/10 Overall, this was a pretty bad anime, it was nothing but soft core hentai, and if your really into hentai then its not even for you since its too censored. either way, i don&#039;t think this will please people who like romance, since its a harem and they are commonly known to massacre the genre with each episode. plus i don&#039;t even think it will satisfy the hentai lovers since its too censored. in the end, this is only something for the pure hardcore lovers of the genre...

    I am at lost for words for this anime.. Hmm.. Give me a moment. Ok now, I  was expecting this to be a harem themed anime but unfortunately, the whole &quot;Give each girl a seperate arc&quot; theme that Amagami SS brought in ruined the whole harem genre. However, at least this new style killed many &quot;THIS IS GOING TO END LIKE SCHOOL DAYS!&quot; trolls along with it.<br />
<br />
Story 6/10<br />
Believe it or not this actually have a story to it! And a pretty decent one too! However if you&#039;re a pacifist then Im sure you&#039;ll enjoy it because it deals with a lot of negative emotions

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33119">
        surrounding the characters. <br />
<br />
And did I mention Incest? Yes, like many Autumn line up this year, this one is incest themed, but only for the final arc. Most probably if you read the other reviews, they would have given a low rating due to &quot;promoting incestuous relationship&quot;<br />
Hey, Im ok with incest, Im ok with homosexuality, but I am definetely not ok with Incestuous homosexuals! (Luckily for me, this anime has none)<br />
<br />
Back to the story, every important girl in this anime is given the arc, even the maid in her little amusing chibi skit. (Except for the class president. WHY DOESN&#039;T ANYONE LIKE HER!) And in each arc, Haru here, a.k.a Mr I Dont Know How To Lock Doors When Having Sex, will get down (No not that geddan spastic dance) with each girl. I think that&#039;s another reason why most people (including me) gave it a bad review. The sex scene was so unexpected an really... REALLY.. not needed. But does make up for a good fanservice and I know a lot of you pervert out there ain&#039;t complaining.<br />
<br />
Art 7/10<br />
Like any visual novel adapted into an anime, art is one important aspect. Basically, I would even watch an anime with cruddy story plot if the art is outstanding (Which reminds me of Shukufu no Campbella) Nevertheless, the art is one of the positive side about this anime. It is exceptionally well done.<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10<br />
Besides the sound of girls moaning and Haru having sex, the choice of BGM for each scene is quite melancholic. I definitely would be adding this anime OST to my list.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
Like every harem, each girl has their own unique set of.. Urmm.. racks...<br />
Forget about that. Each girl portrays one of the many fetishes modern day otakus have. There&#039;s a gothic like lolicon. There&#039;s a cheerful miko. There&#039;s a glasses girl (Seriously, glasses? I still dont understand the sexual attraction on this one) There&#039;s a high class lady girl, and there;s even a maid! (Sorry but no props to the class president)<br />
And the head of all this girls is the harem boss himself, Haru a.k.a &quot;He Who Definitely Never Watched Porn Before In His Life Thus He Doesnt Know How To Lock Doors But How Come He Knows All Those Sex Positions!&quot; <br />
Wow thats a mouthful.<br />
Haru as all male harem leads is a kind boy who haven&#039;t seen his sister for a very long time and thus use that an excuse to have incestuous relationship with her. Damn, that was genius, I wish I would have known that excuse a long time ago!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 6/10<br />
Sorry but I would have given a higher rating if it weren&#039;t for all those sex scene that ruined the rewatch value. Trust me, if you wanna fap I suggest you do it with REAL hentai, not this anime. Its ECCHI but not HENTAI<br />
<br />
Overall 6/10<br />
I dont think any of the female anime viewers would enjoy watching this anime. Even some male viewers are dissing it. I mean c&#039;mon. Tachibana from Amagami SS needed 4 episodes to even kiss a girl (Well some are slightly earlier) but Haru here just needs 1 episode to get laid with her? <br />
Anyways Im not here to judge on your anime preference. If you like fanservice, then by all mean GO WATCH IT!<br />
If you love loli figures, then by all mean ONLY WATCH SORA&#039;S ARC<br />
But if you wanna touch yourself at night, go grab a decent hentai, will you?<br />
<br />
Haremu Kingu,<br />

    &#039;Yosuga no Sora&#039; (&#039;Sora the Blood Relative&#039;) is an anime adaptation for an eroge. Like any sane person, I don&#039;t support incest nor particularly have an infatuation with sister characters (although I find it funny when sisters get raped in hentai), but decided to check this out because I have seen an extremely moving and thought-provoking Japanese incest movie before: &#039;Boku wa Imoto ni Koi wo Suru&#039; (2007)<br />
Unfortunately, this was an extremely shallow series in comparison.<br />
<br />
<br />
I&#039;m sure we&#039;re all wondering what those insect antennas are doing on almost every character&#039;s hair in this series. It must have surpassed &#039;Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto&#039; as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32967">
        series with dumbest ahoge in history. But other than that, the characters are very visually attractive, and hands and feet are drawn with more detail and better proportion than most anime series around.<br />
<br />
I must commend the art in this series, not because of its detail or style, but because of its revolutionary distribution of animation budget. A typical show goes like this: 1:00 flashback, 1:30 OP, 17:30 content, 1:30 ED1, 2:00 side story, 1:30ED2 for 25-minute ad-free air time. The side story has super-simplistic backgrounds with chibi-form characters, which is a lot easier to draw and saves money/time. What this and having two EDs per episode has allowed, is only 17:30 of actual content per show instead of standard 22:00. The shorter actual content in combined with heavy recycling of backgrounds has enabled very beautiful character appearance and animation despite the apparent small budget.<br />
<br />
This is damaging to the art consistency and content, but fortunately this series didn&#039;t have much material to begin with, and leaves much better impression than average quality overall.<br />
<br />
Voice acting was pretty good, everyone sounded like they should.<br />
BGM was also pretty good with nostalgic, gentle pieces that complimented the visuals in creating a peaceful countryside atmosphere.<br />
The theme songs were extremely weak, I would&#039;ve expected more from Eufonius, but the song sounded tiring as Riya was trying and failing to hit the high keys. Two EDs were very forgettable.<br />
<br />
<br />
The opening act was the worst episode 1 I&#039;ve ever seen. It served as an introduction to the main couple&#039;s relationship and other girls he would eventually tap, but it presented itself as a shallow harem right off the bat. All the girls basically fall in love at first sight without apparent reasons. It&#039;s also difficult to imagine countryside girls would dig a bishounen type.<br />
Other girls back off after that though, and the main character goes after them one by one. The story in this series has a eroge-like save function where the protagonist chooses different paths and play out what would&#039;ve happened had he chosen differently. It&#039;s kind of interesting, but unfortunately, the whole concept tumbled when heroines acted completely different in each arc. For example, Sora accepts Haruka and Nao&#039;s relationship in one arc, but in the following one, she becomes so mentally unstable that the previous arc&#039;s ending could&#039;ve never happened.<br />
<br />
It was also difficult to see why the protagonist would go after each girl. In &#039;Amagami SS&#039;, they at least attempt to explain this by who the protagonist walks into immediately after a life-altering event. Here, the main character seemed to just go after them because he had to (the scriptwriter forced him to).<br />
<br />
The characters are of course the typical harem archetypes, and there&#039;s nothing wrong with that, but they never grew out of their cardboard cutout existence. Every girl would suddenly share a devastating past trauma to the main character, and then make out with him after he somehow solve their problems. Character development here just seemed to be manufactured to get us to sympathize with heroines, and feels like we&#039;re just supposed to go along with it. This is a blatant sign of poor story writing, because such issues should be uncovered natural enough or the story should be so engaging that we won&#039;t even notice such details if done right.<br />
<br />
The chemistry between the main couple were seen in other heroine&#039;s arcs, and it&#039;s somewhat understandable that they would eventually commit incestuous act given their mutual feelings and couple of awkward events between the two. However, issues such as morality and love surrounding incest was never explored in this series, and in the end, it just seemed like lust, and they even make up a half-assed excuse that this is okay because they have been apart for so long that they see each other as strangers rather than siblings. This defeats the whole point of this series being incest themed, and whatever point they made after that seemed to be superfluous.<br />
<br />
<br />
&#039;Yosuga no Sora&#039;, unlike &#039;Amagami SS&#039;, presented itself as a thought-provoking and controversial incest themed series with foreshadowing of the main couple&#039;s relationship with all the &quot;restarts&quot;. But in the end, it failed to fulfill its own promise, and turned into yet another shallow romance anime more suited for hentai. If you&#039;re looking for a deep incest drama, you won&#039;t find it here. Less than average series, less than hentai.

    I think a more appropriate name for this series, to try to avoid being profane, would be &quot;The Screwing Haru Show&quot; considering how this show is set. Pretty much, the series is set up in several arcs that involve male lead Haruka hooking up with one of several girls, resolving some sort of dramatic element with them and then inevitably having intercourse with them at the end of the arc with events reset afterward to feature the cycle repeating with another girl acquainted with Haruka. The series is pretty much an excuse to have Haruka engage in softcore sexual action with the &quot;girl of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review77195">
        arc&quot; as the personalities of each gal are pretty archetypal and plot scenarios being anything you would see done to death from an eroge game. The show is so ignorant of providing enough fleshing out and development of its characters, especially with its &quot;resets&quot; after each arc, that the series will have you caring more for the sex in it than whatever convoluted drama the series cooks up for the relationships that Haruka gets into.<br />

The worst of these arcs was with the final one involving Sora as, regrettably, the show features an arc where Haruka commits to an incestuous fling with his twin sister. This combines the two normal issues to be expected with featuring incest in an anime title as it features melodramatic trappings and a cheap excuse to feature perverted/ sexual rompings with the twin fraternal siblings. Don&#039;t even think this is as tasteful and sensible as Koi Kaze in believably exploring incest.<br />
<br />
The series also includes a dull attempt at comedy with an omake mini-episode at the end of each episode to Yosuga no Sora featuring some older maid trying to hook up with Haruka. The fact we see maid gal masturbating in the first mini-episode of the series didn&#039;t have my hopes up of even caring for what would take place in it.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can generally praise with Yosuga no Sora would be its visuals as they featured well-detailed character designs, beautiful shots of scenery and vibrant colors, which are only downturned by the title&#039;s subpar frame rate within a number of animated shots.<br />
<br />
Overall, Yosuga no Sora is just another cheap ecchi title for the otaku crowd to go googly-eyed for. Anyone expecting anything more tasteful, in-depth and sensible with their content should avoid this dud like the plague.

    Who is to say who we can and can not love?<br />
<br />
Normally I never really feel the pull to review a series, but not even finishing the series less then 10 minutes ago, I really felt I should write a review. Please note this is my first review, so either negative or positive feedback is greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;m not going to lie, the first thing that pulled me into Yosuga no Sora was the fact there were twins and incest involved. Incest in anime and manga has always been one of my guilty pleasures so I really couldn&#039;t help but watch it. I came into this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33327">
        anime not expecting a lot and boy, did it surprise me. <br />
<br />
The first thing that caught my eye was the art and animation. It just seemed so real. The characters moved.. swiftly. The characters and the background had such a real feel to me that I could have thought it was a live action show. Of course, that is very much an exaggeration but I was really pleased by the animation. Everything was also so pretty too, I couldn&#039;t help but be mesmerized. It really is better then most I see nowadays. I mean, Yosuga isn&#039;t perfect, it has its faults here and there but nothing really stood out to me to make me complain. Even the softcore hentai scenes were played out nice, I think. <br />
<br />
I was really pleased with the music as well. I thought the opening theme was really catchy and it set the mood for the anime nicely. It was a really mellow tune. The ending theme was really nice too. Both of those songs are songs I could catch myself listening to out of pure entertainment. And the background music to the anime was really clean. Other words to describe it would be beautiful.. gentle.. and never a touch out of place. None of it annoyed me and I found it to be quite a joy to listen to!  The voice actors I really enjoyed too. I thought each voice fit its&#039; character perfectly. Really, I was pleasantly surprised.<br />
<br />
Now, you could say that the girls were kind of stereotyped. But again, each character turned out real. They each had their own stories and feelings and personalities. The girls mostly stayed the same with each different arc I thought, except Sora of course. I definitely felt Sora&#039;s feelings were growing stronger and stronger within each arc but I always sort of felt that she knew what she wanted. I was actually very satisfied with Haruka. He was totally cute ( &gt;.&gt; ;; ) and he was really kind. Somehow I couldn&#039;t help but think of Makoto Itou... Oh Makoto.. Anyways, Haru was kind and responsible, always caring for Sora. I guess he really isn&#039;t your typical guy, but he kind of is. He&#039;s really perfect on the surface, but he has his own faults as well. Sora.. wasn&#039;t how I expected her to be. Going into the series I didn&#039;t read any character descriptions or anything, I kind of just jumped right in. From her looks, I thought she would be shy and sweet.. but she really can be quite selfish and rude. But she does have her sweet side! So I couldn&#039;t help but love her though.. Again, I really enjoyed most of the characters, granted Nao-chan got kind of annoying for me..<br />
<br />
The story was kind of typical too. Watching it, I couldn&#039;t help but think of School Days. But this anime was definitely not School Days, especially the ending. Looking at this anime I thought almost instantly of harem. Normally, I don&#039;t really like harems. I&#039;m more of a reverse harem kind of person, but because of my incest fetish.. I couldn&#039;t help but watch. Yosuga seemed to me.. so much more then a harem. Each girl got her own arc, so to speak, and each were very meaningful. Yes, Haru does have sex with most of these girls, but I found them to be truly touching and not just meaningless sex. This really was kind of softcore hentai, I was actually surprised. More pleased actually, since I admit I do watch my fair share of hentai...  I thought it was nice to have a real series that showed some of those parts and not just skipped ahead and such.. but that just may be the pervert inside of me... &gt; .&gt; ;; But again, this is not a hentai. Again, with the repeating story and the repeating festival that happened, my mind could not help but think of Higurashi.. That Wataganashi Festival will be forever branded in my mind... O_O Unfortunately, we weren&#039;t blessed with any murder here! Well.. I don&#039;t think my heart would&#039;ve taken it if any of the characters died.. I liked them.. &gt; .&gt; ;;<br />
<br />
All in all, I really enjoyed this anime. I hope I don&#039;t seemed too biased as it seems to me I was just praising this series from the beginning. Yosuga does have its faults. I mean, it can be looked at as a typical harem.. and not to mention the controversial topic of incest, or more so twincest. Frankly, I was very pleased with the ending, since it was the one I was rooting for all along. And again, normally I&#039;m not a fan of harems. I usually just have one or two girls I like and the rest of the girls I just find to be an annoyance.. But I found myself liking basically every one of these characters, granted Nao-chan. ( Okay I admit, Nao-chan wasn&#039;t even that bad... ^.^ ) <br />
<br />
So for you &quot;deciding to watch&quot; people, if you really like a bit of touching stories, with a little bit of harem, and a dash of incest, ( Okay, more like a scoop? ) then you might as well give Yosuga no Sora a chance. I think this series will definitely be on my re-watch list. But if you don&#039;t like romance, harems, ecchi, or incest, then maybe you should shy away. But I think if you give Yosuga no Sora a chance, you might even be a little surprised!<br />
<br />
( Again, this is my first review! Any feedback would be appreciated~ )<br />

    Ok, before I start making my review on Yosuga no Sora, I like to point out that this is indeed my first review on an anime. Hopefully my review about this anime will have an effect on whether you watch it or not; and hopefully you don&#039;t, because believe me; youfre just wasting your time. Also, I recommend those who actually &quot;liked&quot; this anime to not read this review, it&#039;ll probably just turn your day upside down. Overall, this anime is one of the worse anime I have ever seen, only topped by School Days.<br />
I personally feel sorry for the producer who released and aired

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32948">
        this anime. They must have either been drunk and got tricked into airing/releasing this, or must have run out of ideas and had no other choice but to summit this.<br />
<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
Now if you&#039;ve read the synopsis you get a little summary of it, but that doesn&#039;t really explain much, because this anime doesn&#039;t even have a story. The twins, which are the 2 main characters, lost their parents in an accident. First of all, it was never revealed to how the parents died. And later they apparently moved in with their grandfather who never even made a screen appearance.<br />
During the first half or maybe a little further into the anime, it was more of an arc anime. Each and every girl Haru bangs gets a little side story, but when it got to the Nao arcc ohh man... I just felt as if they gave up on this anime.<br />
Ok... now I know very well that this is rated gR+ - Mild Nudityh, but damn, did they have to add in a sex scenes for every episodes? I thought this was a TV series, not a hentai. They practically turned this anime into a hentai OVA series.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
This is probably the only damn thing good about this anime. Personally I have no problem with the art... There was actually some nice scenery; I really think they did a good job on the backgrounds and locations. But as for the nude shots... ugh... I got sick of seeing it after a few times.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
Now the sounds weren&#039;t too bad. The OP was by eufonius, which I happen to listen to from time to time. As for EDs.. I can&#039;t even remember them, and I probably wouldn&#039;t want to. As for the sex sounds, Ifm glad they restrained themselves from letting out to many groans and moans, because this is a TV series and not a hentai. As for the voice acting, I didn&#039;t have a problem with that. Most of the characters voices were to my liking.<br />
<br />
Character: 2/10<br />
Oh god... I don&#039;t even want to mention the characters. Personally, the only character I liked was the stuffed rabbit that Sora carried around. It just goes to show how much I hated the characters from this anime.<br />
Haruka ? The main male lead of the whole series. Hefs not worthy to mention because all he does is go around having sex with girls.<br />
Sora ? Harukafs twin sister. She wasn&#039;t bad at all during the first half of the series, but then the Nao arc came along which changed my whole opinion on her.<br />
Akira - It was revealed in her arc that she was the daughter of the Migiwa head family, which makes her Kazuha half older sister. I actually thought she was pretty cutec until, Haruka showed up in her lifec -.-<br />
Kazuha - Daughter of the Migiwa head family. Not much was really mentioned about her. Except the fact that she met Haruka on first day he moved back.<br />
Nao - Oh god... I hated her most in this series. not much about her was likable.. matter of fact, there was none.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2/10<br />
You really think I can enjoy this? Well, I&#039;m not saying Ifm not the type to watch soft hentai or ecchi, but to have every episode include a sex scene is somewhat pushing it. Personally, I really hated this anime. I didn&#039;t feel the slightest bit of enjoyment and it was honestly bad. My friends and I could probably make a better anime.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2/10<br />
Finally, herefs what I think overall:<br />
Crap + Waste of time + Shitty Plot = Yosuga no Sora

    If you&#039;re not a hormonal teenager and you enjoy this anime i am concerned about your well being, and if you are, i hope you eventually grow out of it.<br />
<br />
Basically all you need to know is:<br />
The porn is terrible.<br />
The story in even worse.<br />
<br />
If you wanna hear the long version here it is:<br />
<br />
The anime is basically the whole plot revolving around excuses for the main character to hook up with every girl in the series in different arcs, every plot point is suspiciously convenient for the protagonist to play the hero, feed his savior complex and do just enough to get a coochie pass with each

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378807">
        one of the girls. The stories are boring and tired and every character is one dimensional, archetypical and very artificial.<br />
<br />
It makes an attempt to mask this very obvious damisel in distress fetish as art, throwing a couple of emotional scenes and making the porn scenes seem cute and wholesome but they end up looking cheap as the emotional investment and likeability of the characters is next to none.<br />
<br />
I also find it kind of creepy and unsettling that nothing ever happens on screen or off screen that isn&#039;t directly related to the story, there aren&#039;t even any background characters walking around save for maybe like 5 students and a teacher, the world just feels very fabricated and fake, as if it all existed inside inside a snow globe, like we&#039;re just watching the degenerate anime version of The Truman Show.<br />
<br />
Anyways, if i had to say anything positive about this, the art is decent for it&#039;s budget and the soundtrack is serviceable.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t watch this, not even as a meme.

    I was first drawn to Yosuga no Sora by its poster. It stood out in the Fall 2010 anime preview, where every other series used every color of the rainbow to grab the audience&#039;s attention, this series had a rather simple depicting of Haru and Sora under a blue sky. <br />
<br />
The expressions of the characters reminded me a bit of &quot;ef - a tale of memories&quot;, &quot;True Tears&quot; and other romantic anime that weren&#039;t also part comedy. My favorite genre is romance and I had high hopes going into this series. Unfortunately in this case, the old axiom of &#039;never judge a book by its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32981">
        cover&#039; proved itself true.<br />
<br />
<br />
====== Story ======<br />
When I read the series synopsis, I came in expecting a serious story, perhaps even tragic in its setup. In contrast, the problems the characters dealt with in the series felt very trivial, adolescent even in importance. Only in Sora&#039;s arc did I feel that the characters were ever dealing with a true issue, not one so easily solved in an afternoon&#039;s worth under the sheets. Ultimately, I would describe the storyline as shallow at best, but perhaps this is what was intended. Those looking for a deeper storyline as was alluded to in the synopsis will only find disappointment here.<br />
<br />
<br />
===== Art =====<br />
The character designs in the anime were well drawn out, with proportions that closely resembled real people. There were varying levels in consistency from episode to episode in how the characters were drawn; it seemed that as the series wore on, some scenes revealed poor animation. Expressions were not as detailed or varied as one would have hoped, given the anime relies so strongly on character interaction. The backgrounds were weak to average at best. They looked very 2D to me, with low attention to detail. It seems as if the artists did just enough each scene to make it work, but nothing to make it stand out. <br />
<br />
===== Sound =====<br />
One constant throughout the series was the great soundtrack that helped to set the mood. Especially in the more serious scenes, the music felt very appropriate to what was happening on-screen and really helped convey whatever emotions the characters were feeling. Beyond simply setting the mood, the music was beautiful to listen to, I found myself listening more to the music in certain scenes than the voices. Both the OP and initial ED were well done, fitting the series quite well. <br />
<br />
===== Characters =====<br />
Perhaps it was due to only having a 13 episode season, but outside of Sora and Haru, the relationships between characters were not convincing at all. Characters felt very static, as they changed little throughout their respective arcs.<br />
<br />
===== Conclusion =====<br />
The main selling point of this series is the amount of skin that is shown. The story of the show is very weak, especially in earlier arcs and there is little redemption to be found in the characters; I would go so far as to say some of them were even annoying in how often they changed their moods or worried about problems that weren&#039;t really problems at all. If the promise of incest is enough to keep you watching despite these problems, then I would cautiously recommend Yosuga no Sora.<br />

        I just want to start off by saying that &quot;YES, this anime does contain mild sex scenes and incestuous themes&quot;, but if you&#039;re comfortable enough with your own insecurities and own ideals, you should still find this to be an enjoyable anime. After all, this is not the first nor the last anime that will contain such said themes. As a person with a little sister, I do get uncomfortable with themes like incest because I love my sister, but I&#039;m not physically attracted to her at all. Anyway, now that I&#039;ve got THAT out of the way, I&#039;ll keep this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179104">
        review short and simple. <br />
<br />
Story (8/10)<br />
<br />
      The main story is told through the perspective of Haruka Kasugano, a male high school student whose parents have deceased. Now all alone with his twin sister, he deals with a series of different relationships with different girls. Honestly, not the most insanely interesting story, but pretty good and engaging. The story is told at a rather fast pace for a romance/drama and I think that really helps keep the audience engaged. The ending was rather satisfying, but it was also rather predictable and almost borderline boring. I kind of wanted more drama towards the end and not the bittersweet ending the anime presented itself with. <br />
<br />
Art (8/10)<br />
<br />
    Not really much to say here. The art was extremely beautiful. Each character had unique facial features and no one character looked alike for the most part. However, there wasn&#039;t anything special enough for me to say this was &quot;Jaw-dropping&quot; or anything like that. Pretty nice art nonetheless. <br />
<br />
Sound (8/10)<br />
<br />
   Pretty nice music throughout the whole anime. Nothing totally special, but good enough for me to notice. Opening and closing songs were ok and maybe worth downloading. Decent music for Romance/Drama though. Definitely helped hype up emotion in many of the scenes throughout the entire series. As far as voice acting goes, pretty good, but keep in mind I don&#039;t speak Japanese so I can&#039;t say it&#039;s perfect for sure. There were never any awkward out of sync problems or glitches either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character (7/10)<br />
<br />
     Maybe It&#039;s just me, but judging characters in harem anime is typically hard because you can&#039;t focus on one character for too long or be completely satisfied with the amount of screen time your favorite character gets. However, this anime does a good job of splitting up screen time and character development evenly. Unfortunately, that also means it&#039;s hard to get attached to a single character. I also found some characters annoying and a bit extraneous. For example, the class rep and other male lead felt like they didn&#039;t need to be there. The male protagonist was also a bit boring and stereotypical. On the other hand, his twin sister was a pretty interesting character, but just didn&#039;t have enough screen time to develop properly. Decent characters in general. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (7/10)<br />
<br />
     This is all based on my own personal taste so don&#039;t hate me if I enjoyed this anime more or less than you. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a bad anime, but it is sort of boring at times. I&#039;ve been on a Romance/Drama/Comedy anime roll lately so I might be judging this anime harshly. I did enjoy it overall, but it&#039;s definitely not anime I&#039;d go crazy over. Is it worth watching? Yeah, sure. It&#039;s pretty short and has a pretty fast pace so it&#039;s pretty easy to get into it. I think I would&#039;ve enjoyed it more if the some characters weren&#039;t so bland and stereotypical. <br />
<br />
Overall (7/10)<br />
<br />
   Good, but not great. Worth investing time into, but not anything to rush for. I would put this anime just a little above average. I had a decent time watching and hope to find more like it.

    This review is based on the first three episodes of Yosuga no Sora. I repeat: Everything in this review is based off the first three episodes of the anime! My opinion may change, either a minor change or a drastic/significant change. <br />
<br />
Story 8/10  - The story certainly is intriguing and unique to the anime. Unlike major, well-loved animes, the plot of this anime doesn&#039;t really make you think &quot;This anime is awesome! I gotta watch the next episode!&quot; It&#039;s more of the feeling of, &quot;Why are the characters doing that? Maybe the answer will be in the next episode.&quot;. The main difference, I feel,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31467">
        is that they intentionally leave out some important details in a matter that we become interested so that we try to figure it out (the only way is to continue on). Now, I think that in some areas of the anime, things become slightly rushed, and sometimes things are too slow, so it doesn&#039;t have good consistency with plot development.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10 - I especially like the artwork in this anime. The details are made clear, the animation is smooth, and the characters are &quot;KAWAII!&quot;. Anywho, this is not an anime for loli fans. The characters are more refined, and it gives some mixed feelings, whereas the story has a mix of seriousness and... uh... care-free-ness (is that even a word?) while the art makes it look like it&#039;s an anime fit for adults (technically, it&#039;s rated R+ for mild nudity, so even though I doubt this&#039;ll make a difference, KIDS, STAY AWAY FROM IT).<br />
<br />
Sound 8/0 - The soundtracks match the scenery and situations very nicely, although I feel that during some significant parts of this anime, they should change the soundtrack. An emotional scene being backed up by a &quot;cheery&quot; soundtrack sometimes doesn&#039;t fit in.<br />
<br />
Character 8/10 - This is part of the flaw of the storyline. The characters aren&#039;t the average generic anime characters. They all have their own unique personality, and you get to like them. The main problem, though, is the character development. It&#039;s the main part that is too slow in development. At the end of the first two episodes, I felt as though I still had no clue about the characters, though I knew the directly announced details. <br />
<br />
Overall 9/10 - So far, I like this anime. Though it could use some improvements, it takes a different approach at catching the audience, the art is VERY nice (comparable with anime movies), and it stands out from most copy-and-paste-stories-from-other-animes-and-otherstuff animes.

    Incest without guilt would be like sausages without mustard. If you like incest romance, it’s definitely worth watching.<br />
<br />
I watched the show then read the visual novel so I’ll include some comparison in here for those who are interested.<br />
<br />
Premise:<br />
Boy and girl twins, Haruka and Sora; their parents died. They move into their gandpa’s house in the countryside(granpa is dead). They used to visit Granpa a lot. Lots of girls in this town like Haruka because he is pretty. Omnibus romance ensues. Haruka and Sora try to keep a tight lid on what’s going on between them, but the opening kinda gives it away.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Akira is an energetic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181053">
        and really nice and sociable shrine maiden with family issues, which she is an orphan so… In the visual novel she’s a much bigger presence to be honest. No matter which route you take, she strongly empathizes with all the characters and tries to help them no matter what they’re going through. Here, she&#039;s... energetic and nice and has family issues. She also has giant boobs in this. Boobs generally are a lot bigger in the anime.<br />
<br />
Kazuha is rich and pretty. And she plays the violin. I guess she’s nice.<br />
<br />
Nao, I think, actually calls herself Haruka’s big sister from time to time. She’s really just his childhood friend. She’s supportive and relatively mature.  And when her arc comes around, I admire her. She has a boyfriend who is deeply obsessed with his twin sister, and Nao is just like, “Well, I knew what I was getting myself into.” It’s not that she’s doesn’t have a problem with it, but she’s known Haru and Sora for so long she’s on their side no matter what. Though Sora utterly hates her guts.<br />
<br />
Haruka, in the anime, is a fairly normal pretty boy aside from his relationship with his twin sister. The visual novel focused a lot more on Haru simply trying to learn to live on his own with Sora, sort out their household, and integrate both himself and Sora into this town. The anime focuses a lot more on the romances which leaves Haru with not much character development and not much to do aside from tending on his girlfriend of the week. I think Sora’s arc works much better because dealing with her brings out a lot more of Haru&#039;s past. Also, how a man deals with his incestuous desires is really a test of character. <br />
<br />
Knowing Haru as I do from the VN, he’s really just as messed up by his parents&#039; deaths as Sora is, but he feels like he needs to keep it together for Sora’s sake. In the anime they make it seem as if he enjoys Sora’s relying in him, but in the VN we see that after the funeral, Sora kinda freaked out and put everything on his shoulders. He didn’t have much of a choice, and he’s really not sure what he’s doing trying to run a household.  Deep down, he wants someone else to make these decisions or at least show him what to do and he resents Sora always putting everything on him while she tales it easy. Well, we don’t get too much of that in the anime, but we do get to see him nearly lose his mind and cry big hot man-tears over Sora, which is about as good.<br />
<br />
Sora is quiet, reclusive, haughty, and dismissive. The only person she ever listens to even sometimes is her brother Haru. She spent half her life in a hospital and Haru was the only person who visited her on a regular basis. She’s developed a strong attachment to Haru , though she normally never leaves her room. She’s gotten very used to sitting alone in her bed and surfing the internet. I lover her line when Haru tells her he’s not sure they can get internet and she says, “I cannot live without it.” <br />
<br />
For me, Sora is the one who makes this anime. I even like her better here than in the visual novel. The little scenes where she mocks the other girls behind their backs, the little fantasies of hers we see every so often; it adds something to her character that really wasn’t in the visual novel. Honestly, in the VN I couldn’t tell if she was really in love with Haru or just insanely jealous of Nao. She actually comes off a little more mature and, well, sane in this version. Her voice, here, is also a slightly lower register and doesn’t sound so ridiculously cutesy. That helps.<br />
<br />
Conclusion/Opinion:<br />
Honestly, I enjoy this anime a lot more than I should. I do so by ignoring episodes 4-9 and focusing on the relationship between Haru and Sora. Other people seem to think the Kazuha, Akira, and Nao romances are worthwhile, and you might like them. Plotwise, however, they are pretty thin. The show tries to involve us by giving the girls back stories,  but the conflict involved is a pale shadow compared to what’s going on between Haru and Sora in the first episode. This was not a good candidate for the omnibus romance structure.<br />
<br />
As I said before, Haru is mostly characterized in the VN by his attempts to manage his household and deal with Sora. The anime doesn’t have time for household details because they need to make room for four different romance stories, and his romantic interests don’t really tell us much about Haru. This makes it hard to care about Haru’s relationships since we don’t really know much about him. <br />
<br />
I think they would have done better to give this a merged structure like the Kanon and Clannad animes. We could even have kept some of the sex scenes too. All we’d have to do is say Haru is one pretty son of a gun and he needs to distract himself from his sister by involving himself in the problems of all these other girls. I mean that’s basically what they did with Nao in the final arc anyway.<br />
<br />
What I really like here are the parts dealing with Haru and Sora’s relationship. I love this one scene in the first episode where Haru and Sora are sitting across the table from eachother and we see an imaginary scene of Haru walking over an kissing his sister. But who imagined it? I’ve seen people argue it both ways and honestly, I don’t see why both of them shouldn’t be imagining it. Its definitely on both their minds. <br />
<br />
I love the tension which arises from seeing that Haru and Sora are clearly obsessed with eachother from the beginning but that they keep a very tight lid on it. I remember when this first came out, someone stated just how smart it was to make it clear from the beginning that there would be sex in this anime.  This allows the first episode to clearly pose the question, “Are these two going to have sex?” without there necessarily being a clear answer. Though the Omnibus romance structure kinda promises Haru’s gonna have sex with everybody at some point, I think it was a smart move to put the Sora arc at the end to give time for the tension to rise. It would have been even smarter if the structure were merged but oh well.<br />
<br />
I particularly love Haru’s decent into insanity. I’ve gone insane before and, yeah, this is pretty much what it’s like. Zegapain kinda has a similar thing but it’s a little more drawn out here. And I should let you know, this part isn’t in the VN, it just wouldn’t work. In the VN, Haru goes crazy in other ways, becoming as detached with reality as Sora is. But here, we get to see Haru’s face as he cries big man-tears, and we get to see him try to make his relationship with  Nao work out. We get to see him desperately reach out for help and get rejected. That’s some powerful cinema.<br />
<br />
Other nice bits include seeing Haru and Sora constantly texting eachother on their smart phones.  That was a lot of fun to see in action. The scenery, which is based on an actual small town in the Japanese countryside, is also very different from the VN. Its not really better or worse. I like the character designs better in the VN, where the art in general has a much softer feel and uses less vivid colors so that everything looks a little faded. But the vivid colors of the anime work much better for the environment. <br />
<br />
I also love how Kozue gets a name in this. In the VN even her dialogue box is labeled “Class Prez”. She’s not really any more important here but I like how she freaks out and gets all judgmental at the end. Everyone is way too okay with all this in the VN, but Kozue in the anime knows how to lay on the guilt and social rejection like a boss. I used to hate her in this anime. Reading the VN made me realize just how much she adds to the story. Incest without guilt really is like sausages without mustard.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I love how Haru is voicedby the same guy who did Katsuragi Keima in TWGOK and Kamina Ayato in RahXephon. Shimono Hiro is just awesome at screaming like a madman. Plus now I can imagine this show is really about Kami-niisama playing through the VN.<br />
<br />
I rate this as a 7 because fully half of the show is not worth rewatching. The art isn’t too remarkable and the music while appropriate can get a little cliché. The plot isn’t exactly Count of Monte Cristo genius, but is succeeds in raising the tension and bringing out some of the characters. I thoroughly however enjoy rewatching the final arc and the first few episodes. I recommend it to anyone who can put up with incest and the omnibus structure.<br />

    What can I say about Yosuga no Sora without wanting to bash my head on my keyboard with rage? <br />
Well it was a Japanese visual novel, starring the male lead, Haruka, three girls from his childhood and his sister. I think you know where this is going...<br />
<br />
Story: The story starts out with Haruka and his little sister, Sora as they go back to their childhood village due to their parent&#039;s deaths. Along the way they meet with three girls, Nao, Akira, and Kazuha, all of whom know Haruka from childhood. Throughout the series it shows how Haruka and Sora settle into the village and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review80318">
        four girl&#039;s lust for Haruka, since he is, of course, the main character.<br />
As you can see, the story is typical harem fodder, but this show likes to take it the extra mile by having only one other male character and he gets virtually no screen time. Also, get used to hearing how much they make Haruka look like he&#039;s the King of the Womanizers, his SWAG puts Yu Narukami to shame.<br />
<br />
Sound: The sound&#039;s pretty good, and by sound I mean the same freaking song being played every 5 seconds and the terrible OP. Other than that, it has pretty decent voice work.<br />
<br />
Character: Haruka = emotionless bland lead, Sora = Loli - tsundere with a brother complex, Nao = Booby lady (Sorry Litchi!), Akira = Bubbly girl with dark past and Kazuha = Rich girl who hates her rich parents due to rich reasons. Also Ryouhei = BROSEPH, and Kozue = Just There.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: If I&#039;m being perfectly honest, I only get enjoyment when I see the end credits. EVERYONE in this show is stupid and the fact that some people actually think this show is credible astounds me.<br />
<br />
People, don&#039;t waste your time with this, you&#039;ll only stay for the sex. Go watch something like Kobato. or Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure instead, at least they weren&#039;t pure softcore hentai.<br />

          At first sight, many people might turn away in disgust when finding out the anime includes incest and softcore, while disregarding all other aspects of the story. However Yosuga no Sora is a genuinely enticing drama that, when looked at with an unbiased and thoughtful perspective, displays a heartwarming drama (One of the best in my opinion, challenging Clannad).<br />
<br />
     The story separates into four arcs, where Haruka, the main character, courts one for each main female character: Episode 1,2,3,4 for Migiwa; Episodes 1,2,5,6 for Akira; Episodes 1,2,7,8,9 for Nao; and the main storyline 1,2,7,10,11,12 for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review41769">
        Sora. This is not just some typical harem where the main character is just simply infatuated by each girl in their respective arc. There is a deep, thorough and complex story and personality behind each character, and it makes the characters feel realistic. The only flaw I see in the series is its short length. Not enough time is given for each arc to progress. Though it doesn&#039;t feel rushed, more details could be put between each arc to enchance the story. 9/10<br />
<br />
     I have to admit, this series have perhaps one of the best artwork and music I have ever seen in an anime. The characters are all designed beautifully, and the animation was smooth. This will really please any modern viewers like me. 10/10. Now the music is also beautiful. The BGM really brings out the emotion in each episodes and sets the mood perfectly. If you don&#039;t believe me, just watch the first episode. 10/10<br />
<br />
     The anime is filled with suspense and drama, so brace yourselves. Now the controversial parts. As the story progressives to the end of each arc, there is generally one or possibly more softcore sex scene. HOWEVER, this was not forced and has the motive of moving the story forward. It gives more to the plot rather than a cheap sex scene. People will also question the incest (twincest) in the story. I garuntee you potential viewers, watch the anime to the end, consider the character&#039;s feelings, WHY would they want to be together, and think about if you are to take the character&#039;s places, how much would you give to love. Morality is overall governed by yourself. <br />
<br />
Consider these points and dive in for an epitome of romance anime. <br />

    It is the atmosphere of this show that I love from the bottom of my heart. And that could not have been done without the minor hentai.<br />
<br />
All anime need to have its audience keep watching the show. For some anime, it&#039;s the story. For others, &#039;ecchi.&#039;  For this show, it was probably the minor hentai. Because this anime already had an aspect to keep its viewers glued to the screen, it didn&#039;t have to rely on some obvious and stupid fanservice, nor did it have to try to put in a plot twist just to keep it interesting.<br />
<br />
Because the life of a hentai is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201090">
        its art, the art of the whole show was great. The sound was also splendid, and I&#039;m sure anyone who&#039;s watched this show would at least agree on that point. These two plus the countryside setting make the atmosphere of this show one of the best in the anime genre, ever.<br />
<br />
So, for new viewers and those who dropped this show, I want you to see this show not for its story, but for its atmosphere. The characters, art, sound, and setting would grab your heart in the first minutes of the first episode.<br />
<br />
But in the end, the anime is a minor hentai. It wouldn&#039;t grab everyone&#039;s heart. There is incest, a bit of yuri, and some obvious sex scenes. But for me, the anime just felt so nostalgic that I didn&#039;t really mind them. So go on, watch this show. Don&#039;t drop it before watching it just because it&#039;s a hentai. There&#039;s a reason it&#039;s so popular.
