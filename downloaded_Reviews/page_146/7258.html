    Ah, yes, nice to see my Twitter feed finally getting an anime adaptation. <br />
<br />
Yes, just yes. Whatever this show is on I need at least 10 times the lethal dosage injected directly into my capillaries. There’s no pretense with Azu-Lane, absolutely none at all, and it’s hard to not love for that reason alone. For the uninitiated, Azur Lane is the gacha equivalent of crack cocaine, essentially making up half of China’s GDP. An eventual adaptation of this popular gacha game seemed imminent from the moment it was released, it was only a matter of time. For all intents, Azu-Lane’s model is admittedly exploitative and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320541">
        shallow, but I’ll be damned if its not a model that doesn’t work. Because what could be more wholesome than watching cute anime girls turn into various naval vessels and fight for supremacy? <br />
<br />
Nobody’s saying Azu-Lane is some highfalutin work of genius. However, with its sheer volume of cute anime girls that basically run the gamut for whatever designs any of you horny weebs might find appealing, indulgent action, and cockamamie plot, it’s not hard to see why it blew up in the first place. This is a gold standard of camp, and I think it threw in just the right amount of garbage to make this a palatable guilty pleasure. <br />
<br />
If you’re familiar with the gacha formula, it would be a no-brainer that this thing would necessitate bloating its world with needless amounts of characters. None of them are particularly interesting (half of them are AraAra queens), but it’s hard to really knock that because they are memorably designed enough and have enough personality to stick with you even if it’s on a shallow level. Everyone’s got their “ship” that they’re willing to sink for, this show’s cast is like a hydra, introduce one cute anime girl and before you know it 5 more are brought in with her. <br />
<br />
The fights are cool in concept but having a huge cast of characters lends to some chaotic action-sequences. The CG is often slipshod. The models themselves are fine but like most anime that utilize CG models, the movement is noticeably stilted. Often times the CG models move so fast that it sufficiently masks the fact that they look somewhat jarring. Still, I will often find myself in awe at some of these set-pieces and combat concepts. “Did she just shoot a fucking plane out of that bow?!” -Drunk me, 3AM, some bathroom stall in Tampa. The audacity of this show. There is no sense of restraint with the action. Explosions and pyrotechnics drip off of almost every frame of any given action sequence you can pull from this thing. It’s a cream dream of over-the-top visual splendor seeing these girls try to nonchalantly blow each other up while zooming around the screen with various weapons and augmentations attached to them like they’re friggin Transformers. <br />
<br />
Whenever Azu-Lane isn’t laser-focused on its excessive action sequences or typical but charming slice of life antics, it can get a little monotonous watching these girls regurgitate exposition you don’t care about. Luckily, whenever characters do little more than sit around and exposit their mouths off, it’s mostly only for the sake of transitioning from one scene to another. The story is little more than window dressing for its concept. There’s a shallow anti-war message and propaganda about the “faceless enemy” buried under the mountains of excess, I’m sure, but Azu-Lane never takes itself so seriously that it really has any bearing on its overall presentation. <br />
<br />
Is Azur Lane an ironic yet acerbic commentary on our blatant fetishizing of anime as a medium? Or perhaps its a clever allegory for Japan’s checkered past with World War 2 and the way it has shaped the country’s contemporary culture? Whatever the case may be, this show is as stupidly addicting as its source game. There’s no veil that needs to be pulled back with this one. Azu-Lane fans are going to eat this up, people who are unfamiliar or aren’t steeped in the gacha craze might not enjoy the flagrant pandering/fanservice...or you know...just like...learn to have fun every once in a while? Azu-Lane is “cute girls doing stupid things” pastiche cranked up to its max. If shows like Girls und Panzer, Strike Witches, or the obvious Kantai Collection are your thing, Azur Lane just might be your new favorite anime. This show is perfectly stupid fun, and that’s all I could’ve asked for from this one. <br />

    Alright, I&#039;ll get straight to the point: when you think about this Anime as the story/background/plot (whatever) of the videogame it&#039;s not terrible, but when you think about it as a show and a show only you&#039;ll see this is as mediocre as it gets.<br />
<br />
My review will contain strong language, and I declare already that I  do not intend to offend anyone by what I&#039;ll say, it&#039;s just my opinion and me using simple language and vocabulary to express my feelings towards this anime. <br />
<br />
Ok! Let&#039;s start from the beginning, I played azur lane a while ago maybe a year and a half or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320604">
        something and I played it for about two weeks. When I began watching this I pretty much didn&#039;t remember anything from the game but a few characters here and there.<br />
<br />
So in the first episode(s) you just get information shoved on your face. And by this I mean you get introduced to a shit ton of characters and a lot of specific words and faction names whatsoever IN JUST ONE EPISODE. The next episodes I don&#039;t really want to talk about them because I feel like I lost braincells already. The concept is so shitty, the plot goes nowhere and I just keep wondering to myself if this was just a thing to satisfy the mobile gaming weebs and give them an anime of their cute little ships and stuff...<br />
<br />
The animation is below average although not terrible, soundtrack is ok I guess, i don&#039;t know about the characters because for me each one just brings a new type of fanservice along and the plot as I mentioned before goes nowhere.<br />
<br />
To summarize, you literally get nothing out of this show. No matter what you say most of what I said are facts. If you played the game well here&#039;s more fanservice for you! Go ahead!

    As someone who loves Azur Lane, I&#039;ll be honest: This adaptation was terrible. <br />
<br />
- Mediocre story featuring a generic plot, awful pacing, an OOC lead (Enterprise), forced yuribait, and an inconsistent setting. If the writers&#039; goal was to sum up the in-game story so far, they failed spectacularly. No in-game events are mentioned or animated, and what context is presented is vague and never expanded upon. Enterprise is reduced to a one-note ration addict without common sense who can only be saved not by her sister (Hornet) or her dedicated repair ship (Vestal), but by Belfast because yuribait. One of the major factions in-game (Ironblood)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332139">
        is sidelined with their starter ship only getting ~3 minutes of screentime, and the minor factions are nowhere to be found. Episodes sporadically hop from serious moments to lighthearted ones as if the writers couldn&#039;t agree on the atmosphere they wanted to present. There are several more issues I can give (e.g. that one episode where it took ~12 minutes of ships slowly approaching each other before they actually started fighting, Akagi being stuck with the idiot ball for several episodes) but you get the idea.<br />
<br />
- Inconsistent animation; compare the first and second halves of Episode 8 and you&#039;ll see what I mean. There&#039;s a reason Bibury had to delay the last two episodes by three months just to make them serviceable. Speaking of which...<br />
<br />
- Terrible &#039;fight scenes&#039; with no sense of choreography or intensity. Zooming around on planes and dodging bombs is not a fight scene, it&#039;s a snooze fest. Some fights were better than others (Enterprise vs Zuikaku), but for the most part they were laughable.<br />
<br />
- Forgettable soundtrack outside of the OP/ED outside of one or two tracks.<br />
<br />
- Dub was hilariously bad; the German accents were way too thick.<br />
<br />
Now this adaptation wasn&#039;t garbage at everything, and it&#039;s true that viewers had low expectations going in since since Bibury is a freelance studio that normally does in-between animation instead of entire adaptations. However, the only redeemable things about this adaptation (e.g. most character portrayals including voice acting) are done just as well if not better by the game, the manga adaptations of the game, and even Azur Lane Crosswave (regardless of its controversial gameplay). It&#039;s disappointing, and I feel bad for both Manjuu and Yostar because they&#039;ve put their heart and soul into the IP for years, but now they have to deal with the bad reputation of an adaptation that was clearly doomed from Day 1.<br />
<br />
If you have not played Azur Lane, please give it a shot. I can guarantee you that the game is much better than this adaptation on all fronts, and that Manjuu &amp; Yostar treat it with plenty of love and care. As for this adaptation...well, at least the Blu-rays remedy some of the animation errors. <br />
<br />
March 2021 Edit: Yostar Pictures&#039;s adaptation of Azur Lane (Bisoku Zenshin) just finished airing and is far better than this adaptation was, so be sure to give it a look if you were hoping for something else. I&#039;ve also edited this review for concision.

    Perhaps the theme of ship girls isn’t an overly saturated idea in the anime medium. We’ve only had a handful of anime about ship girls in these recent years. Azur Lane does gleefully feel similar to Kantai Collection, a franchise that it drew influences from. Back in 2015, Kantai Collection presented itself as a love letter to fans of the game. Azur Lane follows a similar path and by that, it tries to please the fans.<br />
<br />
But as an anime original viewer, Azur Lane presented itself to me as a fan disservice of naval storytelling. The plot deals with nations fighting against the mysterious alien force

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332106">
        known as the “Sirens”. Azur Lane is a military alliance established to counter the threat that consist of the Eagle Union, Sakura Empire, Royal Navy, and Ironblood. However, these nations develop ideal clashes that breeds internal problems within the alliance. Let me tell you this right now and that is, you should not expect much character development for the oversaturated cast of characters. Besides a few of the more prominent characters such as Enterprise, Akagi, Unicorn, Javelin, Belfast, and Kaga, there’s far too many to count or worth investing time into. It’s a flaw of the anime with viewers being easily lost within its sea of characters and even the plot. Azur Lane seems to be the type of anime that’s aimed for an audience already familiar with the franchise.<br />
<br />
That being said, the anime isn’t completely unwatchable. Naval warfare takes shape with a war drama story that isn’t difficult to understand. The main question is how much you feel attached to the story it tells us. The main plot deals with how each nation operates by using its arsenal and military units in the conflict against the Sirens. When it doesn’t engage in war, we do have the so called “breather episodes” to give the characters time to relax. The first half of the series even had a particular beach episode to give time off for the ship girls. Other times, it brings together characters from different nations and their ideals. One of the most prominent character is Enterprise, an ace renowned for her skills and her experience. Throughout the anime, she faces her own personal demons including dealing with the incident of her sister, Yorktown. While the anime doesn’t pull the trigger on most of the cast, Yorktown does become a victim of warfare and in respect, Enterprise feels responsible. In a sensible topic, war can be a life altering experience. Azur Lane seeks to promote character assassination on occasions despite the highly fictional content.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned before, Azur Lane seems like type of anime targeted to fans who are already familiar with the franchise. There’s far too many cast and as result, many of the characters gets demoted to background extras or even omitted. A primary example is the limited focus on Ironblood and its members. The anime attempts to remedy this by having groups of characters appearing but it doesn’t really leave a good taste. On the other hand, it’s easy to see that some character relationships to be intimate than others. No, this is not a shoujo-ai. But sometimes, you do get a ship tease between characters such as Akagi and Kaga. Unfortunately, the relationships in this anime is eye catchy at best but filled with utter nonsense. Watching Azur Lane made me feel like a kid who got a flashy new toy but gets bored the very next day. Characters such as Unicorn serves as mascots that brings little value to the storytelling. If you’re seeking for a concrete plot, seriously look elsewhere. This isn’t an anime that will make you quote lines from what it’s selling.<br />
<br />
On the technical elements, Azur Lane became a victim of for its visual quality and animation. There&#039;s obvious problems with the production values when the producers decided to delay the series&#039; final two episodes by 3 months. While character designs doesn&#039;t suffer from CGI, some of them looks inconsistent in background scenes. Most of the time, the characters looks scripted on set and the battle chereography seems like it&#039;s a live slideshow. There&#039;s no easy way to say it but Azur Lane takes a big fall on its animation front.<br />
<br />
Ah, Azur Lane. Somehow, I got the impression the producers wanted to throw all this together to get the audience&#039;s favor into the game. Honestly, the plot is so poorly written that you may have to look up a wiki to understand the full gest. Without playing the game, this show won’t be much of an enjoyable experience. It&#039;s not even an eye pleaser with the atrocious animation. You will certainly not come out of this show remembering a memorable quote or two. And it’s a shame really. It&#039;s 2020 and we haven’t received a decent anime about ship girls in ages.

    I&#039;m gonna be honest, I honestly didn&#039;t expect this adaptation to do the game any justice. But to my surprise I found this quite a bit more enjoyable than the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story 8/10:<br />
The story is basically the same as it is in the game, an alien group called the Siren appear in the sea out of nowhere so to combat this new threat the navy fanservice the shit out of military grade ships in order to make a new fetish (and maybe save the ocean while there at it.) Along the way the four groups who developed these sea waifus separate into two factions, Ironblood and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320590">
        Sakura Empire vs Eagle Union and Royal Navy, who fight over stupid stuff like morals, ethics and the fate of the world. Great story in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10:<br />
I&#039;ve gotta say I am really impressed by the art and animation in this show. All the characters look amazing, their movements are spot on and their attitudes seem identical to what it was in the game. The background art doesn&#039;t get any worse, it looks incredible and whole show is lit up with bright colours which does really well to reflect how the show feels.<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10:<br />
I&#039;m not a huge fan of the music in the show but the sound effects were really good. Nothing else much to say.<br />
<br />
Characters 10/10:<br />
I honestly think the place this anime shines the most at is with the characters. All the characters have amazing designs with every one of them looking great. The studio has done an incredible job making even backgrounds characters look unique by using actual characters from the game. On top of that all the characters have unique personalities including even the background characters which is quite rare in anime. In addition almost every character archetype and troupe is represented through a character meaning that there is a potential waifu for literally everyone.<br />
<br />
Overall 9/10:<br />
Solid anime. Can&#039;t wait for more episodes.

    AHHH...Azur Lane, how we missed ya then and back, and now out again. The promise that we&#039;d have a decent game adaptation with an original storyline that subsequently went to shit as it progresses, not to mention the many warship waifus and the mediocre animation that accompanies this dreaded show.<br />
<br />
Based on the gacha game of the same name (that was insanely popular at the time), Azur Lane features anthropomorphic World War 2 waifu ships that we have the joy of the love-hate relationships between its insanely big cast of allies and enemies to develop their growth overtime as we please and experience some of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332108">
        very best mobile games have to offer. And of course, the anime adaptation was a sure-fire thing back when it got massively popular back in 2017. But what we got instead was a production so haphazard, it&#039;s like the production staff at Bibury Animation Studios knew what they were doing under the tutelage of the studio&#039;s owner and director Tensho (Grisaia, Rewrite series) and on Jin Haganeya (Guilty Crown, Demonbane) being series composer (at the recommendation of publisher Shanghai Yostar&#039;s president Li Hengda, with Demonbane being one of his favourite shows), even all of that went to naught with this show.<br />
<br />
Starting with the story, it&#039;s your standard run-of-the-mill &quot;heroes vs. villains&quot; cliche archetype with the impending &quot;ideals vs. realism&quot;-sake type of story with the central huge cast of characters. Of course, they&#039;re already known by which group they belong to (if you played the mobile game). This setting isn&#039;t bad, but it&#039;s one that has been done a thousand times over and over again to the point of boredom. If you&#039;d refer back to my earlier &quot;name-notables&quot; with Jin Haganeya, he&#039;s a pretty mediocre writer, with Guilty Crown being the easiest victim to blame for (since  Despite the recommendation for him to be writing the storyboard for this show, I found it to be pretty much nonsensical, or at worse times non-existent even with a decent storyline, other than the waifu ships which have garnered lots of love the way before the anime started, and those same feelings are endorsed here.<br />
<br />
Character-wise, what&#039;s there not to love about the character cast? From Azur Lane&#039;s seasoned leader &quot;Grey Ghost&quot; Enterprise with her assistant Belfast, Eagle Union&#039;s loli warships Javelin, Laffey and Unicorn to former comrade-turned-spy Red Axis&#039;s Ayanami and Sakura Empire&#039;s Akagi, they&#039;re pretty much the standard bogfare and the core foundation of the series to date, and I am happy to say that they absolutely have no faults (well, except how they&#039;re utilized in the story).<br />
<br />
The elephant in the room has got to be Tensho&#039;s Bibury Animation Studios, who came out of the deal with doing second-rate in-between animation, and then split out to produce the Grisaia: Phantom Trigger movie to decent results. And now, with this show being it&#039;s very first TV series, the same feelings that can be said on the Grisaia movie sadly shares the same with Azur Lane here. Don&#039;t get me wrong, the visuals are all done nicely...for the first few episodes. And then they just seemingly went with the flow of sacrificing quality for quantity when it comes to the bombastic action scenes (that are supposed to be as good as the game itself, mind you) of which Azur Lane (the game) is no stranger to such good animation and lets the gamers feel fulfilled (after tanking hours of gameplay). Even the CGI scenes which were meant to be flashy, ended up as wack and we&#039;re all left wondering if that was actually incorporated at the very last minute or the lack of skill to make even such scenes stand out. Needless to say, all of that didn&#039;t translate well to the anime despite the popularity over in Japan when it was first launched there to successful results.<br />
<br />
Another wacky area is always with the music. Other than a forgetful OP (of which May&#039;n is producing decent to mediocre songs nowadays) and the nice ED by Kano, I honestly don&#039;t remember any good tunes, even after the 3-months gap due to production issues. Other than that, it&#039;s only the fanservice that gets us feeling good that is the best part of this show.<br />
<br />
When all is said and done, what happened with Azur Lane: The Animation, it&#039;s all the same as selling merchandise: this show is meant to be a cash-cow adding onto the popularity of the series in its many mediums. The same with the subgenre with shows like Girls und Panzer, Kantai Collection, they have their own niches and I can&#039;t complain about that. Stick with the games and forbade on the anime, your experience will vary on the better side than to side with the show, which is a +1 to the many mediocre game adaptations of recent years. This show HAD the potential to be good (and us the audience are honestly in for it), and it was horrendously wasted to trash.

    Azur Lane is weird, not because of what Azur Lane is about (heck, you couldn’t be more anime if you tried), but for what it is. An adaptation of a popular mobile game that has good production values. Normally, stuff like this are usually cash grabs to capitalize on how popular the mobile game is. But it felt like Bibury Animation studios wanted to create a fun spectacle. So far at least, that has been the case. There is a sense of enjoyment in this show with cute but badass girls using Battleships as weapons fighting each other while skimming across the sea in what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320561">
        is essentially America and Britain vs Germany and Japan. <br />
<br />
That being said, the show does have flaws to it that may hold the show back by the end. Starting off, the characters. Now my problem is not the characters themselves as some of them I do like. My problem is that there is SO MANY OF THEM. When you are trying to adapt a game with so many characters, then it can get overwhelming and you just struggle to remember the names unless you are already invested into the game. It is a trap that similar adaptations would fall into and this is no exception. I get it, you don’t want to leave characters out, but you are just unleashing a wave of them all at once to the viewer so it can get overwhelming and it affects character development and investment, even the ones the show is really trying to focus on when it has to share screentime with every other character. <br />
<br />
The story isn’t exactly anything of note but it does do its job. Beings known as Sirens invaded Earth and took control of the seas. In response, a group called Azur Lane created anthropomorphic ships to fight back. They succeed and now they are at war with each other as the four major camps split into two sides. Not America (Eagle Union) and not Britain (Royal Navy) fight together as not Germany (Iron Blood) and not Japan (Sakura Empire) start using Siren technology. So war begins. A simple story that gets the job done of setting the scene for some battles between the two sides. Nothing particularly wrong with that. But it also rather bare bones as it is simply good vs evil with a tiny bit of grey area to it that feels somewhat predictable from a mile away. <br />
<br />
But I have to give credit where credit is due because the animation and sound is just great. The show looks and sounds goods to give the fight scenes some extra flair to it. It’s fun to watch seeing these girls battle it out in interesting and creative ways. It lets the fighting do the talking when it comes to telling a narrative which I think it does well. The show is clearly trying to anchor itself as being a fun watch and let the fight scenes do the talking, which is perfectly fine if you want to get people to enjoy the action. That being said, I noticed some of the characters looked off from a long distance as some body parts looked disproportionate to each other. I didn’t see it a lot of the time but I did catch my eye on some scenes that were the case. <br />
<br />
Now, my main worry with show moving forward though is that how long can this show hold up with that mindset of letting the fight scenes do the talking. To abbreviate a quote from my review on Sirius, “High quality animation and sound can only carry you so far before its story and characters have to help carry the show.” I worry that Azur lane will fall under this as the show goes on as the story and characters will need to hold up its own weight. It does seem like that is the case though as the narratives between our main leads Enterprise, Javelin and Laffey are interesting to say the least and could lead to some interesting moments. But it might struggle later on as the large cast will need to get their own share of screentime, even some that are more significant than others. As for now, I am enjoying watching this series from a spectacle standpoint as the animation and sounds make the show enjoyable to watch but the large cast of characters and rather simple story leaves me worrying that this show could simply be a show that burns out too quickly before reaching its final episode. <br />
<br />
First Impression:<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
Bare bones but does its job at setting the scene. <br />
Characters: 5/10 <br />
An overwhelming amount of characters that lack development and investment affects the score but some of them are interesting enough to be intrigued. <br />
Animation: 8.5/10<br />
Looks good and animates well to make the action enjoyable. <br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Good soundtrack and soundbytes add to the scenes well with an enjoyable opening to boot. <br />
My Personal Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
I am enjoying watching this show as pure, action entertainment but I worry about the story and characters and if it gets worse from here. <br />
<br />
Overall Score: 6.7/10 Recommendation: Consider it<br />

    You know, I learned one thing about adaptation of video games: they are almost never good. Azur Lane had it even worse being a gacha game for phones, so it could not rely on having a good story that can be comfortably put into 12 episodes. So instead of a plot we are overflowed with fanservice (and I think people watching this anime came for it), wich is not bad on its own, the problem lies more in budget and amount of work invested into the title. And let me tell you - neither is really impressive. Yes, fanservice part is okayish, but it is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332135">
        not really a hard thing to do when you have an already massive amount of reference material of varying lewdness. However, animation showed itself worse in &quot;action&quot; scenes. Correct me if I am wrong, but the beauty of naval warfare comes from the scale: massive ships with giant guns shell at each other making water around them explode with missed shots. But if you turn your ships into cute girls, your weapons get scaled down to the same degree, so instead of epic naval battle you watch a few anime girls with handguns, blades, bows and such staying in the open (it is an ocean, you know, there is no cover there) and shooting at each other with abysmal 2-3 frame animations. Same goes for characters, being a gacha game Azur Lane has way too many characters, and while anime included many of them, none of them had any reall substance, they are just there to show their skimpy clothers. <br />
But you know, the biggest problem in my opinion is that after watching all 12 episodes I don&#039;t have much to say about it. There are good shows that you like and write reviews of how great it is. There are bad ones that you hate with passion. Azur Lane was just &quot;a&quot; show, one that I watched and that I will forget a few minutes after finishing this review. It is not bad, it is not good, it is just way too shallow and empty to be anything but a quick doze of fanservice.

    This ,,adaptation&quot; is a complete and utter joke. An empty shell devoid of any logic and common sense. Instead of them we get: half assed story with cheap references, elementary school tier dialogues, sloppy fight scenes, yuribait and lots of panty shots. I can&#039;t fathom why did they even pretend to have some kind of serious plot it only ruins the pacing. The only thing they did well is fanservice, the only reason I see why so many people still watch this shite. If they had gone full meme mode, comedy style this could&#039;ve been a 10/10. ,,The war never changes...&quot; ye no wonder it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321503">
        never changing, when nobody is dying in it and nobody will die, at least not on the screen.<br />
<br />
Art: They&#039;ve  spend money and time only on a couple of scenes, everything else was drawn in a chinese sweatshop by one guy working over hours, no kidding.<br />
<br />
Music: I actually really like the opening and ending, still the game&#039;s soundtrack is way better I don&#039;t know why they still  haven&#039;t used any tracks from it.<br />
<br />
Characters: Oh, so you&#039;ve come to see your botewife? Too bad, she has been replaced by a completely different character that looks like her or if you&#039;re lucky she&#039;s just a background decoration. I&#039;m asking, WHERE THE HELL IS THE ADMIRAL? Turns out that when he&#039;s not around Akagi (a freaking yandere mind you) likes to molest her sister and Enterprise his right hand who&#039;s usually really cheerful and reliable, goes full edge.<br />
<br />
I bet that the people who gave this disgrace a positive score have never actually played the game. And good for them for avoiding dissapointment, at least we can all agree on one thing... ass and titties are carrying this show.<br />

    Before I start , I want to say that I would try my best in refraining to mention game material in this review so that I would avoid spoilers.<br />
<br />
War never changes.  Be it any era, wars have only done nothing but chaos towards the people participating it. That fact remains until today. People will always want to gain something other people have: territories, resources—anything. Once the dispute reaches between governments, a lack of communication will always ensue with WAR.<br />
<br />
Soon, war moved on from the lands to the seas, and naval warfare became one of the most pivotal battles a side cannot afford to lose

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334824">
        lest their disadvantage. In this series, however, an alien forces known as the &quot;Sirens&quot; with extremely powerful technology suddenly appeared, spreading threat to humanity.<br />
 <br />
To combat this situation, all of mankind miraculously stood in unity against the common foe, creating an organization called &quot;Azur Lane,&quot; which mainly comprised of four countries: Eagle Union, Royal Navy, Sakura Empire, and Iron Blood. The countries used objects named &quot;Mental Cubes&quot; which let them embed the power of full warships upon female soldiers—a breakthrough in technology. This effort of solidarity gave humans an initial victory against the Sirens.<br />
<br />
However, humans will always be humans, and soon, even Azur Lane was broken into two opposing factions. With humanity once again divided alongside the continuing threat of alien enemies, what will be this world&#039;s fate? Such is the story of this series. The premise itself reflects how the world was in the past—even how it is today in times of peace. Conflict is the main essence of man, and the anime did a great job portraying that reality.<br />
<br />
I love how the story became developed as episodes went by. In some instances, I felt that pacing was too fast, but that also refers how life is, especially in wartime, where one must be vigilant at all times because no one knows what will happen in the future. Next day, you might be already dead—killed by the enemy. That is a part of reality this anime portrays, and the execution was quite nice.<br />
<br />
I also like how the art was drawn, especially in scenes where the girls equip their warships and head to the battlefield. Like in the history of war, there were many variations of warships: cruisers, carriers, destroyers, etc. I like how the artists tried their best to draw the actual warship alongside with the character portraying it, for example, you can see Enterprise aboard the runway of the USS Enterprise, and as Enterprise equips her ship, the transformation may be clichéd, but I still like it.<br />
<br />
There were some flaws in the character design, especially on the consistency of body statures—especially a part I&#039;d rather not explain here—but I found it kind of nice and made it a game to spot inconsistencies, but I won&#039;t dwell on it too much. As an Azur Lane gamer, just seeing the girls move around and alive is already a big thing to me, that&#039;s why it has a special place in my favorites.<br />
<br />
The character development in the anime also deserves my praise. I like how the main characters change into people who are lone wolves to team fighters, and that in itself is one of the reasons I love this series. Like I have said before, just seeing the girls adapted into anime makes them more appealing. There was also a good amount of fanservice that are just too good to be missed. The personalities each of the girls had were also preserved in this adaptation, which then was used to create an original story—just splendid.<br />
<br />
The sound is also noteworthy, especially the opening theme with lyrics that reflect with the protagonists&#039; problems and how they should approach it. When it comes to the credit sequence, the music that accompanied it is very relatable—very peaceful—a situation everyone hopes that the world should be. Looking at it technically, the execution of music were greatly in line in the situations the characters were facing, be it a happy scene, or the spoils of war. I also loved how the anime shipgirls were also portrayed by their respective voice actresses from the game. It puts a smile in my face.<br />
<br />
I greatly enjoyed watching this anime. I watched this anime when it was airing, and even though the conclusions of this show was delayed by three months, that only made my excitement go stronger each day that the episodes are nearing to be aired. Once again, I really loved how the anime portrayed its story without straying far from the essence of the game&#039;s original premise. Overall, I&#039;d say that it is one of the most memorable anime I have ever watched. That&#039;s how I loved it.<br />
<br />
Now, I want more especially because of the ending. If there is a second season, I will gladly watch it.<br />
<br />
But would that be possible, especially when there were a lot of production issues? I hope so.

    Oh man. My expectations were high at the time of the first episode, but sunk faster than battleships at Pearl Harbor.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the most painful thing for me: Story.<br />
It&#039;s laughably bad. The story is compromised of two child-like morals: &quot;War is bad&quot; and &quot;Ships are humans too&quot; that the anime keeps dropping every few seconds. <br />
It tries and fails miserably to deliver a serious message, which was an huge mistake in my opinion, since the source material is a silly waifu game. In my opinion the whole anime should have been a fanservice filler. The current iteration is a attempt of serious story, completely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323003">
        void of any common sense.<br />
<br />
The interactions between the characters feels forced beyond belief. The subplot between Ayanami and the other two starters is terrible. Laffey and Javelin met Ayanami for literally 2 seconds, and that apparently justifies her trying to kill your allies. <br />
<br />
Not much else that I can say expect literally everything in this anime is below average. The backgrounds are boring, the sound effects are lame, the animation look cheap and there is a lot of cut corners. <br />
<br />
I think the studio bit off more than they could chew with this one. <br />
<br />

    Ok, let&#039;s be real. If you play the game, you&#039;re gonna love it. <br />
If you don&#039;t, it&#039;s better to stay away.<br />
<br />
For those who play the game, it&#039;s a great anime adaptation for your ships, their character has been adapted very well, even in the absence of a commander. Plus, you finally get to figure out how ship rigging works. <br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t play the game.... well, it&#039;s an anime about a bunch of girls with extra fan service shooting each other with ship equipment. If you&#039;re into seeing girls fool around for 20 minutes, go right ahead. If not, you&#039;ll find the anime sort of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322646">
        stale.<br />
<br />
Soooo, tldr: Do you play the game? Watch it. No? Don&#039;t.<br />
<br />
As for me, I play the game too much, instead of writing this review I could be grinding 3-4 again.

    First of all, I&#039;m gonna say what I like about this garbage adaptation, and that&#039;s the sound effects,bgm played during the fights, the gunfire and clashing of metal is amazing and convinced me that they can do good war anime IF THEY TRIED. The voice acting is superb and is just like how I hear it in the game. The opening is also amazing, makes me feel like a commander but its completely wasted on this show.<br />
<br />
Now here comes my rant. The story is hot garbage, I know I just watched 7 episodes but I can pretty much tell they wont improve it at all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322610">
        in the remaining 5 episodes. There is way too many plot points mashed together that makes it difficult to focus while watching, kinda like how Zack Snyder mashed multiple comic books to make that horrible batman V superman movie. The director stated on twitter he plans to do different sub stories for each episode which is a joke. Thats now how you write a story, cant believe this is the same guy that made Girisaia no Kaijutsu. The pacing is also very bad, at times it feels slow and then we have a dumb forced action battle without any reasoning or motivation. The characters are also nothing like the game and also doesn&#039;t act like them which removes their unique charm. There is zero world-building and explanations for whats going on, its like the director is just making shit up as he goes along and cannot justify it properly. I also don&#039;t feel anything for the characters or the plot, I felt more emotions playing the game&#039;s limited time events. The show is also missing an extremely important character, you all know who that is, and that character helps keep all in balance.<br />
<br />
The animation is also horrendous, feels like I&#039;m watching an anime from 2006 with all the poor proportions that&#039;s noticeable in multiple frames, the fight scenes in first 3 episodes and 7th episode was decent but not the remaining episodes, also the 7th episode is truly one of the worst episode I have seen so far because it betrays the lore and is just painful to watch. People should stop giving the typhoon excuse, every studio managed to get by that this season, it would have been better to just delay the show if it were such a huge obstacle.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t mind the fan-service but although it does feel extremely forced at times, like episode 6, and even then the fan-service wasn&#039;t very good. I think the director should have watched kantai collection before making this, that show isn&#039;t also that good but at least it gets the points I rambled about right, such as characters, KC&#039;s characters had more unique charm than this abomination. Also really hate how this show has inspired one of the most worst &quot;ship&quot; between two main characters, just ugh.<br />
<br />
Overall rating: 2/10. Just give it the full metal alchemist brotherhood treatment and this time make it exactly like the game, this original crap just does it not work for me

    Let me preface this review by saying I won&#039;t be rating this show base on how well it adapts things from the game but rather as a standalone title. I suspect other reviews will be referencing the game a lot but not in this review; this is because I have never played the game before. Before watching, I knew absolutely nothing about this show other than the fact there is an abundance of really fantastic hentai of it. I have fapped countless times to to some of the characters but that&#039;s all I knew coming into the show. In fact, I initially thought all the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320622">
        lewds were based on an existing show; imagine my surprise when I found out it was actually from a game and that they were turning my some of my favorite doujin waifus into an anime!<br />
<br />
So, about the show. From what I understand of the plot, it seems to be like a weird take on WW2 (but not exactly). It&#039;s about a bunch of girls that are actually war ships? or something like that. We got Japan and Germany (they even call themselves the Red Axis) vs America and UK vs ... Aliens? They&#039;re all fighting because they don&#039;t like each other and that seems to be the gist of it. Not an amazing plot but that&#039;s okay because I&#039;m not here for that kind of plot.<br />
<br />
From what I&#039;ve seen, the show is gonna mainly be about 2 things: girls and fights. The warship girls concept is interesting: you got some girls who are carriers and can send out planes and you got other girls that are just battleships. Not idea if there&#039;ll be submarine girls, but the concept is pretty fun. So far the fights are pretty simple but being a war and all I&#039;m expecting some more strategic fights later. But the fights scenes have been relatively fun to watch so far and are enjoyable, if nothing spectacular.<br />
<br />
And then you got the girls. There are so many of them that I can&#039;t keep up with the names for most of them; it&#039;s a little overwhelming to be honest. But that&#039;s okay, I&#039;m only interested in the ones that I... came for. I instantly recognised them and I was super happy (maybe too happy?) to see them. I had no idea the cast was so big, and I think I&#039;ve taken a liking to some new girls too. The show is pretty much all about these girls, but with so many it&#039;ll be interesting to see if it&#039;s possible to give enough time to each one for significant enough character development, particularly for someone who hasn&#039;t played the game and knows nothing about each one. Hopefully certain girls will get more screen time too...<br />
<br />
So do I recommend the show? If you&#039;ve never spent quality time with any of the girls before in any form, then it might not be worth watching. Nothing in particular stands out about the show and you might be a little overwhelmed with the sheer number of different characters that keep popping up. There&#039;s plenty of other great stuff to watch so you might want to spend your time watching those things instead. But if you do decide to give it a try, it&#039;s not bad enough that you&#039;ll regret watching. It&#039;s alright.<br />
<br />
But if you&#039;ve previously familiarised yourself with some of the girls (or want to, after being informed from this review) and your right (or left) hand is tired from... holding your phone, maybe consider setting it aside and giving this a watch.

    Azur lane? More like Azur lame.<br />
<br />
This series makes no sense.<br />
Let me explain. <br />
This series is supposed to be about aliens coming to conquer earth but instead we have the iron blood and Sakura empire at war with the Royal Navy and eagle union. So far I only see Sakura empire vs Royal Navy and eagle union. Iron blood is totally absent except for a few cameo. Alien evaders? What Alien evaders?<br />
<br />
Ayanami should be branded a traitor. I mean she rather be with the enemy?<br />
She rather not shoot at the enemy when they have no problem firing at her comrades? She enjoys her time as their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review360430">
        prisoner of war. She says her Sakura empire friends are important to her but she makes no attempt to escape. She is not missed, no wonder her friends at the Sakura empire does not even bother to attempt to rescue her.<br />
<br />
Battles are pointless as no one gets injured or die.<br />
The higher ups at the Sakura empire are shown to have all the awesome weapons but never ever participate in any battles?<br />
The girls said it themselves that they are not human but battle ships so why are they seen eating and having meals? Throughout the series I was siding the sirens hoping they would destroy any one of the series’s characters.<br />
<br />
Skip this series, go watch Kancolle instead.<br />

    Man, where do I start.<br />
<br />
Azur Lane is a repulsive, boring, disgusting waste of anyone and everyone&#039;s time. So much so, that I have chosen to write my first review for the sole purpose of dogging on this terrible series.<br />
<br />
Story 2/10: The only reason I didn&#039;t give this portion a 1/10 was because the story in this anime is somewhat conceivable. The characters actions as well as the world itself can be somewhat made out. However, just because a story can be seen, does not mean that it is a pretty one. I have never personally been too big a fan of Naval combat or sea

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399926">
        based stories so when I was met with the raw amount of inconsistencies in the pacing and overall telling of this story I was appalled to say the least. To top this all off the overall message of &quot;we aren&#039;t that different after all,&quot; and crude attempts at heartfelt moments expressed by the end of the show are some of the poorest tries at some of the poorest most overused tropes imaginable. <br />
<br />
Art 1/10: As weak as this anime was. This was by far one of the weakest portions. Watching this genuinely made me mad that a studio could mess something up this hard. There are vivid moments in my memory of characters mouths not being drawn all the way, making it so that when they open their mouth to speak there is nothing but a white abyss inside, no tongue, no teeth, nothing. It&#039;d be one thing if this was consistent because maybe you could pass it off as &quot;a unique style,&quot; but no, they actually just screwed up that much as it only happened two or three times and was for roughly 10 seconds at a time. Mistakes aside, the art style for this anime was extremely poor and unoriginal. None of the colors popped and everything just looked extremely bland, making even the action scenes extremely unexciting and dull.<br />
<br />
Sound 2/10: I&#039;m not gonna write a lot here because I genuinely remember nothing about the soundtrack of this show, despite watching the opening and ending all the way through each episode. It being the least memorable part of this garbage excuse for television easily makes it the most redeeming portion of the series, thus the 2/10.<br />
<br />
Characters 1/10: Nearly every character throughout the entire series showed very little interesting development. The closest thing to character growth we saw was seeing Enterprises mentality change from the first episode to the last which was one of the most useless subplots of the entire thing as it, like everything else in this show, ultimately led to nowhere. I&#039;d say the most interesting characters throughout this entire series were the Sirens themselves which receive a collective 8 minutes of screentime throughout this 288 minute pile of crap. Other than the previously mentioned characters, everyone else just follows basic character tropes with no innovation making up for arguably the most forgettable cast of characters imaginable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 1/10: This was the most agonizing piece of media I have ever forced myself to sit through. I have never come closer to dropping a series and I felt every. god. damn. second. of this anime as it went by. I would only recommend this to the most distinguished of masochists who can only experience pleasure through the most tremendously painful of experiences. The only thing I have gained from this viewing experience is that now if I find myself in a tough situation I can always tell myself &quot;c&#039;mon, you finished Azur Lane you can get through this.&quot; Please don&#039;t watch this if you value your mentality in any way.<br />
<br />
Overall 1/10

    Ah yes, Azur Lane. The popular mobile game now has an anime adaptation. Now, I&#039;m not particularly a fan of the game but I went into this with a fair judgement.<br />
<br />
Story - 3<br />
The story, well, to put it short: it&#039;s bad. There&#039;s a very rushed intro scene where they attempted to cram the entire backstory into like, 15 minutes. This makes viewers who are not hardcore fans of the game confused about what&#039;s going on. The plot onwards on goes here, there and everywhere. For a game about battling this anime sure as hell doesn&#039;t have a lot of it; most of it consists of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321149">
        fanservice (some of it quite frankly disgusting) with a very small portion of action.<br />
<br />
Art - 6<br />
When it shines, it looks great. Backgrounds are colourful and the cast look great. However, for Bibury&#039;s first show, there sure as hell is a load of budget cuts. After episode 1 the animation quality plummets massively. Very clear shots where the characters have a blank face, weird choppy movements and an overuse of poorly done CGI make what was decent art unenjoyable to look at. Then again, if you don&#039;t mind a few large drops here and there you won&#039;t really notice this.<br />
<br />
Sound - 5<br />
Nothing special here. Opening is catchy.<br />
<br />
Character - 6<br />
The characters are varied, although there is practically no backstory shown, and they look nice. That&#039;s about it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 4<br />
Now, I thought episode 1 was pretty sick. The opening is a jam and the action was pretty cool. Episodes 2-4 were boring. Episode 3&#039;s fanservice on the beach scene made me feel sick.<br />
<br />
Overall - 5<br />
If you&#039;re a fan of the game, and don&#039;t mind a lot of ecchi content, watch it. If not, I advise you to steer clear of this show.<br />
<br />
(This is my first review here, apologies if I made any mistakes.)

    Azur Lane (2019)<br />
<br />
[Spoiler Warning]<br />
<br />
Now, people can be upset by the delay and I totally appreciate that. But, overall the series was pretty damn great. <br />
<br />
In terms of best girls, what can I say? I say girl&#039;s because there is not just one. <br />
<br />
Cleveland since the bath scene is my overall best girl. Adorable reaction. <br />
Nagato is second best because she is so cute. <br />
Akashi because her cat things are insanely cute and her hands like paws when she talks.<br />
Z23 because she is a great character in a cute outfit.<br />
Prinz Eugen is our sadistic waifu character.<br />
Ayanami is just generally cute and when her sisters are with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332223">
        her it is insane. <br />
Laffey in Japanese has the most adorable voice. <br />
Unicorn is just generally cute and sweet. <br />
Warspite because she looks cute and also because her role as the Knight. <br />
Sheffield because she is a bit lewd (Bath scene that made Cleveland top girl) and her voice is adorable. <br />
The Siren Tester she is pretty good Waifu material. <br />
The Bullin girls at the last episode are pretty cute. <br />
San Diego when her ship is wrecked is pretty funny. <br />
Long Island again is pretty cute. <br />
Hood and her elegance are just awesome. <br />
Ark Royal with her lolicon nature is hilarious. <br />
Admiral Hipper is adorable with her reactions especially. Proper Tsundere. <br />
Zuikaku and Shoukaku make a great pair together. <br />
Amagi is great too, great older sister type. <br />
Akagi and Kaga being foxes with such great tails to fluff are perfect in their own way. <br />
<br />
Effectively it is cute ship girls doing cute things and also combat. I could list many more but I want you to watch it and find them yourselves. <br />
<br />
Now I would love to have seen more of the girls as I play the game. <br />
<br />
For me, the story was pretty good. It is very similar to a few other franchises but then all Isekai are basically the same story, so this story can be recycled often too quite happily. <br />
<br />
The art of the show did vary throughout with at some points being pretty bad but at others is pretty good. I did hope the delay would have made the last two episodes flawless but that was not what happened. It is still a great work of art. <br />
<br />
The sounds in Japanese the voices are all great. The dub is great too but it makes it more a comedy because of how each nation is represented in voice structure. Battles are greatly done too. <br />
<br />
Characters are greatly varied all over the place and are awesome. It was great even at the end to see Z23 being accepted into the starter ship group. <br />
<br />
For enjoyment, I can honestly say I loved it. It got me playing the game when it first came out and I love the franchise as a whole. <br />
<br />
Overall despite its flaws, the show is great. It is entertaining, a bit ecchi and also flows nicely. It has a great ending that finishes it but also leaves a ton of room for more to come. I would absolutely love to see more seasons come for it or even a movie. Much worse shows have been renewed in the past. <br />
<br />
Also like I said the dub is hilarious. Watch it in Japanese with subs for serious watch and then in dub for a comedic one. It isn&#039;t bad just hilariously done. <br />
<br />
*Edit: Also the Submarine girl was great to see. <br />
<br />

    Gotta Say, i get my enjoyment out of the Series.<br />
<br />
Problem is that a Couple things make no forking Sense:<br />
1. They Portray it like Enty is the Fucking God of Shipfus who shall Smite all the Heathens <br />
    standing up against her.<br />
    Don&#039;t get me wrong, Enty deals Damage like Hell (even though Hornet deals even more), but <br />
    apart  from that her Stats are *mostly* Average to a bit over Average.<br />
    In the Anime, she, Belfap and Sheffuck are on some Kirito levels of OP.<br />
<br />
2. When Enty is the God of Shipfus,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321371">
        Belfast and Sheffield are her Testicles and Schlong.<br />
     Simillar Problem to Enty, apart from that they&#039;re (Stats Wise) actually some of the Best CL&#039;s in <br />
     Game.<br />
     Whenever there&#039;s a Problem that can&#039;t be solved by God, Belfap and Sheffcock come in to <br />
     save the Day.<br />
    The Plot Armor is Real with this one<br />
<br />
3. I may be Biased towards Prinz and Z23, but do you actually want to Tell me that they&#039;re <br />
    Weaker than Shitfield and Bellfast?<br />
   I have those Shpis, and i can assure you that Pudding and Z23  Absolutely Shred Belfast and <br />
   Fuckfield.<br />
  (If you haven&#039;t noticed, i utterly despise Sheffbitch in both the Game and Anime, she&#039;s a <br />
   Massive Bitch. Fuck that.) <br />
   I really like Belfast though.<br />
<br />
4. Why the Jigglemadingdong is God Stronger than Akagi and Kaga, i mean, together they are <br />
    literally the Ideal Counter-Shipfus for Miss &quot;Greyu Ghosturru&quot;.<br />
<br />
5. It&#039;s just a General Bummer that they gave no Shit about the Ships actual Stats in Game.<br />
   So far i like that they deviate from the Games Story, even though i have no Clue in which<br />
   direction they&#039;re going with this.<br />

    from what i sees till episode 10 this is my though:<br />
<br />
i don&#039;t play the game, but i saw someone play it and im review the story. since i like to hear bout the story more than &quot;fan service&quot;, so from what i can see the story pretty good but its too much on azur lane side more than the opposing side. more like allied propaganda for me so far lmao, which is really unfortunate that i can&#039;t give good score to this anime. since this is fantasy, we need more screen from opposing side too, &quot;if they gonna make sequel that&#039;s it&quot; which is the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330483">
        crimson path if i remember correctly. and give them winning side too, not just AZUR LANE.<br />
<br />
not to be mean, but for those weebs who expect more fan service, remember that that thing of clothe, every girls dont wanna to put those skimpy stuff. face the reality if u score this anime just because its not too much fan service or stuff. i give them not so good or bad score because base on the story, i like the concept of those 4 big country in conflict, its not like i always like conflict stuff but at least its more realistic when there&#039;s technology there always be war. it just the view on this anime so far as i can see just point at the azur lane side. sorry if it make u mad but dont just score this anime base on fan sevice like they do in game!<br />
<br />
overall i can just give 5 score im sorry. i like the idea but the story is pretty much meh, since it just only focus on certain faction. we even don&#039;t have many screen from iron blood nor their hometown too.
