    This film has less than 10 minutes of original animation. A full 80 minutes is scenes from the original series.<br />
<br />
Is this a recap film? No, a recap would have at least been tolerable. The reused material attempts to establish an alternate plotline where Rei and Charles had already adopted Renton long before Renton encountered them in the series. It even goes as far as to re-dub some footage to convey this alternate plot.<br />
<br />
Again, this might have been okay if done well, but it wasnt. The editing is all over the place, cutting between scenes with little relevance to eachother. There are probably 20 &quot;X Days

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258296">
        Ago&quot; title cards scattered throughout the film. Lastly, nearly every scene is subtitled with expository text which provides zero benifit to the plot. At some points half of the screen was covered with text.<br />
<br />
What about the music? Even I could forgive this film if it had some sweet new soundtrack, but it doesnt. The soundtrack was bland and mostly reused songs. The main theme &quot;Glory Days&quot; doesnt play until the credits roll.<br />
<br />
Honestly it&#039;s like they only had enough budget for a short film, but wanted to make a full length film anyway, so they just gave a 12 year old Windows Movie Maker and raw footage from the original series and let them go ham.

    [Note: This review assumes you have seen at least the original Eureka Seven TV anime. As such, there will be spoilers for it within this review.]<br />
<br />
Well, Studio Bones is at it again! Out of all the original series they make (and they’ve made plenty) Eureka Seven seems to be a favorite to many. But to be fair, why wouldn’t it be? The original 2005 series is a stone cold classic, with its arresting visuals, compelling lead romance, and just a grand adventurous tone through and through. I’ll make it no secret that I love it dearly, and its been my favorite anime for nearly 6

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271204">
        years now. It just does so much wonderful that I can’t help but wear a smile anytime I rewatch it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, with that much praise comes bank to be made on it. And with that bank comes Bones trying to make the magic strike once again. Their first attempt, Pocketful of Rainbows, was an alternate take on the series featuring some reused footage and had some interesting ideas going for it. It was never going to live up to the original, but for what it was it was harmless. The same cannot be said for their next attempt: the infamous Eureka Seven AO. Truth be told, I haven’t seen it myself. But everything I’ve heard makes it seem like seeing it would be the last thing any fan of the original would want. AO was pretty much the lowest point in the series, and many just thought it was done after such a botched follow up.<br />
<br />
Perhaps trying to wash away AO’s taint, Bones is taking the old horse out for another try. The Hi Evolution trilogy was announced last year, with the original staff and cast from both languages returning. With the first installment releasing last year in Japan, nerves have never been more on edge. Fans waiting with baited breath to see if they shit the bed once again. And from the first screening at Otakon last summer, reception was...mixed at best. Much of anitwitter was ablaze, claiming that the bed was indeed shat in; some going so far as to say that it was just as bad, if not worse than AO. But with its American release finally here, it must be asked: do those claims ring true? Is Hi Evolution 1 just another blemish on the original? Is it truly worse than AO? To answer this, I must put aside my biased love towards the original series. And now I can say with confidence that this new film is, surprisingly, really damn great. Though truthfully not for everyone.<br />
<br />
The overall plot of the film can be broken down into two parts: the first is the story of the Summer of Love. That often talked about but never shown event is finally shown in full glory, as is the story of the man who saved the world, Adroc Thurston. The second part shifts the focus onto the familiar face of Renton Thurston, as he reflects on his past experiences with both Eureka and his adoptive parents, Charles and Ray. For in this continuity, Renton was adopted by the Beams right after his father vanished, and so it’s from them he runs away from to follow Eureka.<br />
<br />
Let’s get the obvious praise out of the way: The Summer of Love section is amazing. The first 20-25 minutes is basically one big action scene, and it is jam packed with awesomeness. We’ve got Scub antibodies blasting away at KLF units. We’ve go lasers and missiles flying sky high and exploding into big beautiful bursts of color. We’ve even got a giant missile that transforms into the equivalent of a rave party; god almighty, it is amazing. But it doesn’t stop there, we’ve got plenty of great character moments to boot. It’s great to see Charles and Ray again, and they get a bulk of the early action in the scene. Holland and Dewey actually looking out for and calling each other “brother” is something i never knew I wanted, and it&#039;s amazing. It’s impossible to watch it without feeling pumped up.<br />
<br />
What’s more, they actually manage to one-up the original series by actually giving Adroc some character. In the series, he was dead by then, and more acted as a symbol for many of the characters. Here, he’s given some depth and it’s quite well done. The film portrays Adroc as a man who genuinely wants to help the world. Someone who is desperate to stop a doomsday plan he created, and laments all the pain caused by his actions. It really succeeds at humanizing him, making him more than just the legendary figure of the original show. All those elements makes his sacrifice all the more powerful in a truly beautiful sequence. The entire Summer of Love was just one big lump of fanservice to the original show, meant to please the fans in every possible way, and it unquestionably succeeded. And then the rest of the film happened and things got more complicated.<br />
<br />
See, the controversial reception this film has doesn’t come from the story being told. No, it comes from the way that it was told. Hi Evolution 1 takes a decidedly non linear approach to telling Renton’s tale. Signaled by the words “Play Back” and “Play Forward”, the film leaps throughout parts of Renton leaving the Gekko and his reunion with his adoptive parents. Fans of the original series will recognize these events, in particular Renton’s encounter with the Vodarac girl and his specific reason from running away in the first place. Many have complained that this style of storytelling was too confusing and hard to follow, but for me it wasn’t so. Everything followed a thematic throughline about Renton’s maturation, and it didn’t hop along too large of time gaps. Plus, if you’ve seen the original show, you should know where these events line up time wise. The criticism perhaps comes from how unexpected it was, which while certainly true proved to shake up the original version of these stories.<br />
<br />
To be frank, the film basically requires you to be familiar with the original series. It doesn’t really touch on Renton’s life aboard the Gekko, nor his relationship with Eureka; instead assuming you already know about everything Renton went through and giving the new information needed for this trilogy. Some may be aghast at those changes, and while I sympathize, I must also disagree. Had the film gone over that material it would’ve basically been the same as in the original series. Then you would’ve had people complaining about how the film retreaded too much of the same stuff. Some may certainly argue that reusing moments from the series in the first place was a mistake, and while that may have merit, the way they went about telling it was the most interesting approach.<br />
<br />
Some will also be disappointed to know that the focus is kept primarily on Renton. In fact, the film kind of turns into a character study of him, squaring in on his reasons for running away and his own problems with relating to Eureka. The elements explored are similar to the ones from the TV series, but they are different. Most notably, it is much harsher on Renton. This section of the original show was a dark time for him, and this film carries that over very well, and then some. It explores how, while he genuinely wants to be a good person, it’s difficult for him to understand what people really want. This was lightly touched on in the series, but here it’s put more front and center as the big character hurdle Renton has to overcome. It’s no coincidence also that the scenes taken are the ones that most strongly reflect that theme.<br />
<br />
His encounter with the Vodarac girl proved to be the key example of that hurdle in the original series, and it’s just as much here, but different in a subtle way. In the original, after Renton is brought back to the Swan, Charles comforts him by saying that he doesn’t begrudge his actions; that what he did was “the right thing to do as a human”, but that they didn’t know if the girl really wanted what Renton thought she did. In Hi-Evolution, while Charles still sympathises with Renton, he’s fairly more harsher on him: saying instead that Renton did what he truly thought was right, but that there was no way he could have known if it was for the best. It’s a subtle change, but Hi-Evolution’s version call Renton’s actions into question more and is shown to have a bigger impact on him. And while we don’t see much of her interactions with Renton here, Eureka is shown to be different as well. She’s a lot colder emotionally than she was initially at this point, and her conversation with Renton before he runs away shows that as well. She, too, was more willing to draw attention to Renton’s actions, and the repercussions they had. As such, in the same way that Adroc’s sacrifice is strengthened by his characterization, so too is Renton’s when he once more leaves Charles and Ray. The production name of this film was “Renton Seven”, and that is undoubtedly what this feels like; a story about Renton, his maturation, and where he will go from here.<br />
<br />
If I had to point to the films largest shortcomings, it would be its attempt at trying to appeal to newcomers. Text appears often that is meant to explain certain elements that may be unfamiliar to newcomers. Some are actually quite helpful and interesting, such as one explaining the Trapar Waves and the military connections of the characters. Often, however, it’s just running down information that is somewhat unnecessary, and often actually spoil some parts of the series. If they wanted to get newcomers in, they shouldn’t have revealed Eureka’s identity as a human form Corallian, for instance. In fact, I get the feeling that even the writers were aware of the issues with the constant text, and actually played them for laughs in some cases. There’s a text line about helmet wearing rules in Bellforest, and even one explaining what tacos are. Still, the text is somewhat easy to phase out of your mind. But it was a mistake to try to appeal to newcomers in a film like this. This is a film for fans, first and foremost, and we already know most of this stuff. <br />
<br />
In terms of visuals, the film devilers in a way you may not expect. Obviously, the Summer of Love is the high point: it’s a delectable smorgasbord of mecha action, gorgeous shot composition, and is a true sight to behold. It’s probably some of the best giant robot footage put to the big screen, and among the best Bones has produced. But after that, the film heavily uses footage from the original series during Renton’s portion of the film. Many have criticized this as a lazy move, and while new footage would’ve been amazing, its use is actually kind of smart. Using it during the primarily flashback-centered part of the movie is thematically appropriate; just as Renton remembers what’s happened to him, we too remember seeing these events from the original. But they didn’t just slap the old animation on and call it a day; they’ve actually cleaned it up quite a bit. Subtle changes to the line work, new background elements, even redrawing some scenes for a greater effect. What was once the Ray=Out magazine is now a governmental propaganda magazine, Hardfloor album covers are seen on Charles’ wall. My favorite would be a certain character appearing to have a vastly different role here, even if she doesn’t appear physically. It succeeds in giving off a surreal vibe; a feeling that what your watching is Eureka Seven, but is still different from the original. Admittedly, the aspect ratio change during this part is annoying, but it’s a minor detail for me at least.<br />
<br />
Naoki Sato returns to the score, and it’s as great as ever. The film doesn’t rely too heavily on his original pieces from the TV series (I think they use one song from it and that’s it). Highlights include pretty much the entire Summer of Love sequence; that booming orchestral score is just eargasmic (is that a word? I hope so). In a surprising move, german trance musicians Hardfloor composed a song for this: Acperience 7. Playing during the Summer of Love, it’s a techno feast for the ears, and a straight up banging tune to boot. Considering that Hardfloor’s “Acperience” song was used as the title for a number of the TV shows episodes, it’s very fitting. Additionally, the ending song, Hiroya Ozaki’s “Glory Days”, is a phenomenal piece that really captures the feeling of the series.<br />
<br />
As for the VA work, I watched the english dub. Somehow, Funimation managed to pull off the impossible and got the entire original cast back. Equally amazing is that they slip back into their roles without much of a hitch. It’s great to here all these voices again, especially Patrick Seitz and Melissa Fahn as Charles and Ray. Hell, they even got Dewey’s VA back, and he does great too. The big new addition is Fred Tatasciore as Adroc, and while I was surprised when they first announced him, within the first few lines he sold me completely. He captures all the pain and anguish Adroc goes through while also never seeming too overdramatic. In short, he’s exactly how you imagined the character sounding, and is probably the best performance in the whole film. If I had to critique the acting, it would mostly revolve around Renton. Not that it’s a bad performance; it’s quite a solid one on the whole. It’s just that Renton sounds...different. Johnny Yong Bosch still voices him, but either he can’t pull off the same voice as the original or the dub decided to tone down the pitch he originally used. Regardless, it’s still the same Renton voice underneath, and you get used to it quickly. Either way, it’s a stellar dub all around.<br />
<br />
Of course, this is only part 1. The film ended with a preview for Hi-Evolution 2 which looked so insane and crazy that it made me even more hyped for it. It would seem that this series is going to be one giant, big tribute to everything Eureka Seven. If so, than this film can only be truly judged as part of one whole entity that is the Hi Evolution trilogy. Even those who disliked this film, from what I’ve seen, expressed interest in the sequel, curious as to where this is all heading. And that’s really what this film was: a giant piece of set up for the sequels. But rather than have it just be that, the crew at Bones decided to make it something truly memorable and different, yet still feel like Eureka Seven. <br />
<br />
I can, of course, see why many would dislike this film. But the claim that this is worse than AO is just nonsense; at least this is set in an alternate universe and doesn’t screw up the original shows plot. Hi-Evolution 1 ended up being an interesting and very well done jumping off point for things yet to come. It succeeds in reminding you of what the feeling of Eureka Seven is, while also providing enough changes to keep you interested. At the very least, the Summer of Love part is worth seeing, but I enjoyed the rest of the film just as much. I know I’ll be there for everything to happen in part 2, but until then, all we can do is wait for that day, that most glorious of days, to arrive.<br />

    I’ve seen this movie get a lot of hate and I totally understand it. The movie is sort of confused, disjointed and weird. That being said I think I loved it? Hear me out!<br />
<br />
Even if it was reanimated for a lot of the scenes, it is still gorgeous. The weird pacing and skipping between different times came together beautifully in the end. I loved being immersed in the world and characters again. I get what the director means when he says that this will hold up better when all three movies are out.<br />
<br />
Full disclosure: I love eureka seven, it is easily my favorite show. That

        being said I hated Pocket Full of Rainbows and have never seen Astral Ocean. I went in expecting to hate this, but instead I felt the same energy and inspiration I got from the original series. This movie has convinced me to give them another shot. The movies messy at sometimes muddled but so is the show, it’s a retelling from a director that I think wants to deliver something even closer to his original vision.<br />
<br />
I understand why some people hate this movie, but I loved it. I plan on watching all the sequels as they come out. I hope some fans will see this and ignore some of the negative press the movie has received and I hope more give it a shot.

Eureka Seven: Hi Evolution show it&#039;s potential at the start of the film by showing Fresh new animation of the First Summer of love, this newly animated scene is fantastic, it shows the potential of what could possibly come from the Trilogy, but sadly this doesn&#039;t last long, the majority of the film is reused clips from the Original Series that shows the events with Charles and Ray up until Renton Leaves their ship, this becomes confusing to new viewers as they Jump back and forth between time frames a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review260824">
        lot and viewers that are new the series are easily lost when watching this. It is a shame that it is mostly old stuff especially with how the new animation looks! There is a teaser for the Second film in the Trilogy in which they show more new Animation and I hope there is less of the Play Back and Forward stuff as it is used far to much.<br />
<br />
There is always something over the screen telling you what things are and give descriptions of what is happening, time frames and Descriptions of the KLF which I really though was a good addition but used way to much as it&#039;s happening throughout the whole film a lot.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is the same style that was enjoyed from the original series and is a great techno synth which is just upbeat and fitting. Glory Days is good and is still stuck in my head from listening to it for the first time!<br />
<br />
This film calls a lot to the fans of the original series but I&#039;d say that it will be mostly them that will get a kick out of the film as I did but will disappointed with the lack of new content added to the Series. New comers to the series will be lost with the amount of jumping back and forth that takes place and will struggle to keep up. <br />
<br />
The film shows potential but falls a bit with the lack of new content which is a shame. <br />

    I&#039;ll try to be brief because I&#039;m not great at articulating my thoughts. And some *SPOILERS* for those that want to see this still. This &quot;movie&quot; starts out promising enough with Adroc Thurston trying to save the world...even though, from the sounds of it, he was at fault for it all in the first place. New animation, new music, and we hadn&#039;t seen this story in all of Eureka Seven before. (At least that I can recall, it has been a while since I had watched the series in its entirety.) So Hi-Evolution takes a step in the right direction and then takes a huge

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289024">
        step backward to tell its incomplete story of Renton Thurston (Beams?).<br />
<br />
The story after the introduction (and death) of Adroc focuses entirely on Renton and his relationship with Ray and Charles. It briefly touches about the weight that Renton has to deal with being the son of Adroc, but nothing in depth. His sister and his grandfather are nowhere to be seen or heard. It hardly scratches the surface of Renton&#039;s time with Gekkostate, and worse yet barely covers Renton and Eureka&#039;s relationship. Holland is still an asshat, but for some reason this is part of his charm...newcomers will have no idea why though. They hint how Dewey become the Dewey Novak we know from the series. The movie is not quite clear if it is telling a brand new story or if it is telling a jumbled version of the series. <br />
<br />
As someone who fell in love with the series, I followed this as well as I think any fan would but it jumps back and forth in time far too much. And why is there so much text on the screen?! I fail to imagine that many non-fans went to see this, and good Lord if you didn&#039;t see three lines of text on every scene change. This movie over explains every little detail with the text and almost tries to distract you from what is going on screen. Another thing that disappointed me, but bears no weight on the overall product, was that JYB forgot how to Renton. There are flashes of the voice still being there but after 10+ years after the fact I think JYB can be forgiven for not being able to replicate the voice like he did in the series and Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers. (I&#039;d mention Stephanie Sheh&#039;s Eureka if she was in the movie for more than a handful of scenes.) Still, to repeat, that did break my heart a little.<br />
<br />
To me I feel like Tomoki Kyoda and Dai Sato maybe didn&#039;t quite understand what made Eureka Seven resonate with us. Aside from the pretty good opening, this movie is a jumbled mess. And while I was happy to see it focus on two characters that deserved a better fate in the series it disregards and jumps around way too much to be enjoyable and, better yet, comprehensible. I almost feel too nice to be giving this movie the score I&#039;m giving it. But there are some nice moments in between it all, you just might not be able to make sense it when it happens.

    My biggest worry going into this was about the rumor that they were going to add original footage about Adroc Thurston and the Summer of Love. One of the key thematic arcs of the show was Renton&#039;s feelings of resentment for his father&#039;s reputation as a hero, having to live in the shadow of someone who lived this exciting life and became a hero to the entire world. We never got to see the Summer of Love in the show, so the gravity of what Adroc did got to be filled in by our imagination. How could they actually depict Adroc&#039;s sacrifice and make it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270841">
        stand up next to our imagination?<br />
<br />
By showing us just the last hours of his life and filling them with a million explosions as the world goes to fucking shit all around the main characters.<br />
<br />
The strategy of not explaining the complete nature of the Summer of Love or Adroc&#039;s part in the creation of the Silver Box that caused the Seventh Swell we see didn&#039;t just preserve the mystery of Adroc that is so core to the show: it accentuated them. Now we get to have our cake, this action-packed climax to the man&#039;s life, and eat it to by knowing just the right amount more about what occurred, such that the original show isn&#039;t tarnished. Not only is this a 10/10 masterpiece, it makes the original 10/10 masterpiece even better by proxy.<br />
<br />
But that&#039;s just the first 20-30 minutes or so. What the movie is actually about is Renton&#039;s relationship with Charles and Ray. I can&#039;t properly describe you the emotional swell I felt as the realization dawned on me that this wasn&#039;t going to be a straight rehashing of the show. The first part of this trilogy is a stylish re-edit of my favorite arc from one of my favorite shows of all time. I could cry. It was so beautiful to see, even if the 4:3 aspect ratio is outdated next to the widescreen of the opening and the remastered animation is still quite obviously TV-quality, not modern film quality. But what should we have expected? Bones to animate the sides of the frames so that all the scenes could be in widescreen while all the action was in 4:3? Nah. The Charles and Ray arc from the show can stand on its own very easily, so save that money for higher concentrations of original footage in 2 and 3, please.<br />
<br />
Charles and Ray is a microcosm of everything Eureka Seven was about. Renton meets them as the spoiled child who has rejected Eureka because of she wasn&#039;t the dream girl he idolized and expected her to be. He leaves them as someone who has a better grasp of the need to listen to other people and understand their differences so that he can respect them and go through the world more confidently. Making a movie about his relationship with them as a separate thing from his relationship with Eureka makes sense to me because it can be a standalone about growth in the aftermath of an undescribed massive disaster like Acperience was for Renton and Eureka. This very closely parallels how the show as a whole is about growth in the aftermath of the Summer of Love. More than that, the arc&#039;s presentation is edited and intercut such that the emotional gut punches of the arc just keep coming and coming and coming in an extremely methodical way.<br />
<br />
Using the lens we were given in Hi-Evolution 1 (and assuming for the sake of useful argument that 2 and 3 are strictly content from the show), I would totally expect someone only interested in watching the movies to get a good understanding of what Eureka Seven is about. They get a thematic summary with 1, then they&#039;ll see Renton grow up from nothing to a hero alongside Eureka while she does the same over the course of two more films. I&#039;m extremely looking forward to that and whatever the hell they have planned for those soccer KLFs and idol singing in the next episode preview.<br />
<br />
Even if you haven&#039;t seen the show, you owe it to yourself to watch this. If you have seen the series, this is an unforgettable way to experience an excellent arc of it (again, my favorite) in a new way. See this. It&#039;s not a replacement for Eureka Seven; it&#039;s a peerless companion to it. SEE THIS.

    Esperaba que fuese algo sorprendente siendo esta una película pero no, es difcil de seguirla con sus idas y vueltas a cada momento, es triste en cuanto a su banda sonora, parece que no había dinero para realizar pero la quisieron hacer igual, en partes te ponen datos que no sirven de nada, ya que la gente que ve estas películas, ya debió de haber visto el anime de 50 episodios <br />
Tiene un 20% de cosas nuevas y nuevos dialogos pero nada mas, los fotogramas tampoco son nada de otro mundo, en que estaban pensando cuando reutilizaron todo lo que ya tenian para hacer algo

    I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever written a review so I&#039;ll keep this one short.  I&#039;m disappointed again by yet another new attempt to spin Eureka Seven.  The original series is by far one of my most favorite animes.  Why do they insist on trying to remake it over and over again?  Where did the good writers go who wrote the original?  90% of this film is re-used footage.  The film is confusing to follow with all the scenes being played out of order.  There is far too much text on the screen throughout the movie, I had to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320591">
        keep pausing it for fear I was going to miss something.  I enjoyed the first 10 minutes of the film because it was new footage and a kind of prequel to the original story.  I recommend watching that and stopping, the rest is a complete and utter waste of your time.  I can not possibly express how utterly disappointed I am in this failure of a movie.

    I wrote in my review for the TV show that Eureka Seven did the recap clip show in a way no other show has done before or since: The edited clips were recut as though they were written as reports from 2 perspectives, one from the eyes of a counterculture magazine writer, the other as a military report by a young officer doing what he thought was the right thing. So it might be natural to think that Bones would introduce some new material and bring the old series new life with the same technique, right?<br />
<br />
Yeah, about that...<br />
<br />
I think they were trying to be a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407593">
        little too clever. They planned a movie, they got some sponsors together, they sketched out a story, they decided to add a bunch of prequel scenes, cool, cool cool cool. Then something threw a wrench in the works. Maybe the higher-ups didn&#039;t like the direction. Maybe they ran out of animator resources. Whatever the reason, there is only about 25 to 30 minutes of new content in a 90-minute film. Not nearly as atrocious as Macross Fb7, but still pretty bad.<br />
<br />
Fans of the show will no doubt be delighted to watch the new prequel sequence, and anime fans will also enjoy the performance of voice acting legend Toru Furuta, AKA Amuro Ray from Gundam. Honestly, if they packaged this on a Blu-ray as an OVA it would sell like hotcakes: It gives us some perspective of Holland and Dewey when they were inseparable brothers, it shows us Eureka not long after she was discovered, and it shows us just what transpired in the show&#039;s past to catapult Adroc Thurston to the &quot;hero of humanity&quot;. Unfortunately Diane, Renton&#039;s sister, doesn&#039;t make an appearance, even though she was a persistent, distant goal for Renton in the TV show, nor does his grandfather Axel (though this is understandable as his actor died years before the film&#039;s release). It&#039;s not a reinterpretation like the first film, it doesn&#039;t throw the show&#039;s lore and history into a blender like AO did (though there was a weird ding by changing Renton&#039;s surname and backstory by using subtitles), it&#039;s a solid addition to the canon.<br />
<br />
But it&#039;s only solid if they left it at those 25 to 30 minutes of new content.<br />
<br />
I get it. They needed to pad out the remaining hour, they needed to capture new fans, they were probably butting heads with the other studios working on the film, and they were probably running over budget, so even though fans of the TV show will be fast-forwarding through the latter two-thirds of the film, maybe there&#039;s someone new to the franchise who could see something they like about the heavily truncated, shoddily edited synopsis of the TV show up to episode 24-ish? Well, that&#039;s the thing, the first half of the TV show is a bit of a slog, and even if we cut it down to an hour like this, there is a significant amount of lost content that helped shape the world and the characters. I don&#039;t think a new viewer would get a very good grasp of the show, it&#039;s almost like trying to get the full experience of a nice cup of hot cocoa by pouring a packet of cocoa mix down one&#039;s throat. Also, there was probably nothing wrong with keeping the existing content chronological; I&#039;m used to Japanese shows frequently flashing back and forth, but seemingly doing it every 3 to 5 minutes, even with the &quot;flash back/forward&quot; cards, is honestly exhausting to watch.<br />
<br />
Naoki Sato, by this time a music powerhouse in his own right, wrote the score, and while I miss his soaring and dramatic tracks from the TV show, the music of the prequel was fittingly epic.<br />

I remember the &quot;alternate script&quot; the cast performed well after the TV show wrapped, it was as though the writers/directors had hundreds of stories they wanted to tell with this cast of characters and this world, but they couldn&#039;t for fear of creating a monstrosity instead of the &quot;symphonic psalms of planets&quot; they were aiming for, and with the film and sequel series they picked up the pieces from the cutting room floor without much of a plan to tie them together. This film represents a sort of return to basics, but it feels like Bones is jumping on the &quot;remake bandwagon&quot; that Hollywood and Gainax are infamous for by now. Had they kept it to the prequel and the chase scene, I think it would&#039;ve been a tighter, more solid production overall. Unfortunately, that&#039;s not what we got here.

    Why is it impossible for Bones to expand on one of its series? Nope once again they have to try and re-write it. No the entire world was devastated due to the summer of love, which doesnt really fit the rest of the movie. Renton was adopted by Charles and Ray Beams which makes no sense at all. The worst is the pacing it jumps around and is confusing to follow. <br />

You go in the past, then jump to present day day, then up to the past, then fast forward in the past, then rewind in the past, then jump to some time in the

I loved the original Eureka 7, in my top 5. Pocket full of rainbows was alternative dimension confusing garbage. AO was great until the whole time/dimension skipping, which ruined it. And now this...ugh and i was looking forward to this. Thought it was going to tell the story of how human found the planet/scub and Adrock/Dewey/Hollands/Talho&#039;s backstories
