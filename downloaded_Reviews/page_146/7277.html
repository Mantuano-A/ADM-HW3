    I haven&#039;t seen such lame main characters in my whole life.<br />
The anime would have been a little better if the main story was about their friends , the class president and that cute playboy.<br />
The main character-the boy wasn&#039;t even attractive or at least cool.  He didn&#039;t have anything to stand out or to be interesting in any way.<br />
The same goes with the girl.<br />
I thought it would have been a good rom com but this was beyond boring.<br />
The scenery and soundtracks made it even more boring and it was hard to keep watching till the end of each episode. <br />
The last 2 episodes had some

        interest but then again it failed tragically.<br />
I think I lost my time with this one. It was a complete contrast with other Rom-coms of the season like Tsurezure Children, Aho Girl, even Hajimete no Gal was  better and more interesting! <br />
I DON&#039;T RECOMMEND IT.

    When I watch an anime, I seldom/never care about the art or graphics. But this anime compels me to mention that it has great graphics (at least in my eyes), and the cast of many famous seiyuu in a single series was the motivating factor for me to pick this up, despite the synopsis that screamed &#039;TYPICAL&#039; as I looked it up online. As bonus, I was delighted to hear Kugimiya Rie not in her typical tsundere voice (I find this rare). But still, this is completely mitigated by the lack of originality in this anime. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a slice of life focusing on high school

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255820">
        romance, revolving around four characters; two guys and two girls, where the guys beat about the bush in every episode (at least, so far for the main guy) and the girls were oblivious to their feelings. To top the cliche, one of the couples were childhood friends and the guy realized the girl&#039;s existence in high school, so he started to hang around her like a closet pervert hoping to confess someday. Like, come on. What&#039;s gonna happen next? Main girl dies in the end like in some K-drama soap? *coughyourlieinaprilcough*<br />
<br />
Every episode felt like watching paint dry for eternity. Even Boys Be isn&#039;t as bad as this.

    Please note this review assumes that you have already finished watching Konbini Kareshi and while care has been taken to avoid story spoilers there may be spoilers in character analysis <br />
<br />
Romance, school life and a Konbini <br />
<br />
The premise of Konbini Kareshi is a relatively common one often seen in this genre. Konbini Kareshi is a slice of life and romance anime set in modern day Japan in a fictional town that looks like a normal town which makes it relatable to many. Using the Konbini as a focal point the anime uses this as a place where people can meet up, bond, strike up friendships

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258994">
        and purchase the items that they need to make memorable memories while attending high school. The overall story of the anime follows the school lives of four characters that include Haruki a honest and responsible high school freshman, Towa a bright and lively person that’s the joker of the group, Mami a quiet but serious girl and Miharu a positive and kind girl that gets nervous easily. After meeting each other on the first day of school and bonding with each other their relationships gradually starts to change as the months go by. As the months go by and as they encounter unexpected events and meet new classmates and friends how will these changes affect their relationship. <br />
<br />
Haruki <br />
<br />
Haruki Mishima voiced by veteran voice actor Takuma Terashima of Log Horizon fame is one of the main characters of the series. A 16-year-old high school freshman Haruki is an honest, kind and friendly person that because of his earnest and friendly nature is someone that can make friends easily. Due to his honest and earnest nature Haruki is someone that prefers to stay away from people’s gossip and disbelieves rumors and prefers to hear them from the concerned parties themselves. In the beginning of the series Haruki though honest and kind person was someone that can be said to lack any real goal in life seemingly to prefer to just live in the moment and not worry about anything else. This also has the effect of making it hard for him to understand people’s feelings which resulted in Haruki developing the personality trait of being indecisive with is his own feelings towards others. As the series progresses however Haruki starts to gradually change as he becomes more grounded, responsible and more determined to make his feelings known while also becoming more considerate and understanding of other’s feelings. <br />
<br />
Miharu <br />
<br />
Miharu Mashiki voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Sayaka Kanda of Sword Art Online fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the main heroines of the series. A 16-year-old high school freshman Miharu is a positive, kind and caring person that loves to help those in need and cares a great deal about her friends. Despite her earnest nature however Miharu is someone that gets nervous quite easily which is more prevalent in the beginning of the series. Despite this Miharu is someone that is noted to have a great deal of faith in people and always willing to believe in the best of them something that I find admirable about her. Unlike the other characters of the show Miharu due to her poor health is not someone that can afford to be athletic which I felt was a shame as sports meets and festivals are one of the joys in Japanese high schools. Perhaps as a means of not wasting the time that she must spend alone Miharu is noted to have a great deal in skill in handicrafts and in one notable scene makes use of this to support her friends a scene that I particularly liked. Miharu’s relationship with Haruki is one of the main points of the anime’s overall plot and unlike Mami’s one is a more complex one. <br />
<br />
In the beginning Miharu though seemingly, the childhood friend of Haruki instead treated him as a stranger and though their relationship gradually improved as the series went on the distance between the two gradually grew. But as their feelings for each other gradually grew this started to be reversed as she started to become braver and gradually become to him. As a character I felt that Miharu was an interesting character that was developed rather well as the series went on. Her unique circumstances I felt were used well in the series. The romance between Miharu and Haruki I felt was pretty sweet. <br />
<br />
Mami<br />
<br />
Mami Mihashi voiced by veteran seiyuu Rie Kugimiya of Persona 4 fame is one of the main characters of the series. A 16-year-old high school freshman Mami is the very image of what a student that’s entirely focused on her grades and future would look like. A hardworking, honest though overly serious person Mami is someone that takes everything in life seriously and though while earnest would often cause people to resent her for being too rule bound. Perhaps as a result of this pressure that she puts on herself Mami takes great pleasure in reading which is one of her favourite hobbies. Despite her serious nature Mami actually has a surprising side to her personality in that she likes to read girls manga which I find quite amusing as it offsets her more serious sided nature. As someone with a serious-minded personality it’s easy to assume that Mami is someone that’s accustomed to dealing with people since she also has the role of class rep that she shares with Towa as well but this is far from the truth. <br />
<br />
While having a serious personality Mami is also someone that’s very quiet and nervous and in the beginning of the series was seriously lacking in self-confidence not just in her personality but also in her appearance. More than anything Mami holds a fear that people will look at her differently if they find that such a serious-minded student is also a fan of manga as well. As a result of her nervous nature Mami is understandably nervous around boys but this has the effect of making her relationship with Towa that much more interesting since it also provides both a motivation and an opportunity for Mami to overcome these fears which are holding her back. Though the friendship between Mami and Towa admittedly did start off on the wrong foot but its progression from acquaintances to friends and then to partner I felt was done well considering the hurdles that both had to overcome.  Their love story I felt was cute as it focused on Mami’s various insecurities and personal traits and their combined efforts to overcome both this and Mami’s rather strict family and their wishes and aspirations for her. In the end I was glad that they managed to overcome all this and end up together. <br />
<br />
Towa <br />
<br />
Towa Honda voiced by veteran voice actor Kenichi Suzumura of Naruto fame is one of the main characters of the series. A 16-year-old high school freshman Towa is a bright, earnest and positive person that tries to act as the joker of the cast which is helped greatly by his funny personality. A childhood friend of Haruki’s that he knew from middle school Towa and Haruki have known each other for some time and as a result each are able to understand what the other is thinking about quite easily. While seemingly positive and loving to play jokes on people Towa’s inner personality is very different to what he tries to present to others in that Towa is actually a very lonely person that comes from having to wrestle against several problems that he cannot tell his friends about. <br />
<br />
In a way I felt that Towa’s struggles with is family and Mami’s struggles with the rules and aspirations that they have for her are pretty similar to each other and from there it’s quite easy to see how they actually bonded with each other. Though Towa’s relationship with Mami did not start off on the best of terms largely because of the approach that he took which caused her to actually fear him instead their relationship gradually improved as the series went on as Towa learnt to be more considerate and understanding towards not just Mami but to others as well. With regards to Towa’s character though I liked the contrast between his normally positive and joking self and his lonely self when he’s at home I felt that he could have been developed a bit more as compared to the rest of the main cast his development was rather limited. <br />
<br />
Mikado <br />
<br />
Mikado Nakajima voiced by veteran voice actor Shinnosuke Tachibana of Koi To Uso fame is one of the main characters of the series. A senior student and thus a sempai to Haruki and his fellow freshman Mikado is an honest, hardworking and logical person that has the role of student council president within the school. While seemingly laid back when compared with his second in command Masamune Mikado nonetheless is someone that takes his duties as student council president very seriously and when serious it can be seen that he can be pretty perceptive and logical. While Mikado can be strict he’s also someone that’s also fair and has surprisingly good sense of humor as well. While appearing to be a calm, composed and logical person it can be seen that Mikado as a result of being like this is someone that seems to be hiding what his true feelings are about something. Specifically, he seems to be reluctant to commit to a stable romantic relationship with a girl seemingly focused on his duties as SC president and taking charge of special school events. <br />
<br />
Waka <br />
<br />
Waka Kisaki voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yukari Tamura of Naruto and Ange Vierge fame is one of the main characters of the series. A senior student of the school and this Haruki and his fellow freshman’s sempai Waka is a positive, cheerful and kind person that’s also a bit care free for her age. A childhood friend of student council president Mikado Waka has a complicated relationship with Mikado in that despite not being blood related she affectionately calls him brother as a result of the childhood that they spent together.  In the beginning of the series it can be seen that her feelings towards Mikado is quite close but as a result of her childhood memories of seeing him as her brother Waka is reluctant to commit to her feelings a struggle that I found to be quite interesting. In the end I was glad that things worked out between them. Though the romance between the two was relatively short within the series I felt that it was also one of the sweetest as the groundwork for it was already laid when they were still young leaving the only thing that they need to do is accept the feelings and commit to it.  <br />
<br />
AMV <br />
<br />
In terms of art the character designs for the characters as well as the uniforms that they wore I felt were well designed. The town that serves as the anime’s main setting also looked pretty nice. Animation I felt was pretty clear. The series I note had pretty good music with both the scene music and the opening and ending themes being pretty good. Voice acting overall, I felt was done really well with Sayaka Kanda’s portrayal of Miharu and Rie Kugimiya’s portrayal of Mami being deserving of praise. <br />
<br />
Overall conclusion <br />
<br />
Overall Konbini Kareshi I felt was a relatively simple anime that knew what its main strengths was which in this case was its simplicity and focused on it. In my opinion Konbini’s main strength was its simple premise, interesting story and well-designed characters. The decision to make use of the months of the year as its titles for its episodes I felt was also interesting as it highlighted that high school life is fleeting and that if you don’t make a decision now you may not get the chance again. The overall story when looking at it can be seen as a series of short stories that has as its focus one of the series main pairings that were combined together into one overall plot line. Each of these parings and the romance between them I felt was done really well especially between Miharu and Haruki and Towa and Mami. The romance between Waka and Mikado though the shortest in the series was also quite sweet. The premise of using a konbini which is the Japanese term for a convenience store as the anchor point for the friendships and bonds that the six main characters forge I felt was a great idea since in Japan Konbini’s are far more common than they are in the west. Its help in allowing the romance between Miharu and Haruki I felt was especially cute. The Final Score for Konbini I feel would be a 7/10 because of its interesting premise, well-designed characters, well developed romances and excellent voice acting. This was however let down by some under developed characters and not giving a better role for some characters which ended up wasting the talents of their seiyuu. <br />

    Based off the adaptation of a drama series, I&#039;ve expected this to last a bit longer than the 1-cours that it usually has because of its character developments and whatnot. But the conversion from the screen towards anime is a lot more wayward, with 2 of the 6 main couples getting their screen time, and honestly it feels very wasted, in terms of production and time.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
If you have watched high school romance melodrama before, this should be a no-brainer. Everything sounds like it should be: Have a setting (in this case, a convenience store), and let the drama play before your eyes.<br />
The presentation of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review259051">
        drama isn&#039;t bad, but when you look at how the story progression goes, it&#039;s mundanely slow, but that&#039;s how dramas eloquently work.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
2 main couples: Haruki &amp; Miharu, Mami &amp; Towa.<br />
The others get a backseat, or cameos wherever the gaps are needed to be filled.<br />
<br />
For a drama series, character development is a vital and essential part of the whole show, because it is when they are properly given more than enough time to flesh their stories. In this case however, the couples showcased here don&#039;t give the drama justice, because as a whole, it is meant to be a filler towards the others, like all 6 couples have to be presented since you have that premise at the start, if not more so.<br />
<br />
If there&#039;s one thing to blame at, it&#039;s not the average characters, but how much went into the production of this show that makes it worthwhile to watch or not.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation:<br />
Veteran studio Pierrot has brought us so many classics before (e.g. Yu Yu Hakusho), and just recently wrapped up the yearly 4-cour Twin Star Exorcists just the season before, so to understand what went wrong here is an understatement.<br />
<br />
The art was soft and crisp, but more than enough, they didn&#039;t put in as much effort here, and to know that this is an original project, studio Pierrot knew that only specific people would love a high school romance melodrama, so the effort injected here isn&#039;t gonna amount to anything. Same goes for the animation, it&#039;s smooth and consistent, but then again, there&#039;s nothing to write off about.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
This is the only area where I feel like I have a soft spot of. Had a liking for both the OP and ED, but severely swelled at the end, because (like I said) it is meant to give the audience the feeling of watching a drama in anime form. Decent but not mediocre.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
If there&#039;s one thing to come out of this, expect watching a drama just to spare some time off the numerous troupes of shows that we&#039;ve been watching that are both bad and good, and just relax to the tune.<br />
<br />
Only recommended if you watch dramas and nothing else. Other than that, there are shows that have done this better (e.g. Nagi no Asukara, Tsuki ga Kirei) and this is unfortunately a disastrous waste of time.

    I have never written a review on an anime before but this anime is just so good that I have to.<br />
<br />
This anime just never seizes to amaze me....week after week after week it just brings the excitement and the enjoyment that just makes you addicted.<br />
<br />
Story:The story  is very good,from the very first episode you would wish you could travel a week in the future to watch the next.It is unique,interesting and has great plot.As for now it only mainly focuses on 2 couples but that will change in the future.If you are interested in Slice of Life and Romance genre I highly recommend it.I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255678">
        give it an 8/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Art:There is not much to be said about art of this anime.It is good,not great but good<br />
I give it a 7/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound:Ok as of the very first episode of the anime there was a little problem with the sound but from there on it was great.The opening and Ending themes are amazing aswell.I give it a 7/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:This anime is highly enjoyable.TRUST me you wont get bored.It just leaves you hungry for more and more episodes.It&#039;s one of the things that make this anime so good.I don&#039;t know how the writers are doing it but whatever they are doing they should keep at it because its working.Even if you aren&#039;t an anime fan you are guaranteed to still enjoy this one.I give it a 9/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Character:Other than the story and how much I enjoy this anime there is one thing that really tops both of them and that&#039;s the characters.If I had to put how I feel about the characters of this anime in one word it would be SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS............Yep.There I said it.The characters are truly one of a kind they should be up there with the &#039;slice of life greats&#039;.I truly love how they are introduced and how their personalities are and it just sets up for amazing character development.They are outstanding in my opinion. I give it an 11/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally as my last words I would like to recommend this anime to all of you anime lovers and non lovers out there.I hope you love it just as me and other fans do.It is very underrated.It is easily in the top 3 anime of this season. #MakeKonbiniKareshiKnown

    There is nothing special about this series. It starts off the same as almost every other series in this category, but quickly looses momentum and stands still where no development is really happening. It slowly picks up pace towards the end and the out come is what was expected.<br />
It does a poor job at explaining backstory and wrapping the ending up. In the end you are left wondering about 100 questions which makes it feel only half complete, as it only addresses the main questions.<br />
I enjoyed the simple artwork, although wasn&#039;t anything worth mentioning, a fairly neutral pallet which is easy on the eyes with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review259462">
        a handful of interesting backgrounds.<br />
Overall this a fairly average series, there wasn&#039;t anything that made you feel like you need more, and nothing that made you glad it was over. If you don&#039;t mind a slow paced and open ended series give this a watch. For a filler in between seasons it will satisfy the rom com needs, although this wouldn&#039;t be my first pick. This series is still a decent option for those wanting more, and just want something that will make them feel good.

    i have never written a review for an anime before. but this one was so lacking in everything that i feel the need to write one to save someone else time from watching this<br />
the title and summary are misleading. the main protag isn&#039;t even the focus of the plot most of the time and there&#039;s not even &#039;6 mains characters&#039; that it focuses on. everything was open ended and i found myself struggling to want to finish it. every episode left me so bored and uninterested. i wish this actually SHOWED romance rather than TELLING me. there was also a pointless incest couple that showed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293032">
        up for zero reason for one episode who were never metioned again. i hated everything about this show

    I&#039;m not really sure why the title is &quot;Convenience Store Boyfriends&quot; as the characters don&#039;t really hang around the convenience store very much, and none of the boys work there. So aside from the not-so-apt title, what does the show bring to the table?<br />
<br />
In short, it&#039;s a slice of life with romantic undertones anime. The characters go to school, interact with each other, many times awkwardly. The plot moves at a fairly slow pace, which is also a tad strange since they title each episode with a month. So if you&#039;re not into slow progression, this probably isn&#039;t going to be up your alley.<br />
<br />
The character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256198">
        interaction is a good draw, however. The characters do tend to fall into cliches every so often (IE: tsundere girl who isn&#039;t honest about her feelings) but it doesn&#039;t detract from how they interact.<br />
<br />
Since I enjoy slower paced, realistic themes this show comes off very well.

    First of all, that damn truck in the end got me pissed!! (If you know you know)<br />
<br />
The anime itself is not bad, Konbini Kareshi is actually very enjoyable and cozy, the relationship between the main character and his best friend is very nice to see, BUT, man... that Haruki is q wimp... JESUS, it just took too long for something to happen!! <br />
<br />
I felt like Towa was more engaged throughout the story than Haruki, they basically gave him 2 episodes ( Those being the last ones) to be himself, but that is not enough time, the ending was completely loose for me. <br />
<br />
Chasing after someone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341183">
        throughout the hole series and then A FUCKING TRUCK KILLS MY FU@@@ moment... I didn’t enjoy the ending, it was a 9/10 until that ending, and because of it, it’s a 7/10. I DONT WANT TO LEAVE THE ENDING TO MY IMAGINATION!!!! Make it real!!!<br />
<br />
But it’s not a bad show, watch it.

    Nothing special, really. Its just like other same typical romance and slice-of-life anime but its just... boring i would say but the art, visual, and graphic is decent. People would expect the story would developed around the konbini since its literally the show&#039;s name but nope. Main male characters already dull and they make the main female characters basically with no expression (there is expression, its kinda hard for me to explain this one, but you&#039;ll know what i mean), and poof just like that it ends, nothing really special happened between the couple, your reaction the entire series will be like &quot;okay&quot; thats it.<br />

    Not going to lie... I only watched this anime because I got a keychain of it from an anime loot box(It was filled with random animes). Owning merch of the show, I wanted to give it a shot. Now, let&#039;s get into the anime basics.<br />
<br />
Story; I don&#039;t know who did the Synopsis on MAL, but this anime is about 12 students, each supposed to fall in love with their person. But the main focus is on Towa Honda(the typical popular boy who annoys the girl he likes until she can&#039;t help but love him back) and Haruki Mishima(fallen in love with his childhood friend, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418838">
        doesn&#039;t &quot;know it&quot; and for reason just can&#039;t confess for the life of him). You watch them do stupid teenager shit, fall in love with their person and go to the convenience store way too often. Art; I was hoping it would get better after the first episode... it did not. Sound; The OST was pretty decent, and probably the best part of the show. Characters; Maybe it was the animation that got to me, but the characters (whether main or side) were just awkward as hell. Long pauses every god damn minute, characters just staring at each other for no reason and some scenes/reactions that just didn&#039;t seem finished.<br />
<br />
Overall, I didn&#039;t enjoy this anime. I stayed till the end hoping we&#039;d get to see the rest of the cast, but during the 12 episodes they only focused on the four main characters who were boring and dry, They had the cute guy in the kitchen, a super short girl who was paired up with a giant from student council and a librarian who loves a guy from the track &amp; field club... yet they focused on step daddy issues, family issues, guy who can&#039;t accept he loves a girl and a girl who is sweet but mysterious because of a disease.<br />
<br />
The coolest thing I found out about this anime is that an actual convenience store, Lawson&#039;s, collaborated with Kadokawa to make this... did they succeed? No...

    This is probably the only anime I watched that starts out very poorly first few episodes only to get increasingly better with each consecutive episode.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I did fast forward/skip through some parts of first three-four episodes since they seemed nauseatingly boring at times, and I had planned to drop the anime once I made sure there was nothing in it for me, but I&#039;m glad I stuck around.<br />
<br />
At start, the animation looked weird, and it remained under average through the anime. From the title alone, Konbini Kareshi, you can tell what the plot of the anime will vaguely be, however it has a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261400">
        few aces in its sleeve that will get revealed later in the story as to why it got that name. The characters started out bland, almost indistinguishable one from another, especially the male ones(they even got similar hairstyles), however they(inc. males) receive decent development afterwards. Character interactions were somewhat cringy at the beginning but later improved. Music is also surprisingly enjoyable and it fits the mood well, again, especially at later parts. I do like that they were very consistent with the fairy tale they used as a metaphor throughout.<br />
<br />
I think you get the idea and understand my first point from reading my second paragraph about what I meant. It&#039;s one of those anime that you need to grind a bit to get to the good part.<br />
<br />
For an anime that as of writing this review has only 6.34 rating, it definitely has a lower grade than it deserves. They are quite a few melodies I fancied but having trouble downloading illeg- uh... I mean, buying it, since the anime isn&#039;t very popular with barely over 30k members as of writing the review. We&#039;ll see how many it gets over time and whether the rating will, hopefully, improve.<br />
One thing I should definitely mention is if you&#039;re looking for a decent romance anime, it is satisfactory. It may not be the next Toradora, Maid-sama or Clannad, but it&#039;s definitely worth your time, in my humble opinion.

    Love seems to be the hardest thing in the world to express or to confess to someone you love that person.<br />
<br />
     story: to put it out there as this is probly one of the average mundane series that you could come across I mean it not bad and it not great either however it is one of those feel good shows. my issue is that I have a hard time with character that act cowardly or can&#039;t say what there thinking in front of someone they like. I guess in a sense this is okay do to the fact that it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295205">
        is hard to tell someone that you in love with them if you have the patience and see thing through then maybe you like it but if you don&#039;t have the patience it can be a bit of a struggle to watch through it.<br />
<br />
   character: honestly they are your everyday average teenage kids with high school dilemma which happen be about girls. I tend to enjoy Honda love life more than I do with the MC and it maybe because you do see the hardship in there relationship and how they work things out make it worth the and plus Honda is actually pretty likable character.<br />
       MC I found that his character is a bit boring for as he doesn&#039;t really try to impress nor does he push himself towards what he want rather than ran away ost of the time although his crush or I should say the girl he is in love with. you o tend to care about her a lot since she has a pretty sad backstory to her life<br />
       I can honestly say that without the MC character and the show focus ore on honda-kun I would of rate better to be above average since his story has a lot and bit more in depth so that why you may care about him more.<br />
<br />
<br />
   ART/SOUND  the art work is not really amazing per say but it is enjoyable especially I like how the character hair are drawn kinda give it a bit more of a personality and the sound like the OP is actually pretty catchy I mean you could sing along with it easy to dance to I say. but the series musical is a bit drawn out and ruins some part of the show but again that is opinion base.<br />
<br />
<br />
   overall  I did enjoy watching for as it is average.  I feel that they could had add a bit more drama to it to make the ball going a little faster or at least make it a bit more interesting rather than watching it as like something like you would see in a play. the ending could of been better like make more meaningful rather than acting like it was no big deal I mean I wouldn&#039;t if a love story ended up with a guy running to the airport and confessing his love but ya here they made it look like it was nothing special but yet still ge the message across. if your the type that like a good love story that could potential happen in real life and I can say that I could this actually happen to someone sense it give it a bit a realize idea other than that it would be something to watch if you have nothing better thing to do.

    I had low expectations from this anime given its score but was somehow still let down. This is typical high school romance anime, which in itself isn’t bad, but the issue is very little happens in 12 episodes and you find yourself falling asleep every so often. Still, it’s not complete garbage. <br />
<br />
Let’s start with the good points. The art and scenery are absolutely beautiful, which gives the anime a very relaxing feel. The animation is clearly cheap and full of still moments but I don’t mind it as much because I have even watched copic animation before, as long as art and story is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330840">
        good, I can forgive this type of animation. Sound was great and pretty much all characters were likeable to at least some degree except the lead couple.<br />
<br />
Now this is where the problem begins. I don’t think I have ever seen a character as gyrating on nerves as Haruki. He is as likeable as the sound of chalk screeching on black board. This guy along with his chick are dunce couple no 1 of the show. Towards the end of the show at least the girl redeems herself by showing some complex emotions but Haruki  remains a cardboard cutout until the very end. He is supposedly in love with this girl since childhood but one thousand opportunities later he still hasn’t proposed to her even when the girl is dropping all the hints. This would be fine for couple of episodes but literally an entire series based on this is overkill. I feel like if Haruki didn’t exist or get so much screen time, this show would have scored two more points. Only saving grace were Towa and his taicho, who also follow a very used formula of outgoing popular guy falls for uncutesy loner, but despite the boring trope they were enjoyable to watch.<br />
<br />
I can’t really recommend this anime but I don’t hate it either. It’s a fairly average time pass with some great eye catching scenery and some cute moments and that’s about it.

    Honestly, the first few episodes were pretty okay. We see a lot of different guys and girls with different personalities hanging out at the one school they all go to. HOWEVER, since this is an anime adaptation of a drama CD series, we should be expecting some downsizing to fit the typical 12 episode slice of life anime. I honestly thought they&#039;d just divide the show up for each of the couples so we can see the storyline for each pair to grow. But they pretty much just focused the entire show on the four first years, and that kind of ticks me off. By

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257601">
        all means, if they wanna make time for the other characters, they should just expand the series more so we can get more spotlight on the couples whom we haven&#039;t seen develop that much yet. Aside from some pairings that weren&#039;t the first years, the others have had zero to little interaction with each other.

    Konibini Kareshi seems quite outwardly to be a pretty cliche adaptation of a manga that just missed its mark. Nothing really stands out other than a few express moments, and I found myself not even paying attention for long spans. Not only that but three episodes in, I realized I didn&#039;t even know the characters names. I feel like this could have been a great romance show, but because of how it was directed, everything comes off so weird and out of place. Every shot seemed kinda lazy and lingered a bit too long, and the characters were so confused, the writing made no sense.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257525">
        Needless to say, there was at least one moment where I actually laughed genuinely because of how out of place the humor was and it was too perfect. I think some people could enjoy this show, but it failed to keep me glued to the screen long enough to remember the main characters names. And that is why I can&#039;t enjoy it.

    Convenience Store Boyfriends claims to revolve around six guys who meet their crushes at the convenience store, but the actual show itself doesn’t heavily involve the convenience store, nor does it equally focus on the six guys they introduce. Instead, this anime chooses to focus on two of the relationships and their evolution over the course of their first year of high school.<br />
<br />
Story: The premise of a slice-of-life revolving around a convenience store is interesting. Even if the convenience store does not show up in many scenes, it still serves as a symbol of stability amongst the four main characters. They meet up, talk, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316331">
        make plans at the convenience store, which leads to the core of the simple slice-of-life story.<br />
<br />
Characters: The characters seemed bland at first, but they grew to be rather realistic. As high schoolers trying to balance their academic and social life, the characters are bound to make mistakes. After all, they’re confused, conflicted, and maybe even scared. Along the way, the characters learn to be honest with themselves. While the characters are not unique in terms of personality, they embody honesty and compassion.<br />
<br />
Art: I actually found this anime because I saw Senzaki Makoto’s original character designs. I felt that the anime found a good middle ground between the original artstyle and a more versatile one for animating. The characters are not stunningly attractive, but I think they are appealing enough. As for the animation, I couldn’t gauge whether it was good or bad. At times, the animation looks choppy or off for some reason (Asumi running in the opening). Other times, the animation is beautiful when it comes to the landscape or to close-ups (scenes with the bridge come to mind). It’s not the best animation out there, but it shouldn’t deter anyone interested from watching. If anything, some of the expressions on background characters are pretty funny.<br />
<br />
Execution: Convenience Store Boyfriends is an anime original based loosely around mooks (magazine books) and drama CDs. As such, it was probably a risk to create such a large scale project around a story that no one has heard about. While the monthly approach to the episodes was a fun idea, I thought that it would have worked better as light novels. In 12 episodes, I believe the anime would have benefited from a slower flow of time. The story itself is interesting, but the pacing and writing could be improved upon.<br />
<br />
Overall, I rather enjoyed the show despite its flaws. It’s a rather simple slice-of-life, but it is full of compassion. I would watch a second season, but I also feel a revamp of the storyline would be a better course of action, especially to give the side characters a greater role and more character development.<br />

    *it may be a little bit confusing*<br />
<br />
the anime give you a lot of promise in the after credit.. like how they tell you a start of bla..bla...bla. *can`t care less*<br />
<br />
as the synopsis and the opening .. the anime is about six couple that are connected with a convenience store *yeah this is weird*<br />
<br />
but the problem with the anime here.. the lack of episode *it only 12 ep and no special or ova whatsoever* just by this point u might be thinking how can they fit 6 couple on the whole god damn 12 ep..<br />
<br />
*spoiler ahead*<br />
<br />
Story=the mc story are pretty good on its own way ..

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303723">
        but my main problem with the story is how they dont even care about the other character at all.. aside from the mc best friend that for me i cant even care at all... its really boring.. not that i say its that boring .. it have its own interesting story about popular guy and geek girl ...typical shojo manga...other than that..there are another story about family love *you know brother love his own sister* i dont really understand this story cause of how bad they explain the character relationship..and that all ... yeah only three couple and no more .. the other character are not absent in the anime but that all .. the other character are almost like a background character that only there to set the mood for the main char in the story *eventhough they are main char too* dont get me wrong..the real story that related with the mc are pretty damn good with a plot twist that make my head go so crazy and amuse me at  the same  time... it was really good and i think some of you will really enjoy that story.<br />
<br />
Art=i got some trouble with this thing... as the anime progress the art goes beyond u can aspect how bad the art can be..it goes bad as the ep progress you almost can see the different from the first ep..the REAL art of this anime are kinda pretty and u can really enjoy it.. but they only make a proper art with the mc story .. other than that? it just  a mess... the anime can get a better score if they keep the art that they display on the first ep..<br />
<br />
Sound=kinda like it.. the opening is really awesome and it can cause u to sing along without notice it.. and the ending also somthing to look forward too..<br />
<br />
Character=the dev of the char was pretty bad if you ask me..its boring and only some of the character you can actually take interest in..*probably if you watch the anime you will like the mc* because the other character was a little bit lack of something that can make you like the char..<br />
<br />
My Opinion= if you dont have any anime to watch with romance tag .. this anime is dont really worth your time..but try to watch it and see yourself did you like it or not..they are much more anime with the same genre that are much better than this but trying did not  kill people right...??<br />
<br />
i have make some research about it and it seem like the anime will get a second season .. maybe in that season it will give us a bright light about the other character.. and maybe the second season will be much better than the first one.. but we can just wait for now.. <br />

    This high-school anime is much more like a drama, which may be refreshing if you&#039;re tired of light novel adaptions. A light, youthful love story is portrayed in a very quiet, low key fashion, without outlandish events, fanservice, or the humour that fills real slice of life shows. Howa and Mami&#039;s growing relationship is earnest, at times very touching, and exceptionally believable, but sadly not portrayed with much nuance, or originality in the direction. Character types are clear and distinct, but development is slow and shallow. A &#039;realistic&#039; drama needs much deeper and more original insight into the real world, or it becomes simply flat

        and uninteresting.<br />
<br />
Note that I restricted my critique to Blondie and the Class Rep; 2/3rds into the series, this has NOT been the ensemble show the opening suggests. Ep 7 prodded a secondary couple through an offensive and appalling piece of soap opera. The &#039;main character&#039; and the Nice Girl have drifted through an uninspired procession of would-be-cute moments, without making a fraction of the progress Blondie and Class Rep make in a single episode. Without good music, cinematography, original characterisation or writing to suggest romantic tension, it&#039;s a little sweet, but boring and forgettable. Although the opening song is quite good, the animation is very cheap and the other music, as mentioned, is uninspired.

    I don&#039;t know why this show is so underrated. Currently keeping up with this series and I&#039;d easily give a 7 out of 10 in overall.<br />
<br />
Story: A typical Slice of Life/Romance anime with the high school students theme, the series basically revolves around 2 couples, which is okay I assume. There are still clichés, but in an acceptable amount. <br />
<br />
Art: Studio Pierrot never ceases to disappont me when talking about their arts. They&#039;ve been screwing up since Naruto and the tradition continues here in Konbini Kareshi. The characters look fine in overall, but in some close-up scenes the lack of details and/or the poor animation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256771">
        really make this anime less enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Character: Probably the best thing about this series. The development is kind of natural. They develop their feelings throughout the series in a normal way. Drama did take place, but no mindblowing plot twists, or unreasonable- unexpected events. Plot holes still exist, but not that many to ruin the story.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Totally enjoyable, as expected from a Slice of Life anime.<br />
<br />
This is my first review, feel free to discuss about it.<br />
