    Tomozaki is cringe-worthy; both the anime and the character. <br />
<br />
He lacks self-confidence, cannot understand social cues, has no self-awareness, and has given up trying to make life better. He&#039;s an arrogant high-school student who disdains the rules of society without intentionally breaking them. He dresses poorly, doesn&#039;t style his hair, slouches over, and can barely hold a conversation with classmates. That makes him the ideal protagonist for an anime that understands the rules of high-school romantic comedies—and it knows how to break them. An arrogant, but earnest, speech introduces Tomozaki. <br />
<br />
&quot;Life is a god-tier game… But from where I stand, that&#039;s bullshit. You get discriminated

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386918">
        against or treated poorly for your face, your build, your age. All these absurd rules go unchallenged. Unreasonable and unbalanced. That&#039;s what life is. &#039;That&#039;s only because you&#039;re not trying!&#039; Biased thinking from someone born as a top-tier character. Some noob gamer born lucky enough to enjoy blazing through life on easy mode doesn&#039;t get to talk about life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The game of life is garbage.&quot;<br />
<br />
When I read this, I cringed out of my skin, and I assumed Tomozaki would be another annoying self-centered anime protagonist who&#039;d get everything he wanted with no effort. Things didn&#039;t quite go the way I expected. Everyone goes through a phase in life where you feel like the world has wronged you. And that&#039;s because it has. People born into a family with high income will have a much easier life than someone born into poverty—the world is unfair, and that&#039;s a fact. Tomozaki mistakenly believes he was born in an unfortunate situation. He selfishly assumed he was the only kid in his high school who has been created by society. But as his newfound rival Hinami says, &quot;You lost, and you&#039;re blaming the game.&quot; She takes it upon herself to train him to become better at the game of life, which involves fixing his shitty personality. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s a precise goal of Bottom-tier Character Tomozaki-kun: Turn a self-centered loser into an average joe, and I loved to watch it unfold. Tomozaki doesn&#039;t fit in with other high school students. No one understands him. He has trouble making friends in the real world, so he ends up spending most of his time playing games. It&#039;s not all bad though, he enjoys honing his skills and fighting his in-game rival. But there&#039;s more to life.<br />
<br />
At first glance, it may seem like the story reaffirms Tomozaki&#039;s weird way of judging people—like your typical harem fantasy isekai—but his quick judgments get proven wrong. Though he acts like he&#039;s just telling it like it is, he&#039;s an outcast because of his quick judgment. He believes he can see through everyone&#039;s actions, and they&#039;re the problem—like a sociologist. The truth is, he&#039;s the problem. Hinami believes the key to his success is by teaching him strategies to fool people into liking him. Same as Tomozaki, she thinks she is the most intelligent person in the room. One of Hinami&#039;s challenges that will raise Tomozaki&#039;s statistics is to publicly embarrass the &#039;cool guys&#039; in his class. AKA, being an asshole and saying things like:<br />
<br />
&quot;Your dick is tiny!&quot; <br />
<br />
*cue laughter*<br />
<br />
It would’ve been funny if I hadn’t heard these jokes in middle school. The comedy is hit or miss, but there’s more success in terms of the characters. Through Hinami’s games, the author explores mistakes kids make when attempting to fit in. Every time Hinami gives Tomozaki instructions on the next &#039;level&#039; of the game, he seems uncomfortable. He remarks how dating a girl to increase his social status doesn&#039;t feel sincere. I liked seeing Tomozaki slowly realize his mistakes. Hinami&#039;s complicated personality unravels as Tomozaki becomes more self-aware. She&#039;s the closest thing the anime has to a villain. Seeing him try, fail, and eventually succeed entertains her in an almost sadistic way. She orders him to have better posture, practice smiling, and even get a girlfriend of her choosing. These are supposed to make him a better member of society—and objectively some of her advice is helpful, but other times it is outright manipulative. Though you may interpret her lessons as the author&#039;s message, he does not condone Hinami&#039;s antagonistic behavior. Their cat-and-mouse relationship is more frustrating than exciting because the pay-off comes far too late. The author has the workings of a great story in his hands, but he lacks the tools to craft it.<br />
<br />
Hinami idolized Tomozaki because he&#039;s a talented player in her favorite game, but she also looks down on him for failing at the game of life. He can&#039;t dress himself properly; his hair looks like a mess, his posture is terrible. Everything she says about him is absolutely valid—though she says it is a cruel and demeaning way. Rather than trying to inspire him, she more often seems like she wants to put him down. She&#039;s frustrated that he can&#039;t do simple tasks to fit in and instead blames society because she knows it&#039;s hard, yet she put in the effort to fit in. She experiences a kind of schadenfreude when witnessing Tomozaki&#039;s failures. When Tomozaki breaks the rules of her game and confronts her with the truth that she&#039;s unhappy with her fake personality, it makes raw and believable moments. I wish these scenes weren&#039;t limited to the final act.<br />
<br />
This is Tomozaki-kun at its best—when it isn&#039;t afraid to be down-to-earth. The script alternates between genuinely witty touches and standard rom-com dialogue with drama woven in. Weighing down the script the most is the &#039;gamer lingo.&#039; If you see the word &quot;Noob&quot; or &quot;Normie&quot; and feel compelled to claw your eyes out, I don&#039;t blame you, but you won’t like this show. The dialogue sometimes feels like it was written by someone&#039;s out-of-touch dad trying to talk to his kids. Without the great voice performances on the part of the two leads, it would&#039;ve lost me. The show&#039;s production enhances the script&#039;s delivery overall. The character designs are good. The artists nail certain facial expressions and subtle changes, but overall there isn&#039;t much animation. Most of the show takes place in similar locations: A classroom, a cafe, a sidewalk, and stores. There&#039;s no need for spectacular animation because it&#039;s all talking and monologuing. I&#039;m sure that will be an instant turn-off for some people. The sound design is much more appreciable. Songs aren&#039;t faded into each other—they stop and start at pivotal moments. The songs are decent; both the OP and ED are good.<br />
<br />
Bottom-tier Character often straddles the line between condoning or condemning Tomozaki&#039;s bizarre behavior. But more often than not, it falls on the &#039;condemning&#039; side. He monologues in a logical manner, psychoanalyzing his classmates&#039; behavior. One of his creepiest lines was commenting on a mutual friend who arrives a little late to a meetup; he says, &quot;This ditzy act absolves you of a myriad of sins.&quot; Dude, she was like 5 seconds late. No one wants to hang out with someone who psychoanalyzes everything they do. That&#039;s why Tomozaki is at his happiest when he deviates from Hinami&#039;s rules—and the rules of the rom-com genre.<br />
<br />
Hinami compares their female classmates to heroines in a dating simulator—you go out on dates with a love interest. It&#039;s dehumanizing but expected of her personality. Then after enough successful interactions, they become your girlfriend. Tomozaki adopts this dating sim method because Hinami told him to—it shouldn&#039;t work because real people are nothing like shallow characters in a game. Luckily, the author realized this and subverted the script. Rather than getting the girl with his gamer strategies, he throws them out the windows and just acts like himself. It works. Genuine people don&#039;t like fakers, and that&#039;s what Tomozaki is about. Between the wit and fanservice, the characters scarcely have room to breathe. Luckily, they were sure to spare at least half an episode to delve into each of the troubled side characters: Feelings of inadequacy, troublesome romance, or struggles to fit in. Tomozaki takes the time to get to know everyone while attempting to raise his stats. He comes to realize everyone has a tough life, even more than him, and that he isn&#039;t unique.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the excessive fan service makes the subversive character writing feel somewhat phony. Thigh shots, unnecessary nudity, leering panning shots, and the girls grope each other for the audience&#039;s entertainment. One could argue there are&#039; story reasons&#039; for why there is so much sexualization, but let&#039;s be honest, folks. This is a product, and it needs to make money, regardless if it undermines the show&#039;s themes. <br />
<br />
Mimimi is an excellent example of a side character with a compelling story, undermined by fetishization. She is one of Tomozaki&#039;s potential love interests and a friend of Hinami, the object of her inferiority complex. However, she has a knack for sexually harassing her friend Tama. The show plainly tells us her story, &quot;Her feelings for Hinami—a mix of gratitude, respect, and envy—have mellowed out a bit thanks to Tama. Though Mimimi&#039;s sexual harassment seems to have increased threefold.&quot; The first part is solid character writing; however, the second part isn&#039;t. Mimimi acknowledges what she does is harmful to an extent, yet she continues to do it. Even after her character arc completes, the happy ending feels undeserved. Unlike Tomozaki, she never realizes that she&#039;s creepy and works to improve it. This probably won&#039;t be a problem for everyone, but it was for me. <br />
<br />
Eventually, Tomozaki surpasses Hinami in the proverbial game of life once he realizes there is no game. Life is what it is, and attempting to climb an invisible social ladder won&#039;t make you a happier person. I recognize Tomozaki-kun is made for people five years younger than me, but I still enjoyed it. For that reason, recommend it to anyone around 16 years old. It&#039;s not a challenging show to watch if you&#039;re familiar with subversive romantic comedies; It is comfortable. Though it is far from perfect, it tells a universally relevant message: Be yourself.

    I want to iterate this before all else being it’s important: This is not nearly as gimmicky as the synopsis puts it. Not only is it arguably one of the most fascinating and culturally relevant anime that has aired in the last decade or so, but it’s a show that contains genuine character exploration and growth. <br />
<br />
I can’t blame you for thinking that sounds impossible based on the surface level display this show gives off. Though it’s simplistic and very much adapted from a light novel, it’s fully aware of both its audience and the landscape of anime similar to it. It demonstrably stresses the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386903">
        importance of self-improvement, but primarily it&#039;s biting against irrational subconscious anti-social mindsets that cause people anguish.<br />
<br />
Fittingly to this narrative, Jaku-chara Tomozaki-kun opens with a scene that can easily be interpreted as generic and a meaningless interpretation of a gamer, but in actuality is one half of communicating the entire message of the show. Tomozaki is ranked 1 in TackFam, the universe’s depiction of a popular fighting game. Up against Nakumura, a regular classmate of his and someone far beneath his skill level, he easily destroys him. But Nakumura is arrogant, he blames the game, the characters. He resorts to blaming the matchups. Tomozaki proves it&#039;s a matter of skill, talent, and effort. He beats him even with the worst of matchups. A low level Marth player would still get destroyed by a top level Fox on FD, to put it into Smash Bros. terms, the game TackFam is based on. Tomozaki takes pride in his devotion to the game, and won’t accept baseless slander from someone who hasn’t put in the work he has. When we contrast this to the other half of the basis of the show: Tomozaki’s first interaction with Hinami, we become aware of what the major focal point actually is. When it comes to “real life”, Tomozaki is Nakumura in TackFam. He blames others for his own personal woes. (The ‘characters’) He believes there is a sort of social hierarchy he can’t break free from (The ‘game’), and that some people are just born better than others.(The ‘matchups’) It’s the exact same whiny and arrogant point of view he himself rebuked being directed towards TackFam. It’s blaming others when it&#039;s your own lack of effort that has you in the position you are. Why can’t it be any different when it comes to reality? Tomozaki is proven hypocritical.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake—this isn’t just about someone growing into a socially viable person, it&#039;s a show that’s directly criticizing the type of self-loathing and presumptuous belief that it’s others—<br />
not you— culture that anime itself tends to glorify and coddle those with a similar mindset. This was remarkable, and as a devout anime and light novel adaptation consumer, I was legitimately shocked that a show like this could exist in the climate of modern anime.<br />
<br />
Even though I was already sold after the first episode, the show continues forward with a main character who receives proper development, and a cast of side characters who are used to explore other plaguing mindsets. If it isn&#039;t already clear by now, this is more of a character driven drama rather than a rom-com with hyperbolic tropes of a gamer and normie popular kids.<br />
<br />
Tomozaki is directed down a path of social improvement by Hinami. This isn’t just basic advice, however. It&#039;s a decisive strategic motion to make friends and create interest in oneself. Easily said, the key to getting to know people is by showing interest in them or their surroundings. People won’t care about you if you don’t care about them. Yuzu likes Nakumura? Help her find ways to appeal to him. Mimimi wants to run for student council? Ask her if you can support her bid. Let people in, share secrets with them, gain their trust and become someone they can rely on. Fuuka likes a certain author? Read their books. When a time comes where you can ask her out to see a movie adaptation of the same author, you have both an excuse and are giving the other party respect by showing admiration to their interests. It’s physical improvements as well. Get a haircut. Stand up straight. Speak louder and stop looking so grim. Take care of your appearance and dress well. This show talks the talk and walks the walk. <br />
<br />
Of course, it can sound problematic to see interest in people as “goals” or for your own sake rather than by genuine curiosity and the desire to get to know someone, but the show has answers to this. Gradually throughout, Tomozaki gains his own agency. He realizes that being himself makes the other person more comfortable. Perhaps it was only through deliberate effort and a push from the back that Tomozaki was able to form relationships, but eventually he grows past the need to seek orders. He changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
The side characters are real people, not bloated tropes. Anime has a tendency to demonize “popular kids” and make them one dimensional bullies solely for the main characters to ultimately dunk on. I can assure you that with the exception of one single character in one scene, none of the characters in this show are like that at all. Yuzu, Mimimi, Takahiro, and Nakumura are vulnerable in some way. Deconstructing what commonly “popular characters” appear as in anime in a show like this seems even more important when it’s all about demonstrating the importance of having and maintaining relationships. As showing what would be the formidable unapproachable characters in other shows as real people, it’s encouraging and a reminder that we are not so different. <br />
<br />
Frequently I was struck at how overwhelmingly positive the show could get. Tomozaki would relish in and internalize his growth. He described the feelings of successful social interactions as “primal” like a necessary need. He grows if only a little bit each and every episode. It’s fun watching him gain the trust of others. It’s heartwarming seeing others take interest in him and care for him. He quickly becomes someone you can route for and support.<br />
<br />
It’s a rarity of a show. It manages to be mindfully indulgent, bold, and have meaning. And even if it&#039;s not as well-written as other more culturally influential anime, it’s accessibility and ease of entry may give someone what they really need.<br />

    This review will be updated as the episodes go on&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I still don&#039;t understand some people out there saying that Tomozaki is complete rubbish,<br />
The anime may not please everyone, but it is far from it and not to mention that it does what it proposes.<br />
<br />
I wasn&#039;t thinking of writing a review about the anime, but with those four episodes I think I can talk about what I think for now.<br />
<br />
Well, the anime has a lot of female characters and this is kind of worrying, to be honest working with a large cast is kind of difficult for the characters to talk a lot, all that remains

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376347">
        to do is wait. what will happen in the next episodes. I particularly like the dialogues between the characters and not to mention the interaction they have.<br />
<br />
Aoi is one of the strongest points of the work and seeing her putting the protagonist in embarrassing situations is fun.<br />
<br />
The animation of the anime is very good and from what I saw in the illustrations of the original material the animation was really very good

    Story:5<br />
From what I&#039;ve seen its just a standard romance about a gamer boy who meets a gamer girl and she helps him become a functioning member of society and get a girlfriend<br />
<br />
Art:4<br />
Its pretty meh, the mc looks like a hentai protag<br />
<br />
Sound:5<br />
Didn&#039;t stand out in either a good or bad way<br />
<br />
Character:1<br />
The usage of Gamer and Normie and the overall reddit talk made this show practically unwatchable, anything the mc says is so cringe that you literally have to pause the show and look in the mirror and think about why you are actually doing this to yourself, this obviously also means that...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:1<br />
Its just painful to watch,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376350">
        nothing more to say, just pain<br />
<br />
Overall:1<br />
If you unironically go on gamer subreddits this anime is probably for you however if you are a functioning member of society, please stay away from this show<br />

    Life is nothing but just a game. A game of life that is! Every decision you make will affect what&#039;s going on around you, especially your classmates.<br />
<br />
Tomozaki Fumiya, our main MC here suprisingly is the best gamer in the popular online game &quot;Tackfam&quot;. Despite that, he is actually the bottomless-tier character when it comes to socializing. Lacking social skills and also have a slightly unkempt appearance. Then later meet Aoi Hinami who is a god-tier character, an opposite to Tomozaki-kun. With her social skills, Tomozaki-kun embarks on a journey to become a top-tier character in the game of life. <br />
<br />
Throughout the episodes, you&#039;ll noticed Tomozaki-kun

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386914">
        gradually changing from being an introvert and become better in socializing as he meet new characters especially an energetic and popular girl named Minami Nanami. The story doesn&#039;t appeared to be rushed so that&#039;s a plus one for me. <br />
<br />
The animation in the anime is great overall. Especially it gives several visualisation of the situations Tomozaki-kun is facing and also whenever Aoi Hinami is giving illustration of the situations. <br />
<br />
Overall, the anime has a lot of pointers on the social situations happening around us. It has a lot of things for us to learn in the anime. And as a drama anime, it has done really well and very enjoyable so far. If this is the type of anime you enjoy, feel free to watch it and follow Tomozaki-kun&#039;s journey to become a top-tier character.

    Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun is a prime example of why you should never drop an anime based on the first episode. Each episode actually gets better and better throughout. It&#039;s one of those anime that really knows how to start badly and knows how to climb to the top spot and gain more popularity, and it&#039;s all because of the story. The first episode has been seen as unappealing for the public, but for me, it is appealing as I believe that great character developments can start from the shittiest, worthless, and cringe type of character. You can call this anime as &quot;Character Development The Animation: Gamer

Story Review: <br />
<br />
Basically, the anime has been about correlating and a little bit of differentiating video games and life, along with improving your social skills and profile in life and transitioning from a loner and reject life to a normie, lively, and fun life. It&#039;s an anime that uses life coaching as the plot with video games as a theme. The story manages to point out how video games and life are the same and in what ways can you get better at life in an accurate and detailed way, and often uses gaming terminologies such as XP, Character, Level, Tasks, Objectives, and etc. in its narration. In this anime, our main man Tomozaki vows to try this game of life and do whatever it takes to beat it with the guidance of Hinami while balancing tackfam, school life, social life, and the objectives set by the game. The reason behind his willingness is because Tomozaki is a gamer, and like most gamers, they intend to beat any game that they want to. Throughout the story, it has been mostly character development and what makes it interesting is how the anime uses a gaming-themed life coaching as a plot and &quot;hook device&quot; very effectively. It does so by making life coaching become so present and very detailed in each episode. A thing that I like about the anime is how attractive the plot is (for me). It&#039;s like you know much about life, but you never put it in a gaming perspective. Another thing is how the plot, theme, and story complements the drama genre. It objectively fits so well because good dramas tend to lean into understanding which has been the focus of the anime: understanding life better but in gaming edition. Plus, life coaching as entertainment leans towards understanding and would include some drama and romance. What separates the anime from other life coaching entertainment is the gamer theme and the concept of shifting an unsociable life to a lively one. Other than that, we get to see the usual school and social life where Tomozaki encounters other students, creates relationships with them, and learns about them more (in interests, backgrounds, etc.) and their struggles in life. These two things also add normal drama and romance to the series, and it wasn&#039;t excessive and was used to widen the anime a bit more, rather than keeping it narrow to Tomozaki&#039;s character development only so that the audience can explore the anime more. <br />
<br />
The downside of the story is that the anime tends to keep things rushed, especially things that don&#039;t involve in Tomozaki&#039;s development. It&#039;s like the anime shows a task and then proceeds to show the progress of a task and then show the result, and rush anything else and I see it as a hindrance in widening the anime. The story tries to widen the anime more by adding the usual school and social life, but it really likes to narrow the anime to Tomozaki&#039;s character development. Although, there are people who are fine with the story being narrowed to character development and it&#039;s not bad at all if that&#039;s the delivery route that the anime is taking and observingly, it&#039;s what makes the anime appealing. Another downside is that it has cringe moments, but they aren&#039;t cringe for nothing. They have a meaning to the cringe moments, and it takes understanding to hold the cringeworthy scenes. Do I think cringe moments or scenes are bad? It depends on what I&#039;m watching. <br />
<br />
Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun is one of those anime that its story is worth learning from. I have seen people in social media admitting that they are taking down notes of everything that the story teaches. If you&#039;re someone who is a complete introvert, who is willing to break out of his/her shell, or someone who has very bad social skills, then this anime is for you so start taking out your notebook and ballpen and write everything that this anime has to teach. So why not give it a try?<br />
<br />

Characters Review: <br />
<br />
Tomozaki is one of those characters that looks lonely and a reject with philosophies of his own but what makes him great is how he developed in the anime. He was open to changing his way of living which became a key factor on making each episode better and better. From living like a loner to embracing a normie and fun life, it&#039;s up to you whether Tomozaki would be a respectable person because for me, he is. Hinami is one of those people that you can just admire and respect when it comes to learning about social skills. She is also a key factor in making each episode better as she takes advantage of Tomozaki&#039;s willingness to get better at life. These two characters formulate the story and the progress, and makes it very good along with minor/supporting characters that really supports the story and the presence of Tomozaki and Hinami very well. Might as well talk about other characters. We have Nanami who is an energetic and lively girl, Kikuchi who is a cute and silent girl, Izumi who is one of those open-minded girls, Mizusawa who is like a male version of Hinami, and more. Pretty much most of the supporting characters have a substance to themselves that makes a life-coaching story better.<br />

Art and Animation Review: <br />
<br />
As for the art and animation, it has been flat good. Just good art and animation with a good amount of effort exerted into it. It&#039;s not flashy or unique but rather, it&#039;s just simple. It&#039;s like a schoolwork that you put in average effort with the product being flat good. It doesn&#039;t hurt anyone&#039;s eyes and that&#039;s for sure. Though I wish it was the same as the ones in its Light Novels. There is still room for improvement though, but seeing that Project No.9 is the studio, I can&#039;t set my expectations high if they try to improve the art and animation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds Review: <br />
<br />
The voice acting was good. The seiyuus really did put a good amount of effort. It was reflective on the characters&#039; personality and it suited the characters really well. It doesn&#039;t hurt anyone&#039;s ears and that&#039;s for sure. It&#039;s the similar case to the art and animation, there is still room for improvement, but I rate the sounds higher than the art and animation. Also, I hope Takei&#039;s seiyuu improves because the voice acting just sounds so unnatural and forced.<br />
<br />
<br />
My Thoughts: <br />
<br />
It didn&#039;t get any hype and it just crawled it&#039;s way to popularity in social media anime pages. The anime started with a 6.95 rating which was very understandable considering that it knew how to start off badly. The likes of Hachiman of SNAFU long title and Oreki of Hyouka garnered a lot of attention because of how they are and since Tomozaki is similar to them in a way, the anime should continue to gain more popularity. It would be really bad if it doesn’t get a season 2. Would I watch more of this? Yes. Would I watch a season of 2? Definitely. Would this be a good recommendation to people who would want to start watching anime? Definitely and it&#039;s an anime that can set good expectations about anime to people who are new to anime. Would I rate it more than an 8? No, objectively I cannot. This is an anime that deserves a 7.4 ~ 7.8 scoreline in my opinion.

    It’s not bad...but it’s not good.<br />
<br />
If I’m being honest this anime is a repetitive idea that surrounds the use of my twin otaku, Fumiya Tomozaki’s, ability to be so iconically similar to every other otaku that has social difficulties. Even with all of that this was probably one of the animes this season I really liked for some odd reason<br />
<br />
The animation is overall better than average with smooth and clear visuals. It can show all the otaku features that I can relate to, I can see my ugly face through the screen in essentially 4k resolution with amazing visuals.<br />
<br />
The characters are a textbook bland cast.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376292">
        The main two characters are Aoi Hinami and Fumiya Tomozaki. <br />
<br />
Aoi Hinami is a by the book tsundere and is very similar to Chizuru from Rent-a-Girl-Friend. She makes an effort to make our MC into a proper person and become more sociable. This doesn’t mean she is a bad character, she gives all the qualities one would want in a tsundere and makes the show a little bit more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Our struggling reflection of ourselves is Fumiya Tomozaki, who is that classic outcast and otaku MC next to the window to the right of the classroom. He reluctantly listens to Aoi and creates an effort for a better him and slowly over time has major character developments.<br />
<br />
These characters if I’m being honest are two textbook characters that complement each other and create a very average cast of characters, much like the rest of the cast in the anime. <br />
<br />
The story as you probably interpreted is simply how long will it take Aoi to confess or something like that. In all seriousness, our story revolves around Aoi making Fumiya a better and more sociable person. I’m probably watching this because I am fervently waiting for our boy to be an absolute CHAD. Maybe it is the fact this story has been used so many times with so many takes that I have finally grown fond of it. <br />
<br />
The sounds are as you expect of an anime of this sort-average. The OP and ED are alright and have no positive or negative impact on the overall show. The soundtrack uses essentially basic sounds and there is nothing majorly notable. <br />
<br />
Ah, the enjoyment. I, for some reason, really looked forward to this show. The anime itself is executed well and created some laughs and cringe moments to enjoy. I might have a bad tendency to over-love shows that aren&#039;t special and aren&#039;t well known. This anime isn’t bad but it isn’t good, but I believe you will enjoy this show if you watch it, which you should. <br />
<br />
Overall: This anime isn’t special, it isn’t great, but it’s fun. <br />
<br />
Animation: 8<br />
Characters:5<br />
Story:4<br />
Sound: 5<br />
Enjoyment:8<br />
Overall: 7<br />

    After a very very cringe-worthy first episode of an anime I almost dropped, I present to you the underrated anime of the season. An anime that focuses on a loner that tries his best to overcome everything and actually enjoy his life. <br />
<br />
With the first episode being as bad as it is, I&#039;m very surprised to see how great this anime has been. The idea of character development that I thought I would never see specially with how things were magically solved in the first episode, turned out to be a focal point of the anime. <br />
<br />
We start with our MC Tomozaki. A loner and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386926">
        awkward person with only 1 gift of trying his best at anything he does. He meets Aoi who tries to help him &quot;win the game of life&quot;. As such, she starts telling him what to do and giving him tasks he needs to complete no matter how tough it gets. <br />
<br />
The anime&#039;s main idea was to keep things real. The main character doesn&#039;t completely change up to a chad suddenly. He is graduly becoming better while still keeping the same awkwardness albeit to a lesser degree. The anime focuses on the side characters and how the mc tries to overcome his challenges by making friends and being a better person. <br />
But there is the idea of a fake win in the background. The whole time, the MC is always thinking if what he is doing and the interactions/relationships he has with others are genuine. Thinking if everything is just a facade and that it&#039;s not him who the others are starting to enjoy spending time with but a fake persona. <br />
<br />
That idea is a very heavy one and something I didn&#039;t expect going into this anime. The characters feel more real and the interactions are used to focus on them and shed a light on that idea. No one is perfect in the anime, even the most perfect girl could be described as the most flawed one. <br />
<br />
The anime dives into some deeper ideas like unjustified hate/jealousy and focuses more into what the characters are thinking and how they feel. I could go as far as saying that I found more character depth and development to the here than the final season of Yahari for example. It was just that good. <br />
<br />
I also loved the focus on the relationships between the characters and how they seem to build over time. The relationship between Minami and Hinami was probably my favorite specially with the very realistic and heavy take on how it was presented. <br />
<br />
On a short note tho: some of the advices being given were legit just good in general so that was good. <br />
<br />
Aside from the first episode and the bath scenes in that one episode, the show kept a very good realistic approach to everything and showed enough interesting plot points to make me really like both the story and the characters. <br />
<br />
The art, animation, sounds were very well-made and the directing was good. The voice actors did a great job as well specially Gen Satou as he did a perfect job of presenting Tomozaki. <br />
<br />
Overall, I would give it an 8/10. A surprisingly good anime which may have lost on popularity due to a very bad first episode. <br />
Would recommend it.

    I was pretty surprised to see this having a very low score, seeing as it&#039;s one of the good ones this season, so I had to write a review for it.<br />
<br />
The low score is understandable since this show is a cringe-fest (in a good way) for most people watching it, because the show is all about a protagonist who is a top Tackfam gamer, but at the same time seemingly gave up on the &quot;game&quot; called life. <br />
<br />
He thought that only he can understand the game better than anyone else and that nobody really understood how he feels, or understood how great the game is.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review379155">
        Thinking to himself that no other game than Tackfam is worthy to play and spend your whole life improving upon.<br />
<br />
He then meets his lifelong gaming rival, that happens to be a girl, who&#039;s both a top gamer in Tackfam and in life.<br />
She tells him that she understands how he feels that Tackfam is the best game ever, but she also tells him that the game called &quot;life&quot; is also just as good.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s about a protagonist who has 0 life experience, no social skills, awkwardness, level 1 in the life game, etc. -- who tries his best to improve himself, goes out his comfort zone, does things that would make most people die of embarrassment.<br />
<br />
What I like about the protagonist is that he isn&#039;t a hateful loser, nor does he blame others for his shortcomings, nor does he play the victim card. He might be boring to most people, but he sure does as hell own his mistakes and learn from it. <br />
<br />
In short, He brought the things that got him to the top of Tackfam -- which is &quot;If you fail, learn from it and improve.&quot; mentality to the game called &quot;life&quot;

    We all have our own ways of separating ourselves from the real world. Video game is a hobby that has become synonymous with society especially with the ongoing worldwide pandemic. Of course, that’s the real world I’m talking about. Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun takes place in a fictional world that shows how one character decided to be a bottom-tier loser. And how does he spend all his time? Playing video games. Talk about being a degenerate.<br />
<br />
Based on the light novel, I admit coming into this series intimidated me a bit at first. Watching Tomozaki’s life as a gamer contrasts greatly between his real life image. It’s almost

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386909">
        like he’s living a double life. In the virtual world, he is unstoppable and a pro gamer. But from the real world, he’s a friendless loser that people want to avoid. I’m sure this type of character is relatable in some way at a school or workplace you’ve been to. This is a sharp contrast to characters such as Aoi Hinami, Mizusawa, or Mimimi. Those three represent the popular kids at school, the type that everyone wants to be friends with.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Aoi Hinami, she meets Tomozaki after the two faces each other in an online game. It doesn’t take long for her to realize Tomozaki’s outer image. So what happens then? She decides to teach him to play real life. That’s right, Tomozaki has his own personal life coach. It’s the hardest game Tomozaki will ever have to play because life is not like a game. He lacks friends, social experience, and in general, has a low self-esteem. No wonder he’s at the bottom tier. This is where Aoi’s role comes in. She teaches Tomozaki how to win at life but it doesn’t come easy. From the first few episodes, we see how lonely he is with a depressive attitude. He is afraid of himself especially with what he says to others and hence, he always try to be responsive than initiating conversations. It’s not until Aoi enters his life that he begins to change. Because in her opinion, Tomozaki can be just as great in real life compared to video games. <br />
<br />
From a character perspective, it’s shown that Tomozaki is actually quite intelligent and always analyzing situations before acting. Although he lacks confidence, he isn’t afraid of being honest and himself. Being truthful to others is especially important as creating a fake image is no way at winning in life. This contrasts to Mimimi, a popular girl who hides her vulnerable façade behind her cherry personality. With Aoi’s influence, Tomozaki begins to open up more including changing his appearance to be look more appealing and even learning how to smile. His social skills also improve as he learns from Aoi through first-hand experience. This includes talking to girls, going on a vacation trip, and interacting with the popular teens at school. It’s like Tomozaki is following a walkthrough with Aoi as her guidance. He’s not just playing the game. He’s living it.<br />
<br />
By storytelling standards, you get what you expect. Every episode has Tomozaki advancing forward in some way or form in real life. He makes new friends while gaining new skills and even an appreciation in himself. Now obviously, you have to be patient to see how Tomozaki changes but let’s just say that he makes quite bit of progress. Unfortunately, this doesn’t apply to his relationship status with the main cast. Even with the time they spend together, it feels like Tomozaki and Aoi’s relationship really went nowhere. Being labeled as a romantic dramedy, you’d at least have to expect some form of development right? Well not quite. From the first episode to the last, this show does a bottom tier job at relationship development. I’m not even entirely sure why this anime has ‘romance’ tagged under its umbrella. There’s barely any romantic elements in this show besides the ship teasing. Tomozaki and Aoi is the complete opposite of each other that it’s almost like Beauty and the Beast. His relationship with Izumi and Mimimi also goes to nowhere. So if you came to this show with a curiosity about romance, this is not the right place.<br />
<br />
Finally, I would like to mention that while the show has its fair share of drama, it’s mostly light so don’t expect the anime to be a tearjerker either. In fact, I’d label this show more of a lighthearted drama with a big chunk of social dialogues. Whether the show has its right target audience can be a bit ambiguous. However, this isn’t a complex storyteller either. It’s simply about a guy following a walkthrough in a real life.<br />
<br />
While the show isn’t a grand spectacle to look at, I will give credit where credit is due. The character designs appeals to teenage youth especially for the popular characters. It seems the camera itself is self-aware that focuses on certain body parts of the female cast. Whether this is intentional or not is up to you decide but it’s obvious the anime wanted to give the female cast an appealing image, especially for the popular characters. On the other hand, Tomozaki is portrayed with a moody face and dressed like a loner. Of course, it isn’t until he meets Aoi that his image begins to shine more. Finally, this show pays its video game homage. Attack Families is obviously based on the popular Super Smash Bros. franchise. It’s actually quite clever the show decided to pay homage to Super Smash Bros. as it’s among the most popular fighting game in the world. <br />
<br />
Look into his eyes and what do you see? A changed man or someone who didn’t win the game? Tomozaki has his life coach this season but it’s up to him to follow the steps to win. According to the famous Albert Einsten, “life is just like a game and you have to first learn the rules. And then play it better than anyone else”. How do you think Tomozaki played his game?

    :: This review was written after watching all 12 episodes and may contain some spoilers ::<br />
<br />
In a world where mediocre shows, even though being enjoyable, often have to concede in front of the pantheons of the show bizz. I feel like this show perfectly epitomizes that. Airing alongside shows like Attack on Titan, TenSura, Dr. Stone, and others, steals a lot of limelight that this show deserves although being a bit mundane.<br />
<br />
:: Story ~ 8 out of 10 ::<br />
The story of Bottom-Tier Character Tomozaki revolves around well, Tomozaki, who considers himself to be a bottom tired character in the game of &quot;real life&quot;. I feel

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386906">
        like some people can relate to that—being a pariah in the real world. But that isn&#039;t me but it didn&#039;t stop me from enjoying the show. The show introduces a variety of prospects like good music, cliched but loveable characters, and such and such, which which ameliorates its short comings. Don&#039;t get me wrong, this show is not a bowl of cherries with no faults, there are a lot of instances when I couldn&#039;t help but &quot;cringe&quot;. The MC relating every diminutive thing to &quot;normies&quot; or &quot;gamers&quot; was a bit overboard for me. But it&#039;s rewarding to see the plucky nature of the MC, who step up by step overcame his handicap, and in his own way, overcame his handicap.<br />
<br />
:: Art &amp; Sound ~ 8 out of 10 ::<br />
I really love both of these aspects of this anime, although not sterling, it is certainly not bad. The opening has a playful vibe to it which I really like and overall the art is pretty too. The characters are also so so well designed, especially the girls who are all adorable and chic!   <br />
<br />
:: Characters ~ 8 out of 10 ::<br />
Not being pernickety here, but I felt this part on the anime was lacking. Not being able to relate to any of the characters, I almost had a numb feeling towards them all. Although I could see what the anime was going for with Aoi Hinami&#039;s character—making people like you through subterfuge, but other than that, there was nothing more I could draw from other characters except Tomozaki with his gauche behaviour. Not enough time is provided to flesh out the personality of each character which develops milieus which lets us relate to the characters on a personal level. But you can&#039;t ask for detailed character analysis from a 13 episode cour show, so an 8 should suffice!<br />

:: Enjoyment &amp; Overall ~ 8 out of 10 ::<br />
I really like this show. It is the closest thing I could ask for to &#039;Gamers!&#039;, a show I really adore which never got a second season. Which brings me back to my initial statement, is the reason why this anime so looked down upon is because of the unsurprising aspect of it, or because they can&#039;t help but compare it to the other extraordinary shows it was airing with? We will probably never know...

    Warning: spoilers.<br />
<br />
Jakusha Character Tomozaki-kun, or Bottom-tier Character Tomozaki, is surprisingly boring in all ways possible to completely disappoint the viewers and let the source, a light novel, fall into the abyss of the forgotten Japanese otaku prose. It&#039;s the fault of the original that the anime&#039;s story sucks.<br />
<br />
Those who have already watched the first episode probably know that the story starts with the biggest coincidence possible with this kind of setting. The author was too lazy to think about how the main couple is supposed to meet so he had just made them the #1 and #2 top gamers playing the same fictional game called

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376360">
        Attack Families and living in Kaito. Okay, let&#039;s pretend that coincidences exist. If the author had risked to implement a blue-whale-sized coincidence into the story, then the next plot parts must be great, right? Wrong. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun is the type of anime that is supposed to be deep, considering its genres. Drama, romance, school. Yes, the last is right, the second is okay, but the first? Are you kidding me? The damn background music is only suitable for comedy genre, the dialogues aren&#039;t deep and are full of laughs and cringe-worthy gags. Why in the world I&#039;d call this a drama? There were no sad moments until episode 4, but because Jaku-Chara ruined the characters, I didn&#039;t really care. The OP doesn&#039;t match the genre, too, but we&#039;ll discuss it later. This anime looks like a typical SOL school rom-com, even considering the fact of using the gamer slang. It doesn&#039;t even try to be realistic. On top of that, the plot is extremely fast-paced. In episode 3, one girl told her secret to Tomozaki; the other one asks him to help her learn to play Attack Families. Isn&#039;t that too much for a single episode? As for the episode 4, the anime feels more like a harem than romance. <br />
<br />
Drama. If the plot sucks, then characters can entertain the viewers, right? Wrong. Fumiya Tomozaki, the MC, is cringy and boring. He learns how to socialise and become a god-tier character. Also, Fumiya doesn&#039;t quite do anything for the plot progression. Is he the MC we&#039;re supposed to feel for? He&#039;s not even a bit relatable. His personality is quite a big mystery, too, because sometimes he talks calmly and then just yells at someone (ep 1 and 4). The major plot device of the anime is Aoi Hinami, the main girl who is what Fumiya calls god-tier. She does everything, and the plot goes on. She&#039;s changing Tomozaki-kun by giving him her tasks (I must admit that they really might help Fumiya become a god-tier character, but the other parts are just horrible, so the plot is bad). The other characters are generic and overall quite unlikable, not gonna mention them (even though their designs are decent).<br />
<br />
The themes covered in Jaku-Chara are also old. A teenager escapes from reality using his hobby? Yes, our MC does so. Someone or any circumstances make him try to socialise? Again, there it is. I know the piece shouldn&#039;t be 100% unique but jeez, THIS one doesn&#039;t even try to entertain the viewers and serve them an original story, the interesting characters.<br />
<br />
The art is mediocre, except the moments when the anime decides to show us a closeup of some girl&#039;s legs. Where did the budget go? The animation is okay but not decent enough for 2021 level. The soundtrack is boring, it doesn&#039;t even feel like I&#039;m watching drama.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s all I wanted to write about. Jakusha Character Tomozaki-kun is generic, boring, unfunny, unrealistic, doesn&#039;t have anything in common with drama or comedy. Its plot is a mess filled with terrible dialogues. A pure boredom. The titles like this come out nearly every year. Don&#039;t waste your time and please consider skipping or dropping this.

    In a season packed full of highly anticipated sequels, Tomozaki-Kun rose to the top and became my favourite show of the season. Week after week, episodes flew by in what seemed like a few minutes. The characters and premise of the show provided one of the more memorable experiences I’ve had with a slice of life in some time.<br />
<br />
For me, Tomozaki-Kun is what most people THINK Oregairu is. The concept of a socially inept loser going from a shut-in to normal high schooler is flawlessly executed here. Normally in these types of shows, the MC’s character development doesn’t feel organic or realistic. Either the MC

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386902">
        moves too fast, or too slow. Here we have a protagonist who takes gradual but sure steps out of his comfort zone in order to improve himself and make genuine connections with others. Week in and week out we see Tomozaki become more open to other people and learn more about how interpersonal relationships work. I love the analogous relationship of a video game character’s development to Tomozaki’s and think it offers a unique perspective on this type of show.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there were a great deal of people who wrote this show off after a couple weeks. Is the MC a loser who says and does cringe things at the start? Yes. That’s kind of the point of the series. What would be the point if a character already starts off as an alpha chad who has nothing else to learn or room to grow? If you can bear with the MC’s growing pains in the beginning, I think you’ll find Tomozaki-Kun to be a very enjoyable show.<br />
<br />
I’ve said all that and haven’t even touched on the girls in this show. As with most shows in this genre, Tomozaki’s development is caused and expedited by a girl at school, and there are several potential waifus who play major roles in the series. Unlike other anime in this genre, these are fully fleshed out and well written characters with their own unique quirks and personalities. The girls are not just there for fan service or shipping wars, but offer genuine value to this series and are one of the most enjoyable parts.<br />
<br />
All in all, Tomozaki-Kun was by far one of the top 2 or 3 most enjoyable shows this season. It’s one of only a few that I actually looked forward to on a weekly basis and now that the season is over, I can’t wait to get into the LNs. Tomozaki-Kun gets 10 tackfams out of 10.

    Bottom-Tier Tomozaki is the hidden gem of this season. Many dropped it at first while those who remained slowly began to notice how their view changed, just like the characters did. It’s a Romcom that isn’t revolutionary but introduces concepts that makes it interesting and engaging to follow.<br />
It was certainly a show that exceeded my expectations.<br />
It’s a true character growth driven story of becoming a better person.<br />
<br />
On its surface it’s nothing mind-blowing and appears to be a standard Romcom about an unpopular guy who somehow meets the legend of the class and gets a harem that you&#039;ve seen countless times yet this assumption is very

        misleading and Tomozaki, despite appearing as such, is not at all like that.<br />
All the girls introduced are not meant to be part of his harem and the show has wrongly been labeled as such. They are characters that get development themselves, as well as aiding the development of our MC while not coming off as too cliche or tropey. They really feel like people that you could meet in real life.<br />
<br />
While you may argue that the situation that our MC, the top player in Atafami finds himself in is very hard to relate to, you have to acknowledge the effort he puts in to change himself. I&#039;d say that the beginning doesn’t seem promising at all but the more we level up the greater it becomes. Everyone deserves a second chance if given the opportunity, right? Then even he should be able to fight to change himself for the better and we, as the audience should understand where he is coming from and not mock his efforts. Such a view is very misleading, and could lead to incorrect assumptions. No matter what, the fact still remains that in order to achieve something, even winning a mere game, you have to put your entire heart and soul into it - something I find admirable.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a show that is neither a generic Romcom nor a harem. Its main appeal is the theme of self improvement through hard work and desire, something that would be praise worthy to many and becomes apparent in how our main hero grows as a character and as a human being.<br />
Growth doesn&#039;t happen overnight.<br />
It&#039;s a long process that requires a lot of time and soul put into it.<br />
This is the message the show tries to convey and we can see how the behaviour and self esteem of Tomozaki evolves the more he levels up and the audience that learns from his mistakes and the quests given by our main girl, Hinami Aoi.<br />
<br />
The quests that the main girl gives to MC may seem trivial but are actually helpful in the grand scheme of things. It&#039;s one of the main criticisms that the show has received - that it’s cringy, unrealistic and out of touch with reality which is clearly wrong. We should remember that Tomozaki is a loner that has troubles with social interaction therefore these trivial goals that she sets up for him are actually very meaningful despite being so small. The type of a goal doesn&#039;t matter, what truly matters is the effort you put in order to achieve said goal.<br />
<br />
The animation of this show is very minimalistic with no dynamic movement. At times it serves as a means to move from point A to point B. The majority of the content delivered is through the dialogue of characters. It&#039;s decent. While it&#039;s certainly not top tier, it&#039;s no doubt bearable to watch. <br />
<br />
There were few memorable OSTs that played during crucial scenes but often than not it was a sad piano to create the atmosphere or a very light hearted soundtrack to rekindle hope. Overall the music wasn&#039;t as memorable but not that bad. I&#039;d like to point out that even the lyrics of a song matter in this show so keep an eye on that.<br />
From a show that started with an interesting premise that at first became something to make fun of, Tomozaki changed for the better and so did the viewers who were watching his development unfold.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a series that while not revolutionizing the genre made something unique and intriguing enough to follow by showcasing real character growth that rarely ever happens these days.<br />
If you wish to see a tale of a man who changed his life from the better, struggled but with effort and heart reached his goals, then I recommend watching &quot;Bottom-Tier Tomozaki&quot;.<br />

    I was really surprised when Jaku-chara Tomozaki-kun had a very low score at the beginning. I Really Enjoyed this show. It is true that there were a lot of awkward statements made by our Fumiya-kun But it was so funny that I was barely able to hold my laughter.<br />
<br />
::Story::8/10::<br />
The story was quite intriguing. It was satisfying to see a unpopular guy turn into a normal kid with a couple of new friends. And I liked the Idea of having goals to beat in each episode. It was pretty interesting.<br />
<br />
::Art::8/10::<br />
The Art was Nice and somewhat different compared to many anime. But there is not much you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386913">
        can point out.<br />
<br />
::Sound::8/10::<br />
I didn&#039;t have any concerns regarding the sound. If I can say something about it I can say it is calm and refreshing.<br />
<br />
::Character::8/10::<br />
The characters are cute and well drawn. I dont know what more to say so lets get to the next one.<br />
<br />
::Excitement::8/10::<br />
Like I said there isn&#039;t much to point out in this show. I really liked the story and the way Tomozaki is changing each episode. This is a show that Didn&#039;t make me feel disappointed. <br />
<br />
Bye-Bye!!

    In a world where terrible humour is rampant and a Super Smash Bros rip-off is so popular that even the outgoing normies play it- cue Tomozaki, a lonely, introverted, outcast of the society. Uh oh, you know what that means right? He has all the qualities to be an epic gamer! Can&#039;t we all relate to that?<br />
<br />
Out of all the tropes in anime, this trope of how the number one player of any popular game has to be an introverted sad freak who is unsuccessful in life and unable to fit in, is the worst trope ever. It&#039;s a dumb and illogical trope. Think about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386908">
        it, if you&#039;re the number one player of a very popular game, are you really unsuccessful? Does it really mean that you have no talent and no one has a use for you? Ever heard of e-sports? Let&#039;s just say that there&#039;s no e-sports in the world of this anime. Even then it makes no sense. If a game is popular, then a lot of people are wasting their time on it, so obviously people are gonna hold the number one player of that game in some respect. Heck, he could even start teaching others how to get good at the game.<br />
But no, if you&#039;re a number one player of a game, it means that you have no life and you can&#039;t fit in with other people.<br />
<br />
Enough rants about gamers and gaming, I&#039;m not a gamer but I just had to point out how dumb that trope is, since that trope is basically the base of this anime and Tomozaki as a character.<br />
<br />
Before I begin the actual review, let me point it out that I&#039;m reviewing this anime, not volume 69 of the novel. I know that there are a lot of light novel purists for this anime, that&#039;s why I wanted to remind them that I don&#039;t care about the light novel or what happens in the future story line.<br />
<br />
The entire first season is just Aoi Hinami, the female MC, trying to teach Tomozaki basic human interaction knowledge, it&#039;s so fun isn&#039;t it! Instead of getting professional help, Tomozaki completes daily tasks given by Aoi Hinami. These tasks include forcing yourself to talk to another classmate for a few minutes, &quot;messing&quot; with another classmate at least three times and getting a girlfriend. Her idea is that this so called task system resembles a game and if Tomozaki hears the word &quot;Game&quot; he must get super horny, so that&#039;s why she keeps giving him all these tasks daily and increases the difficulty of the task day by day.<br />
<br />
Every time Tomozaki can&#039;t do something, he&#039;ll say that he can&#039;t do that because he is a &quot;bottom tier character&quot;. You can&#039;t get a girlfriend? Oh man you must be a bottom tier character. You don&#039;t have any friends? You must be a bottom tier character. Tomozaki&#039;s coping mechanism is so annoying, at one point I&#039;ve had it with him. He thinks life is a game and whenever Hinami says that &quot;Think of life as a game!&quot; He gets all riled up, so riled up that he can do anything! Tomozaki is not a bottom tier character, he is more of a spectator because everything in the anime just happens and he just happens to be near those happenings, it&#039;s not like he does anything special other than making unfunny jokes which are not really jokes but everyone in the anime laughs anyways.<br />
<br />
Here is literally a conversation taken right from the anime-<br />
Mizusawa: You really are a hard worker. Aren&#039;t you Tomozaki?<br />
Tomozaki: I&#039;d say I&#039;m more of a gamer.<br />
Mizusawa: You are a funny guy<br />
Tomozaki: That&#039;s not really a compliment<br />
Misuzawa: It is!<br />
<br />
That&#039;s literally one of the conversation. To Tomozaki, this is his idea of messing with someone. And surprisingly, the other character sees Tomozaki as a comedy god, not only that character but literally every other  character laughs at these so called jokes that Tomozaki often makes (That I always seem to miss) and everyone starts laughing. If you want, you can ask me for those moments and I will show you a clip of it, you&#039;ll understand what I mean by &quot;terrible humour&quot;. I can&#039;t stand Tomozaki, he&#039;s pain inducingly cringe. But hey, at least he gets better later.. right?<br />
<br />
And now, we talk about the other MC of the anime, if you think Tomozaki is bad, boy oh boy, you haven&#039;t seen anything. Cue Aoi Hinami, a literal deity. She is the perfect human and according to Tomozaki, she is the number one player in the game of life. Let me explain- She&#039;s good looking, she is popular among her close friends, classmates and the entire school, she is an amazing track runner, she is an amazing basketball player, she is the top student of her class/school, and she is also the 2nd best player of the Super Smash Bros rip-off game that Tomozaki is no. 1 in. See what I mean by a deity? What I fail to understand, even if she puts a ton of effort into all subjects, how is she good at everything? She has enough time to study and become the top student of her school, she has enough time to mingle and maintain a good relationship with her friends, she has enough time to do makeup, she has enough time to practice for basketball, she has enough time to practice track, she has enough time to climb all the way up to the 2nd place in the most popular video game. How? And when Tomozaki called her a top tier character, she probably also says that she had to put a ton of effort, so I&#039;m guessing she wasn&#039;t born a deity. Even so, how did she manage to become so good at everything? We have no answer. Even though she&#039;s good at everything, she claims that her being perfect is only an act. When Tomozaki and Hinami had that little fight where Tomozaki being a reasonable person for ONCE in the entire anime, and Hinami got mad at him. Basically Tomozaki refused to do one of her task which was to confess to a girl, because he thought that those weren&#039;t his true feelings and he was doing it because Hinami told her to do so. After hearing this Hinami got mad and gave a cringy speech, I might be wrong but from what I understood, all she said was &quot;What is point of doing what you want? That&#039;s a waste of time! Doing what others expect of you is a true productive human!&quot; So basically, in summary, Aoi Hinami is a slave and she was mad that Tomozaki wasn&#039;t a slave like her.<br />
Other characters are boring and have nothing special to them, emphasize on the &#039;nothing&#039;, absolutely nothing. The side characters are so boring, they often come on screen to remind us that the main characters aren&#039;t as boring as them.<br />
<br />
Animation is just average, nothing special to it. All the budget went into animating the lips of female characters, which were the only good thing about this entire anime.<br />
<br />
The ending sequence, which deserves a better anime, is the only redeeming thing about the sound aspect of this anime. Because voice acting is meh at best and they tried to add sad piano soundtracks like OreGairu and miserably failed.<br />
<br />
My overall impression of this anime is just bad. I wouldn&#039;t recommend this anime to anyone. This anime is pseudo deep. The only reason why I thought I should give this a chance was because people claimed that this is as good as OreGairu, which was a massive lie. If you&#039;re having trouble sleeping, then this anime might help, otherwise if you haven&#039;t seen it, then don&#039;t. Well, it&#039;s all up to you anyways.

    Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun is about your typical loner gamer dude who plays *not* Smash Bros at a very high level, and decides to one day meet up with the person right after him on the leaderboard, who ends up being a cute, popular girl from his class. After this meeting, this girl, Aoi, having scolded our protagonist, decides to help him out by teaching him how to become a riajuu, a “normie” you could say.<br />
<br />
I really wish I were be here right now saying good things about this show and how I used some of the advice Aoi gave to Tomozaki myself, but alas, here I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387013">
        am, incredibly disappointed by what could have been a nice romcom with a school settingf. The show presents an interesting idea, I haven’t actually seen anything like it before, but the execution of the premise set in place by the first few episodes is a complete miss.<br />
<br />
So, what is this premise? Tomozaki goes through several lessons with Aoi, who teaches him basic social skills, manners, posture, and so on, and gives him challenges such as “talk to three different girls” or “force a smile while wearing a mask”. Tomozaki doesn’t necessarily do well at completing these challenges, but he does try his earnest to do so, more often than not with the help of Aoi. Here is my first issue with show. If the whole premise is about the evolution of a loner into a riajuu, then why does Aoi do most of the work for him? It would be way more satisfying to watch Tomozaki do these challenges on his own, failing them or not, with all the cringy situations that these challenges may bring. I fail to understand why Aoi would be so invested into a random dude she met online. She’s not in love with him, and Tomozaki’s first impression on her was awful. Is it pity? Is it self-fulfillment? Who knows, but Aoi intervening as much as she does only reinforces all of the problems this show has.<br />
<br />
There’s an analogy Jaku-Chara brings up regarding real life and games, even though it’s slightly “cringy”. If real life is treated as a game, then the social skills and achievements can be the equivalent of the skills and achievements in a video game. Tomozaki being really good Tackfam comes with a contrast of him being really bad at real life. This brings up quite a disparity. If you’ve ever played a fighting game, you’d know how much effort it takes to be good, let alone a top level player in said game, even in a game like Smash Bros. It takes years and years of practice before you could consider yourself competent at a fighting game, practice that Tomozaki has clearly put into Tackfam out of his passion for the game. So why is it that he goes from being a complete loner to a good looking socially capable guy in the span of 4-5 episodes?! How come the show is 12 episodes long when Tomozaki achieves all but one of his goals in 5 episodes? Of course, the rest of the show feels like filler content that serves close to no purpose to the overall plotline. I will attribute this to poor pacing. I assume that the light novel goes way deeper into Tomozaki’s struggles and hardships, or at least I hope so.<br />
<br />
You might now ask me, “why am I comparing real life scenarios to fiction?” or “Why does it matter that Tomozaki achieved his goals quickly?”. The answer to that is simple, suspension of disbelief. <br />
<br />
I’ll let you google what suspension of disbelief means if you don’t know this term, but it’s a fancy way of referring to the reader or watcher believing and investing themselves into a given scenario. Here lies the main problem of Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun: I do not believe a single event that happens in the anime.<br />
<br />
When you pick a school setting for your work of fiction, you can go down two paths, a realistic depiction of high school life with down to earth, believable characters (for example, Hibike! Euphonium), or an absurd depiction of high school with extraordinary events and out-of-this-earth characters (for example, Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu). These paths aren’t that well defined, and most of the time you can get away with mixing absurd characters with regular high school events (for example, Chuu2Koi), which ends up being quite a nice way of showing what a character is going through, be it a completely exaggerated depiction of an emotion or an emphasis on the importance of a particular event in the character’s life. Chuu2Koi does this with chuuni magic battles, Monogatari does this with long elaborate dialogue, although Monogatari isn’t your typical high school setting show. Point is, your story and characters have to be believable or relatable. You want the reader or viewer to care for the characters you’ve written. As for Tomozaki, his only relatable point is that he’s a loner, and so are most anime watchers. Nobody will relate to being the best at a certain game, and very few will relate to being competent to a high level at a certain game, and most certainly NOBODY will relate to Tomozaki’s character progression. Without being relatable, the main character now must appeal to the audience with his actions, most of which are dictated by a third party or happenstance. He’s effectively a puppet of the other characters in the show, sometimes adding his own ad lib to the situations he finds himself in. Even after becoming a “normie” 5 episodes in, Tomozaki just comes off as bland and uninteresting. He’s nothing like OreGairu’s Hachiman who’s a way better example of a loner working on himself in order to become a better human being. This is the main problem, Jaku-Chara is too unrealistic to be a down to earth high school romcom, and too ordinary to be an absurd high school romcom. The viewer is stuck in a situation where they cannot relate to the main character while also not being able to enjoy his personality or the results of his actions. They cannot “suspend their disbelief” in order to fully invest themselves in the show. <br />
<br />
The other characters don’t help. Aoi has no personality, she hardly even fits a trope. She’s somewhat twofaced, but not enough for her to be an appealing or interesting character. Minami isn’t a character; I refuse to acknowledge that someone wrote her as she is. She’s an amalgamation of completely different charm points and gags that the writer probably finds appealing in a waifu. She is so over-the-top energetic that it becomes hard to watch any scene that involves her. Izumi is your generic high school girl, again, without a personality. Out of the female characters, this only leaves Kikuchi, voiced by Kayano Ai, who I like a lot, and Hanabi, who’s cute and inoffensive. I could mention the male characters, but other than Nakamura, who’s sort of another rival to Tomozaki, they, yet again, serve no purpose and just act as filler content, NPCs for Tomozaki to interact with.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Kayano Ai, her and Nobuhiko make this show bearable. The rest of the voice actors are unremarkable at best, obnoxious at worst. Hasegawa Ikumi does an awful job at Minami, but then again, Minami is an abomination of a character, so that’s most likely because of poor direction.<br />
<br />
The opening is a cheerful song by DIALOGUE+, an unknown idol group, and sounds as generic as you’d expect it to. I thought it was ok at first, but it very quickly got obnoxious to listen to. The ending is unremarkable, as one would expect.<br />
<br />
Finally, the art and character design are fine. They’re bland, and I absolute hate the modern character design standards when it comes to drawing eyes and faces, but that’s just me. Again, unremarkable, but at least the animation isn’t appalling.<br />
<br />
Without a solid and interesting story, Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun fails to entice the viewer with its unremarkable characters. The viewer finds themselves watching seemingly unbelievable events unfold as the main character lackadaisically moves from happenstance to happenstance that just happen to work out in his favour. Without achievements that can be attributed to Tomozaki’s efforts, the show feels like an empty shell with no substance, an exhibition of events that collectively have no impact.<br />
<br />
There is very little to take away from Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun, I wouldn’t recommend trying Aoi’s advice in real life, let alone watching the show. If you want a good story about a loner working on himself, watch OreGairu.<br />
<br />
TL;DR:<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
-Kayano Ai voicing a cute taciturn bookworm<br />
-The first couple of episodes and tips<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
-Unremarkable characters<br />
-Unbelievable events<br />
-The show fails to suspend the viewer’s disbelief<br />
-Little to no substance – an exposition of random events<br />
-Minami<br />
-Awful pacing<br />
<br />
Final Score: 2/10<br />
<br />
Thank you Kayano Ai for saving this show from being a 1/10. God bless.<br />

    I don&#039;t understand how anyone could possibly enjoy this. From what I can see, it&#039;s simply a show with decent art and a possibly interesting start. <br />
<br />
The main point of this show is that an unsocial high schooler gets tips and tricks from a riaju to help him become more social. The premise is really quite stupid as in real life, unsocial people wouldn&#039;t be talking with others let alone one of the most popular people in the school. <br />
<br />
The characters in this show are somewhat unique, but they&#039;re mostly all disgusting people. Take the riaju for example. Her meeting with the main character is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review379561">
        through a game called &quot;tackfam&quot; or essentially a rip off of super smash where she&#039;s rated 2nd in the game while the mc is 1st. To me, her real reason of meeting him is to find someone that&#039;s better than her and I&#039;m assuming to date or hang out with. Unfortunately for her, she meets the mc, an unsocial guy in her class, and some of her first few words to him are just insults. <br />
<br />
What is her problem? I&#039;m not really sure, but she clearly believes that he&#039;s failed in the game of life. She&#039;s utterly disappointed that the only person that she found that was better than her was a quitter and basically a loser. The fact that you only respect people better than you is absolutely disgusting.<br />
<br />
She accuses the mc of quitting in the game of life and that he&#039;s not a &quot;gamer&quot; and the mc is forced to either accept that he&#039;s a loser or get better in the game of life. However, there&#039;s nothing wrong with quitting. If you&#039;re doing drugs and someone explained that you&#039;re a quitter for quitting drugs, is there something wrong with that? She then decides to help him win in life. Why? There&#039;s really no reason for you to help him out at all, but one possibility is that you&#039;re improving him to date him. <br />
<br />
She goes on to create a set of goals to help him improve, and one of them specifically is to get a girlfriend. Dating someone for the sake of achieving a goal is honestly really disgusting. You&#039;re toying with other people&#039;s feelings to simply feel good about achieving your goal and not to nurture the relationship. She clearly doesn&#039;t care about other people, yet other people view her as a goddess. <br />
<br />
Another thing she recommends the mc to do is to memorize conversation topics. Yes. Memorize conversation topics. Does anyone actually do this because if they do, they definitely have some serious problems. Additionally, she tells him to start a conversation with a female. As someone with few friends in real life, I can confidently say that it&#039;s nearly impossible for me to do so and it will certainly be awkward. However, the mc feels practically nothing. While it is awkward, he breezes past it like doing so is normal. He doesn&#039;t even have a fml moment and acts like nothing happened.<br />
<br />
The mediocre plot and the appalling characters make this show an absolute wash. While a few moments are nice and some characters are waifu material, I don&#039;t think they can save the show. <br />
<br />
3/10

    So , I have watched 4 episodes while currently writing this , And I have been noticing a lot of hate towards this show , I can see why most wont relate to this (Neither do I , I do play games but not this heavily) , but saying this show is absolute trash is just &quot;2Cool4U&quot; attitude .<br />
<br />
Now coming to the review section , i would say that , yes , this show is worth your time , this is nowhere near the best anime of this season , but still it is a fun watch . You might even be able to get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377902">
        some good pointers if you have anxiety while interacting with people .<br />
<br />
What i like most about this anime though is that it portrays most cases perfectly . It actually tries to show how different types of people interact and how to deal with certain social situations . At least try to watch the first 3 episodes of this series and then decide if you like this or not .<br />
<br />
So , to summarise , this show is plenty good and you shuld definitely check this out . This was my first review so this might not be very good but you should really try this show regardless of the low score on mal . Rest assured it would be worth the time you put in this !

    First of all, I literally thought that this is going to be a typical Harem anime, but it wasn&#039;t. It did justify the &quot;comedy&quot; genre, but somehow I felt it lacked or rather did injustice to <br />
&quot;romance&quot; genre. It was basically a gamer trying to think life as a game too and tried to raise his level but somewhere along the line he realised he wasn&#039;t doing what he &quot;really wanted&quot;. <br />
<br />
It did have some comic moments and its a good slice of life but it wasn&#039;t, not even a little a romantic anime. It was more like friendly kind of thing and nothing more.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386961">
        But even so, if it does gets a sequel and justifies the &quot;romance&quot; part of the story then that would be something to look forward to.<br />
<br />
Overall, you can watch it if you are bored or something like that. But not worth that much of attention though. My rating would be somewhat 4/10.
