    Breathtaking and seamless animation. I&#039;m glad they translated Igarashi Daisuke&#039;s art to the big screen pretty well. The art and the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and I&#039;m also a sucker for animes with the ocean/summer days/ fantasy aesthetic themes (reminded me of the anime Nagi no Asukara). Seeing it on the big screen gave me that same chest expanding feeling whenever I see amazing animation alongside moving soundtracks. <br />
<br />
Honestly, the storyline lost me a little bit but I&#039;m not gonna say I wasn&#039;t entertained and absorbed. I would still highly recommend for the imagery. Can&#039;t wait until it is released in English to rewatch it!

    Let me tell you first off, tokyo movie theaters are not cheap!!! $20 for a ticket are you insane?! I&#039;d better be getting my money&#039;s worth if I&#039;m paying that much. Like this movie better change my life. <br />
<br />
Next I want to let you know that I&#039;ve never read the source, or heard of this title before watching this movie. So this review is my impression of the movie watching it blind.<br />
<br />
Story - 4<br />
SPOILER ALERT<br />
It actually started off really great in my opinion. The premise of a boy who was raised in the wild is not something entirely new but still very interesting. And it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311911">
        was going so well until somewhere halfway through the movie... UNIVERSE, COSMOS, GALAXY... Like WTF was I watching? I&#039;m sorry for all the people who liked this movie but it just felt totally random to me in terms of the story. I can&#039;t actually imagine how you make any sense of what I just watched. I feel like they literally let a 5 year old write the story and you might think I&#039;m joking but that&#039;s really how it is. Sure the animation is great but the story...<br />
<br />
Art - 10<br />
I don&#039;t think anyone can argue how breathtakingly amazing the art was. Watching this movie is like watching an animated version of the big book of marine life encyclopedia. Definitely watch this movie if you want to learn how to draw any fish. If nothing else, this is definitely one of the &quot;best animated&quot; movies (not to be mistaken with best &quot;animated movies&quot;)<br />
<br />
Sound - 9<br />
Is the rubber band an instrument?<br />
Kaijuu no Kodomo would say: Yes, yes it is!<br />
Mysterious, eerie, a sense of wonder and excitement. Wonderfully orchestrated and beautifully directed. Who doesn&#039;t love this kind of music? One thing&#039;s for sure: they definitely spared no expense in the sound and animation budget.<br />
<br />
Character - 5<br />
The designs are really nice and unique. There&#039;s a lot of mystery with how the characters were introduced which I think is fine in itself. Unfortunately, the story is just so weird that it&#039;s hard to make sense of anything the characters are thinking, if they are thinking anything. You can&#039;t tell what the hell is going on and there&#039;s barely any explanation either.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 4<br />
As someone who&#039;s never read the source or remotely heard of the title before watching this I felt like a fish out of water (pun intended). Maybe they cut a lot of material from the source. Maybe the writing is just bad. Maybe maybe maybe... From my perspective, the story is just weird. At the very least, I enjoyed the animation.<br />
<br />
Overall - 6<br />
I would definitely recommend it, even just for the beautiful animation. But definitely not for anyone who&#039;s looking for any coherent story or emotional impact.<br />

    For those that are curious, this is an animated adaption from the manga with the same name, beautifully illustrated by Igarashi Daisuke. For starters, I think the film was definitely ambitious, but in honesty was all round lacking in a sense that the director could not successfully portray the clarity within the material of the original work. <br />
<br />
<br />
STORY: (7/10) Five whole volumes of plot, filled with existentialistic concepts combining science fiction and supernatural themes, delicate portrayals of the relationship between the characters and the panoramas of sea life- all of these are condensed into a mere 111 minutes, a little less than two hours. Nevertheless,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310458">
        I applaud the teams&#039; effort in trying to follow the footsteps of the manga with their universal and surrealistic message; However, if you are a manga reader like me, I suggest that you don&#039;t keep your hopes too high that every detail would be the same. Some scenes were replaced and rewritten in order to fit in the time frame, while others, I really don&#039;t understand the choices for such replacements. I also felt that some of the more important and emotional parts were cut out as well, which really takes away the overall tone and message of the manga. (eg, Sora and Umi&#039;s backstory with Jim and Anglade, which would have provided a LOT more insight towards their relationship with one another, as well as the plot of the story).<br />
Kaijuu no Kodomo is a free form of expression, but Ayumu Watanabe doesn&#039;t seem to be able to grasp onto what is needed in order for the film to have become successful. Overall a promising story which gradually loses it&#039;s way to mass targeting. If I had to make a comparison- the film made me think of Finding Nemo or some fantasy related ocean cartoon. I felt comfortable watching the film, and that was the problem; The ocean in the manga made me wonder, doubt, and fear the terrifying beauty of the depths of the sea, as well as the haunting panoramas of the marine life. <br />
<br />
<br />
ART: (8/10) The character designs stayed true to Igarashi&#039;s indie, sketchy style, which I was very delighted to see. Precisions and details elaborating on the eyes of the characters give more emotional depths to our understanding of their roles within the narrative. I could also say the same to the way the ocean and the marine life had been beautifully animated, especially during the &quot;festival&quot; and Umi&#039;s &quot;birth&quot;. Movements are smooth and stylistically &#039;wonky&#039;, yet again possessing the sentiments of Igarashi&#039;s funkiness. I&#039;d say the minor flaw in the art was the use of CGI, which were not the best ones I&#039;ve seen- it kind of takes away the mysterious feeling of the ocean when you compare it to the manga. The ocean in the film makes everything seem all too welcoming and friendly, instead of haunting and dangerous. Nevertheless, the animation is definitely something worth praising, and it&#039;s rare to see water, and movement in the water being drawn so smoothly. <br />
<br />
<br />
MUSIC: (10/10) It&#039;s Joe Hisaishi, nothing can go wrong when it&#039;s him. He perfectly captured the oceanic vibes with his use of &#039;random number technique&#039;, and uses the same melody throughout important scenes, just with different variations. The brass instruments give off a more exotic feel and really captures the cultural aspects of the story, while the orchestra as a whole representing life within the sea. I am not a music expert, but his melodies never failed to provoke some emotional response within me. <br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: (6.5/10) That being said, major characters such as Jim, Anglade (ESPECIALLY ANGLADE!) and Dede were robbed of their spotlights in the film due to the limited time. They had their defining roles, but were reduced to such labels- Jim was a scientist who merely looked after Sora and Umi, Anglade cooked dinner and did some chores, and spouted some universal nonsense under the starlights, and Dede? She repeated the same 5 lines about 10 times in the film, then drove away on a boat without contributing much to the plot. I was especially disappointed to see that they have taken away so much of Anglade&#039;s charm, since he was one of the most important and intriguing characters of the story. Like Sora and Umi, he was an outsider, he was intelligent, sophisticated and complicated- yet they have made him into a pretty insignificant person in the film, cooked some fish then left. <br />
Likewise, Ruka&#039;s mother also did not get her backstory, which I felt would have helped a lot with explaining Ruka&#039;s natural attraction towards the water. I don&#039;t understand the reason for having Ruka&#039;s father replace Dede in the final scene when they went to rescue Ruka too. Perhaps this film focused a lot more on Ruka and her estrangement with her friends and family- but I quite liked the idea of her reconciling with the girl she knocked over in the beginning, which is anime exclusive. It somehow added another kind of sentiment and changed the narrative (in a good way), as if to relay the message that life moves on. With the people Ruka met during summer gone, it&#039;s like she was being welcomed back to her ordinary life (which in this case, you may argue that it takes away her eccentrics and the fact that she doesn&#039;t get along with everyone, but again, they&#039;re children). <br />
I had no major problems with the three protagonists, but somehow felt that they were all lacking the charm they had in the manga- the film took all their most obvious traits (Umi and his naivety, Sora and his otherworldliness, Ruka and her curiosity) and made them kind of one dimensional. Ruka in particular became more taciturn in some major scenes, instead of being her usual curious self regarding the two boys who, in the film, were a lot less preoccupied with one another. <br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: (7 or 8/10) Again, this was a promising film considering that the manga was particularly a masterpiece. It&#039;s ambitious, it&#039;s creative, it could have created something new for the audience- but the choice of director has allowed it to lose its colour throughout the film. It&#039;s not as philosophical or complicated as the original material, but nevertheless attempts to recreate the same message in a very condensed animated version. However, I overall thought it was still quite enjoyable. For those that may find the film confusing or constantly feel like it&#039;s missing something, I really suggest that you read the manga first, as it will help you understand a lot of aspects and ideas they don&#039;t mention and explain in the film. The characters in the manga are portrayed with such raw emotions, and Igarashi miraculously writes their relationship with one another through such vertiginous depths that you can&#039;t help but love every single one of their quirks. <br />
I do suggest the film to those that may be interested, but only if you decide to read the manga as well. Trust me, you won&#039;t regret it!

    RIGHT OFF THE BAT!!! THIS REVIEW IS NOT SPOILER FREE!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not gonna lie I originally posted this review/report in a twitter thread but it&#039;s so detailed it deserves to be a review here. Due to this though, it&#039;s not in the standard review form.<br />
<br />
Report: Children of the Sea (film)<br />
<br />
Aaaaaaa I loved the film so so much (non manga reader)<br />
<br />
Overall it was a very solid movie (cont. SPOILERS)<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: this is all opinion!!! You can disagree!!! You can agree!!!<br />
<br />
Storyline<br />
<br />
The story was easy enough to follow but I could tell they&#039;d removed a number of other plotlines in order to fit the main story into a short 110 minutes.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310504">
        The biggest example being the hinted abuse, exploitation and mistreated of Umi and Sora by the oceanographers. This missing plotline then tied in with the science of the boys&#039; deteriorating physical condition, Joe&#039;s actions and disappearance towards the end of the film, and  Anglade&#039;s relation to the happenings of the film, leaving many questions unresolved. The history of the &quot;festival&quot; is also left unsaid, adding more questions. Despite this, the movie still flows well and all of the things mentioned above come from my own observatory inclinations. Much is left out, but not enough to spoil the film for a non manga reader (me). The main story doesn&#039;t give quite enough information to become invested in the characters, namely the 3 leads. Sora and Umi (esp Sora) are gone almost as soon as they appear with how the film was paced. (Personal statement but Sora is a little shit and I love him for it).<br />
<br />
Animation<br />
Animation was above average but obviously not UBW level. The art (which is adapted well from page to screen) was the real breadwinner for this film. I will note, though, that the use of CG was done very nicely. CG is looking like the next big step in anime and this film is definitely a shuffle forward. That being said it could be thanks to the art and its compatibility to the medium. <br />
<br />
Art<br />
It must be said that the artwork and style of the film is absolutely breathtaking. The last 30 minutes of the film showcase some of the most gorgeous, detailed art I&#039;ve ever seen in the medium, and I&#039;d dare say that Children of the Sea challenged Itou Junji&#039;s oceanic masterpiece Gyo more than a few times, namely the deep sea shark that is showcased. <br />
<br />
Music (OST by Joe Hisaishi)<br />
Hisaishi composed for greats like Spirited Away, Laputa, other Ghibli classics and This Corner Of The World (drama). Unfortunately, his composition for Children of the Sea failed to capture me like it had countless times before. This was probably due to lack of &quot;That One Track&quot;, that one work in the OST that manages to stick with you even after you&#039;ve left the theatre. The reason for this track not existing within the Children fo the Sea soundtrack is due to Kenshi Yonezu&#039;s Umi no Yuurei. Despite this, the soundtrack still serves its purpose, and quite well at that. Subtle changes in tone between land and ocean  made all the difference, and really added weight to the characters&#039; movements depending on the setting at the time and scenes where the two tones met were truly majestic.<br />
<br />
Theme song<br />
The theme song of Children of the Sea is Umi no Yuurei (ghost of the sea) by Kenshi Yonezu, a song I&#039;ve been raving about since its release before the film. You can tell Yonezu put a lot of love into the song, and its relation to Children of the Sea is undeniable with the lyrics seeming to be the words of Ruka for Umi and Sora whom she&#039;ll never &quot;see&quot; again, yet is forever tied to.It&#039;s so hard for me to not go crazy analysing Umi no Yuurei as there&#039;s so much I could talk about, but in the end I feel the best way to understand my overflowing emotions towards this song even before watching the film is to listen to it yourself. The one comment I will make it that Thank God Children of the Sea was able to live up to Yonezu&#039;s song, I was quite worried after DAOKO and Yonezu sung the theme for Fireworks (not full title), which ended up as a flop of a film, but I&#039;m glad he wrote for such a good film.<br />
<br />
Final score<br />
If I had to give Children of the Sea a score out of 10, I, personally, would give it a 9/10 as it hit all my good spots but generally give it a 7.5/10 as it&#039;s heavily philosophical and symbolic, which I know peeves quite a few people.

    [b]Story: 2[/b]<br />
 <br />
When the constellations of the sky and the Yin Yang of the Earth converge, you get a $5 Quarter Pounder Combo complimented with a McFlurry of total nonsense.<br />
<br />
There are so many plot holes and flaws with this anime&#039;s message!<br />
<br />
First of all, what happened to Ruka&#039;s handball rival? I&#039;d honestly like to get to know more about her relationship with Ruka.<br />
<br />
Second of all, why were the Americans even remotely relevant? Other than the scene of that old man deleting a 1GB hard-disk of whale ASMR -- in efforts to prevent the USA from stealing Japan&#039;s technology (ugh cliches) -- the USA never seemed to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329924">
        have any impact on the prized possession that they so much value, SUPPOSEDLY.  <br />
<br />
Third of all, the theme of &quot;chasing the secrets of the world&quot; makes this story extremely incomprehensible. I honestly wish for anyone who does this with their lives to <br />
1. Please define what you want to do and think about your consequences, like &quot;I&#039;m going to swimming and in order to not drown, I need nozzles sticking outside the water&quot;. Don&#039;t burn down the whitehouse just because you want to. It&#039;ll get you into a horrible mess like Ruka&#039;s. Look what happened to her! She got pregnant with a sea child and was left drowning in the middle of the Ocean. <br />
<br />
2. Start working on things in life that you take for granted, like money, food, music, or the incredible computational power of your eyes. It&#039;s more fun to do things that will help you grow rather than chasing things that don&#039;t cultivate yourself, unless if you want to get good at long-distance running. <br />
<br />
Yes, going with the flow to find unknown wonders is awesome, but don&#039;t turn a blind eye to reality because of it. I know all stories are supposed to recharge you from reality, but they do not have to right to strip it away from you. You still gotta do you.  <br />
(P.S. I honestly wish there were more animes like &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot; or &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;). <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
<br />
The most beautiful part of all the characters is clearly their skin and 3D movement, which were designed similarly to that of Hanabi (2017), but I was also very intrigued to see layers incorporated into the animation. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not sure what it was called, but I remember Hayao Miyazaki once used to animate oceans by using this machine that placed waves in layers and moved them around. This anime seemed to create a similar effect, and it looked very nice. <br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t really enjoy will-o-wisps tampering with my visuals, but apart from my opinion, I can&#039;t say too many bad things about the art here. It would&#039;ve certainly got a 9/10 if the overall quality of the movie was better.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
I&#039;m surprised Joe Hisaishi scored this anime. I didn&#039;t feel like his tracks stood out as much in this anime as his other masterpieces. <br />
<br />
Character: 2<br />
The premise of this entire anime was about love and friendship.<br />
<br />
** Very Minor Spoilers Below **<br />
So where on earth were the loving adults at? Why are they NEVER TAKING ACTION TO HELP THEIR KIDS? Like Mr.Maasaki, you daughter Ruka is running around like Mary Poppins in a typhoon and all you say is &quot;Oh? She&#039;ll find her way back&quot; and let her hitchhike on a petroleum truck? <br />
<br />
And also, why, just WHY SORA, would you feed Ruka &quot;the world&quot; without her permission. You just gave the entire world, and you expect her to carry it like Atlas? How irresponsible! Look, if you want a girl to be happy and see the world, you don&#039;t literally give her a seed that can destroy her. You take her out to coffee! God... <br />
<br />
Otherwise, the characters were all pretty boring. Umi and Sora acted just like kids, despite having sad backstories (I think people who are like this are trapped in their own depression and never grow. I come from an island, so I see a lot of people like this). Ruka was promising at first (she reminded me of &quot;Hamburger Spike&quot;), but &quot;chasing secrets of the world&quot; really took away her personality, and everyone else&#039;s too, tbh. Everyone seemed to be fighting for with no goals whatsoever. Maybe I&#039;ll be comfortable with the delusion of the characters when I&#039;m older, but definitely not now as a student. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
I enjoyed how delusional this anime was compared to a similar Nagi No Asukara and Cowboy Bebop. <br />
<br />
Overall: 4<br />
I pulled an all-nighter to write a 1500-word essay just 12 hours ago. <br />
So the fact that I wrote a 750-word review on this anime just comes to show how much I despise this anime and its characters, which brings me to the main takeaway of the &quot;Children By the Sea&quot;: The world is 90% Dark Matter <br />
and you can&#039;t fully unfold the world. Please make your children listen to the preceding message and help them make the decision between chasing their passions or becoming &quot;the world&quot; for 20 seconds.

    Studio 4°C is very much a formidable studio in term of animation. Their movies often have a creative art style with realistic character designs and a light cold tone of color choices. Therefore, it&#039;s always a treat watching their works. But sadly, I can&#039;t say that the stories they offered are just as inspiring. And unfortunately, Kaijuu no Kodomo or Children of the Sea, as beautiful as it may look, is not an exception. <br />
<br />
Normally, this will be the part where I&#039;m spoiling the story a little bit to help guiding the viewer into the anime. But this time, the story is just too incomprehensible

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330523">
        or quite frankly, a mess. And I really think that it&#039;s better for you to find out yourselves.<br />
<br />
For the length of a movie, the cast is reasonably rounded and works quite well. We got introduced to the 3 main lead and some minor side characters that doesn&#039;t leave much of an impression. But what I want to talk about is their dialogues, they always sound so vague and as invalid as possible. I figured that maybe the director wanted to remain the mystery to the end but even then, there&#039;s really no answer, no explanations of any kind and that really hangs me over the middle. <br />
<br />
As mentioned above, Kaijuu no Kodomo has one of the best animation I&#039;ve ever seen. As comparable as Ufotable, Kyoani or Ghibli&#039;s works. Everything looks so fluid and beautifully detailed. Especially the characters&#039; eyes and the scenery of the sea, they looks so lively but still remain the uniqueness of animated story. The music is also very reminiscent and bring a lots contribution in the overall tender and mysterious tone of the anime.<br />
<br />
Imo, no matter how great the animation can be, if its story fails to make the same impact, it&#039;s just such a shame because pieces of animation that&#039;s as beautiful as Children of the Sea is so rare to find nowadays. So if you&#039;re all for the story like me, Kaijuu no Kodomo is just not worth it.<br />
<br />

    Kaijuu no Kodomo is a strange movie that I find doesn&#039;t really fit into the typical blockbuster mold. Your enjoyment will come directly from your ability to understand (or at least feel like you understand) what it is trying to say. Basically, you won&#039;t know whether you&#039;ll like or dislike this movie until you watch it, simply because of the experience depending so much on factors outside of the four categories of Story, Art, Sound or Character.<br />
<br />
STORY: The film conveys its messages as unclearly as possible - you might be able to follow what is happening on a surface level, but having an understanding of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316969">
        the symbolism is essential for not being confused at the film&#039;s climax or its conclusion. I was initially confused at what was happening, but as long as you have a working idea as to what the film is trying to say you will be engaged. The film certainly doesn&#039;t shy away from going big, and I was very impressed by the scope and magnitude of what it was trying to say.<br />
<br />
ART: The art in this film is absolutely breathtaking. It&#039;s not your typical anime style - very rough and textured - but it gives each scene a more surreal, yet grounded feel. The fishes feel like they&#039;re actually there. The whales look majestic and mysterious. There were many moments where the animation completely blew me away. Regardless of whether you understand the film or not, the animation makes it worth going to see it.<br />
<br />
SOUND: How they got Joe Hisaishi to do the score, I have no idea. But it&#039;s excellent, as you would expect. The music really builds a sense of scale and epicness that adds to the stellar animation job and gives the story a wholly new dimension. Kenshi Yonezu&#039;s ED, &quot;Umi no Yuurei&quot;, is a beautiful, ethereal song that ends the film off perfectly. I stayed back to listen to the whole thing.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: Ruka&#039;s character arc isn&#039;t really a central part of the film - it&#039;s essentially a by-the-book coming of age story if you look at it in isolation and would only really merit a 5 or 6. What makes the character arc so impressive is how it&#039;s integrated into the film as a whole. Ruka&#039;s character provides the narrative thread that holds the film together while making its forays into more existential questions not feel out of place. That&#039;s why I bumped it up to an 8.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: I enjoyed every second of this movie, particularly trying to figure out what its central message was. Finding the common thread that seemed to tie all of its disparate parts together was the most enjoyable part of the whole experience (as was trying to fit each new scene presented to me into my model). It also helped that the animation was stunning, and that the score was perfect.<br />
<br />
I would recommend anyone to watch Kaijuu no Kodomo. Even the film&#039;s message seems unclear, it&#039;s artistic merits alone are worth giving it a shot.

    This is going to be a very long review of Kaijuu no Kodomo because it is very awesome, hands down, one of the best anime movies that I have seen in my entire life. Even for the people who do not really watch anime, I&#039;m still going to recommend watching this movie. Because for me, this is a masterpiece, with overall 10/10. The review might contain a personal interpretation of this movie, so I would like to apologize or you may correct me if I don&#039;t correctly interpret this movie, especially the message contains within it.<br />
<br />
[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER!]<br />
<br />
STORY 10/10: Firstly, there are a lot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334967">
        of beautiful messages that this movie has delivered and it is being packaged in such a beautiful and poetic manner. For me, there is no scene that has gone to waste, every movement, action, and conversation is the way of the author to build-up the story. I realize when there is an actual connection with the first scene and the very last scene; the conversation between Ruko, Umi, Sora, and Anglade, which discusses the universe, and conversation with other scenes that lead up to something: the connection between human and the universe; that we are bigger than we think because we are connected to the universe. The story of this movie reminds me of Neil deGrasse Tyson&#039;s interview, which he stated: &quot;... It’s not that we are better than the universe, we are part of the universe.  We are in the universe and the universe is in us.” It is superb. Indeed, one might argue there are some plot holes, but I believe the author considers to not include several scenes because it will–somehow–distract the point of the story.<br />
<br />
ART/ANIMATION 10/10: There is no doubt the animation and the art because it really helps the movie to convey the message of this movie. Every movement and action are well-portrayed in this movie. Can you even imagine a scene where the mc putting a can in a plastic bag and grabbing a pile of sand is animated in a very detailed manner and flawless? Even to the extent of reflection of water, movement of the school of fishes, the combination of colors, and other things that you can visibly see. I literally cannot see any weakness in anything related to the art and the animation, because it is so flawless and close to perfection. Truly one of a kind.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS 10/10: Third, the characters, I personally believe the characters have their own important role to deliver the messages within the movie. Even without knowing that Umi and Sora were actually &quot;abused&quot; it needs not to show that they are abused, but there some scenes that have indicated that they have been &quot;abused&quot; by some people in the movie, in my perspective; for instance, then why they are so far away with the crowd and why they do not really mingle along with the people? Even if, one might say that there are some characters that supposed to have more role, but I think the author has the great control of the character development and try to make everything in control and not disrupting the characters to deliver the story from the very first start. Understanding this movie is not like reading academic books, it is like reading philosophical books like Nietzche that are very abstract or like reading a poem that is very thought-provoking and multi-interpretative. It is actually very difficult to deliver the story when there are a lot of various characters with different directions of developments for us to pay attention to, but the author pulled this off by picking which characters&#039; role that need to be emphasized in the movie so the message is well-delivered. That is why the characters in this movie are the best because their roles have successfully delivered the message as aforementioned.<br />
<br />
SOUND 10/10: No doubt with the sound, it is perfection. The sounds definitely help the movie to show which scenes that are intense and which one is not. I don&#039;t have much to say and clarify the sound because it is all perfect as a package.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT 10/10: I watched this in 2020 and I think this is the best anime that I have watched in the past years. I really love thought-provoking animes/movies such as &quot;Waking life (Non-anime)&quot; and &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot;. So I think it is very interesting to watch Kaijuu no Kodomo and definitely will come back to watch it again!<br />
<br />
OVERALL 10/10: Definitely an anime that I will watch it again and again because it really satisfies your eyes, ear, and heart. It needs not to bring you tears but this is still the true definition of perfection in my honest opinion. I totally recommend everyone to watch this movie, and thus, you may share your own opinion and interpretation of this movie! <br />

    I love Children of the Sea. <br />
<br />
I love its saturated palette. Joe Hisaishi’s atmospheric music. Acid-trip cinematography. Sublime art. A surreal plot that will bend your mind to the ends of the universe, but then back again to return perfectly to its origin, where everything settles beautifully.<br />
<br />
This will be a full interpretation of every plot-relevant event. Please use this review as a guide for your own thoughts, rather than a concrete explanation. <br />
<br />
Initially, Ruka is a young girl stranded on an island with the entire Pacific sprawling before her, stranded by her frustrations of growing up and communicating with others.<br />
<br />
She struggles with communicating her feelings

          <span style="display: none;" id="review360398">
        and understanding her own wants. She balls up in anticipation for a long, uneventful summer vacation.<br />
<br />
Soon after, in her father’s aquarium, Ruka meets Umi, a carefree spirit dancing in his own world. He tells her that “things that shine will always be found,” and Ruka is swept up by her fascination and the beauty of the will-o’-wisps, meteors falling from the sky. She clutches to Umi’s hand as he leads her onward, noticing his incredible warmth. <br />
<br />
Umi is a metaphorical representation of Ruka’s connection to others, her own tie to humanity. A physical expression of her desire.<br />
<br />
Umi takes her to meet Sora, his brother. We find out that he is sick, and will soon die. The three of them board the aquarium’s boat on a reckless journey out into the open sea, fueled by Ruka’s aversion to seeing her alcoholic mother, apologizing to the handball team, and frustration with herself.<br />
<br />
Sora is a metaphorical representation of Ruka’s appetition, her curiosity for the unknown.<br />
When Umi takes Ruka’s hands, she feels warmth and fulfilment. When Sora takes Ruka’s hands, he is pulling her into the unforgiving ocean water. <br />
<br />
The sea is omnipresent throughout the movie. The sea, space and the universe are representations of Ruka’s thalassophobic helplessness in a vast and unknowable world. <br />
<br />
After a storm, Sora gets lost and Ruka rides with Umi on a truck to a secluded area where she meets Anglade. Anglade is a marine biologist who isolates himself from society to understand the world around him. <br />
<br />
Anglade asserts that the sea and the space are one and the same, that we are made out of the same substance, and we are connected to people across worlds. There is an inexplicable vastness in the universe; 90% of it is made of dark matter that we can never observe. Yet, Anglade seems to suggest that we should be content in merely experiencing the wonder of creation. Nothing more.<br />
<br />
In a beautiful coalescence of colour, Ruka, Umi and Sora wade through the seawater. Blue plankton light up the world and warmly envelop the trio.<br />
<br />
Ruka wakes up in the middle of the night to a feverish Umi. She is surprised by Sora in the darkness, who leads her to the shore.<br />
<br />
Sora, before he disappears in a streak of light, kisses Ruka and forces her to swallow a meteor. <br />
The meteor is representative of Ruka’s appetition for the unknown. <br />
<br />
For an unknown number of years, Anglade and Jim have attempted to collect data to understand when the “festival” will happen, which will mark the end of the boys’ lifespans. After failing to “save” Sora, Jim deletes his research data and announces that his goals have changed: rather than to prolong the lifespans of Umi and Sora, he now strives to protect them from the interference of arrogant people. Self righteous adults have no place in imposing biases on a child’s self reckoning. <br />
<br />
Ruka, drunken and confused with the meteor inside her, rides out to sea with grandma Dede and Umi, where the former gives a speech about how we can never fully perceive things around us. We can only catch fragments of memories in the wind, as if we were sails. Through these fragments, we come to understand ourselves and the world we live in. <br />
<br />
Ruka dives into the water, driven by her appetition and curiosity. She is swallowed by colossal beings, constantly reminding us of our insignificance in the presence of the sea, and space. She meets Sora again inside a chamber, who tells her that her job is complete. She begins to ascend through space and the universe and the camera pans out to show galaxies, DNA, primitive life forms, and seemingly the fabric of the universe itself. <br />
<br />
Ruka, now a being made of stars, meets a fully material Umi, who drives himself through a shield of flames surrounding her, and grabs the meteor fragment burning in her chest. <br />
<br />
Ruka fights Umi for this fragment, as if to say “Umi, this drive is dangerous, you cannot have it.” Umi and Ruka somersault over each other for the possession of this meteor. In this process, Ruka comes to the realization that she must return to humanity, and this meteor will not allow her to do so. When Umi turns into an infant, in an act of her own volition, Ruka gives this meteor piece to Umi. This action represents her maturity; a willful choice to return to reality, now that her appetition has been sated, her job complete. It is her desire for human connection that brings her to chase Umi’s warmth. The two fall into the sea, and Umi begins to disappear.<br />
<br />
Ruka fights to hold onto fragments of Umi as his body loses materiality. She screams out “Umi, please stay with me,” grasping for his perfect personification of the warmth of love and connection. As the final piece of Umi bursts into a tiny fragment of the universe far away, Ruka, with tears in her eyes, is met with familiar voices: her parents. What is shining will always be found.<br />
<br />
She is pulled out of the sea by her desperately worried folks.<br />
<br />
In a conversation with Dede, Ruka tearily asks why she was chosen for this, and remarks that she wishes to see the boys again. Dede, empathetically tells her that she has experienced a beautiful boy by the sea as well. Dede explains that the journey to maturity is a path that all humans trek at some point in their life. “The most important things cannot be conveyed with words.” Ruka, having received solidarity from Dede, and a newfound trust in herself, runs forward into her life with a newfound spring in her step. <br />
<br />
Some time in the future, Ruka sloshes through crystalline waves on a golden beach. Under the gaze of the clouds, she is content to kiss the beauty of the everyday. Perhaps longing for days past, she looks toward the horizon where the blues are blurred and recalls an unforgettable time with those who changed her life.<br />

    Children of the Sea&#039;s high commitment to pretty nonsense, both visually and thematically, results in an unsatisfying viewing experience.<br />
<br />
Children of the Sea might be worth watching for the sheer verve of its occasionally <br />
resplendent visuals. The raw, complex lineart gives the depictions a real sense of texture, and the shear density of the aquatic wildlife in the frame is impressive. Much of that wildlife is rendered using CG, but it is generally integrated pretty well enough so that way that the high fidelity of the CG art contrasts with the more impressionistic traditional art reads as an artistic flourish. However, integration of CG is much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354976">
        less successful during the myriad of cuts with extremely dynamic cameras moving through highly detailed 3d environments.<br />
<br />
The storytelling is pleasingly sedate, if extremely unfocused. I liked the relationship between the three lead children - the burgeoning friendship between the female lead and the younger brother and the significantly more antagonistic relationship between the female lead and the older brother.<br />
<br />
However, this story is frequently sidelined as characters that are barely introduced murmur about a &quot;festival&quot; (the aesthetic vagueness of their exposition does not make it any less clunky). They then wax lyrical about how the expansiveness of the universe relates to the interior of mankind or something, which is preposterous and burns time that could be better spent developing the characters and conflict. The fixation on pretty sounding nonsense also comes at the expense of following through on the existing plot elements (Why were the children rescued off screen? What happened to the pointless science team subplot?) which frustrates the film&#039;s own efforts to establish a sense of grounded magical realism.<br />
<br />
This culminates in a deeply surreal climax. The presumed life or death stakes for the characters caught in the middle of the &quot;festival&quot; are way too abstract and vague for the storytelling to land with any visceral impact - even in the face of all of the intense and captivating visuals.<br />
<br />
Music pieces are great individually, but sometimes seems poorly timed with the pacing of the shot to shot editing.

    What an absolute spectacle. This is the sort of film that gently draws you in by the hand, stroking you with gentle breezes, lapping at your bare toes as the distant calls of whales echo by your ears. <br />
<br />
And then proceeds to faceplant you into the sand and screech like a dying seagull as you hallucinate from a lack of oxygen. <br />
<br />
For the first hour of the film I was completely hooked! Ruka, Umi and Sora are familiar but enjoyable archetypes, and no time is wasted in building a bond between the trio and getting into the mystery. The side characters have next to no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review380682">
        focus, but they work into the setting well enough to not take away from the story. And, of course, with every frame being pure eye candy, you easily lose yourself to the world and watch the plot flow with the waves...until the plot begins to lose you.<br />
<br />
Am I an idiot? Did I miss all the obvious hints and signs because I was too caught up in the gorgeous scenery and facial expressions? Totally possible. Most likely. Did I genuinely attempt to follow every hint and sign? For sure. And yet there I sit, taking in the second hour of the film, jaw dropped because the sights and sounds are all I can follow, and even that loses any sense of direction in the final half an hour. It does sort of tie bits and pieces together at the end, but certainly not enough for me to ponder what I just saw. <br />
<br />
I can see the direction the story was going, and what it was asking the viewers to explore. There are elements of fantastical and philosophical proportions that do offer decent speculations - but certainly not enough to hold a story together. If that was the point - if the story should be taking a backseat to the visuals, then that&#039;s fine! I&#039;m all for a pure spectacle, but I want to know I&#039;m only getting a spectacle. Don&#039;t build up a story just to toss me into a lecture on the existence of man and memories. I&#039;m just not smart enough, y&#039;all -_-<br />
<br />
Looking for a sensory overload? &quot;Children of the Sea&quot; will mesmerize you with its top tier visuals and great voice acting. If there is any, ANY way, turn the voices down, turn off subtitles, and just take it the sights and sounds. Otherwise, stick with the Ghibli films for a satisfying blend of storytelling and beautiful animation, because the most you&#039;ll get from these children is a headache.<br />
<br />
A pretty one, though XD

    this is my first review so sorry if there&#039;s a mistake. <br />
<br />
POSSIBLY LITTLE SPOILER<br />
<br />
Art-10<br />
In my opinion this movie has an art of indulging eyes throughout the scene presented with a details view on the beach and ocean as well as subtle movements in animatio so, no complaints in this art style. <br />
<br />
Music-10<br />
as well as the music that accompanies the story during a sea diving scene or when a character experiences something magical in this story, a background sound that really matches all scenes. I give a 10/10 score on music.<br />
<br />
Voice acting-8 (I hate the father, lol)<br />
while for voice acting there are no problems. All actors

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344254">
        match the characters being played. except for one, the main character&#039;s father who will later be explained below.<br />
<br />
Character-7 (Is because side characters)<br />
all three protagonists have different personalities who are friends. The main character is said to have mischievous behavior that often acts at will and also she hates her mother, for some reason is not told why she hates her mother in the movie, even so throughout the story, we will see the development of this girl who will change throughout the story. While the other two protagonists are cheerful children who accompany the main character. This movie taught me about what friendship is and why it is valuable. That&#039;s what makes me like these three characters, because they help each other and get through the fun and sadness together. Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about the main character&#039;s father who was very bland, he didn&#039;t have the characteristics in this story as well his voice acting, for example when his daughter wanted to go to the beach during a storm he was the only one who didn&#039;t panic while the mother  who does not look useful is only showed her feelings, unfortunately, this father  has an empty role until the end of the movie, applause for the mother.<br />
<br />
while for supporting characters such as the teenager and weird grandmother, their origins are not conveyed and why they are involved in the story so for supporting characters is very worse. While some other institutions in the story that might look like a bad guys are also not told what they are planning.<br />
<br />
Story-2<br />
the story in this movie is very ordinary and even confusing, in the beginning to the middle I enjoyed the story, until the end of the story will be a common thing for most anime in general. I can not tell because of spoilers. Honestly, maybe the story in this film is too hasty so it does not explain the details of what happened. <br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
maybe the art and ost in this movie is great but the story is meh.<br />
<br />
This anime is suitable for you who are : <br />
People who only care about unique art style, hachi&#039;s fans, People who are bored during pandemic and have free time.<br />
<br />
This anime is NOT suitable for you who are : <br />
People who care about the storyline, those who hate lazy storylines.<br />

    This movie was... interesting. This is a short review of the movie I watched, and here are the ratings:<br />
<br />
STORY: 5/10<br />
The story was decent the first hour, but after that, a lot of weird things started happening, and I still can not figure out what they were trying to tell. If you were to ask me about what the plot was then for the first hour I would say: &quot;Whale is having a party and is inviting people, including some special kids.&quot; while for the other hour of the movie, I can honestly only say: &quot;Ruka is all over the place while yelling &quot;Umi-kun!&quot; every 5

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330294">
        minutes or so. <br />
<br />
ART: 11/10<br />
The art and animation style of this movie is so different from your normal animes. Everything looks stunning and everything constantly sparkles and moves. I have honestly never seen animation this good before, and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever do it again either.<br />
The climax of the animation is definetly the last 30 minutes of the movie, and allthough I never knew what or why the hell everything is happening, it at least looked incredible. Out of this world, insane.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 10/10<br />
Sound was also some of the best I&#039;ve heard, and it definetly sprinkled on some quality together with the animation. I honestly don&#039;t know what more to say about, exept incredible!<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 7/10<br />
Allthough I didn&#039;t understand what the hell was going on half of the time, I do have to say that the animation alone makes this worthy of watching, try to ignore the second half of the story and just enjoy it for its outstanding sound and animation, if you&#039;re more of a story prefering person, then I&#039;d not reccomend it, but in the end it&#039;s up to you. <br />
<br />
OVERALL: 7/10

    From the everyday, to the simple, to the surreal and eccentric, visually and audibly - Kaijuu no Kodomo was absolutely artistically stunning. The artistic visuals and beautifully composed music was the best part of the film. These two elements blended seamlessly to create such a vibrant and well-designed world, with use of colour and music really visualising different tones and environments perfectly. <br />
<br />
Ultimately though, Kaijuu no Kodomo was slightly disappointing. Leading up to this film&#039;s release in my country, I was pretty excited and anticipating a similar enjoyment to the first time I ever watched films like Wolf Children or Your Name. With their stunning

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323779">
        artistic styles and soundtracks, I was expecting Kaijuu no Kodomo to join these two fantastic films in glory. Unfortunately it did not. <br />
<br />
What this film lacks in comparison is in its story-telling. With an almost hyper-focus on the stunning artistic visual and sound design of this film, what gets left behind is the capacity to tell a story effectively. The pacing was uneven, and the events were never really explained or developed in ways that could actively engage me in the story of the film itself. I found myself greatly anticipating the animation and visual aspects more, rather than the events that unfolded. It felt messy and it ended messy.<br />
<br />
The characters were all played effectively, with no particular issues or key moments that arose. The voice actors all performed well for what they were given. <br />
<br />
Overall, it was a beautiful piece of artwork but just a mediocre film.

    NO SPOILERS &lt;3<br />
<br />
As someone who works at a movie theater and has seen the ad for this movie only about a million times, I was excited to finally sit down and watch this movie that has been on &quot;my list&quot; on Netflix for a long time, but I have to say I was a little disappointed. To preface, I have not read the source material and I watched the English dub, which I thought was decent. Or at least the dubbing matches the monotone dialogue of the film.<br />
<br />
STRENGTHS: The art style is incredibly unique and beautiful. A solid 10/10, besides the fact the eyes were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403630">
        accidental jump scares to me at a couple points in the film lmao. I really thought most of the character designs were nice too despite the faces perhaps lacking in expression once animated. What it lacks in somewhat rough movements at parts, it more than makes up for with creative and fluid animation sequences at many parts of the film that are extremely rich, vivid, and pleasing to the eye to watch. The sound design with underwater noises and such I thought were really nice and the musical score I thought was good too, although I found it to be a little repetitive by the end, but perhaps it was because I was becoming bored with the action.<br />
- ART, SOUND, CHARACTER DESIGNS<br />
<br />
WEAKNESSES: I found the pacing of the movie to be off and startling. The beginning of the movie intrigued me setting up the main character as a realistic, human character and introducing an interesting premise showcasing a boy who was raised by the sea with a mysterious brother. However, by climax of the movie, I found myself feeling totally lost and confused as to how we ended up here. The movie completely ended up in a different direction than I expected; which is actually something I love in a movie, besides the fact that the climax felt... weird? confusing? impossible to follow? It is hard to put into words.<br />
<br />
In general, I think the biggest issue I have with this movie is that it feels superficial or as though it is trying to impart some grand message, but it kind of just comes off as just &quot;life is everywhere, the universe, wow&quot; and it makes you wonder, &quot;okay, and? what is the point of this?&quot; It was hard for me to take it seriously.<br />
- PACING, THEME, AIMLESS STORY<br />
<br />
Maybe I just have a smooth brain and there is some grand message to be found in this movie, but the story and theme of the movie falls flat to me. Besides this, the visual intrigue alone and the enjoyment you feel watching this movie is not bad at all and I&#039;d recommend it to a friend. It was at least thought-provoking.

    So...<br />
This movie was a ride to say the least. I walked into this expecting what I read in the synopsis, but the synopsis did NOT prepare me for what I actually viewed. <br />
<br />
Story- 4<br />
It was going just fine in the beginning; there were fish, oceans, kids talking about a ghost of the sea, just as the synopsis said. But then, that all changed. I tried to understand what was actually happening and catch the meaning, but from that whale consumption scene to end of the movie, all I picked up was...METEOR, THE MEANING OF LIFE, BIRTH... THE UNIVERSE!!! I couldn&#039;t follow along then. <br />
<br />
Art- 9<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330385">
        animation was beautiful. The ocean scenes, the fish, the rain illusions especially. The camera movements through me off a little at certain scenes, but overall, it was amazing.<br />
<br />
Sound- 9<br />
I didn&#039;t focus on the music too much in this one, but it was very soothing. I enjoyed what I listened to throughout the entire movie.<br />
<br />
Character- 4<br />
No development to speak of, I couldn&#039;t really read anyone, and there isn&#039;t anything else to discuss.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 6<br />
I did enjoy this for the most part. I wasn&#039;t bored and it DEFINITELY kept me intrigued...but it did swim squares around me.<br />
<br />
Overall- 6<br />
This movie was something. I liked what I was given and this is something I think would be a good watch for movie night, mainly to see the faces of those who don&#039;t know what&#039;s coming. But honestly... I felt like I was on drugs while watching this.

    Children of the Sea presents a story that is very metaphorical and is something that should be appreciated for its visual presentation. The quality of this anime film is rather inconsistent. I loved some scenes and was generally amazed by the effort put into the most important scenes, but other scenes just felt rushed and lazily done. The story is really metaphorical, so if you are the kind of person to turn your brain off while watching films, don&#039;t watch this film. You will be bored. However, if you are the type to analyse a film while watching it and after watching it while digesting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312112">
        the plot of the film you just watched, then this might be the film for you.<br />
<br />
Some things are animated rather sloppily, but for the most part, the animation is pretty decent. There is a scene that goes on for quite some time that is quite hypnotic. That was the peak of the animation quality and I loved it. It&#039;s rather hard to explain the animation without going into spoilers so just sit back and let the film take you on a journey.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack, sound effects, and voice acting are all spectacular in this film. These really complemented the animation and overall story. It&#039;s unfortunate that character development was rather poor. The film spends almost all of its time focussing on the three main characters. It pretty much doesn&#039;t develop the relationship Ruka has with her parents. Any shift with the relationships with Ruka and her parents and the relationship between her mother and father, which happens in this film, feels rather jarring since there is a lack of backstory and character development to show how they got to that point and why their relationship is unstable and changing. I wasn&#039;t invested in the supporting characters. They weren&#039;t given enough depth to have anything to care about.<br />
<br />
I did enjoy this film and appreciated the metaphorical aspect of it. Just beware of the poor character development. Don&#039;t expect a masterpiece or anything significantly good when watching this film.<br />
<br />
Watched at Hoyts Entertainment Quarter 15 as part of the Sydney Film Festival.

    Best art I&#039;ve ever seen in a movie. Every frame is beautiful and the animation is extremely fluid. The only drawback to this movie is that the story lost me a bit especially at the end and the way it tried to wrap it up. Something about the birth of the Universe and being connected to the sea with some festival. <br />
<br />
The characters also felt very dull. There&#039;s clearly some drama introduced that got placed at the backend or resolved very quickly/abruptly so more time could be put to showcase the more surrealistic parts. Because of that there isn&#039;t really a satisfying ending and left

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330039">
        me somewhat confused. But I would keep that in mind and still recommend watching just for the art, just don&#039;t expect too much from the story.

    a breathtaking dream. this was what the movie felt like to me.<br />
<br />
first quarter of the movie was pretty simple. *first quarter*. you have your main character ruka who is struggling with her relationships both at home and at school. she goes to her father&#039;s workplace, the aquarium, a place she&#039;s always took interest and peace in and she meets an energetic boy there, umi. she quickly learns that umi isn&#039;t exactly &quot;normal&quot; as apparently he was found with his brother, sora in a beach and was said to be raised by dugong&#039;s so they had to be in water a lot.<br />
<br />
things started to go from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387217">
        1 to a 50 to a 100 to a full fucking thousand after that. it went from kids and the ocean to meteors, a sea festival, to quantum shit, to the full fucking universe. crazy shit. didnt understand a single thing after that first quarter but it was still an incredible experience. the art is gorgeous and i think we can all agree on that. there was a few cgi used which i usually hate but it didnt bother me at all here. every scene is absolutely stunning. from the big important events to little  scenes. complemented by beautiful, fun, and exciting soundtracks that just makes the experience of watching this movie even more amazing. truly wonderful.<br />
<br />
i think i could&#039;ve given this a 9 if i understood shit more but my braindead head was just not made for this lmao i also didn&#039;t feel any incredible character/personality presentation, though i think i Could if i paid more attention. there are also a lot of symbolism in this movie which i wish i would&#039;ve paid more attention to as i only realised that now<br />
<br />
overall experience was great. didnt understand half of the shit while watching and still dont now but it was still great. and like i said, it was like a dream. a confusing weird and enjoyable dream which ill still be thinking about for a few days now.

    Out of 100 Nobles watching…<br />
83 were impressed!<br />
10 would have liked more dialogue and substance from the books<br />
7 had minor complaints about the visuals<br />
<br />
Kaijuu no Kodomo is one of my favorite Manga and was quite possibly the impetus to me writing reviews about media I consume. I made a MAL account because of manga like Kaijuu and Made in Abyss and I really couldn’t believe that something that felt as obscure as this got a full movie adaptation. In my eternal struggle with Studio 4°c I was hesitant to pick this one up, but after seeing the official AMV I determined if the movie was poopy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368703">
        at least we got a great single and music video out of the ordeal. Pleasantly to my surprise Studio 4°c seemed to hit a good mix with this one and I found this movie to be “good enough”.<br />
<br />
The visuals were overall a gorgeous adaptation of the inky realistic style from the original work. The animators worked a perfect stylistic adaptation of stills from the manga over the 3d scenes with only a few cg turtles and odd tracking sequences breaking immersion. Say what you want about their work but I feel like the studio really give it their all for each property they get their hands on. <br />
<br />
The sound work was also excellent. Whale sounds, loud booms, and tasty synth vocals were all great creating an experience deserving of the original work. Despite the beautiful additions of the audio element, I do feel that the story perhaps worked best in a purely visual format.<br />
<br />
The story was glacially slow, and a lot was left out. Characters like the oceanographer Jim had a much bigger role in the book and without the long narration from supporting characters like him and side stories between chapters the viewer is left in perfect empathy with Ruka when she says at the end of the film “I didn’t understand anything”.<br />
<br />
I feel sorry for any average viewer who went to this film in theatre’s expecting a “Your Name”, “Koe no Katachi”, or a Ghibli film. Without the context from the already relatively sparse manga dialogue this film probably will only appeal to the “arthouse” types. Still, I am one such individual and fishy fun will always be in my wheelhouse. Watch this movie. It’s pretty good, but more importantly purchase yourself a copy of the Manga.<br />
