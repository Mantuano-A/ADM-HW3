    Ah, Blood. To put it basically it was animes equivalent of Buffy the vampire slayer. Starting off from the fairly decent Blood: The Last Vampire movie and then moving on to the mediocre but well received Blood+ series. And then our dear old Clamp decided to try a hand at giving the blood series a new look. Enter Blood-c, a name which gave me a bad feeling from the get go. A series which suffered from abysmal storytelling, over-exaggerated gore which looked more comical than disturbing, characters with little likability and it says a lot when you can say that half the series can be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review88841">
        skipped without anything significant being lost.<br />
<br />
Now we have Blood-c The Last Dark, a title which still makes no sense even after having seen the film. So let me answer the first question you have. Is it better than the tv anime series? Honestly, yes it is. But considering the quality of the tv series that isn&#039;t really something hard to accomplish. Despite that it still remains a poor film. Starting with story. Much like the tv series, a large amount of the film feels like padding. We are treated to a familiar vampire fight on a train which in turn causes Saya to meet the members of a a group called &quot;Surat&quot; which happen to be teenagers.(Naturally) From this moment on the plot progression comes to a complete halt. For well over forty minutes we are shown mainly the overly out of place comical characters of Surat. But then plot kicks in gear again and remembers what it&#039;s supposed to be focusing on and we are treated to an action scene and really that&#039;s about it. This supposedly inspires one of the members of Surat to get their ass in gear and direct Saya to the end boss. (Which apparently is a building that nobody can find despite it being clearly viewable from the coast of the city.) From that point on all the characters of Surat are rendered completely worthless. They don&#039;t appear again except for the epilogue and they don&#039;t effect the plot in any way. The finale is rather disappointing and anti-climatic. I had hoped that the writer would have learned from the tv series that twists that come out of nowhere for shock value is not good storytelling. Apparently they didn&#039;t. It really says a lot when they take the time to create a giant monster which in turn is defeated in a single strike within moments. Overall a large amount of the story feels unnecessary and plot points such as the curfew placed on minors are dropped with little explanation or exploration. <br />
<br />
I  cannot say the art was bad. However I can say I was underwhelmed by it. If you were keeping an eye on anime news then you would know that this movie received a grant from the government so there was no reason they couldn&#039;t go all out with the animation. Still I didn&#039;t see anything truly impressive. Honestly the quality was similar to that our the currently ongoing psycho pass in my opinion. This is just speculation but either all that cash went into the characters exaggerated reactions and cg or it might be the reason Production I.G has seen a sudden increase of productivity with anime series.<br />
<br />
Sounds is something I can&#039;t comment on as I didn&#039;t take much notice of it. Though if I had to derive an opinion based on my watch I would deem it forgettable.<br />
<br />
Characters are something of an oddity. Saya has traded her annoying bubbly carefree personality from the tv series for a more stereotypical broody cold type. There really is not much to say about it. Our main antagonist is a jumbled mess. Mainly because he has little to no focus in the film at all. He appears briefly at the beginning, briefly at the middle and then at the end. So his motivations remain confusing and nonsensical. The rest of our characters is where the movie spends most of it&#039;s time with which to me is rather odd way of using your limited time. This is because of the pointlessness of these characters to the main story. The members of Surat hold no purpose in the story besides two instances of telling her &quot;Go here to find Fumito&quot; and justifying a silly twist at the end. In retrospect that time spent developing them could have been better used to develop our two main characters seeing as they are the ones effecting the actual story and most need fleshing out. Also I really need to point out again just how out of place these Surat members are. They act much like characters in a sitcom and clash greatly with the atmosphere of the story itself. You can&#039;t exactly show us Saya killing a monster brutally and expect us to brush that off and enjoy comic relief. On that note, a loli learning to type on a keyboard with her feet is the most ridiculous thing I have seen. I mean even someone who isn&#039;t that into computers can tell you that not many computers allow you to use two keyboards at the same time, also no computer lets you type into two windows simultaneously. So that really makes typing with your feet a pointless skill. <br />
<br />
Really I feel sad for the blood series. If only a competent writer was hired then maybe something great or at least fairly enjoyable could have came out of Blood-C. But here I am watching an hour and forty minute film with a bored look on my face

    IG and CLAMP definitely had the potential to turn this trainwreck of a series around for the better. The finished product? Nothing but bitter disappointment about how a great piece, Blood: The Last Vampire, could be turned into this. <br />
<br />
The issues definitely begin in the characterisation. Nobody is interesting. There is no emotional attachment to any of the struggles they go through, and we &#039;care&#039; because the movie tells us to. Fumito definitely had the potential to be a remotely decent villain, but even there we are let down.<br />
<br />
The animation is mixed, but overall it is fairly negative. Much similar to the series Blood-C, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89871">
        majority of art enjoyment comes from the monster design - and while a lot of what appeared is clearly rehashed from Blood+ and the entire Blood series (if you dare group them together), it is still the high point. For the remainder of the scenes, the animation is carefully guised to look pretty with that distinct I.G. style, but with some inspection the flaws are gaping. The CGI scene? Lets not go there.<br />
<br />
The plot itself made no real sense. The concept was clear, but the whys and hows of it were significantly lacking. There is no resolution, or even understanding, of the events that transpire and why we should be interested in them. Watanuki appears simply as CLAMP fanservice, in a drawn-out sequence which was really unnecessary. <br />
<br />
Blood-C has concluded to be a trainwreck of a project. With I.G. having input, one would have hoped for a return to the glory days of Blood: The Last Vampire. However the final project is nothing short of ridiculous, and while it is a definite improvement from the series it is still not cutting remotely close to average.

I&#039;d like to firstly recommend everyone to watch the Blood-C specials because they summon up the series really well. The specials go straight to the point without leaving behind important information. The feeling you get after watching it will help you when you watch the movie directly afterwards.<br />
Ofcourse if you saw the series then even better. I saw it as well, yet bcs it has been so long since, I watched the specials and it helped me remember every feeling.<br />
<br />
Do you know how it feels to be betrayed and lied to? Have you ever hated yourself for what you believe happend because of you?<br />
Try to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review94359">
        picture it. Try to stand in her shoes. <br />
<br />
I admit that in the series her character may be very annoying, hell even I thought so at times. But in the movie they made up for it.<br />
Some say there is no character development, well I think they&#039;re wrong.<br />
<br />
In the beginning of the movie Saya is cold, you can&#039;t blame her after what happened. Gradually she changes yet stays herself.<br />
Whats diffrent? She found someone like her. No, not a &#039;monster&#039; but a person.<br />
That person as well changes into a stronger someone because of the person&#039;s encounter with Saya.<br />
<br />
Saya seeks for revenge but in the end is it really as she thought it was?<br />
<br />
Watch the movie to find out what happened in the end. Find out the truth behind all these masks. //Nothing is as it seems.\\ <br />
<br />
-Sound-<br />
<br />
Overal the sound was alright actually. It wasn&#039;t wrongly added in a disturbing way. They mainly added it where it was needed for the tension. <br />
So overal a 8/10 for me.<br />
<br />
-Art-<br />
<br />
aaah Clamp and IG did an amazing job as is expected, definetly a 9 out of 10.<br />
The animation is beautifully done and the monsters I have to say are discustingly amazing!! <br />
The exesive use of blood is indeed still there but hey once you start it off like that, why not finish ;D<br />
<br />
-Story-<br />
<br />
The movie actually has a great story and it goes straight to the point: her revenge.<br />
<br />
As for the title: &quot;The Last Dark&quot;, I think they actually explained that in the end of the movie when Fumito &#039;explains&#039; a few things about Saya.<br />
So be sure to look out for that :D<br />
<br />
In the end I give the movie an 8,5 out of 10.

    Blood-C maybe a distant memory for some (and for some they would love to forget) but what this movie has done has really blown me away. In short it reminded me of the emotions, the power of music and that top quality art, of what has made the blood franchise what it is.<br />
<br />
As we go back to memory lane, the Saya we all knew in Blood-C has returned into a distant cold and direct character with one mission. To take down Fumito.  The way her character has changed makes her alike with all the other Saya&#039;s in the sense that deep down in that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review88605">
        cold self there is still a heart beating in their vampire-selves. <br />
Just like in the animated Blood-C series, the continuation of Clamp references amuses those who are familiar with it and of course the return of Watanuki in his lovely shop attending to Saya&#039;s services. <br />
<br />
The new characters within the movie has a very lovely chemistry between them, and creates a nice light-hearted atmosphere amongst the dark and eerie of what the movie is mainly about.  Mana and her backstory and character development alongside Saya&#039;s struggling journey was nicely added just like how Kuroto was added to set the scene for Saya&#039;s meet up with Fumito. <br />
<br />
In short, just like the blood-c series, the twists are there, and are full of impact. But in all honesty, don&#039;t let what the blood-c series became deter you from watching the movie. The movie outshines all that was of that series and really brings back what has made the blood franchise a masterpiece.<br />

    Honestly, before watching Blood-C: The Last Dark I had no familiarity with the franchise. Sure, I saw a couple of episodes of Blood+ on TV, but that’s all, so the only reason for me to watch this film was that my friends invited me to a convention, and it was shown there. And this film turned out to be crap. I decided to write this review but delayed submitting it for two months before I finally got a chance to marathon the Blood-C television series to get a better grasp of the plot. And guess what, now I think that the film is even more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review82530">
        of crap than I initially assumed, therefore, I’m submitting this review mostly unchanged.<br />
<br />
The setting of the film is undetailed and lazy. The creators are trying to bring a dystopian feel to it: Japan is ruled by a corrupted government, the Internet is heavily censored, and underage people are not allowed to stay late on the streets without any adults accompanying them. However, it is never stated why the things are this way. How did the political situation change and why is the government trying to restrict the freedom? Y’see, censorship is like outright speaking “We have stuff we don&#039;t want you to know”, and there are a lot of much better ways to hide the truth. Like spreading rumours, gossips and crazy theories that will make actual facts look like yet another lunatic fantasy, for example. The only reason we have this setting clumsily established is that the writers wanted to introduce the good guys as a resistance, freedom fighters trying to overthrow oppressive and unjust regime, and it hurts how uncreative and forced this is.<br />
<br />
And yeah, those freedom fighters… Here, have a look at this roster: a crippled mentor type of a guy in a wheelchair; his secretary; a tough-acting guy and his geeky friend, our comedic relief duo; and a token loli, who is a also a hacker. They’re clichéd as much as most secondary characters are, so they’re neither really interesting nor irritating. Excluding the loli one, and let me explain why. She is a hacker so good that she actually uses two keyboards simultaneously and types on the second one with her feet. Y’know, there is an anime called Battle Programmer Shirase, the protagonist of which is, well, a programmer and he can move his fingers so fast that he has to use six keyboards to keep up with his speed. This is stupid, but in insanely awesome kind of way. And loli typing with her feet? No, that’s just dumb. There can be a thin line between these two examples of ridiculous anime stuff, but I stand my ground here.<br />
<br />
So, the plot. Meet our protagonist, Saya. If you haven’t watched the Blood-C television series, all you’re going to know about her is that she wants revenge for some unclear reason. She wants to kill Nanahara Fumito, a powerful man who has big influence in Japan. Saya accidentally runs into Hiiragi Mana, a resistance member I haven’t mentioned earlier, during the attack of a vampire monster kind of thingie in an underground train. Saya saves Hiiragi from the monster and escapes from the police with the help of Hiiragi’s resistance friends. Then Saya meets up with Mogari Kuroto (mentor guy in a wheelchair) and learns that they have a common goal as resistance wants to end Nanahara’s oppressive rule. Also, Mogari has some personal feud with Nanahara, so he is just as fuelled up with revenge as Saya.<br />
<br />
As you can see, the opening of the story is pretty generic. However, it’s packed with action scenes and I have to admit that those are pretty good. They are well animated (putting aside my personal hate for CG vehicles), exciting and thrill inducing. The beginning of the film is really fun to watch on the big screen. But when the story slows down a bit… Oh, boy.<br />
<br />
First of all, Saya and Hiiragi. As I have already mentioned, Saya wants revenge. That’s her whole character and it’s uninteresting. On the other hand, Hiiragi is her opposite. While Saya is cold and introverted, Hiiragi is cheerful and friendly. While Saya wants to kill the antagonist, Hiiragi wants to find her father (a plot thread that ends in a rather pathetic but nevertheless amusing way). When these two are talking, it’s painful to listen to because it always follows “Hiiragi is trying to make friends, Saya doesn’t give a thing” formula. This routine gets old very fast and eats up a big chunk of the film.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the plot. It quickly deteriorates and stops making sense. I can turn a blind eye on some things because there is always a possibility that I don’t understand them due to my unfamiliarity with the franchise, but there are still a lot of moments when the stuff happening on screen is illogical, confusing or just pure bosh. I especially like how the film treats hackers as if it’s still the Nineties, when people believed that if one smashes buttons hard enough, he will break a card reader lock wirelessly with his mobile phone. Also, there is a cameo appearance by a character from another CLAMP work, but needless to say, this cameo is utterly pointless.<br />
<br />
The last fight is disappointing, to say the least. And the ending of the story is… I have no words to describe it. When the film ended, I found myself sitting in the middle of a cinema driven to a nonplus and feeling irritated and angry. A lot of plot threads are unresolved, and after watching the TV series I can say that the writers didn’t even bother to explain or address any loose ends left hanging in it.<br />
<br />
As a result, The Last Dark is a bad film. It’s bad if you haven’t watched the TV series because the film’s plot is confusing and makes no sense. And it’s even worse if you did watch the series because the film still makes no god damn sense and doesn’t fill the gaps in its prequel. There is only one redeeming quality in it: action scenes. The director, Shiotani Naoyoshi-shi, is quite good and knows his deal (you can check out currently airing Psycho-Pass series to see what he is capable of, when a competent writer is aboard). Thus, if you want a mindless eye candy kind of a film, The Last Dark can pass as your choice; otherwise, well, excuse me.

    After waiting a good 8 months to finally watch this all I can really say was I wasn&#039;t dispointed at all. <br />
Blood-c was absolutely horrible and it was one of clamps worst anime&#039;s. I&#039;ve always been a big fan of the Blood franchise but, Clamp really had no clue what they were doing. Until I watched the movie.<br />
They put all the missing pieces together, I know understand why the Anime was crappy and not the movie because, they didn&#039;t know how to put it together tell the very end.<br />
It was a very very good movie that I will watch again, I cried and laughed. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89881">

:) Good job clamp (Another masterpiece)

    The infamous Blood-C series, a show that had somewhat good potential, and threw out, I wouldn&#039;t say trash, but something that people wouldn&#039;t normally really like to a great extent. I myself am an avid fan of the series, and I had been anticipating the release of this movie for quite sometime now. I went in not expecting much, and I got what I was expecting. While it wasn&#039;t very bad, it wasn&#039;t a very impressive movie to watch. I would say, around the above average mark, maybe even good. This is my first review.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
As we continue along the journey of Saya seeking her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review88415">
        revenge against Fumito, we encounter a group of hackers known as SIRRUT who are fighting against Fumito and his government regime. In terms of overall story, it was a bit mediocre and I didn&#039;t really understand what was going on (NO literally. I watched the movie RAW, and my limited Japanese only enabled me to understand just a strand of what was actually going on. I will update this review once I fully understand what is going on in the events of the movie) <br />
Though, the story is kind of split between Saya and Mana, Saya wanting revenge against Fumito, and Mana wanting to find the whereabouts of her father. There are some twists, I guess, from what I could analyze, but nothing really extraordinary. As expected from a Blood-C title, don&#039;t expect much from it. The one thing it was lacking was the relationship with the Elder Bairns. Hardly any made a debut in the movie, and it felt as if this aspect of the story was somewhat forgotten. Also, the ending was extensively anti-climactic, and it left me with the same feeling that I had when I finished Fate/Zero, unpleased.  It was quite unfortunate, especially since it had such great potential as a whole; but sadly, you can&#039;t do much with just one writer coming up with all this stuff without any peer criticism to improve.<br />
<br />
Art: 10 <br />
Honestly, I think the reason why Production IG only had one writer working on the story for this movie was because they had used up all their money to hire artists because the art for Blood-C, the TV series and the Last Dark is spectacular. If it is one thing that Blood-C is noteworthy for, it&#039;s the gorgeously detailed art and choreography. It even tops titles known for its high art quality such as Fate/Zero and Hellsing: Ultimate in my opinion. Every looks extensively crisp, and every movement is realistic and noteworthy. The only thing I asked for more of was fighting scenes. Throughout the movie, there were only three major fighting scenes, and the last one was a somewhat unpleasing and lazy. But I can&#039;t blame them; making something as detailed as that does take up time and money, so I understand why they made it short. This movie is a crowning achievement in where the anime market of today should be heading towards in terms of art quality, except, with a better story and a cast of characters that can match the story better. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
Sound wasn&#039;t outstanding, though, there were a few tracks from the OST that I very much so enjoyed because they gave a sense of tension and suspense. But again, there was nothing overly flashy about it. I&#039;ve noticed, that in a few scenes, they would play a suspenseful song in the absence of actually suspense, and some of the OST seems a bit light, taking away from the shows serious premise. Voice acting was very good, I have nothing to complain here as they do have many notable seiyuu&#039;s, Nana Mizuki, Kana Hanazawa, and Jun Fukuyama doing a great job expressing the personality of each characters through voice. <br />
<br />
Characters: 6<br />
The characters seemed a bit... out of place. They weren&#039;t terrible characters, and they were all unique in their own different way. They seemed out of place because, they were very comical despite the seriousness of the show. I can tell that they tried to add a sense of comic relief, but it just didn&#039;t work because there was too much of it, especially from the duo Shun and Matsuo. I felt that the story was more centric on the members of SIRRUT, especially Mana, rather than Saya herself. The main villains also hardly made appearances, Yuuka especially.  Fumito only made a handful of appearances in total, and Kuuto I had no idea where they got him from. <br />
There was also a developing lesbian relationship between Mana and Saya, which I have mixed feelings about. Saya does seem like the lesbian type of person, but when analyzing Saya Kisaragi in the TV series, it is a very big change from being asexual, to bisexual. Though the characters could have been much better, they weren&#039;t completely forgettable, I mean, who can&#039;t forget cute little Hiro Tsukiyama and her Alice in Wonderland/typing with both feet at 100WPM (Not to mention she&#039;s voiced by Kana Hanazawa) cuteness?<br />
<br />
Overall Enjoyment: 7<br />
Though the Blood-C series isn&#039;t something to be of a noteworthy anime, it still does have it&#039;s crowning achievements in displaying the marvels of modern technology in the world of art and animation. That I have to give props to. But in terms of everything else, we do need a bit of improvement in order for it to be a desirable series to watch. But otherwise, this movie wasn&#039;t a waste of time and does have a satisfying end.

    *****************************************************************************<br />
This review was for the Blood – C: The Last Dark movie and had nothing to do with the TV series and not even trying to make a comparison between the two pieces, but I’ve recreated it as a sort of an introduction here before I actually dissect the overall film. <br />
******************************************************************************<br />
STORY/PLOT AND CHARACTERS<br />
A continuation from its mother anime TV series Blood - C, an extensive creative collaboration between the all female manga artists group CLAMP and from the studios that run its power down to the core of merging CG(computer graphics) and cel animation in the most flawless way possible, Production IG. Here comes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review94559">
        the conclusive chapter which is presented in this feature film Blood: The Last Dark, following its trail down to the overly hailed as Japan’s first fully digitally animated film Blood: The Last Vampire and as one of IGs flagship titles over the years.  <br />
Following the under explained incidents and horrifying events from the experimental environment that was set on Ukishima Province.  Saya now comes to Tokyo to hunt down her prey under the name of Nanahara Fumito, a person armed with too much political and economic intervention capable of setting laws that take juveniles in following time curfews and making the use of internet somehow censored and being regulated. Behind him, was the secret organization named “TOWER” which engages inhumane experimentation that involves certain undistinguished life forms, known as “The Old Ones”. Under the dystopian Tokyo, resistances were born, taking on the lead is the group called “SIRRUT” whose intention was to throw Fumito out of the picture teaming up with a girl who wears a black sailor uniform with a Japanese sword in her grasp. <br />
As the first eight minutes of the film being stream on the internet one week before the official screening in Japan, I would honestly say that it urges me to fly to the “Nation where the Cherry Blossoms bloom at its Fullest” in no time, better that I haven’t done such thing or I’ll regret it.   Those eight minutes that serve as a prologue somehow, was really good. Having nice angle shots on the opening action scenes, over the top animation quality with some innovative technology on the side which makes us anticipate that something unexpected might happen on the screen on the next few scenes. But just after the movie’s logo is being shown the whole show just drop and continue to descend to the bottom of nowhere. <br />
As the show was regressing the same thing also happens to its plot. Imagine a ball being release from a certain height from the ground; you can observe that the ball bounces up and down but it will never reach or return on its original position/height because of certain rules that regards gravity or any other forces affecting it. Okay, enough physics lessons for today. I just want to put emphasis that as we delve in deeper into its plot, as more characters are being introduce coupled with their past, the more holes are opening up. Not just plot holes but also includes characters’ personality defect or something you may tied up as flaws. Starting from the main protagonist down to the least supporting cast, they seem unnatural and don’t contribute to make a big development to push the story over certain boundaries. These also include some plot twists but those twists are very uninteresting or maybe I should say unnecessary, in a way that evidences of them are explicitly shown that you could simply infer what will happen next. The”Yuri Flavor” in the plotline was also a thing that was not worth including since they eat up some screen time to just add a pointless romance that even Yuri fans wouldn’t bother to buy a copy of it.  You could also see some scenes being parallel on the original “Last Vampire Material” and some crossover universe theme from CLAMP’s previous work (you could see some Watanuki appearances on the trailers) which is an absolute a kind of fan service to boost some numbers of sales.  Maybe the only good word that I could say is “CONSISTENCY”, but I don’t think this consistency (thing) was really good or not. Good because they stick to the original storyline, bad because they were attached on the worst anime prologue ever produced.  <br />
I don’t see any problems if it falls under the supernatural genre (mostly the BLOOD franchise was under sci-fi genre in some ways) if it was executed in a good way possible. But, this has been my problem since in the TV series, why hire CLAMP for such job, since their specialty lies on fantasy and not in supernatural things? Yes, XXXholic may find its way under that genre but I think that wasn’t the best in the field. I’m fine with making them take character design credits but leaving the script to them(though under some supervision from the original creators) is somehow amazingly ridiculous since the famous BLOOD Franchise was one of IG’s biggest contributions on the previous decade and on the industry in which we are in now. But, before the ending credits roll I could speculate that maybe in the near future another reincarnation of this franchise may appear, but I do hope they would hire the genius Gen Urobuchi to weave that plot because I do believe that he have the talent to make a good storyline that starred heroines (Madoka and Saber for example) combined with a dark beautifully twisted flawless plot. <br />
***************************************************************************<br />
ART AND ANIMATION<br />
Visuals were undertaken by Section 5 or simply Studio 5 of Production IG (This section’s works include XXXholic shows and movie, Sky Crawlers, Ghost Hound and PSYCHO – PASS). The extensive use of CG that provides the background was really evident. With IG’s latest innovation on CG that includes overly shining cars with their reflective coating, trains that travels like bullets, soaring chaser helicopters to add with and those beautifully random snowflakes descending (a perfect setting for the winter season of this movie). Towering night skyscrapers as a depiction of the city was in terms of nearing perfection on the aspect of technology.  Flawless animation on intense action scenes as Saya tumbles, jumps, thrown and cut those monsters’ limbs while that crimson thick blood erupts from all over the screen. Overall lighting was commendable despite that this movie tackles about a dark concept, not a single scene was obscure by darkness that you would make you blind for a second instead they are well lit and lighted as properly as they seem.  Obviously, CLAMP made new character (and monster?) designs, aesthetically well but they just ordinarily treated as CLAMP’s trademark and nothing visually new to report. <br />
Despite of those credits on the previous paragraph, flaws still make their way to ascend in order attract my attention. These little(or big) bothering mistakes include almost deformed (or maybe ugly formless) close-up shots that are clearly or evidently made by amateur animators in which you can coupled it with lacking of some kind of quality control on the overall piece. Not drawing a line between the use of 2D and 3D graphics that made those climactic scenes suffer a lot which can also be attributed to the issue stated before. It’s kind of a little sad to say that IG (or maybe the main and only foundation of this movie) had these kind of errors compared to the fact they are the frontrunner in the terms of overwhelming advance technology on animation and having best people on their side.  Still, this movie had art as its main strength and incomparable in terms of its advancement compared those lousy movie animation studios out there.<br />
*****************************************************************************<br />
SOUND AND VOICE ACTING<br />
The pieces of music sound like a techno – tribal theme with some primitive instruments to add with which made those action scenes pulsating and alive.  No problem on the proper application of musical scores and sound effects but they are not that powerful enough to set emotional attachments to certain scenes that are screaming for its necessity. The ending theme song “METRO BAROQUE” which is written and perform by Mizuki Nana have this nice mixture of jazz and blues coupled with Nana’s fantastically tuned interpretation. <br />
On the voicing part, Mizuki Nana (voices Hyuuga Hinata from Naruto series and Alois Trancy from Black Butler 2) really deserves an award for her performance as Saya. Through her over the top voice acting skills she was able to recreate and mold the cold blooded femme fatale while adding those little sounds of pain as those monsters punctured her flesh, up to her extremely loud angry screams as her temper spills. She was able to give me some motivation to watch the entire film just to hear her voice (surprisingly that the main foundation of this movie was somehow diverted to auditory sense rather than the visual presentation that it offers). On the supporting roles Yuki Kaji (does he deserve to be the Best Actor in the 2013 Seiyuu Awards?) and Yuuichi Nakamura (character voice of Tsutugami Gai and Gray Fullbuster in Fairy Tail series) was able play their respective characters quite well. But, the biggest downside on the cast was Ai Kayano (voices Yuzuriha Inori from Guilty Crown and Mayaka Ibara from Hyouka), I know she wants to create diversity on her voice acting roles but her performance here was far more than worst, this is evident because she had the most number of lines on the entire cast.  As she pull her act to scream which made her like a pig being wrestled because she will be slaughtered in her next few breaths, as for her normal speaking voice just “please cover your ears, “is the only advice that I could give, making her character overly dull, bland (or any word you can think that is synonymous to boring) which dragged her fellow voice actors especially Nana’s performance which carries the whole show. <br />
******************************************************************************<br />
OVERALL PRESENTATION<br />
<br />
“NOT BAD.”<br />
This line is fairly generic in any comments, critiques and even reviews. So, I wonder why people always type this clichéd expression while in the back of their minds they are actually saying this, “It’s really bad but I want to sugarcoat things in order not to be hated or banned from this community.”(Now you know, when some random person will make such comment, he is meant to say that your work is bad.) Okay, enough psychology lessons for today, let’s be straightforward and say that this show is “NOT GOOD”. No sugarcoating and not even close to a clichéd. Not a good start and finishes it in a bad end. The main visual foundation was technologically advanced but not quality wise.  Bad main and supporting characters with no good developments, in short A BAD SHOW, watch this if you’re tired of those good shows or you just want some disappointment. Not even recommended to be viewed even if you’re unsatisfied on the ending of the TV series. Maybe it could be recommended to some people who are curios to find out if my review was really true or not. (AHHHH! A lot of redundant words from this paragraph and even from the whole review which are so annoying. So let’s just end it here before I could commit more sins because redundancy, but here are the breakdown of the stats if you’re interested.) <br />
Story: 1<br />
Characters: 1<br />
Art: 7<br />
Animation: 5<br />
Voice: 7<br />
Music: 6<br />
PROS:<br />
+Mizuki Nana’s voice<br />
CONS:<br />
-Everything seems that they have defects except for Nana’s voice acting. <br />
-I fairly accept that even this review should be place here. (I’m not being humble or hypocrite but just being defensive.)<br />

    There are many different anime that center around Blood-C such Blood+ that Blood-C was based off of. But one thing I&#039;ve noticed is that Blood+ has significantly better ratings than Blood-C on MAL, and although I haven&#039;t really watched either of the two, I can guess that Blood-C probably lacked the plot that its predecessor had.<br />
<br />
And here we have Blood-C: The Last Dark, a movie by the renown Production I.G. I think it&#039;s obvious that the leading assets of this movie are its animations. The colors used compliment the mood and the tone in each scene, and the fight scenes are gorgeous with angles, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review88703">
        movement and everything. The glorious graphics sometimes even surpass that of Fate Zero, in some fight scenes.<br />
<br />
But because of all the eye candy, the mediocrity of the voice acting was made apparent. When I was  watching the movie, I felt like the voice acting didn&#039;t appropriately pair up with incredible visuals that I thoroughly enjoyed. A couple of the scenes in the movie felt a bit lacking because of the average voice acting that didn&#039;t portray quite enough emotion to cohere with the intensity depicted in the visuals. I really felt like these visuals deserved more.<br />
<br />
Additionally, I felt that the story was trying to rush itself alone the 1 hour and 47 minutes it had to get itself across while still staying true to the classic defeat-the-final-boss-and-discover-the-bigger-picture sort of plot. A scene or two seemed a bit rushed, and certain scenes that portrayed comic relief from the side characters were over in five seconds, making them feel  a bit awkward and out of place in the serious atmosphere that was created in the beginning. <br />
<br />
This brings me to the point that Blood-C: The Last Dark would have been better off, and more engaging in the beginning  if it were it&#039;s own anime series. Then it would have more time to get its story across instead of squishing it in a two hour time-frame. The development of the characters could also be better executed, in a series, where each episode could go more in depth on the complex characters CLAMP created, instead of squishing everything important, and thought-provoking in the ending moments of the film.<br />
<br />
Overall, I feel like this was a very decent movie, and this would definitely be something to watch if you want to see an impressive execution of graphics. In fact, the graphics that dominated in the end thoroughly won me over to one up the score I had originally given this movie. <br />
<br />
So I give this an 8/10.<br />

    I started watching this after finishing the, frankly, train wreck of a series Blood c that came before it.  So I didn&#039;t really have very high expectations, that being said while the movie itself is a continuation of the series. I actually &#039;liked&#039; the movie more than I did the series.<br />

    Blood C is a good anime. Nevertheless, this movie, sequel of the anime, is not good at all.<br />
<br />
In fact, the story of the movie is good, and well continue the anime (even it isn&#039;t as much worked as the anime&#039;s story). But the fight are really less animated than the anime, the secondary characters are totally secondary, the gore effects are failed compare to the anime.<br />
<br />
However, this movie don&#039;t let you &quot;wanted more&quot;. The studio just hasn&#039;t the money to create a whole second season, that&#039;s why you just feel that the job has been rushed : 12 episodes compressed in one movie.<br />
<br />
The movie could

          <span style="display: none;" id="review237687">
        be good (if it was a whole  season) BUT, it&#039;s a fact and it&#039;s sad, he isn&#039;t.<br />
If you watched the anime, I recommand you to watch the movie, even if he&#039;s bad. You&#039;ll at first not stay on &quot;wanted more&quot;, and at second you&#039;ll have an idea of what the anime would be able to become.

    This review is written towards them who have watched Blood-C and are planning to watch Blood-C: The Last Dark and it’s spoiler free.<br />
<br />
I’m not a fan of the Blood saga and I don’t know much about it, so my review is going to focus in this film and its previous story Blood-C.<br />
<br />
To begin with I was disappointed after I watched the film since I enjoyed the Blood-C anime. This film is a quick and not well done ending to the arc of the Blood saga.<br />
<br />
The location of the series has changed completely, it takes place in a big city with a lot of potential but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212937">
        the film doesn&#039;t take all the benefits that it gives. The first thing you think is that you will see a bloody and gore second part of Blood-C, which as I think is one of the things that made the anime pretty good, but it will disappoint you as soon as it starts. We only are able to see lonely combats without the interaction of innocent people that added the beautiful red colors to the series.<br />
<br />
The character development is cero to none, at least in the anime the little evolution of the characters was justified, but this time we don’t see any of it. Also, we don’t get any plot twist or happy surprises that will make us say “I didn’t expect that!”, at least Blood-C had some painful and horrific deaths that make us think they couldn’t had just happened.<br />
The thing that I didn’t expect at the beginning was the beautiful art and animation, but it couldn’t be true as the film carried out, the end…It turned all the hard work of the animators into a big joke, I literally jump from my bead and got amazed by the awful CGI, it even didn’t have any objective at all.<br />
<br />
From my point of view it should have been better to end the saga with the bloody and “funny” ending of Blood-C. I only give it a 5 because Blood-C needed some kind of ending, having seen that the average score of the film is superior to the one of the anime I expected more of it. I thought that this film deserved to share my thoughts with you since I would recommend this film only because it’s the only finale to Blood-C.<br />
<br />
This is my first review so feel free to criticize my writing and show your opinions, thanks!<br />

    To me, the ending of &quot;Blood-C: The Last Dark&quot; is the crucial piece which ties all the pieces spread out throughout the movie together. That is, the excessive paranoiac love Fumito holds toward Saya is the self-explanatory fact that rationalizes almost all the events happened from the beginning to the end. If I don&#039;t see it in this way, the entire movie otherwise seems meaningless and clueless to me in terms of the storylines and the roles of characters. To Fumito, he expresses his love in an artisanal way to get closer to Saya mentally as well as in physiological structure. That paranoid love is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review168305">
        pretty enchanting though. I will highlight how artistic Fumito this character is, but not the overall animation.<br />
<br />
P.S. I gives 8/10 for &quot;art&quot;, but somehow, the &quot;art&quot; section appears as &quot;animation&quot; on the preview page, so I have to adjust it from 8/10 to 6/10 to fit right of the section.

    Honestly, the movie only received such a high score on my personal list because I enjoyed the animation and have a great deal of respect for Clamp. <br />
<br />
The story left a lot to be desired. I&#039;m all for a few ambiguous pieces of story, but the whole thing is a hot mess of unanswered questions. There is little connection to character, even if you watched the anime events that preceded this movie you find yourself completely disconnected from the protagonist when you should be right there with her wanting revenge. The other characters are borderline throw away despite clearly having backstories of their own. For

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207543">
        those watching just for the action there are a few fight scenes, but they may not be worth the amount of sitting and talking that occurs.<br />
<br />
 Overall, very unsatisfying, and probably wouldn&#039;t recommend to anyone to watch.

    Let me just first say that Saya Kisaragi is BADA$$. Not since Kite has there been a deadly femme fatale donning a school-girl uniform who can shed copious amounts of blood with one swift stroke of her cutlery.<br />
<br />
Let me also add that we get to see Saya naked, which was simultaneously exciting and disturbing. The reason it was disturbing is because she&#039;s wearing a high school uniform, which means she&#039;s underage, right? I felt a little pervy to be honest. Okay, fine. A lot pervy. Lets move on… <br />
<br />
Story: 6. The story is essentially about a girl named Saya seeking revenge on a villain who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203656">
        previously conducted human experiments on her. To be completely honest, I didn&#039;t quite understand the rest. And frankly, I don&#039;t care. The whole movie just felt wayyy too long and drawn out. 90% of the time, I was asking, &quot;Are they going stop talking and fight yet?&quot; <br />
<br />
As for the fight scenes, beginning action was compelling. In fact, it was down right fantastic! I was like, dayum, this is going to be good! Unfortunately, aside from the beginning and the end, there wasn&#039;t much action to write home about. What a let down! <br />
<br />
Art: 9. Perhaps the greatest strength of this movie is its art. It was beautifully done. For something that aired in 2012, it totally rivals/bests some of the anime that is coming out today. In particular, the final showdown/fight had (IMHO) a great blend of CG which was vaguely reminiscent of a moment in the game God of War. Even the car chases were pretty compelling.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6. I enjoyed the first 15 minutes. Was bored for 1 hour. And then enjoyed the last 15 minutes. So my recommendation is to save an hour of your life and just watch the beginning and ending, and you&#039;ll have a good grasp of Blood-C: The Last Dark.<br />

So..this ended really wtf. It made no sense. I was thinking maybe it&#039;s just because I haven&#039;t watched blood-c in about a year? I still remember for the most part what happened in the series, but I&#039;m totally lost. All that only for Fumito to basically just kill himself? I can see they were kind of going for a deeper meaning complex type of ending, but I just didn&#039;t really find the ending all that meaningful. <br />
<br />
Now what&#039;s funny here is I first watched BTLV without knowing it was related to blood+ or blood-c. I didn&#039;t find this out until watching blood-c so I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review235795">
        pretty much went backwards. Now my new question at this point is what happens after BTLV? I may as well watch blood+ now.

    Pretty basic anime movie sequel to the series Blood-C that came out, and wraps things up in a tidy bow. But of course, we still have questions of whether or not Saya is going to have to keep fighting Elder Bairns... Hopefully we will see more.<br />
<br />
The story takes place 6 months after the anime series ends, which doesn&#039;t really seem like a lot of time. Saya has changed, and is more of a hardened character since her departure in Blood-C. In terms of gore, this anime movie didn&#039;t make me cringe, so either 1) I have grown immune to it, since I kind of forced

          <span style="display: none;" id="review188010">
        myself to when I watch animes, OR 2) It was toned down unlike the series. Either way, I didn&#039;t think it was that bad. Honestly was expecting cringe inducing gore, but I felt it was tame. <br />
<br />
I really enjoyed this film, seeing as we get to see more of Saya, and I like this new version of her. She has changed a lot since Blood+, and CLAMP and I.G. have created a new Saya that seems to surpass the others. She gives me exactly what I want in a female lead, while not going too overboard. She doesn&#039;t pull any deus ex machines, not from what I thought. You gotta think, Saya fights to survive. So nothing she does is nearly unethical or unbelievable. Even during the most climactic moments in the movie, she still retains the ability to be &quot;slow&quot; at reacting, which makes her not a deus ex character.<br />
<br />
Visuals are stunning, but in this day and age, anime usually is. However, the visuals are pleasing and I enjoyed the character&#039;s art. Saya looks older, mature, and very different from the Saya we thought we knew.<br />
<br />
Elder Bairn action is a minimum, but the fights are awesome. We do get to see some bloodshed, very little at that. Or maybe I am just immune. Either way, it was pretty nice to see some fights that seemed epic. <br />
<br />
I would recommend this anime to anyone who likes Blood, or has seen the series before. Make sure you watch the anime series FIRST, seeing as you lose a lot of the plot connection and anger towards the main villain. I for one enjoyed seeing it happen.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack wasn&#039;t fairly memorable, so I set the score lower.<br />
<br />
Also, if you are cringy, this anime is tame. So don&#039;t feel like you have to hold your sides or feel squeamish. Anime is WAY worse in terms of blood, but for an entry to gory animes, you could say this is about as worse as it gets for nightmare fuel. At least, from what I&#039;ve seen.

    I thought this movie would be necessary to bring closure to the Blood-C series. In the end though it really wasn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Saya goes through all these hoops only to basically be told the same thing at the end of the anime.<br />
<br />
It was frustrating and slow, but it looked a lot cleaner than the already clean series in terms of animation. <br />
<br />
Basically this movie will just reinforce the ending of Blood-C and say that nothing good will ever happen to this character ever, and it won&#039;t even answer any of the questions it raised through the series and the beginning of the movie.

    I have the individual rating comparisons down the bottom if you want to skip the review.<br />
<br />
The review is going to be a non-spoiler comparison between the original Blood-C and this movie. If you hated the original, I will attempt to convince you to watch this. If you liked the original you&#039;ll probably like this too... Maybe. <br />
<br />
The original Blood-C was one of the worst animes I&#039;ve had the experience of watching. Unoriginal generic characters who gain no development or complexity throughout, generic &quot;monsters&quot; with no backstory or development, terrible pacing, really bad animation and lazy music which is the OPPOSITE of how this movie operates.<br />
<br />
However,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262262">
        my main complaint of the original Blood-C isn&#039;t any of those things listed above, it was that it lacked any sort of direction. There was always a small plot lurking in the backrounds of Saya being manipulated by those around her. This eventually leads to a plot twist close to the end. Unfortunately the entire story was just stalled without anything happening until that plot twist arrived. All the characters being completely one-dimensional made this stall incredibly boring and pointless. &quot;Do we keep her as a cute, innocent school girl blindly murdering these creatures or do we actually progress the plot?&quot; Unfortunately, stalling the plot was the answer they came up with.<br />
<br />
This movie contained more character development in the first 3 minutes than the original series did in it&#039;s entire 12 episodes. The dark, gorey, eerie setting was nailed down instantly, the mood was set, the tone was set and the characters (especially Saya) actually came across as a like-able, REAL people who you can actually relate to. It&#039;s like there was a board meeting where the production team actually talked about the direction they wanted the movie to go in. &quot;Do we want a fast paced action romp? a high school rom-com with monsters? A dark, gorey slow-paced psychological thriller?&quot; Instead of the mash up of ideas that the first contained.<br />
<br />
Even Saya who came across as the most unlikeable, generic character possible in the original now seems like a complete bad ass with a complex morality based on the shit she had to go through. All the characters in this movie have unique, likeable personalities that develop as things happen. It&#039;s crazy how much difference having good characters made. The movie has high production values, sure, but having good characters doesn&#039;t require money, just a writer who cares. <br />
<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION:<br />
<br />
In the end, the film turned out to be a slow-paced, dark, intense psychological about a cold, complex girl, messed up by her dark past looking for revenge but finding something more important. There is a lot of dialogue, it&#039;s a very quiet and sombre but also an intense and dark film (with still some fast, lively action scenes). If you can embrace the movie for what it is you will love it.<br />

    I only watched it out of spite of haven watched the actual show a while ago and was horribly disappointed with this movie. I must have paused it at least 4 times to go and do something else and pressed play hoping something out of the blue would happen, but, unfortunately it didn&#039;t. Really predictable outcome and very difficult to watch because nothing exceptional happened. Some of the characters have specific personalities that suit them well and are well executed in sound and feel, others, such as the main character, remain more or less mysterious, unless you have watched the series. <br />
