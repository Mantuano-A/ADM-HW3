    I&#039;ll say this right away, Children of the Whales is not for everyone. <br />
<br />
It has amazing music and eye-catching visuals, but the story requires the audience to be interested in its themes of emotion and utopianism. The characters and setting have incredibly satisfying arcs throughout the show, but if you&#039;re not invested in them you won&#039;t find the arcs engaging or nearly as cathartic as I did. If it sinks its hooks in you by the first episode, then chances are you&#039;ll enjoy this show.<br />
<br />
The world of Children of the Whales asks its characters to conceal their emotions for the greater good; a clever premise.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266276">
        The show uses a bit of reverse psychology to immediately establish emotions as the crux of the narrative. Emotions are the core of this story but powered by a melancholic soundtrack, self-confident directing, and some of the best world-building this season, Children of the Whales becomes incredibly immersive. Falling short of the manga by a small amount for cutting out some character backstories, minor side information that adds a bit more detail to the setting, and occasionally awkwardly adapted scenes.<br />
<br />
[Story: 7/10]<br />
A vast ocean of sand carries the Mud Whale, a giant magic powered clay ship that is home to many people trying to live out their lives peacefully despite being limited to a small closed off society. Living in a small town myself I connected with the setting immediately. The feeling of being trapped in a contained society that I don’t quite fit in with is shared by a group of characters in this show. <br />
About 90% of the population possess telekinetic abilities known as saimia, which leads the afflicted to an early death which earns them the title of “the marked”. This leaves the 10% of normal people to assume the role of the government, who are also referred to as “unmarked”. The show opens with a somber funeral scene where the main character Chakuro is seen holding back tears with many other fellow Mud Whalers. Everyone on the Mud Whale is taught to suppress their sadness whenever they are reminded by the early deaths they will inevitably face, instead of accepting the fact that they will die soon, they choose to live blissfully ignorant by forgetting about their deceased friends and moving on quickly. <br />
<br />
Anyone who has experienced the death of a friend or family member can surely agree that holding in your feelings only makes it worse. Getting sad and acknowledging the loved ones you’ve lost is how you’re able to grow and move on and that pain you feel proves that you loved and were loved. That&#039;s the sentiment Chakuro begins to lean towards after realizing the Mud Whale&#039;s rules are biased. Right away an uncertainty towards the unmarked ones is planted in the audience&#039;s minds when the rules of the Mud Whale are established. The show is able to get into your mind in subtle ways to make you ponder certain subjects so that when they&#039;re brought up more as arcs progress you will feel more emotionally impacted. However, if you don&#039;t follow these arcs intently then you&#039;ll be missing out on a large portion of the experience. Otherwise, the worthwhile pay offs may seem like a desperate attempt to make you sad. This is probably what led so many people to hate the show. <br />
<br />
The conflict of the story comes from the Mud Whale’s interaction with another island and how radically different their beliefs are. The Mud Whaler’s beliefs towards life and emotion are put to the test as they violently clash with their enemies, creating some of the most memorable scenes in the show that stuck with me long after watching. Complex themes woven into the story are not delivered through tiresome exposition. The show gives the audience the pieces of the puzzle without holding the audience&#039;s hand and it expects you to figure it out, which makes the experience incredibly rewarding and refreshing. If the idea of working out that puzzle sounds unappealing to you then perhaps Children of the Whales may not be for you, however, I’d still recommend watching the first episode just to see if it sinks its hooks in you like it did to me.<br />
<br />
One of the show’s most intriguing hooks is how central emotions are to the story. The telekinetic powers are controlled by emotion, the Mud Whalers are taught to suppress their emotions. The mystery is so compelling. Just by merely rewatching the first two episodes I picked up on many clues sprinkled into the dialogue (by the talented author) for the sake of people who choose to rewatch. It’s a show that wants you to love it and unravel its mysteries, and it surely isn’t hard to love it once you notice the clues placed with such elegance and care. <br />
<br />
Everything in the show has an arc, the characters, the themes, and especially the constantly evolving setting. I loved the way the show reveals information about the world periodically and usually in subtle ways. Whether it be a brief line said quietly by the outsider Lykos or the interesting but vicious psychopaths who invade the Mud Whale. Through meeting new people the islanders broaden their horizons and even the physical island undergoes an evolution. And the way that the Mud Whale actually changes is so satisfying to watch. We see the Mud Whalers live in blissful ignorance in their &quot;utopian&quot; society, then eventually the image is cathartically shattered and their whole world is altered irreparably. <br />
<br />
I never felt like the show wasted my time. From the first minutes of episode one, it grabbed me with the emotion hook and a society cut-off from the world. Then onward I was getting info on the world that I was already very interested in! If you&#039;re not grabbed by the show from the first episode you probably never will be. It&#039;s a sad truth that makes the show more niche than it needed to be. I&#039;m hoping enough fans find it to warrant a sequel because the story isn&#039;t over yet. <br />
<br />
The one small gripe I had with the story was how the pace is a bit on the quick side. I liked how it never felt like the show was dragging on, but honestly, I wouldn’t have had a problem with more slow scenes to get more of the little details about the Mud Whale I felt were missing from the show. The dialogue is typically quite simplistic, which may bother some viewers. I rarely found annoying given that it allows for the many interesting themes to be visible and easily analyzable. <br />
<br />
[Character: 7/10]<br />
The characters have visible arcs that meld them into the sort of believable people you can root for.<br />
The mud-whalers start out as bumbling idiots, unable to comprehend the danger they are in. After they experience a devastating tragedy (which I won&#039;t reveal) the entire ship undergoes a change. They train and prepare themselves, it was cathartic to see them go from fools who thought they were in control, to wise and determined fighters who understood the struggle they had to endure in order to survive. Watching the three lead characters, Chakuro, Ouni, and Lykos develop is where most of the show’s engagement is derived from. All of them have interesting backstories that are explored in the show. As if they were magnets, the more they experience the more through learning from each other and the tragic events they experience, their characters progress in visible ways. The friends of the main three characters also have individual arcs. This sense of character progression really made the main cast endearing to watch, I was rooting for them all by the end despite a few duds in the roster.<br />
<br />
I’ve seen the protagonist Chakuro get criticized for being kind of a wimp. To that I say, he’s meant to be like that. This isn’t some shounen power fantasy. It’s shoujo. The male characters show plenty of emotion and cry just as much as the female ones. Some people might hate this but I found it refreshing to see this level of sensitivity, it really helped make the show’s theme of emotions believable. I did have an issue with the characters that prevented me from giving them a full score. It’s made clear at the start of the show that there are so many people living in Mud Whale, but as the show goes on it pulls from this unknown amount of random people to use as accessories to the main characters. Instead of killing main cast members these randos are killed nearby the leads, which does add a little bit to the tension. I felt like whenever these characters were added into the lead cast pool I knew they’d be the first to die, just an unnecessary layer of predictability.<br />
<br />
The fantastic world building is extended to the characters due to how well rooted in the world they all are. Citizens of the Mud Whale feel like they belong there. For example; we see that the Mud Whalers don’t get much punishment because there’s almost no crime, which explains why they’re all so carefree and lack a whole lot of respect for the rules and the elders that wrote them. Some of the citizens hate the Mud Whale for how small and closed off it is. Just simply knowing this detail about them makes them all the more believable. I feel similar to the characters who despised their birthplace so even though they don’t get a whole lot of development I was able to connect with them and place myself in their shoes. <br />
<br />
As for the villains, the majority of them are the murderous invaders of the Mud Whale. What the invaders lack in charisma they more than make up for in introspection. Their quiet, logic-based demeanor clash with the emotion-fueled personas of the Mud Whalers. Their motivations make sense from a utilitarian perspective, but put yourself in their shoes long enough and you’ll hate yourself for understanding their beliefs. The antagonist is a vile &#039;idea&#039; rather than a sole character, orchestrated by a few key players. Ryodari is one of the standout villains, with his visually distinct pink; he has emotions but due to the society he lives in he has become something of an outcast. His arc becomes visible during the middle half of the show and after that, he becomes a reoccurring character to give the audience an insightful look at life outside of the Mud Whale. <br />
<br />
[Art: 8/10]<br />
Despite taking place in a world made of mostly sand and mud, the show is visually breathtaking. The characters look good enough if a bit similar, varying hair colors liven the mostly sand color palette. The hair coupled with vibrantly blue sky gives the world a lot of vibrancy due to the contrast. It occasionally feels like the characters are individual objects to the environments, as they have different visual styles. When a gust of wind sweeps glittering sand across the screen or the mud whalers use saimia they look like they belong in that world, but sadly there are a few moments that didn’t sit right with me. But even during the low points, the show is still stunning and it held my attention constantly. <br />
<br />
Having read the first volume of the manga I can say that the show feels like the manga put in motion as accurately as possible, but sometimes this problematic for the director. Some static scenes in the manga would be transferred into static scenes in the show with a bit of animation of the characters but the background details would be totally unmoving. Making it feel like you’re watching a picture book. Most of these issues are in the earlier episodes when the show is a bit less dynamic, either way, it’s always visually appealing even it takes a little while for the director to find the right way to frame the show.<br />
<br />
[Sound: 9/10]<br />
An uplifting folky ballad opens each episode with some really thought-provoking lyrics that allude to the evolution the Mud Whale undertakes. I love the orchestral soundtrack to Children of the Whales. It always seems to reflect not only the emotion of a scene but the atmosphere and location of the scene. Great insert songs during titular moments to really hammer home the importance of those scenes. They do a good job of defining a turning point in the story but their mellowness is gentle on the ears.<br />
Strong voice acting, but I’ll be on the lookout for Netflix’s English dub in the near future as they tend to be well cast.<br />
<br />
[Enjoyment: 8.5/10]<br />
Mystifying and almost religious atmosphere to the show. The way that the director hangs on certain shots to highlight their importance, cutting out all sound, and giving you time to understand the what makes that shot so titular. <br />
<br />
In the earlier episodes, I was incredibly frustrated at how the Mud Whalers become paralyzed whenever confronted with danger. I understand that in their utopian society they never faced war, but it was painful to watch. It wasn’t helped by the fact that those scenes were dragged on a lot more than they were in the manga. Thankfully this issue is addressed later on in a satisfying way that I’d rather not reveal for the sake of keeping this review spoiler-free. A few annoying pacing issues during the first half of the show that didn’t affect the overall story but hindered some scenes moment-to-moment enjoyment. This is most likely due to the director struggling to find the right length of time to hang on a specific shot. In the second half of the show, I noticed significantly fewer issues and plenty of impressively delivered moments. Sometimes the director hangs on specific shots of characters to convey a sense of weight during turning points of the story.  <br />
<br />
Overall I was impressed more than bothered. Some people might not care about those minor issues but those that do will probably have no trouble getting past them once they see the show’s other merits. <br />
<br />
Score Breakdown:<br />
[Story: 7] Great world building, high rewatch value, rewarding twists.<br />
[Art: 8] Pretty visuals but characters look too independent of the backgrounds.<br />
[Sound: 9] Great music and op/ed, nice insert songs, solid voice work.<br />
[Character: 7] Constantly evolving main characters, large supporting cast.<br />
[Enjoyment: 8.5] Frustrating at times, but gripping in the end.<br />
<br />
[Overall: 8/10]<br />
The audiovisual splendor of Children of the Whales grabbed my attention immediately, but as it continued on I saw there was more to it than met the eyes. I&#039;ll admit that it&#039;s niche as hell and as such many people won&#039;t get into it. If the first episode sinks its hooks in you, then chances are you&#039;ll find the journey the characters and world undergo to be an incredibly rewarding one.

    To all appearances Children of the Whales seemed to be a promising anime. I have the impression that the series held all the necessary elements to be a memorable work: partially interesting and potentially exceptional worldbuilding, splendid artistic direction, intriguing characters... but after 2 episodes, the series goes in another direction and gets worse gradually. In the end, we have a lot of tears, melodrama, inconsistencies, and far too much in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Story: Chakuro is 14 years old and is an archivist / scribe on the Mud Whale, an island that floats on a sea of endless sand. That island has several specificities. There are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266284">
        two types of people: marked and unmarked. Chakuro is in the first category, that is, he can use saimia, a supernatural ability that unfortunately is responsible for their untimely death. There are other rules like never fighting (very useful to be used as a plot-convenience), not to cry for dead people and especially not to inquire about their existence and their presence on the island. Indeed the Council that governs the people of Mud Whale, doesn&#039;t want its people to understand why they live here and why they have supernatural powers.<br />
<br />
And Chakuro? One day he makes a trip with some friends (including Ohni) to an island they discover nearby (without the authorization of the Council). They meet a mysterious girl named Lykos. They also find a strange structure called the Noûs (which absorbs the emotions of humans)<br />
Chakuro brings Lykos on the Mud Whale. The Council strongly opposes and decides to question the girl. However I specify that the girl is a kuudere (yeah ! useful for plot-convenience) so she isn&#039;t really willing to talk. We also learn that she can&#039;t express her emotions.<br />
<br />
As I said before, the premise seemed interesting. Many mysteries concerning the origin of the inhabitants of the Mud Whale, on Lykos (which seems to come from another country), and in a general way on the world, where are the other peoples and why the Mud Whale seems so isolated? Episode 3 will therefore answer some questions but I admit that this episode was particularly disastrous. Disastrous for the Mud Whale and for the credibility of the series.<br />
<br />
(Light spoilers from there because there is almost impossible to talk about that show without mentioning some scenes)<br />
<br />
This episode 3 begins with the arrival of a gigantic ship called Skylos. The leader (called Oruko) of this ship decides to annihilate all the inhabitants of Mud Whale. Why? No explanation at first, we understand later that the inhabitants of Mud Whale were exiled a hundred years ago. Why exiled? Because they have emotions. And it is here that the series seems hardly credible. If the other inhabitants don&#039;t have emotions then why do we see the other pink-haired idiot (Ryodari) be glad killing innocent people? Why is Oruka so happy to kill people? We always see him laughing. So they get emotional !<br />
Well, I won&#039;t be a scold. There is an explanation for Ryodari who apparently has strong emotions. Honestly I have the impression that this explanation was later created to erase the inconsistencies and that it was not really anticipated. Also, the introduction of this character was particularly bad and this character is really detestable. I don&#039;t care about his situation and I don&#039;t sympathize.<br />
However, I didn&#039;t have explanations for the other characters. The Noûs is supposed to absorb their emotions so why do we see Oruko laughing? Why do we see the other captain being scared when he meets the Daimonias for the first time? They aren&#039;t supposed to have emotions so they should just be indifferent.<br />
<br />
I can understand that it is difficult to create characters without emotions but in this case, why the author decided to make a difference between the inhabitants of the Mud Whale and the other populations? Finally they are rather similar. When they are in danger, they are afraid. When they are happy, they smile. What is the difference between Oruko and the inhabitants of Mud Whale?<br />
By the way, a surprising point. When the inhabitants of the island are threatened by the Skylos army, they decide not to defend themselves. The army wants to kill them but they do not react. Why? Because they don&#039;t have the right to kill, yeah !<br />
Ah ! So the inhabitants of Mud Whale prefer to respect this stupid law than to defend themselves in order to save their friends and their families. Ironically I have the impression that it is rather the inhabitants of the island who lack feelings, compassion.<br />
<br />
From this episode 3, the series was getting progressively worse. The Skylos decided to leave the inhabitants alive (after killing a lot of people, I confirm) and to abandon Lykos on the island. Lykos was a member of their army, so it made sense that the Skylos wanted Lykos to get back on the boat. However Oruko prefers to leave her on the island to do an experiment. This intention probably has no meaning and doesn&#039;t lead to any rational explanation, believe me. Oruko promises to return in a few days to completely annihilate them. (You can write &quot;lol&quot; here) The inhabitants decide to avenge their companions despite the opposition of the Council. The Council is really irritating and looks stupid. Honestly, I don&#039;t know why they are so keen to hide all the truths about their origin. This obstinacy doesn&#039;t really make sense. Furthermore, you will see that some of the members of the Council will even try to sink the boat so that its inhabitants don&#039;t fight. Again, why?<br />
<br />
Why don&#039;t the inhabitants of the island have permission to fight? Will they receive a curse? Many elements are unfortunately not explained. Especially that these same inhabitants fight later and aren&#039;t really subject to a curse. The only thing that could make you doubt is the Daimonias. This is the only potential danger but still, the anime didn&#039;t show us that this power was dangerous for the allies.<br />
<br />
Also, the inhabitants don&#039;t have the right to cry for their dead. Why? No credible explanation. They all cry at the end of episode 3 and even constantly, each character has a tear in their eyes and there is no consequence. I don&#039;t see any curse or misfortune because the characters cried. They are unhappy because the Skylos invade their territory and kill their friends, their families.<br />
Ah!<br />
The curse of the whale? I don&#039;t see anything except a war, so it&#039;s not about the whale.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s go through the inconsistencies to talk about the drama. The drama isn&#039;t credible. We constantly have scenes that alternate nonsense comedy and drama. And because of this I have difficulties to sympathize with the characters. For example, you see characters like Ginshu making jokes in really inappropriate moments. You see the other character touching the characters&#039; hair as they prepare to fight the Skylos army. There are always some foolish scenes that contrast too much with the dramatic atmosphere.<br />
<br />
Regarding the characters, they are numerous. The main cast would be Chakuro, Lykos and Ohni. But the secondary cast is very present. You have a short flashback and you quickly know their feelings. However, as you know that these flashbacks indicate their future death (otherwise they wouldn&#039;t show it), suddenly the result seems predictable and uninteresting. And since their screentime is too short, it is difficult to worry about their fate. In a word, it&#039;s sloppy.<br />
<br />
Chakuro is a very effective character for melodrama as he cries a lot and easily shows his emotions. He is very passionate at times! I don&#039;t really know what to feel for this character. He never managed to interest me in fact. He is slow, indecisive, timid, really, and his personality doesn&#039;t evolve. He seems to like Lykos but their relationship isn&#039;t particularly worked insofar as the plot takes up too much space.<br />
<br />
Lykos is your cute kuudere. She doesn&#039;t talk with others but the character is well written. At first, she has no emotions (it makes sense !) and living with the inhabitants of Mud Whale, she will gradually feel emotions. It&#039;s a shame that the series isn&#039;t more focused on this character. It would have been interesting if we had more access to Lykos&#039; thoughts. However, she is rather irritating thereafter. She knows some things but like the Council, she doesn&#039;t want to reveal anything and it&#039;s annoying. (Example: why do the marked ones die when they are young? Chakuro and the others don&#039;t know it, so why didn&#039;t she inform them?)<br />
<br />
Ohni is probably the best character in the series. He is tired of living on the Mud Whale and wants to discover other places, other countries. And he even fought the first time against the Skylos army while the others didn&#039;t dare. So he must have been one of the few characters to use his brain.<br />
On the other hand, some of the secondary characters were so stupid that I laughed sometimes. For example, Suou, this character is hilarious. He is obviously not credible as a leader since he cries all the time and is unable to make decisions courageously. Besides, I remember a scene where he tries to save Ryodari. I specify that Ryodari is responsible for the death of many inhabitants (and that he doesn&#039;t regret), so WHY SUOU WANTS RYODARI TO LIVE ON THE MUD WHALE?<br />
<br />
(To mention a scene that made me cringe: Suou appears naked to meet people from another country. That leader... )<br />
<br />
On technical aspects, the series is very satisfying. The artistic direction is truly sublime and original. I personally loved the staging, it was really beautiful. The chara design is not my cup of tea. Male characters often look like trap but the female characters and especially Lykos are very charming. The soundtrack is not really remarkable, there are surprisingly a lot of songs. I didn&#039;t find them incredible but pleasant enough. (Neri is really a mysterious character) The opening theme is definitely one of my favorites of the year. Regarding the seiyuus, I didn&#039;t particularly like the narrative parts. The narration doesn&#039;t bother me even though it&#039;s excessive (like Durarara) but Natsuki Hanae has a monotonous and boring voice. <br />
<br />
Disappointing. This is the first word that comes to mind. The end is also unsatisfying since the conclusion doesn&#039;t answer all the questions. I can&#039;t recommend this series but if you want to discover interesting worlds with a coherent worldbuilding and some interesting characters, watch Shinsekai yori or even stuff like the Attack on Titan do the trick.

    So far, this is a big disappointment.<br />
<br />
After having watched two great somewhat similar shows this year, I was looking forward to this one, specially after having seen how the show looks, which I believe is the main reason most people are giving this one a try.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the production is the only good thing about this show, and on some cases even that is a issue, specially on some action scenes, when the character&#039;s don&#039;t even look like they inhabit the world of the background(or just stand there doing nothing for no reason at all).<br />
<br />
The main issue I have with this show are the characters. Most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263856">
        (if not all) of them are very generic tropes with generic designs, some of them do have interesting traits, but they&#039;re left pretty undeveloped, and most of those characters exist for pretty much no reason. Seriously, there&#039;s an absurd amount of character&#039;s being introduced at a nonstop pace, and we don&#039;t  know (or remember) most of their names, which makes it even harder for the somewhat interesting characters to have any development, most of those characters will probably be killed at some point (they already started being killed actually), and that&#039;s also a problem, since we know nothing about they and have no reason to care about the main characters because of how superficial they are.<br />
<br />
There are even some small details that apparently are plot holes, since I doubt they&#039;ll ever be explained, but I don&#039;t want to give spoilers.<br />
<br />
This show has a lot of obvious issues, and I don&#039;t think I can recommend it to anyone, unless you want to look at some gorgeous artwork, but you&#039;ll probably end up being betrayed by it.<br />

    If you asked anyone to describe Children of the Whales, they would probably call it a tragedy. The people that enjoyed it would say it’s a heartbreaking tragedy filled with death and agony, a show packed with emotion. The people that disliked it would call it a tragedy in a more literal sense, and personally I agree with them. With boring and unexplored characters, predictable and badly paced drama, and a dollop of plot armour to top it all off, Children of the Whales manages to mess up almost every part of what could have made it an interesting watch.<br />
<br />
Our MC for the show Chakuro

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266405">
        feels like a misplaced side character given a slight power boost. He doesn’t do much but survive the whole ordeal and worry about everything, making him completely irrelevant to the story. Our converted enemy Lykos is only around for plot progression, occasionally rising up to be important and then shrinking back into a somewhat empty cast member. The real MC Ouni is the one that holds the most importance and gets explored more than every other character, but for some reason, the show continues to brush him aside so our two less interesting mascots Chakuro and Lykos can take over.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast are only around to create drama, make stupid decisions, and die when needed. I can’t count the amount of faceless blobs of mass that have lost their lives in a desperate attempt to suck out some fragment of despair from its audience. It tries to make us feel attached to people while making no attempt to actually allow us to get to know any of them. There are a few people that the show deems to be of some worth for whatever reason, so it keeps them alive with the wonderful power of plot armour and convenience. Instead of enemies killing them instantly like they do with every other unlucky soul, they take their time to have a little conversation to reveal some plot points, allowing our good guys to make it out alive so they can again be unimportant.<br />
<br />
Talking about dying, the drama is a collection of the most predictable situations I have ever seen. You can see almost everything coming from a mile away, and when the show does try to surprise you, the horrid pacing stops you from giving a single shit about each lacklustre episode. Add in the already mentioned plot armour and character stupidity and you are left with massacre after massacre that carry no meaning other than to be a cheap emotional scene for us to sigh over. The only parts that carry any impact are centred around Ouni dealing with his history as a mole rat and him trying to protect his friends. However, the pacing and plot armour still brought it down quite significantly. The story could have made a comeback if it had just played its cards right. To make it even worse, the story ends right when everything is building up for a major arc, just to throw the cherry on the mess that was supposed to be a cake.<br />
<br />
Now the two biggest problems I have with this anime are the plot holes and singing. The show states that the Allied Empire, the antagonists of the show, is a country filled with emotionless citizens for reasons explained in the show. Emotionless characters are a tough thing to write so many opt to go with characters that start off emotionless and slowly learn to have human feelings, with even Children of the Whales trying (and failing) this with Lykos. However, the supposedly blank slates that our good guys fight against sure seem to be pretty human to me. Showing signs of fear, desires, and ambition, it’s really frustrating having the show keep telling you that they are emotionless when they are clearly not.<br />
<br />
And the bloody singing. Why does the show think it’s alright to break out into songs during the middle of a battlefield? Are they trying to make the show seem more deep and dark with a random sad musical playing over some the serious scenes of the anime? I’m trying to find a reason to like this show but it decides to make up for its terrible drama by distracting us with a little singalong. What the legit fuck? It annoys me so much to see something so out of place in an already bad anime.<br />
<br />
Children of the Whales is a show that deserves little praise. It is a massive disappoint that it’s only redeeming point is that it looks nice. No one cares about how good a show looks if the story going alongside it is subpar. Avoid this show, move past it and find something that’s actually worth putting your time into, because this show is just a waste of time.

    Watching shoujo fantasy adventures these days feels like taking a dive into a video game world. When Kujira no Kora Wa Sujou ni Utau (Children of the Whales) began airing, I had a strange instinct about the show. It felt like an anime that really wanted us to really embrace its ideas but fell short on capitalizing on all of them.<br />
<br />
Created by Abi Umeda, few people probably heard of the author’s name. Taking a close look at their resume, some of their work consists of horror genre series. Crafting a shoujo fantasy adventure sounded like a challenge. However, I will say this: the author decided

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266242">
        to mold a variety of themes together that felt different from some of the other shoujo fantasy series I’ve seen in the past. To be clear, I think this show is suited for an audience beyond just the female demographic.<br />
<br />
Are you the target audience? Let’s test that theory. Do you enjoy watching a show with colorful world fiction? How about a show with a large cast of characters? Or conflicts involving a utopia certainly thrown into turmoil? If any of these are on your bucket list, then definitely give it a try. That being said, the main attraction on paper is so far the setting. Mud Whale is really a unique dynamic that will draw attention. In an endless sea of sand of the Sand Era, Mud Whale is a moving vessel composed of an unique civilization. There are the “marked ones” who are individuals with psychokinetic powers but have a short life span. On the other hand, there are the “unmarked ones”, individuals who possesses no powers but have longer life spans. It’s interesting to note that these people live in isolation so they know nothing about the outside world. The plot involves a mysterious girl named Lykos as she changes the lives of everyone on Mud Whale.<br />
<br />
As a 1-cour adaptation running for 12 episodes, I was a bit worried. Before even watching, I had to be less optimistic because it meant the likely event that the show will omit content and also leave questions for the viewers. Unfortunately, that came to be the case after this series ended. It felt like an advertisement of the manga and wants the audience’s hunger for more. As a manga reader, I am thankful that the anime adapted the story consistently with what the overall tone of the setting. But for the overall story, it really felt lacking. My early impression of the show kept me wanting for more though. The first few episodes established the setting and really gives a feel of a shoujo fantasy adventure. We have the characters living their lives in harmony as part of a utopia. Despite being isolated, they behave like humans and have their own system like the council, battle platoons, and recreational services. That changes after Lykos makes her appearance with Mud Whale while bringing attention from outsiders. It transformed the show from a harmonious story into one with dramatic conflicts. This elevates into bloodshed, pain, and even death. <br />
<br />
Now as I watched more of this series, I accepted that only the main core characters will get their spotlight. The ones you see on the key visuals includes Chakuro, Lykos, Ouni, Suou, Ginshu, Ryodari, and Sami. Chakuro is the main guy who bears a gentle personality. This is a contrast to characters such as the emotionless Lykos and cold hearted Ouni. While I can’t say Chakuro is an impressive protagonist on paper, he is able to influence others such as Lykos throughout the show. The two forges a unique bond after the two begins to understand each other more. However, the anime doesn’t go too far into developing their relationship nor does it explore them individually as characters. It’s sad to realize this but I think omitting characterization makes the characters harder to accept. For the others, they play a variety of roles such as Suou becoming a leader, Ouni as the rigid combatant, or Ginshu as a guard of Mud Whale. It’s also noticeable that even deceased characters in the series has some influence on the present story. This is especially true when applied to characters like Chakuro as death affects his mentality. Meanwhile, I can’t say the antagonists of the series are appealing. The most noticeable one to point fingers at is Ryodari, the pink haired child soldier. We only see a glimpse of his past but it’s shown that he is clearly unstable and has a thirst to kill for the thrill of it. It lacks any depth in characterization and really doesn’t make him feel believable as a character. Indeed, the characters in the show is a mixed bag. As I watched more and more of this series, it felt like the creator didn’t really put too much thought into making them.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the experience I got from watching this anime felt rather memorable at times. The drama brings a reality to death and there’s a sense of tragedy that can send chills down the spine. While character chemistry isn’t always meaningful, it does have a way to express itself and evoke emotions. The vulnerability of the characters is clear and it shouldn’t take long for viewers to discover how death affects them. While it is also a shoujo, don’t expect romance to actually develop though. It serves more as a genre to carry the style of the story. The mystery elements develops more and more as the story progresses but don’t expect answers to everything. It’s explored through some background storytelling but will still leave viewers to their imaginations.<br />
<br />
Adapted by J.C. Staff, this anime really stood out in the artwork department. A utopia like Mud Whale is depicted as a perfect society and before the events of Lyko’s encounter, it really does look like one. From the simple character outfits to natural spectacles, it’s a sight to feast eyes on. Mud Whale itself is also decorated with colorful features such as the sand particles, atypical structure, and natural aesthetics. The world fiction gives the impression of what a fantasy shoujo should be with the endless sand. It feels like a vast open world video game. Character designs also makes quite an impression as a majority of the cast are children. It gives off a sense of innocence, vulnerability, and youth. There’s also violence so do expect action to pick up once the conflicts really gets going. The amount of blood isn’t presented as shock value but more as a way to illustrate the reality of death. Fan service isn’t explicit but does also exist with bath scenes so be on the lookout for that.<br />
<br />
Beautiful and harmonious. That’s how I’d describe the theme songs of the show and overall tone of the OST. The technical elements of the soundtrack is outstanding to fit with the genres of this anime. Sound director Jin Aketagawa (known for his work on some other fantasy series) impressed me with the overall direction. The synchronization of the soundtrack with some of the more emotional scenes made them feel impactful. Not to mention, there’s also harmonious singing in the show that really took my attention. Character voice mannerism can be a mixed bag at times. Lykos is too emotionless to be memorable while most of the younger characters all sound the same. Ryodari takes his personality often too far to be declared impressive.<br />
<br />
Adapting a shoujo fantasy adventure isn’t easy but the final product that came to be felt like it’s missing something. Whether it’s the weak characterization or underdeveloped plot is up for you to decide. It definitely has visual splendor though and sells its setting convincingly to viewers. I just wish they took more time to expand the story and characters to really capitalize on this series as a whole. To me, this is a show that needed more passion to bring audience for appreciation.<br />

    The best fantastic adventures take you to cool worlds full of cool characters, and, fortunately for everybody involved, Children of the Whales does just that. Anybody who is a fan of mystery, fantasy, psychological themes, and beautiful artwork should most definitely check this show out!<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
 A quiet and tranquil ship called the Mud Whale full of short-lived psychokinetics and a handful of boring normies with longer lifespans drifts aimlessly on an endless sea of sand. Barring a few troublemakers the people of the Mud Whale are (mostly) happy in what seems to be a utopian commune of sorts. Unexpected contact with the outside world reveals

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262707">
        that things on the Mud Whale are not as simple and benign as they initially seem, and soon the passengers of the Mud Whale are forced to confront a world that doesn&#039;t much resemble the paradise they know. Chakuro (our hero and the archivist of the ship) and his friends must struggle against the pressure of a vast, hostile, and unknown world if they want to continue to live their peaceful lives.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
It&#039;s beautiful, it&#039;s perfect, it looks like Linda Evangelista. This show is gorgeous to look at, and a couple seconds should be enough to convince anybody with working eyes of that fact. It has a muted, watercolor look that keeps the atmosphere very tranquil even when some serious shit starts going down. In fact, the mellow art makes the serious shit all the more serious by comparison. The way this show is drawn and animated would reason enough to watch it even if the story was garbage, and as the story is also great you really have no excuse not to.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The only part of the show that isn&#039;t amazing. It&#039;s good, don&#039;t get me wrong, especially the OP. It&#039;s just not as perfect as the art and the story. Nothing to sneeze at, but certainly nothing to write home about. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Really really good. Chakuro, our main character, is something of a wet blanket at first, but he grows a backbone as the story progresses and he is forced to start standing up for himself and his family. Lykos, a mysterious stranger from abroad, starts off as an emotionally dead husk and fairly quickly becomes a really badass little girl. Kinda like anime Eleven from Stranger Things. Other characters of note include Ouni, the rebellious angsty teenaged shit-stirrer, Sami, the plucky (almost) girlfriend of our protagonist, and Suou, one of the non-psychokenetic individuals on the Mud Whale who is being groomed to become the next chief of the ship. A plethora of side characters, each interesting and dynamic in their own right, help the Mud Whale feel like a lived-in community filled with real people. This, of course, serves to make the fact that they are about to get their shit kicked in all the more tragic.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall:<br />
This show is great. It is going to be a fun and colorful adventure full of complex characters, tough decisions, and really beautifully animated fights, scenery, and characters. The world is cool, the characters are vibrant, the visual is spectacular, and the episodes have a natural dramatic tension that is very exciting to watch unfold. Fans of other awesome fantasy/mysteries like From the New World (Shinsekai Yori), Dennou Coil, Uta Kata, and Made in Abyss will really get a kick out of this show. If you have no idea what any of that stuff is, watch this show anyway. You&#039;ll love it. And then, if you do, watch that other shit too. Cause you&#039;ll like that as well.

    This anime is so unique it could be one of a kind<br />
<br />
Not really anime, not really Chinese cartoon, this story sail between being weird and great. Children of the Whales is a story which could not be for anyone. It appeals and please quite a niche group of people. Nevertheless it did really please me with its unique story and world.<br />
<br />
§§§§ STORY §§§§<br />
So I cant really go deep in the story without spoiling it so I won’t. That would lessen the fun of watching it yourself. Children of the Whales is told form the perspective of Chakuro who occasionally narrates some of his thoughts. It

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344765">
        gives the feeling like you’re being told an tale or good story by the mc himself. For just 12 episodes this anime feels deep and convinces me that there is a lot of lore behind the real storyline. They have funerals, festivals, laws, culture. It all adds up to interesting world building while simultaneously laying the foundation for future events. It really conveys a story rich world and shows that the Whales is more than just a plot device. It is something that lives and breathes. Something where obviously more happened, before we got to see it. I feel it was unjustified to be just 12 episodes and feels like it could have been easily 3 seasons long with the amount of lore unexplored.<br />
The characters aren’t abused up to the point they will just be for tear jerkers or comic relief. They have more purpose, like in the real world. It makes each of the characters stand more out, even if they don’t get much screen time.<br />
I’ve got to say that the pacing is fast but well justified. It doesn’t go in to deep in the history of the Whales, what was disappointing, but it does create a new story for us to be a part of. Luckily it doesn’t drag out unnecessary parts as it feels like you will always move along the story while watching. The fast pacing does leave some information left desired.<br />
<br />
§§§§ ART §§§§<br />
The background felt like Chinese art style with anime characters popping in. It felt so fresh. The easy-going background gave my eyes plenty of rest while still being appealing. I would say that it is one of the strong points of Children of the Whales. I noticed some CG was used for sand and some other effects, but it was blend in so well that it made the anime better looking, rather than an abomination (like most CG scenes).<br />
The character design was simple yet attractive.  It fulfilled the role of “simple looking” on an island without too much tech.<br />
The way thymia was handled was very beautiful. A simple depiction of power while still being very appealing. The rules are simple, more thymia means more power. Luckily there is no stupid thing like instant powerup with mad effects. It was simple and appealing.<br />
<br />
§§§§ CHARACTERS §§§§<br />
We see multiple characters developing and adapting to a changing world. Reactions and actions were taking accordingly if you would think about how the characters were before the invasion. Emotion plays a big role, but that doesn’t really seem prominent at first. It gradually evolves and opens up. You might re-watch it for the sake of understanding the first few episodes. Because I didn’t really understand the world and the characters yet, their reactions ticked me off and I was almost ready to drop it. But when I look back, I think it was really well done.<br />
Im happy the characters don’t act “out of character”. The characters have their own treads and their own strengths and weakness. We get to see Chakuro evolving from slow mc to better mc. Suoh/Souo changes his thinking and decision making, but still remains kind and gentle. Ouni stays badass.<br />
I’m a bit puzzled by Lykos, she wasn’t really easy to read and the story didn’t really support her choices and motivation. I guess she is a nice addon but I feel like she wasn’t really needed. To bad she had to replace a character.<br />
Because the story deviates real quick I’m not discussing the characters in detail, as that would spoil most moments. I would say that they won’t be new characters at the end of the season, but you get to see what makes them move and what moved them. On the other hand, if this would be 24 episodes, they could flesh out just a bit more of character.<br />
<br />
§§§§ MUSIC §§§§<br />
The music is beautiful and does a great job at expressing scenes, guiding the pace and supporting the art in general. The ambient tones fluently changes to upbeat battle style with each changing scene. The scene where Neri (purple lil girl) sings and dance was beautiful but very alienated from the story. It felt theatrical and soothing. It did add some element, yet I puzzled what it exactly added.<br />
The music felt in a way nostalgic, reminding me of something spacious, worldly, yet very close and cozy. I don’t know if this is personal, but I liked it.<br />
<br />
§§§§ FINAL THOUGHTS §§§§<br />
This anime sails between being good and mediocre. Some moments were bright and other were really frustrating. As mentioned earlier I was ready to drop this anime on episode 3 but something etched me to really finish the story and I’m glad I did. It wouldn’t be an anime for many people but in a way it is really artistic. I had some moments where I could see the skill of the story writer, how things turned out or how things are handled. It didn’t feel like there was plot armor and most things played out very natural. Sacrifices are made and somethings are gained from it. I would ship Chakuro and Sami and I hope they will be happy together.<br />
If you would love unique painteresque anime with unique premise and a beautiful evolving story, I would recommend you Children of the Whales! If you like mc who do crazy ass pulls and always push through or clear and predictable story, this isn’t your call. I hope for a sequeal.<br />

    I love everything about this anime. It is probably one of the most interesting, innovative and well-made shoujos I have ever seen in my life. I was anxious to be able to watch it and now I feel that all my expectations are being fulfilled very well. And I&#039;m still being surprised. <br />
<br />
Art (10)<br />
The first thing I wanted to mention about it, is the beauty of the drawing and the color palette. The colors are mostly very soft, pastel tones, giving a more innocent and pure connotation for the protagonist characters. The antagonists, in turn, always receive stronger colors - I found this quite interesting.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263365">
        In addition, colors also direct well the emotions that viewers must feel: sad themes lead to environments in navy blue, joyful themes ranges from an orange rose to all the colors of the rainbow. It&#039;s just beautiful to watch.<br />
<br />
The character traits are all super delicate - from the strands of hair to the minutest details of the eyes, the clothes and even the movement of the wind. Even before the series was released, it was this delicacy that made me super excited to be able to follow the anime. I admit: it is my weakness. The way the studio stayed true to Umeda Abi&#039;s art style made me very happy too. She is a wonderful mangaka. I really, really loved the art.<br />
<br />
Sound (10)<br />
The second thing I wanted to mention is the wonderful soundtrack. A lot of people don&#039;t pay much attention to this kind of detail, but I&#039;m completely in love with the entire OST without even having access to the media yet. It&#039;s the kind of OST that I definitely have the interest to get for my collection. And the ending theme! Oh goddess, I love this song. Rionos&#039; voice is simply angelic, this song always gives me goosebumps. The lyrics of the song are very cute and practically whispered, harmonizing a lot with the soft tone that the anime passes, the idea of ​​purity and sadness. <br />
<br />
Story (9)<br />
The story is a bit hazy at first and is being built slowly, like a puzzle. To the present moment, I am giving it a 9 because I still don&#039;t know the end of it. I hope it continues to surprise me positively. But it&#039;s worth the rate because it&#039;s the kind of plot you normally expect from a shounen manga, an adventure full of tragic and even violent twists.<br />
<br />
Characters (8)<br />
The characters follow a similar path of history: they are all poorly developed. The story focuses on Chakuro, the narrator, but it explores a bit of several other characters, so it leaves little room for deeper development. The viewer knows the names of the characters, whether they are ordinary humans or controllers of thymia and in some cases, a bit of the past of one or another. But yet their emotions - or their lack - are so well worked out that it also thrills you. Again, I hope to continue to be positively surprised in this regard. <br />
<br />
Okay, I may sound a bit partial here because I love their design, but there&#039;s no way you can watch this series and not want to hug Chakuro and protect him from all the malice in the world. They are all just adorable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall (9)<br />
I&#039;m having loads of fun and getting lots of excitement too. I love these silly and delicate stories involving human feelings, thematizing individual freedom, the value of life and friendship. This story is a root shoujo (which means it couldn&#039;t be more original to the genre, I guess)!<br />
<br />
So, if you like shoujo stories like I do, I&#039;m pretty sure you are going to like this one quite much.

    Ok, so I&#039;m not gonna be prejudice and start throwing around facts before the series is even over like everyone else but all I can say 5 episodes in this is one of the greats of the season. If you&#039;re on the fence on watching, let me personally encourage you.<br />
<br />
In a weird way it feels like a game of Civilization - little countries with hidden motives and philosophies, some are stronger than others in debatable aspects and dreaming of expanding your knowledge of the world to truly understand you&#039;re place in it.<br />
<br />
That is all. Watch along this series, it&#039;s looking like it&#039;s already and gonna

    (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)<br />
<br />
Whales are intelligent, majestic creatures. Rulers of the sea by size and by power.<br />
<br />
In comparison, Kujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau has no size. It has no power.<br />
<br />
All it really rules over is the bottom of the ocean – right where it belongs.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Credit where credit is due: Kujira no Kora (as it will be shortened to from here on out) contains a neat premise what with its expanse of sand, an inexplicable titan, and the cultural norms it creates. It at least has the footing necessary to get the ball rolling (or, in this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305747">
        case, get the “boat” rowing).<br />
<br />
But as a narrative, as a story, this whole venture sinks rather than swims.<br />
<br />
Major issues reveal themselves swiftly and without remorse. For instance, the bad guys have a weird tendency to just not really do anything in situations where they clearly have the upper hand, turning specific events into an excuse to push the plot in a certain direction rather than into intense moments that allow it to develop naturally. Moreover, hardly anything is known about these adversaries since the show will go long stretches without talking about them or at least referring to them, missing out on crucial exploration of their side.<br />
<br />
The trading of information also encounters trouble. Characters like Lykos will hold onto vital clues for very little reason other than to obstruct the narrative. Then, in complete opposite fashion, someone like Aima will descend in front of Chakuro to give him her umpteenth example of deus ex machina so that the plot at least “makes sense” when going to its next part.<br />
<br />
Quotes must be used there since Kujira no Kora often treads into nonsensical territory. Random characters, such as the older elders, appear and disappear out of nowhere. Certain interactions, such as Chakuro speaking with one of the Nous directly, involves incredulous logic. Important changes, such as Ouni’s newfound powers, have miniscule impact in the aftermath of their discovery.<br />
<br />
This systemic plague within the writing festers and oozes its way into the more fundamental aspects of the show. An excessive amount of exposition bogs down the flow, and pacing can get too quick which hinders events. There’s also the intermittent comedic relief. It stilts the tone since people are literally dead or dying and such jokey asides clash hard with the serious morbidity.<br />
<br />
Even disregarding the comedy, Kujira no Kora breaks apart with its drama and its action, the areas that make up the bulk of its story.<br />
<br />
On the drama side, it’s tough to care about the loss of life which occurs. It tries to be emotional insofar as those who perish usually represent major figures in the lives of those nearby, but the lacking presence of these people to begin with prevents the drama from landing.<br />
<br />
On the action side, not enough happens to justify the skirmishes. Those who are Marked have essentially magical powers, but their abilities and their usage rarely (if ever) aim for an interesting angle let alone reach memorable status.<br />
<br />
Problem after problem hounds this story nearly every step of the way. It’s largely incompetent, and its premise simply cannot carry the glaring mishaps and the ludicrous inadequacies that weigh it down. This vessel doesn’t just sink; it implodes.<br />
<br />
ART &amp; ANIMATION<br />
<br />
While the show may not recover from the damage to its narrative, Kujira no Kora at least dazzles with the artistry at its disposal.<br />
<br />
Chief among its wonders is the color palate. The anime opts for a watery fade to achieve its softer hues, coinciding with the sea motif and forming the watercolor looks for many of its visuals. It also chooses much lighter colors in general: pinks, teals, yellows. They add a vibrant contrast not only to the darker blues and purples but also to the overall darkness of the mood at hand.<br />
<br />
The rocky outcropping the characters call home also gets attention. Craggy walls and earthen stone encase their lodgings. Rudimentary holes act as rough windows. Quaint amenities line their rooms. Vegetation on other floating islands and the regal cities of the “normal” people have a place, but this monolith of mud and clay captures the rustic intent of the anime.<br />
<br />
Combining the colors and the setting provides the show with ample opportunities to highlight the beauty of this world. Again, it almost never leaves the static ruins of their roaming giant. Yet, when a sunset casts light on their abode or dancing lights flicker in the nighttime air, it becomes easier to forgive the stale variety and to appreciate these gorgeous segments.<br />
<br />
While the art and the artistry often impress, the more nuanced, technical side of things isn’t as captivating. Cinematography remains standard for many of its scenes, and the actual animation during bouts or as they go about their daily lives stays relatively straightforward.<br />
<br />
Kujira no Kora prevails with other details, though. The designs for its characters fit the scope and the lore of their era and their culture as loose clothes, accessories, sandals, and other simplistic garb invoke a native feel to their looks. And above them, a painted, almost canvas-esque sky stays aligned with the painted vibe of the art, granting an awe in all directions.<br />
<br />
Overall, the anime contains some rather good artistry. One can’t complain too much here.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
The characters within Kujira no Kora, however, cannot evade complaints.<br />
<br />
Chakuro takes the helm of this “ship” as the lead star and the narrator, speaking of his account aboard their home and his knowledge of the Falaina people (i.e., his people). However, he’s entirely too passive to be considered a worthwhile character within the anime. Not that being passive is inherently a problem; it’s that that’s all he is.<br />
<br />
He’s a writer at heart, so it’s understandable that he stays on the sidelines during fights (even if he’s apparently a very strong thymia user) since he has little in the way of battle training. But he contributes almost nothing else. He watches events play out, and he cries a lot, yet he just laments the situation and goes along with nearly everything that happens around him.<br />
<br />
Deaths of dear friends do affect him, so he’s at least attuned with the gravity of their dilemma. That’s not saying a whole lot, however, when he won’t speak up even if he knows the causes behind it. Worse yet, Chakuro will constantly talk about wishing to record the stories of his people for historical purposes episode after episode, but his progress on this front must be minimal because Kujira no Kora rarely showcases him doing as such. I.e., he talks the talk but does not walk the walk.<br />
<br />
Chakuro is so bland and so useless that it’s a miracle to see him connected to this story whatsoever. Lykos is a walking blob of a character, too. She begins as a blank slate of sorts, harboring almost zero emotion when Chakuro and the others find her. Meaning, the anime primes her for an interesting arc to follow throughout the season.<br />
<br />
True to its trends, though, Lykos succumbs to the same problems of overt passivity and minute contributions. She receives a tiny bit of backstory near her introduction, and she’s related to the main baddy, but the extent of her presence stops there. She barely says or does anything meaningful despite her growing emotions.<br />
<br />
Lykos maybe-possibly develops feelings for Chakuro, indicating her recent changes on a psychological level. Sadly, their relationship neither goes anywhere meaningful, has a resolute foundation, nor is challenged to any significant extent. That is to say, just as they are individually depleted as characters, the bond they share turns hallow as well.<br />
<br />
Besides these two leads, Kujira no Kora includes side characters who likewise fail to meet a proper spot. Shuan, the eyepatch guy, is the outlier amongst everyone insofar as he cares not for anything, including (apparently) his own wife. But he’s almost too much of an outsider, leading his small asides to register as inconsequential moments without much follow-through. Then there’s the purple-hair goofball who gets some pretty vital backstory right before a key scene in his arc. It demonstrates a complete lameness in the character writing, aggravated further by his absurd motivations.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the only two notable characters in the show are Suou and Ouni.<br />
<br />
Suou becomes the voice of reason whose nonviolent ideologies struggle against the fear and the hatred which brews in the hearts of his fellow thymia users. He’s the anchor of hope that the rest of the characters look up to, a mature person who himself has a lot left to learn. As a supporting character, he’s at least beneficial to the ensuing plot.<br />
<br />
Ouni is arguably the most well-written character in Kujira no Kora, but it’s still a weak and precarious backing. The anime sets up him as a conflicted anti-hero who inspires everyone to fight back and who cares deeply for the misfits he has befriended over the years. His never-ending angst and his much-to-be-desired backstory don’t do him any favors, but the personal troubles he endures push him down the right path. A statement that cannot be said for the other two main characters.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Suou and Ouni find themselves drowned out by a mixed bag of other additions to the cast. Sami enlightens the audience to the harshness of their world, Hakuji shows how people can redeem themselves yet, and Masoo reminds everyone of the unfair toll they have burdened. On the opposite side, Oruka is an annoyingly blasé villain in need of depth, and the latecomers from the new country arrive way too late indeed.<br />
<br />
For these characters, it’s mostly just a wash.<br />
<br />
MUSIC &amp; SOUND<br />
<br />
A cleansing of the audio is also required for Kujira no Kora.<br />
<br />
At the minimum, its opening track “Sono Saki e” harbors a hefty emotional tone that strikes at the bittersweet layer permeated throughout the anime. The tender female vocals and the light acoustic guitar strings work in unison to meld this mood, relying on the drums and the shakers for a steady rhythm. It’s perhaps slightly repetitive in its structure, but poignant delivery for many of its lyrics supplant this grievance.<br />
<br />
The tail end of each episode brings the ending track “Hashitairo”, another song aiming for that bittersweet tone. However, it dives into it with more gusto. Female vocals and acoustic guitar strings return alongside piano keys, extra backing vocals, and violins to emphasize the bitter half of the term. Unlike the OP, this ED skirts around repetition, yet the middle section of the track meanders to a questionable degree. Still, the poetic, story-like lyrics introduce a complexity that befits the song’s equally complex emotions.<br />
<br />
While neither the OP nor the ED stand out as too impressive, they at least do not go down the contemptable route of its semi-insert songs. Over the course of Kujira no Kora, a few musical numbers per se pop up to crescendo as sweeping emotional points in the story. Per usual, though, they fall flat. Sometimes they’re way too out of place, like as the prelude to a battle about to commence. Sometimes they’re too methodical, like as the beginning of the end to the story’s conclusion. Whether melancholic or uplifting in nature, these songs are easily the worst audio decisions in the anime.<br />
<br />
The majority of the rest of the audio elements simply pass the mark. Heavy cellos and quicker instrumentation coincide with the somber and tenser parts of the anime (respectively), but the collection of tracks it touts leave behind nothing all that memorable. The voice-acting performances similarly lose out on any standout mentions. And the sound-effects, regardless of the thymia possibilities, remain par for the course.<br />
<br />
In short, the music and the sound fairs slightly better than the other aspects of Kujira no Kora, but it ends up in the red anyway.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
To say I disliked this anime would be an understatement.<br />
<br />
The weaknesses throughout the season were already enough to make it a soured and sorrowful experience, but the anime goes that extra step further with some more baffling choices. Key among them involves a certain purple-hair antagonistic who shall go unnamed still for being absolutely insufferable.<br />
<br />
Jim Carrey as the Grinch put it best: “Loathe entirely” describes this annoying, eye-rolling, grating nuisance of a character (intentional or not). Yet the show steps it up again by making him into a literal personal jester later on, increasing his loathsome behavior to another level after what should have been his leave. He pretty much deserved such a fate for being a psychopathic lunatic, but, having hit maximum on the hated scale beforehand, he breaks it afterwards. He has now become one of my least favorite characters I’ve ever had the displeasure of viewing onscreen, and I pray I never have to see him mentioned anywhere ever again.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I couldn’t take the anime very seriously at all. There’s a distinct part in episode five that is one of the most unintentionally hilarious moments I’ve ever seen in a long time, if not ever. The Nous creature gets hit by an arrow, and its reaction is priceless. The scream, the eyes, the camera zooming in and out. It was a trifecta of funny that wasn’t meant to be so but got there anyway.<br />
<br />
Also why would throwing sand at each other equate to a worthwhile pastime for these stranded people? I get that they must be bored out of their minds out there, but the fact that nobody seems to question such a dangerous activity comes off as irrational.<br />
<br />
Maybe I’m being nitpicky over such a tiny detail, but it just goes to show how frustrating this whole project ended up being for me. It’s empty. It’s inane to watch. It’s borderline bottom of the barrel.<br />
<br />
When this one did finally wrap up, it boldly declared that, “The journey will continue.” I can acknowledge its confidence for future success – but that’s as far as I’m willing to extend my olive branch.<br />
<br />
Kujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau fails miserably. Like a golden toilet, it shines on the outside thanks to its beautiful art, but, on the inside, it contains excrement in the form of poor narrative writing, odd musical choices, lame characters, and unappealing entertainment. A whale of a time it is not.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Terrible, a ridiculous enemy, improper plot handling, nonsensical happenings, fundamental problems, and an uninteresting direction sink its maiden voyage<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation: Good, vibrant colors and a painted style give the visuals a gorgeous look even if the more technical traits like cinematography and movement do not impress<br />
<br />
Characters: Bad, Chakuro and Lykos are horrible protagonists, Suou and Ouni have a mediocre presence, and the remaining supporting and extra cast members lean towards the weak, negative side<br />
<br />
Music &amp; Sound: Bad, the OP and the ED demonstrate emotion, but the absurd singing moments and the rest of the lackluster audio elements fail to contribute<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Terrible, has one of the most annoying characters ever seen, laughable when it doesn’t intend to be, and increasingly frustrating the further along it proceeds<br />
<br />
Final Score: 2/10

    Children of the Mud Whale is a beautiful show with an interesting world that is a complete waste of time. Most of us watched it for the pretty background art and fascinating concept, but it fails miserably to deliver on these.<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
3 is a bit generous and is there solely because of 1) a death early on that caught me by surprise, and 2) the world building. Mud Whale has an interesting world, with whale/ships powered by grotesque monstrosities on a sand ocean. There&#039;s an evil empire and other kingdoms scattered around, it all seems like it should be really entertaining but it just isn&#039;t.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266411">
        The direction is awful, it feels like they didn&#039;t take their episode numbers into account at all. A third party that intends to ally with the Mud Whale shows up at random in one episode and just hangs out with them for the rest of the series, not affecting anything. Information is doled out whenever the show feels like it and characters are introduced and killed off in bulk. <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The art is where this show excels. The background art is beautiful, the world looks interesting and fun. You want to learn more about the unique society on the mud whale, their specific customs that they&#039;ve developed from their years in isolation, the world they inhabit. Where it fails is the action direction. Emotionless enemy soldiers wait their turn to attack the helpless and allow themselves to be mowed down for no reason. There is a scene where a weakened old man is able to kill two soldiers by stumbling into them off a cliff, after they&#039;d already cut a gash into his chest. Why they didn&#039;t get out of the way is behind comprehension. The show doesn&#039;t look bad necessarily in motion but it&#039;s nothing impressive. It&#039;ll get you some nice screenshots though.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
I&#039;ve got a terrible memory when it comes to background music and OP/ED themes. There is, however, a memorable scene in one of the episodes where a character sings a song amidst a battle and it&#039;s genuinely beautiful. It briefly revived my hope in this series before it was beaten back into the sand.<br />
<br />
Characters: 1<br />
The characters are the worst part of this show. <br />
Chakuro - the main character who doesn&#039;t feel like a main character. He&#039;s described as an archivist but this aspect of his personality is so underdeveloped that I genuinely forgot that that was his job until a character referred to him as &quot;Archivist of Falaina.&quot; On top of that he&#039;s a weak, ineffectual crybaby who, unlike better crybabies like Deku from My Hero Academia, never gets better. <br />
Lykos - she literally had the emotions sucked out of her prior to the series and it shows. She&#039;s quiet and mopey, refusing to give potentially crucial information until the end of the series despite having it the entire time. <br />
Ouni - The only decent character. I think he even exhibits character development, but my god is he not enough to save this section of the review, let alone the entire show. <br />
The main issue is, as I mentioned before, that they introduce characters at random. &quot;Oh this character&#039;s going on a potentially dangerous mission? Give him a best friend who wants to come with.&quot; &quot;Hm... there&#039;s not enough internal strife, let&#039;s introduce two new characters who literally explain away their absence with a &#039;we&#039;ve stuck to the edges of the Mud Whale til now&#039; as if that excuses their delayed introduction and have them stir things up&quot; They&#039;re reluctant to kill off important characters so they invent new characters whenever they want and throw them in the story, hoping to eke out some emotional payoff. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2<br />
There are just enough pretty moments to edge this series above a 1 for enjoyment. It&#039;s not fun to watch, it&#039;s really boring even during the action. The fact that they introduce new characters just to kill them off destroys any tension once you know who&#039;s going to survive. There are about 2 deaths with any real impact, and even then only the first one is felt by the viewer. The penalty for the magic system that the characters have is short lifespans, which is a totally ineffectual penalty. Sure the older characters are likely to die, chances are it won&#039;t affect anyone you really care about for another few years, and it&#039;s difficult to care about these characters anyway because they just don&#039;t do much. <br />
<br />
Overall: 3<br />
Children of the Mud Whale is a bad show. It&#039;s a pretty show, but it&#039;s bad. The art and sound keep it from being a 1 or a 2 but they are not enough to give it an even passable score. This is, after all, an anime, not an art book.

    Kujira No Kora is beautiful anime in all senses! I realize not everyone will like, because it’s quite a sensitive story; it’s that kind of story which leaves you, at the end, with lots of tears. The story is quite interesting too – it’s filled with a magical world and mysteries; so, I’m sure if you start watching it, you’ll end up watching all episodes in a row, considering how much addictive the show is. I need to be sincere with you guys: the show is really interesting, but the story has some inconsistencies; it’s a shoujo show, but, as far as I’m concerned it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274000">
        ends up being too shoujo – to the point where the story becomes unrealistic, at times, because the show follows rigorously the “shoujo criteria”. Everything said, you’ll love the show, so don’t hold back and just watch it right away! It’s on Netflix, after all, come on, guys!<br />
<br />
[Story: 7/10]<br />
[SPOILERS ALERT] There are minor spoilers ahead, otherwise it’s really hard to write this review: but don’t worry, they’re not anything which will make a difference when you’ll watch the anime. Also, review big AF ahead.<br />
Kujira No Kora has a marvelous universe construction, you’ll be dumbfounded by how well constructed it was. The story is based in a utopic island which moves around a sea of sand – and, yes, in the story the sea is made of sand: it’s not a figure of language. The island has a small community living within it; to them, that’s their entire world, for they have no idea of the world which exists out there. It seems that utopic island Thomas More wrote about: everything is beautiful, everyone is an equal (well, almost everyone) and all of the people live their lives with no worries and no violence (it’s almost as if they don’t know what violence is).<br />
That said, there’s something which divides people in two groups: the ability to use a power called “thymia”. Ninety percent of the people can use it – being known, then, as the Marked; the other ten percent can’t use it – being known then as the Unmarked. A board of Unmarked elders hold the political reins of the island; however, the work is divided equally among everyone – even among the Unmarked. So, in this sense, is almost as if that island represented a communist system (if not for the difference in political power among the Marked and Unmarked, but the Marked have super powers; so, I guess that makes them equal lol).<br />
The people who live in the island are different from the people from their ex-homeland: while they can feel such stronghearted, tear dropping, breathtaking feELiNgS, the people from the outside world don’t have feELiNgS. Now, I can begin to show how incredibly intelligent the show is: I see as a portrayal of our world if it were to become a dystopia (in a way it already is if we stop to think about it). And it’s really interesting how you start the show thinking it’s a utopia but, in the end, you realize it’s a dystopia. In this universe, it came a time in human history when humans deemed emotions could only get in the way, so it’d be better to live without them; therefore, they became heartless soldiers. The people in the island can only live this perfect, utopic life in the island, because they ignore the outside world. And it’s really interesting to see, as the show progresses, that some people in the island, who have emotions, can be really cruel at times – so, they are just hypocrites pointing their fingers to the outsiders, who don’t have emotions, and calling them “monsters”. Regarding the outsiders, it’s exposed how far it came the human stupidity to think it’d be better to live in a world without emotions.<br />
So, the brilliance of the show lies this portrayal of us, of how far the human stupidity can go and of how deluded we can become, unable to see our own hypocrisy. Also, the brilliance lies in the way the show can demonstrate emotions in such a stronghearted, tear dropping, breathtaking way. It just kills me how I ended the show soaking wet with my tears. I’d give a 10 for the story, if not for the inconsistencies; nonetheless, it’s an amazing show.<br />
<br />
[Art: 10]<br />
The direction of art is splendid! The island is so beautifully constructed visually that it only can aid the understanding that is a little perfect world! The art is so well done that it really makes you think that island is a utopia. The art is so good that I’d watch the show just for the art. That’s how good it is.<br />
[Sound: 10]<br />
It’s rare to watch an anime with an orchestrated soundtrack; just that considered makes the sound of the anime incredible. But besides being orchestrated, the melodies are heavenly, really, they’re heavenly! When you hear that beautiful music, you’ll believe that island is not only a utopia, but it’s heaven. Not to mention the few songs in the show, sung by the own characters, have such a good lyric and carry such a huge emotion that when you start listening, you’ll cry immediately.<br />
<br />
[Character: 7)<br />
As I’ve said above, the show can be really, really shoujo – which, on one side, make it amazing to watch all of those guys with emotions blurting out of their skin acting so passionately around other guys (and girls); but, on the other side, it makes the show unrealistic: Suou and Chakuro, for example, are so kind and passionate that their behavior, at times, is just ridiculous (though, most of the time is just tear dropping). Many characters lack depth while some are really deep and well-constructed; so, if you forgive that and the inconsistencies, I can grant you’ll have a great time filled with tears watching the anime. <br />
As I’ve said above, this kind of show is not for everyone, but, in my opinion, the best shows are the ones filled with passion, I’m sorry not sorry. <br />
<br />
[Enjoyment: 10] and [Overall: 8.8]<br />
I’ve spoken so much about the show in this review that I guess it’s enough (and obvious) to say, with all of its faults, you’ll love the show. It’s like a son or a daughter (I imagine, for God’s sake I don’t want one now): you’ll love anyway, so just watch the show.<br />
I’m sorry for the long review, believe me, I’m tired of reading it as well, so I get you.<br />

    On paper, Kujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau, or Children Of The Whales, seems promising at first glance, but on screen, as you follow the story of people learning to disregard their emotions (LITERALLY being kuuderes) as a means to survive in a place full of contraptions and controversies amidst the fast-pacing that it has, it becomes over and underwhelming of the overall production value in and itself.<br />
<br />
Story &amp; Characters:<br />
In a world of humans, more specifically the land of Falaina, the sinner&#039;s land, people are categorized as Unmarked and Marked according to whether thymia exists within them (which act as their superpowers), with the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266431">
        Unmarked having none of that thymia while being able to live longer and the Marked having thymia but with a shorter lifespan. And the third realm, the rare Daimon (Ouni&#039;s power) is able to inflict great power while also being able to live for long.<br />
<br />
This is a journey of the Mud Whale and its archivist, our MC 14 year-old Chakuro exploring the realms of Falaina, learning its actions and discoveries...until the encountering of another country with another MC Lykos, which she is a kuudere since the Nous (heart of the ships) has sucked the emotions out of the people, and has become deaf towards emotions and won&#039;t sound out towards the Mud Whale people.<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s where the problem starts, as the intro towards Lykos meant that the people of Falaina (particularly the main protagonist Ouni and his band of mercenaries) knew that they aren&#039;t alone, the Empire Strikes Back (get the pun?) with a slew of side characters from both the Empire (the Skylos ship) and the Mud Whale fighting against each other, like as if the scenes are there for you to get emotionally drifted with whatever the storyline goes, but it doesn&#039;t work for me, even as a very emotional person, it doesn&#039;t captivate me as much as other shows have had done in their own unique way that really stands out.<br />
<br />
Even worse, most notably characters like the annoying no-mercy pink-haired Ryodari just doesn&#039;t work out for me, it&#039;s like &quot;Can someone please eliminate this bastard once and for all!?&quot;, and the unrequited lover Sami that has an affection for Chakuro, only to be his sacrifice, IN TURN which is supposed to repress the emotions of Chakuro and us the audience.<br />
<br />
So overall, while the story presentation does have flaws in which the insane amount of characters make up for it, the execution however feels mildly presentable at its finest and becomes a horrible mess towards the end, where I find myself scratching my head always to understand what the hell is going on here towards the ending.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation:<br />
One thing I can give credit to J.C.Staff for is that cel-shading art and glorious animation, because there is really nothing like it out there, and it sticks out with it having one of the best productions that they have done over the years, and really that&#039;s no consolation for the entirety of the show overall, because the potentials given and shown here just makes up for the lackluster storytelling, and there in itself, presents another problem to an already existing problem on hand. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
to be honest, I&#039;m not fond of the OST here, and since this show displays a barrage of emotions, the OP and ED are there to introduce you to a realistic feeling of emotions when used well and otherwise. The BGM does a decent job in fulfilling and showcasing the characters at their highs and lows and for the intense and solemn moments of joy and despair. Sadly, the ED is the only good point which I can say it&#039;s nice to listen to, even though some will disagree with that.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
The make-or-break part is with the ending &quot;the journey with continue&quot; (Spoilers alert) on whether J.C.Staff will continue with another season to clearify all the loopholes and misunderstandings that we have with this series as a whole, because so far, this has been a very jam-packed series, with the manga counterpart still ongoing, and it&#039;s like ending on a note that&#039;s not even far from what we feel is the &quot;true&quot; ending.<br />
<br />
On this note however, if you&#039;re willing to try this show out, just go in with a mysterious feel, and don&#039;t expect much from something that at one point, may have your heartstrings pulled and another, just to wreck that ball of emotions away. Decent, but not entertaining to re-watch this again.

    One must truly understand, to a profound degree, the duality of the nature of life to fully appreciate this anime and all it has to offer this world. If this is you, as it is me, then this will likely become your favorite anime. I sincerely hope it comes back for a second season, though certainly not at the expense of the delivery of its message. Truly a masterpiece, as it stands.<br />

    Watch this anime if you cannot decide what to watch or have a lot of time. Give it a try but don&#039;t expect too much  <br />
<br />
Almost no character development and too slow paced for a 12 episode anime. It is hard to relate to any of the characters or to see the meaning behind their actions. <br />
The anime has a lot of potential but failed to keep me excited about the next episode. <br />
Now about the main character: his whole existence and significance is based on his overly idealistic emotional personality to follow what he believe is right.<br />
<br />
The plot is somehow adapted to 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263810">

    Seriously I can&#039;t take the way characters handled their problems, things would have been much easier if they told others what&#039;s going on. In my eyes, they all seem like idiots, who lack the brain to think probably. For example, if you can&#039;t understand what I mean, they could have told everyone on the island that the Elders are trying to sink the island. Other than this I would say the story itself is pretty interesting, despite those retardedness actions taken by the characters. The art is also pretty good, so as the music. <br />
It&#039;s something decent to watch with your brain turned off, but

    I am in despair. For the first time in a long time I am actually sad that an anime has gone this poorly. I had hopes that Children of Whales (KujiKora for short) could be a little gem of an anime. JC Staff are an animation studio that have probably been the most consistent studio in all of Japan and have given us some incredible classics like Nodame and Hachimitsu as well as some great contemporary works like Sakurasou and Raildex. I had hope that this anime would be able to join their echelons. Fantasy is a genre that I have hardly explored but this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307654">
        show had so much promise to introduce to me a whole new, wonderful world with a smooth, slow, purposeful story that took you in with beautiful imagery and charming characters. That was my hope. And it was shattered. <br />
<br />
WARNING: DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE ANIME, THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS.<br />
<br />
KujiKora is set in a world with a gargantuan ocean of sand. We follow the experiences of people living on a large ship made of mud which is called a &quot;whale&quot; which is where our title comes from. The story is told mainly through the eyes of Chakuro - a young archivist living on the ship with several hundred others. Some people - our MC included - possess telekinetic powers called Thymia and are &quot;Marked&quot;. In exchange for this power they live relatively short lives, rarely going past 30. The ship and its residents have been aimlessly adrift for nearly a hundred years and have never encountered any other people. Whenever another mud ship drifts into view and range, they send people to see whether there is anyone on board as well as to scavenge. There is never anyone on board these rarely encountered foreign ships but, one day, the scavenger group - our MC included - find a girl who turns out to be a soldier for a large empire who sent their own ships to attack and sink their mud ship for reasons that are explained latter into the anime. Thus, begins our thrilling adventure of drama ad suspense while figuring out the secrets of the world.<br />
<br />
Problem #1: Too many characters<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a lot of characters in this anime. And I mean a lot. There are about thirty or so named characters in the show. It isn&#039;t an inherently bad thing that a show has a crap ton of characters in it. Shirobako, for instance, has about twice as many named characters in twice as many episodes and turned out great. Kujikora, however, struggles to juggle between all the characters. A lot of the characters have way too much screen time despite hardly being tertiary characters. It gets so bad that the actual main characters of the show have almost no screen time despite them being the point-of-view characters of the story. The anime does kill of quite a lot of its characters and these are often the characters the anime pushes us to try and form an emotional bond with despite us hardly even knowing them. The anime is simply inept at trying to develop these characters since most of them have one-note personalities and only last around two or three episodes if they&#039;re lucky. This makes their existence feel so shallow and I could hardly muster up the energy to feel anything for them. It just feels so cheap. So high is the frequency of the show killing off characters that you just know who has a death flag on them. There&#039;s a lot I can list - more so than I want - but one of the most egregious is in the beginning where they kill off the MC&#039;s &quot;love interest&quot;. We hardly know anything about her and her entire character is that she loved the MC. That&#039;s it. But the anime constantly brings us back to her and her sad story - especially in the first half - that she got annoying fast. Another egregious example would be Ouni&#039;s friend who gets offed simply to become a plot convenience to &quot;unlock&quot; Ouni&#039;s power as well as to give some cheap backstory which I hardly cared about because he was introduced literally 2 episodes prior. Trust me, these characters might sound like big deals but they really aren’t since so many of them pop up. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s another part of the problem: new characters are often introduced seemingly on a whim and they constantly do this throughout the very small number of episodes. A lot of them either end up doing nothing, do very little to further the plot, or and up making the whole thing a lot worse simply by their existence. I understand that this anime is adapted from a manga and that these characters will probably become relevant latter on in the story but in the anime it just feels intrusive. One of the most egregious examples of this happening occurs in episode 8 where two blokes whom we were only introduced to a few episodes prior, and whom were never alluded to – nor had more than 5 minutes of screen time, suddenly came out looking all important and demanding a rebellion of the Marked against the Unmarked. Not only was this conflict never expanded upon or alluded to in any previous episode (something I’ll expand on latter), but these characters were incredibly one-dimensional. The anime expected me to somehow invest myself in them and the conflict but I just cringed throughout the scene. This haphazard and disregard of characters ruins the pacing of the show. It also makes it so that hardly any of the characters have time to develop past their shallow personalities. This ties in with the second problem I have with the show-<br />
<br />
Problem #2: Poor character writing<br />
<br />
As I’ve explained, none of the characters are particularly interesting. This extends from the most insignificant of side characters to the main characters as well as affecting the whole spectrum of bad guys to good guys. The anime’s attempts to make characters be multi-layered and complex end up doing it more harm than good since the show struggles with timekeeping. There are 3 main characters listed on the MAL page for this show but I swear that Suou has the most screentime and he supposedly has a supporting role. The MC is (supposed to be) Chakuro who did have some decent scenes in the first half and had a lot of promise to develop into a stronger, more assertive character after going through all the shit he’s been through. Unfortunately, he hardly changes from his meek attitude he displays at the beginning of the show. This is likely because the creators of the show wanted to contrast him with our other male MC – Ouni. This guy is supposed to the be sort of an edgy anti-villain protagonist with the big power and only helps out the other characters begrudgingly. He unfortunately has very little personality to speak of. His character is reactionary and he never seems to do things on his own violation. Instead, the anime seems to be forcing him to go through with almost all of his actions all for the sake of furthering their shaky plot.  This saddens me since he’s the one with the most motivation in the story. He has a bond with a group of friends whom he considers dear to him, he desires to get off the ship and explore the world, and he has huge power which can have a whole arc built around it. Any of those things could have served as the main driving point for his development but the anime flip flaps between them and never gives him any solid ground on which to build his actions upon. To be fair, his group is made up of a bunch of boring, bland characters who, as explained in problem #1, take up far more screen time than necessary. So, like our first main character, he never really develops at all and seems to be there for the sake of being there. Our third main character is Lykos – the girl who was found on the abandoned ship. She’s kind of alight. She has the second most motivation (and potential) in the show and she doesn’t waste all of it. She serves as the emotionless foil to the emotion-driven people on the mud whale as well as providing a lot of insight in to the world of KujiKora. Her development is the most natural but (I feel like I’m saying “but” way too many times in this review) the anime writes her in such stupid situations it’s sad. In any other anime she’d be forgettable but here, she’s pretty good. Our last character of note is Suou – who isn’t but might as well be a main character. He serves as the Chief of the people on the mud ship and is supposed to be the leader type of guy who takes on responsibility and such. He’s a boring character who also never develops but I feel that he should have been the main character from who’s eyes the story is told from. The anime wastes a lot of his potential wither on melodrama or stupid slapstick comedy (problem #3 coming up) and he has very little impact on the story despite being the goddamn Chief of the place. The story always seems to blow straight past him which is a bit of a shame since he has the second most development.<br />

The villains of KujiKora are hilariously bad. The main one we’ll be seeing is the anime’s attempt at making a crazy character – Liontari. He’s basically someone who failed the audition to become the main character of Neo Yokio and after seeing he lost to Jaden Smith, he went mad and joined the army just to kill some people. That was a joke but it’s still a better, and more impactful, motivation than he was given in the show. What a shame as well since I think Liontari would fit in perfectly in the comedy genre that is Neo Yokio because I for the love of me can’t take him seriously. He’s the anime’s attempt at making a sympathetic villain and he’s given a lot of backstory and such as to why he’s the crazy guy he is. The anime, however, can’t make him imposing in any sort of way and he instead comes off as a comedic villain while he’s busy doing really despicable things. That sort of mood dissonance is not healthy for the body I’ll tell you that. His “development” comes late and feels very rushed and contrived. He, like many of the other characters, has a lot of potential in character interactions but he’s never really given any chance to change or anything. The worst part is that he’s got almost as much plot armour as Brie Larson and seemingly can’t be killed off. He sticks around with us like a zit and overstays his welcome up to the very end in the anime’s attempt to bait a second season. I would love to say he’s the only villain of the show since it would beneficially limit the conflict and world of KujiKora to only him and his fellow soldiers and the people on the mud ship. The anime can then be free to make express it’s themes on a much larger scale than the physical setting it is built up on. Uuuuunfortunately (I’m also using that word a lot in this review) this anime tries to make its world on a scale as large as the themes it tries to present. The world building problems will be explained in problem #4 but I’ll explain the crappy side effect that is the overarching main villain of the show. The main villain is introduced early on but only gets proper writing very late into the show. And I mean around episode 10 kind of late. He’s just your generic villain who the anime tries to make imposing but he has so little time to develop. Again, this is likely the anime baiting us a second season, or telling us to screw off and read the manga – both things which are big problems in their own right. His actual character doesn’t bother me too much – he’s simply your generic bad guy as I’ve said. What does bother me is that his very presence is detrimental to the show. The introduction of a much grander conflict so late into the show blasts away what was left of the pacing beforehand and he introduces us to the incredibly boring world of politics. The anime should never have adapted his part in and probably should have ended just before his big introduction. <br />
<br />
<br />
Problem #3: Tone deafness<br />
<br />
This anime has a big problem with its tone. It just can’t keep anything straight. There are many parts in the show where serious exposition is being delivered but then they have many of the (useless) side characters start cracking jokes. They don’t even bother changing the serious music. This is a result of the anime trying way too hard to juggle about a dozen different themes that it clearly couldn’t in just 12 episodes. Many themes are introduced throughout the show including but not limited to: horrors of war, the conscription of children to fight out of desperation, what it means to kill someone, not running away from a cursed fate, how having emotions is better, wanting to explore the outside world and rebel against a closed society (basically Ouni&#039;s character in a nutshell), love and grief, the burden of revenge as well as taking on responsibility, the importance of leaving behind records for future generations to find etc. That was long but trust me it feels longer watching the anime try and play out these themes. It feels very disorienting whenever they bring up these serious questions and themes before immediately dropping them in favour of another. It makes everything feel so inconsequential. For example, the people on the mud whale have to conscript little children to fight against the invading force sent to slaughter them. That is one thing but the other is that this is supposed to be a peaceful society who has never seen fighting the entire century they have been adrift AND the explicitly go out of their way to teach people not to use their powers to hurt others. What I expected was a sort of commentary on the desperation of the people and how being forced to use innocent children to fight can be a hopeless situation. But no. These kids are all too happy to shoot arrows and kill the faceless goons. Heck, they even have fun while they’re at it. They don’t address it either. They just SHOW them having fun killing the goons. There are no repercussions for the kids. There are absolutely no consequences for the people who basically forced the kids to kill. None. The worse the adults get is that they feel guilty about it while deliberating on the conscription. The anime just sweeps it away once it is done and offers nothing deeper to think about. <br />
<br />
Problem #4: Lack of coherent story telling<br />
<br />
All the various problems with the characters and its themes lead to the storytelling being completely shot. There is almost a total disregard for pacing in the show thanks to the numerous characters being poorly introduced. Things either crawl at a snail’s pace or they give you whiplash with random new developments. This is especially prevalent near the end when we are suddenly whisked away to the random Empire that is trying to sink our main characters. It suddenly introduces politics in an anime that was never good at politics in the first place. There are way too many plot contrivances in this anime and there’s very little foreshadowing of anything that is to happen. Stuff like the furrball pet suddenly being an important plot point feels ridiculously hammed in because the writers wrote themselves into a corner and couldn’t think of a way to move the plot forward. The stupid friend of Ouni being stupid and wanting to go on the trip felt so inauthentic that I was bashing my head against the desk at the anime’s sheer bravado at trying to move the story forward with such an obvious death flag. It feels like the people writing this show had to refer to a set of guidelines when writing this show instead of actually thinking about the actions and consequences of the story.<br />
<br />
#5 Final thoughts (aka tl;dr)<br />
<br />
This anime is not good. The themes are messy and are all over the place, the characters are uninteresting, there’s too many characters, the anime tries to gobble up way more than it could, and the story itself is somewhat generic and one I’ve seen in better fantasy settings. This anime reminds me of Shinsekai Yori. Shinsekai Yori, in case you’ve never watched it, is not a particularly well-written show. It struggles with pacing, there’s a lot of characters I didn’t care much about, the themes were messy – very much like KujiKora. The characters having powers is also a major similarity. So why do I give that a 7/10 and this a 3/10? Shinsekai Yori actually manages to create a world I became invested in. It did this by turning many of its faults into points that drove the anime forward. Lack of pacing? It doesn’t care. Use that infamous exposition episode to naturally build the world. Less-than-stellar character writing? Don’t make characters play very important roles and sideline them which makes the feeling of desperation when shit hits the fan all the more full of dread. Shinsekai Yori managed to create a cohesive world that made sense and feels like it has rules. KujiKora simply feels confused at what its supposed to do and can’t remember any of the groundwork of rules on which it is built upon. It fails at being a compelling, densely-themed story and it fails at building a proper word of fantasy. I have never been so disappointed watching an anime. <br />
<br />
KujiKora should serve as a warning to any prospective writers that you should never try to bite off way more than you could chew. Harsh criticisms aside this anime really had a lot of potential. This incoherent mess does have a lot of things that I would like if they did them right. I love a good fantasy show and was hugely expecting this anime – especially since it came from one of the most consistent studios in the past two decades. This anime, however, is not what they should be doing. <br />

    This show is a massive disappointment on almost every level, excluding the art.<br />
<br />
This is a show that acts like it has a lot of meaning and good characters and an amazing epic story, but in reality, it is just terrible.<br />
<br />
This show kills pretty much every character except for like a handful, but they try to make most of these deaths seem important and try to to get you to be emotional or feel something for the characters, but it falls so hard on its face. Not a single death except for the first one is even remotely sad or emotional. Even when they have a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266051">
        long death sequence to show how much two characters cared for each other, it just doesn&#039;t work. If every character was treated like an important character and given time and more than 12 episodes to develop, I might like this considerably more, but they aren&#039;t so every death is kind of just like &quot;Ok so he&#039;s dead now, cool I guess?&quot; because none of the characters that die are properly given any screen time or relevance or dialogue or backstory or anything at all except for the episode of, or maybe the episode before, their death.<br />
All of this eventually grates on you and is EXCRUCIATINGLY boring. The mechanics of the emotion sucking things that power the ships are completely stupid and have very limited explanation as to what exactly their powers are.<br />
There is also a song scene later in the show that kind of got on my nerves because the show was acting like this was a massive moment with tons of crazy tension and build up. It was kind of tooting its own horn a little by thinking that this scene was so important and tense that a song sung by some random little girl dancing in the sand ocean would be necessary and feel heavy and important. Of course, the scene runs for too long and is also boring because it is impossible to care about anything that is going on by that point.<br />
<br />
Please for your own sanity don&#039;t watch this rushed and painfully boring pretty-looking garbage fire. Thanks for reading.

    This anime is the definition of &quot;Trying too hard.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lets start with the story: On the surface its actually a decent concept. In fact, if there was more world to explore it could be quite enjoyable. Instead, the first two episodes are 25 minute expositions that end up doing nothing for the story overall. <br />
<br />
From that point on the story attempts to pull heart-strings by delving into the debate of logic vs. emotion, and exploiting the death of children to really drive home the point of how gut-wrenching the story is. <br />
<br />
All in all the story ends up going nowhere while attempting to paint itself

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274870">
        as some kind of amazing piece of art. In short: skip this anime if you can. Its not worth it. <br />
<br />
Art; I will say that I did enjoy the background art. I do enjoy a unique look, but its completely thrown off by the same-face animation style that has taken over anime in the last 10 years. Netflix itself has a bad habit of using sub-par animation, and this is no exception. While I can&#039;t get past the animation of the characters, I will give credit to the background images. They were well done and really gave the world life. <br />
<br />
Overall: Abandon the  mud whale. Not worth the time or energy that went into it.

    A bizarre world building ended a tragic and epitome of disjointed plot<br />
<br />
As referring set of tragedy events behind the story which lies under the beneath catalyst breach of such unspoken some more less detail never detain an interior crappy edgy tone vibes.<br />
<br />
In depths between an example of Dante&#039;s Comedy but with a common poison<br />
A structure which bases on an imagining contents in a form of writing directs <br />
unnecessary gibberish drawn out of context grandiose tale without based to the point of existentialism behind the drastic factual and careful disregarded recyclable setting. Not only it has a shallow mediocre material, but tells neutral status rather than

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266419">
        taking some components on every aspects that depicts on a massive downgrade fantasy series. Such as political struggling issues on the deaths between set of characters for having a severe breakdown.<br />
<br />
The writing in this book is decent for the most part. It struggles in the dialogue department at times, coming off as rather clunky in a few areas when it introduces a character and awkwardly explains what they’re about to characters who already know (see Suou’s introduction). Otherwise, I found the dialogue pretty decent enough. It presents us with a redeeming setting wrapped in a coat of luscious, beautiful artwork that is an eyed candy to our eyes, But It lacks a strong cast currently and its pace may be more of a hindrance than a benefit to some horrifying, but fascinating to look at and ponder. Not bogging you down in the detail and bringing them in one at a time. The pacing is quick and while I find that hurts the story, it can be a benefit for those who just want to get straight to the point. Plus, things are easy to follow and never feel that confusing even despite the characteristics, It felt cringe enough to width the amount of parts by being left in a mark.<br />
<br />
From the verge of the existence in between the stellar art and beauty<br />
intertwine a vision had caught in a blink state of morality. And was also left a complete anticlimatic attempt as it never reach to it&#039;s mere type of conclusion. Stereotypes are never felt biased and failed to deepen a crucial focus on what&#039;s life is normally like on the Mud Whale. This doesn’t necessarily hurt the series much, Neither pacing didn’t do its justice, by showing characters, or plot any favor. It probably would have been more essential where exploiting a desirous on began challenging the unbearable of living and anticipating the less aesthetic human nature.<br />
