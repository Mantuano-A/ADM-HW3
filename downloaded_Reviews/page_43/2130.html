    How often do you get a good night&#039;s sleep? <br />
<br />
I never get the sleep I deserve. After watching so many bad anime, I stay up all night tossing and turning in bed. A lack of sleep can cause depression, anxiety, weight gain, etc. No sleep medication has helped me. Melatonin, Benadryl, Trazadone, even horse-tranquilizers. Nothing worked... until now. I finally found the cure for insomnia, and its name is The Misfit of Demon King Academy. <br />
<br />
Hi, I&#039;m RebelPanda and I&#039;ve made it my job to ensure YOU get the good night&#039;s sleep you deserve. <br />
<br />
Just turn on an episode of The Misfit of Demon King

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357716">
        Academy and you&#039;ll feel drowsy in seconds! No anime has made me fall asleep faster since Kenja no Mago! It blends every generic power-fantasy anime trope into a single episode. Remarkable! There are no stakes, no one can die, there is infinite plot armor, and the visuals are fucking awful! Magic circles are thrown across the screen with photoshop, CGI fire is copy-pasted ontop of hideous background art, and all the character art is overexposed. The premise has been done hundreds of times, which is what makes it so effective. You&#039;ll never need to count sheep again after you watch this. <br />
<br />
The demon king Anos Voldigoad fought a 2,000-year war in a non-descript medieval world, but he became so bored that he let his archrival kill him! So relatable! Watching his backstory made me want to die of boredom too! 2,000 years later, Anos is reincarnated as a baby to marry a couple of 14-year-old girls. And they&#039;re also... his ancestors!? Don&#039;t bother calling the FBI, they&#039;ll just fall asleep too! He&#039;s perfect. So of course, he does not develop at all. Even though he murdered thousands of people, he never needs to reconcile that. Thankfully they didn&#039;t forget the most important trope; every woman irrationally loves him! I can&#039;t blame them. Who wouldn&#039;t love this man? He&#039;s so charismatic, rebellious, kind, confident, handsome, attractive—oh dear, look at me. I&#039;m in love with Anos too! <br />
<br />
You deserve a good night&#039;s sleep. For the small price of $79.99, you can sleep for 2,000 years, just like Anos! Reduce stress, improve concentration, and get an eternal slumber. Call 1-800-420-ANOS for your very own subscription! If you don&#039;t like it, which is impossible because Anos is perfect, we will give you your money back. Call now and we&#039;ll throw in the soundtrack (free stock music) for no extra charge! Side effects may include cringe, drowsiness, and in rare cases...<br />

As of September 26th, I have been watching The Misfit of Demon Academy for 13 weeks. Now I only watch one episode a week, but it has changed me irrevocably. This anime haunts my vision, night after night, all I see is Anos violently slaughtering his classmates with a heartbeat. With a flick of his finger or a heartbeat. They instantly explode in a burst of blood, then he reincarnates them. No one ever dies. There are no stakes. <br />
Everything that happens in the world gratifies him. Anos even has his own Fanclub of girls who pray to him like he&#039;s a God. Even though his harem of a dozen women has powers, they are useless compared to him. He ALWAYS saves them. Now I just need him to save me too. I can&#039;t get this shit out of my head. I can&#039;t get out of bed. I&#039;m dependent on this awful anime to function. I thought if I watched more it would make me stay awake. But the more I watch it, the more I wish I could fall asleep. <br />
<br />
People said this anime is satire because it cuts out all the typical power fantasy bullshit. It doesn&#039;t waste time pretending to be deeper than it is. Except, that isn&#039;t satire. It isn&#039;t subverting anything. It is all the same. The main character is overpowered, all of the girls love him, there&#039;s a tsundere, all of the villains are evil for the sake of it. I can&#039;t for the life of me understand how someone who disliked Kenja no Mago or Isekai wa Smartphone would like this. If you want pure power fantasy injected straight into your veins, watch this. You will love it. Anyone who watches this show with their brain turned on will realize it&#039;s fucking garbage. <br />
<br />
Once being reincarnated, Anos discovers that hybrid demons like him are an oppressed race. They are subservient to pureblood demons. Anos&#039; fan club/idol group sings a song to empower the hybrid race, to protest their oppressors. Except, the hybrids tell the purebloods to &quot;Know your place,&quot; which doesn&#039;t combat discrimination. It only replaces it with more racism. Good job! Anos Voldigoad ended racism with more racism! Anos tries to be funny, but all of his jokes fall flat. He always sounds bored and his face never changes. It&#039;s like he has a full-house, and he needs to make a poker face. Everyone loves him, he is endlessly powerful, and he slaughters foes with no effort. He pauses after a one-liner like he&#039;s waiting for the audience to applaud or laugh. Whoever wrote this light novel needs to not write comedy anymore. I&#039;m sorry your parents never said you&#039;re not funny. You unironically wrote a story that congratulates narcissism and racism. This is one of the most shallow, illogical, and condescending anime I&#039;ve ever watched. Now, where&#039;s my apology?<br />
<br />
The Misfit of Demon King Academy made me exhausted. My life has been ruined because I sleep so much. I&#039;ve tried to stop watching, but if I skip an episode, I can&#039;t fall asleep for the rest of the week. Attempting to stop watching it cold turkey caused me to feel extreme withdrawal. My heart races, my ears ring, I get constant migraines, and I violently vomit. I feel like worms are chewing through my mind. I cannot describe how much I hate this show. Don&#039;t make the same mistake I did. Watching The Misfit of Demon King Academy is so bad it will literally rot your brain.

    The Misfit of Demon King Academy is yet another seasonal dose of uninspiring wish fulfillment series that we get every single season, you should not be surprised, therefore, to learn that this is an adaptation of a light novel series. You know, what if there aren’t even actual writers behind these stories generic? What if there’s just a very clever ad lib program cranking these novels out? It’s full of modern tropes and an algorithm to arrange said tropes into all the derivative dreck we know and love. Why, all you’d really have to do is fill in the names!. <br />
<br />
Anyway, this is one of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357652">
        those shows where the main character is overpowered right from the very start. The name is Anos Voldigoad but why he so strong? Because apparently, he is the reincarnation of the infamous demon king from 2,000 years ago. So basically, we get to watch him steamroll over everyone without breaking a sweat. At one point, he kills a guy by snapping his fingers, he can pick up a castle with a single hand. He can challenge the god of time and the time itself, he has a fan club with members all girl without a single man. This dude is a harem king and so overpowered that Tatsuya a.k.a Onii-sama from Mahouka had to delay his anime because clearly, he got intimidated by this demon king.<br />
<br />
But to be fair, despite all the complaint above. This wasn’t exactly the worse thing ever. Maybe I’m just desensitized from all these years of watching anime, that I became more tolerable, it still featuring cringe worthy scene and the unnecessary fanservice that definitely distracting rather than compelling, but the fact the matter is I do not find this to be as terrible as most people would set, despite seen this sort of thing before. <br />
<br />
Moving on, as overpowered as Anos is, the real challenge isn’t on the battlefield. Rather, the real challenge is with his interpersonal relationships. Our protagonist is very dismayed to see that his own descendants have allowed the bonds between them to deteriorate and like almost every anime that has ever featured an academy, we have the same tired class conflict where the very school he attended has belittled him and deemed him as ‘misfit’. There’s also thing about the world peace between demon race and the ‘human hero’ that he failed to achieve and after 2,000 years the reality have faded overtime.<br />
<br />
Anos’s personality is shameless and confident guy with sense no fear whatsoever, well certainly it was a given since he’s the demon king. But this kind of fact only elevated by the level of voice acting which I personally liked. Anos is voiced by Suzuki Tatsuhisa, most well known by voicing Ban in Seven Deadly Sins, his performance in this series I feel is quite magnificent.<br />
<br />
For the secondary characters, it was good I guess that they are just not there as a background characters that their purpose is only became the cheerleaders while Anos ‘s doing his thing (well not at the battlefield, as they are practically useless). Each secondary characters here has their own episodes dedicating for their origins and troubles, making them becoming not so much bland characters you usually seen in this one man show series, from the main heroin twin Sasha and Mischa, to be typical best bro characters in Lay and some story with his love interest, even some characters like Anos parent added a bit of charm , it’s not much but at least there’s an effort that count for something. However, there’s also my main gripe in the way they handling the characters, in the sense all the secondary characters here are just another tsunderekko, and the whole point of tsundere is to tear down any strong-willed, independent character until they’re brought down below the level of the male protagonist.<br />
<br />
For the lowlight, I don’t really understand why everyone in this universe is so willfully blind. Anos is declared a misfit, because they think he’s the furthest thing possible from becoming the next Demon King. After all, it’s been 2,000 years, so the finer details are bound to have faded overtime. My point is that action obviously speaks louder than words. At first, you might think Anos is crazy, because he keeps shamelessly calling himself the Demon King. He must be deluded, one might assume. But after seeing all these crazy feats like, you know, picking up a castle why are there still doubters? Why would the instructors, people tasked with identifying true potential within their students, not recognize greatness before their very eyes? Not once has anyone ever said or even think “this guy might be legit.” So yeah, this part kind of pulls me out of the story.<br />
 <br />
For the visual it was disappointing. The characters design is so lacking and utterly forgettable, it just… there’s no spark; there no any feature in the characters that is atleast show their attributes. Most of the time if not all, the characters wearing the same clothes even though there are times when they do not have to. “Breathtaking” is the last word that coming out from your mouth when it comes to the setting because they look like every other generic medieval city in anime while fantasy in itself offer unlimited amount of imaginable world. Battle scene is absolutely pathetic as it was finished rather quickly due to Anos’s power and even when there’s a bit long fighting it wasn’t really exciting nor inspiring. <br />
<br />
Alright, let’s wrap this up. The plot are rather carbon copy and unexplored, the art is very uninspiring, the animation is somehow even worse, and we have apologists coming out of the woodwork to claim that this is supposed to be a parody of Overpowered protagonist stories. But even viewed as simply another mindless show , this show fails. It has little entertainment value whatsoever. The harem bits aren’t even worth mocking. The hero is overpowered, but somehow everyone is wilfully blind to his power. The world-building is poor. Voice acting was okay but that;s about it. Despite myself telling this is not the worse series I’ve seen, and even trying to find a positive in this review, this is still a bad anime that I would not lose any sleep if it never got a sequel.<br />

This show is absolute ass.<br />
<br />
The Misfit at Demon King Academy is the epitome of the average isekai/fantasy show we get every season. The definition of insanity is repeating the same dreadful mistakes but expecting change each time. Repetitiveness is a common theme in the Fantasy and Isekai genre. We see a handful of bad fantasy/isekai shows based off of light novels each year, but none can compare to this new horror-fantasy show: Misfit at Demon King Academy. The fact that this show gets away with pushing every fantasy stereotype but to the extreme and passes as a &#039;good&#039; show is the horror that surrounds Maou

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349913">
        Gakuin. <br />

This is the new Kenja No Mago (2019) but with a little more “edge”. I usually call anime by their Japanese titles especially when they have poorly translated English titles but this show was adapted from a light novel. You know an anime is based on a light novel when the title is at least two sentences. Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha: Shijou Saikyou no Maou no Shiso, Tensei shite Shiso n-tachi no Gakkou e or the Misfit at Demon King Academy isn’t so edgy I could cut myself running this show across my finger, but it definitely is trying to be just that.<br />
<br />
The story follows a very original and new concept to the anime world. The protagonist is overpowered, “cool” and a demon lord. I have never seen this ever in anime! Of course, this is sarcasm and hyperbole as I have probably seen this trope at least a hundred times. Oh? This time it is an “edgy” fantasy anime. Unlike dark fantasy anime, this show is shallow and tries to use blood and edge to show the viewers how different and unique it is. Using gore in fantasy is great when done right. However, Misfit at Demon King Academy suffers from being too average and predictable. It has been done well over a thousand times, from the plot to the tropes all the way to its characters, everything seems like it has already been done. All of the characters in this lovely fantasy world have those fake medieval fantasy language-type names. You know the ones where girls are named Siryvilia Freinsil-Timeswork. But these names are so random and lazy that they don’t even have elements of fantasy or magic. Something about them feels cheap and thought of on a whim, just like this anime. Names aside, everything in this anime is bland and so average from the plot to the characters and to the art style. The characters are bland and follow the same formula as characters from Kenja no Mago, another subpar bland fantasy.<br />
<br />
 This show is a cumstain of an isekai. This show feels like it is imitating Overlord but is too shitty to even be called a parody. We are constantly reminded that our main character is overpowered but forgiving and caring for his friends. He forgives evil nobles who have wronged his almighty plot armor towards the end of episode 1 and brings home the forgettable female love interest. In episode 2, it is shown that our sweet protagonist has a backstory. The backstory isn’t exciting. The anime explains that Anos was the almighty Demon Lord who made a deal with the Hero that humans and demons could seek peace. Instead of Anos being a stereotypical tyrant the creators of this show clearly want you to see him as a good guy. Episode 2 is similar to episode 1 in that there is another exam. The overpowered main character again shows off his demon lord powers. Except at the end of this episode instead of the protagonist, Anos, getting the first girl, he gets her sister to fall in love with him. You can tell from a mile away that the story was half-assed and lazily put together. This anime makes Sword Art Online look immaculate.

    At first i thought this will be shit but surprisingly it&#039;s fun watching this even though the plot is not very interesting (at least for me but i think it&#039;s worth a rating of at least 7). I gave it 10 though because of great animation/art. It&#039;s not your so called extraordinary anime so don&#039;t expect something like that from this. You can say it&#039;s just for fun. Because the story/plot is pretty much simple so you think  it might be boring but surprisingly it&#039;s fun watching it.<br />
    Some people who read manga are disappointed in it due to the skips

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349856">
        it took. But i haven&#039;t read manga and nor do i intend to because i am really enjoying this anime. The animation is superb(It&#039;s the main reason why i liked this anime so much). And the story so far is good as well. The MC is cool although he is overpowered but still he looks cool and has his own past. I think the story will develop more in future and MC will become more great. The two female characters are good as well (especially misha) and they has their own story which was shown in episode 3 and 4. No problems with sound as well. I am totally enjoying it. It&#039;s a fantasy(magic) type anime but still for some reason i found it refreshing. I don&#039;t find anything appalling/negative in the story and since art is great it makes this anime good. If you are the type of person who likes good animation than this is for you, give it a try. You will definitely not get bored. People are just rating it down because it skipped some parts from the manga(i know that&#039;s a big deal but still if you are enjoying it than forget about the manga). For now this is all i can say about this anime.<br />
<br />
Edit: Story isn&#039;t developing that greatly so -1 for now.<br />
Enjoy :)

    As many may suffer and will involuntarily cause self-harm while watching this trash. I have transcended and have fully embraced the mediocrity and found hilarity in this tragic show. I mean this is so shockingly bad I look forward every week to see how stinky this garage burns every week. <br />
<br />
The characters are like poorly programmed NPC in a generic arse fantasy game, which you would usually skip over the dialogue to get to the action. Sadly, the action is hilariously anti-climatic and borderline comedy. The motives of the MC, Anos, makes no sense to me and yet I can tell actually what he will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350101">
        say or do, i.e. I will do some crazy OP stuff because I can. But you know what. I admire how much of a dumpster-fire these characters are. Characters: 1 Pathetic.<br />
<br />
The story is terribly predictable and I don&#039;t think of myself as an attentive watcher of anime and can predict the future from paying attention to the colour of some obscure object in a scene as my high school literature teacher taught me. But thankfully I didn&#039;t need to use my brain that much here as I had to in class which was minuscule. Plot: 1 Pathetic.<br />
<br />
As I was reading what the community had to say about the Art and Animation, some stating that it was outstanding, it truly baffles me that anyone would think that its the standout element of the show. What tree branch were you smoking? I&#039;m guessing this is because there is nothing else good about this show I mean I guess your eyes have to be entertained by something. I&#039;ll admit the art is clean and consistent, it doesn&#039;t strike out as bad in any way but I&#039;m just amazed someone would dedicate this much animating budget to this hipping pile of trash. <br />
<br />
The animation is pretty decent but nothing to write home about, some fight scenes are noticeably short and pretty cheap, mainly to dedicate more time to the more important fights which in themselves are pretty average. One key component to good animation is the sense of weight, which when done well gives the illusion of power behind punches, which adds to the intensity of a fight. However, it appears to be non-existent in some scenes, e.g. the spinning castle which was a highlight funny moment, my eyes were balling. <br />
<br />
In short, the fights aren&#039;t intense in part due to the weak animation but also due to poor storytelling Animation/Art: 5.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have the energy to really comment about the sound because honestly... I couldn&#039;t hear it over how loud I was laughing and yelling. But seriously, the sound effects aren&#039;t unique and lacks personality, if my eyes were closed while watching this show I probably wouldn&#039;t be able to distinguish it from any other generic Isekai fantasy show out there. Sound: 5<br />
<br />
To really enjoy watching garbage burn without vomiting and turning away. One must learn to stop thinking and turn off one&#039;s brain for a moment of internal peace. Then you may enjoy this show for what it really is. Trash. And I like trash. Enjoyment: 10 Outstanding. <br />
<br />
Overall: 4, I understand that the maths doesn&#039;t add up but whatever this trash doesn&#039;t deserve anything above a 4.

    Well, I’ll be damned. In 2020, it seems overpowered fantasy tropes still finds its time to take up TV screen time. Because in this anime known as ‘The Misfit of Demon Academy’, main protagonist Anos Voldigoad adheres to everything you can describe about a character with too much power. And if you’re hoping to see a well-developed show with likable cast or creative story, then buckle your belts. Spoiler: you won’t.<br />
<br />
Adapted from the light novel of the same name, it doesn’t take long for the audience to discover why Anos exist in the present timeline. He has been reincarnated after 2000 years and is now

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357642">
        one of the most powerful beings on the planet. This isn’t just a legend but a fact as we’ll witness the extent of Anos’ abilities – magic, intelligence, experience, and overwhelming power. In a way, you could say he’s nearly damn untouchable. Or is he? Well, not every being is perfect but Anos has been labeled as a ‘misfit’ in his current timeline. That’s why he came to an academy and with a goal to once again become a Demon King.<br />
<br />
At this point, you’re probably already asking yourself why the author decided to create such a powerful protagonist. There’s much proof throughout the show how powerful Anos is when he overwhelms his enemies without batting an eye. One example includes him using a mere stick to fight against a sword while seemingly treating the fight as a game. To Anos, life feels like a game and he doesn’t take it much it seriously. The first few episodes shows that he’s enjoying his time and isn’t as malicious as his former title may imply. In fact, Anos seems to respect those who are loyal such as his female classmates and characters such as Sasha, who has a vast amount of magical potential. This brings the question...should we like Anos? The question seems ambiguous but also easy to answer. He’s a stereotypical character with little to null character development. And with just 13 episodes, you’re not going to unlock his potential because it’s already there. Let that decide how much you’ll care about the former demon lord.<br />
<br />
Sadly, most of the other cast doesn’t hold up much potential either. This is pretty much the Anos Voldigoad show. He runs it from morning to night and no one can really hold a candle to him. Sasha and Misha are two main characters that Anos believes may have a lot of potential. Sasha in particular is a prodigy with special eyes and talent in the magic arts. Of course, this is all impractical compared to Anos as evidenced in their first fight. While Sasha does stand above her classmates, she’s nothing but an ant in Anos’ world. Misha, the younger twin sister of Sasha, has powerful magical capacity. Anos even admits that someday, she may be able to surpass him in creative magic. The key word here is ‘someday’ because from the Misha we see in the anime story, she’s a fragile girl with few friends. As a matter of fact, Anos is one of the only few characters that looks her in the eye and treats her with kindness. Her relationship with Sasha gets a bit more complicated as the two rarely see eye to eye. Although their relationship improves later on, the storytelling side doesn’t fully explore their characters as a whole. Because let’s be honest here: This anime has and always will be about Anos Voldigoad.<br />
<br />
The main story itself continuously adapts Anos’ journey to regain his former glory but along the way, he also encounters formidable rivals. These include other students such as Lay or even Demon Emperors. Unfortunately, most of these characters remain underdeveloped and seemingly added to the show to push Anos. In every confrontation, it’s shown that Anos is the powerhouse. Furthermore, Anos’ fights in the show remains undeveloped due to the nature of his powers. Every fight feels repetitive with the overemphasis on magic. When these fights attempts to apply psychology, they fall short on feeling something unique. If I said it once, I’ve said it a hundred times. This show is really about Anos Voldigoad, the misfit of the demon academy.<br />
<br />
Silver Link’s experience in crafting this project to life can be best described as mediocre. Nothing in particular stands out above this light novel adaptation when compared to similar shows. The character outfits are designed with an academy vision in mind. To be honest, Anos, Misha, and Sasha are the only characters that stands out as the main cast. To further enhance their abilities, the anime designed them with aesthetic eyes that symbolizes their power. The world setting of the show lacks an attractive appeal because let’s face it, once you’ve seen an academy like this, you’ve seen them all.<br />
<br />
Upon finishing the show, I asked myself if this was the franchise’ attempt to get the audience to purchase the light novel. The impression this show gave makes it easy to recognize that it’s just a tease and viewers will need to spend more money to experience the entire collection. Is it worth to drop money into this franchise? Not a chance.

    The demon king sacrifices himself to allow for a better world to be formed. Eventually the time for him to reincarnate comes, and he finally sees the consequences of his choice.<br />
<br />
While we say reincarnate, it is more accurate to say he got a new body. In other words, he is as strong as he was in his previous life, with all the memories.<br />
 <br />
More importantly, when he comes back he decides to go to school and learn about this new world. Also, he wishes to reclaim his place as the demon king. Actually that&#039;s the real goal, the school is kinda needed for that.<br />
<br />
(Btw because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350028">
        this is an anime, he basically builds a harem along the way. )<br />
<br />
I think that&#039;s the best i can do without getting too spoliery.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, this show is average across the board. That doesn&#039;t make it not fun though. The thing has it&#039;s far share of memes after all. It also has it&#039;s part in this season&#039;s waifu wars. <br />
Not for having a good waifu, but a bad one. (I think that&#039;s the best way to put it.) For some reason this season people are picking out waifus with bad personalities or something. (None of this is important.)<br />
<br />
So far the waifus are his driving factor for actually doing stuff because he&#039;s the actual demon king. Getting good grades and performing is something he can do in his sleep.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for a simple show to burn time, give this one a shot. <br />
Actually i don&#039;t know how much this will be worth watching once the season is over because the community is making it alot more enjoyable.<br />
Watch it anyway.<br />

    Once upon a time, there was a man, who obliterated whole countries, burned the forest of spirits to ashes and even killed Gods as if it were nothing. The man was feared as the Demon Lord. However, even a Demon Lord gets tired of the horrors of wars and proposes the heroes, who come to negotiate with him, to kill him, split the world into four: the human world, the demon world, the spirits world, the world of the Gods, to build walls between the worlds, and to seal their gates for 1000 years. After 1000 years, the grudges between demons and humans should disappear.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357641">
        2000 years after the Demon King has finally been reborn, the new world truly shocks him. How has the world changed in 2000 years?<br />
<br />
Imagine the frustration of the strongest magical creature to find out that the world he is reborn in has very weak magic and the most important part in all of this is that his descendants are so weak that it is beyond pathetic.  But that does not worry the Demon King, since all he wanted was to stop the war. Anyways, Anos Voldigoad tries to research the new world and gets an invitation to the academy that should determine the Demon Lord. Anos is not the only one to get the invitation, there is a great number of promising students among those, who are expected to enroll this year; these promising students are also called the generation of chaos. Among them, a one month old kid, who has become a teenager in no time with the help of a magic spell, leaves his home and enrolls at the Demon King Academy together with that ‘problematic’ generation. <br />
<br />
That said, the storyline does not sound that bad. However, there is one problem for me to voice. It is beyond obvious. Anos is way too powerful, he meets enemies and there is no ‘will he win,’ it is only ‘how will he win?’ Which means that every single moment you are 100% sure that Anos will always win: be it a God, a demon, the strongest warrior; it does not matter, Anos always wins. This is what this anime is. <br />
<br />
Character wise, while they do seem to be a bit cliché, it is not as annoying as you might think. The Misfit of Demon King Academy: History&#039;s Strongest Demon King Reincarnates and Goes to School with His Descendants has decent characters that are somewhat interesting to follow. Too bad, after some episodes, you will hardly find anything unique and interesting about them; it is always a tsundere and an emotionless girl that wants to become something more than a puppet and it does not change even after the final episode. While I disrespect the ‘manga is better’ anime fans, this is exactly one of these cases, since the anime fails to show the characters in a good light for the viewer; it shows them mediocre at best, which is hardly enjoyable. <br />

Anyways, The Misfit of Demon King Academy is yet another example of a yet another bad anime adaptation. If you are a fan of overpowered Demon Lords, this anime is what you are looking for. However, if you think that there is an appealing storyline for you to follow and interesting and unique characters for you to enjoy, this might be the wrong choice for you to make. In the end, this choice is for you to make.

    This show is not for you if you&#039;re looking for a shounen show with an MC that the universe conveniently shelters from higher danger until they can power up or activate some hidden power they&#039;re born with that reveals itself when their life is in danger.<br />
<br />
Anos has figured everything out. He is at the peak, he is OP. He understands his magic and others&#039;. He knows himself and the enemy, he&#039;s in control.<br />
<br />
This show is not for you if you&#039;re looking for a unique twist with suspenseful power reveals or tactics.<br />
<br />
Anos can brute force his way out of any situation. Still, he promotes other people

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350661">
        to think outside the box since he knows there are many types of power, cleverness is one of them. He also pushes others to take on challenges to help them grow. He acknowledges peace creates weaker people, but loves peace since he understands the cost.<br />
<br />
<br />
Who is this show for then? Anybody who likes a mature MC with a level head who doesn&#039;t overreact or whine about every little thing because he&#039;s actually a respectable adult.<br />
<br />
Tired of MCs who can&#039;t control their emotions? Gets flustered from a little teasing like an 11 yr old? Is a slave to other people&#039;s opinions and loses their mind with the smallest amount of stress?<br />
<br />
Well, Anos is the rational man of choice for you. Absolutely stoic yet kind and not edgy. Loves his parents to death, can bring women to his home and treat them with respect without being awkward. A man who has resolved all his personal issues 2000 years ago and and has absolute control of his mind and heart. Now he tries to guide those under him who are stumbling their way through life.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for the same vibes as Overlord and One Punch Man, this is for you. Power is not the goal here, it&#039;s a tool (a really big one). Anos while pursuing a goal, considers it mainly a side quest. His main focus is to live a normal life where an era of war has not given him the luxury of.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s interesting all the way, the other characters are awesome. Yes they are tropey, but they&#039;re good tropey characters that assert their personality when the opportunity arises. They have their own desires and drive for doing what they do and don&#039;t feel awkward at all.<br />
<br />
The world&#039;s magic is coherent and the explanations are satisfactory, a world building that gradually shows you how things work instead of having you chew on one big info dump.<br />
<br />
The girls are great, the parents are amazing, but Anos really is the star of this show. We rarely get to see characters like him, an MC Marcus Aurelius and Seneca would be proud of.<br />
<br />
Themes:<br />
<br />
Discrimination due to heritage is a big one. Anos once again pushes progressiveness under the banner of &quot;Your worth should be from your own merit and labor, not something you are born with&quot;. He proves it with action time and time again.<br />
<br />
People will have their prejudice against you even if they see how capable you are because of some deep rooted &quot;racist&quot; beliefs. Anos&#039; good name is slandered by people who know nothing, but does he lose his mind? No, he completely understands where they&#039;re coming from so he continues on with his day.<br />
<br />
He wants to show other people his version of the truth, but does not obsess about it and simply lives in the present. Truly encompasses the &quot;it is what it is&quot; attitude.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve also caught up to the WN, and I&#039;ll share this one non-spoilery line of his which showcases his mindset:<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#039;m not bothered by misunderstandings. A misunderstanding won&#039;t become true no matter how long you wait. It&#039;s fine if the other person is wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re all about that line of thinking, give this show a shot. No pressure. If not, then that&#039;s fine, I hope you find a better show for you. And if you absolutely hate this show, that&#039;s fine as well. As for me, I&#039;m absolutely glad this show exists.

    Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha (The Misfit of Demon King Academy): THE SECOND COMING of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei (The Irregular of Magic High School)? I hope to believe so, because like the latter, to which the same ol&#039; gimmick of elitists proclaiming: &quot;Oh, ANOTHER &quot;power fantasy LN&quot; with the same OP MC likeness? Get the F*** outta here!&quot; is kinda tiresome at this point (and I honestly DON&#039;T F***ING CARE). But in actuality, this show is AMAZING and AWESOME AS HECK.<br />
<br />
Do you love power fantasy stories, with the lore of the actual MC not being a fuccboi and doesn&#039;t take a shit or 2 about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357645">
        others taking his place, all while being massively OP? Well then, like Mahouka&#039;s Tatsuya, Misfit&#039;s Anos Voldigoad will wreck you with his full-on &quot;lay dormant for 2000 years&quot; rightful Demon King powers so cold he&#039;ll knock you senseless to death, and then revive just to satisfy his desires of meting out rightful punishments to crush the morals of his enemies, NOW THAT&#039;S SATISIFYING.<br />
<br />
So the story goes like this:<br />
The usual demons vs. humans battle of wars and strife enraging for 2000 years, the TRUE Demon King Anos Voldigoad facing off against the typical Hero Kanon, in an unfathomable (but understandable) action of sacrifice to ensure the future peace between hybrid demons and ordinary humans (reincarnations of heroes, if you will). Fast forward 2000 years of another reincarnation, Anos finds that all is not what it seems: the codependency future of hybrid demons and humans living together, has taken for the worse with the typical class system that divides between royalty and commoners, not to mention that magic itself has weakened overtime, AND A FAKE Demon King shaping the post-history that completely wipes out his legacy of existence.<br />
<br />
In the seemingly new timeline of things, Anos must make right of A LOT of issues, starting with his enrollment into the Demon King Academy and make-do the class system of royal and lower-class hybrid demons, not forgetting the Hero side as well in a now 2,000 + 2,000 = 4,000 year-old never-ending implication and consequences of &quot;living lives for vengeance to revenge&quot; and the lore to &quot;put an end to something&quot;, ALL WHILE BEING A &quot;magic-illegible failure&quot; of a MISFIT.<br />
<br />
Onto the characters:<br />
OP MC Anos Voldigoad is one strong-willed, bad-ass man, and try to play funk with him, and you&#039;ll be severely awaiting death in the most insane of magnitudes. A strong-willed guy whose growth ascends fast from being a 1-month old infant, he is someone who walks the talk and honours his word from the moment of request, and honestly a hot figure to look out for. He is in every sense of the word: A CONFIDENCE MAN. No matter if he&#039;s looked down upon by everyone from the start, all he needs to do is prove through his magic of the sheer terror to shut his silencers up. Unlike the serious Takuya, Anos at least isn&#039;t serious the entire time, and knows how to crack a joke or 2 as ways to allay or make fear in the most unpredictable or comforting environments.<br />
<br />
Oh, and how can I forget Anos&#039; mother? She is easily the best supporting mum after Tohru&#039;s deceased mom (from Fruits Basket), legibly supporting their only child (with Dad) whose lives have been blessed since his birth, and what a close-knitted family who does not shake at Anos developing a harem and just plainly cooking dinner for more invited people. What a mother figure.<br />
<br />
Of course, what&#039;s a ridiculously OP MC without some women on the side?<br />
From the descendance of one of the Seven Elder Demon Emperors, Ivis, comes twin sisters: the Dandere Misha and the Himedere-cum-Tsundere &quot;Witch of Destruction&quot; Sasha, both of demon descent. The former likes to do things quietly, while the latter is a brash &quot;princess&quot;-like girl who wants the people to know how superior she is. The true purpose of the Necron sisters is to fuse into a single, powerful demon when they reach 15 years old, that somehow under Ivis&#039; direction to split Sasha&#039;s fetus into 2. Until then, the Hime-sama character will always continually shred Misha of her existence and not acknowledge her for life, that is until their 15th birthday where Sasha&#039;s true intentions are not to kill her, but to save her from calamity, from an alternate version of Anos&#039;s Demon King-like character called Avos Dilhevia. Personally, Misha is the sweetest of the 2, but give Sasha a break of time, and she&#039;ll reveal her tsundere side to Anos&#039;s appeal (but of course he&#039;d reject out of friendship rightaway).<br />
<br />
The challenged Royalty of a Demon-turned-ally, Lay Glanzudlii (or for better words, the manga adaptation of the LN-named Ray Grandsley). Like the other Royalty demons, he was once the opposing faction with the others, and taking up Anos&#039;s challenge to defy the odds of a commoner-turned-Royalty privilege, all while being at the behest control of the Royalty over his family (or rather, his mum&#039;s severe condition). Of course, we&#039;d expect Anos to save the day as usual and convert him into a useful ally. Along with Misa Ilioroagu, another classmate who&#039;s a Unitarian, not only does she acknowledge Anos as the TRUE Demon King, she is fighting to deride the class system as well with her full force, but clearly needing some help with. The loveline for both is quite small, but eventually the ship gets going (but I&#039;d wish it&#039;d be real).<br />
<br />
And speaking of Unitarian, The Unitarian Club, or more famously known as the AFC: Anos Fan Club. The entire group of bishounen-ish fetish girls for Anos. whom like Misa, also supports Anos as his rightful place of being the Demon King, and their support for the OP MC has been in every sense of the way, dangerously beautiful. I really like this twist of things that bring a fresh air into the power fantasy genre, adding the idol-like songs which emit a pinch of inspiration, not to mention the praises of the ONE AND ONLY TRUE Lord of their lives.<br />
<br />
Overall, the character cast of which I&#039;ve had immense terror and fun of watching for the past 13 episodes, and my excitement can only go the way up, not the way down.<br />
<br />
Silver Link has been on a winning streak for 2020 so far for Spring&#039;s BOFURI and Summer&#039;s Otome Game, both series earning a Season 2 after the end of their TV broadcasts, and to be honesty, it&#039;d be sad if this series didn&#039;t follow the past adaptations streak of getting a sequel. Regardless, it&#039;s rare for shows to have 3 directors, 3! Assistant director Minato Mirai (of BOFURI), Director Masafumi Tamura (of Kenja no Mago), and chief studio director Shin Oonuma, but to me it seems like Tamura-san had some involvement, and Oonuma-san being a direct influence in order to NOT turn this show into yet another Kenja no Mago. To that extent, I sincerely thank you Shin Oonuma for making the right decisions to make this show VERY enjoyable. The art style and animation can be said as a fusion between BOFURI (in the action) and Otome Game (in the character designs), and it&#039;s quite overwhelming for Silver Link to really go ALL OUT to deliver one of their best action-fantasy shows ever, but it delivers on ALL FRONTS. Great heck of a job done well.<br />
<br />
There might be nothing to sell on the sound department, but for what this show has to offer, it has also been pretty good. CIVILIAN&#039;s OP was the bog-standard fare of action, but how about adding Anos&#039;s VA Tatsuhisa Suzuki for a twist of fun? He did a remarkable job voicing Anos, yet to sing for the OP as well, what favor did the producers do to make him stand out even more. Tomori Kusunoki is back for another insane ED, and it&#039;s also another great song to add to the already impressive repertoire of an OST.<br />
<br />
All I can say about this show is: WOW...JUST WOW. BOFURI and Otome Game has exceeded my expectations for their respective genres, and Maou Gakuin is definitely THE addition to Silver Link&#039;s most ambitious show productions in just 2020 alone. To the elitists I say: SHUT YOUR TRAP and see this show for what is worth. The world may be unkind to the minority, but it&#039;s all A-OK to follow your own opinions.<br />
<br />
Just let the power fantasy rolls its flex.

    Do you like trashy fantasy shows with mediocre/poor plot, and cliche characters? I mean, I don&#039;t think anyone does but The God of High School is averaging an 8. So, why else would you watch this?<br />
<br />
Because you&#039;re bored, you want to turn off your brain and enjoy an arrogant prick of an OP MC go around and assert his dominance as the Demon King. I mean, when you can literally destroy your opponent with just your heartbeat, and taunt them about it, I&#039;d say he has cause for his arrogance. Once in a while, he&#039;ll throw out a joke and it&#039;s pretty amusing. <br />
<br />
The two

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350196">
        girls in the show so far are pretty generic trope character, one is a bit of a tsundere while the other is a kudere, also sisters (kind of?). There are backstories to them but they still feel one dimensional and just serve as fan service to our insert OP MC.<br />
<br />
The art and animation is nice, the music is nothing to write home about but it&#039;s not like a 12 year old with a bucket did it in their back yard either. <br />
<br />
There seems to be a plot, at least more so than something like the very similar The Irregular at Magic High School. But, this has about 100% less incest and 100% more flair, so it&#039;s a lot more enjoyable. Our Demon King is trying to find out who changed the past and more or less rewrote history, all the while showing off his overwhelming might to anyone who stands in his way. <br />
<br />
As of episode 4, the side characters introduced so far are relatively generic and boring, but the MC is different enough to keep you watching. There is some kind of plot going on so I&#039;m keeping my eye out on this to see where it develops. I don&#039;t have high hopes for this show but sometimes, you just want to turn off your brain and see some explosions or magical stuff. If that&#039;s not your cup of tea, skip this one.

    Do I recommend this anime to other people? Well yes but actually no.<br />
<br />
Imagine a mediocre generic fantasy/isekai anime with an extremely OP main character. Well, Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha is exactly that. Cute girls, annoying a-holes, random OP powers, lost magic, demon lords, different races, nobles, yea your generic fantasy anime.<br />
<br />
Story - 5/10<br />
Nothing new or unique. Seems like every other generic anime out there seems a lot like Kenji no mango. Obviously, the plot is kind of bland. I guess the demon lord coming back is kinda cool I guess? Well, overall the story is average. It&#039;s not a complete mess like other series so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349857">
        yea.<br />
<br />
Art - 7/10<br />
Do I want to rip my eye out because the art is so bad? No. Is the art so beautiful that it warms my heart? No. The art is average like the whole anime. Moving onto the animation style and quality. The animation style is bland... it&#039;s average. On the other hand, the animation is good it was pretty well done.<br />
<br />
Sound - 4/10<br />
I&#039;m not really a music or sound effect expert. I&#039;m just gonna say what I thought. The sound effect and stuff I can&#039;t really say much because I don&#039;t really pay attention to that stuff. All I can say is that the sound effect wasn&#039;t bad. On the other hand, the intro and ending songs were mediocre. I&#039;m not very picky when it comes to music unless it&#039;s really bad or when it&#039;s K-Pop. I guess I didn&#039;t really like the music.<br />
<br />
Character - 3/10<br />
It&#039;s average. Your average chill parents that love their children. An overpowered main character and cute girls fondling with him. And really shallow villains and dipshits that are too full of themselves.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 7/10<br />
I guess I like it (for now). It&#039;s not really that bad? Great way to waste your time when you have nothing else to watch. I actually enjoyed it more than I should have. <br />
<br />
Overall - 5/10<br />
It was really really mediocre and average.

    If I said I didn&#039;t enjoy the hell out of this series then I&#039;d be a liar. This is one of those anime where the main character cheeses the most absurdly impossible things in the most impossibly dumb ways. The story and characters aren&#039;t the best and it may seem generic at first but somehow it just got a hold of me and wouldn&#039;t let go.<br />
<br />
This was a 6/10 for me and deserves it fully, looking at it it&#039;s really good at being entertaining and that&#039;s all you should expect from a fantasy anime with a mc who can yeet castles like they&#039;re legos. <br />
<br />
I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357666">
        recommend this to anyone in need of watching an op main be op and all side characters being absolute potatoes cause they can&#039;t think for themselves. This is something you can turn on and turn off your brain to watch because there is no incredibly amazing, brilliant, or deep story to follow. There is a lot of symbolism and foreshadowing though, but everything was very predictable but that doesn&#039;t matter. It was a fun watch, and I don&#039;t care if it wasn&#039;t that good... It&#039;s a 6/10, nothing short of entertaining.

    So far this series has been pretty good. Normally I&#039;m not the sort for super OP characters. But this show does it right, it really does it right, with how our MC is, and here is why!<br />
<br />
Like I just mentioned, our MC is confident, arrogant, cocky, all of the above. I mean why wouldn&#039;t he? He&#039;s the damn demon lord, he can do what he wants. This is why I do feel the super OPness is done in a good way, but with the story it presents too, it makes it even more interesting, and it all fits well together.<br />
<br />
As for the other characters? You&#039;ll

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349843">
        learn to love those too! So far they&#039;ve brought out a wonderful cast of characters, from his parents, to two great in their own right sisters, and I cannot wait to learn more about them, and how they fit into the story. They each have their own personalities that really mesh well, and even sometimes amusing. <br />
<br />
The art style is good too, it&#039;s flashy when it wants to be, dark when it wants to be, in areas that really fit well with the atmosphere and theme of the current point of the episode. Much like the sound is too, really well done there.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m looking forward to more episodes as they come, and I&#039;m looking for to seeing how he goes around the demon school, and you should be watching too!

    Update 09/10/2020: Upon reaching episode 10, I stand by everything I&#039;ve said below. This series really doesn&#039;t deserve the hate it&#039;s been getting. Seriously, give it a try before you listen to all the negative reviewers!<br />
<br />
First off, I honestly don&#039;t know why I see a decent proportion of negative reviews. Yes, this is a typical yearly type of &quot;OP MC basic story&quot; anime, but you shouldn&#039;t blatantly review it based upon that. Watch it until the end of episode 3 to build a decent idea of the series.<br />
<br />
(9/10) STORY: So far, yes, the story is very similar to other types of anime. BUT, I think

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350525">
        it changes just enough to make things interesting. Demon Lord resurrects, but nobody recognizes his name. Well, why? For what reasons? You&#039;ll have to keep watching to find out.<br />
<br />
(8/10) ART: I don&#039;t often have an opinion on art, but this is very similar to Kenja No Mago, both in Character and Art. I think the art style is very well done, and that&#039;s all I have to say. It could be better I guess.<br />
<br />
(8/10) SOUND: Same as above, very similar to Kenja No Mago. I think the sound effects are very good and fit the series nicely. The sounds could be better.<br />
<br />
(10/10) CHARACTER: So far, with the exception of Momonga (Overlord) and Ichigo (Bleach), Anos has to be my top favorite character. He&#039;s suave, serious, takes no BS, has no fear in showing off, does not hesitate, and isn&#039;t a total wimp when it comes to girls. Anos is basically my perfect vision for how OP MC&#039;s should be. Other than that, there&#039;s other characters that have interesting backstories and techniques. It&#039;s mostly like any other anime though. Main guy has lover ladies, bla bla. Luckily this show doesn&#039;t seem to focus on the love aspect too much, but I&#039;m only 4 episodes in.<br />
<br />
(10/10) ENJOYMENT: Like I said, I freaking love Overpowered characters and anime like this. If you liked Overlord, you&#039;re gonna like this one too. I&#039;d suggest giving it a try until the end of episode 3. If you don&#039;t like it by then... I&#039;d be surprised.<br />
<br />
(10/10) OVERALL: This is easily going straight into my top 5&#039;s, and that&#039;s based on the first 3 episodes. I do seriously hope for a Season 2, but I know it&#039;s unlikely for these one-shooter series. This will be one that I come back to and re-watch many times a year.

    The Misfit of Demon King Academy is kind of like the Bible but someone else is pretending to be Jesus and the real Jesus gets harem members instead of disciples.<br />
<br />
Story: 2<br />
The story has a pretty simple premise: Demon king gets reincarnated 2000 years after his death, but everyone has forgotten about all the things he’s done and won’t believe that he’s the demon king despite how unbelievably powerful he is. One thing I liked was how each episode contained a small piece of the overarching story. This helped with both plot build up and world building. However, the smaller stories in each of the episodes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357663">
        got extremely repetitive. Every week, we got the same formula; Someone underestimates the overpowered MC, and the MC proves how powerful he is. In the big scheme of things, there were interesting battles, some plot twists, and even some hype moments that got me engaged, but I was not particularly amazed by any of this.<br />
<br />
Art: 5<br />
The animation was okay. At least it was consistent. The fight scenes were good and the CGI was decent.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
OP and ED were were great in my opinion. The sounds during battles like the swishing and clanging of swords were alright too. There weren’t any specific moments where I thought the background music felt out of place, but there also weren’t any moments where I thought the background music fit the scene super well. I usually rate high for sound when I feel like the soundtrack creates an impact and amplifies how much I enjoy a scene, but this was just average.<br />
<br />
Character: 2<br />
The character development was poorly done, and most antagonists were either brainwashed or elitist brats. Basically we have typical bland characters and an MC who is so overpowered that we don’t get any protagonist struggle. Seventy percent of the character interactions in this anime were just OP-kun beating a bunch of annoying amateurs at magical ability.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6<br />
It may not be good overall, but I actually kinda liked it. It was my guilty pleasure of the season. The story sucks but if you don’t think about all the little details, it’s actually decent enough for anyone to enjoy. I’d maybe recommend it to those who need a time waster.<br />
<br />
Overall: 3

    My ape brain can&#039;t comprehend how bad the ending was so I&#039;m just not gonna.<br />
<br />
Character: Generic isekai op protag bs. Imagine if my little pony had an OP protag with a Justice donger and the biggest Friendship and Love balls you can imagine and you get whatever this is <br />
<br />
Story: your usual isekai op protag stuff, after a week i probably wont even know what differs this one from the others <br />
<br />
Sound: It sounds like every isekai ever, you know, your usual psshew bang pow type effects<br />
<br />
Art. The CGI looks like some of the explosion greenscreen memes on youtube,<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: no. <br />

    The Misfit of Demon King Academy: History&#039;s Strongest Demon King Reincarnates and Goes to School with His Descendants wins the award for the most unnecessarily over the top title of the year. But then again, it fits perfectly with the actual content of the show itself, which can be described as nothing short of absolutely ridiculous. And that’s thanks to the inclusion of one particular being of immeasurable power and prestige. *drum roll*<br />
<br />
Anos Voldigoad<br />
<br />
That’s right, Anos deservers an entire line dedicated to his name alone, he’s just that omnipotent. This anime was literally a hair&#039;s breadth away from becoming a generic isekai. Which Maou Gakuin

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357648">
        technically is, since Anos gets reincarnated 2000 years in the future, so yeah, close enough! But the creator adapted the common trend of making an overpowered protagonist and took it to the next level and then some. Yes, Maou Gakuin does have other merits, but this approach really did wonders for this anime’s entertainment value. I mean it’s literally isekai One Punch Man but with waifus and far inferior production values.<br />
<br />
So unfortunately, the plot is pretty sloppy and heavily rushed in some instances. But instead of reading paragraphs worth of me boringly dissect the narrative, let’s just talk about the cool badass stuff! OH YEAH!<br />
<br />
Anos is a man who is one month old thanks to his EPIC aging abilities. Screw childhood, am I right!? He goes to a demon school that’s searching for the reincarnated demon king and proceeds to utterly beat the crap out of some punk kid who looked at him funny. He straight up murders this kid’s ass and revives him multiple times because death is an absolute joke to Anos. This was the first clue that Anos was going to be more than a typical Mary Sue, and he gets better from there.<br />
<br />
Throughout the story, Anos finds a harem befitting of his greatness. He acquires cute demon twins Misha and Sasha who fall for him and even kisses Sasha. Now that’s what I like to see! Not gonna lie, I actually liked the girls’ arc and thought that their bond was handled pretty well. And to top it all off, the climatic fight literally ends with Anos completely overruling the power of a frickin time god because time is an absolute joke to Anos. He then proceeds to beat the crap out of some demon lord dude. <br />
<br />
His harem grows when Anos is introduced to an actual Anos fan club of hot chicks. Now I absolutely loved their inclusion in the show. These girls literally get horny at the though of breathing the same air as Anos. The girls hilariously sing some coordinated chants for Anos when he fights, even during the frickin final boss of the show, and surprisingly have a touching moment when they defend Anos’ mom from a bitchy teacher. Anos beats the crap out of this teacher btw and proceeds to murder her ass and revive her as a pleb so she can understand the struggles of the common folk to TEACH her a lesson. What a flex! <br />
<br />
There are obviously far more badass Anos moments in the show, but you can just watch the anime to see them. If nothing else, the unique ways that Anos flexes on everyone definitely makes Maou Gakuin worth a watch. I mean at one point a guy literally jokes about Anos draining a lake and then Anos straight up evaporates the lake in like two seconds with a massive fire ball. It’s moments like these that I enjoy, and I appreciate the anime because of it. <br />
<br />
So I’ve basically just talked about Anos, but like I said, this anime does do a solid job with other characters. There’s this chill dude named Lay who plays an important roll and even a girl who falls in love with him instead of Anos. Yeah, that’s the biggest plot twist by far. Anos’ parents are pretty entertaining and each have some heartfelt bonding moments with Anos, which was nice. And even after their arc is completed, Sasha and Misha still develop and have some nice little moments with Anos that showcase their strengths, interests, and desire to grow. Wow, they’re actually more than just waifu bait!…Ok, they’re still waifu bait nonetheless, but at least they have some quality! Each character in the show from Anos all the way down to his fan club were given the spotlight at some point, and I was impressed with how Maou Gakuin tried to care about its entire cast. <br />
<br />
Instead of acting like a dull isekai protagonist and boring me out of my mind, Anos was something more. This made the anime quite refreshing. And on top of it having some surprisingly well written and fun character interactions, it actually ended up being a, dare a say, decent show in my mind. The critical part of me definitely wants to score the anime lower because of it’s flaws in several areas such as the plot and animation, but screw it. Anos is just so creatively badass that he beats the crap out of my logic and reason and makes me more generous in my reviewing. What a guy!

    From the first episode of anime, I can say that it is simply amazing. Anime is holding to his manga version hand to hand. I was very excited when I read the first chapter of the manga in 2018. And now we finally have an anime adaptation.<br />
For all that is reading this review, I can highly recommend the manga version you will enjoy it as same as anime.<br />
Character 8/10<br />
   The big thing for me was seeing my favourite characters for the first time. The <br />
        main thing was that they look older than in the manga

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349987">
        and are less 	 <br />
        characteristic. They are missing a lot of potential from the manga. But <br />
        Japanese voice actors made a good job. And especially I love the selection for <br />
        every character.<br />
<br />
Overall score: 9/10<br />
<br />
End word: Go watch it if you love the manga version, you won&#039;t be disappointed even tho manga is funnier.

    This anime suffers from generic demon lord self insert wish fulfilment who&#039;s somehow playing on god mode from GTA5. The fact that MB is not recommending you to watch this means this is an instant WIN! <br />
<br />
Story: The only thing carrying this anime is seemingly the &quot;whodunnit&quot; plot-line/ mystery thread which the answer to is 100% totally inconspicuous and cannot be seen from a mile away, I am actually intrigued to what happens to the MC, the only letdown was the out of place plot twist with absolutely no build up or catharsis of Episode 4, which is where many individuals have probably dropped this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353529">
        series from this point forward.<br />
<br />
Art: The artstyle is actually nice to look at and isn&#039;t an eyesore, maybe thats due to budget.<br />
<br />
Character: As stated above, the MC is a demonlord self insert and gets all the demongirls.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Aside from Girls Und Panzer-esqued mock battles except its demon magic, and tournament arc later in the series, this anime&#039;s is a guilty pleasure.<br />
<br />
Overall: Oh, did you really think I was going to give sarcastic negative rating? <br />
Foolish of you to believe so, I give this anime a 10/10. Greatest OP Demonlord ever made.<br />
