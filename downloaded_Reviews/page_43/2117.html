    Sex, lewd thoughts, and imaginations. Here&#039;s an interesting little trivia: Did you know that the average man in our world today think about sex nearly every 56 seconds? Fact or fiction, you decide. Of course, this is all normal. I mean, our minds is filled with all sorts of imaginations and dreams whether it&#039;d be finding the perfect girlfriend or going on your first dream date. In this anime known as the High School DxD, our protagonist Hyudo Iseei goes from a lecherous second-year high school student attending Kuoh Academy to someone he hasn&#039;t began to imagine before.<br />
<br />
At first glance, the title High School DxD

          <span style="display: none;" id="review61355">
        doesn&#039;t really stand out much. The first two words “high school” is probably a place most of us made good (or bad memories) in our lives. Of course, Issei hopes to make good memories because the school has recently turned into co-ed from a former girls-only school. And where else would a healthy boy at his puberty stage wants to make most of it? High school of course. But not all is easy as he is known to be creepy at the academy. With few “real” friends, the chances of making his goal of high school memories is becoming slim.<br />
<br />
That of course later changes when the unthinkable happens and he is killed by his very first girlfriend. Talk about bad luck, I can only think of one person off my head right now with the Imagine Breaker with that sort of luck. But is this really bad luck? Because the most beautiful and respected character of the school and series takes attention of him...<br />
<br />
First, we have the beautiful Rias Gremory. She is someone everyone admires and lusts about. She is the president of the Occult Club. And she is of course, the main heroine as well as one of the reasons some of us are watching this series for the lulz. She takes a curious interest in our protagonist Issei after the incident but what really makes her unique is her definite character. Behind her outer shell is a girl who takes responsibility and does what she does best: helping others. These traits seem to pass onto Issei for despite his creepiness around the academy, he is known to be helpful and hardworking.<br />
<br />
Then, we have some of the other characters. The sadistic Akeno who is also admired among the academy. Playful and flirtatious, she plays the role of the one-sama whom a lot of us wants to be “treated” by her. Then, we have our mascot, the all adorable loli Koneko-chan. Behind that cute loli apperance lies a girl of power and valor who puts her own life at risk to help others. Next, we have Asia-san, the pure girl that reflects the innocence of the series after all the lewd story arcs and peerage. Finally, we have Kiba who serves as the antithesis of Issei, whom he despises to no end. And of course, all these characters of the Occult Club are the bridge to Issei&#039;s path of becoming someone who he never thought he&#039;d be.<br />
<br />
By this point, some of you reading this review are probably thinking “god damn it, not another harem” or “fan-service...what else is new?” And of course, I agree there. Fan-service is nothing new but a device used to attract viewers. So, if you can&#039;t take the boobs, ass, and nudity, then feel free to watch another series. If you have a serious issue with the uncensored scenes and fan-service, then just drop the damn series as no one is forcing you to watch. However, if you can take it like a true anime fan, then kudos to you as you will be proud once you complete perhaps the ecchiest (if that&#039;s even a word) series of this year 2012.<br />
<br />
The art of this series is just meh for me. I didn&#039;t take much notice of it as most people are probably paying attention more to the action and fan-service than art when watching this. I don&#039;t blame you, I mean who could take their eyes off one second of that million dollar body of Rias Gremory? :) Then, of course, the sound. I do admit that it does mixes in well especially in later episodes where the seriousness conveys the more dramatic visage of the story. It&#039;s not as powerful as Yuki Kajiura&#039;s soundtracks from Mai-Hime or Tsubusa Chronicles but still all in all, it does fit well once you listen to it carefully.<br />
<br />
Despite being labelled as a ecchi and even harem on MAL, this series does have a storyline. Yes, can you believe it? An actual ecchi anime with a decent storyline! As such in series like this, you can expect the master and slave relationship. One catch though. This time, the girl is the master. Some of the viewers watching this may now think about the typical “master/slave” fantasies or “king&#039;s game” from your heads now. However, behind the scenes of the fan-service and nudity lies a story where a young boy goes from zero to hero. The storyline gets deeper in the light novels but the anime isn&#039;t all too shabby. It starts off as a predictable opening, goes to a more emotional setting, and then goes out with a bang. A literal bang thanks to what Issei learns and became throughout the series.<br />
<br />
So, you&#039;re probably asking yourself now: “should I watch this?” Honestly, that&#039;s an ambigious question. When God gave us brains, we all have different views on everything like anime, manga, life, appearances, etc. However, if you just watched the trailer or first 5 mins of the series and decided to hit that drop button, then I feel really sorry for you. Why? Because this series is more than just about ecchi and fan-service. It has potential. It has emotion. It has drama. It has interest.<br />
<br />
If you have serious problems with watching this anime, then maybe think about your High School memories. I bet Issei&#039;s virginity that the memories of your High School years won&#039;t be that much better than this series. (well, at least for me)

    Surprisingly, despite this being labeled as &quot;harem,&quot; this show didn&#039;t feel much like harem to me. Really strange. In fact, Sword Art Online felt even more of a harem than this, but ok. Issei only had like one real love interest, and that was Rias. Maybe it&#039;s the perspective of socially awkward people who think that if a girl talks to a guy, that means that the girl is in love with the guy that makes them think this is a harem. So I guess harem now means having a bunch of female characters and having one relevant male character in a same show. Oh,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125261">
        and I guess the main character constantly went on about how he likes harem or something. But I&#039;m pretty sure that doesn&#039;t qualify a show as harem either.<br />
<br />
Obviously one of the most important factors in these shows is the main protagonist. Everything centers around them, after all. Harem genre in general, unfortunately, does not have much variety in what main characters they could have. Very rarely you have protagonists like Keima, who is on a class of his own, or Shidou, who&#039;s at least likeable despite being incredibly generic just because he&#039;s not an annoying piece of shit that causes more problems for himself than everything else in the show. And then you have Issei. This protagonist just happens to be one of the obnoxious protagonists you could have in a show, harem or not. Did you ever watch other shows and saw that silly &quot;perverted guy&quot; who always hangs out near the main character and only exists as a brief comic relief? Yeah, that guy is a main protagonist now. Hope you liked those brief comic reliefs, because that&#039;s definitely not going to get old after an entire series. <br />
<br />
If that wasn&#039;t bad enough, he&#039;s also &quot;that&quot; guy who happens to have one of the most powerful McGuffins in the series, which makes him suddenly important. Normally this wouldn&#039;t be too offensive since it&#039;s done by literally every other show, where the protagonist happens to have that special trait that gives him unfair advantage no matter what, but the way this show handles it is just terrible. <br />
<br />
You see, the side characters that Rias has under her are supposed to represent what Issei lacks- Outside of them being awfully shallow as characters and merely existing to pander to specific parts of the audience as overdone archetypical tools that are in nearly any JRPG ever, they are supposed to exist to make Issei feel comparatively inferior. In fact, in the last episode, Issei talks about how he lacks the strength, healing ability, magical ability, or swordfighting skills while fighting the obligatory final boss of the season- Does this all matter? No. He has the most powerful weapon shown in the series so far, so why is this relevant? What was the point of making him seem &quot;inferior&quot; to others when all he has to do is do the typical resolve speech and it will make him just instantly more powerful than everyone else? <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s put that in this context and see if that sounds any less ridiculous:<br />
&quot;I may not have a bamboo stick, boxing gloves, or a first-aid kit, but I have a rifle that I can shoot you with.&quot;<br />
<br />
No, it still sounds dumb as shit. I also liked that chess analogy that the show kept bringing it up, though. It&#039;s almost like it&#039;s just there for the sake of being pretentious. And it is. <br />
<br />
As for Rias, she&#039;s just bland as any other character in this show. She even goes on a speech about how she wants to be seen as Rias/herself and not be carried by her family name and nobility- Huh, that sounds awfully familiar. Oh, that&#039;s right- That&#039;s every Disney princess speech about how they&#039;re so perfect that it&#039;s bad. Outside of that, she falls in love with Issei because he&#039;s the main character and also because her fiancee conveniently happens to be a pretty huge dick like again, every Disney princess plot. While I&#039;m not looking for super originality here, it&#039;s pretty bad if you&#039;re ripping off the fucking Disney routine.<br />
<br />
Of course, it doesn&#039;t help considering the second half of the show involves this Disney princess routine being played out for too many episodes while the first half involves this clearly not evil girl suddenly calling Issei out on a date only to show her true evil nature in the same episode. The asinine pacing can be further shown by how Issei goes on later about how he truly cared about this girl he met for less than a day and how he&#039;s sad to realize that she was evil all along. Am I supposed to feel sad here? Later, Issei meets this other random girl, who he also met for less than a day, and later on she gets captured by the aforementioned evil girl, and then she experiences a horrible Disney death on a techno-cross. Good thing Rias can resurrect dead people, so that didn&#039;t matter in the end. The great part is that there was supposed to be this time limit about saving her before it was too late, but that turned out to be totally irrelevant too. Way to build tension and break it in the same episode. Trivialize an already inconsequential death of a girl that the MC has met for less than a day is truly the best way to invoke emotions.<br />
<br />
As for the other elements of the show, the music is pretty generic, but not painful to listen to. The animation is also incredibly average, which is about what you&#039;d expect from a show of this genre. Though if I had to point out a flaw, it would be that the character designs were just really generic. If you can&#039;t give your characters any depth, at least make them look interesting. <br />
<br />
Overall, the show is bad. Shallow characters, annoying main character, irrelevant consequences (including how the MC &quot;sacrificed&quot; his arm for a power up, which was completely inconsequential), lack of an actual antagonist with an actual motive, and just overall being boring. It&#039;s downright offensive. The pacing was all over the place, and including quarter of the show with fillers is probably the most retarded idea one could come up with. <br />
<br />
Frankly, for the longest time, I&#039;ve been wondering why these harem shows were mostly awful. Maybe it&#039;s the overwhelming amount of pandering shoved into my face that is causing me to not enjoy these shows very much. Maybe. But more than likely it&#039;s just because they&#039;re fucking terrible. I tried to watch this all the way through while ignoring all the pandering so that maybe I could appreciate the hidden depth within. Or the lack thereof. <br />
<br />
It didn&#039;t turn out well after all. Let&#039;s not try that again. And neither should you.<br />
<br />
<br />

    High School DxD is an anime that has been praised as the best ecchi ever made, and in a way that is accurate. Seriously though, it is an ecchi. For all of you ecchi haters, stay away. Shove down your masochistic tendencies and walk away, this is not an anime you are going to enjoy. <br />
We all know what we are getting into when we turn this show on, copious amounts of T&amp;A. High School DxD has quickly become synonymous with that phrase. But even then, that was not the sole reason I turned this show on. I generally am the type that needs a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184623">
        bit more than titillating imagery to watch something. So when I heard that DxD also had this really cool story to accompany it, I was sold. Allow me to inform you that I can in good conscience say I feel betrayed...<br />
<br />
Story: 4<br />
*SIGH* <br />
Before going into the specifics of the story that follows the characters, let me say that the overall concept of this world is what truly piqued my interest in the show. A three way war between Devils, Angels, and Fallen Angels. An expansive world with history behind it. Varying degrees of mythology from different countries. Sadly, these aspects are quickly overshadowed by the story surrounding the main character. <br />
High School setting? Expected. It&#039;s in the bloody title. But what I wasn&#039;t expecting was a poor story about a servant and his literal power-ups. The story wants to be serious, but fails miserably at it. The so called &quot;emotional&quot; moments had me rolling my eyes, and the dialogue left me stunned from how many cliche Shounen lines it had. <br />
I am attempting to avoid spoilers, which is why I am avoiding the specifics that made this story as bad as it was. Just know this, it is a cool concept that loses points due to the execution. <br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
It was good and filled to the brim with boobs and panty-shots. I don&#039;t know what else I can really say. It was nothing spectacular, but is by no means un-watchable. Standard fare for when it was released. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
The OST was pretty solid. The music did a surprisingly good job of adding to the scenes. <br />
The standout aspect of the sound for me was actually the voice acting. I watched the show dubbed, but I have seen enough of the subbed to know that both are good. But in my opinion, watch the show dubbed. The voices may actually be more fitting in the subbed, personal preference really. But the dub has dialogue that adds to the hilarity of the scenes exponentially. When the MC can &quot;promise not to drain his pimp-juice&quot;, it&#039;s a damn fine dub.<br />
<br />
Character: 5<br />
Issei- An extremely typical pervert. I really, really disliked Issei. He is literally an idiot, and every single one of his thoughts revolves around something lewd. Of course he is also a decent guy with a heart of gold, but hey, that&#039;s just par for the course. He is established early on as a good hearted pervert, and he remains a good hearted pervert until the end. He does gain a bit of development, but it really is just a bit. <br />
<br />
Rias Gremory- Here we have the gorgeous, devil senpai you read about in the description. A surprisingly decent character. She is strong willed, honest, and oddly compassionate. Peculiar for a devil, but this show does break the occasional trope. What I liked about her character was how she took everything for what it was. Fully acknowledging and accepting Issei&#039;s perversion, and using it as a motivation. She doesn&#039;t care what other people think, and does as she wishes. <br />
<br />
Asia- Rarely have I found a more stereotypical &quot;nice girl&quot;. She is incredibly sweet to everyone, a bit naive and innocent, and completely incapable of defending herself. Did I mention she&#039;s a nun that falls for the main character instantly. I didn&#039;t dislike Asia, but I found it hard to like her as she hardly felt like a character. She was immediately filed into my brain as a ball of cliches, and I felt nothing for her because of that. <br />
<br />
The notable side characters are Akeno, Kiba, and Koneko. The busty sadist with a kind exterior, the respectful pretty boy, and the expressionless loli with a love for sweets, respectively. I was a big fan of these characters, and really wanted to see more of them. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5 <br />
There are a few things to enjoy about this anime, maybe you enjoy the comedy, the action, or the titillating imagery. For me, the comedy was hit or miss. Some jokes I loved, others I hated. The ones I hated usually pertained to Issei&#039;s perversion, it is such an overused concept that I don&#039;t even crack a smile. The comedy I loved was mostly in regards to the dialogue, definitely my favorite part. <br />
I really liked the action. Especially in the later episodes, I felt genuinely invested in what was happening. The action was accompanied by serious tones without being emotional tones, and they were pretty well done. <br />
The massive amounts of fan-service in this show really didn&#039;t do much on the enjoyment factor either. It doesn&#039;t lose any points, but boobs and panty-shots alone don&#039;t do anything. I suppose if you pause during one of Issei&#039;s fantasies you could pitch a tent, but it didn&#039;t do much. <br />
<br />
Overall: 5<br />
By that score alone, you may think it isn&#039;t worth watching. A passable story with some decent characters and good dialogue, seems like it isn&#039;t worth your time. But for all of you ecchi fans, and for those who can at least tolerate ecchi, this is worth watching. Why? Because it gets better. The first season of High School DxD really isn&#039;t that good, but the second season is good, and you can expect it to improve from there. Being knowledgeable about the original source material, many of the flaws in this anime will be fixed. The story will improve, characters will develop, it will become a good fantasy story. <br />
One aspect of High School DxD that I applaud the creator for is his honesty in regards to fan-service. He makes the fan-service a plot point by truly involving it in the MC&#039;s drives (and later abilities). He gives the fan-service a plausible reason for existing considering the amoral nature of the devils. The author embraces fan-service, which is a unique aspect I award credit for. <br />
<br />
High School DxD is an ecchi that develops into a good story. Anyone who tries to pass this first season off as the best ecchi ever is just lying to you. But it is worth watching just to see what comes later.

    High School DxD is based on the light novels written by Ichiei Ishibumi and illustrated by Miyama-Zero. It stands out from the other ecchi harems that I have seen in sense that the first season cannot really be considered a harem but rather Issei going after the female love interest Rias Gremory. Some of the other female characters do show interest such as Asia when Issei becomes more intimate with the other girls. But the real harem aspects of High School DxD show up in the second season. If you are a fan of the ecchi genre you will be pleased to hear that DxD

          <span style="display: none;" id="review155759">
        has plenty of perverted panty shots and uncensored boobs. I went into it not knowing what to expect, and surprisingly it has exceeded the relatively low expectations I had for it. <br />
<br />
High School DxD falls into the &quot;it&#039;s good for what it is&quot; category and does not try to be something it is not. This is why it should be viewed as first and foremost a fan service show. With some laugh out loud moments, senseless antics and occasional dramatic tones in the overarching plot. This is what makes it stand out from most other ecchi’s that resort to covering an unintelligible story with lots of fan service. High School DxD has an actual story and distinctive character development. With the fan service aside the show actually does have its merits. I particularly like the art style, decent visuals, and the music score.  <br />
<br />
High School DxD gives you a lot of variety in the female characters as well as the situations they get undressed. The girls of the Occult Research Club range from Koneko, a very petite and small breasted girl who displays a lack of emotion and seems rather unaffected by everything. To Akeno who is busty and seems to take some enjoyment from Issei’s antics. As well as the voluptuous Rias with Asia more on the petite side. All of the female characters are sexy and attractive in different ways. <br />
<br />
High School DxD is all about mindless fun with a respectable amount of T&amp;A. Evaluate it as a fan service focused series; it delivers on what it is, an ecchi harem comedy with an angels versus devils versus fallen angles aspect (This can get pretty confusing and doesn&#039;t make sense at times). It is a little better than average and one of the top recent series in its genre. Don’t go into watching this with the wrong mentality expecting it to be something it is not. You will be disappointed, watch it for what it is and you may find enough enjoyment to keep watching. I would recommend it to anyone new to ecchi and if this sounds interesting to anyone they should definitely check it out.  <br />
Overall=7          <br />

    In search of an enjoyable anime featuring hot girls, demons, a cleaver plot and tons of comedy? Search no further: this is the anime for you!<br />
<br />
Possibly the best anime of the season with the best girl: Rias. <br />
<br />
Issei is a total badass and should never be underestimated. His perverted attitude is but a shell to his inner kind side. Issei is a guy that never will let any girl cry and punish those who take advantage of him or his harem. A total bro.<br />
<br />
A must watch for 2012.<br />
<br />
The opening and ending are very good and catchy. Hypnobut. <br />
<br />
10/10 so you will watch it.

    Being a massive fan of the DxD series, I absolutely loved the anime adaptation. Anyone who has read the light novels would realise just how much emotional depth all the characters go through, especially Issei (the main protagonist) who I can only say had a VERY traumatic first girlfriend experience. High School DxD has a new take to a harem story, the author guaranteed a happy ending for all the girls and the plot is getting results that show it unlike other harem stories which can just end up a pain in the neck as the main protagonist is unable to choose.<br />
<br />
First of all, you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review72093">
        can immediately see the amazing art of the anime which can live up / match on par to the beautiful character designs that Miyama-Zero created. This of course closely ties into the effects used in the animation which were pretty much spot on to how i imagined them to be, especially in the battle scenes.<br />
<br />
You hear a lot of people complain about this series being &quot;too ecchi&quot; and put you off from watching but you&#039;ll just be missing out. This series was made with ecchi in mind but not to the degree of other series such as To Love Ru or Sekirei; they&#039;re pretty much several times worse in terms of ecchi level. However, I will say that the anime did add more fanservice and nude scenes than the original novel which many may think as a way to get views and sales. I myself am glad they did, not because there&#039;s more ecchi scenes to see but because it increases the chances of another season. The reason why im hoping for more of the anime is because the best parts of the story are towards to latter half of the light novel volumes and I would like to see it animated. The extra fanservice was doen in good taste and suited the pace of the story so it can be overlooked.<br />
This might be seen as hateful to do but the fact is that it wasnt done in a hateful manner; they didnt censor the all the scenes like the Majikoi anime where it pretty much forces you to buy the uncensored DVD / Blu-Ray releases.<br />
<br />
For anyone who thinks that there is little character development, I can now inform you that a second season is going into production and I guarantee that you wont be disappointed with the new characters that are going to appear. Every character has a part of themselves that is kept hidden past but the troubles are overcome through the friendship and relationship amongst the group. <br />
*Small spoiler* For the more battle loving fans, Issei&#039;s predetermined external rival will arrive soon<br />
<br />
Although there were some unnecessary parts included to buff out the anime, namely by including some of the short stories, the anime remained rather faithful towards the original story. In reality, it would have been better if they spent more time on the main plot to include more details and make the short stories into OVAs. <br />
Of course, they didnt miss out some infamous lines where the most memorable one appears in episode 12 of the anime. It would have been preposterous for them to have missed out that one.<br />
<br />
I know that this review may have strayed from just talking about this season of this anime and I apologise for that however, I needed to bring in other factors in hope that all you out there give this a shot and persuade you to watch it as the foundation to the greatness that is to follow. Reviewing DxD in such constricted context does not bring it justice. <br />
<br />
On a final note, don&#039;t watch this with females unless you know they&#039;re alright with an ecchi series...They&#039;re only going to get jealous with the beautiful female characters

    Seeing as there are no reviews up for this yet I figured I&#039;d pop out a quick review of my thoughts from episode #1 *UPDATED FOR EP #3*<br />
<br />
Summation: 7.5/10, story 7, Art 7, Sound 8, Char 7, Enjoy 9<br />
if you are looking for something on Friday nights, and/or if you want something light amusing and sexual, and don&#039;t already have one lined up for this season, I&#039;d strongly recommend watching at least the first episode to see if its for you.<br />
<br />
Review:<br />
<br />
UPDATED: While there exists in the show the normal stereotypes for females in this type of anime (The sadist, The shell/doll, The innocent) and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review51147">
        main character (at least to me) seems a bit flat, The other male lead, the interesting side characters, and the main girl actually being the best girl (inb4: your opinons =/= &gt; my opinions) keeps characters solid even if it fails to break any paradigm. Character - 7<br />
<br />
UPDATED: The plot of the show has progressed in such a manner that there are now a more clear idea of a general enemy(s) and task(s) that the Gremory Clan must vanquish/complete. The plot in itself has actually surprised me, in a good way, from what I would expect from this sub-genre. overall its done enough to pull itself clear from medicore to above average. - 7~7.5<br />
<br />
The combination of classical and more modern music sets a nice, and appropriate, background theme for the series. The voice actors/actresses, for the most part, seem to fit the roles well. **Although I&#039;m not a huge fan of the OP the ED is rather enjoyable - 8<br />
<br />
While the art, while nothing spectacular, did manage to get in a few nice transformation sequences, and it appears that they budgeted appropriately for the action sequences, something That I was rather happy and surprised to see after last season Itsuka Tenma.  - 7 (down from 8 due to some lesser quality sequences, although with BDs it could go as high as 9)<br />
<br />
Overall the show is worth a watch, especially with so little on the table this season. While not fantastic in any one department it does its job well enough that, at least for me, I was entertained throughout. Overall - 7 /10<br />
<br />
UPDATE: I&#039;m very on the fence about this score now to me the show has managed to prove that it can seperate itself from the pack, But I don&#039;t quite feel it deserves an 8 yet, as such my overall grade is a 7.5/10<br />
<br />
next update to come when the series ends, pending anything GLORIOUS or horrendous.

    Oppai, man we aaaall love oppai, they&#039;re round, good lookin, have a nipple in the middle. Man, but what about big oppai? Maybe oppai every single episode? Welp you got it! And thats Highschool DxD for ya, oppai or in english term, tits,boobs,melons,bozangas,milk-makers, I COULD GO ON ALL DAY. This show is a pretty weird example of fanservice, you got it everywhere! Hell some episodes nearly feel like filler episodes till the end of the episodes that continue the story. I came out of this show with no pants and a wet dick, but for now lets get to the review. Shall we?<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
So we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171641">
        start off with Issei, a typical pervert who peeks on girls with his pals at high-school. One day he meets this girl and goes out on a date with her, and well Issei gets killed by this bi- I mean girl and she turns out to be a, &quot;fallen angel&quot; DUN DUN DUUUUUN! So in Issei&#039;s final seconds he thinks about a girl called Rias who he saw earlier ago, and he ends up summoning her cause she&#039;s a demon! DUN DUUUUUUUUN. And this is where our adventure begins. This story goes on till episode 6 with filler, fanservice and the plot is kind of messy at times and hell at times I was wondering, &quot;Am I watching anime, or softcore hentai?&quot; Theres many oppais and a lot of shit going on, you just get confused. One moment Issei progesses the story by learning something another second he&#039;s being a pervert and theres oppais everywhere.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
Theres not much to say about the art, it dosen&#039;t look half bad, the colours look nice, the animation is smooth. Overall its ok, not much to say but it fits the show. A little more detail can be put in but its ok, overall.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
For a show filled with fanservice, the music is really well done! The opening is a very nice and calm tune showing you what to expect in this show. The ending is this great and upbeat tune kind of like you&#039;re watching a play and you&#039;re about to leave and they put this Up beat song, this is probably what it would be. Songs go from slow and beautiful tones to Epic and Mighty tunes pumping up your heart! The sound quality is overall well done and good as hell.<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
There are 3 main characters that we are focused on. First you got Issei, typical pervert, At times I like Issei at times I hate him, he usually does everything wrong that just makes me wanna kick his ass until he realizes he&#039;s an idiot. At times he could actually be pretty humurous and make some ol&#039;jokes. Then you got Rias, she&#039;s a pretty good character, she usually does whats best for Issei and sure she only changes a bit in the end of the series but you just can&#039;t help but like  her. Then you got Asia, your cliched character who falls in love with the MC, will get jealous if someone trys to do anything romantic with him and the usual cliches. Her backstory is pretty explainable itself but she&#039;s too generic. The character developements aren&#039;t really strong and feel meh, like they aren&#039;t trying.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
Without the humor, fanservice, filler and oppai this show would be pretty boring, so I give props for that stuff being there, overall this show will hook you from the start and you&#039;ll probably watch it till the end. <br />
<br />
Overall: 7//10<br />
This show is enjoyable and pretty good overall. I have no problem with fanservice so I was able to watch this at ease. If you have a problem with fanservice or overall hate it. Stay from this show like its poop. If not you&#039;ll easily enjoy this show, if you go through this show without fapping once, you&#039;re tough enough to be in the weenies club. Cause theres a LOT of fappable content, so make sure you have some lotion ready before watching this.

    ** FOR THOSE WHO CAN&quot;T BE BOTHERED TO READ** <br />
<br />
First of all i&#039;m telling to just watch it is great!! <br />
it has the good story concepts and really balanced characters for an ecchi anime, with not much weird angled camera shots like between the legs and other stuff when the story is progressing good if you want best of both worlds. fan-services are about 10~20% in each EP so not much for those looking for it.  At the end of watching you will feel like its a normal anime but not at the same time because of the nudity. <br />
<br />
END you can stop reading

          <span style="display: none;" id="review133935">
        now.... just go watch and rate the review if you find it helpful and please watch at least 5ep before dropping it #justsaying. <br />
<br />
Other Notes :<br />
<br />
the main character is quite well thought out and he actually works to prove his worth and make&#039;s girls fall for him him that I can say is what a harem anime should be. Guys proving themselves it makes more scenes that way <br />
<br />
other then that Sound,art are great too. nude scenes are well shown with good reason (most of the time) <br />
most are due to fights but not just because they need to add fan services but it does add the realistically to the show<br />
other reason well... you&#039;ll just have to watch..<br />
<br />
if you are still here you must like to read. <br />
if you like please message me if you find it of help or you can share your thoughts about the review. <br />
<br />
thoughts , <br />
I really like this show and it has proven that anime is not just about boobs <br />
wish there where more shows like this imagine one piece or bleach had clothes ripping apart haha <br />
just kidding though but would like to see a long anime with that.. <br />
<br />

    First of all, what i don&#039;t get is why would someone complain about ecchi, i don&#039;t get it, it makes no sense, of all the things one could complain about, it has to be ecchi?<br />
<br />
Well my friend, let me tell you, half, if not, the majority of people who watch this anime are watching it solely for the fanservice, it&#039;s called &quot;Fan service&quot; for a reason, but really, why would the developers bother putting fanservice in an anime if people didn&#039;t like it? just these past 3 months more than 5 ecchi animes were aired, so stop being a lil phag and grow up, as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review53431">
        a fellow human, i don&#039;t see why would you complain about it? it just makes things more entertaining.<br />
<br />
Now for the anime, i personally haven&#039;t watched it yet, but it looks quite interesting, and i&#039;d be rather disappointed if it ended at 12 episodes, the plot, the characters, the ecchi, everything looks exciting, so for all of you Action/Ecchi/Harem/Romance/Fantasy fans, this is the anime for you.

    Overview:<br />
<br />
Both film and television have a great number of genres and sub-genres. Some of these sub-genres are quite easy to pull off, like the &quot;jump scare&quot; adolescent horror movies that Blumhouse shits out every year! All you have to do is follow the same cookie cutter formula and your low budget schlock film will make back at least 800% of its budget and receive decent reviews! One of the most difficult sub-genres to actually execute well is the &quot;completely self aware, so bad it&#039;s good comedy&quot;. Many studios and directors attempt to tackle this sub-genre with films like &quot;Sharknado&quot; or &quot;Snakes on a Plane&quot; but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review197326">
        almost ALWAYS the result ends up being boring and predictable instead of actually funny and amusing. Anime studios have also recently entered into this sub-genre with shows like High School of the Dead, but  High school DxD largely succeeds where High school of the Dead fell flat on its face. DxD remembers to NEVER take itself seriously and most importantly to keep its jokes and line delivery actually funny! <br />
<br />
Plot:<br />
<br />
Do you like boobs? Do you like lots of blood? Do you like not being bothered with such cumbersome inconveniences as character development or a well written plot? This is the show for you! DxD is a story about a pervert that joins a largely female school to try gain his own harem. Instead he remains a virgin and a social pariah until the power of his bullshit &quot;MacGuffin&quot; forces him to choose a side in a faction war between Demons, Angels, and Fallen Angels. The Demon faction are different from the fallen angels and were not created by Jehovah unlike the Angels and Fallen Angels. In the beginning of time, several powerful races came into being including Gods (of whom Jehovah is one of many), the demons, and the dragons. Jehovah/Allah unlike his brothers Zeus and Odin decided to try wipe out the Demons and created the Angels as his personal army. However, some of the angels were immoral and slept with human women, so Jehovah/Allah cast them out and they became the Fallen Angels or &quot;Grigori&quot;. The fallen Angels tried to exterminate the Demons in order to win back Jehovah&#039;s favor, but Jehovah decided to declare war on both factions and start a 3 way war. This war devastated the ranks of the 3 armies and killed both Jehovah and the 4 original Demon Kings called &quot;Satans&quot;. To the present day an uneasy truce has been kept between the surviving members of these factions. The plot in addition to absurd comedy, shameless fanservice, and slapstick serves as a giant FUCK YOU to religion and insults every religion in equal measure. It&#039;s almost as if Bill Maher wrote this series...only its too funny for him to have been the author. DxD frequently references other anime and is VERY aware of all the tropes it is using including ripping off DBZ and perpetually name dropping obscure demons, angels, and other kaballah related terms as a middle finger to Evangelion&#039;s admittedly insufferable use of this technique.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The characters from the main male protagonist Issei to the female protagonist Rias are very cardboard archetypes. The series doesn&#039;t take itself seriously and never actually tries to develop these characters because the entire point of the series is to be enjoyably idiotic bullshit. This was actually the right move for DxD because it becomes very annoying when a REALLY stupid series actually tries to take itself seriously and demands that the viewer respect its dignity. I&#039;m looking at you Seikon no Qwasar!<br />
<br />
Art and sound:<br />
<br />
The art predictably features absurdly large breasts that move in ways that completely fuck the laws of physics. However, unlike Maoyuu Yuusha, which has similar breasts and then suddenly demands that the viewer put on a sophisticated cap and discuss theories of agricultural distribution, DxD KNOWS how stupid its breasts are and revels in it! The English dub is actually excellent and the soundtrack is decent. Overall, surprisingly not bad from a purely technical view.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
High School DxD is NOT a good anime by any means. However, it knows exactly how to be that special type of bad that is still for some reason amusing. You will grin like the Cheshire Cat while watching a train wreck in slow motion! I&#039;m not saying I actually recommend this series, but if you want echii bullshit you could do WAY worse! At least this series is WAY better than Food Wars!

    just to be straight forward here.... i saw the picture of this anime and just happens to watch it for... stuff.... , and it just so happens there&#039;s alot.. so those of you who think you&#039;re &quot;not a pervert&quot; and don&#039;t like nudity don&#039;t watch it .... <br />
but as i watch this i realize that the story is better than i though it would be. so in conclusion, everyone that think that anime with harem, or ecchi in it are not good, will that&#039;s wrong, cuz this animei combine the fan service really good when the moment comes. <br />
if you don&#039;t like nudity in any

          <span style="display: none;" id="review60849">
        way just please ignore this anime.... i really hope highschool DxD could be more.. popular but those who just watch the first episode and quit, then give it a bad rate are just disgrace...<br />
just watch it all the way guys/gals and then rate it when you&#039;re finished this anime is much better than any ecchi, fanservice anime i watched so far so i really hope there&#039;ll be a second season

    I find it very easy to hate DxD. The content isn&#039;t why, though. Anybody can see a floppy anime tit and dismiss it as being too base for them. That&#039;s not worth a discussion, let alone a review. It won&#039;t make any statement greater than getting people who hate fanservice to smash that upvote button. So fuck it.<br />
<br />
Instead, I want to present my contempt for DxD from the perspective of somebody who loves this type of shit. Because yes, I love ecchi. I love how ecchi is about jack-knifing sexualization and more traditional types of content and characterization. At the same time, I love that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406604">
        it still veers more towards the stupid and pornographic than it does the thematic and substantial. I also love what it represents on a grander scale, beyond what&#039;s put before the audience. <br />
<br />
Remember that last one. It&#039;s important. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
So, before we dig deeper into the series itself, let me lay some groundwork. I&#039;m under the impression that in order to understand why DxD sucks so much, we need to understand what makes it work for so many people. Plenty of people do like this series, and it&#039;s not like I&#039;m sitting here with a stupid look on my face trying to understand why. It&#039;s not hard to figure out if you think about it long enough. <br />
<br />
DxD has two contrasting elements that end up developing synergy in their execution - a traditional action narrative and a lot of fanservice scenes. They&#039;re not connected in any meaningful way. It doesn&#039;t make any kind of thematic statement on sexuality, either. No narrative relevance. None of that shit that outsiders like to fawn over so much in their piss poor forum posts or Twitter hot takes. <br />
<br />
Rather, the synergy between narrative and fanservice in DxD stems from the relative simplicity of both. The traditional action narrative I spoke of isn&#039;t anything groundbreaking by itself. The MC, Issei, has a special power. He gets his ass kicked sometimes. He powers up and comes through with the power of friendship or tits or something. Rinse and repeat, the only differences being aesthetic and the growing sense of scale that each new arc brings to the table. <br />
<br />
A lot of people have pointed to the emphasis DxD places on narrative as a primary point of defense to me when I&#039;ve criticized this series in the past, but let&#039;s be real - if we removed all fanservice from DxD, nobody would fucking talk about this shit. Nobody talks about DxD power scaling, that&#039;d be stupid. Nobody talks about how epic any of the fights are, either, or how dope the pseudo-religious backdrop is. None of that matters by itself, because none of it is interesting by itself. It&#039;s about as bog-standard as you can get with an action narrative. <br />
<br />
This series is still distinguished *because* of its fanservice, which it does have in spades. We&#039;re not going to have to sit there and debate on whether it&#039;s an ecchi anime or a mere anime with fanservice. This isn&#039;t Fire Force or Shokugeki. It&#039;s a fucking ecchi. <br />
<br />
Yet, I&#039;m under the impression that DxD&#039;s fanservice is just too basic to be a selling point by itself. Nothing about how it implements fanservice makes it exceptional relative to its field. It relies on the most basic exposure shots *to an extremity* and it repeats those shots over and over again, redrawn, but not different. Is seeing a bare nipple enough to give you some Looney Toons-esque, heart-beating-out-of-your-chest reaction? It&#039;s not for me. I stopped being 14 a decade ago. A tit is a fucking tit. <br />
<br />
We compare shit to other shit we&#039;ve watched. Almost everyone does. If you rate one series an 8 and another a 7, you&#039;ve compared them to one another and said the 7 was worse. If we don&#039;t factor in DxD&#039;s emphasis on a traditional action narrative, DxD&#039;s ecchi is like, a 2 compared to other ecchi. If what you want is an ecchi, there are hundreds of much better options for that. They go further with how explicit they&#039;re willing to be. They have better characters with more meat to latch onto. They&#039;re centered on this element of their identity and wear it on their sleeves. There&#039;s a lot of dope ecchi content out there, and you&#039;re missing out on it if you think DxD is at the apex of what the genre has to offer in that regard. Ecchi isn&#039;t any more of a strong suit for it than narrative is.<br />
<br />
This is where DxD&#039;s synergy between narrative and ecchi kicks in. <br />
<br />
The narrative kind of sucks, right? It&#039;s nothing great, but it&#039;s familiar territory. That&#039;s what&#039;s important - it&#039;s barren ground that other series have treaded time and time again. It&#039;ll take somebody who is unfamiliar with ecchi, yet familiar with more mainstream types of anime, and put them in friendly territory. It&#039;s something they know. It&#039;s something they can digest and understand. It&#039;s not going to weird them out or come on too strong with the Harem&amp;Ecchi elements, because it&#039;s kind of like that one battle shounen they like, but with tits. <br />
<br />
And the ecchi kind of sucks, right? Well, maybe if you&#039;re iffy about fanservice in anime, it&#039;s not. It&#039;s so safe and conservative that it&#039;s hard for it to offend anyone. It&#039;s got quantity, but it lacks any desire to push the envelope with its sexual content. It rests on its laurels, making everything always trace back to being a sequence of basic exposure shots. <br />
<br />
But if you take shitty, conservative ecchi and mix it with a narrative that&#039;s derivative and safe, you get synergy for a specific type of audience member - the type of people who watch anime but don&#039;t watch ecchi. It has a good shot at removing the weird element of watching a straight up-ecchi anime for someone who wouldn&#039;t. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s where it succeeds. It&#039;s so safe for the genre&#039;s standards that people who may be uncomfortable watching an ecchi can watch something like DxD and feel more at ease with themselves. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not great because of its narrative, and it&#039;s not great because of its ecchi. It&#039;s because the simplicity of both of those elements come together to create a safe environment for people who might otherwise feel insecure in watching something like this. <br />
<br />
--- <br />
<br />
You *might* have the wrong idea of where I&#039;m going with this now, so let me clarify something. DxD is a kickass gateway for getting people into ecchi anime, and I think that&#039;s awesome. I am all for getting more people into the ecchi fandom. I don&#039;t like or promote trying to get people into anime itself for the sake of &quot;introducing your friends to your hobbies&quot; or whatever, but if people want to try out ecchi on their own terms and end up liking it, I think that&#039;s great. DxD being the way it is *does* make it a great point of entry for people who are unsure whether they&#039;d like Harem&amp;Ecchi anime. <br />
<br />
DxD doesn&#039;t suck because it&#039;s a gateway anime. No. DxD sucks because it&#039;s too conservative. Lemme try to illustrate this. <br />
<br />
In the first OVA, they go to some museum-type thing, fight some Egyptian-type thing, and after they&#039;re done, a tentacle monster swoops in and begins grabbing up the girls. Tentacles are fucking weird, yo. That&#039;s not what you&#039;d expect to see out of a conservative ecchi anime, so I was hype. It was being different. I&#039;m not even big on scenes like tentacle scenes, yet I&#039;m all for this shit. After being subjected to clothes dissolution -&gt; basic exposure shot like, seven times an episode throughout the first season, it was going out there and getting ready to push the envelope and be explicit and lewd. <br />
<br />
The tentacle monsters grab the girls. They scream and squirm and cry for help, all of that rape-y shit. <br />
<br />
Then the tentacle monster secretes a toxic substance or something. Then their clothes dissolve. <br />
<br />
Then it does a basic exposure shot. <br />
<br />
It looms over one girl&#039;s chest for a few seconds. Then the next. Then the next. <br />
<br />
Then it&#039;s done and they beat up the tentacle monster. <br />
<br />
It started doing something different. Something out there. Whether that&#039;s my scene or not, it built up the expectation it was going to do *something* that wasn&#039;t a basic exposure shot. Then it turned that into a series of basic exposure shots. Just like that, I went from intrigued to seeing the series bombard me with the same dull shots I&#039;d seen a million times during the previous season. It teased pushing the boundaries, then it defaulted back to being as conservative and safe with ecchi as it could get. <br />
<br />
Fuck off. <br />
<br />
I watched DxD at around the same time I did To LOVE-Ru, too. I switched back to TLR after that episode. <br />
<br />
One of the main scenes of the TLR episode that I watched afterward had a bit where one of Lala&#039;s inventions malfunctions, which is pretty much the most typical TLR ecchi scenario setup in that series. This invention is a telephone that&#039;s supposed to do...something else, I don&#039;t even remember what, but the unintended result is that it makes the person on the receiving end of the call begin to orgasm. <br />
<br />
When Rito makes a call to Yui, we get this awesome prolonged masturbation scene that was borderline - if not outright - pornographic. Not some fucking basic exposure shot. Not something that&#039;s on the screen for a few seconds before switching off. It was an entire scene constructed around sexualizing a woman masturbating due to this weird pheromone phone. And I loved it. This is what ecchi could be! It can be an ecchi! It can show lewd shit! It can fire up your fantasies and stoke your imagination! You can masturbate to a series like To LOVE-Ru and I wouldn&#039;t find it weird, yet if you said the same about a series like DxD, I&#039;d be side-eyeing you.<br />
<br />
The reason it&#039;d be so weird for one and not the other is because of this difference in execution. TLR goes places. It prolongs scenes and doesn&#039;t shy away from being what it is - an ecchi. Doing the same for a series like DxD would be fapping to a bunch of brief basic exposure shots interspersed with mediocre action scenes. That&#039;d be...strange. <br />
<br />
--- <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, ecchi is rebellious. Refusing to conform to what people want and demand of you rests at its foundation. The series I compared DxD to earlier, To LOVE-Ru, was the subject of intense government scrutiny under Tokyo&#039;s Healthy Youth Development Initiative and how unrepentant it was in being explicit. It risked getting banned from being sold in Tokyo, which would have killed its publication.<br />
<br />
The mangaka for To LOVE-Ru responded that government pressure by pushing TLR even farther and harder than he had before. He began doing shit like slipping subliminal pussy shots into his manga to sneak that in there, *as* the government was coming down on his work. That&#039;s fucking awesome. <br />
<br />
The Japanese government doesn&#039;t like ecchi. Most ecchi-centric manga mags got fucking axed by them and the HYDI, and creators had to disperse to having their content put at the backend of more &quot;acceptable&quot; magazines. <br />
<br />
Networks don&#039;t like it much. They&#039;ll stop airing this as soon as it steps out of line. See Interspecies Reviewers, another ecchi that made it a point to go as far as it could while still being comedic and having fun characters. <br />
<br />
You don&#039;t make a lot of money making ecchi content, contrary to popular perception, so that&#039;s out the window. Any anecdote from a creator of ecchi content will make as much crystal clear. Even the author for Redo of Healer admitted that in a recent interview he did on YouTube when he talked about making lewd shit, and that guy was transparent about being in it for the cash. <br />
<br />
We&#039;re never on top sales charts. We&#039;re always at the back of manga mags. The floor and the ceiling are both lower whenever you take the established myth that &quot;sex sells&quot; and look at the experiences of creators and actual numbers. <br />
<br />
It sure as fuck doesn&#039;t have much legitimacy in the eyes of non-ecchi anime fans, either. It wasn&#039;t even that long ago where I was having an otherwise decent conversation about anime with somebody who knew I was an ecchi fan, and when we talked about anime he felt the need to assert that he &quot;liked real anime, y&#039;know?&quot; - in comparison to me, the degenerate, irresponsible ecchi fan. <br />
<br />
Do we need another forum thread or review complaining about the presence of fanservice in anime to make it clear that no shortage of outsider fans view what we like as illegitimate and less valuable than what they think anime should be? Considering that&#039;s more common than shitty isekai LN adaptations, I don&#039;t think we do. <br />
<br />
We&#039;re here though, man. We&#039;re too weird to be normal anime fans, and we&#039;re too story and character-centric to be hentai. Nobody outside of us seems to like the middle ground we occupy, and yet the genre we gather around persists. It&#039;s not dying anytime soon, at least as far as I can tell. We still stand as an antithesis to people&#039;s idea of how media should be categorized, and that&#039;s despite copious amounts of opposition. <br />
<br />
Yet, by being so conservative, everything that DxD&#039;s existence represents is antithetical to that entire ethos surrounding ecchi. It&#039;s an anime that is only shameless in how willing it is to kowtow to what others can consider &quot;normal,&quot; and it accomplishes that through being safe, conservative, and boring. DxD represents subservience. It represents refusing to push the envelope with sexual content. It represents making something surrounded by an ethos of refusing to corrode into conformity and making that as safe and approved by the masses as it possibly can be. If To LOVE-Ru represents being willing to die on your feet, DxD represents living on your knees.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not what ecchi is, and it sure as fuck isn&#039;t what it should be. There&#039;s a lot of great ecchi out there. If this is your first stop with ecchi, I hope you manage to find the great stuff that lies beyond the gate. I really do.<br />

    This series causes me all the negative things that I don&#039;t want to see in a series, the hypersexualization of women is something that I hate, ok?<br />
<br />
History 1 / 10:<br />
<br />
The story is mediocre, the scenes are badly spun, the fights are badly done, the protagonist wins without meaning, the scenes are forced, and every 5 seconds the series shows you a tit on the screen, I mean, if the series shows boobs every 5 seconds so you don&#039;t get bored makes you notice how BAD it is<br />
<br />
Art and Animation 3/10:<br />
<br />
The art of this series is something ... unaesthetic and unpleasant, the characters are poorly proportioned,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354648">
        rather the female characters, the backgrounds are OK, there is nothing that attracts attention, very average, the animation is fine, sometimes it is something weird.<br />
<br />
OST and Voice Acting 3 / 10:<br />
<br />
The voice acting is good, it has a good choice of seiyuus, but the OST, is VERY AVERAGE, you don&#039;t remember any song ... there is a song that does, which is used for most of the times that Rias appears in a window.<br />
<br />
OP and ED 5.6 / 10:<br />
<br />
I like the opening, the lyrics are good and they fit in with the anime, I just think that this series does not deserve that opening. The ending is average but it is catchy, although it is somewhat irritating in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Character and Character Design 1 / 10:<br />
<br />
The character design is fine, I like it, it&#039;s simple. THE CHARACTERS, OH MY GOD THIS IS THE WORST OF THE SERIES. The characters are so flat that they feel like cardboard, Issei is irritating, his idealization is bad wherever you want it see.Asia is unpleasant and useless, Rias has no purpose in the series, literally, she has no personality, she is only to command others, be president, and show boobs, nothing else. I do not understand Koneko, she seems to me the typical loli tsundere that gives fanservice, Akeno only says ArA arA arA..and nothing else, she shows boobs and accompanies Rias, Yuuto had some potential but it was wasted.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 1/10:<br />
<br />
It was difficult to finish the series because the hypersexualization bothered me and that it would show boobs all the time, it was super boring, the series, I do not recommend watching it, better watch other series that are not this one please.<br />
<br />

    Welcome to the world of beautiful demonic girls! Anime offers beautiful ladies and great fights. It was fun watching and I would definitely recommend it for men than for women, admittedly I&#039;m a girl, but despite this I had fun watching this anime, so the girl may also like it, probably. Ecchi was a bit too much in total, but I turned a blind eye. I wasn&#039;t disappointed in this anime, although I had a bad feeling about it, luckily it turned out to be a good comedy with a hint of romance.<br />
<br />
✿Story 7/10 - The story is not somehow original, but even ok. If

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334835">
        there were more romance then it would be much better. The anime tells the story of a boy who, after death, concludes a contract with a demonic girl, and then is her servant, a pawn in the game. Too much ecchi, too little romance and action, which is a pity.<br />
<br />
✿Art 9/10 - Some may think I&#039;m kidding, but this line has stolen my heart. The character&#039;s eyes are something beautiful, the animation is smooth and the colors are very nice.<br />
<br />
✿Sound 9/10 - Admittedly I&#039;ve seen better openings and endings, but these certainly deserve such a high rating! I didn&#039;t even rewind them because they were pleasant to listen to.<br />
<br />
✿Characters 6/10 - The best women in the anime.. Female characters were AMAZING, but most of the male characters... And here it spilled ... I don&#039;t want to tell spoilers, but the male characters in this anime are a tragedy... Well, I&#039;ll start discuss the main characters.<br />
<br />
→ Gremory Rias 10/10 - My second favorite character in this anime. Calm, firm and intelligent, that&#039;s what Rias is. She isn&#039;t annoying which makes me very happy. Her design is wonderful and her eyes are beautiful.<br />
<br />
→ Hyoudou Issei 5/10 - I do not give him an exaggerated low score, because at some moments he was cool, but I&#039;m begging you, seriously the guy thinks only about one thing all the time? His design is even ok, but I don&#039;t like his hair a bit.<br />
<br />
→ Himejima Akeno 8/10 - I think she&#039;s a great character, calm and sadistic. She wasn&#039;t annoying, her design is ok.<br />
<br />
→ Toujou Koneko 10/10 - My favorite character in this anime. Calm and sweet kuudere girl. She was the only one who blame Issei for his perverted thoughs. her design is the best in the anime, she is so cute that you can get diabetes.<br />
<br />
→ Argento Asia 7/10 - A charming character, sometimes annoying, but bearable. Design has beautiful.<br />
<br />
→ Kiba Yuuto 7/10 - The best male character in this anime. he wasn&#039;t annoying or perverted. His design is ok.<br />
<br />
→ Other male characters reach 3/10... ←<br />
<br />
✿Enjyoment 10/10 - I had a great time watching this anime. Specific humor, but even ok. A little too much ecchi, but as I mentioned earlier, it is possible to survive.<br />
<br />
✿Total 8/10✿ - The overall rating is 8.20, this anime definitely deserves such an assessment (●&#039;◡&#039;●)<br />
<br />
Sorry for grammatical errors, I&#039;m a young person and English is not my native language o(TヘTo)

    Every once in a while an anime comes around that is so well done you have an eyegasm after every episode, simply put a masterpiece......<br />
yeah, this isn&#039;t really that anime.<br />
<br />
From personal observations I&#039;ve noticed that people who can&#039;t stand fanservice shoot down an anime because of fanservice. I find them to be more annoying and painful than bamboo splinters under my fingernails. I dont really understand why they keep watching, if thats the type of anime they hate with a passion, then why? Are they masochists? Are they closet pervs who just don&#039;t want to admit it? The fact of the matter is that if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review83317">
        you&#039;re against it this anime isn&#039;t for you, no need to keep reading. If you don&#039;t like ecchi, dont watch it!<br />
<br />
Now onto the actual review.<br />
<br />
The Bad<br />
-the main issue with harems is the character development, this be no exception. The main character is the stereotypical average student with a now common &quot;want to protect&quot; mindset. I didn&#039;t really see much character development, however I, from my view point, did see some (I mentioning feel explaining would spoil) but I can&#039;t truly knock it down too much, unlike if it was to be a series with much more time in which i would have been pissed. <br />
-I found the plot to be nothing really special and has a set up that I feel I&#039;ve seen before.<br />
-The plot did have its holes and unanswered questions by the end, with only a temporary resolution yet its not that big of an issue because they were things that could easily be answered in the second season, unless they explain fuck all in the next season, at which time i will pray the director&#039;s crab&#039;s get herpies.<br />
-The setting, you guest it, a highschool, i need not go on.<br />
-The animation was really nothing exceptional there is very much a lack of eyegasm in this sense as nothing really pops out at you except boobs and someone&#039;s boner if not your own.<br />
-The music didn&#039;t leave ear bleeding, but was only slightly above good.<br />
-I will say it. At times, the ecchi does get very excessive however I don&#039;t qualify that as an excuse to throw this in the crap pile, its not really that unbearable.<br />
<br />
The good<br />
-to redeem the setting itself, it did have some diversity because even though the title of the anime is high school dxd, i found the situations to have nearly nothing to do with high school. There is the clubhouse but they normally just meet and move elsewhere from there. I just found it to be more of a building/base than an average school. <br />
-The comedy (probably a bit bias here) was the type I find funny, I am very much the type to appreciate a sexual joke, don&#039;t give a dam if Im called a perv at least I dont hide it, but there are some other mixed in. <br />
-Idk if accel world  made me realize this but I did notice that the chicks in this anime don&#039;t just magically fall in love with him left and right, which I find to be preferable. The ones that do fall for him are ones that have a reason to after some connection between them and it doesnt happen with every fucking girl.<br />
-There were some action scenes that coming into the fight gave me chills and that &quot;shits about to go down&quot; feeling we all love.<br />
<br />
The unexplainable<br />
From everything gathered it would be guessed that this is just a regular anime with not much to offer as with average animation, sound, plot, ext. However, the fact of the matter is this anime is on my favorites list to this day. Why? its obvious I&#039;m aware of its flaws, then why? truthfully I can&#039;t explain it.<br />
Looking at it from a reviewer&#039;s perspective this is just an average anime. <br />
Yet, looking at it from an average viewer who values enjoyment value above all else, I truly loved it. Idk maybe its just im more indecisive than Romney, but I found it to be enjoyable as fuck. This anime just has that &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; feel. Its the kind of weird shit that if people were to come into my room I would switch to porn, because that is just so much easier to explain. So many people I know bash its flaws, yet can&#039;t wait for a second season. I went through this shit in a siting and was glad I did.<br />
<br />
The verdict<br />
Overall I give this anime a rating of guilty pleasure that through its flaws is just inexplicably addictive.<br />
I recommend (unless ur allergic to boobs and ass and life)

    With such series&#039; like Rosario Vampire and Aki-Sora, the ecchi and harem genre has never been stronger. It is with such series going around that the genre being what it is that makes High School DxD an instant hit for fans of the genre. On the surface, it&#039;s an over-the-top, high-paced, fan-serviced spectacle that many fans of this genre love. With its rather cliche plot and possibly even more cliche characters, it&#039;ll capture you granted that you don&#039;t mind tits and asses.<br />
<br />
Storywise, it starts out slow. The build-up is slow and the way the overall premise is established is slightly faster, but still very much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review166371">
        slow. The story goes through two arcs in the first season. Possibly one of the highlights is the insults of the writing. Yes, I definitely think that the insults and the multiple ways of calling a person a douche and even the multiple terms for wanting to have sex with someone. Granted, sometimes the writing interferes with the story, but as I stated, the story itself is a bit cliche, but it catches on and somehow you&#039;ll find yourself being drawn to it.<br />
<br />
I think one of the most impressive things about this series is the art style. It&#039;s with the art that one is drawn to an anime or manga first. We look with our eyes before we read and delve into the universe presented to us in the visual form. The fluid animation brings an added bonus to the art itself. It just might be the best thing about the series. <br />
<br />
The musical score and other such sound effects really brought the series to life. With a brilliant composer such as Ryosuke Nakanishi, it&#039;s hard not to just fall deeply in love with the music. I will admit that at times it slightly felt out of place, but that&#039;s only in the smallest of ways. <br />
<br />
As stated beforehand, the characters took a while to build and some of them had cliche moments, but there definitely was a good amount of heart put forth into them. As much as the series is fan service, the characters showed surprising development in the twelve episodes. That&#039;s not to say that there weren&#039;t moments where I had my doubts — cause there were. There were even some characters that I felt that could have been left out. Hell, there were even some characters that I felt were wasted opportunities. Still, with that being said, I felt the main characters, at least, were handled well.<br />
<br />
So, overall the series is good for those who like harem, ecchi, laugh-out-loud moments, and over-the-top action that makes one question their sanity. It&#039;s a good time and the heart is there. My final score is 7/10.

    If you are no fan of the ecchi genre, please exit this review and spend your time on other reviews. I&#039;ve been hearing adults say that the arts nowadays are not really emphasised. Well, I beg to differ. Body art is an aspect of art in which many people are spending time in. Animes also have quite a decent amount of genre with the aspect of body art a.k.a ecchi genres. Of course, this anime too. Read the synopsis your own as I&#039;m diving straight through into the review.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
  THIS ISN&#039;T PORN! It&#039;s just ecchi. All of my friends were like OMG! YOU WATCH

          <span style="display: none;" id="review105973">
        PORN! Come on. It&#039;s categorised as ecchi not hentai. You might think I&#039;m lying but this anime honestly has a good plot. Many of my friends were like: Yeah you watch this anime for the &quot;plot&quot;. Seriously, if you were to watch this anime without labelling it, it actually has an impressive and interesting plot. First Issei gets reborn as a devil. Few episodes dedicated to introduce other characters and for character development purposes. Towards the end of the anime was the most exciting part of this anime. The Rating Game. Really really cool. During that time my heart gets pumping so vigorously that I can feel its sheer impact. Again, it&#039;s the plot that made my heart pump so hard, rarely to do with the body art.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
  Nothing much to comment about the art. Quite decently done for a 2012 anime. Really beautiful and impressive art I should say.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
  Not a main aspect of this anime in my opinion. However, I do agree that the Opening song was very catchy. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
  A very important aspect of this anime. Issei(MC)- pervertic and oh that&#039;s all. He&#039;s always thinking about oppai no matter what. Be it when everyone is in danger or when everyone is taking a rest. Anytime and anywhere. Rias-a high-ranking devil. Nothing much to talk about except for the fact that she&#039;s really beautiful and powerful. Akeno- hehehe. I challenge you to not wiki her when watching the anime. Quite an interesting and unexpected character. Asia- she should just buzz off. Ugly, annoying, extra and weak. Can practically do nothing much. Kiba- nothing much to comment on. Koneko-I would term her as a silent killer. Watch to find out why I call her that.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
  With a fairly decent and interesting plot topped with the aspect of body art, How could one agree that this anime is lousy and boring? Really, trust me. This anime has indeed a very interesting plot especially towards the end where they played The Rating Game. I would say I really enjoyed this anime. Please do not watch this in front of your parents as they might just label this as porn. Alternatively, you could agree that you are pursuing your passion for body art since people nowadays are more likely to be pursuing something that would pay them well. I think you could more or less get away with it.<br />
<br />
Thank you

    Disclaimer: This was the first anime I ever watched, so I probably enjoyed it more than the average anime lover :3<br />
<br />
This anime is good, great, fantastic! It&#039;s full of hilarious moments, badass action scenes, and an admirable try-hard main character. When I watched High School DxD, the fantasy really stood out for me (although I didn&#039;t have any other anime to compare it to at the time). The magic circles, giant dragons, explosions and amazing super powers that made the eyes drool (metaphorically), it was truly a great start to my life as an otaku. <br />
<br />
Looking back, the story and character development was pretty weak,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review164829">
        but that&#039;s besides the point. I didn&#039;t watch it for the story and characters. I enjoyed the art, I loved Issei&#039;s perverted antics and the priceless looks on his face when anything lewd happened. It made for a hilarious watching and that is why I have rated my enjoyment so high. Considering I had never before seen a show about a perverted boy and giant boobs (and small boobs for that matter), this show felt fresh, daring and exciting and it had me at the edge of my seat gawping and thinking &#039;DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN???&#039;. <br />
<br />
Another point is the random, and often too plentiful changes in mood that the show went through. Halfway through fights which are supposed to be serious and cool, are interjected by sexual jokes and slapstick comedy. Depending on what you like, it&#039;s either a blessing or a reason to not watch the show. Although I would say this show is mainly a comedy so expect silliness galore! <br />
<br />
Finally, I must warn you of the amount of fanservice this show contains (For those of you unsure what I mean, there are boobs everywhere, and quite often the inappropriate panty shot. (Those Japanese... *sighs*) If you&#039;re not into it, then you will probably find this show difficult to watch. But, if you&#039;re an avid anime fan, you&#039;re probably used to it so you shouldn&#039;t mind. And remember, this show is ecchi - not hentai. There is no sex in this show! <br />
<br />
All in all, I loved the show. It is a great laugh and has great fantasy elements! The OP and ED songs are very enjoyable and as a whole, I highly recommend High School DxD to those who like magic and high school boy shows (and aren&#039;t too put off by the fanservice). I hope this review helped you a little bit! (ᕑᗢूᓫ∗)
