    This has got the be my pick for the hidden gem of Summer Season 2021. A truly unique and entertaining anime going against almost all of the Isekai genre&#039;s Stereotypes. While the show did have a slightly mediocre first few episodes it really picked up it&#039;s pace shortly after and became the series i was looking forward to the most each week.<br />
<br />
First things first, my only real criticism for the show: The production feels really cheap. And while I am not sure whether this was intended or not by the studio, I won&#039;t sit here and pretend that it adds some sort of charm to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418072">
        the show. It doesn&#039;t! <br />
The art and animation makes you think you are watching something from around 2007. It is another one of those animes where you can&#039;t tell if it has more than 2 soundtracks besides OP and ED (which are really good imo btw but more to that later) and while the music is sort of fitting to most scenes and adds at least something to the show, it is nothing to write home about. So if you are hoping for an Unlimited Budget Works production you will find yourself disappointed.<br />
<br />
Story: The premise of the show is that the Main Character Ninomija, after having achieved success in his own world, is suddenly teleported to another world and immediately turned into a corporate slave by a company that treats it&#039;s employees more like drones than sapient beings. His only light at the end of the tunnel: An incredibly cute and OP demon girl with an endless desire for food. The rest of the story is a harder to explain cause it is quite wild, constantly jumping around from one plotpoint to another with the only real overarching storyline being the MC&#039;s party trying to get out of the grasps of the evil corporation they are working for.It&#039;s a very goofy concept that clearly more intended to entertain than inspire and it does an amazing job at it as i found myself laughing at a good portion of the show while watching. I often found myself at the start of episodes asking myself if i missed something inbetween and exactly that turned out to give the show a lot of it&#039;s appeal as you could never expect what was coming next. Despite having it&#039;s focus on humor there are many scenes that are either cute, wholesome or even thought proviking. <br />
<br />
Characters: You rarely see an Anime with a lineup as diverse and loveable as Black Company. The Protagonist is one of the best Male MCs you will come by in the Anime Industry. He is witty, charismatic and doesn&#039;t want to take shit from anyone. His problem tho is that he is a weakling in an Isekai world that is ruled by evil industrialism that treats people as labor slaves. Making the Protagonist unable to get out of his predicament on his own. Luckily he ends up being accompanied by a Trap Wizard, an adorable and OP af dragon girl with an unsatiable hunger, a crazy Hero loyal to the evil company and a completely level headed lizard man that would most likely prefer minding his own business rather than being part of this story. Trying his best to act as a leader to this crazy group of people the MC sometimes manages to get things done while failing miserably at others, all while slowly establishing closer relationships with the party&#039;s members and having some fun on the way. <br />
<br />
The Opening of the anime is a very fitting one imo staying true to the goofy vibes that the show is mostly about. However, it is the Ending that is the cherry on top. As i don&#039;t want to take anything away from the experience i will have you look it up yourself. All i am saying is is that it puts the Love is War Chika Dance ED to shame. <br />
<br />
Ultimately i was debating whether this was a 9 or 10 for me and eventually ended up deciding on a 9 as the Anime does an excellent job in the important departments of Characters, Story and overall Entertainment but could have been even greater with a slightly better Animation und Sound usage. Regardless of that a clear recommendation for anyone who is looking for humorful Entertainment.

    It has been a long time since I&#039;ve seen a good isekai and this one really stands out..<br />
The basic plot is the mc is transported into another with no power no special skills no game screen and all.<br />
He is made to work in  mining where the employees are exploited by the higher ups. The mc is very cunning and tries to become rich with his wit and thats the basic gist of the show.<br />
The best parts of the show is of course the mc, he is cunning, confident , manipulative and does not possess any other special skill, strength or smartphone or anything that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410624">
        makes him stand out .He does not need to defeat anybody he just want to be rich and he will use anybody for his wishes and it is really entertaining to see him work his ass off.<br />
The rest of the cast is also great the lizard guy looks a lot like mc from dorohedoro <br />
The animation style feels somewhat unique, the voice actors and the soundtracks are also done decently.<br />
I think a lot of people still are still sleeping on this.<br />
Watch the first episode it only gets better from there

    YELP, an Isekai about the pangs of working at a Black Company!? Come save me Work Jesus, for the glory of capitalism!<br />
<br />
We&#039;ve seen shows present this topic before, most particularly and recently with Akane Shimizu&#039;s Hataraku Saibou BLACK a.k.a Cells at Work: Code Black, and it&#039;s what it is: the etymology of the term &quot;black company&quot; where it&#039;s typical practice to hire a large number of employees, exploit them to work large amounts of overtime without overtime pay with poor conditions, verbal abuse and &quot;power harassment&quot; (bullying) by their superiors, threatening them with disrepute if they chose to quit. And you can take all that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418060">
        and consummate into this series: Youhei Yasumura&#039;s Dungeon Black Company, which explains how to get your way through a Black Company and rise up the ranks. And the best part obout it, is that everything fits perfectly into the scenario played out.<br />
<br />
Yeah yeah, it&#039;s an Isekai first and foremost, but this is one of the few enjoyable Isekai of the Summer season that truly hits all the right spots of a &quot;rags to riches&quot; success story of a rollercoaster ride. And nowhere do we spot this than from the perspective of Kinji Ninomiya, voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi, the same person who brought you Jojo Part 5&#039;s Diavolo and Gurren Lagann&#039;s Kamiya (and man, his voice absolutely fits the cunning, manipulative of a confident scumbag himself). If you&#039;ve watched last season&#039;s Sentouin, Hakenshimasu!, both MCs Combatant Agent No. 6 and Kinji are very similar to one another: they play dirty with their &quot;bad guy&quot; despicable mindset, deal with their own evil organization with ulterior motives and manifesting similar comedy vibes (though I feel that Black Company does it better), and to top it up, they have loli partners/supports as well. The &quot;riches to rags to riches&quot; story that sees the NEET Ninomiya being Isekai-ed into a fantasy world where he has to start his work dominance over from scratch, and that&#039;s a pain right there. Along with the relentless obfuscating lesson of hard work and fellow workers that toll with him, it&#039;s a pain in the butt to having be overworked again by word from negligent superiors, and that&#039;s where Kinji got the single-best idea of all: to create his own Dungeon Black Company from within and slowly create a coup d&#039;etat as his calvary charge of retaliation.<br />
<br />
But in order to create his own organization, Kinji&#039;s first strategy is just as important as the series&#039; core progression: its cast of characters whom are comrades also fighting for the same poverty rights. The first worker that Kinji recruits is this crocodilian demi-human named Wanibe, who was his co-worker at the start of the series. And boy, these 2 bore the entirety of the starting phase of revolt against the Raiza&#039;ha Corporation, which are doing the same thing that Ninomiya once did in his old, accomplished NEET life. From there, the dungeon opens its doors, and slowly but surely, both him and Wanibe hit it off to encounter monsters and fellow workers whom are suffering the same overworked circumstances, fight and recruit them to their side  (like a dungeon for easy proposition to start the topple rumbling from within. The 3rd character of Kinji&#039;s crusade is arguably one of the most important characters, and is what helps and gives him trouble at the same time: the dragon girl that is Rim. As you would expect, Rim does act like the usual titular dungeon boss character, but you know Kinji, his cunning manipulation got the best of her, and she shapeshifted into a teenage loli just so that she can have meat, regardless of Kinji&#039;s finanical status. Rim does act on accord because she was the former Demon Lord of the Dungeon, but she got too lazy and bored, and handed the reins over to someone else just so that she could wander free on her own whim. Couple in the dubbed failure of a hero that is Shia and the magic tomboy that is Ranga, and these 5 people form the basis of Kinji&#039;s unusual adventurer party of the Dungeon Black Company, pushing their way through to the top and achieve Nirvana on Kinji&#039;s ultimate goal: to rule over others without having to work his butt. If you ask me, this is a sweet deal of a package that I&#039;m willing to buy, because while the characters aren&#039;t as unique, but they&#039;re at the very least entertaining and funny to see their antics spread across the many layers of numerous battles both physically and mentally. It never gets old and stale, and in an Isekai of this calibre where I can sympathize with their sufferings, truly does an equivocal effect of using your brain to work smart, and not work hard.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a fun Isekai show for sure, and what better way to top it off with the VAs which complement the characters so darn freaking well. Rim is voiced by Misaki Kuno, who has been the face of Nanatsu no Taizai&#039;s favorite talking pig Hawk, and seen as such, Rim is such a comical character who just doesn&#039;t care and gets what she wants by hook or by crook. Hiro Shimono acting as Wanibe with his voice being a veteran mainstay, and it&#039;s of no surprise at all. Everyone&#039;s favourite VA M.A.O voicing Ranga, and I swear if that&#039;s not the same voice that I heard with Tensei Slime&#039;s Shion, then she must&#039;ve got a vocal upgrade. Rounding up the rag-tag crew is Megumi Toda with Shia, and it&#039;s been awhile since New Game!&#039;s Hajime&#039;s voice was featured in an anime (alongside this season&#039;s Peach Boy Riverside&#039;s Meki a.k.a Carrot). The manga may be nothing, but the anime helped elevate the manga by a notch with such stellar VA performances.<br />
<br />
Likewise, Silver Link&#039;s generic Isekai production substrates have remained the same for a few years now, but to do some experiments with this show is a nice touch that&#039;s coming from in-house director Mirai Minato. But it&#039;s just the same that I don&#039;t really expect much of it anymore, and if it is produced decently, then that&#039;s all we need. The music though, if I were to compare the OST as a whole in this season, it&#039;s the sleeper kind of &quot;it&#039;s pure unadulterated goodness&quot;. I&#039;ve come to love both the OP and ED overtime that fits the tone of the show, but more particularly with the ED, because Humbreaders came back strong with their 2nd featured Anisong that is an upgrade when compared to Shin! Chuuka Ichiban S2&#039;s ED, and both songs evoke the sense of youth overflowing with fun.<br />
<br />
For those tired with the usual Isekai genericness that we got over the past few years, please, PLEASE, try out Dungeon Black Company. IMO it&#039;s way lot grounded and better than Sentouin, Hakenshimasu!, and it&#039;s the same crazed idiocy with the likes of KonoSuba&#039;s Kazuma if he were ever to get stuck in jobs that would have him procrastinating and whining every second without end. It&#039;s a strange, yet fascinating Isekai world, and I would not have it in any other way for the time investment of interests well spent, from being lost in the red to profiting much in the green.

    This Is hands down one of the best isekai this season for me, the other being moonlit fantasy , and by my reviews you can tell I watched each one of them .<br />
<br />
Meikyuu black company , a very subpar manga which I had heard about a year ago . When the anime was announced I had little to no exceptions but since slime came out this season , I joined that bandwagon, the point is This is the hidden gem this season without a doubt.<br />
<br />
THough it had an interesting setting , The manga had failed to bring life to the characters so I was worried

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410615">
        that the anime would just be similar or a bit better .<br />
<br />
I underestimated the power of VAs<br />
<br />
The VA s in this anime have done the most perfect job , a lizardman who is big and strong but lacks the confidence or the spine to even hurt a fly, A cocky MC who finds ways to make a quick buck and is lazy but isn&#039;t afraid to hustle to a successful future , A loli monster i repeat .. lol...small … monster. The examples are endless, the sound and feel exactly as they should . It&#039;s perfect for an otherwise average story, the plot isn&#039;t very weak but for the karoshi(worked to death)  ridden japan it is a very serious topic and the MC is the example of work smart not hard And there&#039;s a lot one can learn from that .This is a comedy anime before an isekai and it does its job well that&#039;s all you need to know.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the stats so far<br />
<br />
Art and animation: 8/10 <br />
 Original monsters and great looking characters who don&#039;t seem to be a carbon copy , the setting is an urbanized isekai with demons and beastfolk and it looks perfect (A hardhat goblin really is some level of social commentary now, eh? xD) .<br />
<br />
Plot and characters: 8/10<br />
Very original story No kirito clone nice guy with a harem , A strong practical and optimistic protagonist who isn&#039;t afraid to push to the limits to get what he wants and that is very likable ,The lizard dude may sound odd at first but later on You realize it fits his personality perfectly.<br />
<br />
VA And sound (op ,ED): 10/10<br />
LOW BUDGET But heaven whoever did the hiring of VAs needs a raise , this person has done a fantastic job of gathering the best suited (even if not famous )<br />
 VAs for the anime , The ED is my favorite Ed of the season and I love the animation in it too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Isekai fan or not everyone needs to give this a try whether get reinspired and stop being a Work animal and learn to think and fend for themselves once more or just for a fun ride.<br />
<br />
<br />

    Finally, we got an isekai that doesn’t treat its viewers as a bunch of horny degenerates, pedophile fetishists, or people who think that good animation is enough to call something a masterpiece. More surprisingly, it’s a comedy show from a person who knows what a good comedy is.<br />
<br />
First and foremost, Meikyuu Black Company is a satire. A satire about all of the Japanese corporative culture, hell working conditions, workers’ servility, and chiefs who treats their subordinates as a useless piece of shit – all in a form of 12-eps isekai anime. Yeah, MBC world is not your typical pseudo-European medieval fantasy – it is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418061">
        hybrid of dungeon crawling and evil capitalist corporations. This idea is realized well done and provides us a bunch of good jokes about itself. The standard anime humor (like SRPG parody, some fanservice, or nonsensical stuff) is also here and there and nicely complemented a lot of well-done satire about capitalism.<br />
<br />
The protagonist is hilarious. At first impression, he acts like a cowardly scum who thinks that all other people as the lowest forms of life and deserves nothing but hate and contempt. However, as the story progresses, Ninomiya-kun (a.k.a evil, grown-up, and less horny version of Kazuma) becomes more and more appealing. He is not OP and weak (our mc can’t even use magic because he doesn’t belong to this world) and have an enormous debt, so the only way to survive for him is to use his brain and evil charisma. And yeah, it works – Kinji’s attempts to rise from rock bottom to corporation elite are the thing that makes this show so unique. <br />
<br />
Other characters (his party and enemies) are also well-done and have some moments to shine, but mostly just nothing more but standard archetypes (non-human loli who likes to eat a lot? fanservice knight with big breasts? demon generals? how many times we saw it before?). However, it doesn’t make Meikyuu Black Company worse, because these characters are still funny, still enjoyable to watch, and still much better than generic isekai waifus 1-6 who have no differences instead of hair color. Yeah, this show is not your typical harem – because it isn’t a harem at all.<br />
<br />
The animation is fine, nothing more to say. Silver Link is famous for their cheap 12-ep light novel advertisements, and MBC isn’t much better – just a solid middle level, nothing epic, and nothing special. <br />
<br />
Of course, Meikyuu Black Company is not a masterpiece or a new isekai standard. It’s nothing more than a funny comedy with a pretty cool concept, great protagonist, and likable visual style, but I expected nothing and enjoyed this show. I recommend it even if you are an isekai hater because MBC isn’t similar to your typical alternative world anime a.k.a “I was a loser in my previous life, but became an OP magician and all bitches love me now” stuff. Long Live Black Company!

    Kamina is the protagonist. If that isn&#039;t enough to get you to watch this then I don&#039;t know what is. After god knows how many Isekai shows with a spineless doormat loser, or a nice guy self-insert genius messiah who brings such great innovations like basic technology and irrigation to Isekailand, it is just so utterly refreshing to see someone this charismatic take the helm of an Isekai.<br />
<br />
And it&#039;s not just that it&#039;s an Isekai. Meikyuu Black Company deviates so much from the standard formula, setting, and even style that to call it a typical Isekai would be a great disservice. The show is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418065">
        comedy, but it cycles through a gamut of different genres including corporate hell, business management, corporate training, post-apocalypse, that one TTGL dream sequence episode, and even a typical Isekai episode for exactly one episode. The whole show being set in a pre-smartphone post-industrial fantasy setting is certainly novel, and my God it is just so refreshing to see Isekai denizens just acting like normal people and not braindead idiots who can&#039;t figure out basic technology or are stuck in a medieval stasis. <br />
<br />
But really, the true star of the show is the MC, Ninomiya. He is basically Kamina in every aspect from his voice, his attitude, and even his hair. He is incredibly charismatic but not entirely infallible. Part of MBC&#039;s success is that it doles out moments of triumphs and failure to Ninomiya at a perfect pace so that he never truly succeeds in any given venture/scam but is always ready to bounce back with another crazy scheme that will once again invariably blow up in his face, sometimes for really mundane and realistic reasons (like getting busted by the company&#039;s Health Inspection for lacing lousy potions with confusion grass). He is a complete jackass with no redeeming factors, and I do love how the show sets up a bait-and-switch that almost makes you think they&#039;re gonna do the thing where he&#039;s not really a jerk and is really looking out for his friends or whatever. And that is just the best. You root for him to succeed AND fail in his mad schemes at the same time, and that really makes you bond with the character so much more.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast also fare incredibly well too, being great foils to Ninomiya&#039;s personality in many different ways. I do think Sky and Rim (hah) are lacking in terms of character, especially in their spotlight episode, but for what it&#039;s worth they are cute and don&#039;t interfere too much with the overall show.<br />
<br />
The comedy is fantastic. A lot of it is very work-related humor with a good balance of fantasy humor, but taken to the extreme. It&#039;s largely based on what would happen if you have an exploitative conglomerate operating in Isekailand. The show has a really high rate of dishing out jokes, and there are plenty of moments that just caught me completely off guard that I had to pause the video just to get ahold of myself.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a great thing this airs on Fridays. Making the show a perfect sendoff to the week (and a perfect show to counter the absolute depression of Uramichi Oniisan). MBC is what I watch to bring me back from the brink at the end of every week, and I will miss the show dearly as neverending work continues in the real world...<br />
<br />

    Alright im gonna keep this short but to whoever that read this, don&#039;t trust the mediocre score cause this show is good af.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start about the character,The MC,he&#039;s a NEET but not a lowly NEET like all previous isekai,he&#039;s a rich and cool NEET that already achieve everything that he needs in life,but when he&#039;s on top suddenly somehow he&#039;s get sucked by a black portal that send him to a place where he is nothing but a corporate slave without no cheat,no extra power and the only think he brought from his previous life is his economic knowledge.Now if that&#039;s wasn&#039;t interesting,then i don&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410867">
        know what.<br />
<br />
The art is superb and the animation is on point.<br />
<br />
Any character beside the MC is quite decent, especially the lizard guy and Rimu since she&#039;s cute<br />
<br />
The op is lit, i would definitely never skip it<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall im really enjoying this show so far,hope my enjoyment can last till the last episode.<br />
<br />
9/10

    Do you think the concept of isekai isn&#039;t inherently bad but the cheap, mass produced, cardboard cut-out formula it became ruins it entirely? Well allow me to present something different™.<br />
<br />
Dungeon of Black Company is isekai done right. We follow Ninomiya Kinji, a shut-in NEET (wait, wait, don&#039;t click off) who got everything he could ever want and used the rules of our world to his advantage to become filthy rich. I don&#039;t need to do anything anymore kind of rich.<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s take someone who got everything, and take it all from him, transporting him in a fantasy world at the beginning of the industrial era.<br />
<br />
This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418137">
        concept isn&#039;t too far-fetched and yet stays fresh enough to get you interested. After all, the same old medieval fantasy world can only last so long before it gets stale.<br />
<br />
In this world in industrial expansion where human rights haven&#039;t been invented yet, the chances to get promoted are rather slim, and this is where our protagonist will show off his skill.<br />
<br />
After all, physical power, while flashy, is still an overused aspect of not only isekai, or anime, but entertainment as a whole. Instead, Ninomiya&#039;s main aspect is his lack of morals, matching that of the company itself, and his ability to find the good people and use them to the best of his abilities, which is a new kind of overpowered, making it feel rather nice.<br />
<br />
Enough praises about Ninomiya, even though he&#039;s a king beyond what the human mind can appreciate. What about the rest? Is it the same old dead and beaten harem with a bunch of hot girls head over heels for him for no apparent reason?<br />
<br />
No, Ninomiya is an asshole, remember? Well there is one who gets the uwu blushy wushy kinda thing, but it doesn&#039;t go any further. And to make up for it, there&#039;s a based ant waifu, and Wanibe, who&#039;s also really solid.<br />
<br />
And it is actually an isekai where the side characters can be summarized with more than a single sentence, to its credit, not many put that kind of effort.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Ninomiya, despite being a main character, may not even be overpowered. After all, he spent a large portion of these 12 episodes struggling against the much superior Raiza&#039;ha, and has been put in some bad situations, even failed a few time. How many isekai protagonists have failed in the runtime of their anime? That&#039;s what I thought.<br />
<br />
If there was one thing I&#039;d bash this anime for, it would be Rim&#039;s... everything. No hate on her design, just like everyone else, she looks unique, but it&#039;s still palatable. The problem is that... well, she appears in episode 1, she&#039;s overpowered and she never openly opposes Ninomiya, which makes her the substitute for an overpowered main character, and makes Ninomiya&#039;s challenge a lot easier than what it could have been. All in all, she&#039;s more of a lazy plot device than a character, and it is a bit sad.<br />
<br />
But still, this anime isn&#039;t any less of a crazy ride, and is probably one of, if not my favorite anime of the season

    Some say, you wouldn&#039;t want to be Isekai&#039;d into Re:zero. Well, you wouldn&#039;t want to be Isekai&#039;d into this universe either. Sure, for less dangers, but still dangers non the less. It&#039;s part of this shows charm, and it really puts an interesting twist on the Isekai trope. Imagine instead of being the hero, or just getting a better life, you&#039;re instead sucked from your set for life riches, to basically start it all over again from scratch. This is Meikyuu Black Company.<br />
<br />
Story and characters.<br />
Both of these fit together, as it&#039;s part of the characters personalities that really push it. Even if most of them

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410617">
        seem this corporate scumbag look down upon most ruthless persona, while some others are actually more tame, or least just want out of this hell hole. A wide mix of characters that really set the tone of the story, and ow hard life can be on you.<br />
<br />
Imagine a fantasy dungeon, filled with monsters, rare items, gems, the works. Now imagine you&#039;re forced to work there, for non stop, for so many hours like a dead end job. It&#039;s what the term Black Company is all about after all. A ruthless working environment. But long as the company makes money and profit, ten that&#039;s all that matters. As for how the story is fleshed out, there are some rater comedic moments at times, you either don&#039;t want to cheer for the main MC, or just hope he gets a smack for his ideals at times. His companion in this, Wanibe, is actually one that you can root for, and wish for the best. While Rimu is just a precious monster, though, wouldn&#039;t want to cross her.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a fun happy Isekai, that you go on an adventure with, then this isn&#039;t it. While it&#039;s still a good watch of course, but it comes across as if Kazuma from Konosuba was stuck in a ruthless dead end job, and tries everything to get out of it. It&#039;s that kind of fun Iseaki, and it&#039;s really something.<br />
<br />
Art and sound.<br />
The art style can really be great at times, while it&#039;s normal style does look very normal, and the animation isn&#039;t bad at all. But there are some moments where it really stands out. Like how they make the gems glow, and continue to glow throughout. I may be biased towards shiny things, but hey, it looks good. While the sound is fit for purpose as always.<br />
<br />
Meikyuu Black Company is a strange one, but one that does keep me interested week to week. I&#039;d advise giving it a shot honestly!

    Before I started this anime, I thought it was gonna be just another show to watch and get over with. When I started watching it, I liked the different approach to the isekai genre. I thought that was just it. The first few episodes didn&#039;t catch my attention that much, but I kept watching.<br />
<br />
The anime delivered some good surprises mid way. That&#039;s where I felt the anime really kick off. At first, it was the story of a man vs an entire greedy conglomerate, and the outlook looked simple at first. However, the author of the manga really knows how to spice up the story,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420069">
        and the producers did a phenomenal job in adapting it.<br />
<br />
With each new episode, I grew to love this show even more. At first, I was deciding between giving it a 7/10 or 8/10, but by the time I finished the last episode, I gave it a rating of 10/10. The last episode this season was so emotional, and if a second season came by, the nostalgia would show itself then.<br />
<br />
To me, it seems like the show grows along with the MC; at first, Ninomiya is just another person trying to get back on his feet, so to speak, after he gets isekai&#039;d. However, with each passing episode, Ninomiya shows true talent and hard work *ahem *cough cough), which makes not only him grow as a character, but all those around him.<br />
<br />
Really looking forward to a second season for this one.

    Without getting into specifics, the show doesn&#039;t really focus on anything as far as the business ventures, it just kinda mentions he&#039;s in debt, shows some way he&#039;s gonna make money without really exploring it much, then just saying he sold the stuff and payed off the debt, without showing the sales process or anything.<br />
<br />
The show just feels very shallow, most of the character&#039;s ideas aren&#039;t very novel to begin with, it&#039;s usually something that makes you say &quot;Really, no ones thought of that in this world before?&quot; and then you just accept it and move on to the next thing. People have said he&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417039">
        not overpowered, but at the same time he gets overpowered companions and randomly finds special secrets and shit, so he may as well be. He doesn&#039;t generally succeed because he&#039;s very clever or charismatic, and when he does try it fails and he needs the overpowered character to save his ass anyway.<br />
<br />
The shows not really funny, it sometimes devolves into a weird ecchi, it&#039;s not an action show, and as I&#039;ve said it doesn&#039;t go deep into management or economics or anything, it&#039;s just kind of random shit happening for the most part. The only real consistent line is complaining about the big evil corporation. I didn&#039;t hate the show, it wasn&#039;t painful to sit through for the most part, it just wasn&#039;t that good. The dead cow episode was pretty good though, and the last few episodes do get better, the ending is where the character&#039;s ideas actually get interesting so if they make a second season I&#039;ll probably give it a chance.

    The isekai genre is pretty much unanimously notorious—notorious for mass-producing wholly lifeless shows that are barred from any semblance of creativity whatsoever. A large part of the anime viewers look down upon the genre for this reason, but despite its notoriety, the popularity of isekai is still as high as ever. More than half a dozen isekai shows are shoved down our throat nearly every season, and the ongoing summer isn&#039;t an exception to that. Meikyuu Black Company is not much different from your typical isekai anime in this regard, but surprisingly, it&#039;s one of the very few ones out there that barely suffer because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418066">
        of that.<br />
<br />
When people think of a comedy isekai, parodies like KonoSuba usually come to mind because of their overblown popularity over the recent years. Surprisingly though, Meikyuu isn&#039;t really an isekai parody. It&#039;s primarily a typical (&quot;typical&quot; in the sense that it&#039;s not isekai) comedy anime that provides a rather interesting and satirical take on capitalism. However, although Meikyuu isn&#039;t necessarily a parody of isekai, it&#039;s indeed aware of the genre&#039;s trappings and sometimes cleverly uses them for comedic purpose, which already makes the series a breath of fresh air.<br />
<br />
Coming back to the pivotal theme of the series, Meikyuu satirizes the capital mindset in rather bizarre and exaggerated ways, but in doing so, it also provides a serious and well-written critique of the system. Of course, the portrayal of capitalism here isn&#039;t what you would call solemn and akin to reality, but there&#039;s always an underlying sense of truth that remains behind the seemingly light-hearted comedy. I don&#039;t mean that Meikyuu is a serious show by any measure, but when it does try to be profound (somewhat), it surprisingly succeeds to a great extent. And the person who makes it all work is the protagonist, Kinji Ninomiya.<br />
<br />
Ninomiya is by far the most intriguing character in the anime; he is arguably the very thing that makes Meikyuu so entertaining and sets it apart from other isekai series. What makes Ninomiya himself so entertaining is his severe contrast with the multitude of isekai protagonists out there. Ninomiya can be quite dumb, selfish, cynical and manipulative at times, but he is also unexpectedly clever and thoughtful. His actions and beliefs are undoubtedly questionable sometimes, but they never affect the likeability of his character (other than the time he grabbed Shia&#039;s chest for no logical reason).<br />
<br />
To be more specific, Ninomiya&#039;s unwillingness to give in to his shitty circumstances is what makes him compelling. There have been several times in the anime where Ninomiya was driven to a corner, but he has always managed to get on top of the situation with the help of his insane ideas. Luck hasn&#039;t exactly been on his side since he was isekaied to another world, and it doesn&#039;t seem like it will be anytime soon either, but one&#039;s thing for sure—Ninomiya will continue to fight against his predicaments no matter what it takes; he is never going to give up. And again, that is precisely what makes him such a compelling character.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, in a way, that also makes Ninomiya the biggest weakness of Meikyuu—I will explain how.<br />
<br />
Ninomiya is clearly the singular main character of the story, and while that&#039;s not necessarily a bad thing in of itself, the anime occasionally relies on him so much to the point that other characters feel like tools simply made for the story to progress. Even when someone else does gain the spotlight, they don&#039;t manage to hold much impression to be honest, because it doesn&#039;t take long before they get reduced to a background character again.<br />
<br />
Despite these glaring issues, though, the characters never fail to be entertaining. Wanibe is a very likeable guy despite his naive personality, Shia is an encouraging women with her brave and resolute nature, and Renga is rather adorable although his depiction in the anime is questionable at times (especially that bath scene). Of course, there&#039;s Rim as well, whose insatiable hunger and childish behavior creates some genuinely hilarious moments in the anime. All in all, Rim is generally a very likeable and entertaining character—if we discount her clothing issues. I mean, surely it wouldn&#039;t hurt anyone if you didn&#039;t make her a loli or, you know, at least gave her some proper clothes.<br />
<br />
The pacing can also be off at times. Sometimes, the story moves forward in an abruptly fast pace and escalates way too quickly for its own good. The final arc of the show is the best example of this; I found the last two episodes a bit difficult to follow because of the sudden progression of the events. That arc felt kinda rushed for the most part to be honest, although I did enjoy it in the end.<br />
<br />
In terms of production, there honestly isn&#039;t much to talk about Meikyuu. Don&#039;t get me wrong, though—it&#039;s not a badly produced anime by any means. The animation is pretty decent and the soundtrack isn&#039;t half bad either. The opening song seriously slaps by the way. It&#039;s one of the catchiest theme songs this season (or even this entire year) and by far the most underrated one. The ending song is also quite good.<br />
<br />
Despite my initial qualms, Meikyuu Black Company ultimately proved to be a simple yet nonetheless enjoyable isekai anime. It doesn&#039;t bring anything particularly new or revolutionary to the table per se, but if what you want is simply an isekai anime that doesn&#039;t cover itself with superfluous drama and actually tries to make its audience laugh, then this show won&#039;t disappoint you. Especially in a time period where isekai has become almost entirely devoid of flair, Meikyuu is, without a doubt, more than a welcome addition to the genre.

    *spoilers duh<br />
<br />
Meikyuu Black Company is what you get as a result of mixing the corporate mess of a world we live in nowadays (in certain parts of the world, at least) multiplied by at least 3 with a tingle of overdone isekai clichés.<br />
<br />
The experience watching the show itself is no different from the dry description above.<br />
<br />
The story begins with the main character who until that point (seemed to) have lead a comfortable life being plunged into a fantasy one, but with zero capital. At least in the game of &quot;real life&quot;, you generally start off with something, assuming your parents were competent. Over the course

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418195">
        of the show, Ninomiya gets downgraded to a statement in the form of a character - &quot;if there is scum above you, the best way to beat them is by being even scummier and cheating your way to the top&quot;. Of course, there is always the option of simply leaving, but considering his situation, that may have been out of question.<br />
He&#039;s the type of person to ruthlessly take advantage of the companions he makes along the way, initially willing to cast them away if necessary. Whether he develops strong bonds with them in the latter part of the story remains unclear, because he simply doesn&#039;t get put into situations of that nature anymore as far as the anime is concerned.<br />
One of the later decisions he makes seems to dispel what I&#039;ve just said to a certain extent, but presumably, he wasn&#039;t driven by compassion, but by a sense of challenge to beat the system he ended up enslaved by. I gotta give it to him that &quot;spite&quot; wasn&#039;t what fueled most of his actions though.<br />
<br />
As a character his value solely lies in the message the author tries to convey via him. For someone with a noisy dumbass idealistic personality, he&#039;s surprisingly shrewd and cunning (in his plans) and his companions regard him as a strong, worthy leader. I generally don&#039;t demand realism, especially not from a show with such a setting, but gaining followers with that sort of nature would simply be too implausible, unless his followers were devoid of personality, aspirations and thought ---- which actually seems to be the case<br />
<br />
To summarize <br />
Wanibe - being befriended by Ninomiya for not joining the workers union. Doesn&#039;t mind being used merely as an underling. He&#039;s a decent person. That about sums him up, sadge.<br />
Rimu - do I even need to say anything? She has a big appetite. The most creative personality trait you&#039;re getting out of this show.<br />
Shia - a bootlicker with a strong sense of duty. Her personality does change throughout the show in terms of becoming less shallow - over the span of a single or two episodes. The outline remains the same, but her demeanor just leaves a bigger sense of thoughtfulness than a workaholic maniac. Though, can&#039;t say I wouldn&#039;t be in love with my job either if it consisted of me being op &amp; slaying boss monsters. No real character development for her apart from receiving a reality check thanks to getting exposed to Ninomiya&#039;s nature.<br />
Ranga - another puppy to the collection. Props for it being an 男の娘 tho. Much like Rimu, he&#039;s only accompanying Ninomiya due to the quirky adventures he gets himself into. There&#039;s not much to say about him either.<br />
<br />
So he gets himself a collection of mostly powerful individuals who lack a plan in their life. How convenient. Again I know realism is not the point of the show by any stretch of the imagination, but if you&#039;re trying to send a message, at least do it properly. Perhaps I&#039;m supposed to read into the show viewing it as a parody of one of these capitalism-themed underdog stories, but that&#039;s not the impression I get here. Or perhaps it&#039;s purpose is to be just dumb fun, which I&#039;d be fine with if it didn&#039;t tackle a prevalent topic in society. Just to remind you, overwork and corporate culture is just *a tad bit* bigger deal in Japan than it is in the West (altho we&#039;re sadly catching up). <br />
Perhaps a part of me was expecting some criticism of the system - and no, displaying the ones participating it as wretched individuals is not nearly enough, considering how the show otherwise embraces that reality with open arms.<br />
<br />
So what other value does the show bring to the table aside from being disappointing in several ways? <br />
Petition to make &quot;intrudicing heavy topics and refusing to elaborate&quot; a genre of its own btw. A shorter episode count would be preferred for that type of work though.<br />
<br />
The only other remaining value the show has is its sense of scope, which nowadays sadly means very little, considering how many shows do a better job with a better fleshed out world, but nonetheless - seeing Ninomiya and his team reach the top, despite all the adversities they had to face---<br />
Actually scratch that too, the show becomes way too lenient on them in the latter half. Only the first half of the show appears to be an actual struggle for them, constantly getting screwed over. Him making his allies are some of the most entertaining moments in the show and the sole reason this isn&#039;t a 3/10 - in fact just consider my score a 3.5/10<br />
<br />
That reminds me, I should probably say something about the humor to wrap this up. It usually comes in two flavours:<br />
- Ninomiya makes a completely insane proposal and everyone&#039;s appalled. Veri fani.<br />
- Rimu or someone else does something stupid and Ninomiya is shocc. Veri fani again.<br />
There are some moments that don&#039;t fit into these categories and even got a chuckle or two out of me, but by far not enough for me to recommend it as a comedy.<br />
<br />
Thanks for coming to my Ted talk

    This anime fucking broke me. I watch a lot of pretty bad isekai anime and this one, while a bit different on surface is nothing but the same tropey, wish fulfilment bs most isekai anime is turned to 11, with a heaping dash of Randian objectivism for some reason.<br />
<br />
The characters are all boring or bumbling idiots. The MC is a perfect entrepreneur that always manages to get rich, no matter what situation he is. His friends are a pushover lizard, a hungry hungry dragon thing that only ever eats or beats up everything that gets in MCs way, and the corporate weirdo. I am sure

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415391">
        others get added into that very diverse and interesting cast but this thing broke me half way through.<br />
<br />
Everyone else that isn&#039;t the MC or his friends is shown as a bumbling lazy moron, the person who wrote this basically just ripped off Atlas Shrugged and added magic and animal people.<br />
<br />
This show broke me when a clearly underage character was being photographed naked by a very adult man.<br />
<br />
This show is the actual embodiment of &quot;Anime was a mistake&quot;<br />
<br />
The opening song is kinda good tho, and the animation is fine, I guess I will give them that.

    --NO MAJOR SPOILERS--<br />
<br />
Meikyuu Black Company is a hard show to exactly rank. Despite falling into some typical isekai pitfalls and execution of tropes, it stands out at as a rather fresh show nonetheless. The show satirizes terrible working conditions and problems of a capitalistic system to such an extreme level, it both gives great commentary on it, while being surreal and wacky enough to be genuinely funny. One ep we’re having the mc blackmail the main hero of the company abusing their employees to work on him, the next we’re having him sucked into the far future only to have to back in time to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418064">
        stop said evil company from causing an oppressive mecha force to cause the already post-apocalyptic world to go into even worse turmoil. No I couldn’t make that up if even if I wanted too.<br />
<br />
--STORY—<br />
MBC’s story is honestly hard to describe. There is an overall end goal here with pretty blatant themes, but it gets there in the most unpredictable and weird way. At times it feels like they’re mashing just a ton of crap together, and yet it honestly works. I would say the main cycle is Ninomiya becoming successful with some get rich quick scheme, only for it to inevitably fall apart, but even that doesn’t really properly do it justice. I wouldn’t exactly call MBC a twist heavy show, but it will probably surprise in you in the direction it goes. The comedy is good overall, and while some jokes are again typical isekai/anime humor, there’s also a lot of funny and well done jokes too.<br />
<br />
--CHARACTERS—<br />
<br />
Probably the main highlight of this show for me is Ninomiya overall. He starts off as a scumbag and more or less is still one by the end, but he does show some great growth. He does genuinely care for his allies, will go out of his way to solve problems, and even eventually incorporates ethical and fair working conditions. I would say he’s still ultimately a self-centered person and often he has some ulterior motive to helping others and usually manipulates them, but there’s a few times where he could’ve taken the easy way out and didn’t and that’s pretty respectable. Regardless of how shady or selfish his motives and methods can be, he’s absolutely the most hard working and determined NEET you’ll meet and it makes for a good dynamic. He gets more than his fair share of punishment for being a douche at times, so when he is finally rewarded and in a better position it feels more or less earned compared to a lot of isekai protags. <br />
<br />
Side cast is fairly typical isekai stuff, but they work well enough. Belza and her company from Hell works well enough as an antag too, but don’t expect anything crazy. <br />
<br />
--ART/ANIMATION—<br />
<br />
Animation is pretty consistently good, I didn’t really notice any eps that were badly animated. There’s not too much cgi, and when there is it doesn’t really feel distracting or out of place. Ninomiya has a good design, but sometimes the girls felt like they fell into “sameface” a bit. Mostly the eyes and lips would often seem really similar. I would like to point out the 2nd ED is very cute and well animated for being 3D.<br />
<br />
--SOUND—<br />
<br />
Voice cast is quite nice, Katsuyuki Konishi does a great job having a near comically evil voice for Ninomiya, and you love to hear him do his performance. Misaki Kuno’s performance as Rimu is also very cute and funny, she voices all her antics quite well. The rest of the cast is good too.<br />
<br />
Music is actually pretty consistently catchy. The OP and ED in particular are very good, and the general soundtrack has some good metal, atmospheric, and chill music overall. <br />
<br />
--ENJOYMENT/CONCLUSION—<br />
<br />
7.5/10 show overall. Definitely one of the fresher isekai to come out, and I’d rec it if you’re looking for something a bit different in the genre. I enjoyed it quite a bit, and wouldn’t mind watching a sequel season to it. Here’s hoping we get more creative isekai like this in the future.<br />

    To be honest, I&#039;m very happy that there is some original isekai anime like this show because it is getting boring to see similar plot Isekai anime.<br />
<br />
First of all what is most outstanding is humour and extraordinary way to tackle problems the same way would Kazuma from Konosuba deal with these things. The humour actually similar to Konosuba and Gintama for this reason I really love this show. Extraordinary story, unpredictable choices of the character which are really funny since there are a lot of similar problems we can relate to our real life.<br />
<br />
THis show isn&#039;t about some &quot;extraordinary art&quot;, &quot;amazing battles&quot;, &quot;music&quot;. This show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review413300">
        has a great original story which is funny and amazing for this reason it creates a good entertainment for viewers. Please, try it and you will have a blast.

    If I were to evaluate this anime in few words then it would be &quot;an anime with a lot of ups and downs&quot;.<br />
I think that encapsulates my thoughts perfectly.<br />
<br />
The story is decent. It&#039;s an isekai which parodies the current state of black companies in Japan. And I think that it works quite well as a show. Although there&#039;s a lot of ridiculous and unnecessary plot twists and threads being introduced, it doesn&#039;t really break the audience immersion unless they think about it.<br />
<br />
The characters have their own charm which makes up for the lack of development. Even though most of the cast are one-dimensional characters, they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418071">
        aren&#039;t uninteresting by any means. That doesn&#039;t mean they are good characters though as they are incredibly forgettable.<br />
<br />
The animation is acceptable. It does have a lot of jarring movements and lots of off-models, but it does have some good art sprinkled here and there as still images.<br />
<br />
The music is good. It does have some catchy opening and ending. The ost is pretty lacking, but it doesn&#039;t really break any scenes whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s a really good anime and I recommend it.

    Intro<br />
Welcome to asshole company! If you&#039;re in the mood to watch assholes bicker and fight while flirting with your sense of debauchery and indecency... have a seat! I&#039;m sure we can find a perfect place for you here. As a company we will make you into a true, an authentic and all powerful grunt. Spread our message, display utterly inhumane working conditions and then laugh at the depression induced by real-life working conditions!<br />
<br />
Maybe not, I&#039;m not quite sure where this show lands in its philosophy to be honest. It seems to be less about what&#039;s right and wrong and more about just dipshitting its way

          <span style="display: none;" id="review413812">
        through a story about a guy who wants to get so fucking rich he can sleep and neet all of his life on the topfloor of a luxury apartment complex. It&#039;s kinda marvelous, sometimes underwhelming, but overall very entertaining. Just let go of any sense of logic or realism and revel in fan service and power fantasies alongside a good dose of capitalistic satire.<br />
<br />
Visual auditory experience<br />
As far as animation goes it&#039;s reliable and of pretty high quality. To anyone familiar with the style of Konosuba you&#039;ll be right at home here, you have some decently ugly and pretty faces and the bodies to go along with them. The music is pretty forgetable, but the overall voice acting and audio production is high quality. It&#039;s all at the level where you&#039;ll thoroughly enjoy the show if you&#039;re in line with the themes. But... but I did stop an episode once and it showed me some rather rough environmental details. That only speaks for one frame though, another time when I stopped the show it was a more detailed background image with clear details. Ultimately, that&#039;s not something I care too much about when I&#039;m watching the show so it doesn&#039;t affect my score much.<br />
<br />
Story &amp; Characters<br />
Mm... honestly, I don&#039;t have much energy left. But the characters int he show are entertaining, the only ones that have any real sense of originality are the main character and the human hero, both obsessed with their ideal working scenarios. The crew is somewhat quirky and intelligible, and the obligatory trap is in plain sight.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
Overall show is pretty good thus far, I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll linger in my memory for that long but it&#039;s definitely a solid time killer.

    Full motivation loaded. This anime delivers us the success we desire, even if we don&#039;t have one ! It is basically a fool&#039;s dream, turned out pretty miserable at first but mishap lags behind. Each moment of the animation is filled up with new idea as soon as the fall of past plans. Fairly sum of business artistry in isekai world. Largely it is expected, Isekai stories are full of harems and hero based  story, where the main character is about develop through out the events; that concept doesn&#039;t apply to this one. The main character Kinji Ninomiya is solid to his core as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421467">
        a character; doesn&#039;t change his philosophy and true to his motivation. The more episode you watch, the more you likely to enjoy.<br />
<br />
From a long time anime watcher perspective, animation style and quality is decent and it is the humor of the plot suits the art style better. For voice acting, production did magnificent choice for the cast; specially for Ninomiya. Music and sound is quit praiseworthy only if you pay attention to it [being honest].<br />
<br />
Plot for many isekai we have seen(those which are adopted) are written in a way, where protagonist is about to die or having unbalanced life and his fate changes with arriving in different world. Our hero Ninomiya is failed businessman who is having bad luck. With sudden luck in his life, he happens to become a rich. But, the transfer to new world takes away his good life; with this consequence the story buries other isekai plots of having miserable life in real world. Ninomiya after arriving in new world tries his best to return back to his world as the fate seals his good time away from him. As he stay longer in the new world, tries to adopt with new system and unveils many secret of the new world. New world has system of Dungeon, where major of oars and elements are used as source of income for big company stake holders. Ninomiya at first tries to join Veruza Spinach, who is the lady owns major dungeon and claims to be richest in the new world. Under her company, Ninomiya suffers as labor then tries to make his own company in disguise. Ninomiya promotes himself under Veruza&#039;s company as well as keep making his secret company stronger with allies like Wanibe the lizardman, Rimu the pink dragon and new partner from promotion Shia. To minimize casualties among labours, Ninomiya make the demons and creatures of dungeon under him through his brain work. In between these event Ninomiya travels to future and learns about disaster happens in future and portal that can make him go back to Japan. After returning from future travel, he comes with new ally Ranga, who is believed to be Veruza&#039;s future lineage. With further capturing massive part of dungeon, Ninomiya makes it to public about his company and with helps from creatures and their magic gains massive market in the new world. With increase in Ninomiya&#039;s growth, Veruza lost her market and stocks. Even with plans she tries to sue Ninomiya by blaming him for violating human rights by using creature in his business. Ninomiya hits back hard at her sue and wins the case; results in Veruza becomes his employee. With all the events, Ninomiya decides to make his business grow up to the whole world, where he owns all the dungeons from different part of the world. By the end our hero totally forgets about going back to join and becomes complete part of new world system. The company his made in dungeon is known as &quot;MEIKYU BLACK COMPANY&quot;.<br />
Good entertainment with good commercial and new teachings.

    “Another isekai? argh Skipped!” I can almost hear some of you thinking that, stop, this isn”t like the others. Here’s why.<br />
<br />
Devious, crafty and charismatic; funny, introspective and somewhat relatable. Kinji Ninomiya is the star of this show. Think Kazuma but with a more mature mentality - he’s not just a copy paste though, don’t be mistaken.<br />
<br />
The wide cast of characters were fun and lively, (They’ve got nearly all the types of waifus you want: mature, young but actually old, not even a girl...) but there isn’t a disgusting focus on it - it’s just there to be appreciated. <br />
<br />
SPOILERS <br />
There are many tonal shifts throughout

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418267">
        the anime but it never fails to maintain he freshness, quality and most importantly, sense. Meikyuu black company changed from exploitation of workers to time travel, and the depths of the dungeon to political schemes - all while being entertaining, fun and rather refreshing. <br />
END OF SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Sound and art was well done - nothing Fate/ Heaven’s Feel quality - but that’s that, this is this; the down to earthness fit the mood and atmosphere of the show well. <br />
<br />
This was a good watch and a definite stand out from the myriad isekai trash defiling our precious medium. Entertaining mc, simple but compelling plot, slight relatibilty if you work in a not so positive work environment. I wholeheartedly recommend this. 8.5/10!
