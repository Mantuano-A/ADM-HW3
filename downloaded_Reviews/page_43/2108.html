    &amp;ldquo;In happy times, one cocktail is enough, because anything you drink will taste good. But if there are a hundred shapes of unhappiness, I want to be a bartender who will make a hundred cocktails to soothe unhappiness.&amp;rdquo;<br />
<br />
An anime series about a bartender at work might not sound like anything worth paying attention to, but Bartender is a calm, gentle series that might be just what you need. Each episode covers the stories of customers that go into a bar to soothe their souls. Bartender Ryu Sasakura assists them with their problems by making them a cocktail with a history or taste that relates to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review788">
        the customer&amp;rsquo;s situation. By coming to terms with themselves through their drink, each customer can leave the bar satisfied. Each story is expanded upon not only by what the customer reveals but by narration, often by others that have also been healed by the bar. Each individual story is well-developed, detailed, and brought to a satisfying end. However, there is no plot carried across the full show.<br />
<br />
Much of the animation style is abstract, using many unrealistic background effects, quite a few of which are theatrical. For example, a character may be having a conversation at the bar counter, then the scene will cut to a narrator elaborating on what is happening, perhaps in a spotlight or even simply living their own lives. It may not seem realistic, but it&amp;rsquo;s pulled off quite well. While it may seem that it would be difficult or boring to follow a show narrated like this, it never is thanks to the animation that makes it clear what is happening in reality and what is abstract.<br />
<br />
While the background music doesn&amp;rsquo;t stand out in any particular situation, it also helps to create the atmosphere. The opening song provides a good introduction, and the ending is slow and simple, yet effective.<br />
<br />
The characters in each story are very believable. Instead of crazy characters made for the viewer&amp;rsquo;s excitement, they are developed to be believable people. In addition to each episodic character, the bartender himself is presented very well. Although at first he is the idealized &amp;ldquo;Glass of the Gods,&amp;rdquo; the man who can always make the perfect cocktail for a customer, his past is also addressed. By the end of the series, he has become a three-dimensional character with his own history and shortcomings.<br />
<br />
Bartender&amp;rsquo;s true strengths lie not in the technical aspects, but the atmosphere. It&amp;rsquo;s an incredibly relaxing show and does a great job doing exactly what the creators felt a bar should do: soothe the customers. Watching an episode is a great way to calm down after a bad day; you can sit back and enjoy without shutting down your brain. A word of warning, it&amp;rsquo;s not as enjoyable in large quantities, save it for when you need it.<br />
<br />
Bartender doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to be big or exciting, but instead appeals to people who want to relax while learning a little bit about alcohol and life. It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely little series that brings emotion and realism in a way that other, flashier shows can&amp;rsquo;t achieve.

    Children have no place in a bar, and most youths prefer dancing in nightclubs to loud music and cheap booze... but for those who wish a calmer and more mature place, there is the bar.<br />
Even among bars, there is a variety of styles: from seedy dockside dives, to beer halls where there is always a ball game or race being played on a large screen, to the dimly-lit classier cocktail bars...<br />
<br />
What, then, is a bar? A place where they serve drinks, sure, but that&#039;s just an element of the whole.<br />
A bar is a social environment safe from the rest of the world where one goes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review138955">
        to throw off the worries for a while; the drinks are just aids to relax and let go of tension and inhibitions. If it is a good bar, it&#039;s a place one regrets leaving even to go back home.<br />
<br />
In Bartender, we are welcomed with a warm smile to the Eden Hall, a small but cosy cocktail bar. The bartender himself is a confident and therapist to the regulars, well known for his near-magical ability to serve just the right drink to soothe each customer&#039;s soul from their problems. Go talk to him for a while, then ask him to surprise you - he&#039;ll deftly squeeze, blend, shake and mix the contents of a few bottles while sharing bits of trivia about the different ingredients.<br />
You might eventually realize that he&#039;s adding more than spirits into the cocktail, he&#039;s also mixing in tales, history, metaphors and emotions... that what he&#039;s making isn&#039;t simply a drink, but a customized healing potion to which the liquid in the glass is itself only a minor part.<br />
<br />
---<br />
Essence:<br />
<br />
Story &amp; direction: 9.<br />
Bartender is a niche experimental anime, episodic, and although the introduced characters become regulars and appear or even participate in subsequent episodes, in general each episode is dedicated to a patron and his problems.<br />
Instead of following a formal plot, it depends on realistically fleshed-out characters and an excellent direction using advanced techniques such as multilayer superimpositions, juxtapositions, camera angles, flashbacks, using characters as mouthpieces for a omniscient narrative, and seamlessly intermeshing the episode&#039;s theme with documentary elements. While the latter are fundamental for understanding the characters&#039; thought processes, they sometimes distract from the main theme, which is why I didn&#039;t give a full 10 to this section.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
As said before, the characters are realistic and well fleshed out. Sure, we mostly only see what they allow through the metaphorical public masks everybody uses or the tidbits we get from third parties, but isn&#039;t this also part of the realism?<br />
Even the bartender himself, who keeps his professional face throughout the series, gets a significant bit of his past explored by the regular patrons&#039; chatting and rumoring, bringing him down from the near-deity status his current abilities grant him and back to the human realm.<br />
The one time this realism was broken was when a character behaved irrationally in an emergency, for the sake of setting up the stage for an episode - but the outcome was so satisfactory that I&#039;m unwilling to penalize the series for it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
This is a hit-or-miss series that should be avoided by anybody who either dislikes bars or slow, talky shows; it also requires a modicum of maturity to enjoy properly. If this is not your case, avoid it altogether.<br />
Even then, as with alcoholic drinks, it should be taken with moderation. The best way to enjoy it is one or two episodes at a time, in a dimmed room, and with your favorite drink at hand.<br />
Cheers!<br />
<br />
---<br />
Existence:<br />
<br />
Art &amp; animation: 8<br />
The art is very good; the bar was created with loving detail, with shadows, reflections and detailed settings. The characters are competently drawn, with a wealth of adequately used facial expressions.<br />
There&#039;s not much happening throughout the episodes, most of the time it&#039;s just talking heads - the most fluid animation happens during the preparation of the cocktails; still, the characters smile, frown, gesture, grimace - and blink! - while in the background there&#039;s the occasional patron going to the toilets, blowing smoke or adjusting his chair.<br />
There is the CG that, given its age, is far from photographic; still, it is pretty much limited to the flow of liquids and the sparkle of bubbles in tall glasses, and doesn&#039;t interfere in the enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
The OP is a nice duet between a female patron and the bartender; it is, however, too upbeat for such slow and intimate series. The ED is a delicious jazz song, played while a real barman prepares and serves us the cocktail featured in the episode... Not once did I feel the urge to skip it, instead I wanted to pick up the glass and sip it.<br />
The rest of the music is ambient soft jazz, jamming in harmony to the scenes and accompanying the mood without ever overwhelming - which, for such a series, is just perfect.<br />
The background sounds are what one should expect from a small bar: glasses and bottles clinking or tapping on the table, chairs dragging, and the such - nothing spectacular, since anything more would actually detract from the experience.<br />
<br />
---<br />
Essence score [3;8]: 7.8<br />
Existence modifier [-2;+2]: +1.7<br />
Overall: 7.8 +1.7 = 9.5 --&gt; 10

    At first glance, Bartender appears mundane. It appears to be one of those self indulgent works that could easily turn you off. I mean, are we really going to spend 25 minutes talking about a bartender, and drinking? But you are wrong! This is one anime that is really interesting. We have here a work from someone who loves drinks and presents it to you in a very creative way.<br />
<br />
The stories to me are real, and relatable. Each episode appeals to the mind and the emotion. There is no cheezy moment that you see in most slice of life anime. The writer of this puts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3754">
        effort into making each episode captivating. Something worth noting is that Bartender is slow paced, but not drawn out. I felt like the timing, conversations and narrations were excellently synchronized. One thing I really enjoyed in the story were the narrations - it was so well placed.<br />
<br />
The art is crisp. I also enjoyed the visuals in this. In some instances you feel the life of a bar...thanks to the lighting. The shots of the city at night were lovely. Another thing in the art was how the character flashbacks showing the younger years were so realistic, and when the older character is shown it feels like a real aging process had taken place. The art is lovely in this.<br />
<br />
There is nothing extraordinary about the sound. It is well done, and is of the expected quality. One thing I should point out is how nice the ending soundtrack is, I like it a lot. Usually I skip listening to a soundtrack after hearing it once, but in Bartender&#039;s case, I wont mind having a copy of that song!<br />
<br />
The characters are well rounded. The bartender at first seems one sided in the stories, more like a prop. But as the series continue, you see how human he is. I love it. There are various narrators in this story, but I particularly enjoyed the (few) scenes when the &amp;quot;NeoBartenders&amp;quot; give history or insight into some topics.<br />
<br />
I loved this series, and would recommend it for anyone. It is well paced, and good to enjoy especially on a weekend, or at night after work. Lovely, Lovely Lovely. Thanks for reading this review.

    Anime as a medium is very diverse; it covers every topic, premise, and concept under the sun. But for the most part, a majority of the shows that occupy the surface tend to be spastic in portrayal. Often using eccentric personalities and brightly lit set designs to draw the attention of passing observers. Like neon lights hanging outside a store window, each vying for the attention of new customers. This kind of presentation within itself is fine, but every now and then, we as an audience seek out titles with a change of pace, something to help us unwind from the schizoid bubbly madness of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180549">
        neon lights and confetti that the medium is typically known for. As it would have it, Bartender happens to be such a title; a show that leans more towards a somber, easygoing tone, with it a promise of tranquility and relaxation upon entering its world. Something handled with a sense of class and composed order. And like the drinks themselves that it will come to discuss, so too does this show handle itself with a sense of meditation. A title that ushers the viewer out of the cold and into the warm cavernous embrace of its narrative.<br />
<br />
But this bar isn&#039;t without fault, as it seems the very strength of subtlety it conveys has also worked against its favor. The ethereal spell cast upon those that enter revealed to be the smoke of cheap incense purchased across the street from the very schizoid neon-lit stores we as viewers were trying to avoid. We sought for Mushishi and Kino&#039;s Journey — this isn&#039;t it. In place of real oak floorboards, we have laminate stick-on tiles. An emulation of highly refined content that&#039;s quickly made apparent the further we walk across its wax covered surface and sit by the bar counter to be served up a drink. A drink of idealism too sweet to swallow, but still worth discussing nonetheless.  <br />
<br />
The most durable aspect of this anime comes from the individual stories and how well they are put together. The entirety of its run-time takes place in the bar Eden Hall, and for the most part, they almost always follow the same structure, where our lead bartender Ryuu Sasakura solves our clients&#039; problems over a glass of a particular alcoholic beverage. What&#039;s perhaps more interesting than these wandering clients themselves are the segments within each episode dedicated to discussing the history of particular drinks and how they came to be. The tale of their origins usually providing a bit of insight as to why the bartender suggested the drink, as well as a means of newfound appreciation for the alcoholic beverage in question. <br />
<br />
In Bartender, drinks are given a new meaning, not in their history but in the way they are discussed. Instead of merely existing as a means of getting shit-faced, drinks are treated as an art form, elevating itself above just cheap service. This being demonstrated with the techniques shown in the serving of any individual spirit. A kind of drink engineering of precise measurement and emphasis on care. As you could imagine, It can get a little campy at times since the anime seems to promote a motto of &quot;drinking is the key to life, the key to soothing one&#039;s soul,&quot; but you never for a second doubt its intentions when making those bold statements. However, what is brought into question is what those bold statements are used to service. Bartender haphazardly attempts to solve every issue over a glass of alcohol. And this is where it all clashes. Where the authoritative position it holds towards itself can&#039;t be taken seriously with the dime-store purchased incense burning away, and the artificial sheen of fake wax floorboards glaring from under your feet.<br />
<br />
This anime&#039;s mythical portrayal of spirits as a healing agent for every person&#039;s problem robs it of all the down-to-earth qualities it desperately holds onto. A title that treats mundanity as transcendent things capable of toppling the sobering realities of life itself. All attempts to take the show seriously is rendered impossible, as it unintentionally rides the border of parody. <br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t also help that the entire thing looks like it was made on a shoestring budget. The soft glow of bar lights reduced to splodges of overlayered color. Wood presented with the texture of plastic. Drinks that have the appearance of CGI molasses. <br />
<br />
When compared to other titles made within the same year, it&#039;s average at best. Made all the more glaring when accounting for the fact that shows like Mushishi, 009-1, Black Lagoon, Ergo Proxy, Nana, Higurashi, and Hell Girl, just to name a few, were among those entries in question. By virtue of comparison, it&#039;s like juxtaposing high-end marble floors with Walmart linoleum. <br />
<br />
Everything was just incredibly flat-looking. Characters talking but only the immediacy of mouth-flaps being recognized. Scene framing devoid of dynamics or personality. Panning across stills to avoid animation. Cut-out models to avoid intimacy. The universe of Bartender just rings hollow, making the electric glow of the neon-lit titles behind our backs as we uncomfortably position ourselves on the bar stool that more inviting. If anything, this oasis becomes a way of indirect advertisement for the happy-go-lucky works that surround it. <br />
<br />
Which leaves us with only one thing left to address, the man of the hour positioned on the other side of the counter. The one that&#039;s been serving us drinks all night with a calming smile and a demeanor that speaks for his expertise, Ryuu Sasakura. Characterized as a well-kept, caring man, Ryuu was perhaps Bartender&#039;s strongest selling point, as he treats everyone that walks into his bar as welcomed guests. Nothing less is expected from the namesake of the series, but perhaps his talents are entirely too good for the project he&#039;s attached to. You see, Ryuu is basically the Houdini of bartenders, seemingly knowing every alcoholic beverage as a matter of principal. Like a walking encyclopedia of everything drink related, as well as a master at reading people&#039;s characteristics upon first encounter. These attributes have earned him the nickname &quot;Glass of the Gods&quot; among the city-folk.  <br />
Very little is known about Ryuu&#039;s personal life, with only one episode being dedicated to his humble beginnings as a bartender. What we do know of him has more so to do with his interaction with those he hosts. Instead, he is treated as an aficionado to help teach the viewer about the different types of drinks and the importance they hold in the annals of history.<br />
<br />
There are recurring characters, but their purpose in the narrative was far too minuscule to worth addressing. In this unpolished world of linoleum and cheap trinkets, Ryuu is the only takeaway aspect worth holding on to. <br />
<br />
Aside from the moments dedicated towards alcoholic infotainment, there isn&#039;t much here worth recommending to others. There are far better &quot;zen&quot; alternatives out there for those seeking an oasis away from anime&#039;s usual clutter; some of which aired the exact same year as this show. Ultimately, when it all boils down to it, Bartender with an earnest title that sadly relied on a false sense of authenticity, of which, it wasn&#039;t given the proper attention needed to be able to mask that truth. But the fact that drinks were treated as an end-all-be-all solution for the customers that came to Eden Hall was truly the reason I could never suggest this title if wasn&#039;t on your radar, to begin with. At the end of the day, tackiness killed this show and there&#039;s no other way around it. A title buried by time but sadly one I can&#039;t see any value in resurrecting.

    Two words: unique experience!<br />
<br />
Upon first approaching this anime I was expecting this series’s &quot;Bartender&quot; theme to simply be a gimmick, but no it is actual everything you would expect from an anime that deals heavily with life in a bar. (minus the fist fights of course, since this is a small classy bar)<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
Bartender revolves around a young man named &quot;Ryu Sasakura&quot; and his many experiences working in a small town bar of his. The main chunk of the story will deal with one of two things the whole way through: Ryu listening to his customer’s problems, and giving a pretty in depth history on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11660">
        many drinks. So with that in mind I feel that I should warn you now--to be expecting lots and LOTS of dialog in this series. The story itself is quite interesting, as you get a good variety of situations from the customer’s circumstances--from love, misunderstandings, work related problems and so on. It’s remains quite realistic with all of it’s content in the plots. My biggest complaint with it, is that it remains a bit too strait forward with the story, and perhaps sticks a bit too much to its &quot;Bartender&quot; theme. Rarely will you ever see Ryu out of his bar, plus we never get any real development from the story either--just one customer’s problems after another. However it does do some things to help keep the plot from getting tedious, and that is with the drinks themselves. Ryu never simply just serves the drinks to his customers, but also enlightens them on how to make it, and how said drink will help in their problems. This helps tremendously in keeping the theme from becoming a gimmick, and you can really tell that the writers looked into the history and style to each drink the anime talks about. It is also interesting to note that you get some nifty recipes to the main beverage of the episode upon its conclusion. (since each skit highlights a particular drink or two) The atmosphere from the story is fantastic, and makes you want to cozy yourself up in a nice warm blanket on a cold day when watching it. Overall it accomplishes what it sets out to do--it&#039;s a &quot;slice of life&quot; anime about a Bartender at work!<br />
<br />
Bartender doesn’t really contain anything offensive other than the obvious--alcohol! However it doesn’t do it in a harmful or bad way, but more in an educational approach. In fact out of all 11 episodes only once do I recall a costumer ever coming off as even &quot;tipsy.&quot; There is some brief language ever now and then, but pretty sparse over all.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The art style contains mostly dark style backgrounds and nicely detailed characters and environments. What caught my attention most with the art was the bottles in the background behind Ryu. They have been pain-painstakingly detailed to each beverage (different shapes and designs from each bottle). There isn’t a lot of fluidity in the series because there is very little action to speak of, and will only catch your attention with the drinks being poured into the glasses. Since this anime only takes place at night as a whole, get use to seeing the color black a lot. But each character was animated nicely, and they looked like their respected ages. The animation may not be anything really spectacular, but it does fit the anime very well.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack: 9/10<br />
The sound is the strongest point of the anime, to sum it all up: very relaxing! A lot of jazz style piano tracks surround the background. Even the voice cast they got for all of the characters were very soothing to listen to. (this is especially true with the narrator that begins each episode.) It was intentionally made this way to fit the layed back bar theme, and I feel they pulled it off quite nicely! It will most likely get mixed results with the viewers, because when it comes right down to it--it is jazz music after all, and it is pretty standard for it’s genera too. So if you aren’t a fan of it to begin with then this title certainly wont make you change your mind. But if you can appreciate it’s music content, you will simply love it!<br />
<br />
Characters: 8/10<br />
All the staple characters to the series are pretty small in numbers. You only really get about three--the Bartender, the Narrator and this young women named Miwa (who pops in during many episodes as either a costumer, or does some narrating of her own) Their not particularly deep characters, and despite the fact that Ryu is indeed the main lead of the show, he is over shadowed by the customers who get way more screen time than him. I also don’t feel that he was used the best either, as he never really showed off much of a personality when compared to the customers, and only seemed to be there to give advice. (almost like he was only part of the scenery at times) But despite that fact the cast is indeed likable, and all act the way most adults would. Nobody ever comes off as exaggerated, and is very down to earth in their personalities. I liked all of the characters as a whole, and really cared for them to get a fix for their problems in the end.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
Bartender can be considered the &quot;Opera&quot; of the anime world. To some it may be as entertaining as watching the grass grow, yet to others a truly unique experience that is a nice breath of fresh air with it’s content. And hey, you can actually learn some history from it too! Bartender is neither deep nor complex, its strongest asset is the relaxing atmosphere it surrounds you in, it’s a great title to watch when you need to unwind after a hard day at work. The best way I think you can enjoy this anime? Wait for night fall, kick off your shoes, sit back and...relax...

    Before I get to the bulk of the review,<br />
<br />
Imagine the thought of going to a bar for the very first time. Even after going through the trouble of eventually arriving at one, you stand outside the bar idly, wondering whether you should go in or not. Afraid that you’ll be made fun of, afraid you’ll embarrass yourself, you become anxious and the door handle feels heavy, as if it’s shutting you out. But mustering up the courage, you cautiously open the door and take a peek inside. Dim lights, gentle murmurs of people talking, occasional clangs of glasses, classy jazz playing in the background; all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review123379">
        of this is very foreign to you. But then you hear the gentle “welcome” from the bartender, and your anxious heart has suddenly calmed down and you magically find yourself sitting at the counter.<br />
<br />
In this otherwise foreign place, the simple “welcome” suddenly makes the bar a space where you can express yourself freely; and like the “gentle perch” that he is, the bartender calmly listens to all that you have to say. So starts the story from your heart… and from that story the bartender provides you with the perfect drink that carries with it the words, the emotions, and the memories of your story.<br />
<br />
The above description depicts the sort of atmosphere you should expect from Bartender. This anime focuses mainly on Sasakura Ryuu, a young genius bartender nicknamed the “Glass of the Gods” because of his keen sense of discernment for his customers and his ability to make quality cocktails deftly. He works at a small bar called “Eden Hall,” but despite its diminutive size, several people with personal problems frequent here. Sasakura Ryuu listens to whatever these people have on their minds, much like a physician, and then prescribes the perfect medicine in the form of a cocktail.<br />
<br />
The concept of solving problems through cocktails is what ultimately attracted me to this anime, but I understand that not all of us can relate to an anime about bartending; some of us detest the idea of drinking in the first place. However, as the anime takes on an episodic style of storytelling, each episode tells beautifully the story about a certain customer and a certain cocktail. Then the anime ties the two stories together masterfully to reach a heartwarming resolution. So if alcohol isn’t the initial attraction to this anime, just keep in mind that this anime focuses more on telling a memorable story to its viewers. The main criticism with the storytelling, however, is that the delivery can be a bit awkward and confusing at times, especially when the anime chooses to have some of the secondary characters start narrating the stories as omniscient third person narrators. In addition, since this anime is episodic, there isn’t an overarching plot connecting all the stories together. As a result, this anime becomes merely a collection of short stories rather than an anime with a continuous plot.<br />
<br />
As for the viewers who can relate to this anime and appreciate drinking from time to time, Bartender teaches the basics of bar etiquette, fun facts about certain drinks, and the history behind several cocktails and other drinks. The main criticism here is that the anime is in some ways more educational than it is entertaining, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with it having educational value. I, for one, rate an anime highly when it goes beyond being simply a form of art to teach me something new. However, since the anime does spend a good amount of time in each episode to explain the history or list out the various trivia about a certain cocktail, the focus of the story tends to deviate a little. <br />
<br />
With the anime busy from telling two stories or more in one episode, there is barely any room for character development. Arguably, the most developed character in the anime is Sasakura Ryuu, because viewers learn about his personality, thought process, morals, and bartending philosophies. However, at the same time the viewers learn nothing significant about him because the “Sasakura Ryuu” introduced to viewers at the start of the anime is a professional with very little room for improvement and development. There is an episode dedicated to how he learned from a mistake he made in the past, but generally the episodes focus on him being a problem-solver and not a problem-maker. As a result, there is actually very little development of the main character and the development is more focused on the secondary characters within each episode. Although I fairly enjoyed this anime, in the end I cannot say I really formed a personal connection with either Sasakura Ryuu or the secondary characters. <br />
<br />
To end, I want to point out some of the many subtle aspects that made this anime even better:<br />
<br />
1) The music: As fitting of a bar setting, smooth jazz plays in the background throughout the anime to add a touch of elegance that is unique to this type of anime. The soundtrack itself is also a wonderful collection of smooth jazz that I could listen to while studying, reading, or relaxing in a café or library. Overall, the music is superb and ultimately aids in amplifying the “classy” mood of the anime. <br />
<br />
2) The ending: Viewers usually neglect the ending because most often than not it’s the same song with the same animation playing every time. In the case of Bartender, however, every ending is special and unique to the episode. This is because an actual bartender makes a cocktail aforementioned in an episode while the ending song plays in the background. This aspect allowed me to appreciate the ending song even more, as well as further my interest in the world of bartending.<br />
<br />
3) A touch of reality: Whether it’s the history, the fun facts, or other trivia about alcohol, I could always tell that Bartender did its research in regards to bartending. I could especially tell by Sasakura Ryuu’s movement when making drinks, because his movements mimicked that of the actual bartender when he makes drinks during the ending song. The anime also uses real life alcohol brands instead of censoring them, thus adding another touch of reality. <br />
<br />
Bartender is definitely not for everyone; but it definitely has its stories to tell, and these stories are meant to be told to everyone. Much like a cocktail itself, Bartender aims to mend the tired soul laden with burdens, misunderstandings, pains, anxiety, and depression from everyday life. <br />
<br />
If you are looking for a truly therapeutic and healing anime, look no further because Bartender will be there to listen to your stories.<br />

    First of all, let me say that my rather middling score of this anime is in no way a sign of any deficiency on the show&#039;s part.  The series was pretty much exactly what it set out to be.  A slice of life show about a bartender helping people by serving them exactly the right drink.  Although the show did wax a bit too poetical about the drinks for my taste, it was surprising how well they tied it together.<br />
<br />
Rather, the score reflects the fact that this anime is not for me.  In fact, I&#039;m not exactly sure who it is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6443">
        for.  I have one friend who is into mixed drinks (in fact, he served as a bartender for a short time), but he isn&#039;t really one for slice of life drama.  Likewise, I have a number of friends who like slice of life shows, but would be positively baffled by the bartending aspect of it.<br />
<br />
But, if there is someone out there who has more than a passing interest in mixed drinks (by which I mean an interest beyond imbibing them), and likes slice of life drama, then I heartily recommend this show to you.<br />
<br />
Although I&#039;m not a great fan if this show, I sincerely hope that it did well.  I think it would definitely help anime if there were more shows with odd premises targeting niche groups.  Anime on the whole is getting a bit stagnant, and by now most of the old tropes have been trod over and over.  So hats off to anyone experimenting in the medium.

    This is probably the best anime I&#039;ve seen to date. Everything about it is just made of awesome. The opening song is catchy, the overall drawing style is beautiful without being &quot;over the top&quot;, the scene changes are well made, the characters are likeable and relate-able, the voices are great (especially the narrator&#039;s), and the variety from episode to episode will keep you wanting to see the next one.<br />
<br />
Throughout every single episode, you&#039;ll be laughing, crying, pondering, and a bunch of other &quot;-ing&quot;s, because it&#039;s just that good. I simply cannot praise it enough. I&#039;m so sad it had only 11 episodes, but I also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12935">
        believe that if they dragged it out, it would ruin the show. Nevertheless, I would have liked if they had made 2 or 3 episodes more, but that&#039;s just me.<br />
<br />
The immense awesomeness of this series made me seriously want to become one of those old-school bartenders, much like Ryū is (none of that club-bartending for me), or at the very least learn how to make coctails for friends. And that&#039;s when you know you have a good anime. When you aspire to be like one of the characters, while still retaining a sense of realism of your abilities. I mean... a lot of people would like to be ninjas, but that doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re going to Kage Bunshin no Jutsu their way out of going to work/school any time soon (I just broke someone&#039;s hopes and dreams, didn&#039;t I?).<br />
<br />
It is that atmosphere of &quot;unrealistic realism&quot;, in the sense of &quot;everything you see, could very well happen in everyday life in a bar. It&#039;s not very likely, but gosh I hope it does&quot; that helps set the entire mood. It&#039;s calm, welcoming, and the setting just affects you somehow on an emotional level without you ever really noticing it until that one tear rolls down your cheek. After a while, you want a bar like Eden Hall to exist and you want there to be a bartender like Ryū to serve you cocktails and to whom you can open up to. Anywho, in conclusion, watch this utterly, utterly awesome anime, I&#039;ll guarantee you that you&#039;ll like it.

    Do you like going to a bar to relax and forget the world? That’s exactly what this show is about and the feeling I get from it. The first time I heard about this show was from Arkada from http://www.desudesbrigade.com (Which is not existing right now. If you wish to see his stuff, please find him at http://blip.tv/glassreflection/ ) and when I did hear of it, I thought that the main character would be mostly the focus and how he would get a lot of screen time but in truth, I was wrong and love it all the same. The main focus is not of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review63927">
        the bartender exactly, but of the customers giving each show its own cast, and own character screen time. In fact, even though some of the characters reappear in other episodes, they are not really anything but to relay some message that might not be known about the main character of that episode.<br />
<br />
In each episode, the story line stands alone, nothing you have to remember from the last show unless you want to know what the other side characters are from and so your full attention is on the show right in front of you, giving you the same feeling as what the bar is like, where nothing from the outside world should interrupt you from enjoying the special drink. In my mind, our drink as the viewers is the show in front of us like the drink in front of the customer is the one they talk about. And like all good drinks, the show does not leave a bad taste so you can enjoy the slow easy going nature. It’s a good show to watch right after watching a high action packed show as a way of winding down. <br />
<br />
There is almost no point in this story where it feels off-key and fantasy like. The stories are very real, everyday problems that normal people would have. A woman who wishes to help break the tension between her father and grandfather; a man who works on creating bars but doesn’t like them; a man who came to the bar after seeing a ‘shining star’ walk in, these are the fears and dreams of so many different people, not just in Japan but all over the world. This anime seems to speak to you as an individual, not just to a wide number of people. They even go so far as to address the watcher, breaking the fourth wall as though you are with these people. <br />
<br />
Like almost every anime out there, this one has a Christmas episode but unlike all the others, it doesn’t feel like it was forced into the show. It actually feels perfect with no ‘hot girl’ showing off what she’s got in a scandalous Santa outfit. In fact, there is really no Santa outfit at all and no talk of what Christmas is. They only give you the warm feeling that would make you smile, much like how a drink would warm you up slowly. <br />
<br />
The animation is so beautiful. There is a lot of CG when it comes to the bottles and glasses but it never feels out-of-place. It feels a part of this art and never gets distracting from the characters. As for everything else though, the only other ‘CG style’ things could be the liquor and the glass when they stand alone. It doesn’t get in the way of the artwork at all though or make it feel out of place as they merge it well. It’s interesting that at first glance, you would never really see Ryu as anything special, just pretty much a standard Japanese character in a bartenders outfit. I truly love that about this show, the very simple and gentle feeling. They have a lot of scenes that loop or are taken from other shows but I never saw it as a eye sore except for one instance. <br />
<br />
The ending of each episode is surprisingly very simple live action of a bartender creating a drink, mixed with a little CG and music video. This is one of the most beautiful and gentle ending I have ever seen and they made it different for every single episode, the drink being different for each one. It’s so calming and gentle that I actually wanted to keep watching the ending, not speed past it. The cinematic camera angles add to the somewhat surreal feeling of just being in the current place at the special time. The music for the ending as well was so sweet that I want to get a single disc of it and play it as I fall asleep.<br />
<br />
Now, when we get to the opening, I do have my problems. The opening animation is beautiful and amazing but the music seems to put me off a bit. I watched a couple of these in line and the music unfortunately felt a little too upbeat. It’s not that it wasn’t any good; it was just that it didn’t seem to fit the feeling of the show.<br />
At no part is there really a time that has no talking or music and only silence. All the music is orchestrated well and fits perfectly. There one song for every drink and each of them seem to reflect the story of that drink. <br />
<br />
The voices, while expertly done by the Japanese actors, seemed a little off for me but I believe that was only because I am really not into subs. I will read subs while watching the English dub and see how close they were to the original but mostly. But when they give me subs, I have a hard time with them since I have to read a little to fast. I fell into that with this show and so the Japanese voices felt distant and hard to get close to but I feel if I was a native Japanese speaker, I would be much more into loving it. This is one that I really hope comes over to America to be dubbed and not ‘fucked up’ with a lot of script changes and high vocals. PS I think J. Michael Tatum would be a great Ryu. Just my thoughts on it. ;)

    Being a teenage girl, perhaps this anime wasn&#039;t right up my alley, so to speak. I admit, I do not like alcohol all that much. So, seeing as the entire basis of this anime was around specific drinks, what&#039;s in them, and their history I found it a bit boring.<br />
<br />
Story: 4<br />
Bartender is one of those series where the story changes from episode to episode. Each one deals with a different person, where they are in life, and how Sasakura&#039;s bartending skills help them. I found that the stories tended to be hard to follow or even practically nonexistent. Even with the episodes that had clear

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21953">
        and easily understood plot it seemed that the &#039;storyline&#039; wasn&#039;t even focused on all that much. Instead, many background stories about the drinks used were given and the plot became a bit fuzzy.<br />
<br />
Art: 6 <br />
The art of the backgrounds is actually quite nice. And the bottles all look almost real. As for character design look, the people looked alright but there were some of the men who just seemed... off. I&#039;d describe is as: their eyes didn&#039;t seem to fit their faces. It was quite odd. But, I feel like the people themselves could&#039;ve had better animation.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
The music was well chosen for each scene that there was music. None of the characters had overly annoying voices; each actor/actress&#039; voice seemed to fit well with their character. <br />
<br />
Character: 3<br />
There was practically NO character development at all! There technically was a bit with some of the minor characters that were the focus of each separate episode. But, Sasakura... NOTHING! And, not knowing anything about your main character is quite aggravating. Also: the chick... the blonde one (Mika? was it?) why did she keep showing up everywhere? I didn&#039;t understand why she narrated things. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4<br />
I felt that this anime was, while watchable, rather boring.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4<br />
There wasn&#039;t enough character development or movement to the story. There wasn&#039;t even really a story to begin with. The plot that was there was choppy and was interrupted with bits of random history about the alcoholic beverages. Bartender is definitely something out of the ordinary. I would only recommend this to a person who has an interest in alcohol, patience, and a low-key attitude.

    A rare gem of an anime, made for people who are mature enough to enjoy a calm and slow-paced but inspiring drama. <br />
<br />
The musical score is breathtaking, and quite appropriate for the gritty city setting of the bar, with a lot of nice jazzy tracks.<br />
<br />
The characters in Bartender are very colorful and human, each with their own flaws and problems. <br />
<br />
On a whole, little about this series is idealized and dumbed-down for the masses; on the contrary, it&#039;s a very classy anime that has a certain maturity requirement to watch. If you don&#039;t appreciate this show for what it is, then it&#039;s your loss.

    When I review or recommend an anime, I try to compare it to another from its genre. I simply can&#039;t do that with Bartender. Maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;m considerably picky about the series&#039;s&#039;s that I invest my time into, so my frame of reference is limited, but I&#039;ve never seen or heard of a series like this. <br />
<br />
As you could probably guess, it&#039;s about a bartender. Ryuu, known by some as the &quot;Glass of the Gods&quot;, is a passionate bartender who tends to the inconspicuous bar of Eden Hall. One way or another, troubled souls find their way into Eden Hall, and with his unwavering

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193341">
        demeanor and knowledge of alcoholic beverages, he helps them with their problems. <br />
<br />
The most immediate praise I have to give Bartender is the soundtrack. It&#039;s unbelievable what they&#039;ve done here. For all the applause I&#039;m going to give the rest of the components of the series, the music is foremost in its quality. If you could find where to purchase it, I would highly recommend copping the OST. Each of the featured drinks has its own song, all immaculately composed, and of course, the opening and ending themes are fantastic as well. <br />
<br />
The story is well written, meaningful, and remarkably moving. I almost never cry, especially not while watching anime/movies. Edgy, I know. However, Bartender&#039;s writing has a very rare quality that I can&#039;t place my finger on, but it gets to me in a way that other &quot;emotional&quot; animes,  like Madoka Magicka for example, never do. The writers did an A+ job of incorporating the history of each drink into solving the featured customer&#039;s problem, so you&#039;re also sure to walk away with some kind of conversation fuel, or maybe just a new appreciation for one of your choice drinks. <br />
<br />
The only thing that won&#039;t get a perfect 10 from me is the art. It&#039;s not even that I&#039;m NOT fond of this particular art style, I just think there are better styles out there. It works, it by NO means looks bad, and the rest of the art is fantastic. The aesthetic is very unique, and combined with the soundtrack it makes this one of the comfiest animes I&#039;ve ever watched. <br />
<br />
The characters are all fantastically written. None of them feel &quot;forced&quot; or fall directly into some overdone archetype. They all feel very genuine, and that plays a big part in how engrossed into the story you&#039;ll be. <br />
<br />
So if you haven&#039;t guessed by now, this is one of my favorite animes. I can&#039;t recommend this enough. It&#039;s a cozy, moving, enjoyable series, and the only thing you&#039;ll regret about it is that it wasn&#039;t longer. It gets a perfect 10 from me. Go watch it. Like, right now.<br />
<br />
Oh, and as a bonus, they give you the recipe for the featured drink after the credits. So if you&#039;re into mixing drinks, it&#039;s just one more reason to watch.

    Animation- 6<br />
The look of the show is fine. There really isn&#039;t anything visually interesting about the show with the exception of the presentation of the drinks I suppose. Everything works fine, and you feel like you&#039;ve seen a lot of the characters and places before. Whether or not this feeling of familiarity is intended still gave me rather ho-hum feelings toward the look.<br />
Sound- 7<br />
Again, not much to write about here, the opening and ending are both forgetable. On a refresher listen on youtube, it was as if I was hearing the opening for the first time. The ending is better, giving a suitable tone for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10164">
        the wrap up of the show. The voice acting was standard, again nothing really exceptional. I will say the foley for the bar is really evocative. The chatter, clinking of glasses, scooting of chairs, and espically the sound of drinks being poured and ice getting carved saved this from just being average.<br />
Characters- 8<br />
I feel like the characters who were the focus of each drink are fully realized, but I remember most of the supporting character to be rather flat and just a medium to progress the story. Ryuu included is also a little lifeless until he is given his own backstory, but is still a little wooden in the present.<br />
Story- 9<br />
I loved how the some characters are tangential to other characters&#039; stories, and often appear where you least expect them. The gem of this anime for me is the story with the director. Without spoiling, I think it captured the essence of his and many other artists plight quite truthfully and with out a lot of embellishment. This is the best trait of the series: the lack of hyperbole and severe melodrama in favor for more down to earth plot and storytelling.<br />
Enjoyment- 8<br />
I really liked this show and wish that there was more. Clipping the series at 11 made me feel like they ran out of ideas for 13 or that they just didnt know what to do. I really think that a another story could have been told to make the show feel more complete. Perhaps if the first story was better then I would have felt more satisfied. <br />
Overall- 8/10

    If you want long reviews detailing every detail of the anime read another review, this review is based on what the bartender Sasakura, Ryuu taught me.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m a bartender, I have been for 2 years by now and it&#039;s a job I love, you chat with a lot of people and have lots of fun, but there are times that you can&#039;t read a situation and how to deal with certain types of clients. What I had learn of watching Sasakura changed my way of dealing with customers, I have become a lot more friendly and charming to them, and I have received a lot of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review141717">
        great experiences and compliments coming from them.<br />
<br />
I must say, Bartender is a show that you can enjoy without knowdledge of the profesion, or you can learn a lot of how to help people enjoy that drink that we all must serve to our customers: A drink to have fun.<br />
<br />
Because at the end anyone can serve a drink, but a few can make a cocktail.

    Not too often I see an anime of an acquired taste on caliber with the likes of Bartender. While I&#039;m normally not into drinking alcohol, Bartender&#039;s large focus on the drink and its influence on the customers that visit Ryu&#039;s tavern made me somewhat tempted at points to consider the idea. Much like similar titles such as Mushishi and Mokke, Bartender offers up episodic stories of Ryu conversing with and tending to the woes of his customers with a drink that compliments and relieves them of their conflicting situation. The situations with each character Ryu meets throughout Bartender are fleshed out enough where you get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37991">
        a sense of what inner conflicts they face and what led to their present situation. Main character Ryu comes across as a likeable one as his formal attire and etiquette with serving his customers and handling alcohol adds to the mellow and classy mood that Bartender consistently gives off throughout each of its episodes.<br />
<br />
The narrative style of Bartender is also worth mention. Regular customers of Ryu serve to provide frequent narration in covering the dilemmas faced by his customers as the series tends to transition between present and past time frames. Also with the plot centered around alcohol, the series also goes into moments to cover information on the various histories and details surrounding the alcohol and cocktails that Ryu serves and makes to his customers. The series even shows off a &quot;featured&quot; cocktail at the end of each episode featuring the ingredients and measurements of how to put together said cocktail. Whoever made the original story of Bartender did their research on different types of alcohol and cocktails quite meticulously, adding to this show&#039;s unique feel.<br />
<br />
The visual and aural presentation to Bartender do well at matching the quality of the storytelling that the series conveys. On the visual end, Bartender has plenty of detail in presenting its settings and character designs. This is especially apparent in the designs of the various glasses, wine bottles and cocktails that are within Ryu&#039;s tavern, right down to the label itself. While not as strongly shown, animation has its moments to show its stuff when Ryu and other bartenders are preparing drinks. The music features mostly mellow and upbeat tracks that do well to complement the classy mood given off through the show&#039;s storylines.<br />
<br />
While I personally did find this series enjoyable, bare in mind that Bartender is an acquired taste thanks to its niche topic and episodic storytelling thus not everyone will get enjoyment out of it. But if you are looking for something different to look into, Bartender has enough of an original premise that could grab your interest, especially if you have a craving for the more classy side of sampling alcohol.

    How can a show that relates itself around alcohol be interesting? <br />
<br />
A basic question, but one i was curious to know when I started this show. The creation and history of alcoholic drinks that can relate to a person&#039;s life, but how? Well like all my reviews Ill keep it short and sum everything up trying to be as spoiler free as possible.<br />
<br />
~STORY~<br />
<br />
The show follows a common slice of life trait being.....theirs no real overarching story. The show revolves around problems that the characters are facing in life and how are genius bartender helps them through it. The shows problems are nothing of extreme, they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187570">
        range from work issues to a hard married life. Its interesting how our Protagonist helps them though there problems. He gives lessons by the creation of drinks, more notably cocktails. In reality, this is perfect for the kind of show it is. Its a slow mellowed paced show with a calm and collect setting. <br />
<br />
~CHARACTERS~<br />
<br />
This unfortunately is were the show falls flat. We are introduced to a cast of characters each with there own problems, personality, and tastes. But the only person we actually get to know is the bartender. This also wouldn&#039;t be a problem if it wasn&#039;t for the fact that we never did get to know him well as a character, just a bartender. <br />
<br />
~ANIMATION~ <br />
<br />
The show is mixed when it comes to this. When the creation of drinks and the liquid effects appear, they look gorgeous. However, when its a casual scene or cocktails aren&#039;t being created, its rather bland in comparison. Its has a mix - mash of colors and looks gorgeous when it wants. But any other time, its fine.<br />
<br />
~ SOUND~<br />
<br />
There is no English dub that im aware of at this moment. However the music was perfect for this show. Slow, smooth, relaxing, just fits so perfect for the shows setting, atmosphere, pace, and all around enjoyment.<br />
<br />
~FINAL~<br />
<br />
The show gets a recommendation from me. The only complaint i have with the show is its first episode. If it wasnt for the second episode straightening things out to the point where I can understand it without thinking hard,  i would of dropped it. Its a slow show as well, so not for fast paced action fans. If your after a mellow anime look no further, its slow, mellow, enjoyable, and partially educational.<br />
<br />
Rating - buy it<br />
<br />

    Araki Joh&#039;s story BARTENDER tells the story of Ryu Sasakura, an<br />
exceptional bartender who uses his knowledge of people and cocktails to aid troubled customers. This simple premise provides an interesting and effective means to explore many aspects of (Japanese) life: the personal crises Japanese people face in their life, along with the history and culture of Japan, all linked together through Ryu providing the right beverage to help the customer gain a better perspective of life. <br />
<br />
The series&#039; stories are mainly down-to-earth and simple, an unusual but refreshing change for a genre noted for its larger-than-life<br />
adventures. The people are ordinary and realistic, with common problems

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204362">
        that we can understand and relate. In addition (and in an unusual contrast), the show employs an unconventional theatrical style: monologues from people that describe their inner thoughts,<br />
documentary-style vignettes (usually on drinks) and moody atmospheric scenes; this gives the show a surreal look and appeal, comparable to an unusual cocktail mixed from differing drinks.<br />
<br />
However, the show is admittedly a little uneven. The premise – that the right drink can sort out people&#039;s troubled lives – requires good<br />
writing for this to work, which this show doesn&#039;t always provide. At<br />
times a few stories aren&#039;t written well and thus the show&#039;s staged<br />
parts make those stories look artificial and contrived. Also, some<br />
episodes have a strong emphasis on Japanese culture, which can perhaps confuse and alienate non-Japanese viewers. But these are issues which can be overlooked, for the show generally deals in human beings and their lives and excels in understanding and explaining them. <br />
<br />
The animation is rather basic and at best above average, but that&#039;s OK; this type of story wasn&#039;t meant to have overly stylish visuals. The voice acting is adequate, nothing that stands out but again this isn&#039;t a flamboyant show. The music is probably what stands out the most; it&#039;s a fairly jazzy and elegant track that sets the urbane and cultured atmosphere of a Japanese bar. <br />
<br />
On the whole, it&#039;s a show that reflects its title character: rather<br />
quiet and catering to a specific audience, but a unique and refreshing experience.

    I cannot recommend this anime enough!<br />
<br />
Story- The story of this aniime is definitely is weakest point because it is for the most part episodic and it specifically has no story for the only constant character in this show. despite this flaw each episode has a beautifully done plot and those can be incredibly touching. 8/10<br />
<br />
Art- The art in this show is nothing to marvel at but they made nice use of their budget and the drink mixing looks great.7/10<br />
<br />
sound- they have all the sounds you would hear in a bar and I personally love the opening theme.9/10<br />
<br />
character- This is where the show truly shines, in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34251">
        each episode a whole new cast is invented and you get to know all of the characters that are introduced very well throughout only 25 minutes which is how it should be considering that is the main draw of the show. I could truthfully say that i was attached to the characters at the end of every episode.10/10<br />
<br />
enjoyment- How much you enjoy this show will depend very much on what your willing to sit through. The storys are told with relatively little action, the pacing is as fast as a snail, and it&#039;s not one of those shonen action animes but if you can get past that then it is truly a wonderful watch. 10/10<br />
<br />
Final words- This anime is great if your looking for something laid back that really treats it&#039;s audience like big boys and girls. 10/10

    Story: 10/10<br />
I adored the story! I like the unconventional way that each person&#039;s story is told, it draws you in and you feel relaxed. Comforted in the atmosphere of the bar, the characters, it grabs you right on the heart strings. It&#039;s just amazingly written, if I had to name a bad point is that sometimes it can be hard to follow but, at the end it all makes perfect sense. You just need the mind to read into things a bit deeper than is spoken aloud.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
It was standard art for the most part, but what got it a 9 overall was the eyes.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review41021">
        It&#039;s hard to portray feelings through eyes alone, yet this anime somehow accomplished that 98% of the time. Sometimes the emotion was lacking, but in those times it seems like it was meant to be that way.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
This got a poor rating, at least by my standards. You didn&#039;t notice the music much, but that I think was part of it&#039;s appeal. It wasn&#039;t over powering, it was delicate to the ears, never overriding the speaker, gently playing. White noise of sorts, there but not there, I think that&#039;s what set the mood for the anime. Yet it wouldn&#039;t have hurt to make it a bit more dominate.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
You didn&#039;t get TOO much back story on the main character to be frank, though what you do get is his humble beginnings. Which for me, means a lot, it shows that he wasn&#039;t ALWAYS the &quot;Glass of God&quot; that he had to start somewhere. Most anime&#039;s like this one, tend to exclude the main characters beginnings, feeling like it makes them...less special. I think the fact that they made mistakes makes them less perfect and in turn, makes them much more human. It also makes it easier for us to relate to that person when we realize how human they really are underneath it all!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
There are so few animes I enjoy thoroughly anymore, it seems like they&#039;ve got the same theme going at all times. I love anime that defy boundaries, try new things, and go beyond. So Bartender was an amazingly beautiful experience for me. I watched the whole series in a day, I was so entranced by it, I could hardly look away.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
This overall score is based on average. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for something more than sacs of fat jiggling around or hot guys being mentally unstable. I don&#039;t however, recommend this to anyone expecting something akin to Bleach/Naruto because you certainly won&#039;t find that here. It&#039;s very human, very realistic, and certainly a far cry from the norm.
