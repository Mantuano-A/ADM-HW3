    College life is a bit different from high school. For those who don’t know, it’s like venturing into a society where some people live by the rules and others makes them. To me, Grand Blue came as a show that explored a carefree life while mixing in adult humor, diving elements, and drinking shenanigans. It’s one of those shows that is hard to not laugh your ass off once you realized what you’re in for.<br />
<br />
Based on the manga written by Kenji Inoue, Grand Blue stands out more as a modern slice of life that adheres to a young adult cultural society. Here, we meet a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290271">
        guy named Iori Kithara who starts his new life as a college student on the Izu Peninsula. His place of residence happens to be a diving shop known as “Grand Blue” and thus where daily life adventure begins. Now, I should say right off the bat that a show like this relies on stereotypical humor with plenty of jokes in between. If you’re not ready for that, just turn back now. <br />
<br />
Grand Blue’s storytelling mainly chronicles the daily life adventures of Iori although plenty of other characters are featured aside him. The main cast consists of diving club, also known as the “Peek-a-Boo”. He meets others including his cousin Chisa, Nanaka, Kouhei, Azusa, Toshio, and Kotobuki. Among this group, the male cast seems more like they are in love with drinking more than diving. The first episode immediately sets off the humor with the nakedness and adult jokes from the very start as we meet the core members. That is to say, Iori himself also lacks common sense when he attends his first day at college while being half naked. Judging from just this impression, it should be easy to recognize that the show love to make fun of its characters. It uses stereotypes that makes fun of college life such as young adults drinking and partying. Then, there’s meta-humor that plays on jokes with the nudity. It’s also self-aware being that it never attempts to disguise its humor. Certain characters are very aware of their actions regardless of consequences and this often sets off the wrath of others such as Chisa.<br />
<br />
For the main female cast, it consists of a colorful group with a diverse range of personalities. The most level-headed person in the show is Chisa who takes many things in life seriously. She also loves diving and geniuely enjoys the feelings of being in the azure ocean. She’s like the anti-Peek-a-boo member in the show as she can’t tolerate being embarrassed. Because of this, there’s often a clash between her and Iori as the two gets into compromising positions. The end result is often Iori taking the blow and Chisa face palming herself. However, it’s also noticeable that she does care about Iori especially during brief flashbacks before them. Often times, I guess you could say that she misses her childhood with him and reliving those moments brings a peace in her mind. Then, we have Nanaka who seems to play the role of an older sister type for the main cast although at the same time, she also has an unhealthy infatuation towards Chisa. It’s the type of humor that makes fun of siblings but in a sarcastic way. Azusa is the senior student who behaves much more like the guys in the show. Her bisexuality is hinted at many times and often makes sexual jokes at others, especially Iori. Last but not least is Aina, a freshman who is much shyer compared to the others. She does go by another persona early in the series so watching her sometimes may remind you just how different her two personalities are.<br />
<br />
Between the guys, a main selling point in the show is the character chemistry. Regardless whether you like it or not, there’s an abundance amount of humor when the guys interact with each other and it often comes off as absurd humor. The most prominent is between Iori and Kouhei. They are often observant but says things that may be interpreted in the wrong way. They often get into trouble with the women in the show too given their actions that disregards common sense. The two also gets into many bickering moments. Early in the series, the series also makes fun of the guys with porn jokes. And let’s not forget about the drinking. Pretty every male character in the series loves to drink whether it’s alcohol, beer, vodka, wine, or whiskey. As you may expect from action that results in consequences, the guys behave like drunks while stripping naked and causing questionable scenes. The series pokes fun at this type of adult humor by covering their private body parts with black censored circles. It’s the type of self-aware humor that you’ll witness quite often.<br />
<br />
So now what? Is this series just a giant ball of meaningless humor? Or is it something more deceptive that people misunderstands? To me, Grand Blue stands out as a show that deals with adult gimmicks and stereotypes but makes it into a humorous flick. It seems like a popcorn entertainment and you’re not wrong if it feels like the story went nowhere in the end. However, the shows knows how it operates and inserts every joke with a clear intention. The guys in the series acts bold and behaves in ways that wild college students do. The girls are slightly mild but it doesn’t detract them from getting into the party on occasions. There’s a lot of running gags with the drinking jokes, nakedness, and misunderstandings. It’s what the series uses to sell its humor. If you’re in it for actual diving, there are some moments too with info dumps. Don’t expect this like a relaxing slice of life as it’s far too hyperactive to be considered as such though. Watch this for the pure entertainment and forget common logic. That way, you’ll grow to love Grand Blue.<br />
<br />
Zero-G has honestly been an unimpressive studio. Their lineup consists of shows that I hardly see anyone talks about these days (Battery, Dorei-kun the Animation, Dive!!). Their production quality is hardly stellar either. Thankfully, they managed to step up to the plate and capture the magic for this show. It deserved a glorious quality and got treated such way with the beach setting, aquatic ocean, and sunny atmosphere. Character designs also feels real with the cast looking like they are college students (although Aina sometimes makes me question this) Fan service is literally in every episode but they take the extreme during party scenes and drinking segments. Finally, I love the way characters reacts that pushes the envelope to the extreme. Iori and Kouhei are prime examples of this while others such as Chisa and Nanaka also have their own moments. Expressions of shock, anger, and confusion is shown right to your face in ridiculous ways. Thanks to the talented voice cast, it brings the best out of those moments. The OP song also adapts a playful feel to showcase the themes of the show. The ED theme song makes fun of pop culture such as karaoke that’s so fun to sing along with.<br />
<br />
As a fan of the manga, I think Grand Blue established itself as a self-aware humorous showstopper. Taking the risk of glorifying its humor made this show look like a joke at first glance. However, once you get sucked into Grand Blue’s themes, you’ll find love with this show. From the adult humor to the numerous character gags, it’s an anime that plays with itself. It’s a Summer sensation.

    Every season of anime always has that one show. You know the one. From the start it receives constant praise and love by the masses, unrelenting in their desire to make their short-lived adoration known to any that will hear. For weeks it leads the figurative hype-train that has every seasonal watcher on board in anticipation to see where it ends up. The show you stay up late at night each week just to catch the latest episode on Kis-Crunchyroll.com. While every other show with potential may and probably will squander around the half-way point, this show – THIS SHOW – is the only one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290273">
        to matter, for it holds the embodiment of why weeaboos traded their social life to solely watch Japanese cartoons.<br />
<br />
Newsflash: This ain’t it chief.<br />
<br />
To be honest, this season as a whole has been remarkably unremarkable given the obvious trends that take place in the anime community. Although it may not be so surprising given that the season prior was coined by many as ‘The Greatest Season of Anime’, even the most popular shows airing currently have made little more than a murmur throughout their runtime. Attack on Titan, Overlord, the “final” season of Gintama, all well-known series that have all fallen silent amongst the public. But when it comes to new series airing, Grand Blue had to have been a main attraction; based on one of the most popular manga serialized today that features Shinji Takamatsu as director – the same director for successful comedies School Rumble and Daily Lives of High School Boys. Yet… something’s seriously off about this show, and since it seems to have slapped the tactfulness out of me, I’m just gonna go ahead and say it: This show fucking blows. <br />
<br />
I was planning to say something along the lines of “Let’s dive into this”, but whilst being the most cliché cringe-inducing pun I could have possibly made, there’s not very much at all to “dive” into here. Grand Blue follows 20-year-old Iori Kitahara who has moved to his uncle’s seaside town for college, where he is almost immediately roped into joining a male-dominated diving club. But if you thought this show was about diving, it’s a trap! Instead the club activities more or less revolve around drinking, stripping and getting hammered. Essentially, it is a comedy anime focused on the college life so a basic plot such as this is harmless so long as the comedy hits its mark. However, that simply is not the case. Instead Grand Blue comes off as an American frat house flick turned into a gag anime, except with nearly all the effort sucked out. <br />
<br />
Now I understand that comedy in general is heavily subjective so what personally may not land well with me could very well come off as a massive hit to someone else. Nevertheless, I have so many issues with how the show handles humour. One of the first instances of this come from the running joke where every other character tries tricking Iori into getting drunk. Conceptually, this does not strike me as humorous, but the ridiculous ways this is tried alongside dysmorphic character faces utilized certainly add to the punchline and made me laugh the first few times. But a cardinal problem with Grand Blue is that a joke which becomes par runs the risk of growing dull, and while using different scenarios can keep things fresh, Grand Blue instead decides to drive them into the ground as fast as possible. Sure, the joke earned a few chuckles the first couple times, but then they use it once more, and again, and again… and again. Numerous times the overabundance of these quips was akin to beating a dead horse, and if at that point it does not feel overdone then I just do not know what to say. Clearly Grand Blue is a comedy show that lends itself to multiple running gags throughout the 12 episodes, but the way they are used is what inevitably ceases the series to deliver the same results each time on viewers like myself. <br />
<br />
Another issue with the comedy presented here more often than not is the timing. Timing is obviously a key factor for basically any form of comedy, especially with the kind of jokes Grand Blue exploits that rely heavily on the punchline. Yet here poor timing is so apparent that it comes off almost amateurish by the staff. Maybe this is a limitation when adapting the source material. I have not read the manga, but due to anime being… animated, it limits the way one can interpret a scene compared to a series of still pictures; the anime ends up much more restricting on the imagination. The punchlines themselves are also somewhat confusing at first if you had high expectations of Grand Blue without having read the manga. The series seems to treat comedy at a fairly lowbrow level where majority of the time punchlines were aimed between the more innocent characters being coerced or embarrassed by other club members. Sure, lowbrow humour can be funny and even I find it hilarious sometimes, but considering this is also a light-hearted comedy, makes Grand Blue’s task of making someone like myself laugh incredulously difficult. What also works in their disfavour are the more heartfelt moments mainly centred around Iori gaining appreciation for diving as a whole. These moments COULD have been useful as far as getting better invested in his character, except there is one serious problem: he has no character. You should not expect much in the way of development or characterization presented as there are only a handful of character worth remembering just to remember the plot meanwhile everyone else, despite their own “plot” are flat as a pancake. Again, due to Grand Blue being primarily comedy, there is barely any expectations as far as the narrative or characters go, yet the show continues to spread itself thin that I, as a viewer, am left with barely anything to truly grasp onto. Maybe I’m just an old fag.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the key problem I have with Grand Blue is not with the comedy or even the characters, but the subject matter. There has been an increasing amount of anime set in higher education as of late, each with their own take on a core aspect of college life. But before Grand Blue I had never been exposed to one that focuses primarily on the parts where the main characters get blasted off one’s face, and after watching this, it really does makes sense why. As a student myself I can tell you with assurance that there is not much fun getting shit-faced and even then, it does not last long. To those reading this that have experienced a hangover probably understand this most and, perhaps more importantly, the after-effects. Headaches, drowsiness, poor concentration and nausea are just a mere few of the symptoms that coincidentally are also felt when watching these moments every week. One of the most common appraisals about Grand Blue is how relatable the show is. I’m sorry but the main aspects that are relatable to real life here are not things that I would be celebrating as much and like those who have had poor hangovers, is something I would rather forget about. Although when it comes to alcohol in Grand Blue, there is nothing more depressing than seeing each episode open with a disclaimer about legal alcohol usage. Now, they were probably necessary to even have the series airing in the first place but way to present the exact opposite of comedy at the beginning of each episode. Of course nothing is mentioned about the nudity seemingly ever-present here; I see Japan has their priorities straight here.<br />
<br />
Speaking of; yes, I am a straight cis-male. I’m not ashamed. I have no interest in the male nudity displayed in Grand Blue, but holy hell do they have the least creative way of censoring dicks. As aforementioned I have not read the manga, so I do not know how scenes were drawn but it is such a lazy way of going about it, though it does match the effort that arguably went to the overall visuals of Grand Blue. It looks absolutely lacklustre. Below average animation for practically every scene. Poor designs, even for the male supporting cast (no homo). This is not a series to watch for its technical appeal, because there practically is none. However, I find this fact to somehow work in its favour as far as the entertainment goes. Seeing comedic scenes with laughable animation effects certainly has a charm to it; perhaps a “so bad it’s good” quality, but not enough to warrant slogging through it all. Even fanservice for the male demographic was at a minimum. As far as the sound, both the soundtrack and voice acting are very forgettable. The opening and endings, whilst memorable, I personally found cringeworthy. Never will I not skip either if they ever happen to come up on a playlist. Just listen to these lyrics:<br />
<br />
♫♫ Be passionate my friend<br />
Shine bright with the sun<br />
Dive into the blue sky<br />
And let summer take it all ♫♫<br />
<br />
And that is all there is to say about Grand Blue. It’s clear that not many people will agree with my statements as it appears to be a strong fan-favourite of whatever is left of the community still interested in seasonal anime. If you like it then I’m glad you enjoyed it, but there’s probably better comedies this season. Watch them; I thought this sucked. Grand Blue was the equivalent of a grand disaster in my eyes and stands a reminder that “in every age, in every place, the taste of weeaboos remain the same.” I guess I’m just not a fan of watching something akin to what the Fairy Tail guild would be like when knocked off their rocker. Anyways thank you to everyone who read my review. Be sure to leave a helpful if you liked-hell even if you disliked I’ll still take a helpful! Leave a comment for what I should review next. 99% unlikely to actually do it but who knows. Au revoir.<br />

    Grand Blue manga is the single most unfunny comedy series that is not Gintama. Naturally, when I heard it would be getting an anime adaptation from none less than Zero-G, I laughed like 7 minutes straight knowing how epic it would be. As expected, that was also the only funny thing related to this series.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
We don&#039;t have a story, but we have settings. Scuba diving. The funny part is that the series itself has practically nothing to do with scuba diving. The only thing that reminds even slightly of anything water-related, it is water boarding, as watching this is pure torture. The series is so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285478">
        bad I am surprised the UN has not banned it citing their human rights policies. <br />
<br />
The &quot;story&quot; centers around this nu-youngster party crew where all women are fanservice figures and men even worse. These folks are so bland and boring that they can&#039;t have fun without alcohol and being naked, so they drink it and party and act in disgusting ways that mainly look like the combination redneck orgies and hipsters trying out psychedelic drugs.<br />
<br />
I am not exaggerating the least. Every episode of this series starts with a banner/disclaimer stating how it does not promote underage drinking even though that&#039;s the main content of the entire series. It&#039;s beyond me how gore, raping, bullying and other dark and edgy stuff is so appalling to so many anime fans, yet this fking thing is acceptable. Drunken trash is already nauseating to watch, and drunken trash teenagers even more hideous. That&#039;s the real fucked up shit right there. The assumably comedic content with its in-your-face fanservice and sexual content is highly similar to Prison School except the irony was removed so everyone is just a slut or manslut. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Our cast is the worst part of the series. Iori&#039;s greatest merit is that he can appear in the series without wearing clothes. Chisa is your generic manhating mess who would be better fitting to Kuzu no Honkai than in any comedy series. Kouhei is the self-insert dude who is an otaku and does otaku stuff because he is otaku. Aina is so great no one even bothered to write her a biography. Azusa is this series progressive lesbian character who would be better off in Western industry and not in any anime. Kotobro is the best character because he doesn&#039;t have a personality so hating him is harder. Nanaka brings some more incest vibes because Chisa can&#039;t do everything on her own so that&#039;s cool. We also have a person named Shinji. If I forgot anyone, you can assume they also suck.<br />
<br />
Production:<br />
<br />
The art and animation go way below average medium quality. Not a single comedic scene stands out. Typical comedy effect are not used in any scenes. The voice acting is monotonous and bland. Nothing is pushed onward or polished. Perfect example of how bad everything in it is, is the very first comedy scene at 3 minutes mark into episode 01. This is your typical &quot;man walks into a bar&quot; gag, starting with mc wondering what type of people are behind  the door, opens the door and sees bunch of identical muscular boys playing janken and yelling some inaudible phrases (of course, being naked whilst doing so), followed by him getting on his knees cursing his life. I can think of at least 50 different ways on how this scene would have made me laugh, but I can&#039;t think of a single way how it would have left me with emptier expression. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
There is nothing I can recommend less than Grand Blue. I&#039;d hire a detective to find me where the fun in this series is supposed to be, but I am certain they would return without any leads.

    &quot;In Japan, the color blue signifies youth, a time of excitement and infinite possibilities&quot;<br />
<br />
Hello everyone , this is my review of funniest show of this season and one of the best gag comedy i had ever seen in anime ..<br />
so Lets begin<br />
<br />
Intro:<br />
<br />
Imagine what you expect when you going to college, we develop a lot of preconceptions about what it would be like i mean New places, new friends, maybe a new girlfriend. Go to some parties, maybe find somewhere I felt like I could really fit in and all that wonderful dreamy thought. Well our main protagonist Imagination is no different than an average student

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290269">
        who just entering the college.<br />
<br />
After graduating high school, Iori moves to Izu, on the coast, to go to college for mechanical engineering. “I’ll put all my effort into having the best college life possible!” he vows. “I’m going to meet cute girls, fall in love, and enjoy the pinnacle of youth with good friends!”<br />
<br />
He moves in with his uncle and, more importantly, his two beautiful cousins: motherly, long-haired Nanaka and tomboyish, short-haired Chisa. All of them work at the uncle’s dive shop, the Grand Blue; unfortunately, so do Tokita and Kotobuki, macho dive bums who pressure Iori into joining the diving club even though he can’t swim. Alas, Iori soon finds himself roped into their social circle, partying with a bunch of goofy jocks who just want to get naked and play all-male drinking games. Will Iori get to enjoy a cool campus life? Will he find love? Will the diving club ever actually get in the water? <br />
<br />
Well thats for the introduction part which sounds like an average college based anime <br />
or IS IT!, so let examine in our further review.<br />
<br />
Story: (7/10)<br />
<br />
Most of the time we see gag anime fail to deliver a proper story line and mostly involved in delivering some random funny events and scenes.<br />
Well Grand Blue is kind of done a decent job in constructing a story line. Sure we can say that its not a story based anime .However, Grand Blue does deserve credit in the sense that it doesn&#039;t completely devolve into comedy, as most events take place in a ocean setting, staying true to the foundation that it lay down. The Episodes are also loosely tied together, meaning that there is some degree of continuation. But in all we can say that its main purpose is to make audience laugh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art, Animation and sound:(9/10)<br />
<br />
Art is beautiful considering how they have utilize the beauty of locations including underwater and seasore and present it in a beautiful and artistic way. Animation is great, studio done a decent job in adapting manga considering manga artstyle is already top class we sure expect in the hands of a decent studio anime is pleasant to watch.<br />
There are some part i like to focus on which Grand Blue done a tremendous job that is adapting face expression with the scenes. Grand Blue Dreaming is a stunning treasure trove of reaction faces. With influences from hot-blooded fighting anime, horror movie framing, and direct references to other franchises, like this Great Teacher Onizuka and that Evil sarcastic Face which taken from Attack on Titans.<br />
OP and ending is pleasant and beautiful as well as some underwater scenes are eyecatching.<br />
<br />
It also done a great job in sound department including beautiful opening and ending sound. There are no characters who unnecessarily shouting everywhere and trying to make audience laugh .Voice actors done excellent job in providing tone which goes exceptionally well with the scene <br />
<br />
Characters:(9/10)<br />
Characters are unique and excellent and each have there own funnier side perfectly well fitted for such gags Anime.<br />
We can see from absolute scumbags to a hot and weird otaku , from a shy tomboyish waifu material girl who has its own sadist side to a lewd Onee san including Airheads and some trouble some senpais.<br />
Grand Blue has all to offer what is necessary for a gag anime, characters range from lovable bastards like club senpai Tokki and Bukki to absolute scumbags, with Iori somewhere in the middle. He has a veneer of respectability that gets shattered the moment he takes a sip of beer. Also our fellow dorks like good-looking but skeevy anime fan Kohei (“Why isn’t there a club full of beautiful high school girls to be my harem?”)<br />
The female character are more kind of average than you might expect from this particular strain of comedy, with the exception of Nanaka, who is pretty one note with the unpredictable and Lewd Azusa. Chisa and Aina for me is kind of okay serving as a balance in between all these crazy characters.<br />
<br />
So Whats Lacking:<br />
Well if you see the Manga, its clearly one of the best comedy manga ever made. For anime i feel it kind of fail to adapt the proper pacing of the Anime and how to give Focus on some particular scene. We can see same kind of thing with some famous anime like Food Wars (after 1st season) and Tokyo Ghoul. On some scenes and some part of the story it feel bit rushed which makes viewers who already familiar with manga kind of disappointed. Other than that i dont find anything which are lacklustre in the Anime.<br />
<br />
The Bad:<br />
The other element that might not work for everyone is all the nudity and fanservice. The most explicit nudity actually comes from the boys in the club, who tend to strip when they get drunk.<br />
The women, however, in their skintight wetsuits, bikinis, or the occasional glimpse of underwear, are clearly supposed to be titillating.<br />
Well i can say that its not for everyone who dont feel comfortable in such thing like nudity and drinkin<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
Grand Blue is fundamentally a frat house farce in the vein of something like American Pie or The Hangover in anime version. Its comedy definitely has lot of consistency when it comes to make people laugh. If you want a show who you can watch with your friends with enjoyment and laugh this show deliver all the things you needed. <br />
Funny events timing is impeccable, making great use of situations, and even manages to make repeating the same punchline funnier the second time.<br />
<br />
Overall its pretty good and satisfying show and definitely one of the best gag anime ever made also the funniest one but again you’ll have to really love booze jokes, funny faces, and gags about guys being caught naked with little censorship marks obscuring their junk.<br />

    (*Updated*) <br />
<br />
Grand Blue is an AMAZING MANGA and I highly recommend you guys to read the manga after you have watched episode 1 of the anime to get the voices in your head. Shifting away from the &quot;on how to watch&quot; (which is up to you), the adaptation is so far on point with the manga which makes me very happy! Within 4 episodes in, it looks like the format for each episode is going to cover 2 chapters of manga! This show is basically, If you like comedy such as Gintama, you will definitely love Grand Blue; a show about daily struggles of students

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285490">
        during their college life; a setting that is not often explored by anime.<br />
<br />
Story[8]; Without spoiling the story, the timeline is quite the same as Gintama&#039;s formatting their episodes. Not quite random, but random events that happens in unspecified, yet chronological timeline! That being said, Grand Blue&#039;s full of comedy including slapstick humor and exclusive college jokes that only college kids would understand! Perhaps a bit mature, but hell; Watch it! How would you experience anime without watching at least one episode huh? Do not skip on Grand Blue for sure!<br />
<br />
Art[8]; I mean with comedy genre of anime, the animation/art is sometimes replaced by how much you laugh, but the art is okay or good enough to an average anime viewer. Unless you are elitist... everyone knows that art does not correlate to quality/enjoyment of the anime such as Ping Pong the animation. The animators are trying their best to adapt art style from manga which it most part it does, yet people just like to nitpick on the smallest pixel. The Animation is NOWHERE NEAR BAD!<br />
<br />
Sound[10]; Opening is very catchy and it gives out this &quot;dive vibe&quot; and the ending song has this &quot;closure vibe &quot; that, in my mind, represents the great laughter, joy, and sadness , waiting for the new episode patiently. Voice actors, in this show, must be mentioned because they have to put so much energy for so many scenes that requires: screaming out of lungs, playing serious in a stupid act, and playing the straight man of course. It&#039;s not easy to voice act, but they have some very familiar voice actors that fits very well with each character.<br />
<br />
Character[10]; Well, if you know your comedy with Gintama then you have heard the character type, the &quot;straight man&quot;. Grand Blue basically formulates around a straight man with bunch of casts who are out of his/her &quot;norms&quot; that creates a ripple of unexpected events which are mainly comedic and i love it! And when you do such format you have to have some really original/funny/unique characters and ohh boy do they have it. Of course all of these characters are above the legal ages and attending college which makes these character more relatable to young adults such as me. You have the vast cast ranging from an Handsome stereotype who is an otaku, muscular alcoholics, the newcomer stereotypical MC that has high hopes on his new college life that ends up with the muscular alcoholics and starting to migrate to their new culture, and the cousin who hates the MC for being a dumbass for migrating to alcoholism, yet this is the few introducing characters in the anime; there will be much more awesome characters incoming later episodes that gives the show more color. The Characters interactions are the main seller of this show. Don&#039;t let other people tell you how the characters act in this show as dumb or stupid because, in my case, college students really do act similarly like the casts in Grand Blue! <br />
<br />
Enjoyment[10]; This show is not for the weak or who do not get the college life... So it&#039;s not for everyone as the anime and manga&#039;s target audience are young adults or people who have experienced college. Of course outliers can enjoy this slapstick humor too. To give an example on how the anime represents the college life; a reference of different types of characters during an exam that have not studied for, showing their struggles within college classes which perfectly relates to students in real life college who failed or struggled with an exam(s) that professor made it absolutely impossible. There will be much more similar silly events around the theme of college life. All of those silly events are just comedic gold; ironically, very much like college! This show is already my most favorite anime of this year so far and deserve much more love. <br />
<br />
Overall[10]; Grand Blue is not for everyone, but it does deliver the college type of feel and I kinda skipped the part about diving in this review. Let&#039;s be honest.. this anime might look like about diving, but it&#039;s mostly focused on character interactions and how you should view your life as student in college. Animation are very nicely done and can be wonky at times, but that shouldn&#039;t really stop you from watching it. This show is a must try for this season! If you are a college student or you just love comedy, this show is for you!<br />
<br />
Updated Opinion; I have been following the community opinion on the Anime adaptation vs the manga and they are some key notes to be considered: Age of characters have been changed for legal purposes, some of the atmosphere is not the same as in manga and some events got changed due to time constraints. With the release of the 4th episode; this episode has been proven me that the anime has done justice on adapting from the manga chapters 7-8! The characters are consistent just as in the manga. Cannot wait for the new episode! People who like to complain and consider themselves as &quot;Maestro Of Art Critique&quot;, they are definitely watching the wrong anime because like I said; Grand Blue is not for the weak!

    Entertaining Comedy?✓ Men who can&#039;t help but get drunk and strip?✓ Awkward Virgin friends?✓ Misunderstandings?✓<br />
<br />
Grand Blue is one of the funniest anime I have seen in a while. In a full on comedy anime, a plot is probably one of the least important aspects. To me, a comedy anime is all about the enjoyable characters and overall entertainment. And Grand Blue has all of those.<br />
<br />
Like most comedy anime, it operates with a very basic story- a college freshman being all excited to have a great college life.<br />
However, it doesn&#039;t go as planned when he&#039;s forced to join a &quot;diving club&quot;, in which the members drink

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290265">
        and strip more than dive (there still is diving I assure you). Yes, it&#039;s pretty ridiculous already, but it gets even better as the show progresses and more characters get introduced. <br />
<br />
The characters are the life of any comedy anime. Without fun, fitting characters, a comedy anime just won&#039;t be the same. It doesn&#039;t matter to me if they seem slightly generic, as long as they show some personality and entertain.<br />
Grand Blue has a good variety of different personalities which compliment each other perfectly to create hilarious exchanges. Whether it is a dumb, over the top MC, or an otaku &quot;ikemen&quot;, or awkward virgin friends, or men (and women) who couldn&#039;t care less about getting drunk and stripping in public, Grand Blue has a good variety to keep the entertainment going.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is also top notch, and paired with some incredible facial expressions, all the characters are funny in their own right. Honestly, the facial expressions are some of the most hilarious ones I&#039;ve seen since Prison School. <br />
<br />
There are many comedy anime out there which can have some funny episodes while the rest are a hit-and-miss. Grand Blue, however is very consistent in that regard. Honestly, comedy will always be a subjective genre. Grand Blue might not be for some, but those who enjoy a rather over-the-top comedy anime should definitely give this a shot.<br />

    Grand Blue so far is a hilarious anime for this season. The start of the first episode makes the anime seem like a generic boy moving to a new town for a fresh and new start. But lo and behold, he opens the doors to see..... NAKED MUSCULAR MEN. <br />
<br />
It has a distinct art style that brings out more comedic effect at times, but the art is not anything ground-breaking, kind of normal and standard.<br />
<br />
The music is okay, I actually really like the OP song, gives off modern EDM westerinized vibes. <br />
<br />
I love the characters, none of them are very annoying and all have their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285486">
        own unique and funny quirks. <br />
<br />
Overall, I would say that this show is definitly worth a watch if you want something funny to watch this season. Even if you aren&#039;t looking for a funny comedy, it is still worth a try!

    This is one of the most boring and unfunny shows that I&#039;ve ever seen in my life.  <br />
<br />
Our main character moves into his uncle&#039;s diving shop, Grand Blue where he met almost all of the cast. I expected to find creative jokes and interesting characters but I was very disappointed. <br />
<br />
The show barely try doing something new and becomes repetitive easily. The predominant jokes are: naked guys drinking, Kouhei and Iori fighting, forced misunderstanding and, to a lesser extent, Iori&#039;s friends harassing fellow virgin friends. I don&#039;t have any problems with this type of jokes (except the last one) but they are introduced so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290289">
        many times in a short time. Honestly, it&#039;s a little annoying. The worst part is that the show almost never try to have a cohesive pacing with the jokes.<br />
<br />
The characters didn&#039;t help either. Along with the 95% of the jokes, they are generic and one-dimensional. Most of the girls (Azusa and Nanaka) are just fanservice figures while that the guys only exist for the sake of the naked joke (Shinji and Ryuujirou). The rest of them are more independent of the generic jokes but they&#039;re eclipsed by them. Chisa is a generic angry girl/cousin, Kouhei is the self-insert character, Iori changes his personality depending of the joke, and Aina, despite that falls in the category of shy girl, have some personality and she&#039;s the only decent character in the entire show. <br />
<br />
The story is quite simple and linear. Is easy to follow.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, Grand Blue has good moments about diving that were well handled by the studio but they barely appear and with the unfunny jokes in the middle is hardly enjoyable. <br />
<br />
The animation is mostly good and the opening is amazing. On the other hand, OST is forgettable.<br />
<br />
Some people are saying that the manga is better but, here, I&#039;m just talking about the anime version. I never understood why Grand Blue receives so much admiration. Basically, I was bored to death. If you are looking for a very good comedy, I recommend you to watch Asobi Asobase.<br />

    Grand Blue is a comedy that transverses the humor between the peaceful as a disguise (in the beginning) and soon after it becomes a chatterbox and screaming with excessive sexual connotations and alcoholic drinks, but it has positive points about knowledge about the sea and diving. (not many)<br />
<br />
The lessons learned in this &quot;book&quot;&quot; are specifications about how to dive, use of equipment, and few connotations about peaceful nature, such as marine animals.<br />
<br />
The plot follows Iori Kitahara entering his college and going to stay at his uncle&#039;s dive shop, and, like every teenager going into adulthood, he is a character who only wants beautiful girls and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404510">
        sex and is of little importance for studying even when he goes to college. Arriving at the store Iori hopes to find this magnificent dream of his, and to her surprise he finds a bunch of &#039;&#039;very masculine, muscular and naked men&#039; who dive and make a mess with screams, alcoholic drinks and sexual jokes.<br />
<br />
Apart from Iori, we have two more main characters (apart from Aina Yoshiwara who for me is not), Kouhei Imamura and Chisa Kotegawa.<br />
<br />
Iori and Kouhei&#039;s relationship is based on the two having the same goals, and in this they join the mess of &#039;&#039;Well masculine, muscular and naked men&#039;&#039; and drink all the time and are naked by the psychological change of alcoholism assimilating to the others, while Chisa just watches them with a look of disgust and contempt - She, who resembles a scholar who cares about her future, being Iori&#039;s cousin and for whom she seems to have feelings deep down and so does he (which is gross because they are cousins, and also because these feelings seem insignificant and non-existent) as their relationship style does not match the apparent outcome.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve never seen and don&#039;t see any future for Grand Blue, being a work that demonstrates a reality that I hate with all my strength, that from the adolescent stage to the post-teenager leaning towards adulthood, showing us and also influencing us to become like the typical crowd who hear loud sounds (like funk dances in the country where I live), drink, smoke, do drugs, have sex all the time and use despicable language, which ended up destroying any chance of the existential human collective of the line of evolution from the 21st century onwards.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading and see you next time.

    Funniest, hilarious, rolling on the floor laughing....<br />
It is the funniest anime I&#039;ve ever watched. And no one even came close to the laughter this series gave me. Now the other comedy series like saitama, konosuba, haganai, arakawa under the bridge, bungou stray dogs... Doesn&#039;t even compare to it. Female charecter are normal (except one , but that gives a spice to the females) and no one in the boys is normal... The face they make can make you die laughing, the ideas of boys.... Everything about boys is depicted in a hilarious way. <br />
<br />
I can say by no doubts, it is the funniest anime ever

    The comedy is average at best, it did not make me laugh. Some of the stuff it has is generic. I mean character getting misunderstanding about other have sexual relation has been done countless times in other anime and it a better way.<br />
<br />
They keep showing us naked guys in every episode multiple times. Repeating the same shit over and over again does not make it more funny.<br />
<br />
It has no story/plot based on the 4 episodes I&#039;ve seen so far<br />
<br />
Females character wearing bikini is the only good thing about it so far. I hope Chisa get more screen time in future episodes than that idiotic male

          <span style="display: none;" id="review286119">
        MC<br />
<br />
Overall, the anime is mediocre at best so far. It is not so bad, but not good either. There is better comedy in this season Hataraku Saibou which is also an educational anime that teach you about cells and biology

    I was in a phase where i was watching a lot of trash 12 eps anime. I had lost almost all my enjoyment, but i couldn&#039;t stop from watching more trash anime. Then, one day, somebody told me to watch Grand Blue. I tought it was one more trash anime, but it was like an illumination... <br />
<br />
I actually laughed.<br />
I actually enjoyed my time.<br />
It actually changed my life.<br />
<br />
I gave Grand Blue such a high note because it was one of the most funny things i ever watched. Even if they repeated the joke, it was still very funny.

    Grand Blue is a Zero-G comedic anime from last year. I can&#039;t speak to the quality of their work in general since I only found thirteen titles listed for them and haven&#039;t seen any of them. It&#039;s based off of a manga by Inoue Kenji. Well, I like a lot of slice of life comedies so this may be relevant to my interests. Let&#039;s take a look. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Our protagonist is Kitahara Iori. A young man who moves into his Uncle&#039;s place while attending college. Once there, he&#039;s immediately marked by the diving club, which is made up largely of drunken morons who can&#039;t keep their clothes on.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301029">
        They coerce him into joining, sensing a kindred spirit. The series basically covers Iori&#039;s exploits and club activities. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the massive, gaping issue with the series. It isn&#039;t funny. For the vast majority of it, we just watch these drunken idiots act like drunken idiots. It&#039;s like watching that group you always avoided at University very closely and that&#039;s just annoying. There&#039;s a reason you avoid the intellectual shrimps who just want to party in a loud, obnoxious fashion. Another thing the series seems to find absolutely hilarious is giving the characters stupid looking, exaggerated features. Which kind of contributes to the generally annoying atmosphere. Then we have the humour that centers around Nanaka wanting to sex up her sister. It&#039;s like the worst part of Yuru Yuri, except the rest of the humour is on par with it. <br />
<br />
Actually, any time this series touches on the idea of romance it&#039;s horrible in some way. Whether it&#039;s Iori getting caught being pervy towards one of his cousins, the aforementioned sister complex, the group of incels or the bisexual fan-service girl. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Another big problem with the series as a whole is that the characters are all horrible. You pretty much hate 95% of them within minutes of them showing up and they don&#039;t even have the defence of being well written characters. They&#039;re very shallow. Unfortunately, they&#039;re shallow in a way that makes them incredibly unbearable. <br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;m not saying you need characters who are amicable for a comedy to work. The BBC&#039;s Black Adder serves as proof positive that you can have characters who are terrible people in a comedy and make it work really well. But that series has the benefit of clever writing and the writers made the titular character a charming rogue in every series save one. That factor, coupled with the cunning behind his actions does make him both interesting and funny. This series doesn&#039;t have any cleverness or charm to speak of. Which just makes the awful characters a slog to deal with. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
This is the one element where I can give the series some credit. The underwater scenes where we don&#039;t have insipid dialogue, shite facial expressions or any garbage character interactions to deal with can look very nice. If this series were just the seven or eight minutes of underwater scenery, I could enjoy it somewhat. <br />
<br />
Of course, it does have issues with really stupid looking facial expressions popping up constantly and the characters randomly taking off their clothes because Inoue apparently finds nudity to be the funniest thing of all time. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
While Grand Blue does have some talented voice actors, it&#039;s also one of those series where they aren&#039;t allowed to have good performances. The dialogue is so over-exaggerated and the characters are so devoid of anything resembling complexity that it becomes nearly as annoying to listen to as it is to watch. The music is, at least, only sub-par. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
We have Nanaka with her romantic feelings towards her own sister. We also have Azusa, who is openly bisexual. The series also loves to make jokes in poor taste about people mistaking Iori for having romantic feelings towards his otaku friend. <br />
<br />
Areas of Improvement:<br />
<br />
Having clever jokes instead of loud, obnoxious unfunny ones. <br />
There is literally no benefit to the nudity, just have your characters keep their clothes on. <br />
Just say no to the incest. At best, it&#039;s cringey and mildly unpleasant. At worst, it&#039;s fecking terrible. <br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
This is easily among the worst comedies I&#039;ve ever seen. It tries to force humour out of being loud and obnoxious but, ultimately, all that does is make it loud and obnoxious. You hate the characters pretty much within minutes of them showing up. The actors are wasted since you could just replace their lines with a crying baby and it would only be mildly more annoying. Ultimately, it&#039;s just an unpleasant, horribly written and devoid of humour work. I&#039;m giving it a 2/10 and it only gets that high of a score because of the nice underwater scenery. If you really find drunken idiots charming, it may be the series for you. Otherwise, I&#039;d suggest staying away from it.

    Let&#039;s cut right to the chase: should you watch this show?<br />
<br />
Hell Yes.<br />
<br />
Grand Blue is the first anime in a while that has centered its story around the college life (last I have seen being Golden Time), but with this time, it embraces the partying aspect of it... a lot. It is a show with a really awesome cast that all interact in different and funny ways with each other, making for some seriously hilarious jokes throughout the show. Seriously, I&#039;ve almost died of laughter from this show many times. <br />
<br />
While Grand Blue is a comedy, its storytelling is also decent, as we learn how serious

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285575">
        diving actually is from the supporting cast, and the beauty it can entail as well. <br />
<br />
Overall, Grand Blue is just a stellar anime and a perfect cleansing anime after a long day&#039;s work.

    I tried to see what the fuss about is with this show and I have never been so disappointed by such an ironically unfunny comedy. I couldn&#039;t even get past the five first episodes because of how utterly pathetic the men are in this show. The type of humor that this show tried to present just didn&#039;t sit well with me. It&#039;s an attempt at humor that only straight, sexist boys will find funny. I understand that this is categorized as seinen, but as I&#039;ve said, the humor in this is lost to me. The only redeeming factor of this show is the animation.<br />
<br />
I highly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292823">

    &quot;This is a diving anime... Yes.. Grand Blue is indeed a diving anime only.&quot; - Typical Grand Blue audience.<br />
<br />
When you look at the comedy industry of anime, it is always topping-off the reviews, charts and everything. Why? Because either it has a good story with ton of great jokes, or the show is just very riduculous and have great humour. If you notice it, comedic anime are mostly in the school genre (specifically High School) which make sense because teenagers often goof up on school unlike adults who focuses on their life more. Then here we have Grand Blue, that is not a high school

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290274">
        anime but college instead. Grand Blue is one of many comedy anime out there this Summer 2018 that offers us laughter that can relate to college students out there. And for some reason this anime offers diving (I guess) which I don&#039;t see pretty much often on anime (except swimming anime).<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Grand Blue&#039;s story is not really chronological and like I said on my other reviews on other comedy anime, it doesn&#039;t matter whether it is chronological or not as long as it stays on point to the humor and characters. We have here Kitahara, Iori who will move to his uncle&#039;s diving shop as his home in college. Seems normal isn&#039;t it? Thats where you are wrong. The diving shop have tons of ridiculous, weird and extreme practices including naked Rock-Paper-Scissors and drinking alcohol while your naked is COMPLETELY normal on this shop (Heck, even the owner which is Iori&#039;s uncle likes to get naked and used to it.).Then there&#039;s the university where he attends to which have variety of characters ranging from an otaku, crazy upperclassmen, charismatic boys from the tennis club and those typical friends you get who are all virgins. Grand Blue is a show where the MC is not really treated as an MC. Each character have unique comedic traits that can contribute to the story in whole. Whether the character is an otaku or not, they can make the story humorous alot. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
The characters of Grand Blue is what makes Grand Blue one of the best comedy shows this season. If not maybe the best comedy this year as well. We have the main protagonists Kotegawa Chisa, who is a bit of a tsundere-type of girl and have so much love on diving. There&#039;s Kitahara Iori, who is the main attraction of all and probably a failure of a kind of college student. He is those characters that can adapt into any environment whether it is an environment full of titan-like men drinking alcohol or the under the sea environment. There&#039;s Imamura Kouhei who is the otaku of the diving club and the &quot;rival&quot; of Iori (There rivalry is actually very funny. Not those types of rivalry like Naruto and Sasuke.) and Yoshiwara Aina, who for some reason has the same attitude of Iori when he first entered the shop and she is probably the most normal one out of all the characters. This four for some reason are considered the main characters on MAL but in the anime, the other characters are almost treated as main ones as well. I say this because on every humour, its not only this four characters are contributing to it. The supporting ones holds the joke as well and thats what makes Grand Blue an anime that treats all the characters equally for the comedy and story.<br />
For example, the two naked titans Kotobuki Ryuujirou and Tokita Shinji are the two characters that have weird but funny sense of ways of drinking alcohol with friends. Hamaoka Azusa, who is the only girl character in the anime that likes getting along with the guys (and Mr. Alcohol) and sometimes she even gets to the enthusiasm of being naked (not completely). Also she loves both yaoi and yuri and this trait makes Iori and Azusa&#039;s relation to one another funny as well as Iori have to bear with it since he is not a fan of any of those two. Then, the sister of Chisa which is Kotegawa Nanaka, who have a big secret towards Chisa and possessiveness towards her. Not to mention the other characters like the friends of Iori and Kouhei at the university each gave way for more comedic scenes to the anime. That is why Grand Blue was funny as hell because their traits as well as some misunderstanding towards one another make it even more funny. They are all perfectly synchronize even though they are different characters.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
I can&#039;t stress out how the art and visuals of Grand Blue is stunning, funny and amazing at the same time. From the looks of their faces due to some scenes either shockness or anger, to the normal visual scenes and the underwater sea, Grand Blue tells you that this is not just a comedy show full of great humourous scenes but it also have eye-appealing scenes as well visuals of the characters and environment.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
If you take a look of the openings of the anime that aired this Summer season, Grand Blue is the only comedy show plus not a sports anime that has such a good opening that reflects on summer (correct me if Im wrong here.) this season and seeing the opening with all the diving and the hidden wonders of the sea is just so pleasant and beautiful. Plus it is actually a click bait of an opening as the opening just reflected the diving parts of the anime but not the humors and drinking of it. The ending of the anime however reflects how absurd, weird and funny the anime is (opposite to the ending) where we saw Iori seeing into some Karaoke and after he finished the song the other 3 males and him gets naked. Pretty absurd right? I have no problems of the background music or anything that is related to the sound system throughout the episodes as well.<br />
<br />
Overall thoughts and Enjoyment:<br />
As you can see with my rating of this show, I totally enjoyed it. It is one of those anime this season that when you have a bad day or in a bad mood, just watch this show and you will be dying of laughter and releases your stress of anything. That&#039;s what makes comedy shows great in the anime industry and Grand Blue is one of it.<br />

    - It&#039;s a very light and fun anime, the episodes end and you don&#039;t even notice. The jokes and situations are great and at many times you laugh a lot.<br />
- The characters are college students, drink a lot and go to parties, which I thought was very similar to the real life of a college student, which is not much discussed in anime.<br />
- Anime has little romance, but it is interesting and makes funny situations happen.<br />
- In short, it is an anime that perfectly fulfills its role, which is to be a comedy. It is very funny and fun, worth seeing.

    Amazing show, comedy is great and story moves fast<br />
I like all the characters and I think they were given enough spotlight <br />
College life was well shown (without studying of course as in 95% of anime)<br />
Soundtrack is good, animation is good and references from other shows were very well put in the jokes <br />
I like that there was representation for every character troupe all of them were done right at least in my opinion<br />
I think this anime deserves higher rating and more love then or at least close to other anime like Kaguya sama or Devil is a Part timer <br />

    this anime was supposed to be funny right ?, i was supposed to laugh while i watch it right ? because i didn&#039;t.<br />
all i saw is repeated jokes with naked men drinking all day and make ugly faces, and they focus on the last one enough to annoy me. i couldn&#039;t finish it, i didn&#039;t expect that it will make me laugh as gintama did but it was worst than i expected. <br />
i don&#039;t have many things to add on this review but all i can say is that this anime has no plot, the characters aren&#039;t funny at all they just act crazy, they

    &quot;Grand blue is like a drug at first you only use it a bit, but then you get addicted and can&#039;t think of anything else&quot;<br />
<br />
At first the anime might seem like a boring and slow one, but once you get through first two episodes then it gets a lot funnier. You will get addicted. I literally couldn&#039;t stop laughing in any of the episodes. But you have to like just the right kind of humor to like this one.<br />
<br />
Some people might not like the expressions characters make sometimes but I find it hilarious.<br />
<br />
Watch this serie if you want to have a blast. <br />
