    It&#039;s hard not to see why Miss Kobayashi&#039;s Dragon Maid has a strong, peculiar fanbase from years past. Made by the fact that for one, this was Cool-kyou Shinja&#039;s way of introducing us into the world where dragons once were at war. And one of them (Tohru) snuck out into the human realm, where her encounter with this drunken woman (Kobayashi) changed the perception of the relationship between humans and dragons, so much so that other dragons thereafter (Kanna, Lucoa, Elma and Fafnir) followed suit and became the apartment community that we all know and love.<br />
<br />
The other fact is because of one of the crème

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417800">
        de la crème animation studios that is well-beloved by fans in the anime industry: Kyoto Animation (or KyoAni for short). May I formally remind everyone of the tragedy that is KyoAni&#039;s mid-2019 arson attack that struck and stunned the world to its knees, being one of the worst post-World War 2 attacks, and losing valuable staff such as Season 1&#039;s director Yasuhiro Takemoto who has been a KyoAni veteran mainstay since 1996. For that sense, Season 2 paying respects by crediting and immortalizing his name as &quot;Series Director&quot; is a well-deserved sendoff to a legend. RIP Yasuhiro Takemoto.<br />
<br />
That said, since we already know much about Dragon Maid, what&#039;s there left to say about it, other than this being the 2nd of 3 Cool-kyou Shinja&#039;s works in the Summer season, repeating the usual daily antics of Tohru, Kobayashi and the rest of the characters? More than KyoAni rising up from the ashes once again with new staff joining onboard, it&#039;s the arrival of another dragon: the Gigantomachia voluptuous size-breasted fire-breathing Chaos Dragon girl Ilulu to rock the scene, continuing what Dragon Maid has done best with its fantastical slice-of-life comedy. VA Tomomi Mineuchi voicing this dangerous, busty dragon who&#039;s got her mentality set impaired from the influence of other Chaos Dragons with their beliefs that humans and dragons cannot co-exist with one another from young, especially from the fact that her parents were exterminated by humans. And oh boy, if there was someone worth saving ears and eyes from bad influence, it&#039;s Ilulu, because as much as human interaction she&#039;d have some experience having fun of, it&#039;s ultimately at the hands of non-sensible adults that spoil the childrens&#039; mindset that gave way to building Ilulu&#039;s desperation for world destruction. As such, it&#039;s thanks to both Tohru and Kobayashi for pointing fingers and protecting this kid dragon who deserves to live a second chance to live the normal life like Tohru and the other dragons do...and secretly steal Tohru&#039;s place for Kobayashi&#039;s closeness of affection.<br />
<br />
Believe me, Season 2 might feel the same as Season 1, but the story and plot, as much as it is a slice-of-life series, is vastly improved for the most part. The secret to the dragons and their never-ending war between factions to fight between achieving Chaos or Harmony, as well as Ilulu&#039;s constant development to be a better and senseful dragon living alongside Kobayashi, Tohru and Kanna in the same old apartment, never gets old. With new adventures from Kanna and Ilulu&#039;s part of their own endeavours, as much as some old feud flames between Tohru and Elma, Season 2 opens up the floodgates for more character interaction that is largely the same since the prequel. Both Takiya and Fafnir are forever Otaku lovers, while Kanna is the constant love interest affection of deredere Saikawa&#039;s with loveshots beaming at even the slightest contact. Oh, and I mustn&#039;t forget that Shouta has adapted well to Lucoa&#039;s antics (while being surprised every now and then), and last but not least, the teeny hidden bit of affection from Take to Ilulu.<br />
<br />
From hindsight, fans of KyoAni would&#039;ve been less optimistic that after the horrible tragedy, works that are in production that are left on-hold would not be possible to be continued. And that these works would take years before their eventual release to cope with the loss of many notable, valuable and talented staff, young and old alike. But here we are, 2 years (from the time of this review) after the fateful tragedy that KyoAni has came back strong and better than ever. Season 2 amps up KyoAni&#039;s production values, giving more flare to flex with both the visuals and animation that are a step up from Season 1, made in no small part from the replacement that is another KyoAni legend director Tatsuya Ishihara, who has directed Haruhi Suzumiya and Clannad to name a few of the most notable favourites, along with Season 1 staff coming back to helm this sequel. KyoAni has seen better days, and those better days have returned to come back with a vengeance.<br />
<br />
As much as I would want to like the goodness that is fhána&#039;s 2nd OP of Dragon Maid, Season 1&#039;s &quot;chu chu yeah~&quot; of a damn catchy intro beat really just immortalizes the series as a whole in a far better light. This is as close to a mountain peak&#039;s equivalent of a virtually untoppable OP if you ask people what is the first thing they remember about Dragon Maid. The ED is a whole lot better than Season 1&#039;s as far as I remember, because there&#039;s not only the addition of Ilulu into the band of dragons that makes for such a cute song, but also the anime MV (which is up on Lantis&#039;s YouTube channel) which sees the VAs reprise their characters in cosplay, having all that fun and jazz. <br />
<br />
Overall, Season 2 puts the prequel to shame in all aspects, but that&#039;s not to say that Season 1 is bad, not at all. If anything, the prequel laid the groundwork for yet another amaze-balls season of Dragon Maid, and we&#039;re blessed with one of many KyoAni&#039;s resurgent works, so much so that watching Dragon Maid for its second inning brings out the kid in us once again. This is the success story of KyoAni&#039;s return to form, and Cool-kyou Shinja&#039;s beloved series leads that charge with increasing popularity that ages like fine wine.<br />
<br />
Gotta have more of Maid Dragon, and help children be led the right way to live, uphold and watch over their growth like Kobayashi&#039;s to Ilulu. If there is a lesson to be learnt in this sequel, it&#039;s this: &quot;Teach Your Children Well&quot;.

    There is a misconception about how to treat this anime as a viewer. Many people fall into the disgrace of just awarding its superficial characteristics, maybe because they are appealing for a vast part of the community. The reality is that Dragon Maid is not just its colourful palette and huge milkers, it is not exclusively a eye candy to enjoy the beautiful designs of its characters and their apparently insane way of being, Dragon Maid signifies one of a hell unique experience that mix the peak of the japanese animation standards while mixing it with some well thought building of its elements.<br />
<br />
First of all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410484">
        I&#039;m not going to say that KyoAni hasnt done a good job with this second season. Indeed, I think that the animation, art and design is as good as it have been with the first season. Fluid animation, well done motions, it spreads a living colourful experience that creates an ambience that is eloquent with the own story and it translates the feelings told by the story to the viewer through the eyes and the ears in a magnificient way. The point is, that is what we expect from them at this point. Anything less than this would be a degrade of quality, they are just that great. Then, how can we evaluate something that good in that apartment?<br />
<br />
To do so we have to evaluate the goals of this anime in its story. This is a Comedy, SoL and Fantasy. One could be unwise and say that the sole purpose of this anime is to convey a wholesome comedy, but the good thing is that it works even it is just that! The comedy is amusing. You have running gags that have been building from the last season and still works, they work because the characters nature conveys a reasonable excuse to them to exist in the first place. There is no external force that drives the comedy, the comedy is a endogenous characteristic of the own nature of the story and the consequences that have been molded through the presentation of the characters. To be specific to this season, in this case any comedy act of Ilulu is masterfully created by her own way of growing up, and how she actually perceives the human race.<br />
<br />
Then, why is that foolish to just say that this is a wholesome comedy? There is a deeper act going on. The concept of the juxtaposition from characters from another world into this world, and the critiques and moral concepts that arise from them are masterfully done. The fact that many people cant look past the tits, lolis and shotas relationships that are actually a huge reference, is a landmark about how this anime does this in such a proficient way. It is not on your nose, you have to actually pay attention and interpret the whole worldbuilding that have been presented throughout this and the past season to really get and click the point of this. Topics like mutual respect, importance of honesty, living your own life, understanding the other and being aware of your own actions are camouflaged behind the blurred lines of comedy. Attacks to the exploitative working force, references and understanding about our way of living and proper reflexion of it through the usage of the dragons are always the focal point of the comedy. The characters relationships and how they mold the perspective of the viewer and the understanding of the feelings of all characters is perfect. And, as I said, it is not on the nose, which makes the whole experience way more gratifying, you are not being taught those, you can perceive this anime as both as a wholesome experience and as an analysis of our own way of living.<br />
<br />
That is why for me this anime is a 10 this season, because it continues this act of beauty. The Saikawa-Kanna relationship is still there, the great contrast of Elma is still there, Lucoa is given even more colour and Tooru is as great as ever. Ilulu as a character is still not completely done, for sure as we can tell by the OP, but what we have seen yet is perfect. The way to convey your prospect way of living, the importance of respect to the children and the concept of regret and how it affects our way of thinking and living is perfect, cant ask for more yet.

    Kobayashi, Tohru, and friends return for a second season that’s every bit as entertaining, raunchy, and heartfelt as the first.<br />
<br />
Tohru and Kobayashi go through some changes, and they gain a new family member. Tohru’s character arc continues, and it’s interwoven with Elma’s arc. Both have to confront their past as enemies with very different values and worldviews. They dedicate plenty of airtime to painting a picture of their lives before they came to Japan. Facilitating their character development is Kobayashi. She remains the core of the found-family dynamic as the father figure to Kanna and now the new character, Ilulu. Fafnir and his roommate/boyfriend Takiya

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417806">
        returned in a few vignettes. His dry sense of humor mixed with Takiya’s exaggerated gamer persona is still a lot of fun to watch. Ilulu, a rather obnoxious dragon girl, enters the picture to fight Tohru in the first episode and integrates into society as a human with some difficulty. <br />
<br />
Rather than a continuous plotline, the show breaks itself into vignettes that follow one to three characters at a time. The structure directly comes from the gag comedy manga, and it works to varying degrees of success. We can label specific segments as slice-of-life, but others have plenty of exciting action and drama to amp the stakes. There’s a relaxing effect Dragon Maid has on its viewers. Even the artists draw every character as adorable as possible; the dialogue feels casual, not forced. There’s no babbling babies or overly saccharine one-liners like moe anime have come to make us expect. <br />
<br />
When it needs to get serious, it works. The storyboards emphasize the characters’ emotional state with clever use of lighting and framing. There is no shortage of visual metaphors we’ve come to expect from the late great director of the first season: Yasuhiro Takemoto. Another director had to take up the mantle early in production, and his work is solid. Every fight scene is a visually appealing spectacle. There are plenty of ferocious duels in the second season that left me in awe. From the booming orchestral pieces to the subtle acoustic guitars, the soundtrack adds emotional impact to every scene. Additionally, the opening and ending themes are as iconic as the originals. Ai no Supreme is such a catchy intro that it makes you want to sing along.<br />
<br />
The world of Dragon Maid feels lived in; the characters react to their surroundings in natural ways. That may sound abstract, but that is how I can describe it. This show feels genuine—a lot of that has to do with the realistic ambient sound effects and vivid background art. Kobayashi’s apartment is an excellent example of this: personalized decorations, posters, and organized messes are scattered around. It fits her personality to a T. Watching Tohru become more involved in society and form a community is immensely satisfying. Such as in one of the funniest skits, she works at a maid cafe and imparts dark magic knowledge onto the staff. <br />
<br />
And then, she showed up—Ilulu is probably the worst part of Dragon Maid (except for the children pinning each other down in the first season). Guys, let’s be reasonable. She is sus. Ilulu has the arms and legs of a toddler but with giant tits. Boobs are great, but that’s not really the issue; she just looked very weird at times. Despite her bazongas, she talks, looks, and acts like a child, hanging around with Kanna and her other grade school friends. But there’s also a running gag that she wants to have sex with Kobayashi; this leads to Tohru becoming jealous in a stale love-duel sort of situation. But it’s just not funny at all. That aside, Tohru and Kobayashi&#039;s lesbian relationship progresses even more as they overcome challenges together. This culminates in one of the show&#039;s best scenes in the season finale.<br />
<br />
In one early episode, Ilulu casts a spell to make Kobayashi spontaneously grow a dick. I’m not sure what the joke here was supposed to be. She also got horny for Tohru AND Kanna, implying it was normal because that’s just what happens when you have a penis. The author referred to her as a man as soon as she got a dick. Aside from being a reactionary belief that has no business in a wholesome show, it is just a factually untrue statement. It was like I witnessed the author’s search history and saw all kinds of hentai tags that do not belong in a big-budget anime. It’s a shame because Ilulu has sincerely good development once we learn her backstory. The dick joke was a one-and-done thing, so I don’t want to make it seem like a big deal.<br />
<br />
There were plenty of funny reaction faces and boisterous voice performances that got a laugh out of me. It’s practically a meme generator of a show. There were a few other jokes that got a little stale. Kanna’s nonchalant attitude towards Saikawa’s crush on her was funny at first, but it kept happening, and the gag never evolved. We get it—you like the girl. Please calm down! Additionally, that time Tohru drugged Kobayashi to make her want to have sex was pretty egregious. Lucoa, the busty goddess, continues to tease Shota. It was nice to see him grow as a mage, but I’m not a fan of the giant woman x little boy fanservice. I’m not judging anyone who likes that sort of thing. <br />
<br />
Overall it isn’t as laugh-out-loud as the first season, but it got a few chuckles out of me. Elma’s gluttony, Tohru’s struggle to get Kobayashi to eat her tail, and Kanna’s deadpan reaction to all manner of absurdities. Occasionally I was worried that this franchise was stretching itself thin—the multitude of heartfelt dramatic story beats dispelled those concerns. Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid S is built on genuine themes of family, friendship, and, additionally, atonement. For better or worse (mostly better), I loved seeing these characters again. After the devastating tragedy at Kyoto animation’s studio 1 in 2019, it is awe-inspiring how they’ve come back in full form. I look forward to every Dragon Maid sequel they come out with next.

    Four years ago, if you told me Season 2 of Kobayashi was somehow even better than the first, I would’ve thought you’re crazy, especially with a Kyoto Animation that no longer has Yamada OR Takemoto! I mean, Season 1 was pretty much perfect in every way, and I thought themes were already so well-explored that there’s no way a sequel could live up to that quality. Boy, was I wrong, because Miss Kobayashi’s Maid Dragon S blew me away! It’s rare to come across an anime that’s this pandering to my taste, but I am so glad I get to indulge once more in the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417805">
        succulent goodness of this cloyingly adorable show of found family.<br />
<br />
But before I even talk about the profuse comfort I feel from the show’s overall narrative, I absolutely MUST talk about the prepossessing, utterly stunning animation! Even without 2 of their best directors, KyoAni still has one of the absolute most talented staff in the industry. They only work on a small handful of projects a year, but they pour so much love and heart into each and every one of those projects, and it really, REALLY shows. What’s even more impressive is that they somehow keep improving from one project to the next, taking all of what they’ve learned from the previous project and building upon it. It’s so exciting just to see what they’re going to do next, and the moment that OP played in the first episode, I had quite a euphoric eureka experience. The way each shot zooms into each character in this high-acceleration way, only to transition to the next character, looks EXACTLY like Nichijou. Not only that, but it looks so much better than it too! Nichijou had characters mostly still, or doing simple motion, but Maid Dragon took it a step further and made each shot have amazingly complex character animation alongside the zooms to create such a remarkable display of talent. Then I looked up that Ishihara, director of Nichijou, is directing this project, and it made me SO excited for no reason. Fast forward 10 minutes, and then we get one of, if not, THE most impressive energy blasts I’ve ever seen in the past 10 years I’ve been watching anime. Witnessing that for the first time had me floored and outright flabbergasted by just how incredible the animation is (I need to find out the animator responsible after this review). Even just the way each character moves looks spectacular. I remember, towards the end of episode 2, the way Tohru jumps between Kobayashi and Ilulu, the way her dress spins around in a circle, the way she randomly throws a peace sign in front of her eyes, the way wildly flails her arms, and that amusing expression she has on her face, it all adds up to such a delightful experience. This is a sakuga nut’s wet dream. I seriously can’t stop gushing about the animation because it’s just that good! I couldn’t tell you how many times I hit that left arrow just to rewatch a clip. In this audiovisual medium, the animation is the most important aspect of a show. You can have a story by reading a book or watching a Hollywood movie, but you’re not going to get stellar animation. For me, animation has LIMITLESS potential, because you’re not bound by reality like you are in live-action. So, it’s baffling to me that so many studios don’t take full advantage of the medium. So many anime has the same cookie-cutter look, and here we have KyoAni just flexing on everyone. And that’s just the surface!<br />
<br />
Beyond that shiny surface is an unexpectedly down-to-earth portrayal of found family. Each and every relationship is awkwardly intimate in its own amusing way, but they instill a profound feeling of warmth and comfort for one another. It’s that sense of acceptance and welcoming that makes the show feel so unabashedly genuine. It feels as though, no matter who you are or where you’re from, whether you’re a nutcase on the street who wants to destroy the city or an adorable loli who needs some affection, there will always be someone who can accept you for who you are and welcome you with open arms. Even if you don’t have a home yet, it doesn’t mean that there isn’t a home waiting for you, and that sentiment is just so sweet. Dragons represent those “weirdos” who believe they don’t fit in with society, that they must ostracize themselves from the rest of the world because they’re just too “different” or some bullshit like that. They claim to be independent when really, they just need the comfort of a friend just as anyone else would. I really appreciate how shamelessly forthright the show is with its fetishes. Every dragon has balloon tiddies, aside from Kanna and Fafnir (for obvious reasons). While I’m not into that myself, considering the show’s themes of acceptance, I quite admire the confidence to include this in the show. This season, we’re introduced to a new red-haired dragon, and she’s both a loli AND big-titted. It looks goofy as hell, and I love it. KyoAni has a reputation for subdued fanservice, so I’m glad they didn’t hold back in a lot of these ecchi scenes, because it isn’t totally vapid. It’s a strangely taboo subject matter, but sexuality plays a major part in one’s life, and many people have been shunned for their odd preferences. Allowing Maid Dragon to explore this near-universal aspect of one’s life only adds to its already thematically rich narrative. Also, it’s just great comedy. Having most of the cast be world-ending fish-out-of-water dragons adds a unique slant to an otherwise tired genre. I mean, epic action scenes have no business being in a slice-of-life, and yet it’s some of the best I’ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
So yea, if I haven’t made it clear yet, I love Maid Dragon. Just watching these characters interact and finding solace within one another fills me up with so much joy. And the way the show just sprinkles in brief nuggets of wisdom makes it all the more reassuring. And above all, it gives me hope, hope that I will one day be able to find my own home and create my own family, and also hope that great anime like this will continue to be made. <br />
<br />
Thank you for reading.<br />

    I had no idea such a sequel was coming as I thought the show had ended and Kyoto Animation took a hard hit from the tragedy but currently 4 episodes in as of writing this review, and I love every second of it.<br />
<br />
I would have normally given this show a 10 which I plan on giving it if it continues like this but I realize that may partly be because of how much respect I have for Kyoto Animation as a Studio, the work they make, and the tough times they went through which would turn my 10 to a 9 but that&#039;s about it.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410463">
        The reason I am writing this review is that I was expecting more people to have similar thoughts which there sure are but not as much as I was expecting for an anime of this caliber. The animation is amazing, the color coordination and choices are amazing, the small details like having the train&#039;s holding things on the ceiling be actually animated is amazing, the effort they put into this is amazing, and currently, the story is going pretty well in my opinion. Some people also acknowledge the animation and art but are worried about the story or pacing or are just watching the anime for the &quot;plot&quot; which is exactly what I don&#039;t understand.<br />
<br />
The anime doesn&#039;t have many many episodes and will probably peak around 13 episodes or something similar to that so there won&#039;t be a HunterxHunter or Naruto kind of pacing and at the end of the day, the show is a comedy oriented slice of life that also can encompass more serious themes next to the holy Kanna moments that make people go to jail, but even if you are wary of the story, most of the show still hasn&#039;t aired so I think if the show keeps going strong, those thoughts will also inevitably change. However, what I don&#039;t get is people watching this for the &quot;plot&quot;. There is &quot;plot&quot; in many of the scenes and characters but why would you watch the show for that? I see it more like a bonus rather than a part of the show that makes it good. I don&#039;t see why you would watch this show for the &quot;plot&quot; when you can watch trashy OVA&#039;s or shows that focus on just that. Maybe I&#039;m the weird one here but still, I think the show has a lot more to offer than that.<br />
<br />
 It&#039;s still pretty early to give a solid review but there has been a lack of reviews for this show (as of writing this) so I thought I&#039;d jump in the ring as well. In conclusion, the show looks good, sounds good, great to have Kyoto Animation back, like that they gave credit in the opening to Takemoto Yasuhiro (rip), and the story is going pretty smooth. Go watch it if you haven&#039;t cus this show is some fine wine. I rest my case.

-Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is literally an anime everyone watches just FoR tHe PlOt and i understand completely.<br />
<br />
this second season isn&#039;t entirely bad or maybe this ilulu arc is just bad but still<br />
let&#039;s take a look at it and appreciate Kyoto animation for going through drawing this pain again i mean the visuals are amazing and really hits and Makes every single character Outstand the other, Seriously the art and Animation Slaps and keeps looking amazing every single episode<br />
<br />
But did something get nerfed while i

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410450">
        don&#039;t know ?<br />
<br />
this Boob sizes are just being used as an execuse to spam boob jokes all the time<br />
<br />
But still for a Slice of Life anime i would say it&#039;s a little pushed if u know what i mean Especially episode 4 and 2 but too bad kobayashi doesn&#039;t have a penis anymore (the most ridiculous Joke)<br />
<br />
This anime can be funny and can show some amazing action scenes once in<br />
an while and be so fun to watch especially some scenes that needs to be rewatched lol but it still Lacks pretty much every other single thing and i would say something about that it lacks a better protagoninst no lying kobayashi is just awkward<br />
<br />
but Still Still wE aRe WaTcHiNg fOr PlOt AfTeR aLl<br />

&quot;Miss Kobayashi&#039;s Dragon Maid&quot; has always been about experiencing new things, and it&#039;s only fitting that S2 follows suit. In its absence the show we know and love has become bolder, tackling familiar SoL topics with a measure of character growth that&#039;s sure to resonate with viewers. S2 isn&#039;t afraid to stray from its sketch show formula, introducing flashbacks which showcase how much our dragons have grown. Of course, the series&#039; trademark comedy makes a welcome return, embracing innocence and community with a leisurely atmosphere. Hilarious and wholesome in equal measure, &quot;Dragon Maid&quot; is back, and better than ever. 8/10~<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Was I praying for a second

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417801">
        season of &quot;Miss Kobayashi&#039;s Dragon Maid&quot;? Nah.<br />
<br />
<br />
Look. Before you break out the pitchforks, please believe that this is coming from a fan who adored S1. For all the wholesome happiness &quot;Dragon Maid&quot; (DM for short) doled out back in 2017, I wasn&#039;t exactly clamoring for a sequel. Unlike countless one-season wonders that are crying for an anime follow-up to this day, DM didn&#039;t strike my skeptic self as the type of show that would either benefit from a continuation or significantly build upon the status quo.<br />
<br />
Oh, how wrong I was.<br />
<br />
Having completed this series&#039; spectacular sophomore outing, I&#039;m pleased to report that it&#039;s a worthy instalment for the franchise. S2 came not only with the realization of just how much I&#039;ve missed DM, but also with surprising improvements. This sequel is one for both the skeptics and those dearly in need for some fun this anime season. Let&#039;s come together and discover what &quot;maid&quot; this season so dang special.<br />
<br />
The dragon gang&#039;s all here, as if they&#039;d never left. The series premiere sets us right on-track with one of the funniest meta sketches yet, as everyone&#039;s favorite maid^ Lady Tohru finds herself taking her services to a Japanese maid café! The familiar fun doesn&#039;t stop there, with the rest of the cast in full swing. Kanna continues to redefine cuteness with her many playful childhood adventures, often accompanied by a lovestruck Saikawa. Meanwhile in the working world, Elma the sweet-tooth learns more and more about the worklife crunch of a middle class office worker. Takiya helps with her taxing load as a reliable colleague by day, before grinding out MMORPGs as a full-blown otaku by night, alongside the sullen NEET Fafnir. And lest we forget, our flirtatious Lucoa is still doing all sorts of unspeakable things to her beloved Shouta-kun, an eager mage-in-training. Finally, at the beating heart of this lovable community is Miss Kobayashi, a kindhearted dragon ambassador with an achy back and a knack for reaching out to her friends in need. Her affinity for booze is only matched by that of sharing thoughtful advice as a mentor for our scaly pals.<br />
<br />
Things seemed the same as they have ever been. S2 simply maintaining the series&#039; trademarks of great comedy and wholesome joy would already have been cause for celebration. If S2&#039;s episodes were just Tohru trying to feed Kobayashi her tail for 20 minutes, you can bet that I&#039;d still be happy to laugh along each week. The lively, likable goofballs of DM had won me over long ago, so just watching their daily lives play out would have been enough to satisfy my SoL cravings. But to my surprise, S2 seemed intent on taking its entertaining formula to new heights. Take, for example, the introduction of a brand new cast member: the fiery Chaos Dragon Ilulu. Her backstory is sobering stuff, and her arrival draws some parallels to how Tohru&#039;s second life on earth got off the ground. The developments didn&#039;t stop there, as DM continued to spread its wings in new directions. I found myself taken aback by how much of S2 built upon the simple gags and sketches I&#039;d grown accustomed to. S2 offers a great deal of thoughtful character maturity hand-in-hand with hilarious childlike shenanigans. In order to explain where DM&#039;s growth comes from, we need to go back to the roots of this series&#039; simple success.<br />
<br />
DM celebrates the fun of discovery and unity. S1 achieves this goal through the charming interactions between dragons and humans. For eons, these ditzy dragons have observed our human world from a distance. Now that they&#039;re finally able to experience our lives firsthand, the dragons embrace our mundane day-to-day activities with excitement and curiosity. Most of S1 is dedicated to these dysfunctional dragons settling into their new lives. The comedy and cuteness that ensues from our dragons&#039; hijinks stems from them setting aside their differences. Getting together in harmony can be a wonderful exchange, allowing all from different walks of life to learn new things and foster new bonds. DM&#039;s many moe elements and comfy vibes further demonstrate how fun and rewarding this cultural experience can be. This solid, sweet foundation can still be seen and enjoyed throughout S2. However, this sequel doesn&#039;t shy away from broadening its horizons in unexpected ways.<br />
<br />
S2 shifts focus from the dragons&#039; pleasant present experiences to their lives in the past. Shocking truths and revelatory origins of our friends come to light, through various flashbacks that deviate from DM&#039;s typical tone and fluff. From these glimpses into the distant past, we&#039;re introduced to unfamiliar versions of our fire-breathing friends. Viewers will get a glimpse of what it&#039;s like to be a dragon, and where their selfish way of life differs from ours. At the same time, these origin stories tell us that maybe Tohru and the gang haven&#039;t changed that much at all. Perhaps they&#039;ve always sought to see the world in a new light - to be kind, to be happy, to be loved. Perhaps the human world was a gateway to finally meeting those desires.<br />
<br />
Here on Earth, a second shot at life presents our dragons with opportunities not possible in their previous realm. Before, these mythical creatures were content with isolation and chose to avoid the trivial activities of lesser beings. Now, having kept their horns hidden, our friends can fully explore what it means to be a part of a community, with shared struggles and relationships. Finally, these age-old beings can embrace simple innocence, and find all kinds of fun with friends and loved ones. For the first time, our dragons get to learn the meaning of selflessness, and how to act for the wellbeing of others. And let&#039;s not forget Kobayashi&#039;s end of things as well, as she muses over her own new life as a role model (and love interest) for our dragons. S2 portrays these brief arcs brilliantly, in ways that are both hilarious and heartwarming. Viewers get to live vicariously through the wholesome antics of the dragons, in large part thanks to Kyoto Animation&#039;s immaculate attention to detail. Seriously, they&#039;ve outdone themselves once more with this one. There&#039;s no reason why a Slice-of-Life show should wind up being a legitimate contender for prettiest anime of the year, let alone contain stunning action cuts that put proper shounen seasonals to shame in the visual department^^. This season is sensational; probably the only downside I can propose is that of sequels in general. DM is still going to have moments that fall into &quot;moe -blob&quot; territory, and risqué jokes featuring Saikawa and Lucoa are still bound to raise a few eyebrows. This sequel is a sizable step-up over what came before, but shouldn&#039;t be expected to change the minds of those who dislike the first season. But as for the rest of us existing DM enjoyers, we can rest easy in knowing that S2 has deepened its already-enriching experience, on both a thematic and emotional level. Truly, a must-see sequel.<br />

STRAY RAMBLINGS (SPOILERS):<br />
- ^Sorry, Georgie. You did scare the shit out of me when you started showing up at several places at once.<br />
- ^^The fantastic animation quality is made way more impressive given that many key staff members were youngsters. Due to recent events, KyoAni being shortstaffed on talent was a serious possibility. Putting their trust in youngsters for some truly phenomenal cuts and visual choices just makes me love this awesome studio that much more. This production model bodes really well, and I&#039;m gonna keep my eyes peeled for the kind of sakuga talent that&#039;ll bloom from this youth development in the years to come.<br />
- THE. KANNA. EPISODE. IN. NYC. GAVE. ME. DIABETES.<br />
- I think Elma&#039;s workplace story in Ep 9 doesn&#039;t get enough credit. I&#039;m really surprised at how the sketch played out, given how unassuming Kobayashi&#039;s office culture must have been to a local audience. The things Elma were stressing over are practically non-issues over in Japan. Work culture is known to prioritise the company over the individual, to the point where workers feel bad about using mandatory annual leave. Plus, Elma&#039;s &quot;lobbying&quot; for workplace reform marks the rare occasion where the dragons challenge the human way of doing things. It was a pretty profound statement really, all while being a lighthearted watch at the expense of Elma&#039;s tremendous efforts.<br />
- S1&#039;s OP &amp; ED are the better of the franchise&#039;s pair IMO, but I&#039;m not complaining about what we got here. fhána&#039;s hook is unstoppable. SING ALONG, PAPARAPAPA...<br />
- BEST GIRL: Strictly in a waifu sense, Lucoa can get it. But how can I not shoutout Kanna for being so damn adorable from start to finish? AHHHHH~<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Thanks for joining me on this quick read! Now if you&#039;ll excuse me, watching Elma eat candies has got me craving for dessert. As if this show wasn&#039;t sweet enough as is! If you happen to like my verbose rants, feel free to check out my other reviews for seasons past and present, peace~

    Wow… With the introduction of Ilulu, season 2 has easily eclipsed season 1 by far. Ilulu is hot!  There were so many peak moments, that it would be impossible to list them all.<br />
<br />
 Firstly, KyoAni did an exquisite job animating the Ilulu fight scene. A particular highlight of the sequence for me was when Ilulu’s bust glowed red-hot, with subsequent flames erupting from her oral cavity. Seeing as how she derives her infernal abilities from her chest it makes sense why they are so massive. I’d honestly argue that they should be bigger! Looking at the source material, it seems that KyoAni unfortunately did the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410370">
        fans a disservice by nerfing them in the anime. <br />
<br />
Another particularly noteworthy scene was when Lucoa was on the phone, while Shouta was practicing on his recorder. Earlier in episode 1 Shouta was stated to know Lucoa’s location no matter where she was, because of their “special connection”.  This special connection was put to show in this scene, as Lucoa effortlessly synchronize the bobbing of her cheeks with Shouta’s playing, WITHOUT even looking in his direction. With the bond that they forged all throughout season one, due to their countless moments together it makes sense why their connection is so strong. <br />
<br />
All of the previously mentioned moments were great, but my favorite scene BY FAR has to be when Ilulu attempted to seduce Kobayashi. The sounds of the threads ripping as Ilulu ripped her clothes in two is ingrained in my memory. This is something I have not experienced firsthand yet, so I am glad to live vicariously through Kobayashi.<br />
<br />
It’s truly a shame that Kobayashi only wielded the holy sword Excalibur for such a short duration. I would have loved to see male Kobayashi with any and/or all of the female cast. If I was Kobayashi, I’d take Ilulu up on her offer and “fill the loneliness from her lack of family”. Kobayashi’s willpower is truly admirable.  <br />
<br />
All in all, this is a great SoL, with tasteful fan service, and enough action to satisfy even the battle shonen fans. I’d definitely check this out.<br />

    Yasuhiro Takemoto’s influence is clearly gone and very missed, but I don’t think anyone could complain about anything other than that. Call me a baby, but after the arson, I had a really hard time returning to Kyoto Animation, and rewatching Takemoto’s work in particular was honestly draining and left me an emotional wreck. From a practical perspective, you could make the argument this show has the greatest opening in anime history, because it does the best job of letting the viewer know exactly what they’re in for. Tatsuya Ishihara is a rightfully beloved director who carried this studio through its nascency, but with him

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417802">
        helming the project, it’s hard not to feel a palpable sense of emptiness where Takemoto’s brilliant storyboarding used to be. The opening is still a great time, and it brings back Ishihara’s fun little zoom-in trick from Nichijou, so I don’t want to rain on the parade any more than I already have, but you get the point. No matter how good it is, it’s not the same. This series demonstrates the loss we’re going to have to live with, as well as the talent and passion which will help us do so.<br />
<br />
Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid was originally authored by Coolkyoushinja, and while I say this with love, Coolkyoushinja is a serious degenerate. Their hyper-fetishized sex comedy is ridiculous, but in its own weird way, it has charm. It’s ironic many viewers found these elements hard to swallow in season one, because they were actually dumbed-down compared to what they were in the manga to make room for more emotionally grounded storytelling. This was Takemoto’s vision for the anime: putting less focus on the gag-comedy and elaborating on the themes which the manga merely scratched the surface of. Yamada Naoko did the same thing with K-On, a series which many are surprised to learn was adapted from a 4-koma manga, because she filled in so many gaps in its plot and characters at her own discretion, the result was genius. Doing this is a double edged sword, though, because it comes at the cost of giving people the wrong impression of the source material, so if the adaptation were to fall into different hands and become more faithful to the manga, the change could be jarring.<br />
<br />
This is what happened with Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid S. If season one felt like a typical Kyoto Animation show, this season feels like pure, unadulterated Coolkyoushinja. The fanservice is kicked up a notch, and the fetishes which were omitted from season one appear in full force. From futanari to oppai loli, all the hentai tags which were missing from Takemoto’s adaptation have found their way into Ishihara’s, and if it wasn’t for the fact Kyoto Animation doesn’t put nudity in their shows anymore, this would be a 1:1 adaptation of the manga. The comfy found-family moments from season one were what made the show feel so genuine and mature despite its appearances, and much like Yamada’s adaption of K-On, this season made me face the realization these touching moments either weren’t in the manga, or were based on much more standard drama. While none of this is to say this season has no emotional depth, it certainly never again achieved the same show-don’t-tell subtlety or contemplative atmosphere which season one could so naturally shift into and out of.<br />
<br />
I know this review has consisted almost entirely of comparisons which, in a certain light, may not seem positive, but I promise I’m being totally neutral. Whether you prefer a more faithful adaptation of Coolkyoushinja or one more in line with Takemoto’s vision is entirely up to you. I just want everyone to known this is a fundamentally different show from season one. And this isn’t just about Takemoto either. Mikiko Watanabe, Yoshiji Kigami, this was never going to be the same without these people, but those they left behind truly cared about doing it justice, and their love shows. For whatever you may think about its new creative direction, the series is still overwhelmingly delightful, the characters are still the most endearing people on the planet, and the animation is still extravagantly beautiful. It is, indeed, still a fantastic show that melts your heart and makes you smile, and it’s clear Kyoto Animation is trying to make a statement. They want the world to see they still have the talent and passion which has always made them who they are, and even after sustaining such devastating losses, they’ll continue being a source of joy for so many and producing by far the most polished, technically impressive anime the industry has to offer.<br />

Kobayashi&#039;s Dragon Maid returns Kyoto Animation back to scene of seasonals ever since Tsurune aired in October 2018, and what they have presented exceed my expectations from the first season, which was an incredible showing already. This show gets backlash from the fact that the new addition Ilulu has quite large body proportions, but instead this show presents how it can turn an idea of that proportion into something instead meant to help out the comedy of the show in a effortless way. <br />
<br />
If there is one thing that Kyoto Animation is known for, it&#039;s their ability to make everything look

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417818">
        visually stunning. Comparing to the animation quality of the original season of Kobayashi, everything looks much more cleaner and vibrant to help make the characters fit in perfectly to the backgrounds. It gets helped when the action scenes can have such good levels of quality to them that they feel like a top action studio is creating the works as it effortlessly makes the action stunning. <br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t too much of a story in this anime, for it being an Slice of Life Comedy about dragon&#039;s living in Japan, but what it lays in is a story that interlocks the characters backstories and thoughts from the past in the dragon world to Japan and how they would react logically to the changes. It wouldn&#039;t work as much without the level of comedy that occurs between the characters, even though most of them are continuing running jokes from season one, which still have the same effect as how they did in past. <br />
<br />
If there is one thing that carries the show compared to everything, it would be the vast characters in the show interacting with each other with ease and realism to it while making most moments having some comedy factor to them. The characters from season 1 have continued to be there while having small character developments throughout the season, especially seen through the likes of Elma and Tohru. Ilulu was the perfect way to spice up the story of Kobayashi, and seeing the character development from Ilulu throughout the story surprised me in how effortless it occured.<br />
<br />
If there is one thing that Kobayashi strives on that not many people care to notice about, it is the amazing OST and sound effects that the show has. The opening and ending theme are amazing, especially the opening being sung by Fhana again elevating the already great OP from the visuals to the next level with the mix of rap and pop style singing. The voicework fits the characters both in Japanese and English and the sound effects that occur from them, though absurd, helping make the show feel more alive and exaggerated, which helps with the mood of the crazy nature of the show. <br />
<br />
This show is funny, and I have a liking to nearly every single character in the show. It brings the Kyoto Animation charm which I have loved throughout my time watching anime to the next level flawlessly, which all it does is make me slime throughout watching it, and even cry when I saw the opening for the first time. This is a solid 10 in my markings.

    July 2019, I was taking a usual afternoon ride on the Tokyo Metro when an urgent news alert came across the in-train TV’s. The famed Kyoani studio had been the subject of an arson. Immediately my mind thought of all the people who would have been hard at work on what should have been a typical weekday afternoon. Sadly, to all of our dismay, 34 people, including the director of Maid Dragon, tragically lost their lives that day. <br />
<br />
Kyoani have been my favourite anime studio for years now. They have created so many magical experiences that have taught me and so many others life lessons.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417810">
        For such a studio to be attacked, over such a senseless reason, really broke my heart. I got a chance to pay my respects at the site of the fire a few days later along with several other fans. It was truly surreal to see the number of people who showed up in support of a studio that had done so much for so many.<br />
<br />
It was always a question of when, not “if” Kyoani would comeback. In the immediate aftermath of the fire, the president of KyoAni was adamant in his intent to rebuild the studio and continue working on projects. The Violet Evergarden movie was pretty close to completion before the fire, so Dragon Maid is really the first full project Kyoani have made since the fire. Although Takemoto Yasuhiro tragically passed away in the fire, Ishihara Tatsuya has stepped in and continued to build on the amazing work Takemoto did. If Maid Dragon season 1 was a funny, wholesome slice of life story, Maid Dragon S is a journey of self-discovery, acceptance, forgiveness and optimism. While I had a lot of fun in Dragon Maid season 1, I can’t really say there was ever an episode that got me emotional or really made me think. I found the plot of Maid Dragon S to be a step up in every regard. We have the same beloved characters we met in the first season, plus additions like Illulu who aren’t just there for jokes, but for legitimately moving moments. Illulu in particular has one of the best character arcs I’ve seen in a while. The tone in general feels much more serious. While we still have those comedic moments, Quetzocoatl’s boobs, Tohru sexually harassing Kobayashi, etc., it feels almost secondary to the plot. Which is always welcome.<br />
<br />
Kyoani are known for their stunning visuals. Whether it’s Kyoukai no Kanata, Violet Evergarden or Hibike Euphonium, they’ve consistently blended top notch storytelling with beautiful art and animation. Maid Dragon might not be the first show to come to mind when you think of animation and visuals, but let me assure you no expense was spared by KyoAni for this season. The show really does feel like it had years of development behind it. There’s several fight sequences particuraly during Elma and Tohru’s backstory arc and Illulu’s development arc, that are better than any shonen fight scene we’ve got this year. Of course in this type of show, things like that are not the sole focus, but it’s always nice to see the staff go the extra mile.<br />
<br />
I thought the pacing was fabulous throughout the season. Every single member of the cast got a backstory/development arc that adequately set them up for future development and arcs. The only thing I didn’t like was how fast it felt like episodes went by!<br />
<br />
Maid Dragon S is the perfect comeback for Kyoani. After so much tragedy, they’ve managed to craft a project that encapsulates acceptance and moving on from the past at the perfect time. Welcome back, Kyoani.<br />
<br />
Maid Dragon S gets 10 out of 10.

    I love Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon and jumped in joy when I learned that Kyoto Animation had announced a second season.<br />
<br />
In season 2 of Miss Kobayashi&#039;s Dragon Maid, you can expect even more chaos than before. When a mysterious landslide hits the town, Kobayashi, Tohru, Kanna and company realize that a dragon must be behind it, but all the dragons they know deny it. Another chaos dragon has appeared and after a brief exchange of blows, newcomer Ilulu decides that you can never have enough dragon maids. <br />
<br />
This review contains partial spoilers.<br />
<br />
Where exactly am I supposed to start here? <br />
<br />
I have to admit that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417816">
        I started to have some doubts after the first episode. Ilulu&#039;s first real action in this second season was to turn Kobayashi into a male and then try to seduce her. <br />
After such a great first season about the daily lives of humans and dragons, I wasn&#039;t thrilled to see big-breasted dragons trying to turn female humans into men and then seduce them. <br />
<br />
But don&#039;t get me wrong. I love Ilulu. She&#039;s great. She had plenty of great moments even though I think her personality and past could have been explored a little deeper.<br />
Other than that, Season 2 explored more of the world they live in and also dived deeper into character relationships.<br />
Kanna&#039;s and Tohru&#039;s moments were as great as they were in season 1 and I enjoyed every second of their scenes. Even Elma had some great moments throughout the series. Her past and interactions with Tohru were again a nice addition (Elma with long hair is the pinnacle of beauty).<br />
<br />
This is a comedy, slice of life and fantasy story. The sole purpose of this anime is wholesome comedy, but it just works. The jokes are funny and many still exist from season 1 and yet are not overused. I have absolutely no complaints about the opening and ending, as they just fit the series perfectly again and capture the essence of the series in a great way. As for the animation, KyoAni has once again outdone themselves. Everything looks just beautiful and the fight scenes are extremely detailed as well.<br />
The characters are very well written, the conversations are cute, yet very straightforward and down to earth. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t even know what more I could say. If you already liked the first season and if you can overlook the oversexualizing of girls, the second one will knock your socks off. I enjoyed every single moment of the second season and can only recommend it to you, because Kanna alone is worth watching this whole series... She is just way too cute. <br />

    SPOILER ALERT:<br />
<br />
Kyoto Animation came back in style, and so did this second season. Miss Kobayashi&#039;s Dragon Maid has always been a debatable series for me, and it took me a few episodes of this season to make me watch this after I completed the first season when the second season was still airing. I&#039;ll admit that most of the character designs seem too sexualized, but they make it up to us by providing a detailed story and occasionally adds some action to the mix. This second season is a massive step up in its quality, and I&#039;m glad that I got to watch it.<br />
<br />
The plot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417853">
        of the series is lighthearted, as it features many indications of Yuri between several characters while showing the slice-of-life aspects that make this series charming. Not only does it continue to show what the characters are like in personality, but it takes on a more serious note from time to time. Not only does it continue to explain the backstory between the dragons&#039; relationship with humans, allowing us to go into more depth about the characters we all come to know and love. The episodes are usually split into separate sections, and I liked how it gives us episodes that focus on a specific character group. Certain episodes can be really cute, such as the ones that focus on a fan-favorite character. While the other episodes still focus on the yuri relationship developing between the two main characters. On a separate note, my favorite episode was one where New York was featured in a Kanna-related episode, and I found it funny that it had characters speaking English for a slight moment.<br />
<br />
The story seems to have gained more tension in a few of the episodes, while occasionally has more action featured, which I&#039;m impressed with the way they handled that for being a comedy and slice-of-life series. Not only does it show Kobayashi still dealing with Tohru&#039;s expressive love, but it focuses on the character development between them. For example, there was an intense battle between Tohru and Elma in episode nine, and it not only gave them the chance to let their feelings out, but it allowed them to become better friends with each other, despite their friendly rivalry. The character development is one of the best aspects this season had animated, and I&#039;m happy KyoAni still has its game even after enduring many hardships.<br />
<br />
The characters were still a hit and miss for me occasionally. While I enjoyed watching their development and seeing them interact with each other, the character designs for a few of them still bothered me. Mainly the ridiculous bust sizes for characters such as Lucoa and newcomer Ilulu. While both of their character designs were to showcase their abilities and personality, those designs are saved by the story&#039;s plot. However, to make up for Ilulu&#039;s controversial appearance, her backstory gave Ilulu development on her views on humans while allowing her to gain feelings for another character, once again showing the equality in the relationship between species. The other returning characters have their recurring gags, which I&#039;m used to, while the other minor characters that debuted in this season are handled decently. Those minor characters didn&#039;t stand out that much, but they gave the other main cast a chance for better character development while being accompanied by a mix between action and comedic scenes. As for the main couple, Kobayashi and Tohru, their relationship is finally starting to get somewhere. Not only did Tohru&#039;s backstory allow Kobayashi to learn more about her past, but it also foreshadowed Kobayashi starting to return Tohru&#039;s feelings for her, and I&#039;m glad as this series has one of the best portrayals of yuri in any anime. If KyoAni ever decides on another season, I hope the both of them will finally be able to get together officially.<br />
<br />
The animation this season was as incredible as ever last season. What made this season amazing was the beautiful visuals KyoAni produced, as well as fluid and smooth character battles when they occurred on specific episodes. The way they use spells was breathtaking and showed how strong the dragons&#039; magical abilities are when they stop holding back against each other. As for the other episodes, they were well-animated, but nothing special occurred, if they get exciting, then the animation will go all out with their budget to satisfy the watchers. The visuals and fluidity for specific episodes were so incredible that they shocked me. The animation studio has the potential to create an all-action anime if given a proper budget. Thank you, Kyoto Animation, for being able to continue providing us beautiful animation. Although it has been rough due to the Arson attack, I&#039;m happy you&#039;re back. We all missed you so much.<br />
<br />
The sound design stepped up its game this season as well. With the inclusion of more action scenes, it made those fight scenes come to life with every impactful blow from an attack or magical attack combining with the visually breathtaking scenes. The soundtrack still stays as calm and charming as ever, but the opening and ending still have their wholesome vibes hiding what to expect in this season. The original singer for the first episode returns, and not only does it sound cute, but it can be bittersweet as KyoAni finally returns after years of recovering. Bonus points to the studio for making the opening a homage to the first director of season one. While we can&#039;t bring back the thirty-three KyoAni staff that lost their lives in the arson attack, we can honor them with the animation studio&#039;s grand return. The ending song was as cute as ever since they included the voice actors for the dragon girls again. The beginning of the ending song gave off vibes from another anime named Blend S, but it still has its original tune to its ending, which I respect.<br />
<br />
Overall, after deciding to watch this anime series after a long wait, I&#039;m glad that I made the right decision to check it out. I loved the animation this part produced, as well as the character development that occurred more often than in the first season. The visuals and animation were a masterpiece, and it was the right call to make Miss Kobayashi&#039;s Dragon Maid S the anime for KyoAni to return to first. Although  Lucoa and Ilulu&#039;s character designs still bother me, I&#039;m still supportive of this series earning the third season in the future. Once again, thank you, Kyoto Animation, for this incredible anime for the summer 2021 season.

I&#039;m not exaggerating one bit when i say this is one of the most beautiful shows i have ever laid my eyes on. When i watched the first season of Dragon Maid maybe about 7 or 8 months ago, i will be honest when i say it wasn&#039;t anything too special for me. It was still enjoyable, don&#039;t get me wrong, but back then, i didn&#039;t have the same love i have for this show like i do now.<br />
<br />
But OH BOY, it just got so much better.<br />
<br />
After the tragedy that was the Kyoto

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417869">
        Animation arson attack, i was wondering where the animation studio would go from there. It was truly a heart-wrenching thing for me to have heard go down, and i hope the loser who did that is rotting in his prison cell somewhere. Anyways, let&#039;s not get off topic here. I was hoping KyoAni would make their return, and come back 110% more stronger than they originally were, and they did not disappoint one bit. Everything about Dragon Maid now, for me, is simply special. It&#039;s part of my life now. This show, for it&#039;s 12 episode runtime, has brought quite literally nothing but JOY for me. I would even go as far to say that the second season of Dragon Maid is the epitome of perfection. At the end of the day, the story isn&#039;t really all that unique, but who freaking cares anymore? It&#039;s waifu dragons, for christ&#039;s sake! <br />
<br />
The art is absolutely gorgeous and immaculate, and even non anime watchers can&#039;t argue with this. You can even go as far to hate EVERYTHING about anime, but you&#039;re not allowed to diss Dragon Maid. it&#039;s just a cardinal sin at that point. The colors are bright, vibrant, alive, and so in your face, but that&#039;s alright, because the show is already so beautiful that i&#039;m genuinely craving for more. The sound design is impeccable, it&#039;s not too in your face, it&#039;s mixed very well and blends magnificently with everything else that the show provides. The VA&#039;s do an impeccable job bringing life to these amazing characters, and there&#039;s not one singular moment where i got tired of any character whatsoever. They all each provide as much enjoyment as possible, so even if they&#039;re technically side characters, they still feel like main characters.<br />
<br />
Like i&#039;ve probably said countless times already, i REALLY, REALLY, REALLY enjoyed this, from start to finish. There is simply not one thing wrong with this show. Everything, in my humble opinion, happened for a reason and was executed well to fit in the story, even if it was a little questionable. You won&#039;t get any better than this. Or, maybe you could. I don&#039;t know. But still, this is the definition of solid. I&#039;m absolutely impressed with everything about this show, and if i sound greedy when i say i want more, then i guess i&#039;m simply just greedy. I can&#039;t get enough.<br />
<br />
Thank you.

    Story:<br />
This season was way more story driven than season 1 as we got introduced to a lot more characters backstories and lore, which was generic compared to anime where the story is the main focus, but I think it was written beautifully for what the anime is and it was engaging. It wasn&#039;t anything special, but for a slice life, it was good. I loved the slice of life aspects though and I think the scenarios written for this anime were fun and entertaining, I think they introduced the new characters great and the scenarios flowed perfectly into each other, compared to a lot of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417827">
        other slice of life anime, where the scenes feel choppy together.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
They almost just used the same music for this season as they did for season one, but I don&#039;t have a problem with that, as I feel they perfected the soundtrack with season 1, so I will mostly be talking about the opening, which I think is a banger, I love the opening and find it a lot more exciting to begin every episode with than season 1s opening.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
This season not only introduced new characters, but also greatly expanded on the relationships between each character, examples being Tohru and Elma, Takiya and Shouta, and Fafnir and Shouta, it was nice seeing characters we didn&#039;t see interact much, interact with each other more this season and I found it more charming. I liked seeing Kanna interacted with children besides Saikawa for once and see not just how the characters are now, but how they were before and watch them touch on how their past relationships influenced their current relationships. I also really liked seeing how Tohru&#039;s father sees Tohru as a daughter and how we got to see both his and her perspective on her actions.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I enjoyed season 2 a lot more than season 1, I enjoyed the slice of life segments, I enjoyed the characters relationships with each other, I enjoyed the sheer amount of backstory we got, and although I read the manga and wasn&#039;t too excited by seeing that again, I enjoyed seeing them while I read the manga quite a lot so I imagine if I was an anime only, I would have enjoyed getting the backstories the way they did in the anime, much more than the way the manga did it. <br />
<br />
Overall thoughts:<br />
I give this a ten out of ten, call me biased, but I enjoyed this anime greatly, much more than most anime I&#039;ve seen and I will definitely be re watching this anime quite a lot. So for now, I&#039;ll just say that if you really love slice of life anime, if you loved season 1, you will enjoy season 2 much more. If you love the characters already, you will enjoy this quite a lot.

    I think this show is peak slice of life. The first season shows wacky nonsense that&#039;s really fun to watch, since it premise is living with a dragon that knows nothing about humans and is very over the top, and that made a very good slice of life. However this season kinda deviates from that, they could&#039;ve made more wacky nonsense, instead, they made the characters grow to live normal lives and give them backstories. This was a very good move, since the ending of the first season puts real emotions to unrealistic situations. And this season did more of that, and they absolutely crushed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417819">
        it.<br />
<br />
Gotta put this out there, the op and ed are absolute bangers. The art was mesmerising, and the colors and scenery really fit the feel of the show. The music as stunning, almost every episode has a &quot;montage&quot;, where there are no dialogues just music, and it portrays events, sceneries and emotions perfectly. And the action, holy crap the action was beautiful, it was so well animated and was just pleasing to look at. <br />
<br />
So, dargon maid s is a perfect sequel imo, it really portrays the characters growth from the first season. If you came into this wanting more stuff like season 1, then I  get that this show may fall short in at area. However, this season gives us satisfaction, via backstories or character growth, while retaining that wackiness. In this season, Tohru actually tries to understand humans , and considers Kobayashi&#039;s feelings wherever she does something. It&#039;s really satisfying to see Tohru do this, all that Kobayashi did in season 1 is paying off. Kanna grows as a child, Lucoa treats Shouta well, Fafnir gets more sreen time, Elma gets an epic backstory and a new character is introduced.<br />
<br />
So in short, this season is a masterpiece, each episode has it&#039;s own story and the growth and backtrories we recieved were anazing. Watch this season.<br />
<br />
Sorry I didn&#039;t mention Ilulu.

    Ladies and gentlemen...Kyoani is BACK! After rebuilding from the worst domestic terror attack in post WW2 Japanese history, they have returned to make it moe time once again!<br />
<br />
Dragon Maid S2 starts out right where season 1 left off. While this season does go  more into the politics of Tohru&#039;s home world, this is still not a plot focused anime. This is about wholesome cuteness, silly humor, and also oppai. LOTS of oppai.<br />
<br />
This season only introduced 1 new dragon girl and sadly she&#039;s in my opinion the weakest member of the cast. It&#039;s not that she&#039;s a bad character. Her backstory is actually pretty decent

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417850">
        and she builds upon the chaos vs. order conflict from the first season. However, she adds by far the least to the series&#039; humor and this is primarily a comedy anime. Her character design is also pretty lame. She has these massive tits, but isn&#039;t proportioned in a satisfying way like THICC Lucoa. Instead she looks like an Eiken character escaped that trash fire, became a scalie, and invaded Dragon Maid.<br />
<br />
While the addition of Ilulu wasn&#039;t flawless, we did get the satisfying addition of Shouta&#039;s father as an evil wizard who runs the shitty, exploitative corporation that Kobayashi works for. This guy was hilarious and every one of his scenes was amusing. I really want to see more of him in season 3.<br />
<br />
The humor was overall a little weaker than season 1, thus my rating of a 7 instead of 8. However, this season still had some amazing jokes and is very worth watching.  Hell, this show may have been the first anime ever to actually make me laugh at a pun! I won&#039;t spoil it for those who haven&#039;t watched yet, but Lucoa badly misunderstands Father&#039;s Day and its really funny. There was never an episode where I got bored or felt like I wasted my time. When all 12 episodes are thoroughly enjoyable, you know it&#039;s still a quality show!<br />
<br />
Outside of the comedy, this season had some pretty strong character development. I still think that Tohru and Kobayashi are one of the best lesbian couples in anime. Sure, they&#039;ll never be as iconic as Haruka and Michiru from Sailor Moon S, but this is an ecchi series written by a mangaka who is openly a complete degenerate. You wouldn&#039;t expect quality romance at all or for this series to be so sweet, but somehow it is. I think a lot of that has to be credited to Kyoani and the late Yasuhiro Takemoto, who directed season 1 and part of season 2 before tragically losing his life in the 2019 arson attack.<br />
<br />
The animation is spectacular. This series took a little while to come out, but it was worth it! The fight scenes look better than at least 95% of series to come out this year. Not bad for an ecchi/moe series! The soundtrack is also very strong and the OP is an absolute BANGER. I never skipped the OP a single time. It should be a federal crime to skip this OP!<br />
<br />
Overall, I have to highly recommend S2 of Dragon Maid. Kyoani has overcome tragedy and adversity to somehow maintain the same level of high quality that made them so beloved in the first place. Definitely watch this series unless you&#039;re allergic to comedy or thicc dragon girls!<br />

    It&#039;s been over 2 years since the tragedy that hit Kyoto Animation during the Summer of 2019. Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon S marks the grand return of its franchise on the television screen. For a beloved show that graced upon us with maids, dragons, otaku culture, and Kanna&#039;s endless charm, we are once again treated with this near masterpiece.<br />
<br />
Right off the bat, we are reintroduced our lovely dragon maid Tohru and her everlasting admiration for Kobayashi. Even though it&#039;s been nearly 4 years since the anime aired on television, you could see the immediate character chemistry return between the cast. Without a shadow of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417831">
        a doubt, Tohru and Kobayashi share a special relationship and this continues throughout the season. However, a new season also means new faces so we are introduced to Ilulu, a Chaos faction dragon that causes problems in the human world. With the drama she hammers into the show, we do witness the behavior of a misunderstood dragon. It&#039;s clear that she lacks common sense as others but that&#039;s the entertaining element about her. Ilulu represents the chaotic side of the dragon speices, a being that needed to be tamed. And thanks to Tohru, Kobayashi, and other, she begins to accept her life on the Earth.<br />
<br />
Ilulu isn&#039;t the only problem landing this season. Soon enough, there are other beings appearing such as the dragon hunter Clemene. It&#039;s safe to say that at the beginning of this sequel, it wanted to really spice up the drama. As more episodes progressed, we do see the anime settle down with a slower pacing and lighter mood. At its best, I believe this franchise works as a slice of life story telling the everyday adventures of humans and dragons. This is accomplished through its principal cast such as Kobayashi/Tohru, Kanna/Riko, and Elma/Shouta. Watching this season shows what the director and Kyoto Animation do what they&#039;re best at - to bring a story formulated with such everyday adventures. From amusement parks to big cities such as New York, the anime has a ton of imagination and isn&#039;t afraid to pull out the cards.<br />
<br />
Even with the amount of comedy and entertainment this show has to offer, it also touches on some surprisingly realistic qualities of life. Most noticably is the aspect of job employment. Even  Ilulu takes up as job at a candy store to become more familiarized with humans. Tohru&#039;s role as a maid continues to bring out her inner love for the work and being there for Kobayashi. Even the idea of labor union is developed thanks to Elma&#039;s efforts. Ultimately, I believe this show loves its own premise and always seeks ways to be creative with it. Thankfully, it works out thanks to the character personalities and their roles in the show.<br />
<br />
Even after all these years, Kyoto Animation hasn&#039;t lost their touch when animating the fantastic visual elements of the franchise. It sets the bar for terrific chereography despite facing hardships such as arson attack and global pandemic. Looking at this season from the first episode shows that art director Shouko Ochiai has talent when crafting background visuals. Others such as Nobuaki Maruki and Miku Kadowaki made valuable contributions to sell the show as an visual extravaganza. Some of the highlights of this season includes Tohru vs Ilulu and Tohru vs Elma are just a testament of this anime is capable of. Even the OP theme song contains dancing sequences courtsey of Taichi Ishidate&#039;s talent. The already established Kyoto Animation shows that it still has the talent to build on what it achieved in previous years. Likewise, this season also contains eccentic energy with electrifying character expressions. It&#039;s a breathtaking experience when watching the show as a what it advertised and you&#039;re not going to regret it. <br />
<br />
This is the sequel fans have been waiting for and I guarantee there won&#039;t be regrets. With an already established character cast that further enchances its portfolio, there&#039;s all the reason to jump into this season. Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is an IP that tipify the evolution of Kyoto Animation and how a studio can rise back up when it gets knocked down.

    I&#039;m 5 episodes into the second season and wow.. is it kinda disappointing.<br />
It&#039;s perfectly fine but the introduction of Ilulu made me dislike it a bit more and I had to cringe through the 5 that I had watched. I might still watch the rest so the character bit may be subject to change.<br />
<br />
This is sort of ranty. Be warned if you hate stuff like that. No spoilers?<br />
<br />
Story - 7/10<br />
I find the story to be good! I&#039;m not saying it was the best in the first but it definitely is a bit worse here somehow even though it&#039;s practically the same. <br />
<br />
Art - 9/10<br />
Like season

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415087">
        1, the art is amazing. I could gush about how well-animated everything is or the character design but... I&#039;m not for the character design. Ilulu is the big stand-out here, her design is so bad it&#039;s laughable almost. The elephant in the room is um... the bazongas. It&#039;s just so ridiculous on her I can&#039;t find any defense for it. She is also childish in the design, especially with how her facial proportions are akin to one of a child&#039;s. I&#039;m not saying she IS a child but she is a minor in age (16). Her outfit before she wears the shirt is also absolutely ridiculous, I just don&#039;t get it. But otherwise, the art is amazing.<br />
<br />
Sound - 10/10<br />
I have no complaints, I did not watch the sub for the first season. But the sub has amazing sound and voice quality, including the theme. I have no complaints.<br />
<br />
Characters - 4/10<br />
Characters were a strong point in season one, especially with my favorite (Fafnir.) The characters were all a joy to watch and connect with. But S? Nah, the characters are kinda bad. Most of the ones I enjoyed stayed the same and I still love them so (Fafnir, Takiya, and Elma). But the others were kinda.. worse? The sexualization of Kanna and other child characters is prominent and Riko is still the absolute worst for me. Somehow Tohru got even more annoying, Kobayashi is fine. I don&#039;t mind her at all. Ilulu got annoying quickly, I found her to be interesting in episodes 1 &amp; 2 but the rest she was... meh.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 5/10<br />
It&#039;s not like I enjoyed all of Dragon Maid, hell no. But the slice of life elements and the soft scenes between the gays and lesbians made it enjoyable (fafiya &amp; kobaharu). This season, the slice of life was all there, every element of the enjoyment I had from the first season was there, and yet, I just didn&#039;t enjoy it as much. It&#039;s still perfectly fine I just don&#039;t enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Overall - 5/10<br />
I don&#039;t have much more to say. Don&#039;t attack me lol.

    [SPOILER-FREE]<br />
<br />
Whenever a good show gets a sequel, there is a huge possibility that it will fail to recreate the same magic as its predecessor. Especially when you consider most SOL (Slice of Life) shows, this phenomenon is true most of the time. But for some reason this season of Dragon Maid has surpassed it&#039;s previous season in every aspect. <br />
<br />
Story(8/10):<br />
One of the main reasons this series excelled as a SOL is that it has solid story progression throughout the series which I think most of the similar shows lack which makes things repetitive.<br />
Story starts with our lovely maid Tooru still trying to master all qualities

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417809">
        of a proper maid. With introduction of a new character story moves forward. Each new episode gives more insight of the world which further helps us understand our characters even more than before. We get to see more of Elma, Kanna and of course Tooru. <br />
The pacing of this show is amazing it manages to give proper share of real story progression while maintaining the same entertainment factor throughout an episode.<br />
<br />
Art(9/10):<br />
oh man, what the hell with this animation, this can put many battle shounen to shame XD <br />
Joking apart, this show really does some outstanding work in it&#039;s art and animation. Lets forget some exceptional battle scenes this season has to offers, just try to focus on the background animation in most of the outdoor scenes, it is really amazing. This amount of detailing really shows the calibre of Kyoto Animation. Bright colors fits perfectly with the theme of this show and enhances the viewing experience <br />
<br />
Sound(8/10):<br />
I personally enjoyed the opening and ending of this season more than the first one. OSTs blends well throughout the show though there were no standouts among them.<br />
Now talking about the voice acting, it was as amazing as the first season. We finally get to hear more of our adorable Kanna :)<br />
<br />
Character(8/10):<br />
This season was special as we get to know many of our character&#039;s past and how things were before the encounter of kobayashi and Tooru. Though I would like to see more of Kobayashi, her past and family. At the end all characters are likable, you can&#039;t get enough of them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(9/10):<br />
To me this was one of the most entertaining show I watched in a while<br />
Likable characters, excellent animation, nice humour, proper story progression, good pace, what more do you need?<br />
<br />
Overall(9/10):<br />
For me this was easily a higher 8 show. You don&#039;t often find such SOL shows which gets you invested in an instant and is so much enjoyable at the same time. I wish they continue this series in future as well. <br />
Lastly let&#039;s think whether you should watch this show/series or not <br />
_Do you like Slice of Life?<br />
_Do you like &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot;?<br />
_Do you like bright and cheerful anime?<br />
_Do you like mild fanservice which do not hinder your overall experience?<br />
_Do you like magic anime?<br />
_Do you like visually stunning anime fights?<br />
_Do you like overpowered characters?<br />
<br />
If your answer is yes to any of the above questions then just watch this show
