    So this is going to be a controversial review given the countless number of reviews giving the series a rating of 10. <br />
<br />
Something didn&#039;t click for me. What&#039;s not clicking, you ask? Good question. I wish I knew. <br />
<br />
Maybe it&#039;s the way that stories are disjointed. Maybe it&#039;s the way the story expects us to care about characters that we only knew for 2 episodes. Maybe it&#039;s the way that the world is hardly explained. Maybe it&#039;s the fact that Fushi is painfully slow for the creation of a &#039;god&#039;(?). Maybe it&#039;s the fact that every time the narrator speaks, all I can imagine is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398474">
        the beautiful face of Nanami Kento. <br />
<br />
Also, what&#039;s with everyone&#039;s half-assed reaction to meeting an immortal shapeshifter? <br />
<br />
I really wish I liked the season more because the premise is intriguing. Maybe I will as the season goes on so this review may change - keep your eyes out. <br />
<br />
But you know what? I&#039;m excited for the journey and I hope I change my mind, believe you me. <br />
<br />
1st Edit - I&#039;d hoped to have changed my review sooner but nothing changed between how I felt about the anime until now, at episode 11. This was one of the most engaging episodes of anime I&#039;ve ever seen and I hope that continues.

    Anyone who has read or seen Koe no Katachi (A Silent Voice) will recognize the name, Yoshitoki Ooima. To Your Eternity is her latest work that combines her artistic talent woven into a mesmeric story. To describe To Your Eternity is not simple. It&#039;s more than just a supernatural drama. It casts an emotional journey following an unique character And without a shadow of a doubt, To Your Eternity is among one of the best series I&#039;ve seen this year.<br />
<br />
When I first read the manga before the anime adaptation, I had anticipated various degrees of emotional drama. The author has been known to amplify human

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414866">
        emotions to tell and show a story. By doing so, she&#039;s able to communicate to the audience why characters are motivated by certain actions. That&#039;s no different when applied for To Your Eternity. The most prominent example applies to Fushi, a being with immortality who can transform into people and creatures. What&#039;s fascinating about Fushi is that the more transforms, he becomes more human. As we come to learn and understand about Fushi&#039;s character, we can draw upon how he changes. From interactions to his own personal motivations, Fushi is perhaps one of the most complex characters in the series.<br />
<br />
And that is to say, To Your Eternity is somewhat of a niche show. It&#039;s atypical even for a supernatural drama. Following Fushi&#039;s journey shows how alienated and ignorant he is about humanity. From the beginning, his attributes mirrors those of an animal. He is curious about the world around him but fails to understand certain elements. As he witness more realistic events in life (namely death), Fushi begins to understand the concept of humanity. And because he is immortal, death is not something he fears or even truly understands. Fushi initially reminds me of Doomsday, a character from the popular Superman comic books where what kills him makes him stronger. In this series, he adapts with death and revives even more after being killed over and over. But unlike Doomsday, Fushi becomes more compassionate and understanding about himself around others. And as every episode ventures on, we get to see his character evolution by embracing the essence of humanity. <br />
<br />
Throughout the show, Fushi meets and develops meanginful relationships among with his companions. The most prominent among these includes Gugu, Pioran, Tonari, and March. They act as surrogate family that shapes his character the more he interacts with them. In fact, he even received his name from March and without her, Fushi would be nameless. Being one of the kindest characters in the show, she accepts Fushi for who he is without judgment or prejudice. And thanks to her influence, we can say that Fushi matures into a more human character. Similarly, he develops a brotherly bond with Gugu and a sisterly relationship with Tonari. Both of these characters makes profound effects in his life as he grows to care and protect them. And because of his immortality, Fushi shows fearlessness when defending his companions. Perhaps the most guidance Fushi receives is from Pioarn, as she becomes his personal mentor. With her guidance, Fushi begins to learn the human language and how every action has a consequence, something he had been igornant of since his very existence.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Fushi, not everyone he meets is an ally or friend. These include the dangerous Nokkers (supernatural creatures in their world) he encounters or the obsessive Hayase. The latter evolves into a more twisted character, a polar opposite of Fushi&#039;s evolution. Indeed, Hayase represents the dark side of humanity. The way she fascinates about immortality and developing a twisted love for Fushi is what seperates her from any human character in the show. In later episodes, you can just see how far her obessesion carries with her beliefs. That being said, I think To Your Eternity is able to strike its character cast with such fascinating and colorful personalities. Every relevant characters brings an important part to Fushi&#039;s development, whether it&#039;s to shape him into more human or make him into a understanding character to us.<br />
<br />
Regardless how much you understand this show, it shouldn&#039;t take long for your eyes to see the unique aspect of the anime&#039;s animation quality. Brain&#039;s Base has been know for some of their noticable work including  My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU and Durarara!! In this show, they take on the approach to illustrate a fictional setting filled with emotional drama. The background scenes and chereography for its world fiction connects with its story tone. However, it is the emotional expressions of the cast that brings out the anime&#039;s drama at its finest. This is achieved through animating the behaviors and emotions for the characters. In particular, Fushi is the show&#039;s greatest achievement at showing human-like feelings. And lastly, the anime is known for some of its more mature content namely the violence and occasional sexual tone. This shouldn&#039;t distract the audience from the anime&#039;s overall presentation but it&#039;s still noticable in some episodes.<br />
<br />
To Your Eternity&#039;s stellar soundtrack also cannot be ignored if we look at how it synchronizes with its overall supernatural drama. From emotional melancholy to cherry orchestra, it&#039;s impressive how the soundtrack can further enhance the anime viewing experience. Fushi&#039;s voice also evolves from its toddler-like stuttering to a more mature human voice tone throughout the show. We can&#039;t ever forget how much of a character Fushi changes and it reminds us how important that change is.<br />
<br />
This is an anime of the year candidate and I&#039;m not joking. Even if you came into the series as a fresh viewer, it&#039;s going to be an unique experience for a supernatural drama. Let it be known that To Your Eternity sells its story exactly how it wants to with its creative character cast, unique storytelling, and ultimately, a show that touches upon the deepest elements of humanity.

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
A medieval fantasy show that revolves around a newborn immortal&#039;s adventures. It sounds exciting, right? I bet we will witness this immortal&#039;s amazing adventures while it grows as a person step by step. We will learn about this fantasy world which has lots of amazing stories for us, right?<br />
<br />
After all the hype from the manga readers and the fact this story has been written by the Koe no Katachi&#039;s author, my expectations were high. I was expecting a great adventure with excellent character development. But what did I get? A crap. Right after that cheesy first episode, I realized Fumetsu Anata e

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414862">
        is just another generic shounen-adventure show. However, I wanted to believe. I wanted to believe it will separate itself from other mediocre adventure shows with its next story arcs. Oh, how naive I was! It turned out that &quot;please cry!!!!!!&quot; episode was actually the best episode of the show, and I watched all the other 19 episodes with empty hopes.<br />
<br />
Fumetsu no Anata e has a lot of problems, but let&#039;s start with the story. This show doesn&#039;t know what it wants to be. After the first episode, I thought it will be an episodic show, but that&#039;s not the case. This 20-episode season has three different story arcs along with a prologue and an epilogue. The problem is these arcs don&#039;t have plots that can fill 4-6 episodes. Their worth is 3 episodes at best, and because of that every arc overstays its welcome and causes boring viewing experiences. They wouldn&#039;t be fun to watch even with low episode counts since they have badly-written stories though. Fumetsu no Anata e is a character-driven story in a fantasy world, but none of these arcs add anything notable to worldbuilding or brings decent character writings to the table. The show constantly gives new informations about its world but does absolutely nothing with them. Nothing would have changed if this was a historical story with supernatural elements rather than a story that sets in a world completely different from ours. And about the characters, let&#039;s talk about Fushi first.<br />
<br />
Our newborn immortal Fushi is an empty shell at the start of the story. It knows nothing about this world and tries to learn new things in its own way, and this makes it an amazing character for a coming of age story. The author can easily tell a wonderful character development story thanks to this character&#039;s nature, and she does that in the first 5 episodes. Fushi learns new things really slow just like a baby, and watching this character leisurely becomes a human was an amazing experience. And this was only the first quarter of the season. Even though the plotline in the first story arc was mediocre, I was excited to see Fushi&#039;s development in the next episodes. But then the first big disaster of Fumetsu happened. Suddenly a man in black appeared and started to talk about nonsense like &quot;wE hAvE a sAcReD MiSSiOn wE nEeD tO sAvE tHe wOrLd&quot; and I was like &quot;What the? Isn&#039;t this a coming of the age-adventure story? Why the fuck a budget Darth Sidious tries to make me watch a generic shounen-adventure?&quot; then a monster attacked to Fushi, and I became completely shocked. I understand some stories with an immortal MC need special foes that can kill or slow the immortal, but Fumetsu no Anata e isn&#039;t one of them. This story doesn&#039;t need the thrill of that. This story can carry the weight of slow-paced episodes, it doesn&#039;t need any action, especially horribly directed action. I was still in the &quot;believer&quot; mode even after this. I wanted to believe this monster will appear rarely and the story will keep focusing on Fushi&#039;s growth. But then, the second disaster happened, a time skip. We were watching Fushi&#039;s development at the perfect pace, Fushi finally got some people it can call a family and started to learn more things about being a human. However, after an unnecessary time skip, we saw Fushi finally became a proper person without seeing the process. It still got a mindset of a child, but it understands the world better. I completely lost all my hope about Fumetsu no Anata e after this nonsense. Fushi&#039;s development was supposed to be the main focus of the show, but the author threw it out of the window with an unnecessary time skip. I couldn&#039;t believe it. I couldn&#039;t believe the author of Koe no Katachi wrote something as laughable as this. And when we put Fushi aside, we don&#039;t have any good characters left. I&#039;ll skip all the supporting cast except for March, Gugu, and Tonari because these three are the main focuses of their story arcs.<br />
<br />
March is an annoying loud child. Her whole story is based on:<br />
&quot;I don&#039;t want to die! I want to live and grow up!&quot;<br />
*Fast forward to three episodes later*<br />
&quot;Oh no! I died! Cry for me!<br />
<br />
I felt bad for her... Fuck it. I won&#039;t act fake. She was so annoying and I didn&#039;t like her from the start, so I felt nothing after her death. Let&#039;s move to Gugu.<br />
<br />
Gugu&#039;s story is a mix of &quot;People stay away from him because of his monster-like appearance&quot; and &quot;rich girl poor boy&quot; clichés. The romantic relationship between him and Rean is a chore to watch, and his struggle to accept his new self without thinking about others&#039; thoughts on him has executed in the most generic way possible. I felt a little bit sad about his death, but it was like for 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
For Tonari, she&#039;s even more annoying than March at the start of her arc. She starts really selfish but becomes a better person towards the end of the arc. However, neither she nor her friends don&#039;t hold any weight. I guess the deaths of her friends should&#039;ve been somehow sad, but I couldn&#039;t focus on all the drama since I was busy laughing at how bad the scene was.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s all for the supporting cast. There&#039;s also Hayase, but I don&#039;t want to talk about her since she turned into an edgy character who makes me want to vomit every time she talks.<br />
<br />
If you saw some pictures from Fumetsu no Anata e on the internet and had thoughts like it&#039;s a good-looking show, set your expectations low. Those shots have been taken from really specific scenes. Fumetsu no Anata e mostly looks unpolished and under-detailed. There are some really good-looking scenes in the first episodes, but that&#039;s all. The same goes with animations, the first half of the show has good animations, but it falls flat in the second half. For example, the last fight scene in Gugu&#039;s arc has really bad animations, and unnecessary cuts kill all the fun. The sound quality is a bit better than the animations, but it&#039;s still not something I would call good. Voice actings are nice, but VAs can&#039;t make the important scenes look better than what they already are. I don&#039;t blame them though. You need the best actors and actresses in the industry for improving a show as bad as Fumetsu. The VAs in this show are good, but they are not the best ones. Soundtracks are the same too, they are okay but don&#039;t add anything to the viewing experience.<br />
<br />
Fumetsu no Anata e is a show with boring adventures, weak characters, mediocre production values, horrible worldbuilding, terribly directed action scenes, and wasted character developments. It&#039;s just another bad drama show which tries to make you cry about the characters you don&#039;t care. Maybe it could be something decent if the author didn&#039;t speedrun the most important part of Fushi&#039;s character development. But what we got is a horrible show that doesn&#039;t know what it wants to be.

    To Your Eternity is beautiful. Not because it is a masterpiece, but because it is a journey. A journey about an empty shell. A journey that delves into the brutal yet alluring qualities of human life. A journey filled with both joy and pain. The show starts off with one of the most beautifully condensed episodes, giving a taste of what it has to offer. It&#039;s emotional soundtrack compliments the intention of every scene, leaving a memorable impact for viewers. Brain&#039;s Base does an exceptional job in creating animations that fit the melancholic yet captivating setting. The subtle themes brought into the show only compliment

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
&quot;Fumetsu no Anata e&quot;, or &quot;To your Eternity&quot; (which I&#039;ll be calling TYE from now on) is an anime that perplexes me, it has the ideas to be a great series, but ultimately the execution of it fails horrendously, the final products ends up being a hideous joke. TYE has several problems and I&#039;m going to point most of them out:<br />
<br />
1- Tonal Shifts<br />
2- Annoying Characters<br />
3- Cheap drama<br />
4- Pacing<br />
5- Plot Conveniences<br />
6- Plot Holes<br />
7- Inconsistency<br />
8- Pointlessness<br />
9- Identity Crisis<br />
10- Visuals<br />
<br />
Starting with Tonal Shifts, this anime suffers from a thing most dramatic anime I&#039;ve seen do: Creating a tense or dramatic situation, just to make a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414869">
        joke right after. Now, I get adding comedy for the sake of relief, considering some series are very heavy on drama, but TYE abuses of this every time they can. Oh, we just revealed that a character is fated to die? Let’s add dead eyes and then proceed to ridicule the entire scene by making a character do a cartoonish tantrum that completely offsets the dramatic ambiance. This scene right here could have been powerful by only adding a tantrum of a character that doesn&#039;t know what awaits them and questioning the customs and the decisions of the tribe, but no, let&#039;s just make a visually cartoonish tantrum for the sake of doing so. This kind of things happens repeatedly and gets old pretty quickly. By the 3rd or 4th time this happened, I found myself rolling my eyes, because it&#039;s not even funny at this point, only adds to the frustration of a product that could have been actually emotional rather than a tone deaf one.<br />
<br />
Moving up to the next point, this anime has so many annoying characters on it, and boy, the focus of each arc is usually the most annoying one, and the worst part? They don&#039;t seem to use their brain at all. Oh, a character is about to get shot? oh don&#039;t worry, let me just jump and receive the shot myself, dying in the progress on a completely meaningless sacrifice that wasn&#039;t really needed, add salt to the injury considering that our MC, Fushi, had the power to avoid this, but sat still not doing anything until the worst happened, conveniently tragic. Fushi is actually the worst offender when it comes to annoying characters, he is as inconsistent as a third world country internet speed, and he is a walking contradiction filled with conveniences and plot holes. He should be very powerful, yet, he barely does anything and let’s people around him die for no reason but to add for shock factor. There is this scene where he decides to flee an island of criminals, acknowledging that said place is unredeemable, but at the very moment he&#039;s about to escape with its allegedly now girlfriend, then, the Knockers (our &quot;villains&quot;) attack and Fushi is somehow forced to help an island of criminals, because, oh boo hoo, poor things, they don&#039;t deserve this (after stating that this island is full of criminals mind you) and what does this achieve? Nothing, Fushi goes, fucks up, and gets himself 3 friends killed for no reason and then flees until it&#039;s convenient for him to do a &quot;heroic&quot; comeback and save the day. Another annoying character is a recurring one, Hayase, a god damn bitch that appeared on the 2nd arc, that somehow gets a very unhealthy obsession with Fushi after a time skip we didn&#039;t see, getting all powerful on a time skip we didn&#039;t see, killing and being on a rampage during a time skip we didn&#039;t see, who suddenly becomes the main antagonist of the final arc and boy, her whole persona is just extremely disgusting, incoherent and completely infuriating. Talking about her, she has some &quot;guards&quot; with her which are as great at guarding as potting plats, man, are this guards so damn stupid, blind and useless, it&#039;s as if they were paid actors because it&#039;s incredibly how negligent they are at their job, conveniently useless.<br />
<br />
Moving Forward, cheap drama, each arc has this side plot of a character that either is fated to die, or has an utterly tragic backstory on them, now, this is not bad by all means, there are some great anime out there that are great at creating characters like this and driving their story through character arcs like: Violet Evergarden, Kobato, Natsume Yuujinchou and many others, but the characters in TYE aren&#039;t memorable at all, and their backstory is often ridiculed by the tonal shifts I spoke about earlier, and the way the plot conveniently set up things adds to the feeling of being incredibly cheap it makes Clannad look like the second coming of God (I&#039;m not too fond of Clannad mind you), so not only the drama stinks, the characters and the plot direction is ridiculously bad where every faint good intention of trying to make you feel for a character is wasted.<br />
<br />
Next, pacing. Dear God, the pacing is very inconsistent, either it moves at snail pace, it does a time skip, or it moves pretty fast. The worst offender here is the time skip that happens during an arc, because it makes no sense, and from it comes a lot of conveniences that are never explained or explored properly (which I&#039;m gonna tackle later) During this time skip, Fushi ages and &quot;learns&quot; things, but then, all this is thrown to the garbage can after the nokkers attacked. The show goes like this: Introduction of a character, make that character know Fushi, attempt to make Fushi &quot;learn&quot; and bond with them, add tragedy, Fushi devolves as a character, Fushi conveniently makes a comeback and wins, then add more tragedy, rinse and repeat. Now, if only the plot and characters were coherent enough to make this edible, but all this bonding happens during very short time periods and it&#039;s constantly being thrown away in favor of inconsistency all thanks to the identity crisis this anime has (which I&#039;m gonna tackle later)<br />
<br />
Now, plot conveniences, plot holes, inconsistency and pointlesness. This show is filled with them to an alarming extent. Fushi being the center of it all. What is he? What limits does his power have? Is he an idiot? Is he useless? The answer to all of that is yes. We have no idea what he is but a creation of &quot;God&quot;. His powers has no limits, unless his brain capacity is on high demand, his powers have no limits as long as the plot demands it to, if the plot doesn&#039;t demand it, Fushi ends up being incredibly useless, letting characters die for no reason despite him having the means to succeed. Like when he battled against Hayase after the time skip, where he somehow loses against a human that got invaded by the spirit of a Yandere. It&#039;s all pointless.<br />
<br />
What did he do during March&#039;s arc? Nothing, he stood still, then tragedy happened and he reacts when it&#039;s already too late. What did he do during Gugu&#039;s arc? Nothing, he wasted YEARS doing nothing, there was an entire time skip and he did nothing, then people died again, and he made a comeback and won, what did he do during Tonari&#039;s arc? waste time again, he did nothing but participate on a half assed &quot;tournament&quot;, earning praise for no reason only to be taken away the moment Hayase is reintroduced to us again, where he again does nothing until everything is fucked, then he somehow gets useful again. What is the purpose of this character? He gets involved in people&#039;s life, just to let them down and kill them due to his own stupidity, it&#039;s all pointless.<br />
<br />
I swear, Fushi enters on other people&#039;s life only to make them miserable: March? Gets himself a yandere waifu and some stupid and pointless deaths. Gugu? Fuels jealousy, forces romance, a strange and pointless timeskip happens and gets all characters of this arc involved in the Knockers&#039; agenda. Tonari? Gets himself and a killer granny on an island of mindless criminal idiots, wastes time flirting with Tonari only to let her friends die, all because he didn&#039;t leave when he had the chance to do so. IT&#039;S A DAMN ISLAND FILLED WITH CRIMINALS FFS, How pointless this is?.<br />
<br />
Moving on, Fushi&#039;s power is inconsistently convenient, he&#039;s able to shapeshift into or create anything he had contact with: Arrows, food, weapons, you name it, even the &quot;friends&quot; he got killed, he&#039;s able to do all that without any consequence at all, he&#039;s able to do many things, yet, he falls short, his power conveniently is useless when people is dying, but is conveniently powerful when nothing matters anymore, it just doesn&#039;t make sense and it&#039;s never explored properly, it&#039;s just there, sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn&#039;t. By the start of the 4th arc, I&#039;ve lost hope on this anime, I tried really hard not to get biased against it, given that I chose to give it the benefit of the doubt trusting the anime would clarify things, but ultimately, the 4th arc is where things got completely stupid, it&#039;s where TYE problems became more evident... It&#039;s when it became an irredeemable trainwreck... You guessed it, a pointless trainwreck.<br />
<br />
We&#039;re almost finished with this abomination: Identity Crisis, and this is probably the worst offender of TYE, it doesn&#039;t know what it wants to be, at first, it looks like it wants to be a slice of life, making the MC interacting with people to grow, but then, it turns into a battle shounen, with power shenanigans and some stupid shit like the Knockers, powers are not explained properly, they just work and without consequence. The aftermath? nothing, Fushi doesn&#039;t grow, he gets people killed, he steal their &quot;powers&quot; (and by power I mean their body and whichever shenanigan they had, like Gugu&#039;s hilarious fire breath technique), he then acts like if their deaths meant anything but in reality it never did. During a fight, Fushi is beated to a pulp like a bitch, but either he manages to escape or wins somehow. He never trains, he doesn&#039;t polish his abilities, He even claims to be powerless, becoming a crybaby, focused on not killing because &quot;it&#039;s bad&quot;, which, ultimately, makes him way more useless, but he never grows or learns from this, he keeps screwing up until it somehow works for him.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s something so inept into trying to glorify not killing people, which becomes incredibly stupid considering that Fushi gets people killed because of that mindset. What is taking a single life, out of someone or something that killed several? Will you risk getting those you love killed just because you have this pretentious thought of being a child of light that doesn&#039;t kill anyone? Spare me the thought please, this is so stupid, by not taking action you&#039;re letting others get killed, which adds to your toll and you&#039;ll feel like shit anyway. Let me quote HBO&#039;s Chernobyl real quick: &quot;you put a bullet in someone, you&#039;re not you anymore. You&#039;ll never be you again. But then you wake up the next morning and you&#039;re still you, and you realize that was you all along. You just didn’t know&quot;... We have to get rid of characters that are so scared of confronting someone due to the scary thought of killing someone, it&#039;s ultimately very fake and will only get more people killed. <br />
<br />
Last but not least the visuals, dear God, what in tarnation is happening on Japan? It&#039;s horrifying to think about the conditions and deadlines the poor animators have to endure to animate something like this, whoever directed this should be imprisoned. The art style and animation heavily declines in the 2nd half, especially during the last arc, where you see a wide shot of CG zombies, on a terrain that has no depth of field, no shadows and janky movement, it makes the zombies look like they&#039;re floating. I&#039;m not going to criticize the animators, but whoever is in charge of directing and whoever is in the higher ups that decided the deadline for this anime. Animation in Japan is heavily declining, and destroying the poor animators life with deadlines and horrible salary is hardly the answer. We&#039;ve already seen controversy in Cloverworks with Wonder Egg Priority, and recently, studio Mappa and others where these issues are getting more evident, looking at animation videos from talented people in YouTube looks like it&#039;s a work of passion, but when you get to know about the awful reality behind the industry it&#039;s sad to see that talent is getting wasted in favor of exploiting their workers on a terrible schedule, hopefully this changes someday.<br />
<br />
I have nothing to say about the audio department, because honestly, it barely has any impact to my overall feelings about this trainwreck, the OST for me was only relevant during the first episode (which was the best one sadly), and after that, nothing else came close. It&#039;s hard to believe this work was made by the same author of A Silent Voice, what a complete and disappointing trainwreck. <br />

    If you’ve ever experienced the death of a loved one, you know the feeling that To Your Eternity seeks to evoke in its audience. Several times I found myself sobbing, and it gave me an outlet to release the pent-up sadness I’ve held from the deaths of people I loved. <br />
<br />
To Your Eternity follows an immortal being named Fushi who assumes the form of dead humans and animals he encounters along his journey. He can transform into them at will. A few are a giant bear, a girl who can climb trees, and a wolf. Though he is immortal, he has fears and things to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414870">
        lose. He befriends kind people and fears losing his memories of them. There is a forest monster who can steal his forms, along with the memories. While fighting murders, warriors, and monsters, he utilizes his toolbelt of fallen friends. The high concept premise makes for enthralling action. Although the manga was published in a shounen magazine, it has a relatively slow pace, making the action feel monumental rather than inevitable. In one moment, Fushi is a wolf to lunge at his enemy, and in the next he becomes a massive bear to stomp on them. There&#039;s a set-piece with dazzling animation in every other episode; explosions, collapsing buildings, blood, and gore. Studio Brain’s Base has a collection of talented animators, artists, and editors who put their best work into this show. Whether it be time or budget constraints, the art quality becomes more simplified as the series progresses. Even at its least impressive, it stands above the studio&#039;s prior works like In/Spectre.<br />
<br />
Any anime that succeeds at making me cry has a special place in my heart. This show made me cry… A lot. The first and the twelfth episodes hurt the most because I was emotionally invested in the people Fushi met. The story begins with him meeting a boy who has lived alone in a snowstorm for 5 years, waiting for his family to return. If that sounds sad to you, it gets a lot more depressing. Seeing their goals, aspirations, hopes, and dreams become wasted upon their death shook me. For the main cast, death is a meaningful tool used to evoke catharsis. Some may call it emotionally manipulative, but for me, it works due to the stellar execution. Though you will witness plenty of violence, the artists do not linger on blood or suffering upon an emotional death. Once the moment passes, we see whoever died glowing in the afterlife. Realization sets in that they&#039;re gone, and it hits you like a ton of bricks. What happens after that is left to our interpretation. I would go so far as to say the framing is sensitive. Accusations of misery porn have no place in these parts. Personally, I recommend against watching the anime’s opening theme because the visuals contain spoilers all the way until the last episode. If you mistakenly watch it like I did, you’ll find the deaths pretty unsurprising. <br />
<br />
I need to praise the voice actors and script for this. Especially Fushi’s VA who went from babbling like a baby at the start to slowly learning the language with a slight stutter. That’s what he needed to sell an alien being transforming from a rock to a fully sentient human. In the first two arcs, the characters felt real. Their dialogue was natural, they reacted to the world believably, and their struggles kept me waiting to see what would happen next episode. <br />
<br />
Nothing lasts forever, not life nor To Your Eternity&#039;s writing quality: Flat characters, intrusive narration, weak storytelling, hammy dialogue, and forced drama plague the underwhelming second half. For the remaining eight episodes, the surfaces were flat as cardboard cutouts. The show&#039;s final arc jammed in a dozen new people with any characterization, and it expects us to remember their names. Even the sensitive portrayal of death I praised became watered down. Using sad music, tears, and afterlife imagery should be used to make a tragic death more impactful, not trick us into caring about a character who had barely any dialogue and no development. That&#039;s emotionally manipulative. Despite this, the first two arcs prove that big-budget anime productions can adapt poignant anime in a market that prioritizes adapting generic isekai light novels. <br />
<br />
Each chapter of Fushi&#039;s journey isn&#039;t tied together with an overarching plot. What we have instead is a constant threat of danger, the unpredictable monster chasing after his memories. Around halfway through, we get a vague, amorphous antagonist with unclear motives explained in a tiresome exposition dump. I always appreciated Fumetsu no Anata e for not overcomplicating its high concept premise until it did.<br />
<br />
Throughout the whole show, there is a narrator. Around the halfway point, he becomes a visible man who interacts with Fushi. Looking like a cultist, he shows up wearing a black hood whenever Fushi needs guidance, or rather when the story feels like it&#039;s time for exposition. The story tends to overcomplicate itself through the narrator; he explains the rules of Fushi&#039;s supernatural powers and arbitrarily tells us what the true antagonist&#039;s motives are. Fushi could&#039;ve confronted the antagonist, then discovered its motivations. Or, they could&#039;ve left that information vague, as it had been. Being spoon-fed lore and character motives feel forced. Eternity has plenty of death and mature themes. Spoon feeding the viewers with exposition in an R-rated show is like a mother feeding a teenager baby food.<br />
<br />
Fushi has the mind of an infant at the beginning. Seeing him learn how to be human as the months pass by is compelling. I assumed the whole story would consist of him learning to become human, but that development happens relatively quickly. For the rest of the story, we have a protagonist with a mundane personality. He goes from an intriguing mystery to a heroic traveler. His motives are clear—save whoever his person of interest is at any given time. Due to the spoilers in the opening theme, you sort of know things won&#039;t always go as planned. Shortly put: once he gained a personality, I didn&#039;t like him. How compelling is a guy whose reason for living is to save people in danger when he&#039;s at no risk of dying? Well, &quot;no risk&quot; isn&#039;t entirely true. The amorphous antagonist introduced early on threatens to steal Fushi&#039;s deceased friends, along with his memories of them. Fearing that Fushi would lose a character I liked kept my interest in the underwhelming final episodes. <br />
<br />
To Your Eternity has a truly poignant message at its core; even after we die, the people we leave behind will remember us. Ironically, it is a forgettable show in the end.

    [Spoiler warning for 6 episodes]<br />
To start off, I just want to say I am glad I started watching To Your Eternity. Its beautiful.<br />
<br />
Story (10/10) -<br />
The premise of this new series is one of the most creatively unique I have seen. Your average anime might have a completely realistic setting, or a completely surreal one, with a magic system and its whole world shaped by it. To Your eternity places an orb, a character of such a surreal world, in the real world. This premise is so creative, unique and inspiring, as it as so much potential, with its world, its inhabitants and the themes which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398258">
        can be explored through the characters, and learning about emotions. I love this premise, and I really hope they pay it off well, as they have so far.<br />
The first episode. What can I say about it. When I think of a perfect episode and pilot, this is what I mean. Not many things make me as emotional as this did. The amazing writing within this helped me connect so well so fast, it was truly amazing. Though it was quite predictable, it doesnt matter. Its the beauty in how one episode can make me connect so well with its story that resonates with me.<br />
After this first episode, the story we follow is interesting as well. However, since the arc has not finished airing as yet, I dont know how it will turn out. My expectations are high though, yet I&#039;m sure the show ill exceed them.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation (9/10) -<br />
The episodes look amazing. I love the white aesthetic of the first episode, and the colours look even better in the next few. Nothing feels forced, incomplete, or even just competent. Even in the animation, everything feels purposeful, intentional, and looks beautiful. Even subtle movements and reactions are captured well. I love the overall look.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10) -<br />
It amazing that the lowest score in a criteria I&#039;m giving is an 8. The score and the opening song are engaging and add to the ongoing action and episode overall. Though there is nothing groundbreaking, the sound mixing does a great job of making me feel part of the world, and I like the overall sound.<br />
<br />
Character (10/10) -<br />
The Orb/Wolf - This character has the most interesting premise. As an emotionless inanimate object turned animal turned human, it is amazing to see its reactions to human emotions, and I&#039;m sure itll be touching to see it understand and learn to feel the same.<br />
The unnamed boy with white hair - What can I even say about him. His character was what I got attached to at the start. The endless optimism in a dreadful and tragic situation is a character trait I love, and because of it, I really enjoyed his character. I was actively dreading his death from the first few scenes we spend with him. I also loved how he appreciated his pet wolf, especially as it was the only thing who gave him company. I was invested in this relationship as well. His motivation came from many things including the search of paradise, his tribes unwillingness to let him come, and later on, his tribes remains. These factors and its effects on him were beautiful, and strikingly real and heartfelt. I was so invested in him, knowing he would most likely die, in such a short period of time. This just shows the masterful writing behind his character, and the show. I cannot wait for more of this.<br />
March (and also her &#039;sister&#039;) - I am already invested in her character. She is young and immature, but genuine and fun. I love her empathy towards the orb/wolf in their interactions, as well as her impatience to grow up. I think they established her character very well, and she has the potential to have an amazing character growth arc. Her elder sister is engaging too, and I like her, despite her not being as well established.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10) -<br />
I consider the pilot episode to be a masterpiece. I expect this show will turn out to be a masterpiece. I think its obvious that my enjoyment is 10/10. I have enjoyed every second of this show, have felt what it wanted me to feel, and look forward to it with great expectations.<br />
<br />
Overall (10/10) -<br />
I think it might be a bit unfair to give it an overall 10 instead of a 9, as the show is not even complete yet. However, I know an amazing show when I see one. This has the potential to be one. Not only is it enjoyable, but it seems as if every person working on it is giving it their all, from writers to animators, to produce this, I&#039;m sure to be, masterpiece. I cannot recommend it enough.<br />
<br />
I hope you found this review helpful.

    SPOILER ALERT<br />
<br />
Right from the title of the film, we have felt somewhat the mystery and magic hidden deep in its content. Not following any of the paths of fantasy-genre anime that chew on the same script over and over again, each frame that appears throughout the anime maintains a stable quality enough to attract viewers to an open world without anyone has ever aspired to travel through space and each character in the film, whether major or minor, has its own mark, has a certain depth to impress the audience with their presence. So what specifically must be so impressive that anyone who has watched

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398366">
        says this is a MASTERPIECE?<br />
  <br />
The main character is unique, he is soulless but sympathetic. Not a normal human, just an inanimate ball like a slime that was planted on the earth by the &quot;CREATOR&quot;. Not only is it immortal with time, but it is also given the ability to absorb the bodies and wills of dead creatures. It not only takes over the body, but also inherits the desires of the organism it absorbs, lives like a BABY, walks into life, learns actively. accumulate life instincts and common sense from the smallest microorganisms to human intelligence. Then, after having combined all the bodies and minds of those who had absorbed it, the inanimate sphere had thought like a HUMAN and began to search for the meaning of his life.<br />
 <br />
 HUMANS ONLY DIE WHEN BEING FORGET. Throughout the film, viewers are always inhibited when any character(or mostly side character), those to know or is close to the MC, will die suddenly (or die of old age). But each death has its own meaning, and the main character is the one who fulfills the will of the deceased. The wolf died in the cold snowy night due to excessive blood loss, main absorbed the dog and inherited the will to return to the warm wooden house with the owner. Or when the boy died alone while suffering the injury&#039;s pain, the main character also absorbed that boy and started his journey to travel everywhere, eating delicious foods, meeting people of other civilizations, escape from this lonely cold snowy mountain area to enjoy the natural land of luxuriant green trees full of vitality. It can be said that the side characters didn’t die, they always LIVE IN MAIN CHARACTER’S HEART, FUFFILING THEIR WISHED. Each death we are impressed in a different way, regretful when the wish cannot be fulfilled, but satisfied when our death has saved the life of the person we love. Unfortunately, the length of the film did not allow viewers to stick with the supporting character long enough to feel the full depth of the character.<br />
 <br />
 DEAD PEOPLE DON&#039;T KNOW THAT ONLY THE PAIN WILL STAY WITH THE PEOPLE WHO STILL ALIVE. The story is fictional but very close to reality, life is never rosy, but full of hidden tragedy. Throughout his journey, the main character not only develops his rational mind but also his human emotions. Watching your best friend die with tears in your eyes, cherishing every fragile life of a creature and hating your own ability to absorb a dead host. Those who stay alive are not better, they suffer watching their loved ones die without being able to do anything, tormenting themselves like the one who caused that unjust death. But after all, everyone has to live and live well for the part of the person who sacrificed for them. Thought it was a vague feeling, but it was actually very understandable, like your gratitude to the soldiers and martyrs who fell to win the country&#039;s independence and peace for future descendants. A very humane message.<br />
<br />
 An anime series that is really worth watching that you should not miss, unique in content, does not follow any path, is simple to watch, but the content has incredible depth. Have fun watching:)) I may rewrite my review when the Anime come to the end, so a 9 for now<br />

    To Your Eternity is a story about life. The struggles, the memories, the people we meet.<br />
<br />
As a whole, To Your Eternity initially does a solid job at presenting such events and ideas, from what I have seen of it in the past, it plays well with this whole journey concept it has going for itself. It doesn&#039;t feel half-hearted, the characters are believable, and for the most part, it was something to look forward to as you sway your way into the oncoming episodes. This, however, is true until it isn&#039;t. The latter half of the story sure goes on the same initial path as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414860">
        the first, however, with a substantial objective of the former half somewhat achieved (basically intelligence acquired), the story had to drive itself around a new fundamental for storytelling, which it did, but the result was lazy writing. It was evident that the writers didn&#039;t even try to fish out new ideas and instead resorted to &quot;generic&quot; ideas, generic isn&#039;t bad, but I&#039;d say a poor shift is. The characters themselves felt like they were for the wrong demographic too, with random shounen-esque ideas coming for the sake of &quot;there was nothing else to do&quot;, when in fact, the initial dark side would come and go when it was conveniently called for. It&#039;s a sad downfall, but it isn&#039;t one of a catastrophe, just one that didn&#039;t hold up to what some could consider an &quot;initial lie&quot;.<br />
<br />
The audiovisuals are relativity consistent, you know, they looked nice and sounded good, as they should, the general. That is until the latter half where if you are astute, you&#039;d notice the drop in animation quality, it shouldn&#039;t hinder overall experience, in fact, it will only hinder if you care about it too much, however that is not to say it passes as a fault in my eyes. Maybe there were some background issues going on around this one, I don&#039;t have the information on me to come to such a conclusion, but considering the work ethics of studios, I think an educated guess shouldn&#039;t misinform people too much, though it&#039;s not like that&#039;s directly related to the final product anyway.<br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s a fun and interesting experience, that had its faults, sure, so much so that I could not possibly call this a masterpiece or those other fancy words I am too dumb to understand. The anime got me thinking about the themes it had for itself, mostly relative in its anime universe, not superimposed onto a reality. But it does get you some thought as to, what you would do if you were in the same position. Is immortality a blessing or a curse for humans? Well, that&#039;s for another time.

    This feels like misery porn to me. [No Spoilers]<br />
<br />
I was very excited to watch this because the presentation and music seemed incredible. It really is very pretty and animated well.<br />
<br />
However, thematically I&#039;m not taking away anything from the characters nor the plot. If I had to come up with something, I would say the message that I got was &quot;wouldn&#039;t it suck if this happened&quot; or &quot;this person experienced a difficult life but still kept going&quot;. <br />
<br />
It definitely hurts even physically to watch the characters struggle through horrendous situations. It definitely makes you feel for the characters. <br />
<br />
But I feel like the misery is just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400341">
        dialed up to 10 to elicit strong emotions out of you, but for what reason?<br />
<br />
I kept watching expecting for there to be some payoff or catharsis or introspection, but 7 episodes in the show hasn&#039;t delivered that to me.<br />
<br />
I would say the only thing about the show that I enjoyed was seeing different characters teach and nurture the main character. There are definitely some endearing characters. But I continue to watch with a pit in my stomach because I know those characters are going to suffer horrendously<br />
<br />
I keep asking myself every episode, what is the point of this? Why are these characters suffering? What is the show trying to convey? And my conclusion tends to be that functionally it&#039;s emotionally tugging at my heartstrings and its substantively delivering close to nothing else.<br />
<br />
I just don&#039;t feel that I need to watch stories about people suffering to understand life is hell for a lot of people. <br />
<br />
I really hope that the show will provide something substantive as the season progresses. I&#039;ll update my review when the season ends.

    Delusion amidst incessant desolation. An upbeat child rests, dreaming of an unattainable paradise, the warmth of human companionship, an escape from the frigid barren— a metaphoric graveyard. Cheerful despite the harsh circumstances until cold, melancholic isolation begins to set. Orchestrally triumphant, an instrumental whirlwind envelopes the boy as he journeys out into the white night. Gradually, faced with adversity, his optimistic facade is demolished, revealing blind insanity in misguided perseverance. Increasingly ominous, an expression of self-denial collapsing into anguish and despair lamenting the unattainable fading aspirations. A quiet whimper concludes the premiere, &quot;remember me.&quot; The occupying empty, unfeeling vessel descends, striving to discover humanistic emotion,

What a spectacular, heart-wrenching, single-episode OVA this was, indeed, a classic; thank god that Nineteen other abhorrently contrived, emotionally tactless episodes, intolerably recycling similar rhetoric, don&#039;t follow. Yessir, no incongruous psychotic face-licking Yanderes here, no siree bob! <br />
<br />
Even if there were more episodes hypothetically, the quality would have to severely dwindle for an appropriate rating of, let&#039;s say, Two to be applicable. Not just a piddling shamble towards the conclusion, but a viscerally, unbridled-rage crawl only attainable if an Onikuma sized beartrap lacerated almost all appendages, rendering the series a metaphorical Anakin Skywalker: childishly flailing its&#039; monotonous ideologies and sophomoric thematics, only to fall on deaf ears of the viewer, the Obi-Wan in this example, as they look in dismay and disgust at what could have been the chosen one, but ended up as indigestible trite. So, repeatedly stating, there was mercifully only one episode.

    Any anime fan should know very well that with any piece of fiction, emotions can be a wonderful thing and make a series amazing, and the anime industry is well aware of that. When any story is able to effectively utilize many different kinds of emotions, it will definitely succeed. With that being said, To Your Eternity’s unique style is quite appealing, and most people get interested in this, hence its high popularity and reception, but it’s that very same characteristic that also brings it down. As someone who’s watched A Silent Voice from the very same author of this series, I’m shocked by how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414906">
        much praise this show got, and honestly, I don’t think most of that is even remotely warranted.<br />
<br />
To Your Eternity is unsurprisingly deceptive. It markets itself as an allegedly deep and evocative series with a novel premise and sports neat-sounding themes like stimulation, survival, loss, and humanization. Set with an almost completely ethereal fantasy setting, it promises a compelling and philosophical journey about an empty husk developing and becoming a sentimental individual through the involvement of other people and events along the way.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the sad truth is that To Your Eternity is an astoundingly colorless exemplification of using emotional manipulation and exploitation in some of the most unappetizing and clumsiest ways possible. Whatever messages or themes it may have tried to convey are simply wasted or almost never touched upon in any meaningful way, as it loses itself within a delirious identity crisis. I’m not being unaware of whatever moral or ideology the show is trying to tell or express to me; what presented before me is just nothing remotely remarkable or impressive, and simply falls pointlessly on deaf ears. <br />
<br />
The premise presents us with an otherworldly being, simply referred to as “the Orb”, being sent to Earth to be observed from afar. Having the power to take on the forms of other living things through interacting and resonating with them via “simulation”, it would later be known as “Fushi” (meaning “immortal”), and the series follows its journey of meeting and interacting with people as well as its developing sense of humanity along the way. <br />
<br />
The very first episode of To Your Eternity by itself is essentially a prologue, and honestly, it’s not bad by itself. It was simple, distilled, and straightforward enough to be able to embody and transmit its intended themes and messages and foster endearing character interactions and emotions within a very short amount of time in what I consider to be a self-contained narrative. The premiere’s capability to generate sympathy and empathy as well as to raise the interest of the audience did well enough to cover for any drawbacks it did have. No matter how many times one looks at it, Episode 1 could’ve and should’ve been a standalone OVA by all means, and from there, viewers would’ve been presented with the opportunity to come up with their own interpretations of it and what may come afterwards. I believe that would be an ideal way to present this unique premise. That would not be the case, sadly. It was all downhill from there, instead. What started out fairly well became something else I could no longer recognize as its former self, whether it was intentional or not.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest drawbacks of To Your Eternity is how it utilizes the method of emotional manipulation. Its choice of usage is of the typical monotonous variety: it introduces characters and superficially fleshes them out for the sheer sake of literally sending them to the slaughterhouse. Each time a new character is presented to us, the show takes the liberty in its attempts to get us attached to them. It’s apparently easy to get baited by this because of how cliché and easy it is to chew on, despite how painfully repetitive it gets. The series consistently fails to give us any genuine and deeper incentive for us to care about them. It’s trying to make us feel strong emotions for them, but for what purpose? Is it to gratify how important they are in nurturing and developing Fushi, directly or indirectly? Is it because they’re supposedly well-written characters by themselves, besides being given next to nothing remotely noteworthy? Is it to pound home the notion that Fushi is literally carrying on their memories or “legacy”? If it’s any of those, the show doesn’t seem to transmit the intentions well. <br />
<br />
To Your Eternity’s formula is like this: introduce Fushi to a new character, get them attached to each other, add some trauma or tragedy, Fushi regresses only to bounce back at the last moment, add more tragedy on the tail end for the sake of his “simulation”, then rinse and repeat. There’s no innovation and creativity to be found here, more like one’s humdrum daily routine of getting up to go to work or school every day with no variation or detour within. The repetitive execution of this series is like a newborn baby deer, clumsy in its emotional beats and inserted humor, the latter of which I found especially annoying. The comedy in the series almost always manages to be obstructive, awkward, and unfunny, especially when it’s inserted right alongside the more tense segments. For example, one of the main characters, March, is informed that she is going to be sacrificed as part of a ritual to appease a deity figure. As the segment attempts to switch to a more serious tone with even a somber soundtrack playing in the background, we then see March displayed in a visually comical manner as she whines and cries about it while hitting someone in Looney Tunes style. I can’t tell you how much that evaporates the intended atmosphere of that moment when the series is trying to be something mature. Another good example would be involving Gugu, yet another recurring character set up for incoming disaster. We are given his backstory as to why he wears a mask and why he’s so isolated, which is supposed to give a sense of depth to his role. The show then presents a silly juxtaposition where he literally goes gaga for a girl named Rean in typical cringy romantic comedy fashion. What am I supposed to get out of this ridiculous tone shifts? Forced empathy? Humor? Or both? None of the above, in all honesty. I’m not sure how I can even begin to start feeling for a character when a series commits tone-deaf implementations like this. <br />
<br />
To Your Eternity seems hell bent on wanting to throw excessive shock value and put characters through copious amounts of needless drama and suffering, and it gets repetitive and predictable very quickly. Every time it does so comes of as far more exploitative than genuine. There’s no subtlety to be found within the hamfisted loads of theatrics and reinforced notions of torturing characters one after another. Whoever Fushi befriends during his journey is bound for suffering in one way or another, and almost all the time it ends with their demise. Emotional manipulation by itself isn’t necessarily bad, but how it’s utilized can beget many issues. When used the right way by pairing it up with profound messages and efficient thematic presentations, it can turn out extremely powerful and well-earned. What To Your Eternity does here, on the other hand, is essentially akin to taking farmed or factory-raised animals, feeding and fattening them up purely for slaughter, and then bluntly telling us as viewers to feel sad for them, as it presents their meat as an entree for us to eat it. Wouldn’t this feel awkward, especially when the series commits it repeatedly in a seemingly apathetic manner? Why not resort to other more efficient ways to elicit emotions regarding these characters, instead of just these silly cases of “misery porn”? This sort of presentation is something I cannot consider as sentimental and grounded, and it befuddles me as to how anyone can get up in the feels watching such disjointed and discombobulated sequences like that. Because of how badly this show utilizes emotional manipulation I couldn’t feel anything remotely close to being sad. I chuckled and laughed a few times at the comical inane displays. I honestly feel like this choice and formula of writing would’ve worked out fine in a fantasy novel instead, not in anime or manga form.<br />
<br />
The pacing of the story is very inconsistent. It moves at a sluggish pace with short bursts, including an oddly implemented timeskip. The segments are prolonged to extend the mindless suffering as well as forcing us to stay longer with characters that are only there to be set up for disaster. For me, personally, the longer duration served to increase my sense of irritation, as I personally find most of the cast extremely uninteresting and annoying.<br />
<br />
Plot conveniences and impracticalities are perhaps the most glaring issues with To Your Eternity. There’s so many of them that it’s extremely hard to ignore their constant obstruction even if one attempts to turn a blind eye to all of them. It’s amusing how many there are and how hard it is to choose one to poke fun at. But the most straightforward cases involve Fushi himself. For example, Fushi is said to take the form of living things he’s became attached to, but somehow he’s also able to manifest…..food? Weapons? Anything non-living with a tangible form that he recognizes? Without any particular repercussions? Whatever explanation the series attempts to give to us regarding this is more or less a cheap way out. I’m not asking for any immediate and complete breakdown, but without any decent answer, we’re forced to roll with whatever is pulled out of that magic hat. The way Fushi’s abilities are handled for the sake of the plot is also quite deplorable. When he needs them the most, they conveniently become useless, and when the stakes are no longer high anymore, usually due to someone close to him already at or through death’s door, they become effective again. It feels like as Fushi is like a curse to anyone whom he meets due to these rigged displays. Another case of hilarious plot convenience is how Gugu manages to defeat an enemy singledhandedly by just...blasting it to bits with a single fire-breath. Yes, an enemy that Fushi is outright defeated by prior to Gugu coming to the rescue. It’s hard to take anything from the show seriously when this kind of silly plotting alongside the awful tone shifts are constantly recurring. Can such a silly presentation like this here be equaled out by something deep and profound like compelling themes and worldbuilding? Yes, but we don’t have any of that here whatsoever. One more example: how is it that literally everyone’s reaction to Fushi being a shapeshifting immortal is so deadpan and half-assed? No realistic reaction whatsoever. It’s almost like they be seeing abnormal and supernatural things on a regular basis. None of the characters act rationally at all, they only move in accordance to what the story demands.<br />
<br />
Speaking of worldbuilding, there’s a need to touch upon the biggest elephant in the room: To Your Eternity’s disgraceful case of an identity crisis. To put it simply, this show doesn’t frigging know if it wants to be more so a battle shounen or a fantasy drama. Fushi was apparently placed upon the world and assigned to save and defend it from unknown invaders. This poor thing with literally no initial emotions or incentive was essentially dropped in the middle of nowhere and given a child’s tool set, with his mystical Darth Sith-looking creator (also the narrator) saying “here, fix this crap, while I observe from afar”. What the hell was that? That’s supposed to be part of good storybuilding? Yoshitoki Oima’s kind of writing works more for steady-paced episodes full of well-earned and drama, not randomly implemented shounen-style plotting, tropes, and action. The action itself looked visually awful, anyways. The implementation of the mysterious Nokker entities as the enemy is so jarring and boring at the same time. They serve no good purpose other than to randomly show up and contribute more to the show’s silly theatrics. Why implement the idea of needing to save Earth from these random aliens? How is this supposed to have contribution to Fushi’s story? The constant recurring implementation of conflict takes us out of the chances of slowly building the world itself from the ground up, especially like exploring the details of the settings themselves. All that nonsense with “saving the world” could’ve been completely omitted and the story would’ve been far better off. As the show randomly fumbles with its multiple personality disorder, Fushi’s character growth is continually hindered and rendered inconsistent; in fact, the timeskip I mentioned earlier served to completely omit the visual presentation of seeing him grow through the years with a group of people he considered as something akin to family. The intent of the story was to center on showing Fushi’s development and yet we as an audience are denied seeing any satisfying highlights of such.<br />
<br />
As if To Your Eternity wasn’t already lacking in many areas already, the second half is even more diabolical in terms of writing and what ultimately had me firmly putting my foot down on it. The series  then resorts to some of the most blatantly offensive and forced edgy context I’ve ever seen in quite some time. Fushi is forced onto some prison island and into some ridiculous gladiator tournament; what’s even worse is that an old acquaintance named Hayase comes after him. To add salt to the wound, Fushi outright loses to her despite the latter being a normal human being. Why is this obnoxious character supposed to be relevant? Her obsession and motives behind pursuing Fushi are hilariously shallow and contrived. The show had the gall to make Hayase one of the edgiest and unlikable characters around; hell she even makes Sugou’s case in Sword Art Online look far better and that says a lot, considering at least the latter had some actual prior buildup before going psycho himself. That’s not the same case for this deplorable fiend in Hayase here. What was the point of needing to implement this atrocity? How is all of this supposed to be building Fushi’s character? If anything, it actually made him look immensely pathetic, especially when all the sudden he wants to be a pacifist because he thinks he “killed people” simply because he got involved with their lives. While he may be right, the way he addresses and approaches this realization is too impractical and contrived to feel relatable and understandable. Watching that whole second half had me continually more baffled at how this is somehow from the same person behind A Silent Voice. While the very last episode does seem to manage to make a few amends, the damage from everything in between has already been dealt and is too immense to bear.<br />
<br />
The characters I’ve already touched upon a small handful of times already, and other than Fushi, even the featured support cast are nothing particularly remarkable at all. They’re just easily appealing one-dimensional character archetypes shallowly written as mere fuel for Fushi’s progression. March is your typical annoying and overly vocal child spouting dreams about wanting to be the ideal mother. Gugu’s characterization is riddled by the ungainly clichés of being treated as something foreign and monstrous and being part of the good old cliché of “rich meets poor and they fall in love”. His romance with Rean was like watching a comedian trying to do a stand-up session with the most cringe jokes possible. Tonari had a semi-decent segment, from being selfish to becoming more compassionate and considerate; however, even with her cheaply inserted backstory, she and her friends have no weight to their character and hence nearly zero reason for me to care. It’s even worse when the demise of her friends is something that’s supposed to be sad, but came off as comical, instead, due to how awful looking it was. Fushi himself is supposed to be the perfect character for a coming-of-age story to be experience the best kinds of development and growth throughout his journey, but the copious amounts of bad plotting, inane drama, and laughable attempts at empathy seems to regularly tamper with this. As a result, I didn’t particularly like how inconsistent it ended up being in the end.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I need to get to the visuals and the audio. The soundtracks are quite fine by themselves, maintaining a decent sense of atmosphere, but they seem lukewarm to me, so I can’t say they really contribute anything notable enough in terming of viewing experience. The opening theme in particular was honestly quite nice by itself, but nothing particularly memorable or remarkable to me; honestly, I don’t even think its upbeat tempo really befits the series, anyway.<br />
But oh geezus, the visuals. What the hell happened? To anyone thinking Brain’s Base is gonna give consistently solid aesthetic quality, please lower your expectations. While it doesn’t start off looking too bad, To Your Eternity’s animation is mostly unpolished and lacking in constant details. There’s many unnecessary jump cuts that take away from the more impactful scenes. The second half in particular, is just an absolute disaster; untimely production issues, overworking and burnout by the animation staff resulted in countless derp-looking sequences, including janky CGI, messy-looking character designs, backgrounds with no notable sense of depth or dimension. As much as the voice actors did all they can to make the scenes look good, they can only do so much.<br />
<br />
As if you can’t already tell, I didn’t enjoy this trip at all after the first episode. My enjoyment levels continually dropped with each episode as the series became more and more redundant and predictable. There was still notable incentive for me to continue watching, but I can’t say I got much positive, if at all. I previously stated that I got annoyed with nearly every one of the characters, but the one I hated most was, to nobody’s surprise, the inserted antagonist Hayase. I’m not gonna lie when I say I nearly threw up when I saw her try to sexually assault Fushi and do that...grotesque tongue licking. That was just revolting. Again, why in the god damn hell is something like this supposed to be necessary? What was Yoshitoki thinking when she was writing this part? Perhaps I’ll never know, but it again pains me to know that this sort of abysmal writing came from her of all people.<br />
<br />
To sum it up, To Your Eternity is a show that wasted so much potential. It baits you with the promise of a touching and mature story about an empty shell growing and becoming human, but instead presents to you a childish incomprehensible amalgamation of loose parts. Riddled with weakly written characters, badly directed scenes, horrendous production quality, abysmal storywriting, squandered progression, and a tragic identity crisis, all it does is try to make you cry and weep for characters whom you shouldn’t give a damn about in the first place. If only the story was able to change its prioritizations just even a little bit, I think it would’ve fared a lot better off. Instead, we got one of the worst fantasy shows I’ve ever seen, and all because it didn’t know what it truly wanted to be.

    Spoilers ahead!<br />

So I have to say that this is a pretty unique anime in terms of the fact that it&#039;s so popular right now and rated high, because the beginning was quite strong. And I think that has to do with the innate nature of humans to want to evolve by seeking stimul. So the opening episode was great, it set up quite the adventure! And from there it was a slow spiral towards boredom.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the main character, Fushi, lacks almost any motivation. I just finished watching episode 13 where the new prison arc begins and he(it?) still feels like a very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408925">
        bland character. I guess you can attribute that to the fact that he doesn&#039;t know what his purpose in life is, which is fine, but he is so unethusiastic about almost anything or doesn&#039;t know what to do at all, that by episode 13 it&#039;s just starting to get stale and repetitive. <br />
<br />
The side characters also feel a bit shallow and there&#039;s just this forever lingering feeling of &quot;who&#039;s going to die next?&quot; because we know it will happen. It is constantly reinforced, for example with the middle break where the wall shows the souls that Fushi consumed (or whatever happens). So it&#039;s just not worth getting interested in any character, because they will die and who cares, it&#039;s all for the purpose of making Fushi something that we have no idea what is suppose to be. <br />
<br />
Which brings us to the Nokkers which are also just...boring? They also don&#039;t seem to have a motive by this point except for destroying Fushi. So if he weren&#039;t there, would they appear? Maybe there&#039;s more to it, but the show feels so stale. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s interesting that for 12 episodes I didn&#039;t know if this show was good or not. And I feel like that&#039;s what a lot of people have. But in a way, if you can&#039;t tell a show will be good from the first few episodes, I think it&#039;s safe to say that it probably won&#039;t be for the rest of it. I know some shows have a nice turn after some time, but the amount of care I have left for this world is minimal. That is to say, I don&#039;t even know what this world is. We travel it with minimal information. And it&#039;s not really too exciting when you get to a new place. <br />
<br />
I am a bit sorry I am writing such a negative review, but it&#039;s honestly for my sanity the ones that are also wonderting if this show is a &quot;masterpiece&quot; or just a show that had some kind of a good idea, but just failed to execute it better. But hey, there&#039;s potential to be found in it for something else, if it gripped so many people from the start.

    To Your Eternity is not a great anime, nor is it necessarily a bad one. It’s stuck at an awkward in between, with interesting themes and a refreshing story being weighed down by clumsy and often boring writing. The blend of adventure and drama sets it apart from other anime like it, and as disappointing as some moments in the series can be you can understand why many people will find them emotional.<br />
<br />
There are three main arcs throughout the 20 episodes, four if you count the first episode. Each one offers a new cast with new experiences for our immortal main character, Fushi. On their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414867">
        own the arcs aren’t bad, however after watching them back-to-back you will simply stop caring. The fact that the cast is always changing means you won’t be with any long enough to care about what happens, and the ones you do find yourself caring about are quickly forgotten as a new cast and setting is shoved in your face. Any sense of emotion or excitement offered by the first episode loses its touch almost instantly. You already know that something bad is going to happen everywhere Fushi goes, and it becomes a matter of when the bad thing happens rather than what will happen. Now this predictability on its own isn’t a bad thing. If it is backed up by interesting and planned out characters, it won’t matter how unoriginal the actual scenarios are. The thing is though, every single character throughout the show is flat, bland, and honestly just plain boring to watch. It’s like the writer imagined one specific sad scenario in their head and ran away with it, forgetting the very basics of what makes a story interesting and engaging. It takes multiple episodes to get to an overall underwhelming outcome, and this repeats itself for three whole arcs. I’ll repeat myself here, at some point in the series you will simply stop caring.<br />
<br />
One thing I can give it credit for is how the growth of Fushi is shown. It honestly feels like with each new episode and event Fushi grows in some way, and these additions to his character will impact how he acts and speaks onwards. It never feels like he hits a wall with character development, and it is much more interesting watching Fushi grow than a typical melodrama character. There is obvious planning and care behind his character, and you can see it greatly pay off in the long run.<br />
<br />
Now onto what I would consider the worst part of the whole series, the “antagonist,” though I would probably describe as more of a mindless opposing force. It is introduced as a mysterious entity that interrupts Fushi’s adventures and forces him to grow stronger. Great right? Now there is something to move the plot along provide areas for character growth. Except that that’s all there is to it. Every time this mysterious opposing force appeared I wanted to groan. There is obviously something more to it, this is made obvious early into the series. Don’t expect find out what though, the show is too busy dabbling with other ideas to expand on it at all during the 20 episodes. Thankfully, there is a human antagonist with a bit more personality and depth. They’re still messily written but for what it’s worth the episodes that they appeared in were some of the most engaging for me. If it wasn’t for their awkward placement in and out of certain arcs, they probably would’ve been the highlight of the series.<br />
<br />
I tend not to worry about art or sound too much, but I think Brains Base did a solid job with both and I have no major issues. That said, there are no real times where either of these will stand out and leave a lasting impression. The visuals and audio are just consistently good throughout all 20 episodes.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think To Your Eternity does a good job at experimenting with and expressing its themes and ideas, especially surrounding mortality and what it means to be human. If it wasn’t for the repetitive and disconnected plot as well as the poor character writing this series could have easily been around an 8/10. I would recommend at least giving the anime a try, though be prepared for the plot to become predictable and repetitive straight from the very first episode.<br />

    A foreword for this extensively long review: this review will have some spoilers, and I&#039;ve tried my best to keep it vague as best as possible not to sway off all who read this and wanting to try the anime for yourselves. You have been warned.<br />

&quot;At first, it was an orb. Not just any typical orb. It could change itself by imitating the form of all that may and does exist. I decided to throw the orb upon this land to observe the various mutational forms of this immortal to see how it tries to adapt to the environment around it. There is but one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414864">
        enemy I&#039;m worried of, and it&#039;s these shape-shifting monsters called the Nokkers who appear to grasp more intelligence than the Orb. This is my account of the journey with the Orb.&quot; - The Beholder, voiced by Kenjirou Tsuda<br />

“The limits of my language mean the limits of my world. Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent. The world is everything that is the case. The world is the totality of facts, not of things.” - Ludwig Wittgenstein<br />
<br />
What makes a human, truly human? This is always the question that always rings in our minds when we encounter a self-heart talk realization. Is it compassion, empathy, logic, our consciousness? Empiricist David Hume believes that all human ideas have roots from sense impressions. Meaning, even if we imagine a creature that does not exist, your imagination of it still consists of things you’ve sensed in the real world. This is in part of using different mental processes that are fundamentally part of being human: Resemblance, Contiguity in time or place, and Cause and Effect. It&#039;s our own perception of truth, that each of us, no matter how different, exists. When humans seek truth, they come into moments of realization. Small moments of realization lead to a sense of happiness of fulfillment. Big moments of realization, on the other hand, are truly what makes us human. It is when we experience these crucial consciousness-altering experiences, that we can finally say, with certainty, what it means to be human. And this is certainly the case for &quot;Fumetsu no Anata e&quot; a.k.a &quot;To Your Eternity&quot;.<br />
<br />
To say that the adaptation of the now-renouned &quot;Koe no Katachi&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;A Silent Voice&quot;) author Yoshitoki Ōima&#039;s next big thing is a masterclass of a work, is a gross understatement. There is some truth and not to that, that puts it shy of a modern great anime in the making. And watching this &quot;pulling heartstrings&quot; worth of some powerful gut-wrenching writing, Yoshitoki Ōima sure knows how to concoct a well-thoughtout story with great well-endowed illustrations that are brought to life in a substantial way from Baby Steps director Masahiko Murata and the production team over at Brain&#039;s Base to adapt this unusual full 25-minute (including OP, ED and next episode previews), 20-episode run covering the first 6 volumes (totaling 54 chapters) of the manga on nowhere else other than NHK Educational TV (because that&#039;s a channel catered specifically to the kids, and it serves as a learning lesson just like most programs there). You need not a big Brain, but a good foundational Base to understand this deep rabbit hole of a &quot;feelings&quot; show. And somehow...also inputting the Baby Steps that&#039;s similar to a newborn child birthed and graced onto Earth in an utmost sentimental way possible. See? No pun intended.<br />
<br />
Some background info out of the way: Following the insane success of &quot;Koe no Katachi&quot;, to which &quot;Fumetsu no Anata e&quot; is a complete 180 tonal shift on that, this is the story that&#039;s dedicated to the loving memory of Yoshitoki Ōima&#039;s deceased ailing and sick grandmother, taken as an influence to one of the characters in this story. You have to remember that coming off from &quot;A Silent Voice&quot; (which is largely a story of characters who are confronting their past), with &quot;To Your Eternity&quot;, Yoshitoki Ōima herself penned a fantasy story, one that is devoid of its freedom while capturing the supernatural part of beings being immortal so as to give them a recourse throughout its learning journey to focus on the future, what lies ahead for the characters going forward. A little unknown fact is that Yoshitoki Ōima&#039;s first outing into the manga industry is creating the illustation art for Tow Ubukata&#039;s Mardock Scramble, and this serves as a tie-in to an exploration with the poignant themes of death. Also, did you know that Fushi (the Orb) was never meant to be male? That&#039;s because the author herself drew Fushi when she was young, the design had stuck ever since before everything began, and when it came time to deciding on Fushi&#039;s character, Yoshitoki leans on her preference for having neutral protagonists and natural female characters, coupling the suggestion of a male protagonist for a different appeal into the mix.<br />
<br />
As for the overall setting, it&#039;s literally just that: the protagonist Fushi, or the Orb that &quot;knows nothing&quot;, being sent onto the Earth to figure out what to do in such a blank state of mind. One thing that Fumetsu doesn&#039;t shake away is the themes of death and immortality that&#039;s portrayed in the manga. And towards the anime adaptation, it has done the perfect translation onto the small screen, bringing with it the abject emotions like when you&#039;re reading the manga for the very first time. The snowy landscape that&#039;s seen in the very beginning is why Yoshitoki Ōima has chosen to reinforce the blank state themes to create a white universe, a permanment reminder that &quot;everything is as white as snow, but not as clear cut when outside of its comfort zone&quot;. And that comes in part of Yoshitoki Ōima herself, having to watch similar documentaries like it to capture the notion of a single being, that&#039;s practically being left out in the world to survive with limited resources and skills under very difficult and intense circumstances. And we see that reflected in the anime, where the immortal Fushi strives to take on different forms, slowly learning about the beings it transforms into and their abilities in supposed forms to learn to adapt to whatever the situation calls for. In both high and low, good and bad moments, not forgetting about its own humanity that&#039;s bred overtime, learnt from the direct guidance from The Beholder confrontation with mysterious shape-shifting beings called the Nokkers which increase its intelligence levels with every preceding battle with the immortal.<br />
<br />
The characters in Fumetsu are actually based off of real-life personalities. Fushi itself (because his origin is &quot;the Orb&quot; first and foremost) is based on one word: Survival. Therefore, to integrate the Orb into the story, Yoshitoki Ōima had to think of practical reasons that would subject it to difficult circumstances, and the decision was made to have 3 elements affect the immortal: climate, disease and Man&#039;s natural carnivorous animal enemy, the polar bear. These 3 elements serve as the obstacles to the human will, and Yoshitoki Ōima&#039;s reasoning is to further elaborate that people living in the wild have to live with and show the process of overcoming these inevitable challenges. Also, notice that I did mention that Fumetsu&#039;s story is dedicated to the author&#039;s deceased grandmother, she is the inspiration for the basis of Grandma Pioran&#039;s character, and having to juggle with inevitable death is a guilt trip all by itself. Every volume of the manga features a story where that person makes a significant change in Fushi&#039;s life, and in the anime we get 6 of them in this pairing: The nameless boy and his dog Johan; March and Parona of Ninnanah; the Takunaha arc of Gugu and Rean; Hayase of Yanome; and the Jananda arc of Tonari. A fun fact that in the complete manga package, Yoshitoki Ōima&#039;s story would see Fushi meet approximately 13 people to intersperse his life with them, so much so that this story had a different working title as &quot;Ash Swords of 13 People&quot;. Kinda begs the thought that this title would sound too hard to be pronounced or related, so I&#039;m kinda glad the title was changed for speakeasy reasons. Out of all the characters that the author herself liked to draw, March is the favourite due to her short stature, and that she likes drawing children simulated in confined places (you can see that aesthetic in the anime a lot). The feels are real.<br />
<br />
Brain&#039;s Base&#039;s production translation onto the small screen is somewhat of an odd ball by itself. Being close to a 2-cour (23/24 episode) run, you certainly can&#039;t expect that the production will hold up with its glistening factors of consistency. To shed more of what Fumetsu tries to illustrate with its many overlaying and underlying themes of juxtaposition between regular human beings&#039; communion and death incarnate that&#039;s true to Yoshitoki Ōima&#039;s writing style, that&#039;s supported with her lushly drawn panels in the manga, it&#039;s a no-brainer that it&#039;s certainly asking a lot for to keep production at a steady and consistent pace to reflect the manga as well as it should. And despite the low-quality visuals that go hand-in-hand with shows that have a 2-cour run, I&#039;d say that Fumetsu still arguably looks better than most recent 2-cour shows I&#039;ve seen (barring the obvious Shounen ones obviously), and it&#039;s just as preposessing and fanciable going hand-in-hand alongside the incredible story of feels. Not the best of Brain&#039;s Base shows I&#039;ve seen in recent times (in regards to 2020&#039;s Kyokou Suiri a.k.a In/Spectre), but it&#039;s serviceable enough.<br />
<br />
The music in Fumetsu...really is in a whole other ball park. Let&#039;s kick off with the OP and ED, because I feel that this NEEDS to be mentioned. You should know who Hikaru Utada is: even I&#039;ll admit that while the recent Evangelion movie (3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time) didn&#039;t exactly set the world on fire to bring Hideaki Anno&#039;s legendary franchise to a resounding close, her ED &quot;One Last Kiss&quot; is where it&#039;s at that did just that. And adding to her music composition of a catalogue is yet another song, titled &quot;Pink Blood&quot; for the OP. While the song is still largely pretty good (though IMO &quot;One Last Kiss&quot; is still the better song and the ultimatum gold standard), I have to preface that if you&#039;re just starting out to watch Fumetsu, DO NOT WATCH the OP as it is 100% COMPLETE spoiler overload for anime-onlies about the show&#039;s entirety, and being a manga reader, I can attest to the fact. On the ED side, you may not know who Masashi Hamauzu is, but other than the instrumental ED &quot;Mediator&quot; being  yet another amaze-balls, his talent being that of being hired in Square Enix by the legendary Nobuo Uematsu to work on some games (e.g. FF7, FF13 and SaGa Frontier 2 to name a few) and then succeeding him as lead composer when Nobuo Uematsu left in 2004, this guy has some rich music composition of an astounding career that&#039;s not just limited to Final Fantasy OSTs. <br />
<br />
Both sound and music directors Takeshi Takadera and Ryou Kawasaki have ostensibly different track records on the shows they&#039;ve done credited to their name, but there is one thing that you most certainly CANNOT mistake their talents for: quality. The former having worked on shows like Cross Game and Yowamushi Pedal, and the latter being the prominent figure on Shoukoku no Altair and the more recent Fate/Grand Order: Babylonia, and you can feel the union between directors who know their craft well and delivered full-time on the show itself. The OST in Fumetsu just takes your breath away being a beautiful, mesmerizing, yet solid work all throughout as you watch the show, and not once did any insert track feel misplaced, but added to the overt expressions of the anime to its full degree. Seriously though, focusing on Ryou Kawasaki, this man doesn&#039;t get enough credit for his outstanding work in Fumetsu, and the anime&#039;s music department is a rock-solid stellar masterpiece of work.<br />
<br />
Love it or hate it, &quot;Fumetsu no Anata e&quot; a.k.a &quot;To Your Eternity&quot;, to the Average Joe, depending on who you ask, can be an easy 2021 masterpiece AOTY or an egregiously overrated and over-hyped series. And I acknowledge both sides of the coin to the fact that as good as the anime adaptation can be, the manga is still leaps beyond the anime in terms of the same heart-wrenching feelings and emotions that just has no words being that great of a standalone source material. Nonetheless, Fumetsu is a series that I won&#039;t beckon you to &quot;go watch immediately because it&#039;s just that good&quot; for a recommendation, but you only need two things to be prepared (or not) to binge this all the way through: a steel-cold heart and a stacked tissue box, because this show will break your heart in tears for as many times as it could nilly-willy. And contrasting to &quot;Koe no Katachi&quot; a.k.a &quot;A Silent Voice&quot;, Fumetsu will not remain silent with a voice of help, but it&#039;ll call you with the voices of methodical humanity that&#039;ll leave you wanting for more. What a wild rollercoaster of a ride that this show has become, and I would not have wanted it in any other way possible.

    It is fundamental to express emotions in order to make a work of fiction great – that’s something the anime industry knows very well. Sad and depressing emotions are frequently seen in anime works, but the real key to success is to combine them with pleasant and hopeful emotions. Thrill, suspense, compassion, excitement and enjoyment; all of them are important to form a good show. Fumetsu no Anata e has its unique style, which most people like – considering its global appeal and popularity - and others do not. But this style is what really prevents it from standing close to “top tier” anime, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415259">
        that is a fact.<br />
<br />
Fumetsu no Anata e started off with an amazing opening episode; full of emotions, beautiful character interactions and plot twists. It felt romantic and succeeded in piquing the watchers’ interest. This episode was the prologue arc, and then a chain of longer character arcs followed. What went so wrong that made this anime’s content controversial? That’s definitely the repetitive use of the pattern Ooida Yoshitoki used in every character arc. And after giving it some thought, I reached the conclusion that this pattern I’m talking about might work in a novel, but not in a TV show. So it is not necessarily the writer’s fault.<br />
<br />
The pattern promoted mostly depressing emotions and failed to emit the ones I mentioned before. As the series moved on, everyone was able to make a successful guess on how the story would proceed, which led to the loss of enthusiasm, thrill and enjoyment. The protagonist’s character development made sense, but in the end, that was all that happened in these twenty episodes. What only mattered was how strong (mentally and physically) Fushi would become, after a row of unpleasant and heartbreaking events.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, a character alone cannot make a top tier work of fiction. When it comes to the world build up, what is understood is that it concerns Fushi and only himself. People live in an underdeveloped society, but the mystery revolves around the supernatural element of the series; which is something he has to solve alone. The main villains’ character and motives (Nokkers) are not exactly shown yet, but it seems they are simple and exist to end our protagonist’s journey. As for Kansatsusha, it is not yet known if there are other creatures like him or why he behaves the way he does.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack of this anime is mostly atmospheric (“Emotional Suite”, “Pink Blood”, “Mediator”). It is not something special, but it fits well the atmosphere. The animation looks nice and fits the atmosphere as well. The prevailing colours are purple, brown and green. The voice acting is sometimes good and sometimes bad. Tsuda Kenjirou’s narrating is great.<br />
<br />
To conclude, Fumetsu no Anata e is a fantasy/supernatural anime whose main purpose seems to be to indicate how people can become stronger by facing hardships and moving on with their lives. To convey this message, it uses many short arcs which include a lot of tragic events and sad human emotions. It also shows human behaviour under difficult circumstances, people’s hope, people’s narrow-mindedness and other characteristics you may find out by watching.<br />
<br />
My personal advice is to not expect much even if you love the first episodes. Because I loved them as well, but my final score was 3/10.<br />
Thank you for reading!

Rating: 6/7 <br />
<br />
I know the series is not over yet, but the way it is going now I will have to give it somewhere between a 6 or a 7.<br />
<br />
I had high expectations with the first 3-4 episodes of the anime and was excited with the initial premise, but as with many other anime these days , it has kind of fallen flat as the series has progressed.<br />
<br />
The mystery of the main character to start off with was very intriguing but the more that becomes revealed, the less and less interested I become.<br />
<br />
The main villain of the story so far is still shrouded in mystery

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405219">
        but there is not much that drives me to care about it. The main character really has no desire or drive for anything and it makes becoming attached to &quot;it&quot; very difficult. Aside from that, the  small amount of time spent with the side characters that are introduced and their lack of overall development really makes it hard to care for them or their absence from the story in anyway.<br />
<br />
As for the art and animation, it too has really taken a dive over time. I&#039;m not sure whether it was a budget issue or not, but there has been a definite quality drop from the first few episodes to the  current episode and while it is not horrible in any way, it just makes it that less exciting to watch.<br />
<br />
I do hope it gets better as the series goes on ,but with 8 episodes remaining, I&#039;m a little worried about how the pacing will turn out. <br />
<br />
All in all, I think this is a decent anime to save for a rainy day when you have run out of great ones to watch, but not anything truly special.

Laughter, sadness, pain, anger, fear, and hatred. These are all the emotions that a typical human being should know to make someone truly humane. At first, a human is born in the form of a baby, crying is the first form of emotion they experience. Then later they experience all sorts of different emotions. To your eternity is exactly that except, the protagonist we&#039;ll be following is actually an orb. That&#039;s right, it&#039;s an &quot;it&#039;. That is, it doesn&#039;t experience any form of emotion but it does stimulates

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415427">
        them to experience all sorts of different things an emotions. <br />
<br />
To your eternity is a beautiful experience. One that you haven&#039;t experienced this type of enjoyment from any other anime. It starts off with the maker sending an orb to the Earth to preserve resources. <br />
<br />
The orb first takes the form of non living things. Then a wolf passes by who is at death&#039;s door and &quot;it&quot; takes the form of the wolf. Yes, that&#039;s the first living being he has taken the form of. Babies in real life, first experience the emotion of &quot;crying&quot; but that&#039;s not the case for the orb. The first emotion he experienced was &quot;pain&quot; which he later overcomes it. <br />
<br />
[Spoilers]<br />
People refer to the first episode as the &quot;Nameless boy&quot; arc but it isn&#039;t because he doesn&#039;t have a name, it&#039;s just that there was no one out there to call out his name.The nameless boy&#039;s optimistic whom we first meet is so unreal that it&#039;s sad. He knows that his family is dead that is why he has drawn all the images of his family&#039;s faces on his wall or there would be no reason to. He knew he and his best friend Joan(the wolf) would die too that&#039;s why he also drew both of their faces. The boy basically went to an early suicide the moment he set foot to go to the so called &quot;Paradise&quot; but the thing is, outside of his Island, there is no such thing as &quot;Paradise&quot; which you&#039;ll see later why. He wants to meet new places and nice people but the boy is just being delusional because what&#039;s out there is just a cruel world. The part where he said &quot;Remember me&quot; gave me literal goosebumps and that was a powerful scene. The nameless boy then dies and the wolf then takes the form of the boy. <br />
<br />
People will say it isn&#039;t right to take the form of the dead but I say that if he takes the form of the boy, he&#039;ll carry on the wish the boy had and that is, to meet new places and learn different things. Some may also say that the nameless boy deserved to know that Joan died but I say it is a small mercy bestowed upon him when all the suffering he has been through.<br />
<br />
[No spoilers]<br />
It then meets March who just wants to be a grown up. This is kind of like a first world wish at first glance compared to the nameless boy but then again, she is just a child who is innocent<br />
<br />
I love the realism that is showed in this series. It shows that the author isn&#039;t afraid to show  dark themes it has. This series gives you a gist of realism that the society was back in the past which I&#039;m amazed because this is the think that today&#039;s battle shounen seem to lack of. <br />
<br />
Gugu&#039;s arc is literally beautiful. His brother is a scumbag who leaves him in a middle of a crisis. He meets a girl whom he is in love with. Both wishes what each other wants. So you can say both of their wishes are connected in a certain way which makes this arc even more beautiful. You may find Reen super annoying but you&#039;ll most likely grow on her by the end.<br />
<br />
The Soundtrack in this Anime is phenomenal. I get goosebumps everytime I listen to it. It feels like, the music is describing Fushi&#039;s entire journey. Literally the most unique soundtracks I&#039;ve heard.<br />
<br />
However, every show has it&#039;s faults and To your eternity is not an exception in this one.<br />
<br />
The problem by which the show suffers from is the places where Fushi visits isn&#039;t connected by anyway. In other words, the arcs are disjointed, thereby not leading to an overarching grand finale. Even Assassination Classroom didn&#039;t had any overarching arc like To your eternity but at least it led to an overall grand finale but To your eternity is making it seem like, the story isn&#039;t going anywhere. Sometimes, an arc is episodic, sometimes an arc is like 4 episodes, sometimes an arc is about 12 episodes long. It doesn&#039;t know what it&#039;s trying to be.<br />
<br />
Another problem where it suffers from is that, it&#039;s repetitive.<br />
<br />
The only way Fushi develops is if someone dies and he uses those characters as a tool for him to survive. This is a huge pet peeve of mine if the author uses character death&#039;s as the only way for character development. In my opinion, that&#039;s called poor writing. Sometimes, I feel like the author is playing with our feelings it&#039;s like she doesn&#039;t care about our feelings at all.<br />
<br />
The deaths in Jananda Island also felt meaningless and forced. There was literally no need for the characters to die as they contributed nothing to the plot. Maybe it will make Tonari independent but the end of that arc literally showed that the villagers will continue to support her so she&#039;s not all alone.<br />
<br />
Even with it&#039;s faults, that does not make me to not like To your eternity. In fact, it was one of the most memorable and quite unique Anime I&#039;ve ever watched. Fushi learns what it means to be a grown up when met March, he learned what it&#039;s like to have a family when he met Gugu and he learned what it&#039;s like to have friends when he met Tonari. He&#039;ll surely learn all kinds of emotions as the story progresses, but he&#039;ll never learn &quot;something&quot; which will make him truly human and that &quot;something&quot; is called Death

    This show with just watching the first episode is able to show this will truly be something special.<br />
<br />
story:<br />
I can say this show is giving me the same feeling Dororo did but even still it&#039;s pretty different and I really am enjoying what is being presented so far. We are taken on a journey with this orb who is emotionless, and takes on the form of different things, over time it becomes a wolf and becomes acquaintances with a boy. You can see the attachment grow after they spend time together and you get to learn what the boy desires most. After a while the boy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398124">
        dies and the orb takes the form of him. Now it is on a journey to fulfill the desires of the boy he spent time with, to be able to experience new things, new people and new emotions. <br />
<br />
I really like this premise, I think it’s captivating and I can already tell this show will continue to be filled with deep meanings, heartbreaking/heartwarming moments and will make us cry, because I can say I already have.<br />
<br />
The art <br />
the style is really pretty, there&#039;s no complaints here <br />
<br />
The sound <br />
it also well done too, I enjoy the op and ending as well as the ost’s which are captivating and are beautiful, they fit with the scenes very well.<br />
<br />
characters<br />
I’m really enjoying the development with the characters so far, Fushi is an interesting character and being able to see him grow and get attached to the others is touching to watch. The show makes you, at least for me, attached to the characters even in a short amount of time. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
 I gave a 10/10 and I don&#039;t think it will change, I have high expectations. I feel it brings a really strong and emotional atmosphere to it. Again I truly think this show is something special, definitely something that will pull on your heartstrings and after every end of an episode it leaves you wanting more! I couldn’t recommend enough!!!<br />
<br />
thank you for reading <br />
<br />

    SPOILER-FREE ANIME REVIEW<br />
<br />
<br />
Yoshitoki-san&#039;s recent Manga, Fumetsu no Anata e is by far one of the &quot;Anime of The Year&quot; candidates for me, along with Mushoku Tensei. Though it hasn&#039;t got much popularity as the other animes this year. It provides a good supernatural story that&#039;s sure will become more interesting as the show continues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
As the title says 「不滅」, It&#039;s about an Immortal being in a form of an orb-like thing that&#039;s unknown aside that it can take the shape of something. A creature without an instinct nor personality. It landed on a stone and take its form as an actual copy. As time passes by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414911">
        it takes a form of a wolf that&#039;s been wounded after it died suffering in a harsh blizzard. The unknown being gained its instinct as an animal. To live, according to what your body needs. It was then discovered by a Boy from a nearby village and decided to take the being and been named &quot;Joan&quot;. He followed the boy throughout his exploration of finding his co-villagers. The nameless boy got an injury from their expedition and has nothing like medicine to cure his wound. Joan&#039;s just observing him as he&#039;s currently on the edge of his life. After the boy passed away, The wolf took over its form as a Human. However, being a human doesn&#039;t mean he&#039;s already like one. The thing is still the same as it is in a form of a wolf, aside from that it can stand by its feet. As the story progress, he learns how to act like and become a human, that can talk, decide for his own, has the emotions, feelings and it&#039;s own personality.<br />
<br />
Side Note: Pretty much after the first episode, I think the show went downhill. Maybe because others especially the anime-only watchers think it has more to offer of the tragic events seen in the first episode. It&#039;s still an amazing show with its unique story and shows the side of drama in the supernatural genre as the protagonist learns about living as a human.<br />

Art/Animation:<br />
Brain&#039;s Base is the studio responsible for this adaptation. They&#039;re famous for other franchises like  Durarara! , Baccano! and My Teen Romcom SNAFU 1st season adaptations. And I can say they did a pretty great job on this show. They made it more into the side of drama thing to capture the emotions in this show. They&#039;ve improved a lot and adapted the material with good overall animation. The Colors are stunning and show a nice tone for the scenes.<br />
<br />
Rating: 8<br />

<br />
Sound/Voice Acting:<br />
Audio production in this show is Awesome. The music perfectly fits in every scene it is played. Whether it&#039;s a fight/thrilling scene or the Dramatic tune of the story. The Sound Effects are also great.<br />
Personally, I love Tsuda Kenjiro&#039;s role as the Observer or Fushi&#039;s creator. His narration of the story is so satisfying as expected from his low-tone voice. Gotta give some appreciation as well to the soundtracks here like the OP and ED<br />
<br />
Side Note: The Opening song by Hikaru Otada &quot;Pink  Blood&quot; is Perfect for the Anime. Although it is great, I wouldn&#039;t recommend seeing the OP clip as it shows many spoilers throughout the show. But if you don&#039;t mind seeing those and appreciate the beauty of the music, Just enjoy listening to it every time. <br />

Characters:<br />
Aside from the Protagonist named Joan and later becomes &quot;Fushi&quot;, The side characters from different areas are really interesting and well written. March reminds me of Dororo in the show with the same name. She&#039;s a child tribe girl with a good mother-side and always full of positivity. Parona, an acting big sister to March who always wants to protect everyone she loves and cares about. Pioran, an old lady who&#039;s a criminal when introduced and sooner after being with the short time with Fushi she thinks that living her life right now that she has a shorter time to live would give her satisfaction. Gugu, a young boy who&#039;s already been working despite being a child to provide their daily needs with his brother but ended up being his face got smashed after involvement in an accident and after surviving the fatality he&#039;s now forced to wear a helm to hide his scary-looking face. And Tonari, a resident of Jananda that helps Fushi to rescue Pioran from the ones who deceived them. All have been pretty impactful on Fushi&#039;s character development through the Story. They&#039;re all helpful and become a very important part of Fushi&#039;s life.<br />
<br />
Rating: 9<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I&#039;m pretty much sure that I love this show. It&#039;s on my candidates for the Anime of the Year as I&#039;ve said. The first episode caught me off guard and immediately went to the manga just after seeing it. It is a very great show nowadays that mostly doesn&#039;t focus on things without comedy, school life or romance in it. I&#039;m thankful to the staff especially the Author Miss Yoshitoki for Introducing her to another work after giving us the intense psychological impact on Koe no Katachi. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
