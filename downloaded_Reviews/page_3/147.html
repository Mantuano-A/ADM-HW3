    Watching Welcome to the Ballroom throughout its six month long, two cour run was one of the most disheartening experiences I’ve yet to endure in all of my years. I watched with dreadful attention as the industry titan, Production IG themselves, those who’ve defined high-quality TV animation even after relegating their most legendary among an already packed house of unrivaled talent into the realm of exclusively theatrical productions, as they brought to air a shounen manga adaptation in much the same vein as their previous successes with the genre, Haikyuu and Kuroko no Basuke, only now with the same CG extras and panning over stills

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304381">
        which plague any other garbage studio as opposed to the ceaseless sakuga and lavish key animation which we’ve all come to know them for—and only them for. No matter how handsome, no matter how sharp the male designs; no matter how sexy, no matter how shapely the female designs; no matter how lively the color palette popped and setting design shined; no matter how elegant the soundscape nor how powerful the dialogue, the show as a whole simply could not contend with the gripping, inspiring, elating aura its predecessors captured their deservedly massive audiences with whilst being stained by such—not even poor—just lacking animation. Now, call me a wishful thinker, but they’re back. Production IG’s TV Animation Team is back in a big way with Run with the Wind.<br />
<br />
Run with the Wind boasts such a splendidly rich animation production, it really reminds you just how impressive, how downright humbling this division of the studio is at its best of times. The character designs are as clean, sharp, and all-around attractive as those of Haikyuu and Welcome to the Ballroom, fit with a level of orate detail which was incessantly impressive to see in such fluid movement. The design-work of the main cast in particular, as well as the voice actors chosen to play them, clearly had a lot of thought put behind them, as you can see exactly why they dress the way they dress, walk the way they walk, accessorize the way they accessorize, and how such distinct appearances representing such well-realized personalities can really benefit the immersion of the work as a whole. And as the show progresses and you come to understand the characters more intimately, you’ll slowly start noticing more and more of those little details that had been there the entire time. It’s as brilliant as it is beautiful, and the background art never slacks either, as expected of the committed craftsmen and women of IG who would never sacrifice one facet of production on behalf of another’s quality—they just make it ALL that good. The astounding level of hand-drawn details, expertly mixed manual and digital shading, color variation and gradients, and well-researched setting references all work in tandem to build this gorgeous aesthetic of naturalistic beauty balanced with realistic subtlety.<br />
<br />
On top of the impeccable visuals, the sound design is so nuanced and ever-present, when I noticed it I would become so absorbed and distracted as to miss entire lines of dialogue and have to rewind. And I can say without hesitation the soundtrack is an easy nine out of ten, as the composer was the same talent behind the monumentally epic, blood pumping score for Haikyuu, the emotionally gripping yet hyper-stylized Studio Trigger tracklist for Kiznaiver, and the music for Death Parade, which reached the heights of contemplative character dramaturgy and exciting psychological thrillers both. I simply cannot praise the production of Run with the Wind any more without it coming across as hyperbole, and as for the narrative which gave the beauty its heart and the solid writing which firmly held it all together, it was pretty damn good itself, even if not as breathtakingly perfect as the production values were. The main characters made up one of the most grounded ensemble casts in all of anime, easily competing with and outclassing legitimately good shows like Durarara, Hajime no Ippo, or Assassination Classroom, who’re all known for their ability to deftly juggle enormous casts whilst developing those within them. Unlike those aforementioned and most others which aren’t even half as good, Run with the Wind managed to not merely manage the large cast, but to actually mete out character development in a down-to-earth manner which didn’t challenge the realism of the story’s structure.<br />
<br />
At no point in this show is there anything that could be described as an “arc.” Never does the narrative take a break for drama, nor does it ever feel like one character in particular is being too overbearing or stealing the spotlight, with any necessary character building sneaking its way into the narrative subtly. Such sensible pacing works wonders for any conflict too, since all confrontations are built up to naturally. Nothing ever comes out of nowhere and is usually born from within the main character, Kakeru, who you get to know well enough to both sympathize and empathize with the anxieties of. While it’s not hard for me to image someone having a problem with the blunt spright-man bringing all the conflict to the table being the main character himself, his deep-seated motivations are so well-written and intrinsic to his character which we’ve come to understand, I totally got where he was coming from whenever he blew his top. That said, this brand of discord is by no means unique to Kakeru. All the characters have insecurities and hangups which feel truly genuine. Most anime will have characters ranting and raving about a bunch of out-of-this-world garbage the viewer has no reason to care about, but Run with the Wind does nothing of the sort. The character Nico-chan (a play on the word “nicotine”) has difficulty running for his addiction to smoking and his unhealthy BMI. The character King has trouble being committed to the team because he has to find work to pay for college. The character Shindo has doubts about his involvement with the team because his girlfriend dumped him after feeling he had neglected her. All the characters are real, with real scripts, with real problems. It’s a seriously wonderful cast who brings the relatively straightforward story to life, and there were a number of times I had tears in my eyes watching them cross the finish line.<br />
<br />
The final point I wanted to discuss before concluding is the villain, Sakaki. Sports anime, simply put, NEVER commit to real villains. They always pussyfoot around the issue with mutually understood competition wherein the opponents are never genuinely malicious and are only causing conflict for the sake of sportsmanship. The only time truly antagonist villains appear in sports anime is like Jabberwock from Kuroko no Basuke, or Bryan Hawk from Hajime no Ippo, or the Blue Mars from One Outs, or any other one-dimensional villains out there who are just evil assholes for the sake of being so. Out of all four thousand anime I’ve seen, I’ve yet to see a wholesale ill natured antagonists who truly wants to beat the protagonists solely out of hatred. Sakaki, the main villain in Run with the Wind, is the first character I’ve seen in a sports anime who truly earned the title of “villain.” His history with Kakeru makes for a heavy motivation for conflict, and his vindictive attitude comes across as being deserved, even if you take Kakeru’s side. Again, Kakeru may not always be righteous, so the idea he has some skeletons in his closet isn’t all that far fetched. As you learn more about their pasts, and you get both sides of the story, you’re naturally invested. It’s just another really, really good aspect of the show which I wanted to make a point wasn’t under-appreciated at all in my review since Run with the Wind is a fantastic show I highly recommend for what I hope are now obvious reasons, and that’s not even mentioning the fact this point is what begins to illuminate the refreshingly unexpected psychological core behind it all. As I’ve said no shortage of times, the main character Kakeru is a really flawed person. He’s impulsive, irritable, and outright violent, and it’s not even anyone’s fault, it’s just who he is. So, he runs. He literally and metaphorically runs away from his problems and is constantly accused of doing so by many characters in the show. As said problems continue to pile up despite his speed, he realizes the problems are within and running simply won’t escape them. When he finally stops and turns around to see all the people he’s hurt along the way, all the mistakes he’s made and regrets he has, and all the people still trying to support him in spite of all he’s done, he sits down and confronts reality in a poignantly human fashion, and it’s this emotional courage that frees his spirt, so to speak, so he can truly move forward and run with the wind.<br />

    Is it just me or does it seem like we don’t get enough literature anime adaptations these days? Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru (also known as Run With the Wind) is an actual book adaptation and features competitive running as part of its plot. Like most competitive sports, the show delivers storytelling to feature the journey of characters to accomplish their goals. Thankfully, this show delivers a promise that won’t leave you disappointed.<br />
<br />
To check off the bucket list, you should probably ask yourself if you enjoy a story driven by drama with sports elements. Because make no mistake, this anime contains a great deal of realism

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304369">
        while selling drama at every chance it gets. It will try to evoke emotions out of the viewers and between the storytelling, you’ll experience a story with its insightful character cast.<br />
<br />
Meet Kakeru Kurahara, the 1st year former elite runner at Kansei University. The first episode shows his daredevil actions as he is caught stealing. Thankfully, he is saved by 4th year student Haiji Kiyose who has an ambitious dream of competing in the Hakone Ekiden. The Hakone Ekiden is considered an important relay race taking place btween Tokyo and Hakone in Japan. Kakeru seems like a perfect candidate to be on the team. Upon being invited to the Kanse University Dorm, he quickly discovers it’s a place for the Track and Field team. The show sets up for huge amount of story and character development as we quickly realize how weak their team actually is.<br />
<br />
Now I’ll say right off the bat that I am a sucker for an underdog story. It has potential to develop characters on many levels. The problem here is that Kakeru isn’t a noob compared to the rest of the team. He already has experience in running but lacks the enthusiasm. This is explained through some very complicated and dark background storytelling. Apparently, an incident from his former Track &amp; Field team caused him to doubt himself. Nonetheless, I believe Kakeru’s personality to be one that people can understand after seeing what he’s been through. This is a sharp contrast to Haiji, who is always enthusiastic about the team and his dream. The main problem is that the team requires a lot of training and commitment to compete at the Hakone Ekiden level. Still, I appreciate the character bond of the team. As the show progresses, Kakeru begins to realize that he’s not running alone and that he has friends to run with. A main selling point about Kakeru’s own journey is how he conquers his personal demon and move beyond his past.<br />
<br />
You better get used to seeing a lot of Kakeru and Haiji’s character bonding in this story. Interestingly, the rest of the cast get their spotlights too as they reinforce the show’s themes. Characters such as Takashi and Akane (aka Prince) are inspirational for their dedication and realization to succeed. Remember, most of the guys in Haiji’s team aren’t experienced or very athletic. It takes a strong will, determination, and attitude to become succesful. The show carries character development as its team members strives to be the best they can be. It’s a relatable concept that can be applied to real life with goals being accomplished through hard work. I personally find the show’s attitude to be very inspirational with many of its character cast conquering their fears and running toward their dreams. <br />
<br />
As dramatic as the show can be, do also expect a decent amount of lighthearted moments and comedy. The Jo twins are a prime example of this with their playful personalities. The man service also adds in some cheek humor when the team have bonding moments while discussing about their goals. When the drama picks up though, definitely be prepare to experience the real deal. Teams such as the Rikudo University is no pushover for their reputation. Haiji’s push to get his team to succeed also comes at an immense amount of effort considering the requirements for this dream race. It’s revealed in the show that the team must rank into the top 10 teams and meet personal records. So by all means, it comes to no surprise the amount of pressure the team can feel while training. This is where the main amount of drama drops in with characters feeling how difficult is to reach their goals. Nonetheless, I confess to say that a show like this meets the satisfaction of “the journey is more important than the destination”. People may have hard this phrase many times before but as a driving force in the show, it suits for it perfectly. The amount of character development is expanded to most of the main character cast that you can easily recall their names and some of their memorable moments. No one is truly left out in favor of the main cast even as they seem featured more prominently at times. <br />
<br />
As a Production I.G. show, this definitely reminds me a bit of their other sports projects. Haikyu especially comes to mind for its similar character designs and competitive atmosphere. More importantly, I felt the great deal of realism for its character designs. Throughout the show, the characters evolve physically and mentally. Their character expressions and reactions carries an emotional weight that can easily be felt throughout the show. It’s the type of feeling when you finally earn a sense of pride and accomplishment after all the hard work. And don’t forget, the team is consisted of cool guys so the man service can be a treat for the ladies.<br />
<br />
With 23 episodes, I confess to say that it’s the perfect amount for this particular anime. Why? That’s because it managed to develop its character cast while staying consistent with the storytelling. The amount of realism made me realize how inspirational this show can be. With every episode, I felt compelled to see just how much the characters can succeed for their future. Honestly, we need more literature adaptations these days.

    Anyone who has ever run knows that it sucks. Why waterboarding is a thing when treadmills exist is a complete mystery to me. I guess even the KGB had its limit on how fucked up their torture methods were. Anyhoo, Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru --  Run with the Wind -- is a story about people who are literally the epitome of masochism and, as weird as it may sound, actually enjoy running. I was expecting a psychological series going in depth with this pain = pleasure thing, but turns out our series relies on fujobaiting instead.<br />
<br />
It should be warned already on the title page

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304371">
        that every factor from story progression, seiyuu choices, male casting and slice of life-like approach yells out one thing loud and clear: homo undertones. While great many sports series have chosen this approach (Haikyuu, Kuroko, Wind Up, Free -- just to name a few), Kaze ga has very little charm outside its naked ecchi boys / manservice factors. Just to specify to what extent this exist and why it is a problem: there are 4 scenes of our young boys being naked already shown in the first episode before we even know their names. I don&#039;t mind male ecchi or bros bathing together washing each others dicks when it is manly and #no_homo, but when it becomes the first thing that stands out in a sports series that was told be filled with drama and comedy, and executed with cute boys who don&#039;t, in any way, act like genuine humans, we are off to a terrible start.<br />
<br />
The selling point of sports series tends to be their cast for their stories can never truly work if the person(s) going thru the story are not worth of being followed. Kaze ga&#039;s cast and approach I&#039;d like to describe with a short meme: y Tho? Our &quot;club&quot; of 10 boys are, outside few expectations, the exact same people. They have nearly invisible personalities, all they have are things that are common between all of them for there aren&#039;t such things that would separate them from each others -- outside their outlooks. And even this isn&#039;t entirely true since there are even twins among them. As a whole, the cast is fake and empty to a point that I wonder if this is what feminists see when watching CGDCT or ecchi anime. The cast doesn&#039;t have much appeal to me. I couldn&#039;t find any way to care about any of them. They have nothing that would make relate to them, they offer no entertaining personality traits, their behavior is dull and mainly reminds me of cardboard. None of them have any interesting past stories or current stories. None of them even says anything mildly interesting at any point during the run. The more they talked the more I came to go meh over them. How awfully boring must ones life be to hang out with any of them? A question I found myself asking several times.<br />
<br />
Outside episode 16, the sports side is an absolute joke. Even tho I don&#039;t like running myself, I have seen series that focus on running and track&amp;field and which I have liked. Kaze ga&#039;s take on this torture method is exactly as dull as the sports itself. Nothing stands out, nothing feels meaningful, there aren&#039;t even any fitting/atmospheric or agro songs used that could make these scenes better. Instead, same few songs are repeated over and over and none of them is very fitting. So often, there plays some supposedly emotional song whilst our cast members run and sweat, followed, for example, by a scene where they get scolded for being too slow. What the series is trying to deliver here never reached my end. And typically, these running scenes are very short and made in the exact same manner, only thing that differs is the aftermath. Watching the execution here feels like repeatedly hitting ones head in the wall with a force so light that you barely even feel the effect, but still know it is happening. There are even sports series centering around baseball and fighting sports which field work (AKA running) is more noteworthy than anything Kaze ga achieved. The best characters here are these one-dimensional &#039;evil&#039; buttholes who just come around to mock our sports team for being a disgrace towards track&#039;n field. Why? Because their phrases are truthful remarks. Especially towards the end, the melodrama Kaze ga mixes together with sports is nothing less than a disgrace towards all athletes.<br />
<br />
In terms of actual story, one of the driving motions here are our boys interest to girls.. Literally &quot;lets run for the are girls.. on the other side of the road.&quot; I am not sure who the writer is trying to fool with this since they only introduce one slightly relevant female cast member and she is more obviously filler than any other character. Also, she falls under the trope &quot;every food she prepares turns poison&quot; because apparently it is funny when women can&#039;t cook. She is totally adorable regardless. Yet it feels so unnecessary to insert such things here yet not deal with them accordingly. The outcome is just idiotic. The events itself are rather formulaic. Male x male interactions in fujobait manner, bathing together naked, and running. Some pseudo-psychological things going on since, apparently, running (for our mc) is the same as running away from problems, and the main dude seems to have some. Even so, there is no clear reason for the series to exist, story-wise. It&#039;s clear from early on that the mc&#039;s &quot;insecurities&quot; are just bullshit used as an excuse to work as some sort of ongoing cliffhanger to make people interested in what type of &quot;mysterious&quot; reasons he has for being such an angsty loner. Other sides of the &quot;drama&quot; are practically sitcom-tier since the cast acts like a bunch of drama queens instead of there being any &quot;real&quot; drama going on. Sometimes randomly asspulled and beyond fake event occurs, such as one character suddenly losing a consciousness at the end of an episode just to create a cliffhanger worth of 3 pennies. To talk more about these cliffhangers, they are used to some extent and every time they match the definition of &quot;horse shit&quot;. False tension and not much more. <br />
<br />
The production, outside the incredibly bland character models (their bodies look like spaghetti and have even weirder necks than people in Ballroom e (not exaggerating -- same studio, also) -- and worth-of-nothing sports scenes, is one more thing that is not making this thing any better. The naked men bathing -scenes seem to be the ones that have gone thru the most planning. Comedy moments are over-simplified to a point that it looks just cheap and it is practically the exact same execution every single time. Dude&#039;s doing 2 frame shaking when being cornered. Otherwise the series screams it is made by Production I.G with their modern standards (which have been going down and down rather consistently for years if someone hasn&#039;t noticed). The pacing is simply too slow during any part that is not related to running and too fast with anything that is. Obviously, because they wanted to save money when animating running masses. CGI is being used during track events and it&#039;s like 3fps when out zoomed. Often, people who run look like they are floating over the track rather than touching the ground with their feet. Looks so incredibly lame. Not that it couldn&#039;t be forgiven if there were some actually good things going on. Pros that out weighted the cons. To me, even the smallest of problems stood out for I couldn&#039;t achieve any level of immersion with the series, rather saw it as nothing but a soulless product.<br />
<br />
All the criticism aside, I did quite enjoy moments around Akane &quot;Prince&quot; Kashiwazaki, who is the polar opposite of everyone else. Seems to hate running and is in really bad shape. His running form is so awkward and wrong that I managed to laugh at it few times, mainly reminding me of zombie movements from Resident Evil games. Even his posture while standing is advanced scoliosis, so I guess kudos for creating a dude like him. Other thing I have to drop here is the ending of episode 19 which was simply hilarious. If only there had been other good things I could praise than the rare few.

    This is surely the best anime of this season.<br />
<br />
Story:-9/10<br />
Looks like the anime industry has finally acknowledged the existence of a mythical place known as &#039;college&#039;. From the very first second you are drawn in due to the unique storyline.<br />
<br />
Art:-10/10<br />
The art style is so fluid that it easily sets this anime apart from others.Absolutely no inconsistencies/drop in quality anywhere.<br />
<br />
Characters:-10/10<br />
This is the USP of the show. We have 10 people,each studying in different majors and different years.Ample screentime is given to every character.Their interactions are highly realistic.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:-10/10<br />
This show is a perfect mixture of drama,motivation and comedy.There is never a dull moment.It feels difficult to wait an entire

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293592">
        week for a new episode.<br />
<br />
Sound:-9/10<br />
The opening is good, but the ending is just gold.Even in the sound department,nothing has been compromised.<br />
<br />
Highly recommended for everyone, even if you hate running.<br />

    This show is underrated and a true gem.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
<br />
Run with the Wind is a really special show, it’s been a long time since any story has quite impacted me this strongly. The story is actually quite simple, a bunch of college students decide to run a marathon, and their journey to reaching it. The execution is where the anime shines, there is never a wasted moment at all, every episode either focuses on the growth of a character, the growth of the team, or a major cliffhanger that leaves you wanting more. The anime outside of some unrealistic dramatic scenes, felt very relatable and refreshing,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304372">
        the college students felt mature, but not to mature, just the way people out of high school should feel. There weren’t to many stupid scenes involving walking into a bathroom that was unlocked or getting into a fight with some rival school or team like you would see in a show set in a middle school or high school. The setting was executed effectively, the jokes were solid, the pacing was consistent, and the story did not ignore anything that was very important. <br />
<br />
The last part is important because it allows the viewer to actually believe a team largely comprised of people who have never run competitively before could somehow actually qualify for the hardest college marathon in their country and perform well in it. The story focused on their training, on the amount of suffering they went through, on the support they had from their community and family, and most importantly on how each character overcame their obstacles one at a time instead of suddenly being a top tier runner.<br />
<br />
The story is a strong execution of a sports anime plot, it will keep you wanting more, it will make you feel excited for the team and their performance, and it will make you actually focus on all the subtle scenes that are thrown in and connected to the characters in the final race.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
<br />
The animation is smooth and clean, there were no major problems with it, the running choreography was some of the best I seen in anime, especially during the final race. Character designs did feel a bit basic, like the characters were just remodels of other shows done by Production IG, specifically Haikyuu. There is not much else to say, it was a good production, but nothing super amazing, it gets an 8 just for the angle and animation quality for the running scenes. <br />
<br />
The sound: 8<br />
<br />
The second opening was a very fun song especially the last 30 seconds. Overall the music suited the series and was designed to get the viewer hyped up for major scenes, worried during dramatic scenes, and focused during training scenes. The sound could have been better yes, there wasn’t any part of the OST I would listen to outside of watching the show, but for a sports anime this is good enough.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
<br />
At first, I thought the characters were just Haikyuu clones, with Kageyama as the main character, but I was totally wrong. The character development between the team started pretty slow however it was the right pace for a 24 episode show. The characters were funny, charming, interesting, well written, and extremely real, despite the very large cast by the end of the show you will know them all by name and know them as people. Although some of the characters did not get any real development until the very last episode outside of a few small scenes through the show, their final performance added up to so much more. <br />
<br />
We had a character quit his addiction to smoking and got to watch it slowly build up in the background until he could run, we got an otaku who couldn’t even jog run a marathon over time, we even a pair of twins each with very distinct personalities coming to terms with each other’s talents and how they should chase separate goals. This was easily the best part of the series, the characters were absolutely amazing, they had good chemistry, great inside jokes, and they even managed to bring an African character in and not have him be 1 dimensional fast runner because he is from Africa. <br />
<br />
The show also has a very strong MC who grew from a cold expressionless results-oriented person to someone who cared more about his team than his own performance. Overall the characters were simply the best part of the series and even if you don’t like sports anime, I would recommend watching this just for their growth in the series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
<br />
Being straight here, I never thought a show about running could be this exciting. I really enjoyed this series, it’s so far, the best sports anime I seen in the last year, and one of the strongest I ever seen. The characters, the drama, the growth, struggles, the successes, all of it resonates with me and anyone else who has ever attempted pursuing any competitive goal before. This is a much watch if you seen any other Production IG sports anime and wanted more.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
I give this show an 8, it was really hard deciding whether or not to give this show an 8 or 9 since it was very close, however I will give it an 8 for 2 reasons. One because although the main characters were great, the ending did not tie up all the loose ends for their development, I really wanted to know what happened to some of them given that one had injuries, one had a thing for a girl in the cast, and one that was graduating soon.I also wanted to know more about the future of their running club however that was left unclear and open ended. <br />
<br />
The second reason why I did not give this show a 9 was because the show required a bit much on unrealistic drama, for example a member is sick before the last race, another gets injured before the race, Kakeru’s argument with his rival also seemed really stupid and I can’t imagine anyone being angry for so long over something like that. But overall everything else was very good and this was one of my favorite recent shows, I still highly recommend it, and its definitely a high 8.<br />

    We, humans, are always an interesting bunch of creatures. The difference between us humans from animals is that we have dreams. Dreams we set as our goals with. We chase down our dreams in the road of life, hoping to reach self-satisfaction and eternal happiness. Sadly, not everybody has a solid resolve to chase down their dreams, while some don’t have an end goal in their life, making the destination of life confusing and frustrating. But even with those odds, we still continue to move and keep on running in different directions. We still chase down the unknown answer we seek. This is what Kaze

        ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru, better known as Run with the Wind, is about. This anime is not just an anime about track and field. But this anime also about our struggles in life, instead of walking forward, we decide to run-away aimless.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Short Synopsis)<br />
The show started off on one faithful night when Kakeru was being chased down by the convenient store for shop-lifting, this caught Haiji attention, after chasing down the culprit, Haiji realizes the potential of Kakeru in running, He then immediately offer Kakeru free residents in Chikusei-so apartment which Kakeru impulsively accepts. We are then introduced with 8 other college students residing in the apartment studying in the same university Kakeru’s attend to, which is Kansei University. After the welcome party of celebrating Kakeru’s residency as the 10th resident of Chikusei-so, Haiji later revealed that the apartment was formally the dormitory of the Kansei University Track Club. This further reveals his true intentions, the sole purpose of creating a 10 person track and field team to participate Hakone Ekiden, a prominent university marathon relay race in Japan, this explains why the apartment provided cheap rent and free food. Residents that sign the contract permitting them to live in Chikusei-so apartment are required to participate in the track and field club activities, or if they refuse, they immediately need to pack-up and leave. Unfortunately, the resident of the apartment cannot afford to move to another apartment so they have no choice but to participate in the club activities. This sparks the start of the main plot of the story. Honestly, the first few episodes are slow and boring for me. Around this duration, the plot focuses on introducing uninteresting and not so impressive batch of college students that has nothing special going for them. Frankly, in the first episode, it makes me believe that they have no chance of winning and they are too far away to reach their goal in reaching Hakone Ekiden.  For the reason, not all of them are willing to join and given that the majority of them are not even runners. It is kind of funny and interesting for me to see how this show will go on later episodes since this kind of joke will die out fast in a few episodes.<br />

(The Analysis)<br />
<br />
Plot &amp; Characters (9/10)&gt;&gt;&gt; 6.3pt<br />
Everything changes during the latter half of the series when some serious team exploration and internal conflicts take place. The narrative of the show drastically changes, from having an easy-going, light-hearted comedy narrative, about a lackluster team blindly aiming to the top. To a bona fide character-driven narrative that focuses on self-discovery, confrontation of one’s doubts and fear, and an inspiring drama story about mediocre individuals working together, to become something they never imagine they can ever be. This is the time where I got myself immerse and felt invested in Kansei University team efforts, as further I go to discover their struggles, and better know them as a person. As the series progresses, my entire viewpoint of the show changes for the better. I like what the show&#039;s narrative is aiming for. As the show continues to flesh-out its character you will discover that each character has a purpose. Their personality and life issues are relatable and easy to identify with. I admired the dedication of the show in representing each character, including the supporting cast, on how important they are in the team, each individual’s contribution matter and everyone is equal. Everybody is important and special on their own rights. This is another thing that impresses me in the show. It actually explains to us the importance of teamwork. It casually explains teamwork, even a person who doesn’t play a team base sport or play sport, in general, will easily understand the message the show is trying to convey. It promotes trust and faith to your fellow men. Life felt more meaningful when someone trusted you and give your life meaning. It always felt good when people rely on you and admire who you are. It is always reassuring that somebody got your back on critical times; this is how the entire Kansei University team felt over time, every time they run. Even though they were forced to run in the first place they gradually soon discover the hidden benefits and joy of the entire scheme. They realize that running gave them the opportunity that they never have the chance to experience before, and that is to live and spend your life with a purpose, without worrying or thinking too much. Even though the interpretation varies from each individual team member, the general message of living your life the fullest in the present is solid. Each individual character of the team has a solid development and resolution, it felt satisfying. I like how organic each character grow and mature towards the end. The show truly respected its character.  Starting from the not so interesting and mediocre individual, developing to highly inspiring and respectable figures, we can look up to. The show truly did a good job of handling its basic story and basic character direction to the fullest. In the end, the entire team runs with an open heart, no longer forced to run. They eventually succeeded in their goal to reach and be the top of Ekiden.  This makes the ending the show more impactful memorable as a whole. They didn’t just win the battle but they won the war! They open the path of a bright future that awaits them to chase down, on the never-ending road of life.              <br />
       <br />

Music (7/10) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1.4pt<br />
In connection with the overall theme of the anime about teamwork and inspiration, the soundtrack, OP and ED music add-up with the emotional soul of the show. I always like the soothing atmosphere the soundtrack provides, it is relaxing on calm times. The soundtrack impacts me the most when a certain point is reached; especially when it comes to character resolves, the music presented it in the fullest form. This provides characters internal monologues and achievements memorable. Music is always the best way to convey emotions to its audience. It always felt good that you can comprehend the character&#039;s current emotional state by just listening to the theme of the music. The show did a good job with this technique. Even though some moments are objectively dull, but because of the carefully chosen musical score, that dull moment becomes impactful moments of the show. Personally I like the soundtrack and ending theme of the show. &quot;Reset” by Taichi Mukai and &quot;Michi&quot; by Taichi Mukai is certainly going to my playlist. The ED music provides motivational and inspirational good vibes, every time I listen to it. <br />
<br />
Art Style &amp; Animation (7/10) &gt;&gt;&gt; 0.7pt<br />
The art style and animation are alright. It fits perfectly with the theme and characters. I always like the simple design of characters, since I focus to identify them more on their personality. Its mundane atmosphere during calm times is alright, it blends well with the slice of life theme. But I do give it credit towards critical scenarios. The well-crafted change of pacing between mundane backgrounds to colorist/white atmosphere during important character moments, combine with monologues and impactful music composition certainly creates a good formula. Overall the art and animation it’s good for a slice of life, sports anime standard. Even though I found CGI Cars or CGI running men rather disturbing to look up but that’s my personal preference.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (7/10)<br />
Personally I am not a sporty person. I prefer indoor activities more than outside. I like to play on board games than physically exerting myself. I just got interested in the synopsis of the series. And it is a kind of sport that I haven’t seen before. It’s not about boys playing with their balls but rather boys running marathons that are 10km to 20km so I gave it a try. My expectation of this anime direction would be somewhere in the line of ballroom e youkoso about a mediocre character going for the top. Considering studio I.G is adapting it from a material that I certainly never heard off, made it more interesting. Studio I.G had never failed me before when it comes to basic slice of life with sports before.<br />
It’s a good thing I trusted my instincts and experience. Turns out I like the show. Even though it started barely weak in the first few episodes but became more solid as it goes on. I love the moral lessons this show provides, I like its characters, I love the ED music and the animation style. I really enjoy it from the middle to finish.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall Impression (8.4/10)&gt;&gt;&gt; A Solid Very Good Show<br />
I always prefer a show with a slow start but with a solid foundation from the middle to ending, than a promising start with unstable middle and ending. Run with the Wind proves, that even with a basic plot and a basic set of average individuals characters can present a narrative that can rival the sophisticated stories with complex characters. It proves that a deep and meaningful message can be made on the most mundane of setting. I admire the flow of the writing of the story, how it presents and develops its characters overtime is certainly commendable. I wish more anime like this are produce and more people support this type of shows. Run with the Wind is certainly a rare gem for me. The message it represents to me is a tear-jerking a life change experience.

    Are you exhausted of seeing sports anime set in a generic high school setting and want something different ? Are you a college student like me who wants a sports anime they can relate to ? If any of those describes you then I welcome you to the world of Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteru. As an athlete in college, this show has given me the motivation and strength to practice hard everyday and not slack off. Why is that you ask? Well here are the reasons why. <br />
<br />
Story : 9/10<br />
<br />
The story like most people would say is pretty standard but what differs it from the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298296">
        rest would be the charisma and passion exhibited from the main character. 11 episodes in, the story in general is the main character is passionate and dedicated to join an event but since it requires 10 members, he cunningly recruits 10 students by giving them a place to stay while offering them luxurious food . Each episode is amazingly well paced and shows how each character develops. By the time each episode ends, I am already looking forward to see how the story progresses.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
<br />
What i love about this anime is the fact that there is at least one character that anyone can relate to. Each character has their own quirky personality as well as their own personal issues to deal with. With each episode we get to know each character more personally, and empathize with their struggles in life. It teaches me that everyone is different in their own way and we should not judge a book by it&#039;s cover. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound : 10/10<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the best part about the anime. Out of all the winter anime, this is one of the two OPS and EDS I cant skip apart from bunny girl senpai. The OP is played by one of my favourite bands, Unison Square Garden who has played other amazing songs like kekkai sensen ED and ballroom e youkoso OP. When the OP comes on, I immediately have a burst of motivation to run as much as possible till i am satisfied. On the other hand, the ED gives you a sense of nostalgia as you appreciate what youth is all about and makes me want to enjoy the most out of my youth. I can easily say that the ED is the best of 2018.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
<br />
<br />
The artstyle reminds me so much of Haikyuu and it is not an over exaggeration when i say one of the characters is the literal copy of Tobio Kageyama. If you are a fan of Haikyuu, i would recommend watching this anime. The artstyle is highly realistic and makes me feel like I am a part of their world. The characters expressions and emotions are well shown and I can feel each character&#039;s motives and passion flowing out of the screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 10/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Each episode is equally enjoyable and not even a second have I feel bored with the anime. Each episode I go through a roller coaster of emotions ranging from laughter to sadness all the way to anger. Even though it has a simplistic storyline, due to the team having 10 different personalities, it makes it fun to watch how each of them interact with one another and helping each other out while dealing with their personal problems. It is so good that I had to write a review to make sure people are not deprived of such an amazing anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall : 9/10<br />
<br />
I am only halfway through the show, but I can tell that this anime will be one for the history books as one of the best sports anime. Before that happens, watch the first 11 episodes and be amazed by how amazingly beautiful and motivational this show can get. It is not meant for a specific audience and anyone at any age can enjoy it equally. Don&#039;t let this masterpiece be left out as a hidden gem. Upvote this and spread the message.<br />
<br />

    There are various aspects which have to be considered and come into play if we are talking about how a good anime should generally be like. That said, values and priorities in regards to a story and technical features may differ dependent on whom you ask. Well thought out plot, compelling characters or perhaps a focus on visual storytelling-you name it, all of us have preferences whose omnipresence ultimatively dictates our viewing habits and the enjoyment we receive out of something. There&#039;s still one attribute I view  as vital in order to appeal to the audience, namely heart and even more so when it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304379">
        comes to the sports anime. Kaze ga Tsuyuko Fuiteiru essentially embodies the spirit which made me such a big fan of the genre.<br />
<br />
It is also a show that exceeded preexisting expectations. Expectations mainly based on a single name.  Brought to us by Production I.G a studio renowned for their outstanding record regarding anime that revolve around physical activities. Ok not quite tbh, but if we take a look at some big hit&#039;s from this decade like Kuroko no Basket, Diamond no Ace, Haikyuu, Ballroom e Youkoso then it shouldn&#039;t really surprise that I.G has earned a certain reputation in this field and everyone familiar with their sports adaptations of this decade might fully agree.  <br />
 <br />
<br />
The story revolves around Kakeru and Haiji who met by chance. One is an ex competive runner and a prodigy, the other a guy desperate enough to trick his dormmates with the objective of letting Kansei University enter the  Hakone Ekiden. Sounds like a solid premise for this genre. Although there&#039;s a notable difference in direct comparison with the title I mentioned above.  The show&#039;s in question used a narrative that rather focussed on the sport and elemental technicalities, Kaze ga Tsuyuko Fuiteiru on the other hand went more for a character and drama oriented approach. Running in a club served more or less as a catalyst to induce conflicts, trials and self-exploration on the steep road to reach the &quot;top&quot;. Then there&#039;s the fact that it&#039;s setted in university. Good, that doesn&#039;t  sound like a major change up at first , but it allowed to showcase harsh circumstances accompanied by sacrifices which can only occur if you&#039;re in one of the busiest stages of your life. Moreover, I thoroughly enjoyed the cosy ambience of a lively dorm and the seemingly deeper bond of the cast, similar to that of a family. Especially the first episodes capitalized on  that aspect and  it was easy to get warm with the characters. <br />
<br />
Speaking of them, the easiest way to sum up the lot without spoiling much would be to describe them as a diverse bunch or if I take this a bit further maybe even as a group that consists of people whose personalities almost couldn&#039;t contrast more.  While this made up for engaging character dynamics it was at the same time also the ideal breeding ground for several disputes which put the common goal at risk. There were times where it was hard for some viewers not to get aggravated by some actions or attitudes that were displayed. This doesn&#039;t sound very appealing, but rest assured.  After a bit of patience you will get rewarded with amazing individual as well as collective development emotionally striking enough to wash away all unpleasant memories. However, conflicts weren&#039;t limited to be solely of external nature, each Kansei member had his own struggles to deal with and the show dedicated a decent amount of screen time on depicting those in a tangible manner. At this point I might fairly add that time spent on fleshing out characters wasn&#039;t alloted equally and this could&#039;ve evoked the impression that some of them were lacking significant growth. Thankfully,  this most definitely wasn&#039;t  the case. The final batch of episodes in particular took care of that task. They presented a gratifying conclusion to each individual journey. The boys reflected on their past and the last months devoted to running . This ultimatively enabled them to become aware of  how running, an activity most of them were initially indifferent about brought a change to their lifes. These moments truly hit close to home as they were able to convey a wide array of emotions along with a level of relatableness that surpassed everything I had expected. All this made the already enjoyable ride more than just worthwhile. <br />
<br />
What struck me most besides the raw emotional impact I experienced while watching characters I&#039;ve gotten fond of fight against the competiton and themselves was the technical finesse put to display. The running segments were beautifully composed, ranging from expressions of the runner, spectator reactions, inner monologue, animation and OST, everything was in tune.  Regarding the overall animation and art quality, well it was mostly conistent throughout the entire course of the show. Some CGI here, some minor inconsistencies when it comes to the faces ther, but nothing that warranted major criticism in that area or took me out of the experience. It fulfilled the standards you would expect of I.G.<br />
Outstanding in that department was how realistic the running motions looked  and the effective use of imagery. The director did extremely well there and this became already apparent during the first episode. The first encounter of Kakeru and Haiji was without a doubt one of the strongest opening scenes I&#039;ve ever scene and immediately captivated me.<br />
<br />
Coming to the music department and I&#039;m going to make this short. Fantastic! It always fitted to the scene, enhanced the mood and correspondingly the enjoyment by a large margin. The theme songs, especially the first ones, Catch up , latency and Reset were exceptionally good.<br />
<br />
Now onto something, many, especially those who care about accurate depiction and realism when it comes  to technical aspects would most likely take an issue with. Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru didn&#039;t put much emphasis on elaborating details of running nor did it provide a logical explanation how admittedly more or less fit novices were able to perform so well on a high level. Team Kansei surely put lots of effort into their training, but others must have done so as well. Potential viewers gotta ask themselves whether they can stomach a dose of idealism or not. Personally, I didn&#039;t have much trouble to overcome my disbelief  due to plenty of other merits. Foremost, the sheer endless energy the whole story and characters emitted. Then also the fact that an anime about a solo sports had some of the best team chemistry is nothing short of praiseworthy.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I&#039;m gonna talk about my personal enjoyment. Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru was by far the most entertaining show I&#039;ve seen from the last year and it turned out to be way more than I could&#039;ve hoped for. I was totally invested in the characters, I laughed, I felt joy or cried with them. I even started to integrate running in my workout routine again.  On top of that it managed to recreate the exact feelings of the times when I&#039;ve seen my first sports and I hope everyone who&#039;s going to check this marvellous work will experience a similar sensation.<br />
<br />
I gave it an overall rating of 9 due to the set rating system for reviews, but  in my heart it gets without a doubt a full score.

    Do you like running? So let&#039;s run together!<br />
Road with the goal of Hakone is far. But aim for a dream is a good thing. They convinced it, and strive to practice training every day. Who is a genuine runner? Where is college can reach the top? Those answers are there.<br />
<br />
This show is an ensemble cast by various characters. Basically, Kakeru Kurahara and Haiji Kiyose are protagonists. No problem if you focus on them. At first, the development of each character is completely well done. This is a high point. Every character is unique, attractive, likable. And cool. Especially Haiji is my favorite character in this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304370">
        show. I love his looking and personality so much. He is positive and cheerful. Ouji&#039;s bravery is also wonderful. In the beginning, he is drained though, he grows gradually. This is the same goes for other teammates. While almost all characters have all sorts of situations, they&#039;re trying their very best. Sometimes enjoyable. Sometimes strictly. Part of the family. One more thing is this show has many good-looking guys because this show is sports genre. In other words, almost guys. Nevertheless, please don&#039;t avoid it. It&#039;s a waste. Hanako Katsuta. She is a manager who gives grace to a teammate. Her turn is less though, Her cuteness burst pivotal points. Joji and Jota brothers fall in love with her. On the other hand, Kazuma Fujioka. He is Haiji&#039;s friend. Although his turn is less the same as Hanako, really manly and good person. He has presence and charisma.<br />
<br />
Practice, Preliminary round, Actual play&#039;s repetitive. Seems repetition of the same thing, but the truth is different. Drama, Conflict, Growth among them are included. Kakeru has the most complex in the team. He is suffering from a cruel past and unbearable current. Sometimes he let his feelings out. However, Haiji helps him. Because he is very thoughtful of Kakeru more than anyone. Haiji is the leader of everyone. At the same time, he is a companion with others equally. Since Haiji is thinking everyone is like family, he leads the team. He hates lying against himself and people, and it had an effect on his past. Nevertheless, he doesn&#039;t look back. He just moves forward. It is his motto. Otherwise, life itself feels boring. He is thinking about it. I&#039;ve ever also done experiences similar to life. I thought I don&#039;t want to regret it. Results aren&#039;t very fine though, I achieve a sense of accomplishment. I agree with Kakeru and Haiji&#039;s way of life. Although the same goes for every field, if you give up once, become unable to understand yourself&#039;s reason for being. How do you solve it? This show is depicting things like them delicately. Is throwing away the dream your long-cherished ambition? Or while you see eternity, do you aim for your true dream? Only you aren&#039;t lead role. Speaking objectively, I can say that you should broaden your horizons. Rewarding for the sake of the future. In short, no matter what you are to be discouraged...KEEP RUNNING!<br />
<br />
Art and Animation are stunning and beautiful. Running animation is depicting finely. It has always a sense of urgency. The background is also wonderful. The music is also very nice. OP songs of both cour are amazingly cool. ED songs are calm and quiet. In addition, the voice acting is great. Satisfactory. As the constitution of the main story. <br />
<br />
As noted above, there are many characters in this show. So face and name don&#039;t match. Their case is many. Well, it can&#039;t be helped honestly. The introduction looks repetitive over and over again. It may be getting tired depending on the person. Pacing is improved from 2-cour. Endure until there. I disagree with Kousuke Sakaki&#039;s behavior entirely. A lot of emotion theory. Or just bear a grudge. He isn&#039;t suitable as Kakeru&#039;s rival.<br />
<br />
This show is a hidden gem, and at the same time, makes us think about the philosophy of life. How does it look to your present self? Is there something you want to do? I got various inspirations from this show. Intense, Joyful, moved. More than anything, this show is very interesting. Close to a masterpiece. That&#039;s a shame to bury. If you&#039;re interested in this show, worth watching. Really underrated.

    Story (7): The story is neither extremely unique nor really unoriginal, but it is pretty standard story for a sport anime. <br />
<br />
Character (10): <br />
There are various unique, interesting and lovable characters in this anime, and we get a deep-dive in the personality and development of the most important characters, making it really easy to relate to and feel with the characters, as well as making them more likeable and real.<br />
<br />
Sound (9): <br />
OP: Pretty fitting for the show. The opening is chill and all good but nothing outstanding. <br />
ED: The ending is pretty neat, the beat is really relaxing.<br />
OST: (the god) Yuuki Hayashi composed the soundtrack,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293522">
        so obviously it&#039;s gonna be amazing. With such inspiring, hype and beautiful OST every scene becomes better, making all replicas sounds significantly better. This is why I think a good soundtrack is really important, especially in sports animes like this which is more character-based than action-based. <br />
<br />
Art (8): The art and animation is fairly good.<br />
*Fun-fact:  The Chief Animation Director is the same as that of Haikyuu and Ballroom e Youkoso, which is why the art style is so similar in these three animes.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8): Although the story is pretty simplistic, the characters and sound easily outweigh this, making watching the anime a really enjoyable time. <br />
<br />
Overall (8): I&#039;d definitely recommend this anime to anyone who likes to watch sport animes, but also to everyone in general because the combination of unique and interesting characters and a solid soundtrack make watching the anime a delight.

Time to review another one of the MAL top 100! At least at the time of this review it&#039;s in the top 100. Run with the Wind is being hailed as one of the greatest sports anime of all time. While I feel it got a little overhyped and overrated, it&#039;s certainly a good anime and well worth checking out! <br />
<br />
Wind is the 2nd novel from author Shion Miura to be adapted into an anime. The first was The Great Passage back in 2016. Remember that one? It was about a 30 year old guy with autism that struggled with interpersonal skills, but found an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321974">
        ideal career editing a new edition of the Japanese dictionary. It was an extremely unique and ambitious anime, but my old buddy Zeph said it was boring and it got absolutely crucified here on MAL. Since Zeph is MIA, Miss Miura&#039;s 2nd novel got a much warmer reception here...despite actually being even slower and more boring than Great Passage!<br />
<br />
So what is Wind about? This is an anime about a ragtag team of college misfits trying to enter into a marathon relay called the Hakone Ekiden. The H.E. requires 10 runners for each team, with each athlete needing to run between 18 and 23 kilometers. The guy trying to make all this happen is a literature major named Haiji. Haiji is in his senior year and only has one chance to assemble a team and try make this happen. His father was a great track athlete and Haiji himself was an incredible prodigy back in high school. However, he injured his leg and had to take a break from running. A mere injury couldn&#039;t kill his love of the sport though and now he&#039;s determined to gather a team no matter what...by pressuring and pestering his dorm mates. <br />
<br />
The first 10 episodes go like this. Haiji: &quot;Hey, you guys should run the marathon with me&quot;. Everyone: &quot;No! We don&#039;t wan to run the marathon. We&#039;re out of shape!&quot; Haiji: &quot;Come on guys! It will be fun! At least practice with me!&quot; Everyone: &quot;Ok...we&#039;ll at least practice, but we still aren&#039;t running in the stupid marathon!&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#039;s literally all that happens for the first 5 hours. This is the slowest sports anime I&#039;ve ever seen. To be fair, it&#039;s much more of a character study and drama than it is a traditional sports show. It&#039;s adapted from an actual novel after all, not a shonen manga.<br />
<br />
One of the recurring themes of Wind is simply how daily exercise can improve your life. Each character has their own struggles and issues, but the seemingly simple task of running each day manages to help everyone. Daily exercise instills discipline and increases the ability to delay gratification. It also boosts self confidence and improves health. <br />
<br />
Like any drama, Wind is heavily focused on character development. Sadly, I don&#039;t think Miss Miura wanted to actually write 10 characters. She just needed 10 to fill out the H.E. requirement. So we get 2 identical twins who just want to have sex. We get an otaku whose character is that he&#039;s an otaku. Some of the characters like King, Kakeru, and Haiji get wonderful character moments and development, but it&#039;s not evenly spread. To be fair, it&#039;s really hard to properly flesh out 10 characters in just 23 episodes.<br />
<br />
The art by production IG is one of the highlights of the series. This anime looks absolutely GORGEOUS. Not only is it fluid and bright, but also very consistent. Another IG anime I&#039;ve been watching is Vinland Saga, which looks great one minute and then you get smacked in the face with some AWFUL CG. Fortunately, Wind is a lot more consistent. Whoever was animation director really did their job. What&#039;s even more impressive was that this is an entire series about running, which is hard to animate. Walking in general is hard to animate. Why do you think cheap anime like to show characters from the waist up? It isn&#039;t just bad anime studios that fuck up walk cycles. Studio Madhouse back in the 1990s use to do it all the time. Watch an episode of Trigun and wait for any scene with a crowd. Random characters will be moving across the screen at a different pace than their footsteps, leading to what my offline buddy has dubbed &quot;The Madhouse Moonwalk&quot;. Basically, Wind&#039;s animation is stellar. No complaints there.<br />
<br />
Overall, this series starts out slow but grows into something pretty damn good! While I prefer Great Passage, Wind is still a great experience. I tried really hard to avoid any spoilers in this review, but just be prepared for one of the most random, out of nowhere romantic confessions I&#039;ve seen in anime. I don&#039;t want to talk more about that and spoil it, but it REALLY should have had more time play out. Other than that, it&#039;s an anime I recommend. If you like Wind, be sure to support Miss Miura and also check out Great Passage. <br />

    &quot;Haiji... this isn’t just your dream anymore... it’s our dream. <br />
It’s a nice dream. So nice, I never want to wake up.&quot;<br />
I too would never like to wake up from the dream that has been Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru, or Run with the wind. This is an anime that has touched my heart more than any other work of art I have ever experienced in my twenty years of life. I&#039;m writing this review immediately after viewing the final episode, and I am truly grateful for this series.<br />
The underlying theme of this series concerns youth. In college, we are pulled in so many directions, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304399">
        have to focus on our futures and our careers more than ever. This series has taught me that these are the years of my life that I cannot allow to slip by. I must take full advantage of my youth, and live it to the fullest alongside my friends and my family. I believe that any college student, or soon to be college student, can learn much from this series and these brilliant characters, and I sincerely hope that my words will reach at least one person in this world.<br />
I was a runner in high school, I loved it and I hated it. I love to run, but I don&#039;t love to race. I quit after two years, and didn&#039;t run once my entire senior year of high school, and freshman year of college. This series reintroduced me to the joy of running. Since episode 1 aired last October, I run almost every morning with the show&#039;s beautiful OST on repeat.<br />
I vehemently recommend this series, and rate it 10/10; a masterpiece.<br />
The Merriam- Webster dictionary defines a masterpiece as &quot;a work done with extraordinary skill<br />
especially : a supreme intellectual or artistic achievement.”<br />
I cannot express enough with words how truly this defines Run with the Wind, a series that showed me in just 23 episodes the most interesting and inspiring character development I have ever come into contact with.<br />
I laughed, I cried, and after 23 episodes I feel that this series will stay with me as long as I live. When watching a weekly series, I always used to wait, and let them stack, so that I am able to binge and more easily digest a show, but never could I do this for Run with the Wind. Never once could I wait even a second to watch the show that moves me more and more with each episode. The three week hiatus in the middle was so frustrating that when the series returned I cried uncontrollably, to my family&#039;s dismay and amusement.<br />
&quot;I finally understand. Whether I run or I don’t, it hurts just the same. Even if I fail, I want to do what my heart desires here.&quot;<br />
Haiji, Kakeru, and the rest of the team feel like truly important people in my life, and amazingly I am able to deeply relate to all 10 of them. I think that any runner, that any college student, that any youth can relate to these masterfully written characters, and experience their triumphs and their misfortunes as one&#039;s own. Never have I enjoyed a cast of characters so much, and learned at least one valuable lesson from 10 individual characters in a work. Prince and Haiji will forever inspire me!<br />
<br />
&quot;This world is too beautiful.<br />
But that’s okay.<br />
My love hasn’t changed. Never has. Never will.<br />
I like running.<br />
I love it.&quot;<br />
I like Run with the Wind, I love it, and I think both socially and philosophically it is one of the most important artworks of our generation. <br />
Don&#039;t waste another second of your youth, get out there with your friends and strive for something greater than yourself. Never doubt yourself, and never act like someone you&#039;re not. These phrases are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the vital life lessons to be learned from Run with the Wind, but don&#039;t take my word for it. I insist that you view this series for yourself, and maybe, just maybe, you&#039;ll have the same beautiful experience as myself. <br />
What is strength? What is running? What is living? Watch Run with the Wind and find out.<br />
<br />
Edit: I forgot to mention the two EDs are my ranked two favorite EDs of all time! So great to fall asleep to :)

    First of all, unique in terms of other &quot;outgoing MC&quot; animes. If you slightly like sports or into it, this anime will make you wish that it never ends. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, what makes an anime great is the ending and the desire to watch it one episode after another. BUT, i just realized that might not apply on all of them. Sometimes the process of waiting and building into a good story with a direct legit art, is all what it takes. <br />
<br />
Beside when it comes to sport anime, you need to have faith in Production I.G, hope to see more of their works...

    I never really enjoyed any sports anime ever before watching this anime. The reason I never liked any sports show was simple, you see all any sports anime ever did was just putting so much effort on the sports itself that they forget to develop the characters who are the essential part of the anime(looking at Haikyuu, yuri on ice and free).<br />
<br />
I was really shocked to see a anime about running that does not show any character running until ep 5 or 6, I mean how sports anime do that these days. Rather then making us show the characters running from the start it takes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304374">
        that time to develop the characters itself, because what good a shallow character is to the show. And mind you this anime has a lot of characters that need ample to develop and shine in limited amount of time, but damn not a single minute of any ep is wasted and its pure story-telling and good characters dynamics.<br />
<br />
I wish I had anything to complain about this anime but this anime does not let me do that because its that good, I really like how Haiji interacts with with other characters and how genuine he is. Also how kakeru goes from being a antisocial to just being friendly with everyone, its just  heartwarming. And akane is my soul animal, really he is so relatable and puts so much effort to come out of his comfort zone for something that only benefits other the most.<br />
<br />
This is how a sports anime should be done and every other sports anime should take notes from this. If you want to know what a really good sports anime looks like then you need to watch anime.

    I&#039;ve heard some positive murmurs about this anime and, after re-watching &#039;Haikyuu!!&#039; for the tenth time, I decided to check out another Production I.G. anime. Maybe it wasn&#039;t such a great idea to watch a new sports anime right after watching one of my all time favorites, but my opinion would probably remain the same regardless: it was underwhelming. <br />
<br />
The premise is promising and its characters are strong but its execution of plot elements and overall execution is underwhelming. It relies too heavily on the viewer&#039;s innate suspension of disbelief to progress the story where it wants to go. It was a bit of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316037">
        struggle to get through the beginning third of the anime because it presented a lot of conflicts but had no satisfactory solutions for them. The characters were the strongest aspect of this anime but I felt that there could have been a lot more background and character development with them. I rarely cry but there was one moment near the end of the series that was incredibly emotional and moved me to tears. <br />
<br />
There were good moments but there were too many moments that I disliked that prevents me from rating this higher. I am aware that this is an anime but you can&#039;t simply introduce very realistic stakes and parameters and choose to disregard them when it&#039;s convenient. I don&#039;t think I would recommend this to anyone.

    *Insert Stupid Quote&quot; Reviews nowadays are either filled with people having unpopular opinions and people liking them a lot, or some guy who writes an entire essay on why the show is a &quot;masterpiece.&quot; Personally, I try and watch for enjoyment instead of picking apart every little thing within an anime. Anime, in my opinion should be watched with enjoyment rather than be slammed down by little tiny flaws that lowers the overall &quot;score.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now I am going to tell you why I enjoyed this anime, instead of breaking down every detail. <br />
<br />
I must admit, the synopsis is bad. However, if the synopsis is holding you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304380">
        back from watching this anime, fear not. I feel as if they included some of the most irrelevant information possible. If you are even considering watching this anime, I hope that I give you the push to watch it.<br />
<br />
This anime sort of follows a very &quot;sports&quot; arc where they train and hope to go to nationals. However, when watching the anime you find that instead of focusing on the &quot;sports&quot; aspect, you are more focused on the characters. That is what set it apart from any regular anime. I love each of the 10 main characters and their personalities make it easy to like them. They all are struggling with something in their life within the sport and outside. Although they don&#039;t like to show the weak side of them, each of them makes a commitment to change, especially our main character, Kakeru. When characters grow in anime, I think that has to be the most satisfying thing ever. Even though the anime After the Rain and Violet Evergarden have nothing to do with &quot;sports&quot; I still felt similar vibes from them.  <br />
<br />
When the anime tells you about who they are as individuals, seeing them succeed makes me happy/satisfied. Seeing things not go as smoothly as I thought was a nice change of pace. Within a race, anything can happen and if you aren&#039;t feeling 100% it won&#039;t change the fact that you are going to do the race still.<br />

If you aren&#039;t sold at this point, this anime was developed by Production I.G. I am sure that you have watched other anime that have been made by them such as Attack on Titan, Kuroko no Basket and especially Haikyuu!! So why not watch this one as well? On top of that, this anime went from around a 7.4* rating from week one to 8.24* rating. <br />
<br />
This is for the people who want individual marks on the aspects of things. <br />
------------------<br />
Art - 9.5<br />
Never gets in the way of things which is all I really care about. *It was beautiful*<br />
<br />
Sound - 9 <br />
Opening 1 was amazing and Opening 2 was forgettable. Either way, it enhanced my experience rather than ruining it. <br />
<br />
Character - 10 <br />
All of the characters I loved :)<br />
<br />
Story - 10<br />
Loved each of the backgrounds and what they had to do in order to overcome obstacles within their live. Finally, something about college stuff instead of high school. Lets go!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 9<br />
Basically the only thing that matters. The only reason this wasn&#039;t a 10 is because at times I felt the ending of an episode was a little bit lackluster. <br />
<br />
------------------<br />
To everyone. At least give this anime a try as I think it won&#039;t hurt. What is also kind of weird is that the main character looks a little like Kageyama from Haikyuu!! I also liked the little bit of comedy in there as well, made it an added bonus. The drama is also totally justifiable instead of just starting random fights with no reason behind it. Although I tend to find my opinions unpopular, I decided to write this review because I just like writing about things that I enjoy. I hope that you can at least give this anime a chance and feel free to let me know your opinions about this anime as well. <br />
<br />
*P.S*<br />
If you are a runner, I feel as if this is a must watch. Without spoiling too much, we find out early on that Haiji, one of the main characters is injured and goes through a phase in his life where he is completely unmotivated.  Any sports anime that has a character that I can relate to is always nice since I can feel as if I am not alone in the situation that I am in. Personally, since I have flat feet which can lead to a lot of problems, you always have to find a way to overcome and adapt. Prince is also relatable since we all used to be slow runners :)<br />

    Fall 2018 has been a pretty good season, some might even say it&#039;s great. Among all of the shows I&#039;ve seen so far, Kaze ga has got to be one of my favorites. And I&#039;m surprised at how underrated this show is right now, considering how enjoyable and good it is. I haven&#039;t watched a lot of sports shows AND I&#039;m only writing this after watching 6 eps (I&#039;ll probably update this when I have more things to say), so of course take my opinion with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
First, probably the weakest aspect of the show so far: the story. Now, I don&#039;t want

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293875">
        you to think that the story is trash or anything like that. It&#039;s actually pretty good. The thing is that we&#039;re only getting started and taking things slowly, which is certainly not a bad decision since this show is gonna run (heh) for 24 episodes.<br />
<br />
Moving on to the art and animation, I gotta say that this is one of the better looking shows of the season. The art style is very similar to another show adapted by Production I.G.: Haikyuu!!, but what really stands out to me is some of the shots and little scenes, like at the end of episode 1 and one of the scenes with Kurahara in episode 4.<br />
<br />
The &quot;sound&quot; aspect is also pretty good, the OST fits nicely with the tone of the shows and the scenes and it&#039;s generally very pretty and calm. The OP by Unison Square Garden is one of the best (in my opinion of course) of the season, with some nice visuals too. The ED is also really good, with it&#039;s nice, catchy electronic/modern vibe.<br />
<br />
And now, probably my favorite aspect of the show: the characters. Usually if you&#039;re not going to have a super flashy or original story, then I&#039;m hoping you&#039;re going to show some good characters. It&#039;s hard to describe what exactly makes these characters so good, but one of my favorite things is how they interact with each other, especially Haiji with the rest of the members. Their personalities are also pretty distinct and good, matching some of their designs and shit. Plus, it&#039;s refreshing to see a sports story with characters that are on college and not on high-school.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the characters, the show is very enjoyable and actually doesn&#039;t have a lot of dull or boring moments. I had a good time watching them practicing or doing every day stuff. The animation and OST also help to make some of the scenes more enjoyable and interesting. I could see the lack of really important events turning off some people though.<br />
<br />
Overall, Kaze ga is one of the better shows of the season so far, thanks to it&#039;s large cast of characters and good technical aspects. While there&#039;s not a lot of exciting running stuff happening, the story is building up and could end up being really good. If you haven&#039;t watched this show, please give it a chance because it&#039;s one of the most underrated shows in the season and deserves some attention.

    I don&#039;t like running,<br />
never thought i would watch an anime about running or anything running related, well gave it a shot, its not half bad.<br />
in fact it is really damn good.<br />
<br />
the running theme can be actually translated to any other activity, or even job or a dream. or anything.<br />
<br />
the characters are amazing, the story is cool.<br />
there is not a single bad thing that can be said about the series.<br />
<br />
so overall the series are 9/10<br />
<br />
it would take a real effort to hate the show, and thus if you considering to watch it, you would probably enjoy it.

    I&#039;m not gonna lie to you guys okay? The ending was a bit rushed. Like, they could&#039;ve pumped it to 25 episodes instead of 23. But maybe I&#039;m only saying that because THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ANIME I&#039;VE EVER SEEN, AND I WANT MORE OF IT.<br />
<br />
Okay, where do I start? The soundtrack is absolutely amazing. Not just the openings and endings, but the background tracks are so, immensely good at setting the mood for this anime. The art is GORGEOUS. It&#039;s hard to explain what exactly I love about this art style, but I&#039;m hoping to find something similar to it in the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304393">
        future.<br />
<br />
But, that stuff&#039;s boring. Let&#039;s get into the good stuff. The story was... wow. It&#039;s such a simple premise, but wealth of meaning and inspiration found in it is remarkable. I will say that I would&#039;ve loved to see a bit more character development for these boys beyond running, but all in all, the main story was very well paced, and it had such an impact. The story itself made me feel connected to it because of how well it was written. It sucked me in every episode. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll tell you what, though: the characters are what&#039;s gonna hook you on this anime. Specifically their relationships with one another. I think there&#039;s something really powerful in the way that this anime has presented strong friendships between these guys. I loved seeing how different characters supported each other or how they changed over time. It felt like a camaraderie that&#039;s rare to find among people. These characters are funny, their complex, they cry, they laugh; they&#039;re everything they should be and more. They&#039;re special, and that made the anime special.<br />
<br />
I really cannot recommend this anime enough. It&#039;s something that I think a lot of people are going to come away from different than when they went in. It&#039;s very touching and inspiring story, and I&#039;m really glad I took the chance to watch it. Excuse me while I go cry because it&#039;s over.

    Truly a masterpiece!<br />
<br />
Story : 10/10<br />
Art : 9/10<br />
Sound : 10/10<br />
Character : 10/10<br />
<br />
This anime is one of the best sports and positive anime.<br />
100% recommended for sports animes.<br />
<br />
Story:-<br />
(Spolier)<br />
The story resloves around the main person Haiji who is a long distance runner suffered from leg injury but still wants to run at the national event.<br />
He does fulfill his dream by convincing everyone in best possible and realistic way and they did reach to the Hakone Ekiden, by registering scores for all players and also securing 10th in the qualifying round<br />
<br />
The best part is that the whole story goes ahead perfectly step by step like Prince&#039;s timings eventually reached to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304731">
        mark, etc.<br />
They just showed whole 10 months of their running in a perfectly manner.<br />
<br />
Sound :-<br />
The voice characters perfectly match up to give a real experience of their running and all talks.<br />
<br />
Art :-<br />
Perfectly drawn art and animated properly except Kakeru&#039;s face which changes along the season which is not satisfying.<br />
<br />
Character :-<br />
All ten runners are unique in their own.<br />
They have tried to cover characters of every type possible.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : <br />
10/10<br />
<br />
If you have patience or have habit to complete series which you have started then this anime will give you that for sure.<br />
As said ahead, this anime moves step by step perfectly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also its very rare that an anime has moved from 7.46 in week 1 to 8.47 in week 23. <br />
<br />
Honestly, anyone would give it a 7 or 8 until 11 or 12 episodes, but after then the fun starts.<br />
<br />
This series is truly inspirational and one of its kind.<br />
