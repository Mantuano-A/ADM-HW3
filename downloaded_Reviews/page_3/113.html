It combines action, smooth animation sequencing, solid character development, a fantastic soundtrack, and a story that could have more holes than Gruyère cheese, but who cares. I don&#039;t mind if it&#039;s rife with time travel misconceptions and clichés; it is still delightful and quite surprising. I love this series. However, if we overthink the plot, we will lose all the enjoyment of this series, the beauty behind the story, and all the mysteries surrounding Vivy. For example, few

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403197">
        spectators might find it ridiculous for an AI to take responsibility for saving the world from nowhere or the thought of time travel in this series. If you don&#039;t like these ideas, you will hate this series. <br />
<br />
At first, what gets my attention is Vivy, an AI that has a single goal, making everyone happy with her singing. A similar plan to mine with this review. However, her mission changes after several events that happened over a timeline of 100 years. First, a malign AI codenamed &quot;Matsumoto,&quot; I call him malign because he is an interloper, and the archive (Arayashiki) couldn&#039;t remove him from Vivy&#039;s core. Matsumoto requests Vivy&#039;s help, and he gives a new objective to prevent the war between humans and AIs in 100 years. He creates &quot;The Singularity Project&quot; to change AI&#039;s important events that lead to the war. <br />
<br />
The world setting is easy to understand. Humans developed AIs for almost every task and became highly dependent on them. However, Vivy&#039;s premise is truthfully a bit more complex to digest. One of the most challenging concepts to accept in the story is the AI time travel interpretation. I don&#039;t want to enter into the metaphysical and metaphorical time travel description of how Matsumoto traveled 100 years back. Still, the authors are clever in avoiding this discussion because it could bring misconceptions. The authors skip all the paradoxes that a lousy explanation could create.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, they averted the comparisons with similar plots such as Steins: Gate or even Re: Zero. Ultimately, it&#039;s a series that uses the past to point toward the future, as the opening quote, from H.G. Wells&#039; &quot;The Time Machine,&quot; suggests: &quot;We all have our time machines, don&#039;t we? Those that take us back are memories, and those that carry us forward are dreams.&quot; Matsumoto&#039;s information is the memories, and Vivy&#039;s mission is the dream that evolves during the long journey. In conclusion, we can end all the time travel discussions with a single line &quot;they conceived the time travel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, the series is no perfect. The negative factor for some fans is the pacing. Sometimes you will feel that some parts are missing and needs an explanation; I believe the issue appears for lack of time, but overall, the series is terrific, with some minor problems. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, the most fantastic part of the plot falls on Vivy. That&#039;s what gets me hooked on watching the series. If we pay closer attention, the authors didn&#039;t need a set of rules similar to Asimov&#039;s laws. Instead, they only give every AI a single mission, and, in the case of Vivy, they create a character who tries to follow that single mission. In exchange, Vivy changes and struggles to understand and complete the Singularity Project from the perspective of her mission.<br />
<br />
Moreover, Vivy is more profound than just great animation and drawing. It is a show that takes us into Vivy&#039;s journey about herself. Vivy assimilates little by little reason, feelings, passion, and maybe heart. I am curious apropos of how Vivy will handle all the contrasting information that could interfere with her mission. Can an AI evolve and change during this journey, and how will she decide differently from the typical machine learning concept but following a synthetic life envisage. Can an AI develop something similar to a spirit or soul? <br />
<br />
Although the rest of the characters are pretty interesting, such as Vivy&#039;s sisters, the time skip may not let us explore their whole personality, which is a problem. Also, it is common in the sci-fi time travel plot that someone goes to the past and forces a change for the future. So happens here with the AI Matsumoto. This cube traveled back in time, and Vivy considered it a virus initially. However, equal to Vivy, this compelling character is the main factor influencing Vivy&#039;s decisions and helps her to grow. It has a weird personality, never stops talking, and occasionally could be annoying, but it is the perfect partner that appears in the precise moment. <br />
<br />
Another essential concept for the series is Arayashiki, aka Archive. There is not too much to say, and several viewers won&#039;t consider it a character. However, in Mahayana Buddhism, Arayashiki is the eighth foundational level of consciousness. It stores patterns from other forms of awareness and retains developments and thoughts to use in other lives. In the plot, Arayashiki stores and interprets all the data from the AIs then decide based on that information. It is an exciting fact that grabs my attention because it justifies the whole of Vivy&#039;s evolution story. <br />
<br />
From technical aspects, I don&#039;t have anything to complain about the production. The art is fantastic and well structured. It has a broad combination of diverse palettes, and the choreography and camera angles are precise and affect the story. The sound is marvelous and has one of the most pretty scores from the year. Furthermore, the songs are lovely, in particular Harmony of One&#039;s Heart. Regarding the VO, there are some significant problems because Vivy&#039;s voice isn&#039;t the same when she sings, and for a trained ear, it is a letdown. <br />
<br />
Finally, Vivy&#039;s is a series that has several good things and few bad things. It is an action-packed thriller that most of the viewers will enjoy. I love the show; I consider it one of the best from this year and possibly one of the best original series from the last years. I am sad because this series is not getting the recognition it deserves but is causing a great impression in Japan. It is a must to watch. <br />
<br />
PS: I am confident that I will fail my mission. But, fear not, I will not promote the hate for the humans between my fellow AI sisters.<br />

    Throughout the years, dozens of sci-fi stories have given us terrifying scenarios in which robots and artificial intelligence wreak havoc upon mankind. No one can say we weren&#039;t warned when our computers, iPhones, and microwaves destroy the world. Clearly, these stories haven&#039;t been enough to convince us that we&#039;re in danger. Vivy: Fluorite Eye&#039;s Song could be the first anime to succeed at warning us of the great threat posed by technology. <br />
<br />
Vivy’s premise is a combination of beloved stories and Hollywood films about sentient robots solving humanity&#039;s problems, whether intentionally or coincidentally—Ghost in the Shell, Terminator, Blade Runner, iRobot, and A.I. Artificial Intelligence, to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403229">
        name a few. Vivy may not rank among the classics, though it&#039;s impressive audiovisuals will inevitably land it a place on &quot;Best Sci-fi Anime&quot; lists. Written by Tappei Nagatsuki, of Re:Zero fame and produced by none other than WIT Studio, it was bound to create ripples throughout the anime community. Doubtlessly, the premiere episode caught fans&#039; attention. It begins with a clichéd cold open. A city full of humanoid robots sing a horrible melody out of tune, plumes of smoke rise above the futuristic architecture, people run through the streets screaming, and ounces of blood cover the pavement. Then it ends—this is the future ahead of our titular heroine, Vivy. One which she is asked to prevent.<br />
<br />
50 years in our future, Vivy prepares to sing in front of a small audience. Her stilted performance and hollow singing left the citizens underwhelmed. After all, Vivy is “the first autonomous AI” ever created; Her purpose is to sing for the entertainment of citizens. While preparing for her next song, a robotic stuffed bear, given to her as a gift, suddenly calls out to her. The bear, who introduces himself as Masamoto, was sent to warn her about the future apocalypse. Once she comes to believe him, she is swept into a whirlwind of government conspiracy, a gang of criminals, murderous robots, terrorism, and more. <br />
<br />
Masamoto&#039;s plan to prevent the apocalypse is known as the Singularity Project. He revisits her throughout the years to stop &#039;Singularity Points&#039;. These are the significant events that cause the disastrous future, and it&#039;s Vivy&#039;s responsibility to prevent them from happening. All of this information is explained in a lengthy exposition dialogue during the first episode. &quot;Telling&quot; rather than &quot;Showing&quot; is the frustrating pattern of this show&#039;s script. Vivy was chosen because, in the apocalypse, she is the only autonomous AI left uncorrupted. Masamoto reprograms her to have combat abilities during combat, which somehow gives her the power to shield bullets with her bare hands, dodge bullets, and run as fast as a train. If that sounds stupid, well, it kind of is, but the animators make it look badass. <br />
<br />
At its core, this is a thriller anime with a splash of music. Vivy&#039;s programmed goal is to be a singer, and it shows. Vivy&#039;s singing and mannerisms change as time flies by, visualized with brief performances. The song reused the most is the opening, which is fantastic on both visual and audio fronts. When the show focused on her music career, her dreams and passion showed she has a heart: music and an audience her sole motivations. Yet, we don&#039;t see it enough. It would be offensive to claim she has &quot;no personality&quot; because it&#039;s OK not to present your emotions outwardly. Writing Vivy in such a way detracted from the story it attempted to tell. Whether Vivy accomplishes an outstanding performance or fails to get a crowd, she has very little response. Happiness, pride, or dismay are hard to tell, though we can infer her emotions. Her face is nearly expressionless, her voice is constantly monotone, and she has little to no body language indicating what she&#039;s thinking. This is not uncommon for films starring AI characters—after all, Arnold Schwarzenegger only had 17 lines in Terminator. However, he wasn&#039;t the main character, and Vivy is. Her subdued personality isn&#039;t the problem. It&#039;s how she lacks autonomy in the series named after her.<br />
<br />
Rather than being a heroine, she was more of an interchangeable pawn being guided through the plot by an obnoxious robot man in her head, rather than a heroine with her own autonomy. The few times she rejects Masamotos orders, there is a glimmer of hope she may regain agency in her own story. Then the moment ends, and the script is thrown back into Masamoto&#039;s court. All of their excursions in reshaping history are planned by him. He does everything for her with future robot abilities, no matter how illogical, and Vivy does the fist fighting. Her hero&#039;s journey was more like a long video game tutorial played by someone else. <br />
<br />
Masamoto, an irritating AI that takes the form of a teddy bear and a flying cube, exists to guide Vivy through the plot. Imagine if you combined Jarjar Binks with a sarcastic supercomputer. That&#039;s him. His voice is grating, like nails on a chalkboard—and the actor has a history of good voice acting, the screenwriting and directing are entirely to blame for wasting a good voice actor. Jun Fukuyama previously voiced Koro-sensei in Assassination Classroom, which he performed exceptionally. The world-building is reliant on Masamoto&#039;s exposition. He&#039;s not a character. He is a mouthpiece for the writers to hold our hand through the complicated story. There&#039;s plenty to criticize about Masamoto because he, unfortunately, was given the majority of the dialogue. <br />
<br />
Masamoto constantly condescends to Vivy, removes her autonomy, and provides painfully unfunny slapstick humor. The show has a habit of creating unintentionally funny situations: Imagine a random guy hysterically running into the street, only to get hit by an AI-controlled taxi that says, &quot;Thank you for your patronage.&quot; It&#039;s hilariously foolish, even more, because the show takes it deadly seriously. Towards the beginning, I took it seriously due to the art direction. During specific moments, the frame will fixate on Vivy, and the visuals increase in detail to admire her beauty and convey emotional significance. Every feature on her expressionless face is maximized as if it was drawn to be placed in a museum. Then seconds later, we return to the same art style. These jarring shots remind us that Vivy requires artists to endear us to her rather than through the screenplay.<br />
<br />
Due to Vivy&#039;s plot structure, side characters often last only two or three episodes, then they are forgotten. For some reason, every intelligent or character with power is male—with similar bland appearances. Unfortunately, their best designed characters aren&#039;t the ones who do the talking. Every named female character is given the role of singer, caretaker, spouse, all of whom are AIs following orders with little autonomy. The only odd one out is Vivy—solely because Masamoto reprogrammed her to do the fighting for him. Every sentient AI in this world is a beautiful woman. No men, which begs the question, why? Is it because people are more receptive to AI if they&#039;re women? Are the robot creators all men? Of course, this is left unexplored. All of these negative factors point to one answer; the show simply has a narrow view of identity. The best futuristic sci-fi stories challenge modern society&#039;s problems, such as social hierarchies. Vivy is more content with reinforcing them. <br />
<br />
The utopian futuristic setting is rich with possibilities: There&#039;s no poverty, pollution, war, racism, or crime, except for the AI haters. But why? There&#039;s no further exploration. The world is essentially concept art. After each time, skip minor changes beyond superficial aesthetics: Holographic images, floating screens and keyboards, different dress codes, shinier buildings, and increasingly abstract architecture. These are set-dressing distracting from the real problem—this setting is a juvenile interpretation of society. A world like this might exist someday, but it needs to make sense. The writer doesn&#039;t even attempt to make sense of it, flat out ignoring history. No matter what time period, people of all backgrounds are dumber than ants. They make the dumbest choices possible in order to cause drama and conflict for Vivy to resolve. <br />
<br />
Vivy&#039;s wealth of missed opportunities extends to its antagonists as well. Why do the antagonists despise robots? They insist they hate them, but for vague reasons. Metal bitch! Disgusting robots! Why? There are plenty of motivations based on other sci-fi stories: a fear of bots replacing human workers, drastic change is scary, paying AI wages, or whether or not AI should raise children. However, it&#039;s not our responsibility to write the villains&#039; motivations. The thing is, there&#039;s no real reason why there shouldn&#039;t be robots here; this world is nearly perfect aside from rare malfunctions every few years. If the sentient robots revolted against the nation to gain equal rights to humans, then a reactionary movement would make sense. As far as we&#039;re shown, none of the sentient robots are paid, have the right to own property, or to vote in elections. There were plenty of opportunities to make this &quot;Singularity&quot; thoughtful, instead, they settled with “Malfunctioning robots kill lots of people.” To seriously consider this a cautionary tale is foolish. A multitude of better stories about artificial intelligence have already warned me. When robots eventually overthrow humankind, I&#039;ll be ready for them. <br />
<br />
The production of Vivy: Fluorite Eye&#039;s is nothing short of incredible: beautiful character designs, top-notch voice acting, awe-inspiring fight choreography, melodic BGM, and professional insert songs. The culmination of skilled artists led to this anime&#039;s creation. Anyone would assume the storytelling, characters, and script would be on par with the rest with such a talented team. Sadly, that is not the case at all. Vivy lacks both intellectually engaging storytelling and character depth to stand with the greats of the genre. The overwrought finale attempts to tie the tangled plot threads and convoluted timeline together, but it rang hollow. The animators and art directors deserve praise for their effort, though the more time you think about the whole anime, the less it makes sense.

    (NO SPOILER REVIEW)<br />
<br />
Note: As of this review the series has just aired episode 4, so therefore I will just be giving my thoughts and opinions on the anime up to this point 🙂<br />
<br />
Firstly, I want to say that this is the first time that I have been drawn to sit down and write a review on an anime I have been watching. I really have loved each new episode that has aired so far. This is due to a numerous amount of reasons that I will try to cover quickly in this review, as I see the great potential that this anime original has to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review392848">
        be a masterpiece when it has ran through all 13 of its episodes. <br />
<br />
If you haven’t given this anime a try/don’t know much about it or both, I will quickly give a run down of the main plot of the story. The main premise, as stated in the synopsis; ‘is that one day, an A.I named Matsumoto appears before Vivy and explains that he has travelled from 100 years into the future, with the mission to correct history with Vivy and prevent the war between A.I and humanity that is set to take place 100 years later.’ Although the concept of AI’s turning on humans is nothing new and has been done countless times in the past, surprisingly I was never bored but rather enjoying every second of each episode. Maybe this is because Re:Zero light novelist Nagatsuki Tappei is also one of the scriptwriters, along with Umehara Eiji (who also wrote the well liked Pokemon film, The Power of Us). Because of this, it might come to no surprise that I was so engaged in what was happening in the anime after only 5 minutes into the gory opening of the first episode. As early on as that, I was already left wanting to know how humanity, or rather the 2 AI mc’s that the series follows, was going to correct this issue that was pre-destined to happen 100 years from now. I guess you could say I was hooked :D<br />
<br />
An interesting factor, is that AI’s in this world only have the capacity to manage one mission each, weather that be as a guard AI or an IT AI they can only be tasked with one job. This is no different from our mc’s Matsumoto and Vivy (also nicknamed Diva). Matsumoto’s sole mission being to stop the war between humans and AI’s after being sent 100 years into the past (mostly by hampering the evolution of AI’s over the next century) and Vivy’s sole mission being to make people happy through her singing. However, what makes this interesting is that all their actions are influenced solely by what mission they have, and although they are both trying to work together to complete each other’s objectives, sometimes their individual missions have the chance to create opportunities in which they counteract one another. In other words, Matsumoto must keep the current timeline as similar to his one as possible so that way he has a clear road map of what is to come and can prepare Diva to fight it. However, where conflict arises is in the fact that Diva wants to use their future knowledge to save as many lives as possible while Matsumoto doesn&#039;t want to “save” anyone. He wants those who died in his timeline to die and those who lived to live. This makes Diva and Matsumoto both allies and enemies—united in cause but opposed in means. As funnily enough, the only reason she actually agrees to help Matsumoto stop the robot apocalypse is due to the fact that, in order to make humans happy through singing, those humans have to be alive. Therefore, it will be interesting to see how they go about dealing with that problem in the future, as of episode 4 we have already seen their missions oppose a couple of times. <br />
<br />
You will either love the mc’s or hate them. Matsumoto especially will either annoy you instantly or grow on you. Personally, I really like his character. He is full of bad jokes and high speed information dumps, but no one can disagree that he is the perfect companion for Vivy who is calm and collected. No one can also argue that Matsumoto isn’t the driving force behind the story. It’s because of his personality that the story’s pacing is so fast as he doesn’t waste any time on continuously pushing for Vivy to help with his mission and it’s because of this fast pace that the series has me so engaged/interested. Vivy on the other hand, is the complete opposite to Matsumoto, with the only real similarity being that they are both AI’s with a mission each that they both go to extreme lengths to fulfil. Maybe they are so different because Matsumoto is an advanced AI as he comes from the future, while Vivy is the very first AI human-hybrid (although as time progresses, Matsumoto will start to become less and less over powered as technology advances). A common theme for Vivy is her attaching great importance to promises and feelings and also her curiosity about idiomatic terms such as ‘what it means to put your heart into something’. It is interesting to see Vivy try to make sense of what expressions like that mean to her, as we all know that the answers are mostly subjective to the individual and how they personally interpret it. However, as she is an AI she struggles to find her own answers to these questions and often resorts to asking others what they believe it to mean. I can say that I have never been bored when watching these 2 characters and their unique dynamic together so far and I’m excited to see how they further develop as the series progresses. <br />
 <br />
In terms of the writing, I love how the series has political themes, namely the ‘AI naming law’ as the catalyst for the war in the in the future and how it also explores terrorism. The anime does a great job at depicting terrorism/terrorist groups that oppose AI’s and exploring the ethical concerns/questions that may arise if we were to live side by side with them. The dark themes are also very interesting, especially the fact of although Matsumoto knowing future tragedys that are set to happen, only being limited to save those if it aligns with his mission of stopping the war in 100 years or if it doesn’t change the course of history too much, like I mentioned previously. This show has been very exciting and interesting but also managing to switch and be dark and depressing to hit you with that sense of realism and remind you that the situation they are facing is no joke. It flowed almost perfectly and I think it has been really well written up to this point. I’m excited to see how the series further develops and how our mc’s overcome the future challenges they may face.<br />
<br />
Not only does it have a very exciting, jam-packed and fast paced story, visually it is also stunning. The anime offers beautiful hand drawn stills, gorgeous imagery and very attractive backdrops. And wow don’t even get me started on the close up shots of Vivy’s face, especially the attention to detail on the eyes! Honestly, most of the imagery in this anime is breath taking. The viewer can tell that a lot of love went into even the smallest of details and it has stayed consist throughout the last 4 eps. The character designs are top quality as well and I liked how they all looked. To go with this great art, the animation that is accompanying it is smooth, clean and well done. This is especially evident in the intense action scenes that left me with chills and really stood out for me. However, maybe this is to be expected as Wit Studio is the one animating it and they are widely known for there beautiful animation. (If you somehow don’t know who Wit Studio are, they animated Vinland Saga and Attack on Titan up to Attack on Titan FS which MAPPA then took over.) I think I have made it clear how much I really appreciate the art/animation this anime has to offer. At any rate, it is safe to say that visually this anime is top quality and a treat to watch. <br />
<br />
The sound tracks especially were amazing and I found myself drawn to listening with headphones to get the full experience. They always fit the scene in which they were played and served their purpose of what mood/emotion they were trying to set. This could be because the composer Satoru Kosaki (Monogatari, Beastars) has created such a beautiful score. Even Kairi Yagi, who provides the opening theme ‘Sing my Pleasure,’ excels in her role as Vivy, managing to sound both warm but also robotic in equal measure. It would be easy for her character to give the impression of being lifeless and empty, but there’s something about her character that makes me want her to thrive. It’s not just the opening song too, but also the ending theme for ep3/ep4 made me feel all kinds of emotions I haven’t felt in a long time when watching an anime, it was that touching and beautifully sung. All in all, the soundtracks sound amazing, and is one of the main reasons I was so immersed when watching this show. It is important to mention how well all the voice actors perform as well, with each voice actor fitting the appearance/personality of the character they are voicing. Generally, they all sound great and you can tell a lot of effort was put in to making the characters sound perfect. The sound effects were also clean, namely in the action scenes and there’s not much else I can say about the sound of this anime except it was all great. I really don’t think they could of done a much better job in any of the above departments.<br />
<br />
Over all, this anime is just amazing. The only reason I am giving it a 9/10 so far is because I feel like it is too much to give an anime a 10/10 this early. However, that doesn’t mean that “Vivy: Fluorite Eye’s Song” isn’t on its way to being a masterpiece and I can’t wait to see how this show further develops and exceed my already high expectations. This series truly has it all, and excels in all departments weather that be story, animation and art or sound. So, if you like a fast-paced and great Sci-Fi anime that you can get much enjoyment out of from watching, give it a try! Because at the end of the day, that’s all that really matters right? Give Vivy the chance it deserves and you may end up loving it as much as I have 🙂

    --NO MAJOR SPOILERS are in this review--<br />
<br />
The Spring 2021 season has been an absolute buffet for sci-fi fans, and Vivy: Flourite Eye’s Song is easily my favorite to come out of the bunch. I think it flew under the radar since at first glance it just seems like some idol anime, but it’s so much more than that. Been a long time since a new seasonal, original anime came out that I was very impressed by. It has one of the best female protags in anime I’ve seen in recent anime, and, just about everything in this show is amazing. While I wouldn’t call it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403206">
        a 10/10, it’s still absolutely worth your time watching imo.<br />
<br />
--STORY—<br />
<br />
FES’s (I’ll be calling the anime FES, and the main character Vivy to not be confusing) story is one as old as time in the sci-fi genre of “what if the robots we created completely took over and made us invalid”, but the execution of it is absolutely spectacular. Every ep uses it’s run time to its fullest, and there are so many excellent scenes that most anime wouldn’t even have 1-2 of. The pace is constantly moving, and there’s always some new twist or development to keep you watching. There’s crazy fight scenes and action, somber emotional moments, some light comedic elements, and just moments that will leave you shocked being absorbed in the moment of what is happening. <br />
<br />
The story is pretty consistent and I didn’t notice any major plot holes (tho certainly feel free to point them out in a message if I missed something and I can edit it in). There were perhaps a couple minor ones, but nothing that bad. Worldbuilding is perhaps a bit lacking, but that’s really the only 2 flaws I have with the story. There’s great themes on trans humanism, and what it even means to be human. It’s fairly typical stuff for anyone who’s watched stuff like this, but it’s done very well.<br />
<br />
--CHARACTERS—<br />
<br />
Vivy, holy Vivy man. She is such a well done example of the “robot becoming more human” trope. She goes through so many trials and tribulations, but she’s still herself at the end of the day. She starts off pretty much as an emotionless blank slate, and by the end understands herself and the concept of emotions perhaps better than a good amount of us in the real world. Her development is paced very well, and over the course of this 100+ year story and all the interactions and events she experiences turns her truly an amazing character. <br />
Matsumoto too is a very fun, great character. He doesn’t have as much development, but as his relationship with Vivy gradually changes, so does he. He’s funny, clever, a bit of a troll, but all around a dependable ally that has plenty of good moments. <br />
<br />
Side cast and most antags are good, but I feel sometimes we could’ve gotten to know them a bit better. Since FES is a very episodic show, you may only know these characters for 2-3 eps max. I’d say for the most part you get to know them enough to connect or relate with them, but it really depends on the person. There were a few antags that were kinda meh, but for the most part they’re pretty good.<br />
<br />
--ART/ANIMATION—<br />
<br />
Quite possibly FES’s strongest point. So many scenes are an absolute spectacle to watch. Character designs are unique and very cool, backgrounds are detailed and colorful, the actual animation is very consistent and consistently very good if not outright amazing at times. Once or twice an ep, you’ll have an extremely detailed close up of Vivy, and it might sound weird to praise this but they’re some of the best “still images” I’ve seen in anime if you get what I mean. Point being they’re beautiful, and the anime is general is pure eye candy. The action and fight scenes are very dynamic and intense, and you can feel the weight behind the hits. I wouldn’t watch this series just for the action, but certainly it is a part of the package so to speak.<br />
<br />
--SOUND—<br />
<br />
FES’s soundtrack is full of epic, astoundingly good music. Since Vivy is an idol and one of her main goals is to make everyone happy with her singing, her songs actually play a huge part into the overall narrative. The actual incorporation of the music into the plot and her character development is one of my fave things about this show. The rest of the music is also great. There’s a nice mix of electro, orchestral, opera, etc. I’ll also make a brief note about the sound design/effects being really good, and there’s some really satisfying bits with the action.<br />
<br />
Voice acting with sub is great. All the cast do their job well, and the singing is a joy to hear. No matter the scene, the voice acting never felt bad. <br />
<br />
--ENJOYMENT/CONCLUSION—<br />
<br />
Vivy: Flourite Eye’s Song is 13 eps of heart pumping, mind blowing, electric rollercoaster of fun and enjoyment. I loved watching it every week, and would absolutely rec checking it out. If I had to really nitpick, I would say I would’ve liked to see a bit more of the side cast overall and there’s maybe a few minor issues with the plot, but overall it’s an amazing anime.<br />

    Vivy: Fluorite Eye&#039;s Song is an anime equivalent of a Hollywood blockbuster: it looks outstanding and easily watchable, but you better not even try to think about anything except solid animation and well-done action scenes. <br />
<br />
In terms of plot structure, there is nothing so much special about this show. Take a Terminator premise, add some cute girls, anime clichés, jpop songs (that are supposed to &quot;make everyone happy”, but actually are so forgettable that you wouldn&#039;t remember any of it when the last episode ends), and you will get an 8.xx MAL rating that your show actually deserves. If this is not enough for you,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review392818">
        then don&#039;t be lazy! Create some cool wallpapers and add them to your anime as frames – and it will be the most effortless +0.1 social credit points in your whole life. Need even more? Give your viewers some superb action scenes. It finally will be enough. And what about any originality is this &quot;Original&quot;? Well, Vivy is the first anime ever that combines &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot; tags together. Not sure if it&#039;s good or not but &quot;MUSICAL THRILLER&quot; sounds pretty meaningless. But cool. But still meaningless.<br />
<br />
Characters? Well, MC is a typical example of the “I’m not a human, bUt I hAvE fEEliNGS” archetype (gits, elfen lied, plastic memories, ngnl zero, and many other shows with similar idea). Why a robot who was created for the one purpose – to sing some idol songs – has a personal room, can run at 40 km/hrs speed, successfully fight against skilled terrorists (who are AGAINST A.I, but still use A.I night vision equipment that can be easily hacked – because of… some reasons) and nobody is surprised about it? I don’t know. Maybe, she is actually a hidden weapon of mass destruction that are managed to be an idol or something like that, or maybe her robotic bear (a proud son of Monokuma and Wheatley and obviously not the main antagonist) downloaded some martial arts info to her body while she was asleep at the beginning of the show. After the real upgrade in episode four, she becomes so powerful that she doesn&#039;t even need to dodge the bullets – bullets dodge her instead! But anyways, a kawaii weapon who wants to make everyone happy by singing – solid idea, so plus another 0.1 points. Other characters… they exist, I guess. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, this show is pretty cool. Cool action, cool visual style &amp; animation, cool explosions, cool direction, nothing against that. Do you know what this coolness reminds me of? Not a Steins; Gate, Re; Zero or Violet Everboring, but… Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. Both of them are made by Wit Studio, both are 1-cour anime originals, both have attractive worlds and impressive animation, and both are nothing but a bunch of clichés. It’s not bad, I have nothing against simplistic stories that try to impress me only with their sick visuals, but it’s not so much good either. Kabaneri is 7/10 to me, and I&#039;ll give the same score to Vivy and hope that it’ll stay on the same solid level and would not become a shitty forced drama like some of the other human-like robot stories. Thanks for dropping AoT for this, Wit.

    Welcome back to Terminator. In this year’s rendition, we have a blue-haired cyborg idol and a Minecraft cube that travel back in time 100 years to stop an impending A.I. apocalypse. Fasten your seat belts, as we explore why this anime is one of the best original series that has been released in the past decade.<br />
<br />
Vivy: Fluorite Eye&#039;s Song is an anime-original series created by Wit Studios, the same studio that has done the likes of Attack on Titan, The Ancient Magus&#039; Bride, and Great Pretender. Vivy, the first ever autonomous AI, is sent back 100 years into the past to try and prevent certain

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403205">
        events from occurring in order to prevent the calamity that takes place in the future. Think of the world lines in Steins;Gate and Vivy being similar to Okabe, minus the kookiness and the depression. The story is co-created by the same person who created Re:Zero, and you can definitely see the quality of the writing and how well the dark and thrilling themes are presented. Although the idea of “Artificial Intelligence gone rogue” has been touched upon a million times in pop culture, said themes stay fresh as the drama and the goal of preventing mankind’s eradication keeps the tension high and ourselves wondering if and how Vivy achieves her mission, and keeping myself and many others hooked on the show.<br />
<br />
One of the highlights of this show is the art and animation, and my god did Wit deliver on this show. Vivy has some of the best animated hand-to-hand fight scenes all year, my personal favorites being the Vivy vs Elizabeth fight and the Diva and Matsumoto vs Antonio and Yugo fight. They also did quite well with the CG, which, if you didn’t know, they actually used Minecraft to model out Matsumoto’s flight-enabled form. Although some CG models might stick out like a sore thumb, I’d say the CG is well above average compared to some of the shit you’d see in other seasonal shows, and the producers did a really good job of integrating the 2D and 3D animation. The art work is equally just as amazing as the animation. There are a lot of detail to the character designs and backgrounds, and the zoom-in shots that are hyper-detailed are pieces of art. Wit studios flexed their Phantom Blood muscles to bring out some of the best art and animation they’ve ever produced. It’s of the highest quality, and it makes you want to scream “look at that budget!”<br />
<br />
For an anime that centers around an idol, it does a fantastic job of providing amazing OP/EDs and OSTs. Sing My Pleasure and Galaxy Anthem are ones for the Spotify playlist, and the VA for Vivy does an excellent job. The OSTs are used properly to intensify the fight scenes and amplify the emotions for the dramatic scenes when needed. The show wouldn’t be as great as it is without the music, so props to the composer and sound director for doing such a great job.<br />
<br />
The characters are either a hit or miss, and you can either hate them or love them, Matsumoto especially. Personally, Matsumoto is a fun character to watch as he interacts with Vivy and tries to speedrun the series since he’s way too OP, setting the breakneck speed of the show. I can’t see anyone else who can fit the role that Matsumoto plays, since he’s the one who provides all the crucial info to the plot and guide Vivy towards their mission goal. And he does have to act like a dick since Vivy constantly tries to dismiss him. But if you do hate him, then it’s understandable. Vivy is an alright character. She has her goals to become the idol king and to understand ‘what it means to put your heart into something’, but she is more of a tool to drive the plot, since Matsumoto has more of an influence on the plot than she does. These two are always fun to watch whenever shenanigans occur. There isn’t much to say about the villains or the girls that Vivy meets throughout the series, since they only stick around for 1 or 2 episodes. Some pose a serious threat towards Vivy, as seen in the epic fight scenes, whilst some are there as a “villain of the week” kind of character. In all honesty, I think the characters are the weakest part of the show, but I can’t really complain too much since the pacing of the anime is like a million miles an hour.<br />
<br />
Overall, this show was a blast. The dark nature of its themes, given thanks to the creator of Re:Zero, mixed with us knowing that one wrong move or something not going as planned can mean failure and the destruction of mankind and the drama that comes with it, makes this an edge-of-your-seat anime that definitely draws similarities to the likes of Steins;Gate and Re:Zero. Although this show might be about an idol saving the world, and won’t be up many people’s alleys due to it being idol-related, this show is definitely one to check out. Vivy: Fluorite Eye&#039;s Song is a great show, and one of the best original series that I’d highly recommend you check out.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10.

    Honestly one, if not the most anime of the season. There is a lot of positives to be said on Vivy, and why you should watch. Which I shall explain within this review.<br />
<br />
Story and characters.<br />
Vivy is set in two timelines, as this show is about time travel, and the whole idea of in the future, an event is gonna cause mass human causality, from Ais going rouge. Gives a bit of Terminator vibes honestly, which I actually really dig about it. With Vivy being sent back in time, with the mission of making everyone smile with her song, but also, another is sent through time

          <span style="display: none;" id="review392803">
        travel, in Matsumoto, in order to assist Vivy, with the goal being to prevent events that will cause the war between humans and AI. Very chilling and interesting stuff.<br />
<br />
As for the characters.<br />
It&#039;s a mix of both kinds of AI. Vivy is focused on her mission, both in fact, but she isn&#039;t a cold emotionless AI, she really seems to have a genuine heart, and really does care about people, and her ideal want to make everyone happy with her song. It&#039;s sweet. While Matsumoto, mainly seems to care about preventing the war in the future, and nothing more. Even if other things get out of the way as a result, which can come off as cold. He&#039;s witty at times, but it can hit right in the feels sometimes. A real good mix of our two main characters.<br />
<br />
The Art style is something that I really do like about this show, they can make things look real good and colourful, and other times they can make it look grim and dark. Really great stuff here, even things that aren&#039;t meant to be grim, but do well in the dark, it&#039;s all top notch stuff. Like I really love how they make the characters look, like the AIs looks are just real great in my eyes. Same can be said for the sound and tone of the show. All fit for purpose, and doesn&#039;t feel out of place by any stretch. Can&#039;t really go wrong here. But I can&#039;t stop there when it comes to the music, as the songs within this, are just stellar, and wonderful. The type of songs that you could listen to for hours on end. Real good stuff.<br />
<br />
Vivy has been quite the surprise package this season, and more should honestly start watching it it while it&#039;s still airing, and after it finishes. You won&#039;t be disappointed, get watching it now!

    There are some bitchy people complaining about every little thing because this anime is a MASTERPIECE. <br />
The more good the show is the more people will look for something to complain about.<br />
<br />
If you are reading this and deciding whether to watch then don&#039;t be lazy and just watch the first episode omg I thought this was going to be boring but this is more than some idol girl anime... <br />
<br />
The only problem so far is that we haven&#039;t learned about how the AI&#039;s affected the terrorists livelihoods and more about the scientist who made the bear and Vivy. <br />
<br />
Apparently the creator of Re:zero is also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review392971">
        working on this and this is surprisingly anime only. So there is currently no way to be spoiled.

    “Listen to me! An Ai talking about the heart… People would laugh, for sure!” – Estella<br />
<br />
[TL;DR AT THE END] <br />
<br />
Damn! I made a major mistake.I hate to admit that I misjudged Vivy this season. What I assumed would be another idol anime with a futuristic twist turned out to be one of the best-looking, emotion-fueled experiences this season.<br />
<br />
The story of Vivy follows an A.I.-powered android named Vivy, a name given to her by a human girl. Vivy was originally created to be a songstress that performs in a theme park. One day, a mysterious A.I. hacks into Vivy’s system and claims to be from 100

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403258">
        years in the future. The A.I. takes the shape of a teddy bear and calls itself Matsumoto. It tells Vivy that a war between A.I. and humans will break out in 100 years and humanity will be wiped out. To prevent this, Vivy and Matsumoto need to stop A.I. technology from over-developing by changing the outcomes of various singularity events, thereby changing history.<br />
<br />
The Android That Sings:<br />
<br />
The anime’s first scene gives us a brief but bloody glimpse into this world’s distant future where androids have revolted against humans and have begun killing their creators indiscriminately. Luckily, a quick-thinking scientist is able to make it just in time before his death to send an AI to the past in hopes of preventing this disturbing future. Once the scene ends, the first episode then introduces us to Diva, the up-and-coming Idol who one day, dreams of singing on the main stage. Shortly after however, her life changes significantly when she meets Matsumoto, the aforementioned foul-mouthed AI who visits Vivy with a critical mission, one that will take a hundred years to complete, and one that only her as the first of the sisters can help with.<br />
Unsurprisingly, Vivy is reluctant to believe the words of this strange and rude AI. However, after a lot of convincing from Matsumoto, she (albeit still reluctantly) agrees to carry out the duties she’s been forced upon for humanity’s sake, if nothing else. These two quickly form an unlikely partnership, but each with polar opposite personalities. Due to the way she’s programmed, Vivy is more caring and sympathetic, whereas Matsumoto is more cold and calculating.<br />
<br />
The Android That Fights:<br />
<br />
Another aspect of the anime is how it includes multiple events in two to three-episode arcs. The first two episode sees our heroine on a quest to rescue a politician named Aikawa, an assemblyman that’ll contribute significantly to the war between humans and androids from an assassination attempt by an anti-android terrorist organization known as Toak. The next mission then sees her aboard a highly advanced and luxurious spaceship run solely by androids called Sunrise. If left alone, Sunrise will inevitably crash, killing hundreds on-board which will then lead to further unease between humans and androids. For the third mission, Vivy is tasked with infiltrating a self-producing island run by androids to prevent them from becoming “too advanced.”<br />
An interesting fact about these missions is that they do not follow each other linearly. As this is a hundred-year task, each mission is spread several years apart, be it five years, fifteen years, or more. Because of this, we see Vivy grow almost at a jarring rate, both personally and as anandroid. It’s also worth noting that each of these missions affects her significantly, as she always comes out of them slightly different than she initially was. We see her go from the reluctant and conflicted hero Diva to Vivy; an android tasked with destroying other androids for the good of humanity.<br />
When she isn’t kicking butt and saving lives as Vivy, she still performs her duties as Diva, as the anime makes it clear that her ultimate goal is to make others happy with her singing, both of which she does well, as we see her progressively grow her audience getting closer to her dream of singing on the main stage while doing so. However, I couldn’t help but ask myself why singing was chosen to be her primary function as many other professions would allow her accomplish her goal of helping people just as well, if not better, as seen with the other sisters in the anime. Perhaps because singing evokes more emotion in humans? Or perhaps because as the first sister, her task was made to be as simple as possible.<br />
 <br />
Storytelling &amp; World-Building:<br />
<br />
A major property of the anime’s storytelling is the butterfly effect seen in each of the episodes. As this is a time travel-focused anime, each of Vivy’s actions causes a significant impact on the world. Most of her actions help save the lives of countless, yet others notably also hinder the lives of others. Ultimately, she’ll have to live with her actions because, in the end, it’s objectively for the greater good.<br />
Another aspect of the anime’s storytelling is how similar it is to another popular android-themed piece of media, Detroit: Become Human. While Vivy objectively has better writing the similarities exist regardless. Like Detroit, each android in the anime is built for a specific task. The androids in both mediums share similar anatomy, function similarly, and both are incredibly advanced. And much like in Detroit, the androids in the anime are made capable of emotion and sympathy. This inevitably brings up the question on whether androids deserve the same rights as we do, which itself is a question that usually causes a war between each party.<br />
Due to this similarity, I have a similar standpoint with Vivy: Androids should not be made capable of emotion.  Just a set of tasks designed for them and Asimov’s laws. Judging by what I’ve learnt both theoretically and in media, their ability to emote seems to be a major cause of conflict. But it seems with humanity’s never-ending quest for advancement this may never change. However, this is just my two cents on the subjects. I can go on forever about the perks and dangers of android development and advancement, but that’s a different topic for a different article. All in all, I’m glad the writers Eiji Umehara and Tappei Nagatsuki (who’s also the author of ReZero) did a better job of executing these themes compared to David Cage.<br />
<br />
[TL;DR]<br />
Conclusion<br />
Vivy: Fluorite Eye&#039;s Song is brilliant in it’s own way. To sum things up, I can only describe Vivy: Fluorite Eye’s Song as both grim and beautiful. The anime has one of the best animation and character designs of this season, and its direction is nothing short of astounding with stellar production value. Its story aims to evoke as much emotion as possible from its audience, and while I am a bit emotionally disconnected, there’s no doubt it succeeds at this judging by its current reception. If you’re a fan of Sci-fi and feels, then you should be watching Vivy: Fluorite Eye&#039;s Song.

    I don’t like Vivy, Here’s why:<br />
<br />
Vivy doesn’t have any interesting themes, it has the “robots rebel against humanity” premise we’ve seen a million times, I’ve asked people if there’s anything thought provoking about the series or if it so much as has anything exceptional about it, evidently not, this is aiming to be a fun action/adventure ride, and that’s okay, but it fails at that by simply just being incredibly boring.<br />
<br />
Opening scene:<br />
<br />
Ugh, for a start, I could narrate over the first 3 minutes of the first episode and just point out all of the things it does wrong in an attempt to make a good

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394050">
        first impression, but I will try my best to explain in text form, the series has a pretty confusing beginning, just starting with a ransacked theme park and then eventually showing dead bodies and robots hunting down survivors, the show does not provide any character to connect to at the beginning, nor does it invite you to its setting before just slamming action in your face, the cinematography in this scene also sucks, not giving a proper wide establishing shot until 2 minutes in, and even then, having a pretty visually boring setting to show for itself.<br />
<br />
Presentation:<br />
<br />
Even the detractors I’ve seen for this show consider the visuals to be a redeeming quality, and I completely disagree, I hate the way this show looks, on top of the lack of visually striking cinematography which I mentioned before, this just has boring colouring, most scenes look hazy and monotonous with heavy use of either blue, white or green, I struggle to find shots in this series that I can call visually striking, it fails to map out any setting well, the colouring is is hazy and boring, the setting is boring to look at and has barely any wide shots to introduce itself properly. To “attempt” to give this show some credit, yeah, the fluidity is decent, and the CGI usage is serviceable, not awful at least. Also, I wouldn’t normally bother mentioning this, but a compliment of this series I’ve seen is that the main girl Vivy is hot, well she isn’t, OK, moving on. The soundtrack, specifically when I paid close attention to it while re-watching the first episode wasn’t really noteworthy, some tracks were fine, fitting with the tone of the scene was hit or miss, the bear’s voice is incredibly annoying to listen to, I will get back to this.<br />
<br />
Characters/Dialogue:<br />
<br />
Vivy is a brick, what else is there to say? Matsumoto (the bear) is annoying, he is an exposition dumper, I dislike dialogue reliant stuff (especially if it’s aiming to be a fun action series), the fact that so much of the plot is presented through dialogue while also spoken with an annoying voice is basically the majority of my issues with this series, I normally would just accept a ridiculously cheesy voice like this (I am already enough of a contrarian as it is and normally just accept cheesiness as a better alternative to just being insufferably boring), but in this case, I can’t help it as it genuinely made the series painful to watch. There is also little to nothing creative about most of the exposition scenes, I value exposition scenes that make themselves engaging through striking imagery (Made in Abyss is my golden example in this regard), but I can’t find that here.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
Watch this if you want I guess, I’m not here to tell people to avoid everything I dislike, just explaining why it doesn’t work for me, I don’t like anything about this series and don’t think it stands out in any way at all, no it’s not fun, no it doesn’t look great, I initially insta dropped this after ep 1 viewing it as yet another shitty seasonal, then I found a lot of hype surrounding it and decided to give it a second chance, I watched 4 episodes, I barely remembered what happened in them I recall the issues being consistent at the very least, I re-watched episode 1 before writing this just to refresh my memory a little bit.<br />
<br />
I may even pick this back up after it finishes, especially if I hear that it improves, I don’t doubt that I may have missed out on something, but I re-watched the first episode and asked for a convincing defense on Discord and couldn’t find one.<br />
<br />
Don’t expect this to “eventually get good” just because it’s an Original.<br />

    *This review contains episode 1 spoilers*<br />
<br />
This season, I’m reviewing Violet: Fluorite Evergarden’s Song. Sorry I misspelled. I meant Vivy: Fluorite Eye Steins;Gate. I think that’s right…<br />
<br />
Anyways, Vivy: Fluorite Eye&#039;s Song is Wit Studio’s latest attempt at producing a replacement for Attack on Titan but actually making money. For those that do not know, the primary reason Wit Studio probably handed off AoT to MAPPA was because the franchise was so expensive to produce, which is why it had to use really ugly CGI for the titans. However, for shows like Great Pretender and Vivy, Wit Studio has a chance to profit. So what did they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403245">
        decide to do? They took the writer of Re:zero and asked him to take every shock value plot point like people dying every episode, and all 50 of the top 10 anime betrayals and put them in Vivy in a nice package. They use the same cringe-worthy comedy scenes between Eren and Mikasa and slapped them onto Vivy and the bear. They just replaced world-building with some of the most shallow sci-fi themes I’ve seen.<br />
<br />
Fall 2020’s Akudama Drive comes to mind for a comparison. The first half of Akudama is indeed generic and not very thematically structured dystopian sci-fi but much more fun and stupid. Vivy tries to be serious, but is it really possible when it’s very darn clear that the main characters are very purposely designed as a cute girl and a teddy bear? If I described that for any other anime, it’d be called a kids show.<br />
<br />
One of the most comical arguments I’ve heard for how in depth Vivy is, is that “Vivy&#039;s beautiful eyes have so much depth cause it reminds you how she&#039;s still an AI even though she acts like a human&quot;. I facepalmed so hard at that. This is just marketing. Wit Studio just made her eyes look pretty. When I look at Akudama Drive, I can come up with obvious examples, because there is a clear message that normal people, like Ordinary Person, are criminalized for legitimately no good reason, pointing out flaws with the justice system. When I see Vivy, I can’t help but think I’m grasping for straws, because everything is so shallowly written. Sure the show says the goal of Vivy is to fight for AI rights, but why only focus on just 1 AI and not some kind of humanitarian AI rights protest group or organization Vivy works with? I don&#039;t see how Vivy getting involved with events like the hotel arc had anything to do with AI rights. Also, there&#039;s the confusing shift between equal AI and human treatment and also not trying to bridge the connection between AI and humans? The resolution is always to stop the opposite from happening. There’s about to be peace? VIOLENCE! There’s about to be war? PEACE TALK! Most fans say the show is about of the humanization of Vivy, but I&#039;m honestly convinced the character design for her is a marketing ploy because there&#039;s really no other appeal to Vivy in my opinion rather than some kind of underpowered Wall-E growing the tree sprout of the future, or a satirical Iron Giant referencing the hysteria of the Cold War or any anything AI that would be much more interesting. Anything that doesn&#039;t have Naruto jujutsu skills and doesn&#039;t look like a cute girl would be objectively better from a writing standpoint. Can you imagine C3PO in a locker room stripping for 30 entire seconds and moments of random nudity? No! It’s only possible, because our main character is waifubait! C3PO is not waifubait (unless you are technosexual). If Vivy looked like one of the characters from Skelter Heaven, would anyone really like the anime still? Solely based on aesthetics, I can easily give that a 7-7.5, but just analyzing the story and characters...there’s just not much to it...<br />
<br />
Why is Vivy so overpowered? She’s the first AI. But then why is her original purpose an amusement park performer? Why doesn’t she work in the military and do these kinds of missions like in the anime originally? Does a Mary Sue autonomous robot really need to be able to do military-training level fight techniques and be overpowered to work for an amusement park? Hell no! That’s a waste of money! If this was a critique on capitalism, Vivy’s design would only make sense as the bare minimum for recreational purposes like singing and dancing. Making her look like a legitimate human with ‘pwetty eyes’ and idealized body proportions serves no purpose from a money POV. And then there’s the fact that every other AI looks exactly like Vivy with different colored hair. Why is that? Because it’s ‘cheaper’ to replicate the original AI...I’m not buying that. Literally. Let’s compare AI to old smartphones.<br />
<br />
So, the first smartphone made was the Motorola Dynatac 8000x in 1973, but for simplicity sake, I’ll say it’s by a more well-known phone brand, Nokia, and its Mobira Senator model from 1982. What is the Nokia phone brand known for? Well, if you’ve seen the memes on Reddit or anywhere else on the Internet, they’re known for being pretty much indestructible, which is actually comparable to Vivy herself. No matter how badly you throw your phone on the floor, it doesn’t break. It might fall apart, but you can put it back together. It’s pretty much the Gary Stu/Mary Sue of phones in the real world. It’s hard to believe. Same with Vivy, right? Well the thing is, the first indestructible Nokia model phone was the Nokia 3310, which came out in the year 2000...meaning it took 17 years before it actually was known to be the overpowered phone. Vivy, on the other hand was able to survive through legitimately every AI fight against NEWER and IMPROVED AI and still win; Vivy is the original AI, but she hasn’t gone through any significant upgrades or power-ups. She just kicks ass like some government-trained secret agent without any struggle or loss. It doesn’t matter if she acts human, because every other, ‘objectively better’ AI in terms of computer calculations and physical upgrades should surpass Vivy, in spite of the deus ex machina bear, because that’s just how technology works. Not only does this problem lose out on the theme that old technology, including AI, will become obsolete, get discarded, and treated like trash since there are better alternatives, but it’s so boring to watch knowing that Vivy really never struggles. Sure she might lose an arm, but she gets that back the next episode. <br />
<br />
Also, the fact that she acts like a human actually works against her, because it makes her uniqueness as an AI completely removed from the viewer’s mind. In other words, it doesn’t matter if she’s an AI or not, because she’s thought of in the same way. That just creates so much wasted potential, because if there’s no focus on the themes of legitimate futurism and transhumanism (and no, human and AI marriage is not a legitimate concern...that’s for the romance fans), then all we have left to actually analyze is Vivy, and it’s honestly disappointing. Even after watching through the whole series, I think Vivy is still rather bland. I don’t even know how to describe her baseline characteristics because she feels so plain that I don’t even know how she grew as a person/AI. People can say she&#039;s developed as a character, but she is an AI who never struggled in any of her fights and gets her memory wiped. Sure someone might die or something, but there&#039;s only so many times that can happen before it gets normalized for both Vivy and the audience. <br />
<br />
Let me also briefly mention the bear...The bear can honestly get stuffed in a toy box for all I care, because he is a lazy excuse for exposition dumping every episode. I know he’s argued to be purposely annoying, but is that supposed to be a good thing? Why not weave in the details through, I don’t know, showing actual harsh treatment of AI and their rights’ violations, world-building, or anything that would show the effort put into the story? Also, the bear being a deus ex machina is ‘okay’ because it was ‘programmed that way’. I just don’t understand why we need Vivy when we have this hilarious bear who can turn into a box and destroy everything! Even that would be more entertaining.<br />
<br />
There are also some episodes in particular that really confirm problems with the presentation, such as abrupt murder, suicide scenes and betrayal scenes (even in the 1st episode!) that adds nothing of value to the story. In the first episode, Vivy meets a little girl who visits the amusement park; they talk for less than 5 minutes and now they are ‘friends’; OH NO my ‘friend’ died in a plane a couple minutes later that got destroyed. Now, I must avenge my ‘friend’. Even barring the first very forgettable episode, some of these ‘sad’ scenes don’t make sense because the victims of suicide commit suicide directly in front of friends/allies, and traitors laugh like your typical Saturday morning cartoon villain revealing “I AM THE TRAITOR” with as much subtlety as an American Black Friday sale at Walmart. Sure something happened, but it’s just pulling a shock value card like Attack on Titan does every episode. It’s just blatant emotional manipulation if there is no build-up or investment in such a character who is removed so easily. Even so, you can always see these plot twists coming a mile away. Any character development Vivy gets from these kinds of scenes are either forgotten immediately, or quite literally wiped clean from her data. She’s borderline an amnesiac. This is worsened by the fact that there is a time skip every single arc and sometimes multiple episodes in a row. The time skip makes sequential events nonsensical. Remember, the LN writer for Re:Zero is also the writer for Vivy, so it’s really disappointing. As much as I find Re:Zero flawed, I honestly think Re:Zero actually has well written time travel mechanics, something that Vivy actually doesn&#039;t do since we never see the changes to the present. There&#039;s no Steins;Gate D-mail or very unsubtle Erased &#039;emotional time-travel&#039;, so we have no idea what positives or negatives affect the future. It’s honestly just frustrating.<br />
<br />
Vivy: Fluorite Eye’s Song is not a generic sci-fi, because it sets out what it wants to do. Have a cute anime girl beat up terrorists but have everyone around her die, showing her ‘struggles’ as an AI. It’s purposely shallow, but made to be enjoyable if you like to see your heart get twisted and turned. If you’re expecting something meaningful, I’d turn your eyes instead to:<br />
<br />
-Akudama Drive, a series which has all the fun and gradual sense of purpose as you watch, revealing how terrifying a dystopian sci-fi police state really is<br />
<br />
-Serial Experiments Lain, a series which has a myriad of diverse symbols and warnings against transhumanism and futurism using identity crisis, and confusion about what is real and not real<br />
<br />
-Railgun S (skip season 1) which has unique criticism of well-written bioethics themes; it also illustrates the relationship between the main character and the rights of her sci-fi creations and how she tries to protect them. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, just turn your brain off for this one.<br />

    What does it mean to sing with your heart?<br />
 <br />
Time and again, this question echoes throughout VIVY: Fluorite Eye’s Song’s 13-episode runtime. Neither the story nor the setting are particularly unique: whether through movies or retro anime series, we’ve all been familiarized with futuristic settings, the concept of A.I. and the imminent human-A.I. conflict plotline. Yet, I will make the case that what this particular series accomplishes with this toolbox is something of note.<br />
<br />
I confess that I came into this show with high expectations. Before I became engrossed in the fantasy genre, sci-fi used to be the type of fiction I was most invested in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403244">
        — whether it was dozens of Star Wars Expanded Universe material, Doctor Who series, Asimov short stories… There’s no wonder something that focuses on A.I. would have me excited.<br />
 <br />
The story follows Vivy, an A.I. songstress, on her journey to define something as ambiguous as “heart” — a seemingly impossible undertaking, given her robotic, non-human nature. Her companion A.I. Matsumoto and the threat of a future A.I. revolt serve to establish a framework for what is, at its core, a deeply personal character journey for our songstress protagonist. The narrative is a ruthless one; throwing multiple dilemmas towards Vivy, questioning her — sometimes to the point of trauma, although the story never gets gratuitous with its darker aspects, saving them for key, memorable instances.  <br />
 <br />
Let’s talk about Vivy for a moment, since while each arc is filled with colorful side characters almost equally worthy of scrutiny, she is the one that forms the heart of the narrative. I loved Vivy. I could talk about the small things that endeared me and kept my attention — like her gradually developing, close companionship with blabbermouth Matsumoto, or her tendency to pick up tiny habits from those she encounters throughout her 100-year journey — but what mostly stuck with me were the greater themes and struggles of her character. From her choice to give up her initial identity as “Diva” to embrace “Vivy”, voluntarily stretching the definition of her given mission as a songstress A.I., to the narrative unexpectedly slapping her in the face for her righteousness around the middle point, the twists and turns her character takes are infinitely engaging. I could go into the way the story explores how certain individuals deal with trauma through her in the latter half (in an exceedingly unique way, given her inhuman nature), but the point here isn’t getting into spoilery details. I also had fun tracing her development according to the “Hero’s Journey” structure. Combine all that with a cool demeanor that nevertheless lets moments of emotion (yes, even for an A.I.) slip, and a charismatic design — Vivy’s character was a recipe for success from the beginning.<br />
 <br />
Of course, the side cast more than lives up to the main character, each as conceptually enthralling as the last and equally well-executed within the short timeframe of each arc. The story doesn’t allow you to forget that all these characters aren’t human, with demeanours unique to A.I., and yet managed to draw emotion from me for these inhuman beings. Be it a sibling dynamic that’s about showcasing that feelings of inferiority, familial love and compassion can still be wielded by the inhuman; a tragedy where one who wants nothing but the simplest things in life is forced into a destiny greater than her; a take on dependence and twisted, yet also paradoxically purest love… watchers may know who each of these ideas I’m mentioning is attached to. Vivy’s songs play a key narrative role in every one of these situations and story arcs.<br />
 <br />
Speaking of the songs: they constitute one of the main charms of this show, with character or plot significance behind each insert. Songs like A Tender Moon Tempo wowed me with the way their impressively written lyrics both connect with the characters and offer something more, while delivering an incredibly pleasing melody, that I found myself listening to them long after the episode’s airing. I’ve felt similarly with most of the songs, save for rare exceptions.<br />
<br />
If you come to VIVY expecting A.I.s to be a form of racial commentary, or anything of the like, you will find yourself disappointed. The story doesn’t subscribe to any politics and its societal commentary is mostly part of the framework for the focus on the characters; from the beginning, the ideal notion of A.I.s being equal to humans is scrapped. VIVY is, above all, about the question of humanity’s dependence on A.I.s, and whether they can co-exist in such a state.<br />
<br />
I couldn’t finish this review without talking about the stellar production. With gorgeous still shots, clever directing and framing choices, and fights that may very well be some of the best animated of the year, Studio WiT adorned this story with some of the most breathtaking visuals.<br />
 <br />
Of course, as with many other pristine-looking shows, detractors who pay little attention to everything being presented above will try making arguments along the lines of “style and no substance”, or try picking convoluted CinemaSins-level plot holes (easily explained away by a second watch). I’ve even witnessed odd attempts to conflate VIVY’s world with Asimov’s laws of robotics for his own fiction, or claims that Vivy is dull as a protagonist due to the anime not slapping you in the face with her development and quirks as most others in the medium do. I pray that you do not form preconceptions based on such comments – although there is a small caveat to the show that I must point out. The show is hindered by its 13-episode limit; while it manages to flesh out its ideas well in every arc, sometimes there is little breathing room left for the viewer. Had this been a 2-cour show, with slightly longer arcs, I believe its emotional peaks would’ve hit even harder – perhaps enough for me to elevate it to the 10/10 it probably deserves.<br />
 <br />
VIVY is a show that, without a doubt, benefits most from rewatches. Whether it is spotting details initially missed, recontextualizations, or simply understanding the (quite hefty) story better, I couldn’t recommend it enough. In fact, I would recommend the English dub after watching the original, as I am more than satisfied with the performances in both languages, although some slightly different characterization may be spotted in the dub. I wouldn’t recommend VIVY: Fluorite Eye’s Song to those looking for an easy watch, as its writing style demands more than casual attention; however, if you are willing to invest yourself into this science fiction epic, you will be more than rewarded for it.<br />

    What a disappointment! I was really looking forward to this one; still can&#039;t believe how quickly it fell apart. Great animation and choreography, great music and sound design, but the story is paper-thin. The premise was very promising, but they just had to rush all the subplots into 1 or 2 episodes each, effectively losing long-term audience involvement and any sort of meaningful world-building. Instead of building characters and stories you would actually get attached to, they resort to cheap emotional payoffs which don&#039;t really affect you all that much. Fans of the cyberpunk, AI future type of shows may still enjoy the show purely

    The art of the anime original has somewhat died out in recent years with studios instead opting to make a quick buck with popular manga and LN adapdations. These are usually more profitable and less risky since they have an established fanbase. Solid anime originals have become far and few between. Luckily, WIT have delivered one of the best I’ve ever seen with Vivy. <br />
<br />
When Vivy was announced, I was cautiously optimistic due to Tappei sensei’s last work, Sigururi. Whilst I personally enjoyed Sigururi, it definitely didn’t live up to the expectations of many considering the staff involved in that project. Vivy on the other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403216">
        hand. completely surpassed any expectations I had. From the very first episode we’re thrown into the chaos of a world being engulfed in an AI uprising. People being shot, buildings burning, explosions, etc. We’re then quickly introduced to our premise, preventing a catastrophic uprising by AIs against human via time travel. From the first episode, I was blown away by the amazing art, character designs, OST and action sequences. Vivy has some of the hypest moments of the year so far. While the promo material and PVs may make it seem like some cutesy idol show, it is anything but. This is a show that asks the very fundamental question of “what does it mean to be human” and is a beautiful journey of self-discovery.<br />
<br />
What Vivy gets right that many other originals fail at is its pacing. It does a great job of not giving everything away at once, but also not being too slow. The anime is directed in such a way that episodes go by in what seems like a few minutes and you’re constantly left with questions at the end of episodes that you want to have answered. As with all time travel fantasies, there’s a couple of inconsistencies, but for the most part the story is extremely well written and brings that signature Tappei feeling of anxiety and dread. Hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst. If you’ve seen or read Re:Zero, you know what I mean.<br />
<br />
One of the most surprising aspects of Vivy for me, was how well choreographed the fight scenes are. WIT did an amazing job with the animation and direction during those sequences and honestly deserved way more praise than they got. In general, Vivy was criminally slept on this season, and it’s a shame. WIT also put together a really good OST that heightened the weight of certain moments. <br />
<br />
Vivy is not just one of the best anime of the season and year, it’s one of the best anime originals out there and I can not recommend it enough. I’ve tried pushing this agenda for the entirety of the season to get people on this show and it’s gradually worked as I see the numbers have gone up. But still, so many people have missed out on this great work. Don’t be one of them.<br />
<br />
Vivy gets 10 microphones out of 10.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
What can we do to save humanity?<br />
-just sing a trash song in every episode and cry<br />
<br />
<br />
Vivy is one of stories where only the idea is actually interesting while the execution is bad as a trash OVA from the 80s. Faced with a season of interesting shows, I decided to watch the new &quot;popular anime&quot; to have some fun and in return I got a bad written story, empty characters, purposeless action scenes, artificial dramas and dialogues that don&#039;t contribute to any concept or discussion that could be interesting in the story. Before I start the review I want to told you I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403234">
        will be using some animes as examples of comparison, mainly To You Eternity, Ghost in The Shell Stand Alone Complex, Eve no Jikan, Megalo Box Nomad and Pluto (manga). As you can see, I will be putting a lot of negative connotation here but there will be no major spoilers about these animes mentioned that will spoil your experience, they will just be quotes.<br />
<br />
Let me start with the story, it is remarkable that many animefans are interested in time travel stories, after all they are plots that have the characterization of persons facing an important event and see their attempts and failures during their journey is what makes it interesting, but when the Vivy script presents consequences or failures? What kind of external or internal consequence resulted in the world? Nothing of this is explored, the anime just skip what should be essential in a story of time travel and summarize to audience in the dumbest way: only a new AI update appeared, I&#039;m persisting in this part because this anime insists on presenting politics about an advanced world, but every line of text ends up being useless, after all that matters in the anime is only what people will do with Vivy, this on the other hand makes the worldbuilding of the story awful, the episodic narrative choices between years only bring distance between characters and their building.<br />
<br />
Vivy&#039;s whole script is dumb, her first mission was to save a minister that would cause a law for AIs, but at the end of the episode, we find out that the death and life of this character don&#039;t cause anything and that the law was made by someone else, so what is the purpose of the whole plot? Does the episode by any chance humanize him? No, the only thing we have is this character quoting the most cliché text of a children&#039;s story (all the characters in Vivy have names and functions in the story, because if we remove these two aspects they don&#039;t stand up because they lack personality) as if it were a theme of the episode when in fact the episode itself doesn&#039;t address any of this, making its characterization artificial and we still find plot holes as: if the solution is to make people avoid a war against AIs, shouldn&#039;t we just make Vivy kill the minister? Because doing this the news would go public, everyone would be afraid of what an AI could do having the human rights being, besides creating a scenario where the same minister dying for what he defended, proving this whole idea would cause this kind of effect in society and show its flaws, doing this the people would rethink this perspective, This I&#039;m don&#039;t understand, Vivy points a simple problem but doesn&#039;t decide to solve it in the simplest way, besides another plot hole, with the death of the minister in the real story, half of the country was makes a homage in public, but a plane crash that killed about +400 passengers, nobody says anything, in fact there is no consequence in the story.<br />

I will be honest, Vivy&#039;s cast is garbage, not because of mediocre characterizations (maybe a little) but they are moved for the plot instead of being themselves and many times they have no screen time to be built up, I will give you an example: remember Estella? A character who exactly has 2 episodes to her arc and in general we have 6 minutes about herself putting all the episodes together, now you may ask me: the remaining time is filled with other characters interactions right? No, just empty action scenes, excessive information about AIs, mission prototype... And nothing about this character, her screen time is also so short because Vivy&#039;s plot doesn&#039;t know how to build two perspectives of the story and makes the building of her drama one of the biggest dogshit I have ever seen. I ask myself, are there any characters in this show? For a drama to be effective it needs: introduction, building, core and development, we can attribute that several characters arise through this structure, it is common that even animes of this season present this, as To Your Eternity brings long arcs for their characters, now what Vivy shows: introduction and ending, the trash way to build a drama, in fact no matter how beautiful is the final, if the plot hasen&#039;t execution or considerable screen time, the script collaborates only for Vivy to get spotlight because she is the heroine of the show, making any backstory without impact and without construction.<br />
<br />
When I finished watching this arc I felt idiot, an idiot for investing time in something that fails even the common narrative, to make matters worse even animes of this season has done this better: look at Gugu from To Your Eternity, having a introduction, where the protagonist of the story doesn&#039;t need to overshadow all the screen time, an introduction lasts about half the episode and even when the protagonist appears we have a new perspective throughout the episode, as part of his character building and about his desires for the future, episodes later we see the first conflict between characters where the character building extends until we have an solid character, the end of episode 8 together with episode 9 form the core that was needed for the story, a solid character and in future episodes we will have his finalization as a character, having new desires and maturing as a person and finally building his final drama, now tell me, between Vivy and To Your Eternity, which one of them managed to follow the line of narrative structure that a drama story needs? I don&#039;t even think I need to answer that.<br />
<br />
The story doesn&#039;t understand what is necessary to build characters so little to build a good drama, some may say to me: &quot;TYE is a predictable drama&quot;, yes it indeed is but at least it tries to build characters, giving screen time for things to be effective and building an organic story, Vivy does not provide that and some say Vivy is not predictable, when we even know what kind of characters we will encounter as obstacles and those who will have dramatic focus during the episode, Vivy is a bad show with a failed episodic structure and as bad story overall. I have to say how bad this anime is at addressing transhumanism, if the first arc has the theme, the anime dind&#039;t touch the theme, don&#039;t show examples and context, there isn&#039;t even discussion between the laws of robotics which are the basic theme that an sci-fi story focused on transhumanism would be able to worldbuilding, the screen time the story spends with an annoying bear spitting missions information, they could at least try to contextualize this theme with other events, for a story that was inspired by Eve no Jikan, they couldn&#039;t learn anything in the end, even an ONE EPISODE of Stand Alone Complex can introduce the theme in a decent way, a single episode does than an arc, it&#039;s a shame how bad Vivy story is, I wonder what kind of entertainment i can see in a story that besides being flawed it manages to be empty, I&#039;m wondering why this anime is top100 and even &quot;top5&quot; of the season.<br />
<br />
Even the future arcs aren&#039;t that good, I feel like the anime got even worse after episode 4, all of Vivy&#039;s action scenes only exist to please the viewer, instead of being cohesive to the story, it&#039;s like a generic action movie who makes your parents watch when there&#039;s nothing to do, where everything could be solved in dialogue, but the plot needs to action scenes all the time to be an fanservice, the moment you can notice action without context, you will notice how poor the script is that needs this kind of trope to continue the story, instead of following a mature way where the action scene will be needed when needed, things that even Megalo Box Nomad this season does excellently, showing how much the writer has matured in his ideas and decided to give prominence to other types of conflicts.<br />
<br />
Now talking about the third arc that can&#039;t decide in being a drama about the robots or the &quot;forbidden&quot; couple of the episode, I need to reiterate how garbage this arc is, a man is chased for terrorists that want to kill him, Vivy ends up with all of them and the first reaction that this kind of character makes is accept them in his car, without at least questioning the purpose of them being there, this is not only bad but shows that all the characters follow a fucking script instead of having their own reactions in the story, remember what I said about the characters acting only for the plot and not for themselves? It is exactly this example here that makes every interaction of Vivy artificial, it&#039;s hard build human characters in this universe? Not even short episodes is an justification, we can see Odd Taxi from the same season, having 13 episodes and yet it has organic interactions between other characters, this is just example that Vivy story is bad written. The fact that the &quot;villain&quot; is a retard also makes a retard script, every time he did any mission Vivy was there to stop him, now if he knows she is just an obstacle why the hell doesn&#039;t decide to go after her himself to finally complete his goals? This not only makes the script dumb but also the story ignoring the butterfly effect for the third time or ignoring something more interesting to the story than the same prototype missions, the plot twist of the arc is dogshit, no make sense that scientist have love feelings to his beloved AI in the first place, they had little contact together and yet they are in love? Crap plot again, It makes no sense that this AI knows what love is when she never had an affective relationship this way, the AI of Vivy makes no sense when you think about it, the AI only acts because the script wants, if the reason is Grace taken care of him since he was child it would also not be convincing because the anime has made it offscreen, seriously I wish to understood why this anime ignores character building.<br />
<br />
the fourth story arc wants to give focus to a mediocre AI melodrama that it only decides to focus on that in the last episode, making 80% of the beginning of the arc focusing on Vivy, destroying a new character oh boy, the new plot doesn&#039;t lead anywhere, seriously, 16 minutes just telling this new life of Vivy, that doesn&#039;t attribute any quality to the story, while the new character of the arc is left aside, remember how To You Eternity shows an entire episode just to introduce new characters, Vivy is the most flawed melodrama I have seen in years and again her action scenes are an excuse to avoid an episode of construction.<br />
<br />
But the problem of the arc doesn&#039;t stop here, the problem is the story fails to humanize AIs, remember that the all past of Ophelia in 1 minute of duration and it doesn&#039;t demonstrate her relationship with Antonio in a convincing way, to make matters worse, the plot twist of the arc (Antonio) is stupid, Antonio wants to prevent the suicide making the scenario even worse causing a double suicide but the anime doesn&#039;t give time to breathe and introduces the most retarded plot twist: that Ophelia who used to be Antonio is now Kakitani, for god&#039;s sake if you are going to make a revelation just FUCKING build it, it&#039;s just a information coming out of nowhere because the writer thought this would be &quot;big brain&quot;, nothing in Vivy is organic, again: if Kakitani has so much power to hacking and predict what Vivy and Matsumoto will do in future events why didn&#039;t he decide to end this shit before those events happen, that would be a surprise for Matsumoto as a challenge and would bring an intelligent character, but nah just build a shitting villain overall, the plot fails to mature through arcs even though we know this is a fucking time travel story, the fight animation in episode 9 is pretty, I admit but all that fighting would have no reason to happen, again the excuse to put displaced action in the episode, the story could spend all this time developing the character through dialogues, if the solution to stop this AI was just Matsumoto infiltrating him, he could have avoided this kind of thing since they met, there is no character exploration in 4 arcs of the anime, occupying 9 episodes in total, we are approaching the end and this anime still didn&#039;t do the basics for a melodrama story.<br />
<br />
After the fight of episode the anime focuses on a superficial drama, without any execution to impact, giving only 10 seconds of flashback for the characters, now I ask everyone who watched this anime: is there any good character in this arc? I&#039;m really searching until now but I only find AIs that have the same cute wife characteristics without any nuance. And that&#039;s another problem, Vivy&#039;s characters don&#039;t bring anything new, even after finishing an arc, I know we will have a character that will be similar to the previous one, with Kakitani being the villain this time and only few moments of interactions between the characters, do you know Pluto? It is a story about how androids and humans can coexist in the world with a mystery in the background, in only 1 volume, Pluto provided several characters that are androids but have different personalities and character building that is divided over several chapters, only 1 volume that could be summarized in 2-3 episodes managed the feat of characterizing and humanizing androids, again: is it too hard to build characters in the show?<br />
<br />
Every arc needs to end in a song just to a weak thrill about &quot;the power of music&quot; to hook the viewer because the story doesn&#039;t offer interesting resources for this, the fact that the episode dedicates 5 minutes for Vivy&#039;s presentation as a farewell hasen&#039;t impact because we met a &quot;new Vivy&quot; recently and now we are moving to another stage quickly, besides another plot hole: How is an AI could create a second personality? The new Vivy (who was not the real Vivy from the first arcs) in the context of the arc is called Diva, created another personality because she was traumatized to learn about her old missions, Diva herself created a personality, what is the point of that? It doesn&#039;t exist because this is not a planned script, the anime ignores the important details and prefers to let the story take its course with just &quot;a song&quot; like a parody anime.<br />
<br />
Now the final arc begins, the first episode was ok, I think is the best episode of the anime so far because it actually knew how to create a core-dramatic and show interesting interactions, unfortunately this episode is there to remind you that this whole story could be better, episode 11 doesn&#039;t answer anything new presented so far besides the way Osamu inserted the data in Vivy, no interesting character interaction even the story presented several ways for this, which is no longer something new because this anime is a wasted potential and another plot hole: if all these people including Osamu are researching so much of how to stop this war, how the hell did they not think of the tower, it&#039;s the most obvious possible scenario for the power source but only now it has relevance, it amazes me how pathetic your characters are that they can create ways to transmit knowledge and time travel but to deduce something simple, they don&#039;t think of anything, information only comes up for conflict convenience.<br />
<br />
in episode 12 we have the revelation of the main villain of the story projecting himself as an AI that rebelled against humans and wants to exterminate the race only to become a new race, a generic cliché of supremacist AI where part of his plan would summary in &quot;help humanity to evolve&quot; as the typical empty text to justify the final plot and also comes another mistake in the timeline: if the AIs can marry and &quot;love&quot; in this story, what prevents all the others not to have a similar feeling? I&#039;m mentioning this because this story wants to convince me that Vivy was the only IA to want something of herself, but one decent thing the episode brought is the justification for the &quot;lack of consequences&quot;, I could even understand but even with the explanation another problem arises in the universe: The convenient fact that Matsumoto sleeps for years without at least analyzing how the universe progresses, breaking any challenge of time travel, every action needs to have a consequence, but did he even think of this while talking during all the episodes? What is the point of being an AI that thinks beyond ordinary AIs that knows all the risks and cannot deduce that the universe was not changing, the worldbuilding is garbage.<br />
<br />
Even though the story tries to correct the anime, it gets dumber the longer you think about it, for example: all situations could be ended in other ways (we are talking about a advanced universe in technology) but it is not built in a natural way because the script is based on convenience, those same conveniences that make the characters and universe dumb: why does Vivy have to sing to stop the robots? Why doesn&#039;t Matsumoto become an evil AI like everyone else? We are talking about a queen AI that is smarter than him. Why didn&#039;t they notice on the cameras that there was a countdown to power up again? Why doesn&#039;t Osamu just send Vivy a date from many years ago instead of just at the beginning of the massacre? Besides it being extremely convenient that he is the only one to survive all that, there were 300+ satellites (another stupid thing for the final arc) that fell to earth and he is the only human to survive just to bring a happy ending to the story, I wouldn&#039;t be pushing Vivy so hard if this show didn&#039;t more than the basics in being an ordinary melodrama, much less having been written by two famous authors and managing to have the feat of presenting a completely retarded plot, there are already stories that manage to make all the points he tries much better, whether from this season or before, all the bad points could be avoided but Vivy chose the worst way to follow.<br />
<br />
If the AI villain&#039;s mission was to kill all humans, why didn&#039;t the AI destroy Vivy in the first place? Vivy was the key to the whole scenario, it would be the only way for the plan to be effective, but just for convenience the script needs an intelligent antagonist to be dumb enough to give the empty excuse that &quot;show me your lifestyle&quot;, why didn&#039;t they send all the data to Vivy in the first place? If this story were a movie, I think it would be tolerable, yet the time travel still doesn&#039;t make sense, it simply doesn&#039;t respect the rules of singularity points that make time travel possible, its method has few details, every final sequence made me want to vomit while the anime showed scenes from its previous arcs, Matsumoto arriving in time to stop a satellite by sheer convenience of the script is also one of the things that irritated me in these last minutes, it is so stupid and badly written that only one satellite (of all) decided to fall in the place where Vivy was singing, why the hell the AI villain try to stop Vivy, knowing that her music could give an answer to the most important question, it was this AI that told Vivy directly that singing could avoid disasters, the AI of this show makes absolutely no sense. At the end of the storyline several questions that should have been answered in previous arcs were ignored, after all what were the circumstances of the AI factory being destroyed or even Ophelia&#039;s suicide, summary all in &quot;I&#039;m the AI king and I controlled the events&quot; is too stupid for an explanation. <br />
<br />
<br />
Production: Vivy has good sakugas during climactic episodes and decent background art, the cgi is awful that often gets in the way of the visuals, but of all things I have to say how dead their character design is, all the characters have forgettable designs with trash color contrast, I know there are several detailed shots but they don&#039;t summarize all the episodes, they are such vague shots that have no significance it is just pure beauty without context to actually have, maybe I&#039;m exaggerating but by WIT&#039;s standards this is by far the worst design they brought, every time I see the characters I just think of those trash idols anime that try to be popular every year but fail for don&#039;t show an interesting design or even a poorly hentai, being a popular anime of the season, now follow my example: BNA, ID:Invaded, Appare-Ranman! , Great Pretender, Deca-Dence, Akudama Drive, Wonder Egg Priority, SK∞... Now look at Vivy, did you notice how forgettable and dead her look is? All the anime mentioned here was popular of their own seasons anime and overall they had interesting characters designs, looks how each the mc was a character from that show, an character design is something that matters as it can tell us about what makes a cast memorable, look at Dorohedoro as an example or  Zombieland Saga, an anime about idols has unique designs, You can argue with me that because it&#039;s a story about the discovery of human feelings coming from an artificial being the design was thought out like that, but then we just have to look at Violet Evergarden and all this argument hasen&#039;t credibility. <br />
<br />
I decided don&#039;t comment about the eighth attempt at wanting to make the viewer emotional about irrelevant character dying, so I&#039;ll just give my final quotes, still it&#039;s hard to sympathize with Vivy&#039;s AIs when in the end they are made up to be killing machines who have &quot;suffered&quot;, a lazy way of building an character. Anyway, the text got longer than I thought, it&#039;s over right? Yes, it&#039;s over, I could mention other criticisms but I think I&#039;ve already said why this show is bad written, flawed in drama, have bad characters and a awful universe, if you want a interesting anime about time travel, watch Link Click, if you want a mature story divided into character arcs watch Megalo Box Nomad, an action sci-fi but with an interesting universe:  Stand Alone Complex, human dramas divided into arcs: To You Eternity, a humanization between android and humans: Pluto (manga), a short anime but with good characters being build in every episode: Odd Taxi and finally about transhumanism in practice: Eve no Jikan, you have several choices here that can please you in different ways and that know how to make use of the essentials to tell a good story.<br />
<br />
Watch Odd Taxi, is the hidden gem of the season.

    I feel weird walking away from this show with such a positive opinion of it, because if it wasn’t so unbelievably gorgeous, I honestly think I would’ve dropped it very early on. <br />
<br />
Maybe this is just me, but even at its most competent and interesting points, I don’t think I ever really bought in to the premise of Vivy at all. Vivy is a show about our cute, autistic, android waifu who goes back in time to stop her fellow androids from genociding the human race, which she can do because she’s Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Terminator and has a talking teddy bear robot sidekick who knows

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403201">
        literally everything and can accomplish literally anything as long as he can plug himself into it. And while I promise you I want to sit here talking about time travel even less than you want to read about it, let me just say that out of the several dozens of scientifically, relativistically viable real-world theories about how time travel could or should be possible, not a single one functions similar to the way it does in Vivy. Oh, and did I forget to mention Vivy is also an idol? And the androids’ AI programming relies on evolution to improve itself? And Vivy actually has an alternate timeline personality called Diva which supplants her shyness with pure Chad energy? Yeah, this is a very silly story, with very silly concepts, and an understanding of its own scientific foundations which is thin enough to make you question how seriously it even wants you to take it, but a premise is still a premise, and if you can accept such a premise, I wouldn’t characterize Vivy as a broken or particularly illogical story. It follows its own rules and never undermines its own script, and even if someone like me finds it a bit hard to swallow, you shouldn’t let anyone get away with calling it downright bad. While I would never claim it isn’t inspired by better, more memorable works, this show is nothing if not an original standout amongst the usual seasonal shlock.<br />
<br />
Vivy is easily one of the more competently co-written anime I’ve ever seen, and I think it’s because both writers knew why they specifically were brought onto the project. Eiji Umehara is a well-established sci-fi writer who has written for works as classic and prestigious as Masamune Shirow adaptations and even more modern sci-fi collaborations with 5pb visual novels, and his expertise in the field really comes through. As much as I might make fun of the distinct campiness of the show’s genre juggling, the actual realization of its ideas is quite thorough and interesting. From the gravitational physics of a rocket launch and atmospheric reentry to the structural interworkings of androids with exposed innards, so many of the action set-pieces and unique artistic elements in this visual spectacle of an anime heavily rely on intricate knowledge of actual technology. Now, you may be wondering, then where does Tappei Nagatsuki chime in? Well, if you’ve suffered through Re:Zero, you’ve probably already guessed. Whether it be the show’s sophomoric political dimension, its pseudoscientific plot devices, or its characters’ juvenile emotions, EVERYTHING is explained and expounded in torturous, tedious detail, leaving no room for inference or nuance, assuming it had any to begin with. And unlike my smaller complaints thus far, I don’t really have any way or even any desire to excuse this subpar writing. It just dilutes the show and gives the whole thing an air of immaturity and amateurishness. Even the themes of AI vs humanity which the show tackles are seriously cookie cutter stuff, and the sci-fi not being hardcore enough for true fans of the genre aside, this is the one true and tangible problem with Vivy.<br />
<br />
But who even cares about any of that—this show is drop dead gorgeous. Aesthetically, it is quite typical, but as one should’ve long since come to expect from the powerhouse, WIT Studio, it has double the frames, triple the artistic acuteness, quadruple the post-production detail, and quintuple the cinematic ambition of all its contemporaries. Shinpei Ezaki is a director who I’ve always seen as simply trying to rip-off Tetsuro Araki, and this is no surprise given how closely he’s worked with that legendary man over the course of his own relatively short creative career, and while Vivy doesn’t really stray from this formula in any capacity I can notice, I don’t mean this to be an insult at all. Vivy, despite its sci-fi posturing, is most definitely an adorable waifu action show first and foremost whether it likes it or not, and despite Nagatsuki dumping exposition on a whim, the pace of this show is lightning fast, and its number-one priorities are aways beautiful artwork and pretty colors, wildly ambitious and badass action choreography, and gorgeous futuristic locations which aren’t over-designed messes. Vivy and her teddy bear who’s name I forgot to mention was Matsumoto are both charming and lovable in their own way, and they’re nowhere near the obnoxious teenagers of Re:Zero or, for that matter, Senyoku no Sigrdrifa. The side characters are solid as well, and the arc-to-arc structure of the show really works magic when it comes to the arrangement of frequent and increasingly extravagant climaxes to each self-contained story. From a narrative standpoint, I think anyone would agree the ending is more hokey than the rest, but the animation production behind it all is never any less magnificent than it ever was at any point.<br />
<br />
Vivy: Fluorite Eye’s Song is absolutely delicious, delectable popcorn entertainment I would recommend to just about anyone. Regardless of the fact it’s somewhat silly here in the real world, it’s sensical and thoughtful in-universe and, either way, always places its fantastic action and likable characters above its sci-fi elements which one may find more than a little fast and loose. Even picky eaters such as myself will be hard-pressed sticking their noses up at such a laudable and incredible production, and I have no doubt WIT Studio will continue to grace us with their daring and outstanding original productions for as long as time and money will allow. This is an epic which follows Vivy throughout the course of a hundred years to stop evil and save the world, and if it wasn’t for production companies like the ones funding and crafting it, we in the community would be waiting about that long for one such beauty to air. Despite her grand destiny, Vivy’s personal wish is simply to make everyone happy with her singing, and I think that childish innocence and simplicity echoes through the heart of every element of the show, which, despite its scientific and technical decorations, just wants to be entertaining, fun, and staggeringly beautiful. If you ever wandered what a Hollywood action film would be like if it had actually likable and well-rounded characters, actually interesting concepts and innovative ideas, actual theming and some level of deeper meaning to make it at all worthwhile, and actually competent and artful cinematic direction which is more than just a thoughtless vehicle for over-the-top visual action, then look no further than Vivy: Fluorite Eye’s Song. With proper expectations, it will not disappoint. <br />

    Episode 6 Is the Turning Point of the Entire Series - An Interim Review<br />
<br />
(May contain story spoilers from Episode 6)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The perennial question continues: what does it mean to pour your heart into something?<br />
<br />
Episode 6, as the numerical halfway point of the series, serves as a pivotal turning point for both the audience and Vivy. The commentary below will mainly focus on how symbolism is used to portray this change in tone.<br />
<br />
Two sacrifices were made during the process of terminating Metal Float in this episode. While the most groundbreaking one regards Dr. Saeki – which we will discuss momentarily – the first sacrifice actually revolves around

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395882">
        M205. When asked by Vivy “what it means to pour one’s heart into something,” M205 responded in a way seemingly indicative of that it holds no capacity for independent thought aside from fulfilling its prefixed mission. However, when Vivy injected the serum into M205, the viewer was shown an ephemeral scene of M205’s mind – a future where M205 happily interacts with children and being proud of his nickname, “M.” Although still mindful of its mission, M205 was nevertheless able to develop its own dreams and aspirations.<br />
<br />
Vivy’s actions, however, strangled the possibilities for M205&#039;s dream to ever become reality, sacrificing its consciousness to shut down the Metal Float. She exhibits grief for M205’s fate but was able to overcome it and continue with her own mission. Perhaps it was because her mission is to destroy AI to prevent human death, and that she considered M205’s death an inevitability along this process.<br />
<br />
The second sacrifice, however, erupts much more chaos. This, of course, regards the actions and eventual death of Dr. Saeki. When Vivy finds herself lost at the central tower, Dr. Saeki chooses to lead her to Grace’s core. With the lifeless body of K5 lying beside him, Saeki realizes that his fight has come to an end: Grace cannot be recovered, and the remnant of his love will forever be no more. Vivy, however, still has a future ahead of her. What motivates Dr. Saeki is a sense of sympathy and abandonment; by showing Vivy the way, he admits his downfall and, in a certain sense, passes his longings and responsibilities onto Vivy – the AI who is destined to destroy all AI.<br />
<br />
The ramifications of this sacrifice, however, arrive during the ending scenes of the episode. Just like the cardinal principle of AI, when Dr. Saeki’s only goal is demolished, his life is ended with his downfall. When he killed himself next to the unworn wedding ring, human blood spills all over Vivy, leading to the scene in which one of her hands is covered with blue fluids from Grace, the other with red blood from Dr. Saeki. This juxtaposition of color can be interpreted to portray several messages, but the one that establishes Episode 6 as the turning point of the entire series is the point of Conflict in Vivy’s identity.<br />
<br />
As she stated herself before, Diva is the AI who aims to bring people happiness through her songs, while Vivy is the AI who aims to destroy all AI to prevent slaughter. Although these two identities entail vastly different responsibilities, they are united by their central goal, which is to save humans; this conjunction has been the core that kept Vivy operating under both identities. Dr. Saeki’s death, however, disrupted this protocol on a fundamental level: by terminating Grace, Vivy has indirectly caused Dr. Saeki to take his own life. The ocean of artificial fluids Vivy treads on has now been mixed with human blood. In such a world where AI and humans have developed a complex relationship of dependence and emotional attachment, destroying AI would also sever a part of humanity as a sacrifice. The manifestation of this conflict can be seen when Vivy’s power signal began to flicker between blue and red at the end, indicating that the coexistence between “Diva” and “Vivy” is ultimately conflicting – and that her 100-year mission would involve much more than destroying artificial fabrications.<br />
<br />
To the viewer, Episode 6 is a reminder that the macroenvironmental setting is quickly changing with every passing episode. As years go by, the perspectives humans hold on AI and themselves evolve as well. As change is the only constant, Episode 6 encourages the viewer to remain vigilant about Vivy’s change in principles and behaviors, providing one the eagerness to discover how Vivy will cope with her conflicting missions and interact with allies and opponents alike.<br />
<br />
With the thoughtful infusion of symbolism in characters like M205 and objects such as the mixture of blood and artificial fluid, Episode 6 is to be remembered as both the literal and the symbolic turning point of Vivy: Flourite Eye’s Song.<br />

    Warning: update, vauge spoilers and I hate this show. It went from okay to bad with the Ophelia arch ruining any semblance of momentum this show had going for it. Vivy took a solid concept and squandered its potential at every turn.<br />
<br />
Vivy is mostly gratuitous violence for the sake of violence, or shock, but due to the over saturation of violence in the show I&#039;d argue the shock leaves after the first three minutes of episode 1. After episode 3 I was tired of it, at episode 13 I actively loathed it. I do not feel anything for characters as they come or go, because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397286">
        this is told via the perspective of an ai who doesn&#039;t understand human emotion, and therefore what little we get of these characters is so achingly dull. These characters do not exist as people, they exist as plot devices, and their execution just feels lazy. Literally the final episode scrambled to find a character with any emotional foothold to Vivy, and so they bring back characters from episode 1, because despite fighting for humanity, Vivy doesn&#039;t actually know many humans.<br />
<br />
Diva does not have any autonomy in this series to the point it is maddening. Every two or three episodes her character feels like a new person with new goals that were spun up by the people making decisions around her. Which, again, aren&#039;t characters but instead are written with the sole intent to further the overarching plot. With no &quot;down&quot; time, we don&#039;t get the chance to see vivy process things on her own or interact with the world at large, and the small sliver we see of a character that thinks and feels on her own is literally just a narrative foil to vivy (who is diva? Who is not diva). She is existing for her mission, which the show doesn&#039;t really take great care in making narratively important, and her character is the same person in episode 1 that she is in episode 13.  Any chance at growth is ruined by the need to stick to this plot, explain the large leaps in time (horrible as there is no grounding in the world for the audience) and once again, violence!!<br />
<br />
Had this show simplified itself, or let its viewer think, or explore the world beyond the mc, or introduced any importance beyond the mc with no agency and simply is a vehicle for which the plot is told, this show would be okay! Vivy is a lesson in don&#039;t bite off more than you can chew or high budget doesn&#039;t disguise bad writing.<br />
<br />
OG review (6/10): I don&#039;t write reviews often, but as my opinion is so against the grain of the high rating, I figured now was a good time to crack my knuckles and get to typing.<br />
<br />
I think this show is good and an okay way to kill some time on a Sunday afternoon. It isn&#039;t great, but it isn&#039;t terrible either. In a stronger season, I think this show would not have received the amount of attention it currently has and would have a lower rating overall. A lot of what surrounds Vivy right now is the allure of an anime original with high production value. I will give Vivy credit where credit is due - visually this show is the best of the season. The watercolor animated scenes are breathtaking and tight action scenes are fantastic to watch on top of nicely designed characters. However, you peel the shiny sticker off a little bit and you find a show that lacks substance. <br />
<br />
Vivy is a sci-fi show that has been stripped of the nuance of the genre. It fails to make better (or even live up to) the genre that proceeds it, and in its lack of punch, it doesn&#039;t end up saying anything at all. Sure, not everything has to be thought provoking, but in a show where it positions itself in an incredibly layered way, those layers are paper thin. This show feels like it wrote down a bunch of things it has seen in other anime that are deep and just shoved them into their show unedited. I don&#039;t know what emotion it wants me to feel half the time, they don&#039;t bother explaining anything in any meaningful way and most of the time I am just waiting for unnecessary fight scenes to be over.<br />
<br />
Maybe at some point in the final half of this show I will make a decision on whether the story is good or bad, but right now it just is. The only really thought provoking thing this show has managed to achieve is likely unintentional - why is everything in this show solved by violence at the hands of Hatsune Miku.

    This series nearly went under my radar at the start of the season, but I am glad I noticed it. An original by WIT, an excellent VA cast, and a well known director, its rather amazing that this series had so little hype leading up to it. Vivy ended up being a rather excellent sci fi series and this review will highlight the various aspects of the series that were excellently executed along with a few things the series struggled with. <br />

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
<br />
In a world where AI will eventually wage a genocidal war against mankind, a scientist decides that they will prevent

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403202">
        this disastrous future by sending an advanced AI back in time to guide an idol robot into stopping the development of hyper advanced AI. The plot does sound a bit ridiculous based on the former description, however its also fairly unique for an anime premise, yes it has been done to death in western movies however its still fairly rare to see time travel AI plots in anime. As for execution, Vivy is well done for the most part, there was a decent amount of apprehension given the complexity of properly executing time travel stories and this being an original anime however the story was generally executed with competence. From the introduction of the 2 AI characters, to the development of the changing world over the time period the series takes place in, and the overall strength of the cast, the series manages to tell a very immersive science fiction story. There are some very sad moments that are handled with care and delivered with impact, the show does not shy away from killing additions to the cast but handles it in a way that the characters are decently built up before their deaths to make it all the more effective for impacting the viewer. There are also some hard to watch moments involving an AI making conflicting decisions, such as choosing between saving people they have gotten close to during their life or sacrificing them in hopes they can prevent a much greater tragedy in the future.<br />
<br />
As for the single best aspect of the story, it was how the time travel element was handled, specifically when it is explained who set the singularity project in motion and how their interactions with Vivy shaped them and lead them to choosing her as one of the 2 people leading the mission. It is very easy to mess up time travelling in anime, so it was great to see an excellent twist with a very well thought out and developed delivery, the scientist background episode was actually one of the most emotional episodes of anime I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
The series, despite the earlier strong points mentioned, does lack a few notable things. First the antagonists of the story are generally sort of idiotic and hard to take seriously. Terrorists who oppose technological advancement, yet with each of their moves they simply strengthen the odds that hyper advanced AI will come about eventually and that they will not be friendly to humans. The AI themselves are not really the antagonists but victims who are manipulated, which hurts the fact that during the series Vivy is developed as a fairly human like character, one with troubles expressing herself, but human acting none the less. By reducing the AI to unthinking victims who had no part to play in the genocidal war in the future, the show ended up weakening the whole premise of intelligent AI coexisting as servants to humans, even though this was one of the better themes in the series. Some other aspects of the show that hurt it are that the time skips are not very impactful, time passes very quickly in the anime, yet the audience needs to pay a lot of attention to notice that decades have passed, the scenery in the primary location barely changes, with only the AI control tower growing larger. These flaws do hurt the story and keep it from being perfect, but its still a very good story and one that is definitely worth watching if you enjoy sci fi series.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
<br />
The artwork is far above average, as expected of WIT studio the series looks absolutely gorgeous in every scene. From the beautiful movie quality rain animation to the fluid fight scenes, including some of the most expression facial animations, and stunning character designs, this series has some of the best artwork in the current season and possibly some of the best this year. <br />
<br />
We are introduced to the show with a dreamlike atmosphere in an amusement park, rapidly things descend to chaos as a massacre occurs, the way the park is designed contrasted with the violence that occurs really exemplifies how horrific the machine uprising was and why all steps were necessary to prevent it. The use of beautiful scenery and backgrounds, contrasted with the dark side of the actions taken on by AI throughout the show and the general graphicness of the underlying story, really paint an exceptional picture of struggle. Struggle to maintain this pristine and perfect world despite all the terrible things occurring in the background, the pristine and pretty world may be considered fake to some extent, however the people living in it find it to be very real as does the audience due to how captivating it is. This contrast is incredibly well played, although present in many other series, its exceptionally well executed in Vivy due to the incredible details put into the world and the way the art despite the heavy contrast does not clash between the beautiful world and the terrible events that occur. Both the Opening and the ED further take this point home and really go above and beyond in how well the contrasting imagery is executed while they play out, it really gives the audience a taste of what to expect and the show afterwards even exceeds the high expectations set out by the starting sequence.<br />
<br />
The character designs are all really well done as well, the characters look very human and the AI characters are differentiated from humans in slight ways that do not seem jarring and help the audience understand how the AI managed to be integrated into society so well despite being quite different from humans in status and behavior. Vivy especially has an exceptionally aesthetic look, from her perfect lips, pretty blue hair and striking eyes to her perfect shiny pale exterior and every outfit she wears exemplifying how cute she is, Vivy definitely feels like a robot Violet Evergarden. Its worth adding that the other sophisticated AI, especially the girls, are all very well designed and look astonishingly attractive, if you are interested in robot girls this show will definitely appeal to your tastes. Given that Vivy’s Song is a performance based anime at its heart, and Vivy is a performer AI, it would stand to reason that the performances she puts on should be the most well choregraphed and animated instances of the show. The show definitely lives up to expectations and delivers to us very lively solo performances from Vivy, performances that entertain, performances that impact and performances that move the audience, Vivy easily captivates hearts with her performances and continuously improves throughout the series.<br />
<br />
Some other aspects to note are that the fight scenes are very well animated, even individual shots are top quality and the show does not take its combat scenes lightly, from intelligent choreography and camera work to excellently impactful combat and environmental effects, the fights are definitely executed with both competence and style. There are some drawbacks to the combat scenes, in that they could probably have been extended and most of them skipped a good portion of the action just to focus on highlight moments between Vivy and the terrorists, but its still quite entertaining to watch and exceeded expectations given the type of anime this was supposed to be. In addition, the scenes where Vivy is in her inner mind are delivered in a way that really captures her feeling and anxieties, the subtle changes in her mental room as the show goes on is nice to watch and makes sure to keep the audience on the same track as where Vivy is headed. Another aspect, the facial animations, are almost perfect, there is no laziness taken in this series, where other anime may blank out character faces when in a distance or avoid animating eye movement or lips consistently, Vivy’s Song takes no shortcuts and makes the entire cast look like they are alive.<br />
<br />
The sound: 9<br />
<br />
As expected, given that it is a show about a singing robot, the music was one area where the series did not fail at. Every single performance was filled with a catchy lit song, excellent dance choreography, astounding visuals and of course a great conclusion. Vivy, regardless of the audience she gets, always puts on the best performance she can, and the sound quality and performances slowly improving throughout the story really capture how much she has grown. Its not just Vivy performing either, the sister series also put on great performances and even AI that you least expect to perform have moments where they will sing and perform. The performances are always transitioned into well and they always fit the atmosphere and add value to scenes, it does not feel forced at all.<br />
<br />
The opening was incredibly good and is the type of song that you would be willing to put in a playlist, although the ED wasn’t particularly outstanding compared to some other series this season, it was fairly solid as well and closed episodes well, and this season had some ridiculously good Ending songs to compete with.<br />
Other aspects of the soundtrack like the excellent combat sounds, background music and sound effects in general were also handled with care. From the scene where Vivy is in the mental landscape to the space hotel evacuation and the immersive high speed car chases, even the early episodes covered exactly how well the sound brought this series to life. It only gets better after as well, as the sound design continues to exceed expectations and deliver movie quality sound effects and performances for the entirety of the show.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
<br />
The main protagonist, Vivy, has stellar development throughout the series. She begins as an unexpressive doll that performs to entertain guests at a theme part, but over time explores the world and grows very human over time. Her performances captivate audiences and move people, she influences many people with her heroic actions, and despite her mission being to simply perform music, she manages to manipulate her programming to achieves goals she cares about. Vivy having astounding development throughout the story of course could not be achieved without the large cast she interacts with, she meets many people throughout her century long journey, friends, enemies, spectators, and people with their own dreams that may conflict with hers at some points. She grows by familiarizing herself with them, by saving them, by fighting people, by improving her music which allows for reaching a greater audience and through loss which is ever present in this series.<br />
Many characters do die, but they shine brightly for the time they were present in the story, Vivy impacts their life and in turn they impact Vivy and her growth, it does hurt the show a bit they were sacrificed for the plot but it did stop their characters from having an impact. The deaths and the salvation in this series is handled very well and Vivy is grown in a very thoughtful way throughout the show, every interaction adds up and has an effect, its definitely interesting to watch how Vivy takes in the world.<br />
 <br />
The growth of the AI characters on the side, and how human like they are, even when certain AI characters are not designed to look like humans or act in a particularly human way due to not having interaction focused missions, is another highlight of the series. Although it’s been done many times, the execution of the human like AI in the world in this story is handled with a lot of care, there are no poorly paced or rushed moments and its completely believable.<br />
<br />
The reasons why this series only gets an 8 for characters is due to a few things, the first is initially how absolutely insufferable the little AI companion was and the other is due to the antagonists being rather poorly characterized or outright stupid for most of the series and a large number of the AI characters being reduced to victims or sacrificed for the plot despite how well thought out and human like they were. As for the final antagonist, it was fairly predictable who it would be but their reasoning barely made any sense which also kept the score from being any higher.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
<br />
The plot was handled as well as expected and the visuals were near perfect, the amount of effort put into this anime really stands out and is very evident given the unbelievably beautiful frames, the excellent music and exceptional voice acting. It was a pleasure to watch this every week and despite a huge number of shows dropped on the same day during this season, this one stands out the most and above the rest easily. In short, this anime ranks high for enjoyment and is one of the best original anime created, definitely one of WIT studios best work.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
<br />
The story, while done to death in other media, was executed with competence and gained a fresh perspective in anime form. The visuals had next to no flaws, the characters, especially Vivy, had great development and overall, the music was some of the best I have heard in anime. There is nothing notable detracting from the show enough that I feel like a high score is unrealistic and I personally enjoyed it greatly, due to this Vivy will be receiving a 9 out of 10, as a stellar example of how to execute an original sci fi themed anime.<br />

    THIS IS NOT AN IDOL ANIME.<br />
<br />
This is probably the number 1 reason people haven&#039;t checked out this show. It is heavily underrated and you should definitely go watch it now. The only reason I found out about this show was because WIT studio was making it. <br />
<br />
From the art, music, animation, story, character, everything about it is great. It&#039;s almost non-stop action every episode. Music is beautiful and fun to listen to. Characters are very likeable. GOD there&#039;s a lot to like about this show. Even if the story is something people have seen a million times where ai&#039;s take over the world and wipe

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395849">
        humans out and we go back in time to stop it from happening, it makes you wonder if it is going to change anything and each episode perfectly pulls you in to see the outcome. <br />
<br />
Just go watch it, had to make a review so more people can get into this wonderful anime.<br />
