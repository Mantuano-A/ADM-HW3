    Oh Koro-sensei, He wasn&#039;t just teaching his students new things, he taught us fans new things too, even if we didn&#039;t realize it. Among-st the many things Koro-Sensei taught us, was how to laugh, learn &amp; develop, always make room to improve, be inspired, challenge yourself, and most importantly use your full potential! <br />

During the shows first season I was not interested in the anime nor manga. I felt that the story was absolutely ridiculous and a complete  waste of time reading/watching. It wasn&#039;t until 2013 that I saw &quot;Funny moments&quot; or &quot;best moments&quot; in anime videos on Youtube and saw Assassination classroom on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222446">
        it and thought to myself, &quot;ha, this does look pretty funny&quot; &quot;I&#039;ll try any show once&quot;, gave it a watch and was for the most part blown away.. like the moon...  (Puns intended.)My favorite thing about the story and plot is that it connected to me, the viewer on a personal level.  I could relate to how most of the characters backstories in E classroom were treated at school. For the most part, mainly towards the ending of the season 2 I felt that the build up towards the final episode were very well executed... or should I say.. assassinated.. wait, I don&#039;t think that  word works.. whatever. The begining of the season 2  has ups and downs however for the most part, it remains pretty solid. I don&#039;t want to use the term &quot;roller-coaster&quot; but I think I will use that to describe it. For example, 1-4 episodes will be about the daily lives of certain students, or the students working on something unrelated to the story. It felt more like filler episodes for the most part.  Now for the second part season 2 the backstories about certain characters past and the history of class E finally begin to unfold. We are introduced to more characters and both shocking, and sudden plot developments, as to be expected. For the most part each arc of season 2 is all over the place and honesty, I felt it lacked a sensible amount of balance. The plot for certain episodes can feel a bit confusing at times because one second the students are honing their skills then next episode they are helping re-build a shelter. So balance does seem to be a reoccurring problem within the story-line. Overall I l was generally impressed with the story, I believe that Yūsei Matsui did an amazing job with his work and that Lerche did an amazing job following the work.<br />
<br />
Number one thing that annoyed me about the series overall is that  the animation or lighting in Ansatsu Kyoushitsu, even without the show being censored it&#039;s really dark. There are multiple moments in the show where areas are unnecessarily darkened to the point where I actually start questioning myself &quot;This is the uncensored or raw version right?&quot; The background settings looked poorly done so maybe that&#039;s why the animators decided to use darkness in multiple scenes. Character designs still remain the same so I do not have much to add to the subject. I felt like the artwork, especially the background settings needed to be re-done. I hope to see whoever is in charge of editing the Blu-Ray discs, brightens things up.<br />
<br />
The sound wasn&#039;t anything to special, I don&#039;t want to say lackluster however most of the times I&#039;d be watching an action scenes I didn&#039;t feel like the music playing enhanced the situations(s) occurring on screen. I also didn&#039;t care for both opening songs and the latest ending song Mata Kimi ni Aeru Hi by Shion Miyawaki. The ending song from PT 1 was my only favorite track. Seiyuu&#039;s are always amazing in this show. Of course my main man, a hundred grams, N*gga&#039;s just don&#039;t understand, Jun Fukuyama reprises his role as the lovable and somewhat admirable Koro sensei. Perhaps my favorite thing that Jun does with Koro sensei is his laugh. Every time I hear &quot;Nyeh heh heh heh heh&quot; or &quot;Nyu fu fufu fu&quot; I burst out laughing too.  Nagisa, Karma, I really liked that their voice actors went through good lengths of studying English so they could speak it properly for certain episodes. While Karma&#039;s actor Nobuhiko English sounded a bit &quot;broken&quot; I did however like that Nagisa&#039;s voice actor Mai<br />
Fuchigami was able to enunciate or pronounce English better. Everyone else did a great job with their roles and I think that Ansatsu Kyoushi has one of the best cast of voice actors for an anime series. Each of the actors are able to express a good amount of feeling with their characters in order to make their characters feel more... realistic.<br />
<br />
The characters are the most vital part of Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. The main focus for all characters in Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is growth &amp; development. These  two things  are literally the key in what makes this series work out so great. As to be expected of course, during the beginning of the series season 1 until the ending, the characters are lacking strength, potential, and skill. My favorite thing about the series characters is that I felt like I got to experience growth along with the students, and the teachers in this series. The way the characters react  when they learn new things or acquire a new skill, because I felt so involved while watching it made me feel like I learned something new too. For example, if Koro-sensei is speaking directly to the students about studying for an exam and he&#039;s giving them both words of advice and encouragement then I, the viewer am also receiving some sort of acknowledgement too. Another thing about the characters is that they&#039;re all made to be either relate-able and or likable. That way viewers like me feel like they are on the same level as the characters in the show. Out of all departments listed from the &quot;rate the anime&quot; category I would say that characters are my most favorite thing about the series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and pleasure is always experienced while I&#039;m watching Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. I don&#039;t think for a second I&#039;ve ever been truly unsatisfied with an episode. I have to give the series some praise because for 25 episodes and not a single one for me to dislike, I think that&#039;s amazing. I think to myself, even while writing this, &quot;hmmm, I know there has to be at least one episode I hate&quot; but I just cannot think of a single episode. Overall I was very satisfied with Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. I think although it may not have been the best of the current season it still stood out enough to earn the 4th spot in my top 5 airing the spring season. 9/10 for a memorable and joyful experience.

    The sad fact of life is that all good things must eventually come to an end, and that includes whatever school year might have actually been fun for you. Thus, Class 3-E - the only class that teaches assassination - must come to an end, as well, whether the world goes down with it or not. In this season of Assassination Classroom, we get to see how it all ends, making it one of those anime that is actually a full adaptation of the original manga. When I watched the first season last year, I enjoyed it a whole lot; that was more than enough

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222458">
        to get me to watch the second season when it came out. Needless to say, this season was even better.<br />
<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, tentacles all over (yes, I&#039;m saying that again), here is my review of Assassination Classroom Second/Final Season.<br />
<br />
For those unfamiliar with Assassination Classroom, it centers around Class 3-E, which is considered to be the lowest class in Kunugigaoka Junior High (and gets poor treatment from both teachers and students because of it). They end up getting a new teacher, which is a huge, yellow, octopus-like thing capable of Mach 20 speed and, as it is said, mass destruction; you see, he is apparently responsible for the recent destruction of the moon. He claims to be destroying Earth next in a year, but first, he wants to teach Class 3-E. Thus, Class 3-E is given the assignment of killing this thing, now named Koro-sensei, by graduation, and they will earn the 10 billion yen bounty on his head if he does so. Needless to say, Koro-sensei proves to be an excellent teacher to the students by not only teaching them the regular school subjects and assassination, but also life lessons.<br />
<br />
The second season of Assassination Classroom picks up from where it left off, and boy, does it get great from there! A few parts of the story in this season feel a little rushed, but it was certainly never boring! It provided a lot of character development for each character in this series, even some of the ones that started out unlikable. For example, the principal of Kunugigaoka Junior High, Asano, starts off as someone with a heart of stone, but when you get to see his backstory, you start to sympathize with him even a little bit. Speaking of backstories, Koro-sensei&#039;s backstory is finally revealed in this season, as well, and while trying not to give too much away.... man, is it intense!<br />
<br />
The art and animation in season two of AssClass (still amused by this abbreviation) is pretty much the same as in season one, seeing that it&#039;s still Lerche animating it, so there really isn&#039;t much for me to say here. It&#039;s still well-done animation that especially stands out in the easy-to-get-into action scenes. The Japanese voice acting for this season is pretty good, too. Now, as for the music, I honestly thought that both the opening and ending themes of this season left more of an impact than the opening and ending themes of the first. I especially liked &quot;Bye-Bye Yesterday&quot;, the second opening theme; it&#039;s really sad that this anime is ending, and this opening really made me feel the impact of its upcoming end.<br />
<br />
Overall, while I did enjoy season one of Assassination Classroom, season two was even better. If anyone has seen season one and wants to know how it ends, you&#039;d better watch this. I&#039;m personally looking forward to seeing more of these interesting characters in the spin-off, Koro-sensei Q, but for now, we must say goodbye as Class 3-E graduates from their assassination classroom.

&quot;The journey is the reward&quot; - Steve Jobs<br />
<br />
In some cases, plot armor works to help the anime. Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is one of these rare examples. Sure, we know what&#039;s going to happen. Sure, it&#039;s the greatest moment when the entire show builds to it&#039;s climax and then it explodes into a colorful rainbow of nostalgia and emotion. But it can&#039;t wash away all the screw ups of the show in the past, right?<br />
__________________________________________________________________________<br />
STORY: 8/10<br />
<br />
Thankfully, Ansatsu Kyoushitsu rarely screws up, but even if it had, most of it would have been forgotten with the climax to top all climaxes. Ansatsu

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222678">
        gets most of it&#039;s praise from how unique it is, and I won&#039;t argue with that. It&#039;s a very strange concept that almost makes you forget it&#039;s a shonen at points. ALMOST. Being a shonen isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing, though. It just means that it&#039;s prone to the flaws of shonen - arcs that are inferior to others. Again, Ansatsu pretty much blows that out of the water though. None of the arcs are inferior to others, which I feel even works against it at a point, when the final arc was just as exhilarating as one from the halfway point. And, most of the arcs follow a common pattern in shonen - bad guy shows up, minor struggle, you beat him, the next bad guy shows up, slightly larger struggle, you beat him, boss shows up, big struggle, you beat him, recovery episode. Which brings me to the ending. From the very beginning, straight out of episode one, you had been waiting for the death of Koro-sensei. The moment was just as filled with sadness as everyone had predicted, it wasn&#039;t surprising at all. But looking in the episode discussion, you don&#039;t find anybody complaining, even the manga readers were impressed with how well it was handled. In conclusion, Ansatsu is creative, but not quite groundbreaking.<br />
__________________________________________________________________________<br />
ART: 5/10<br />
<br />
Lerche isn&#039;t a very famous studio, and even if you had heard of them before, it probably wasn&#039;t for their mind boggling animation and more likely for their screw up of Daganronpa. When the original season first aired the animation was still pretty mediocre, but it hasn&#039;t improved since then, and the animation around it has, which has made it even more underwhelming. Both the art and animation are bad.<br />
__________________________________________________________________________<br />
SOUND: 6/10<br />
<br />
The first opening theme screams average to me. It sounds like I&#039;ve heard it before, kind of thing. The endings are slightly better but still, 99% of people won&#039;t care to remember or even listen. But every once and a while, there is an theme song that completely outclasses the rest, the one people remember the show for. Bye Bye Yesterday is one of the three openings I&#039;ve listened to so many times in a row I got tired of it. Usually it&#039;s one or two, but with this one it was probably 20 - 30. That&#039;s insane. Actually, I&#039;m amazed I was able to, writing that down. It may seem unbelievable, but it was THAT good to me. The soundtrack gets completely ignored because most of the openings aren&#039;t spectacular, which is such a shame because the innovative soundtrack is one of the show&#039;s best features. Some of it feels a little out of place, like it should be in a mystery show, but it&#039;s still great nonetheless. The average sound effects are made up for by the highly praised seiyuu that voice the characters. Koro-sensei and Karma, in particular, are voices that I could put to the face blindfolded. Ansatsu has it&#039;s ups and downs in the sound department.<br />
__________________________________________________________________________<br />
CHARACTER: 5/10<br />
<br />
Really, Koro-sensei is the only character that I felt was good. He works really well as the series mascot, but if that wasn&#039;t enough, he was also hard not to love. Despite this, I can see why others consider him to be annoying. The other main character, Nagisa, is pretty average for a main character. Acts-weak-but-is-actually-the-best-in-the-class kind of thing. As for the supporting cast... well, this is why Ansatsu is so praised. All of them get their own little development arc, which seemed forced to me. On top of that, the characters really are just templates, design and personality-wise. Just because the show does a good job at featuring them all doesn&#039;t necessarily make them good characters. <br />

Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is definitely show that was meant to for you to not expect anything at all, and then take the viewer by surprise. Did it take you by surprise? Or did you like it anyway? Feel free to comment on my profile and tell me what I did wrong with this review, I&#039;m always up for feedback. Thanks for reading!<br />

    Assassination Classroom season two is a rollercoster ride.<br />
Steering off from the funny assassinations of the first season, season two has a lot more character development and defiantly more feels. The last two episodes left my crying, half in sadness and half in happiness.<br />
If you don&#039;t mind or even want more character development, backstory and tearjearking moments then you&#039;ll love season two even more than the first one. If it&#039;s not your thing then you may still enjoy it, there are still funny moments, silly interactions between characters and some assassinations attempts that stay true to the first season.<br />
<br />
The art and music is as good if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222462">
        not better than the first season, with wonderful openings/endings and beautiful characters this show is great if you like the normal computer animation style done well and great music. <br />
I loved this anime so much and I will probably continue to love it for many years as I do for a few others. <br />
<br />
To sum up, the season season of Assassination classroom is defiantly worth a watch if not for its enjoyable story then for it&#039;s art and music.

    After finishing the first season, I started to question the direction of the story. It had its moments and the comedy was fairly good, but I wasn’t overall very impressed with it. The assassination premise is presented in a colourful and fun manner that it tends to take lightly of its consequences. It glorifies that assassination serves as a way for fellow assassins to create bonds and promote self-improvement. I can’t help but see it as a flaw, given that I’m already used to seinen titles that explore the world of assassination in detail and it’s definitely not all fun and games. The dynamic between

          <span style="display: none;" id="review235880">
        Class E and Koro-sensei is great but the latter still remains a mystery. Little is known about his background and motives. They are all complaints I had but things start to get more interesting as the second season started rolling in. <br />
<br />
The main theme of the second season is graduation. We all know that feeling, sharing fun moments with your fellow classmates inside the classroom. But, you know that they will all come to an end in the inevitable future. Fitting that into the pre-established setting, it unexpectedly works well. Who would have thought that the show can manage to promote that sense of sentimentality despite its assassination theme as each characters reflect on how they have progressed so far. Assassination is taken more seriously now, since it starts to slowly sink in that they will have to kill Koro-sensei eventually and that time is running out, making it an interesting conflict of emotions. Questions are posed such as “What does it really mean to kill?” and “Is there any other way around it?” The fun approach towards it is still there, but it’s toned down a bit.<br />
<br />
The story goes full-force with the sentimentalities of graduation but it tends to breeze past its pre-existing issues such as the education system and the involvement of the government and other external agencies in relation to killing Koro-sensei. It’s a shame that they were never really tackled and explored well while certain episodes are wasted on school activities that has little to do with the ongoing story. It does enhance the reoccurring theme but they feel out of place.<br />
<br />
The show starts to unfold Koro-sensei’s past and makes his motives clear to everyone which is a good thing since that was what often bugs me while watching the previous season. The character development among the cast is starting to be more apparent. The gravity of the situation is starting to get into them and we get to see how they plan to cope up with it even if the situation is over. It’s like being anxious not being to be able to graduate, and the only way for that to happen is to pass the final exam. That final exam is Koro-sensei. He has been with the cast from the start. Despite being an assassination target, everyone becomes attached to him in a way. This further adds up to the sentimentality. <br />
<br />
Overall, if you found the previous season somewhat lacking, then this sequel will somewhat remedies that. It doesn’t resolve every single issue, but it manages to conclude the main story well that leaves you quite the emotional impact. <br />

    (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)<br />
<br />
The best professor who I have ever had the pleasure of learning from goes simply by the name of John.<br />
<br />
John is a complete character. With his long, scraggly beard and expletive-filled conversations, he taught me and my friends two very important life lessons: scratch your itch and quid pro quo.<br />
<br />
“Scratch your itch” means to follow your dreams. You only have this one life, so you may as well make the most of it. I’m scratching my itch by writing and becoming a writer I can be proud of.<br />
<br />
“Quid pro quo” means you have to put

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271301">
        in the effort to get any results. So long as you are determined and willing and focused, success will follow. I apply these words to writing, too, having experienced firsthand what such effort brings.<br />
<br />
Assassination Classroom Second Season has also taught me words to live by: Moving at Mach speed will not solve all troubles.<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Classroom begins almost immediately after where the first season left off. With the kidnapped kids saved and Koro-Sensei out of his protective bubble, the class finishes up their getaway and prepares to take down their teacher within the next handful of months – or face the Earth’s imminent explosion.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for the show, it’s the only one doing the exploding, for it has as many problems (once again) as Koro-Sensei has tentacles.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest being the gross over-exaggeration of many of the events therein.<br />
<br />
For example, Nagisa’s abusive mother goes from calm to insanely ballistic in less than second, making it difficult to take her tantrums seriously.<br />
<br />
The main-campus kids, after one tough study session, start foaming at the mouth, wanting to (in their words) kill the E-Class.<br />
<br />
Koro-Sensei’s death scene is dragged out for as long as alienly possible for a finalized farewell, but it goes on for so long that time must have frozen. (Otherwise, the world would have ended due to overshooting their time.)<br />
<br />
Another way to put it: Classroom has next to zero subtlety when it comes to its emotions, actions, and outcomes. And it can be seen all throughout this second season.<br />
<br />
A different, odder problem is the anime not capitalizing on Koro-Sensei’s weaknesses. The ones that were constantly highlighted. While many of them were for fun, like him getting motion sickness (from the first season) or being a sucker for romance gossip, the vast majority do not get used against him. Not utilizing its Chekov Guns of sort.<br />
<br />
Then the anime actually tries to go the save-Koro-sensei route which is beyond silly. They were trying to kill him for over thirty episodes and it is literally the plot of the show. The whole board a spaceship, fly it successfully to the space station, and threaten the people on board with bombs (to which the astronauts invite them to hang out) makes this entire arc that much more absurd.<br />
<br />
There being a one-percent chance of Koro-Sensei blowing up (or potentially and slowly dwindling away years from now) even if they do save him – meaning it’s not an absolute cure – makes it even worse: pointless.<br />
<br />
Yes, they are kids who do not want their teacher to die after everything he has done for all of them. But when the premise, direction, and events are each geared towards assassinating him, and saving him becomes an idea (and even a possibility) near the last leg (tentacle) of the series, it makes little sense to say the least.<br />
<br />
And getting back to Koro-Sensei’s death scene, the way the class kills him does not even follow the whole premise of the show. They were supposed to assassinate Koro-Sensei since that’s what they were trained to do (let alone “assassination” being in the title of the show).<br />
<br />
But no. Instead, he gets very tired from fighting the new Reaper and resurrecting Kayano, and they all just sit on him and strike a dagger through his heart. (A couple of his weaknesses that the class actually does take advantage of.)<br />
<br />
These issues are the most notable. Smaller problems also add up.<br />
<br />
Despite having assassinations and aliens, the anime chooses to have a (similar) repeat of the exam arc.<br />
<br />
There’s also the kids’ apprehension at attacking Koro-Sensei when opportunities arise, such as when Itona is being used to lure out Koro-Sensei.<br />
<br />
The entire save-versus-kill survival game mini-arc halted progress of the plot without adding much to it (no matter how divisive the class had become).<br />
<br />
Koro-Sensei essentially beating the new (powered-up) Reaper with a beam made of his feelings produces a shake of the head and not a holler of triumph.<br />
<br />
A lot of harping has gone on up to this point, so it would be unfair to not list some positives. For there are a few. “Few” not “many.”<br />
<br />
Classroom does follow-up on some characters and events from the previous season: the romance between Irina and Karasuma, the man in white (who happens to be Kotarou, the researcher who turned Koro-Sensei into who he is), the teenager that Nagisa duped near the end of the first season. Following through on these threads demonstrates that the anime did have a vision in mind moving forward.<br />
<br />
The daycare-helping episode was nice and easily the strongest of the season. The comedy of the kids putting way too much thought and detail into the renovations was smart. Having the kids take a step back and realize that their newfound skills do not permit them to be overly careless and arrogant provided a new perspective. Slyly introducing Reaper into the equation was a good plot point.<br />
<br />
Kayano’s twist was surprising (in a good way). While Classroom technically could have done this surprise with any of its characters, it was an interesting and unpredictable way of going after Koro-Sensei once more and segueing into Koro-Sensei’s backstory.<br />
<br />
But perhaps the show’s best feature is that it actually finishes. The anime completes its story, going so far as to provide a small epilogue to bring as much closure as possible to the tale that was told. This detail seems obvious (since any well-crafted story will finish), but, considering the medium’s penchant for incomplete tales, it’s welcoming to see this nearly fifty-episode long experience fully come to an end.<br />
<br />
Sadly, this second season has more negatives than positives, so the narrative ends up subpar overall.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
Not much can be said about Classroom’s art and animation that was not already brought up last season, for, as expected, both areas remain mostly the same.<br />
<br />
The kids still go to their out-of-the-way building. The detail of the backgrounds is still only marginal at best. And the animation remains roughly similar: lots of phasing and movement whenever Koro-Sensei takes the lead or when the kids are doing their assassination-esque duties, not as much nuance during downtime.<br />
<br />
Although, the anime does make a couple of nice additions to the character-design department. Koro-Sensei shows off a brand-new color – black for absolute anger – and Irina’s extremely attractive casual outfit: a turtle-neck sweater, an unkempt ponytail, and a long, red skirt. Otherwise, the character designs, too, maintain their same level of quality. In this case, a high level of quality.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
Classroom, same as before, has a lot of characters. One may even say a whole classroom’s worth.<br />
<br />
Some, like Yukiko and Manami, got their spotlight in the first season, so their presence (and those similar to them) is not felt all that much. That’s fine because, as was just written, they have already been given attention.<br />
<br />
Some, like Takuya and Masayoshi, receive more on the characteristic side. Takuya’s family runs a ramen shop, and Masayoshi’s name means “Justice.” Once again, other characters of this kind can be seen throughout the show which, once again (again), is fine since the anime is at least trying to showcase as many of the students as possible.<br />
<br />
Some, like Yuuma and Asano, get a little bit more. Parts or even whole episodes aim at their “what a guy” nature or how he values strength not through domination but through demonstration. Either way, it helps to make these characters feel that much more developed or, at the minimum, more meaningful to Classroom beyond only being related to food and nicknames.<br />
<br />
These categorizations cover a large majority of the cast, and, clearly, the show targeted as many of them as time would allow even if that means most of them are neither deep nor intriguing.<br />
<br />
Those characters not apart of the majority must therefore do the heavy lifting. The question is, do they?<br />
<br />
Irina is a character that arguably gets a lot of time (relative to the others). She gets her own mini-arc (shared a bit with the new Reaper), her background story is slightly visualized, and her conflict of not feeling as though she belonged in the world of safety and fun with the students fits her character well since she has often been an outsider of sorts (beautiful beyond compare, a seasoned veteran, a coarse nickname).<br />
<br />
The resolution to her character being that she comes back more relaxed than ever, as well as ending up in a romantic relationship with Karasuma, ends her on as high of a note as possible. (Even if the second half of the season barely has her around.)<br />
<br />
Gakuhou, the evil principal and Asano’s father, also gets much-needed backstory. Surprisingly, he used to teach at the same building that Koro-Sensei does now, doing his best to impart fun and wisdom on his meager class. Unfortunately, after one of his students commits suicide after being bullied at school (after graduating from Gakuhou’s class), he abandons his teaching philosophies entirely, favoring rigorous ideals and unwavering arrogance.<br />
<br />
While the student’s death is tragic, going the complete opposite way in character is quite the shift. Especially when his two other students went on to lead successful lives despite their own (unseen) hardships.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, Gakuhou’s (new) way of teaching is one that Koro-Sensei does not support but recognizes. For while their methods may differ, their aims are the same: give their students the tools to succeed.<br />
<br />
And when Koro-Sensei bests Gakuhou at his own game, the psychotic man finally eases up ever-so-slightly, indicating that even a person as staunch as Gakuhou could be influenced by the yellow alien.<br />
<br />
Nagisa, as the pseudo-main-character, has his path laid out for him as well. He discovers a small love for teaching while working at the nursery. He realizes the gap between his strength and that of the seasoned-veteran Reaper. He “beats” Karma in a one-on-one duel, solidifying his spot as the best assassin as well as his relationship with the red-haired troublemaker.<br />
<br />
Kayano as well. She unveils her tentacle secret as well as the connection she shares with her older sister – who, in turn, shared a connection with Koro-Sensei (before he became Koro-Sensei). Her acting ability allowed her to pretend to be somebody she wasn’t, and she endured agonizing pain every single day in the hopes of attacking and killing Koro-Sensei, demonstrating her fierce hatred of the man who (she presumed) murdered her sister.<br />
<br />
Like how Nagisa chooses to become a teacher instead of an assassin, Kayano, too, chooses the better of the two routes by forgiving Koro-Sensei and apologizing for her actions. Granted, both Nagisa and Kayano are not extensive characters, but they still have some change throughout (however small).<br />
<br />
This all leads to the final, most important character: Koro-Sensei.<br />
<br />
One of the first season’s biggest flaws was opting to ignore anything on Koro-Sensei. Maybe one half-second flashback was shown, but nothing remotely worthwhile about him was given. Thankfully, in this second season, Classroom corrects this error by dedicating an entire episode to Koro-Sensei’s backstory and hence his character.<br />
<br />
And it’s a mess.<br />
<br />
While it was called “backstory,” what is given is more like a quick recap. For Koro-Sensei’s childhood, growth, and life in general is never fully shown. Instead, it’s glossed over and assumed that he becomes the best assassin alive – known simply as the Reaper.<br />
<br />
So, without any actual backstory to go off of for him, it places his character in a weak spot for what follows: namely, captivity at the hands of the researchers. For without knowing about his experiences, ideas, and motivations other than “he is really good at killing,” the show makes it very difficult to resonate with him.<br />
<br />
Then in walks Kayano’s older sister, Aguri. The setup itself is nice. He’s the trapped, charming assassin, she’s the optimistic, odd-shirt wearing lab assistant, and the two slowly start to fall for one another. However, their “moments” together can be counted on a couple of fingers, and they were not exactly romantic given the giant glass wall that separated them.<br />
<br />
It also does not help that pre-Koro-Sensei still has nothing meaningful backing his character, meaning it is hard to gauge what this relationship means for him as a person.<br />
<br />
Regardless, he does seem to have feelings for Aguri. “Seem” because, once he begins to escape the facility, he quickly pushes her away, telling her that she’s “not even worth taking hostage.” Which makes his sudden reversal later, after her death, weird to see. He liked her, then he didn’t care for her, and then he liked her again. Wishy-washy writing.<br />
<br />
And that’s how Koro-Sensei came to be. Aguri’s death sparked him to lead her class to victory as well as turning him into the happy-go-lucky alien. All in all, not very riveting which, considering that Koro-Sensei’s past is arguably the most important piece of information in the series, makes this mishandling of his character arguably the worst offense of the series.<br />
<br />
Near the end, during the final-boss fight, Classroom tries (and fails) to make up some ground by throwing in the twist that the white-robed villain was Kotarou, the researcher that mutated Koro-Sensei, and that his lackey was the new Reaper who, in turn, was once Koro-Sensei’s pupil.<br />
<br />
But Kotarou’s goal of revenge rings hollow since it was a part of Koro-Sensei’s weak background, and the new Reaper’s relationship with Koro-Sensei is only given as fast flashbacks that lack importance (even if one of them involved Koro-Sensei killing the new Reaper’s father and another showed the new Reaper getting Koro-Sensei captured).<br />
<br />
Koro-Sensei’s actual character is a bust, but the wisdom he imparts is not.<br />
<br />
When looking at the series as a whole, what he did and what he taught was certainly unorthodox. After all, not many kids can say they learned in school how to handle knives and stalk their prey. But the beauty of it, like most knowledge that is taught, is that it can be used elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Koro-Sensei did teach them the “basics” to killing. But he also taught them how to help others. How to have confidence. How to simply reach their greatest potential through their own means.<br />
<br />
In other words, Koro-Sensei did not just teach them some skills.<br />
<br />
He taught them how to be themselves.<br />
<br />
So, to answer the question posed earlier, a lot of the characters did do some heavy lifting. And while Koro-Sensei was mishandled, what he did is something that even the audience can appreciate and is definitely worth noting.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The first OP of Classroom comes out strong with switching between male and female singers, a level beat, the “Question” lyrical segment, and a groovy guitar. The second OP is not as interesting, but its catchy-guitar riff and its slightly somber tone help to make it at least a competent piece to lead off the episodes in the second half of the season.<br />
<br />
The first ED is very reminiscent of the first season’s ED. And, while it does not live up to that one’s splendor, this new ED’s relaxation and sincerity contrast well with the show’s craziness and assassinations. The second ED follows a similar sentiment but is even more sincere. Given what goes down, and how the series itself comes to an end, it’s a fitting and heartfelt way to send off the anime (even if the song itself is nothing too special).<br />
<br />
The rest of the OST (and as it was with the art and animation) sticks with what the first one provided. Comedy tracks for when Koro-Sensei acts ridiculous, ominous tracks when the new Reaper intimidates the students, and dramatic tracks for when the class goes through their roll-call.<br />
<br />
And although the voice-acting performances are (yet again) nothing superb, Jun Fukuyama at the minimum deserves another shout-out for continuing his Koro-Sensei-related mannerisms and vocal cues.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
Those that have read my review of the first season know that I was most certainly not a fan of it. This second season did not change my mind. Arguably, it made me dislike the whole series even more.<br />
<br />
I could not stand the whole “clap in their face” ability. I shook my head at how much the show tried pushing this super-cool-and-effective technique that was literally just putting one’s hands together. And it was carried all the way until the end of the series.<br />
<br />
I was also peeved that the anime chickened out on the romance angle. Nagisa’s bold move being excused as just utilizing his assassination toolkit was already lame, but then the anime, after the time-skip, had to bury any chances of him and Kayano getting together by her just not caring about the possibility since Nagisa is doing his own thing or some similar silliness.<br />
<br />
Koro-Sensei continued being an annoying blob. His doofy laugh, his unfunny overreactions, and his near infallibility grated on my nerves.<br />
<br />
The anime even had a lot less of one of my favorite characters: Ritsu. She had some moments, like when she officiated in her police outfit during the cops-and-robbers game or when she was hacked which caused her to become extremely lazy and irritable. But she was not around nearly enough for my liking.<br />
<br />
I did like Irina once again. If only because she was so attractive in her new design and because her getting lovesick was funny to see. And, admittedly, I got a teeny tiny bit emotional during Koro-Sensei’s death scene despite how dragged out it was.<br />
<br />
But when the other drama is lame, the villains are laughable, the characters are bland, and the action is boring, this second season ends up as a unentertaining experience.<br />
<br />
Assassination Classroom Second Season does not get a passing grade. The story finishes and the cast gets attention here and there, but the poor writing decisions, Koro-Sensei’s weak background, and the annoying content make quid pro quo an unequal trade in this situation.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Bad, while flashes of strength can be found, the narrative lacks any subtlety, mires itself in silly plot choices, and even goes against its own premise<br />
<br />
Animation: Fine, okay artistic direction, okay actual animation, and nice character designs<br />
<br />
Characters: Fine, while Koro-Sensei’s character is mishandled yet again, the attention given to the supporting cast as well as their theme on gaining more beyond the “basics” makes the cast at least passable<br />
<br />
Sound: Fine, good first OP, okay second OP, good first ED, okay second ED, okay OST, and okay VA performances<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Terrible, “clapping” induced eye rolling, Koro-Sensei is annoying again, and Irina’s attractiveness can only do so much<br />
<br />
Final Score: 3/10

    Now that you&#039;re reading this review, I&#039;m assuming that you have already watched Season 1. Season 2 starts questionable but ends with a BOOM, it&#039;s better than Season 1 in my eyes.<br />
<br />
The first season raises a lot of questions concerning the single characters, especially Koro-Sensei. Season 2 does a great job at clearing up those. It answers most - if not all - questions there are. Furthermore, it also shows the past of a few other key characters which certainly explains their behaviour. Some of those are surprising and definitely good plot twists. Another strong point of the season is the right mix of serious

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226840">
        and comedic scenes. It starts out rather happily and turns more serious towards the end when the moment of the truth arises: What will happen in March? The ending is a key element of any anime. And with that Assassination Classroom 2 does a great job at ending the show. It is heartwarming and will definitely tear you apart. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if tears would fall from your eyes. But indeed, it is satisfying for the viewer and well chosen for sure. My only concern is that Nagisa didn&#039;t show up at the class meeting of the last scene.<br />
Musicwise, this anime continues to amaze. It reuses a lot of good tracks of the first season which is a plus. Its art and animation continue to be superb. Just as in season 1, Assassination Classroom 2 does an exceptional job at developing the characters. Their bond evolves and every one of the class is part of the anime and thus part of the development. That is especially noticeable in one of the final scenes of the anime when Koro-Sensei does the last attendance check of the class. You know that all characters were involved well in the anime if you can connect with the characters. And I could, that&#039;s for sure. With almost every one of them.<br />
<br />
At last, I want to mention a part that I enjoyed but most people probably either didn&#039;t understand or just couldn&#039;t care less about it. It is the math problem in the final exam. Yes, you&#039;ve heard right, mathematics. I myself do a lot of mathematics and I can confirm that it was a beautiful problem. Showing the two solutions was well done. Especially Karma&#039;s solution was brilliant. It&#039;s a problem that could very well be proposed as an easy olympiad problem.<br />
<br />
Anyway, enough about me blabbering about maths. Assassination Classroom is a masterpiece. And Koro-Sensei is the best teacher there is. So are his quotes.<br />
<br />
Fun times are bound to end. ~Koro-Sensei

    I&#039;m very conflicted about this anime, because on the one hand it is undoubtedly one of the best shows I&#039;ve ever seen, but on the other hand it features both the most beautiful and most soul-crushing episode in existence.<br />
<br />
Story 10/10: It continues from where the first season left off, but the number of light-hearted episodes is drastically reduced and the overarching plot gets much more focus this time around. I actually started watching this because I got spoiled for a quite important plot point and I wanted to know how that came to be, and somehow knowing it would happen made it all the more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302831">
        satisfying when things finally started making sense. And I&#039;m sure that rewatching the first season will be a lot more fun now that I have answers to the questions that were raised back in the first episode, and I will also be able to appreciate the very first episodes so much more now that I know that each of them is meant to teach a lesson.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10: I watched the two seasons back-to-back and while I did notice some changes in the art style overall, mostly in the character designs, it wasn&#039;t anything drastic, which isn&#039;t a bad thing, because I really loved how the first season looked. I will say though that here they had more opportunities to really make the art stand out, especially in the second half of the season.<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10: Like most of the things in this show, the voice acting and music are above average in general but they really stand out in the second half. For starters, the second opening theme is one of the few anime opening themes to make me cry despite being such an upbeat song. I also really loved the first opening theme, and while I didn&#039;t much care for the ending songs, this show features what might possibly be my favourite anime insert song like.... ever.... Apart from that I didn&#039;t really notice too many of the songs used in the background, but that might just be because the serious tone of this season required a much more low-key OST. <br />
<br />
And then there&#039;s the voice acting, which was incredible before but now it&#039;s just absolutely outstanding. Again, thanks to the more serious tone of this season the voice actors really had the opportunity to show their talent, especially in the second to last episode, which might feature some of my favourite voice acting to date. (another special shoutout to Jun Fukuyama for being able to make me cry with two words.)<br />
<br />
Character 10/10: Unfortunately in this season the majority of the focus is centered on the same characters it was in the first season, which might be due to having to adapt such a large number of manga chapters in just 47 episodes, but the standout characters are handled with such care it&#039;s hard for me to complain about it. We get backstories and development and realistic character relationships, and even the antagonists get their fair share of screentime, so much so that it never feels like anyone is evil just for the sake of it. My only problem in this section is the way Irina&#039;s character is handled, especially during the Reaper arc, but apparently that arc is longer in the manga so that might change my perspective on it. Other than that, this show has my favourite mentor figure in all of anime, and also possibly the most terrifying antagonist I&#039;ve come across.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10: I flew through it so fast, there was never a dull moment and I felt incredibly sad whenever I had to stop watching for whatever reason, however I&#039;m not sure sobbing non-stop during the last four the episodes counts as &#039;enjoyment&#039;. <br />
<br />
Overall 10/10: I get attached to fictional characters very easily, and yet no piece of media has ever made me this emotional before. Thanks to that it automatically jumped to the top of my favourite anime series list. As for recommending it, well, if you liked the first season and you like having your heart ripped out in the most brutal way imaginable, this is the show for you. It will probably resonate with you if you have any sort of strong feelings towards education and educators (be they negative or positive) or even if you don&#039;t have any such feelings, it&#039;s worth watching just for Koro-sensei as a character.<br />

(This is my first review be gentle) ^_^<br />
<br />
Hello, Let me start of with saying this series is a one of a kind. A unique story with loads of humor and unlike the first season a bit more serious. The story gets better and you get better understanding for the characters. The enjoyment stays the same (Which is very good). As for now when this show is most likely done, i am layin gin my bed crying missing the charters and wonder what to do with my life now... just as a normal person does after completing a really good anime. Overall this show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222579">
        is a really good time, and you really do feel with the characters. This show made me feel a lot. It was lightheaded at start and one of the most enjoyable anime&#039;s i have ever seen. The passion, the commitment and specially the bond that the students share with their teacher is something that i cannot explain with words. I loved this anime form the bottom of my heart, and if you are reading this i am sure you are considering to watch it... Take my advice! Do it you won&#039;t regret it. It&#039;s rare for me to be this entertained by a show. Sorry if it was not the best review it&#039;s my first however for me to write this review is just because i felt i CANNOT simply drop this anime i need to help it grow. I NEED TO SHOW THE PEOPLE THAT THIS IS &quot;THE&quot; ANIME TO WATCH! #nuruhuhu<br />

All good things must come to an end and the end has finally come! You hear many fans complain about wanting a teacher like Korosensei but my answer to such request is that we already have our own Korosensei! That’s the beauty of this story and character where Korosensei doesn’t act as a teacher for just class 3-E but also for all its viewers! Just like s1 he teaches or at the least reminds us of important life lessons that must be taken to heart. After the dazzling s1 reviews, the hype for this one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review253573">
        was big and I am glad to say they delivered one more time! You wonder what plot points are included this time around and they are pretty much the same as the story starts off exactly where we left off in s1. Since few new arcs are included, much of the 1st half are light toned comedic filler-esque episodes but they help fix one of the problems from s1 and that’s character development of the other students. These characters get their backstory to help fully understand them and the other teachers have their own little romance going! I found Professor Bitch very funny this time around! Even though the story progression is slow, it has so much heart to it hence connecting with the audience on a more personal level! It does fall to a more comical side with that trip to s**** but it more than makes up for it with its perfectly timed humour that delivers many LOL moments! <br />
The clash between class A and class E is further explored and plays more within the main arc. Both classes showcased the different ethics they possessed, thus representing the different teaching styles of their respected teachers. This arc brought both humour and drama to the table, from the way how the exam scenes were portrayed to the rivalry and relationship between Korosensei and the principal. In fact, my favourite character development was of the principal! He wasn’t just a generic bad guy! I hated him in s1 but after understanding his backstory, I felt nothing but sympathy for him and was glad when he started reverting to his old self. And we finally get our backstory on Korosensei! He looks handsome with all that hair! :D Korosensei once again had the best moments of the series and we finally get a look behind the curtain for this octopus creature! Nope for this human! I was craving for it since s1 and the reveal was satisfying! The other main characters like Nagisa, Karma and Kaede are still the ones to get the most screen time which is key to this show and the build-up to the finale was beautifully realized. <br />
<br />
The OP/ED are still okay but much better than last time. I also enjoyed the art work more cause some background scenes were nicely portrayed. In addition, the action scenes were stellar, creating an intense and dangerous atmosphere and the sound effects pleasingly captured the nerve wrecking tension especially during that Nagisa vs Kamina fight! The dub voice acting for Korosensei is still my favourite! <br />
<br />
I had very minute problems with this season which can easily be rounded off to nit-picking! I liked/loved all the episodes and that’s saying something! The laughter at the comedy, enjoyment at the action and overall satisfaction with those inspirational quotes makes this as one of the best anime out there! It sucks that this show doesn’t get the same type of respect and recognition as the other anime’s do! <br />
<br />
!!!!! CONTAIN MAJOR SPOILERS !!!!!<br />
<br />
The set up to the finale was well done because the ending is very emotional and sad! Korosensei reaches his inevitable end as foreshadowed from the beginning. He had grown so much on us that we all wanted him to live somehow but alas the student efforts to save him were in vain. Korosensei’s death was well executed and I was happy they didn’t miraculously bring him back for that would have spoiled the entire finale! Despite being a tearjerker moment, the anime doesn’t end with that note! Rather you have another episode where you see how each of the students of class 3-E ends up after their graduation and that was wonderful to behold! Even if Korosensei no longer exists, his teachings will forever live in our hearts! Those lessons encouraged the kids to follow in their Sensei’s footsteps as if Korosensei is giving part of himself to all of them! After all he wanted them to surpass even him for he wasn’t perfect either. <br />
That was a nice touch with the students coming back to buy the property and preparing the classroom to its original condition for Nagisa to teach their later. Also, that image of Nagisa with Korosensei’s coat was heart breaking! If they do want to carry on with another season, then I would like it to continue with Nagisa as a teacher rather than bringing Korosensei back!

    AP classes, or Advanced Placement Classes are a kind of challenge that students put themselves through in order to show that they&#039;re the best of the best or much higher level than the rest.  These courses are much faster than their &#039;less advanced&#039; counterparts, have much more material to them, and are usually less fun.  So why do I make this analogy?  Well, if AssClass S1 is a standard course, AssClass S2 is an AP course.  Case in point, onto the lecture as to why this show isn&#039;t as good as people may say it is.<br />
<br />
Story: Continuing off from the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222494">
        season, the story of AssClass S2 as stated from its release, that the rest of the manga would be finishing up in this one 2-cour series.  It&#039;s a finished series, start to finish, nothing really left behind.  Sounds good, right?  Well, here&#039;s the problem with that.<br />
<br />
The entirety of the manga is about 180 or so chapters.  Season 1 of the series adapted around 60 or so chapters with 2 cours to complete said chapters.  Season 2 on the the other hand has the same runtime of 2 cours but adapts 120 chapters instead.  Using simple math, this season is adapts around twice as much material as its first season counterpart.  So, what&#039;s the point of this simple math equation?  Well, the answer to that is the simple fact that this season is HORRENDOUSLY rushed.  Due to the fact that this one season had to adapt about twice as much material as the first season, the content that we&#039;re shown has a lot of problems.  <br />
<br />
The first problem that this adaptation shows us is the fact that none or very few of the given arcs that we&#039;re shown actually sink in.  Many portions of the anime have character development for a certain side character that is integral to the series that falls flat due to the fact that the show speeds through their portion of the series in 1-2 episodes without very much detail.  We&#039;re given just the outline of what happens to the character rather than the full essay that makes us even give a damn.  As a result, the development feels stagnated and forced, being practically just thrown in there to make the audience care instead of easing into each arc and telling the story at an even pace.  The pacing also affects several other parts of the anime, but I&#039;ll get to that later.<br />
<br />
But enough of the pacing, how does this the middle and end of the story compare to its beginning?  Well, it&#039;s a B- at best.  While the show does give us some pretty worthwhile arcs that not only give development to characters that we otherwise would&#039;ve though to be worth spiting than liking, as well as some rather heartwarming moments, the show doesn&#039;t keep very much consistency in quality.  Due to its rather short runtime for a series with so much content, Lerche prioritized certain parts of the series and left others to hang back, thus creating this gap of importance that felt unfair.  Not only that, but the series loses quite a lot of its luster at the end of the series with some rather...unfavorable arcs that just seemed downright stupid for this series.  (Cue the random-ass Space Plot)  Plus that final fight was probably the most uneventful fight in the entire series and it was just a big disappointment all around.<br />
<br />
Overall, AssClass S2 is a mixed bag of positives and negatives with more C&#039;s than A&#039;s.  Its pacing throws a lot of the content and characterization that the story has out the window, focusing solely on the progress of its title character, Koro-Sensei rather than the focused side-plots that aided in progressing the story.  Its pacing leaves far too much to be desired, but It has an extremely nice and heartwarming last few episodes and great lessons that really makes the series come together in a nice, wrapped bow.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Finishes the series<br />
+ Characterization for many of its arcs<br />
+ Heartfelt ending<br />
-  TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE pacing<br />
-  Characterization feels forced and uneven<br />
-  More of an outline than an actual story<br />
-  Some pretty bad arcs, particularly at the beginning and end areas<br />
-  Disappointing climax moment<br />
<br />
Characters: Characters are probably the other biggest hit in quality when it comes to the impact of pacing, which once again, really hampered this series from becoming as great as it could&#039;ve been.<br />
<br />
Koro Sensei, the title character of the series.  The majority of this season in particular is centered around Koro Sensei.  Not only do we get to see more of his impact as a character and what he does to help the other characters that are around him, but we also get to see more of him as a character.  Since the series is about killing this overpowered octopus man, pretty much everything that this season has to offer is revolved around him and his teaching policies.  The series puts a lot of attachment to the character and despite its terrible pacing, really does shine through at times and makes those moments all the more sweeter.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s Class 3-E.  My problem with season 1 came at the fact that the series just sort of characterized the ENTIRE CLASS as one character.  Due to the manga having an abundance of chapters that focused solely on one member of the class, each character, or at least a great deal of them, felt more like individuals rather than one whole group.  Similar to its S1 predecessor, this season doesn&#039;t really do a good job in the way of making each class member seem unique and just sorta lumps them all together with the exception of our protagonist, Nagisa who we follow the POV of, and Kaede who...well, let&#039;s just say she&#039;s a character who gets an entire arc to herself.  Though for the most part, the rest of the class are just background characters that have some unusual quirks here and there.  I doubt anyone can remember more than 10 of the 29 or so class members.  Hell, I can&#039;t even do it.<br />
<br />
And for side characters, we have a group of recurring and new additions to the side cast.  Now, one thing that makes this side cast so much better than the majority of other side casts is the one fact that everyone in this side cast has value, or at least has a dedicated arc to them that adds more to the series.  They all have some sort of worth, probably even more worth than the majority of Class 3-E, and that makes them not only memorable, but more important in the grand scheme of things.  However, there are a few strange motives amidst some of the &#039;antagonist&#039; related characters and that doctor guy just really...didn&#039;t do anything.  (If you&#039;ve seen the series, you&#039;ll know who I&#039;m referring to.)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Koro-sensei is a great character<br />
+ Characterization for some protagonist and especially for the side cast<br />
-  Some strange motives for some antagonist characters<br />
-  Class 3-E felt like a lumped up group rather than a group of individual characters<br />
<br />
Art: Produced by Lerche, the art for Assassination Classroom S2 is the same style and quality that the first season has.  It has this light and bright style that has this really unique contrast that could be both bright and cheerful but also brooding and dark at the same time, which is really commendable due to how quickly the series contrasted between fun and cheerful with serious and dark.  Akin to the manga, the show also uses a lot of symbolism or motifs to represent certain parts or characters of the series to better bring its point across which I personally always appreciated.<br />
<br />
One special mention that I want to point out is the design for the female Class 3-E military uniforms.  Lerche changed the design of the female outfits when adapting the series by losing the open midriff area that the girls had to show off their curves in black clothing and instead lengthening their jacket to cover up that area.  While many people probably never noticed or probably never cared, I personally really like this change because with all of the combat that goes on in this series, having that extra layer of protection on an area that has been noted in many anime and shows for being notoriously hard to heal back or recover from really helps protect these middle school assassins a bit more.<br />
<br />
For comedic moments, the show used more exaggerated appearances more than anything else to bring home its more cheerful and fun moments in the series.  Aside from that, there really isn&#039;t much else.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Unique and extremely flexible artstyle<br />
+  Usage of symbolism<br />
+/- Rather bland comedic stylings<br />
<br />
Sound: The OPs for this season...really don&#039;t stand out.  They&#039;re two songs that don&#039;t really sound much different from one to the other and I personally didn&#039;t care for them all too much because of how meh and similar they sounded.  They were like the first season&#039;s OPs in terms of styling and I&#039;m honestly quite surprised how similar all four of them sounded to each other cause it&#039;s just the Class 3-E seiyuus singing a rock tune.<br />
<br />
For ED&#039;s, the first one doesn&#039;t really come out to me all that well.  It&#039;s gentle and nice, but it doesn&#039;t really feel or seem all that memorable or special.  This second ED however, is by far the best track that the series has had from start to finish.  Known as &quot;Mata Kimi ni Aeru Hi&quot;, this song is a gentle and calm ballad that evokes and capitalizes on the overall connection with Koro-sensei that Class 3-E has.  It&#039;s sounds very heartfelt and with where in the series that it was placed (which was ep. 15-25), it&#039;s easily the most memorable song that this soundtrack has to offer.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Memorable and fantastic second ED<br />
-  Rest of the tracks fall flat<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment: As someone who has read the AssClass manga start to finish, this adaptation really grinded my gears for many reasons.  And yes, it may seem like everything that has been said up till now has been biased because you may be thinking &quot;Oh, he read the manga, he knows everything that happens and the manga is always better than the anime, neh&quot;, but let me convince you otherwise.  Lerche did their best to adapt this series to the best of their ability.  They only had so many episodes and they had to finish the entire manga, so there was absolutely NO WAY that they would be able to cram in everything without leaving some things behind.  What they did was they took the main arcs or most influential parts of entire manga and adapted those to give us that ending feeling.  These problems were inherent and there was no way that this adaptation was going to go as well as it could&#039;ve because of that.  That being said, onto the questions.<br />
<br />
Did I like this anime?<br />
<br />
When all is said in done, I would say my opinion towards this adaptation is average.  Despite all its flaws, Lerche managed to pull off a well-done adapted conclusion to the series that saved a lot of my personal salt that I had watching certain things get cut out due to the pacing issues.<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this anime?<br />
<br />
I&#039;m just gonna say it, like I have many times over, pacing.  The only thing that has to be blamed for the failure of this adaptation is its pacing.  Having to make an adaptation with 2x the content in the same amount of time is an extremely tall order for any animation studio and as such, barely anything got the attention that they deserved and I really wished they did another season and give this story the attention it deserves, cause quite honestly, this adaptation missed out on A LOT of small details that had a decent amount of impact.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this anime?<br />
<br />
Personally, I would say to just read the manga.  As usual, the idea of &#039;The manga is always better&#039; prevails yet again cause there&#039;s no time constraint and since the entire series is finished, you can read everything from start to finish without missing a single detail.  Though if you&#039;re lazy and would rather watch what happens instead, then I would say go right on ahead.  Personally, I would not say it is as good as many people say it is, but the adaptation does have merits, such as some favorite choice moments being animated, but it has its merits and unlike many adaptations, finishes up a rather well-made story that teaches us the joys of learning and killing.  C+ for this one, Lerche, C...+.

    Assassination Classroom has now become my favourite anime of all time. The first season makes the entire thing seem like a pure comedy anime , but anyone who has finished both seasons will know this is not the case. The second season is absolutely amazing , just as you think you know how the anime will end there are 2 huge twists in the story. All of the questions are answered in season 2. Assassination Classroom also has very little filler. When a certain activity or situation does take up an entire episode , it is always for a very good reason or important to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review225834">
        the story. Do not watch season 2 without having seen season 1 , It will have little to no impact on you and you will probably be quite confused. With 47 episodes in season 1 and 2 in total , the length is perfect. It fits every detail in without falling short and without having a ridiculous amount of episodes. Korosensei&#039;s lessons are at times mind blowing and the ending to season 2 is the best anime ending I have ever seen .

    This is undoubtedly the best anime I&#039;ve watched in my life thus far, its so unique you can define it as a genre itself, and that&#039;s what makes  Ansatsu Kyoushitsu so good<br />
the first season was enjoyable made me laugh smile and maybe even cringe at points with certain jokes, but in a good way of course !<br />
<br />
But this 2nd season, oh boy, sit down grab some popcorn because i surely have my points to put out there to convince you watch this anime i have never written a review before and never intended to, but this has to be done<br />
<br />
Story 9- Season 1 has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review225611">
        left many of our questions unfolded, like who is Koro? whats his past? why this class? and many others, and i feel like those answers came in the best way possible, look i would give a 10 at this, but i felt like some episodes weren&#039;t focused on the story itself some felt like fillers for Character development, or in a way for us to get attached to some character but at the same time i wont be happy with giving this a 9 either because this anime has overall one of the best endings I&#039;ve ever seen too!<br />
<br />
Art 10- this may be the only point tha&#039;ts hard to describe as the concept of art may change from person to person, and so as this is my review im giving this one a 10<br />
why you ask? i feel like they made the character look exactly how the should, their personalities match their looks, Nagisa may not be the most gorgeous boy in the world but he isn&#039;t meant to be, they sure could have done a better job at it but what would the point be? Karma looks great for example but that suits him<br />
also the combats and the especial effects are over the roof, paying attention to the details after watching this for the fifth time each combat is well thought <br />
i love what they do with the eyes of some characters as they are about to engage on combat or prove some points right<br />
<br />
Sound-9- &quot;Tabidachi no Uta&quot; i&#039;m just saying that, don&#039;t look it up on youtube you may get MANY spoilers so please don&#039;t<br />
and i feel like the sound crew did a good job picking each sound of each moment #approved<br />
<br />
Character-10 Prepare your jaws to drop when watching this season because oh boy oh boy, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! finally an anime that isn&#039;t 400 episodes long (or that isn&#039;t Tokyo Ghoul) and has INSANE character development and i&#039;m not even focused on the main character, I literally mean ALMOST everyone! Koro sensei is also my favorite anime character of all time the jokes, the advice, how much he cares for his students the happy moments the sad moments he&#039;s been through, watching him brings me joy<br />
Enjoyment 10? really? cant it go higher because i want to give this 100/10<br />
I&#039;ve never laughed so hard, smiled so much, and cried so bad during an anime, all those points, Clannad may have shattered my heart, but this anime broke it, I&#039;ve seen some reviews and they cite how sad some moments in this anime are so i&#039;m not giving away any sort of spoilers, there are going to be some sad moments<br />
 <br />
Overall-11 best anime 10/1 would watch again for the 6th time i have never felt so many emotions at once<br />

    Probably some spoilers, sorry:<br />
<br />
Art (9)/Sound (8): I really don&#039;t get it when people say the animation of this show isn&#039;t good. Most of the time, the art style looks awesome and is incredibly appealing. And when the animation  needs to be awesome, it is. Koro-sensei&#039;s tentacles look awesome when they need to, and the stylized character designs lend themselves to a wide variety of expressions and emotions for the characters to display. The sound is pretty good. Both EDs are kinda sad and slow (not very fitting for the tone of most of the show) but are a great foreshadowing for the later parts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224269">
        of the show. Both OPs are pretty good, though I way prefer the second to the first. The ENG dub isn&#039;t very good. Most of the characters feel miscast (except Koro-sensei, who is hilariously played by the same guy who played Hughes in FMA). But the JP dub is pretty awesome. The voice actors do a good job of getting the character&#039;s emotions and personalities across. Karma&#039;s voice is the best in my opinion. Though, I&#039;m probably biased because I love Karma. <br />
<br />
Story (9): I have to say, that the story definitely gets better as the season goes. It starts pretty much exactly where the last one left off, then jumps back into it&#039;s episodic format after the whole Itona conflict. I&#039;d say the story gets awesome again at about episode 14. Not that it&#039;s bad before that. The structure of the show usually lends itself to occasional serious and intense stories interjected with light and fun episodic stories. None of these episodic stories are necessarily bad, it&#039;s just the parts where the story is really allowed to shine are the best. And that is episode 14. <br />
After this episode, the story is pretty awesome for the rest of the show.<br />
<br />
Characters (10): The characters have pretty much always been my favorite part of Assassination Classroom. Karma reigning as the king. I LOVE KARMA. Which is probably one of the reasons I like this season more than the last one. Karma is given a lot more screen time, and an entire mini-arc is dedicated to his relationship with Nagisa. Probably my favorite three episodes the ENTIRE SERIES. OMG! These episodes are amazing. It shows just how well they know each other. That hesitation that Nagisa shows at the end of their fight, because he knows how tricky Karma is, how Karma doesn&#039;t take his opportunity to beat Nagisa because he knows he wouldn&#039;t listen if he beat him that way. It adds new layers to their relationship and shows how close they really were before they drifted apart. OMG! I love this mini-arc! But Karma and Nagisa aren&#039;t the only good characters. Koro-sensei is as awesome as always. Kaede gets her own little mini-arc. And I still love Sugino. Though not all the characters are created equal. Not many of them get major focus, which is sad, but the ones who do are amazing.<br />

    After glancing at the scores on the other reviews, it has quickly become clear that I do not share the popular opinion in regards to this season of Assassination Classroom. While I thought the first season was pretty average, I think this season was worse.<br />
<br />
I have the same criticisms for this season as I did for the one previous (ie. Korosensei being the only real enjoyable character, juvenile humor, &amp; the student&#039;s lack of concern for how the fate of the world is in their hands for the majority of the season). Unfortunately, those are not my biggest gripes with this season. <br />
<br />
The second season

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357907">
        of Assassination Classroom starts with more of the same of what we have grown to expect from the series. However, about a third of the way in, the show takes a more &quot;serious&quot; tone, but does not handle it well. Minus the end villain, most of the new villains/obstacles that the main characters face never seem to take more than 2 episodes to overcome, and all it takes is for Korosensei or a student to do some talking to resolve the issue. Not that I expect everything in this series to be realistic, but the ease of overcoming obstacles by merely having a conversation really hindered my enjoyment of this season.<br />
<br />
On a more positive note, I did enjoy finally getting to see Korosensei&#039;s back story &amp; found the ending quite touching.

     The secont season of assassination classroom was great.You learn everyting you need to know about what happented to the past and the story becomes MUTCH better than the first season.<br />
<br />
 It has many touching sinces and so mutch fun at the same time, it also has a great story that was hidden in the first season and some new great characters... I think it was a splendid anime and i loved it.<br />
<br />
I Highly recoment you to watch it (no matter the age) and i am sure you will love it as i did.<br />
<br />
My score is 9 for the secont season because i liked it

    A gem! It truly deserves a perfect 10. It&#039;s very unique and can teach you a lot of morals and lessons. It felt like I was a part of class 3-E! I loved the story and the characters and their development. It made me laugh, excited, anxious, cry, and feel inspired and satisfied. Looking for something good and something to make you feel alive? I&#039;d say that you have to watch this.<br />
<br />
I really loved every episode. The story was moving. Everything was great! The characters, the story, the art, the music, but what got to me the most was the morals and lessons that Koro

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229031">
        Sensei was teaching &#039;cause they could be applied in real life. I think that this is the best &quot;no-nonsense&quot; anime I&#039;ve seen. I&#039;m sure to watch this again sometime in the future!<br />
<br />
Be sure to watch the first season or you&#039;ll miss out on a lot of things.

    So season one was good i thought it was very funny but when season two started i  just knew it would be way different because march was coming.<br />
<br />
It started off like the first season but when i got to find out about Koro sensei and all the other peoples backstories i already knew this season would be way better because this made me understand what was happening and why. After the huge journey it felt like i was a part of the class and it just made me love it even more and was just a great journey overall.<br />
<br />
The plot and everything that happened

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338966">
        was perfectly made out the fact that they wanted to kill him but changed there mind showed how Koro sensei had an effect on the class and on me because he was a good guy. <br />
<br />
But all good things have to come to an end,overall a 9/10 because there is always room for improvement and i would have loved to seen a few more episodes of the characters all grown up even one full episode dedicated to them all grown up would have been good but if you haven&#039;t watched this and are bored out during quarantine this will make you feel like you are back in school but instead of working you watching and having a good time.<br />

    The story of the Assassination Clasroom is so beautifully written to pass on important messages and morals, about life and death, what it means to be a teacher and connections we have with the world around us. It makes you connect with the characters and feel their emotions from start to finish,you understand their pain as they have been rejected from their normal society for different reasons and you get to know each and every character (despite the amount of them) and its easy to imagine yourselves as part of that. This show is a must watch for anyone, and will touch the hearts of

Thank You Koro-Sensei.

    This is my first review so I will do my best to describe my thoughts on this anime.This is one of the few anime that I rated 10 but for good reasons.The anime is one of the few animes which makes you laugh at times and makes you cry at the same time.Its wonderful how the anime turned into a feels trip towards the end while it makes you laugh initially.The characters are all memorable and leave a lasting impression.Make sure you watch season one so you won&#039;t miss out on the story.
