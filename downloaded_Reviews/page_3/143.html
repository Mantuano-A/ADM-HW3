    Definitely some spoilers, don&#039;t read if you don&#039;t want to be spoiled.<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
The story became very repetitive at this point. Most of the episodes were: Go from current point to next point, encounter enemy Stand user, defeat stand user, repeat until we reach Dio. It became a monster-of-the-week series and it just felt really bland. The fights varied somewhat but in the end I was expecting a little more than what was essentially an RPG grind until you hit max level and go do an end game boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
The art style definitely made everything feel more dramatic and dark, while the backgrounds gave a really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205519">
        good view of what Egypt looks like (at least from someone who hasn&#039;t been there). The characters themselves are very detailed with proper shadings of clothing which makes them look &#039;realistic&#039;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
The op of the first season was really good and it got you pumped up and it made you feel manlier just by listening to it. But this second season&#039;s op just reminded me of Rozen Maiden, it doesn&#039;t fit. The voice acting is the same as the first season so if you liked it there, you&#039;ll like it here, especially hearing Jonathan yell &quot;AWEEE MAIII GAWDDDDD&quot; or &quot;SHIIIIITTTT&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: 5<br />
The villains felt very cliched in that they&#039;re always over the top sadistic with no redeeming qualities. Each one was basically just &#039;bad guy with certain bad trait&#039; repeated over and over every episode until we got to Dio. <br />
<br />
Dio - Dio maintains his arrogance and threatening nature which definitely made him feel like an end raid boss and reinforces his antagonistic role.<br />
<br />
Joutarou - If you can call standing around, posing &#039;cool&#039; and saying &quot;Yare Yare Daze&quot; as being a character... well... he&#039;s a character for you then. Initially, this was kind of cool, the nonchalant, tough without overtness attitude, but after two seasons of this composure, it starts to become dull and repetitive. Any encounters that involve Joutarou is basically resolved before it even begins and all you&#039;re left doing is thinking how far his legs are going to be apart this time and how angled is his body going to face.<br />
<br />
Jonathan - Not as cool as when he was younger with all his predictions but still a staple character that is hilarious when he swears/yells in Engrish. <br />
<br />
Polnareff - Basically the comic relief of the show but his character really shines during his emotional moments with his comrades, especially Iggy.<br />
<br />
Iggy - I initially didn&#039;t like him as his existence felt out of place most of the time as he didn&#039;t do very much, but in later episodes his character really develops and I liked him near the end. <br />
<br />
Avdol - A firm, stable character that really cares for his friends and even sacrifices himself. Things actually happen to him which makes him feel mortal and human.<br />
<br />
Kakyouin - Really stayed the same from the first season though his bonds with his comrades grows stronger. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
Definitely wasn&#039;t as enjoyable as the first season as the encounters with the other Stand users felt very repetitive and monster-of-the-week. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
At this point, it just became repetitive until we came to the final showdown between Dio and JoJo.

    An action-packed adventure of fun, bizarreness, crazy gimmicks, and dangerous distinction. Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders: Second Season (or Egypt Arc) provokes the question of what the audience wants to see next. The first half of the adaptation already showed plenty of Stands ranging from one that can attack via reflective surfaces, a parasitic being that can enter a victim’s brain, or even a Stand that can attack in dreams with Freddy Krueger style. The answer is simple really. It continuously deliver a source of imaginative and entertainment that almost anyone will find entrancing.<br />
<br />
As a direct continuation of the first season, it’s imperative to watch

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190635">
        it before venturing into the Egypt Arc. Otherwise, you’ll be wondering around like a goat in a desert. Propelled by the series’ vision to craft a dynamic adventure, we are introduced to new allies and enemies. Of course, the main cast returns as well including Jotaro, Joseph, Avdol, Kakyoin, and Polnareff. Joining them is a new ally in the form a dog named Iggy. Bringing in non-human characters into a series always presents a challenge but Iggy isn’t just an ordinary house common animal. He has a Stand and there’s even an episode that really brings out his abilities for the audience to see. <br />
<br />
Because the first season has exhausted Dio’s resources and servants, we are introduced to new and more dangerous enemies for the crusaders. Adapting well with its Egyptian theme, these new enemies presents a challenge like never before. We have Big Bads that do all sort of otherworldly things that people can’t even begin to imagine. It really brings a focus to Jotaro and his friends as they struggle to survive. A good measure of the fights not just test them on a physical level either but mentally as well. The D’arby siblings are a good example of this as they rely on trickery and deception to get what they want by pitting their enemies in twisted mind games. Then, there’s also the creativity coming from the brainchild of the series, Hirohiko Araki. The characters he makes not just possess a diverse range of personalities but also has Stands that bring out their sheer tenderness. As daring as some of his ideas are, they work well when it comes to bringing a mixture of thrilling excitement, mystery, and humor.<br />
<br />
Indeed, the comedy for the series is like no other. From the artistic style of Boingo’s Tohth to Sethan’s power of age manipulation, there’s almost something in it for everyone to witness. Furthermore, the gimmicks of the show return in full with our main characters’ personalities. They may all have different personalities but their goal in hand is the same – to save Holly from death. As such, expect the mood of the story to get more and tenser as the journey takes them closer and closer into Dio’s palace. However, there will still be times when the story feels like a ‘monster of the week’ style. Certain characters also makes reappearances that gives them another chance to shine.  For what’ worth, this second season behaves in a similar way with the first half in conjunction with their journey. Then, the latter half really picks up the pace as we get to the grand stage. Patience is a key to understand and enjoy the show as David Productions is willing to adapt the most important element of the story. To capture that style of Jojo is never easy but adapting with a steady pacing with weekly doses of adventure is something to take granted for. As such, I recommend watching this show in a weekly style rather than a whole marathon. It will leave you wanting for more as each episode brings something new to the table. And when the battle against Dio draws to its climax, you’ll realize that the patience was well worth waiting for.<br />
<br />
The artwork of the second season along with its soundtrack remains generally the same but still retains the sense of exhilarating fun. Taking place in Egypt, we get more of the classic Egyptian-like atmosphere with more desert themes involved. As such, expect the soundtrack to reflect a bit of that culture. Opening theme songs are also clear with its choice by orchestrating the classic Jojo style that we should all be familiar with by this point. Surprisingly though, the ED theme songs has a more vibrant and melancholic tune. While seemingly off balance in some sense, I find it to be captivating as it creates a sense of serenity. Finally, there’s also the character voices that each reflect dynamically at how the characters behave. The villains’ textural motives also has a good amount of credible voice mannerisms to make the audience feel what their roles are. Then, there’s the artwork that continuously dedicates itself to capture what this journey been – crude, dangerous, and insane. However, that’s all in a good way. (minus some editing of the censors) David Productions’ visual standards impresses with their work by delivering stellar landscapes, well-made architectures, and a wealth of character designs to make the audiences awe. Similarly, expect the action to blow you out of the seats with its extensive prowess.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, the second season is what you will expect and get. And that would be thrilling action packed adventure of non-stop pandemonium. It’s a show that unites all sorts of strange gimmicks to deliver what the audience wants. Assuming that you like stunts, unpredictable characters, mind games, or dynamic comedy, then this season will be quite a looker. Now, this might not be a show for anyone though. There are at times problems when people feel like pacing becomes sour and certain parts from the original source omitted. Or there may be certain characters that get lesser screen time than others. However, the adventure never stop at its mark and packs its bag. Instead, it shows why the series is called Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. And that is freaking awesome. <br />

    When you&#039;re in the world of anime and manga, there are these popular and trending materials that are too long and big to take up and follow. No matter how hard you try to ignore these trends, they keep popping up, and it almost feels like it is impossible to stay up to date in the anime world without watching/reading them. At least for me, not staying up to date is like being dead in this world of anime.<br />
JoJo was one of these trending things, and I tried real hard to ignore it, because  getting myself in the JoJo world would only fatten up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190682">
        my backlog. However, then back in 2012, I heard JoJo manga (which is quite old) is getting animated, and thought this was a good chance for me to get myself into the series.<br />
May be I was crazy or something, but I thought at that time, it would be better for me to finish the manga before I watch the anime. This doesn&#039;t  mean you have to do the same thing and read the entire manga before watching the show! I mean, I loved the manga, but it&#039;s really your choice, because the anime has done an excellent job faithfully adapting the source material.<br />
The entire JoJo show is 26+48 episodes. I know it is a daunting task to watch all that, but the show is a fun-ride that is fast and satisfying.<br />
My point it that JoJo is quite an old franchise, which is still very popular in modern times, so if you want to stop wondering what all the JoJo hype is all about, this fun show is an excellent starting point. I recommend you start watching this now if you are interested, because sequels might come flying in soon in the future (meaning your backlog will only get greater....yuck)<br />
<br />
So, if you are looking for:<br />
Meticulously animated fun, swift, merciless, cathartic actions<br />
Silly, over-the-top but clever thrills<br />
Character interactions grotesquely fun<br />
Ridiculously Faithful adaptation of the source material<br />
Shows without silly unnecessary soap opera-esque romances and fillers<br />
Manly Men full of manliness<br />
<br />
and/or if you are just curious what all this JoJo is about...<br />
<br />
This show is for you.<br />
(so if you decide to watch this, be sure to start from Parts 1 and 2 from 2012~)

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS <br />
<br />
I&#039;m gonna make this quick since this is basically just a continuation of the last season, read my review of Part 3 season 1 for my general opinion on Part 3, as this only covers my thoughts on the Egypt arc.<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
<br />
First of he pacing improves drastically here, less time feels wasted, I think every fight being at least 2 episodes long helps that, instead of a large assortment of personality-less glorified monsters of the week, we get a cast of underdeveloped, but memorable villains, which I&#039;ll elaborate more on in the characters section.<br />
<br />
My biggest problem with the show is how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314077">
        shallow and lacking in substance it is, Jojo&#039;s is often spoken of as if it&#039;s some literary classic, a master class in Japanese animation, up there with Hunter x Hunter and Berserk, but with those series, they have themes, characters who develop, villains with interesting personalities or motives, something that makes people care about what will happen to the characters, but Jojo has none of that, there are no overarching themes, only 1 character (quickly) develops in the arc, the villain has neither an interesting personality nor interesting motives, Jojo, especially part 3, tends to be a nothing story, stuff happens sure, but it&#039;s so bland, predictable and cookie cutter that makes me wonder how so many people fell in love with this show. Say what you will about Naruto or DBZ, at least they have themes and well developed characters, Jojo has NOTHING besides some cool fight scenes, so really, in terms of story, you&#039;re better off watching any other shounen battle show.<br />
<br />
One more thing, the way Jotaro beats Dio shows just how hollow Part 3 is, instead of using his wits, instead of taking avantaged of Dio&#039;s weaknesses, instead of teaming up with another character, Jotaro beats Dio by punching him so hard that he explodes, yes really, that is actually the way this conflict ends, 48 episodes, all building up to Jotaro just punching the main villain really really hard, 48 episodes, that&#039;s 16 hours, imagine having to site through 16 hours of boring characters and a story with zero substance, expecting there to be an awesome finale, and then it just ends with Jotaro punching Dio. Does this sound like a series worth watching?<br />
<br />
Character: 3/10<br />
<br />
For my opinions on Jotaro, Joseph, Kakyoin, Avdol, Polnareff and Hol Horse, check out my review of the first season of Part 3.<br />
<br />
Season 2 introduces a dog named Iggy, for most of the arc he just wanders around, and outside of his debut episode and some of the last few episodes, does nothing useful, he just bites Polnareff and farts on him every episode, comedy gold, but then during one fight at the end, he suddenly develops into a hero, why? Because Araki probably realized now one liked Iggy because a character who does nothing but bite and fart isn&#039;t really likeable, hey at least it&#039;s something, it&#039;s better than the other characters who don&#039;t develop, at all.<br />
<br />
Season 2&#039;s antagonists are a vast improvement over season 1, rather than the glorified obstacles, we have a set of memorable, if underdeveloped and under utilized villains, these characters would be much better in the hands of a better writer who doesn&#039;t use a monster of the week formula, but sadly they got stuck with Araki. Some highlights are Boingo, a shy kid stand user who&#039;s not really evil but is force to do evil by his older brother whom he idolizes, and later Hol Horse, speaking of, Hol Horse is back, he hasn&#039;t really changed but it was nice to see him one more time. There&#039;s Anubis, not really that interesting but a userless stand that posses other stand users is a nice change of pace. There are also some really boring villains, similar to the ones from Season 1, like Vanilla Ice, who&#039;s entire personality is that he&#039;s loyal to Dio, same goes for Maria, who&#039;s just another cackling maniac.<br />
<br />
Dio is somehow even worse than in Part 1, at least in Part 1 he had a concrete goal, here, he just sits and waits for the heroes to come and fight him, he&#039;s less like a villain and more like the final boss in an old video game, he has no personal connection with any of the main characters, besides Polnareff, but he&#039;s out of commission for most of the fight, this is the first time he even meets Jotaro and Joseph, who end up doing most of the fighting, Jotaro barely cares about the quest they&#039;ve been on for 48 episodes, there is no narrative or thematic reason for him to beat Dio, other than by virtue of being the &quot;main character&quot;, it&#039;s like Araki stopped giving a shit when it came to Dio, he gave us a cool fight but no substance, no reason to care about these characters.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
<br />
Still great, check my review of Part 1/2 for more details.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
The tracks are the same as season 1 but the op and ed are changed, check my review of season 1 for more details.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10<br />
<br />
About as terrible as the last season, with only slight improvements made to pacing and characters.

    The second season of JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders is the when all the real stuff of the 3rd part of JoJo manga happens. <br />
<br />
It picks up right where the first season left off and doesn&#039;t waste a moment to start doing what Stardust Crusaders does best, and that is episodic, intense, imaginative fights. Not much is changed in the overall sturcture of the show. It still follows the formula of traveling from one place to another, and encountering new enemies on the way in an episodic manner. <br />
<br />
The cream of the entire show are fights, and I am happy to say that the second

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191138">
        season is where most of the better fights from the manga take place. The fights in the second season are longer and way more intense and imaginative. The fact that unlike the first season, the second one has a define ending, really helps the show too. I honestly think that both season should be judge as one anime show, because they are just a single story, divided in two parts, because it would take too many episdoes to adapt it all in one season.<br />
<br />
The show is still over the top as all and rather silly or dumb at places. Thankfuly it knows when not to take itself seriously and thus the sillyness never really hinders the experience too much.<br />
<br />
This season has a healty dose of fun episodes and moments, is also has a healthy amount of rather touching and sad parts. Some characters get a bit more development, some don&#039;t. We also get a new character in the face of Iggy the dog, who is heck lot of fun to watch and really adds to the chemistry of the entire group.<br />
<br />
The art style is still awesome looking. The soundtrack is more of the same for the most part, not that there is anything wrong with that. The soundtrack for the first season was really good by itself. Even if the animation itself is pretty static, the design,style and directing make the anime look wonderful.<br />
<br />
Overall it is a darn great finale for the adaptation of the third part of the JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventrue manga. It left me completely satisfied and I really hope they will keep adapting the manga into more seasons of anime. After all the next part: Part 4 Diamond is Unbreakable is really great.

    The JoJo series is a very peculiar beast, one ridden with overly muscular super humans, flamboyantly stunning poses, and over-the-top battles that are sure to fill your battle shounen needs. All of these elements are turned up to 11 for Part 3, also known as Stardust Crusaders. While the first season of Stardust Crusaders helped get the ball rolling, the second season had me fully invested, excitedly awaiting my dose of weekly JoJo tomfoolery and badassery.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, I&#039;ve yet to read or watch Part 1 and 2 of JoJo(as of writing this review) [Update: Caught up through Part 4 of the anime - JoJo fever is

        in full effect]. I know that seems to throw my merit right out the door, but let me explain! Last year I was in the heat of my anime-watching routine, picking up almost every seasonal show, in an attempt to expand my knowledge of anime and stay up-to-date with current favorites. This of course, was not an easy task, as I quickly drowned in a sea of anime, unable to find enough reason in my wavering heart to drop the shows I only saw as &#039;okay&#039;. Thus, I became entrapped in a vicious cycle of show-binging, simply to keep up with everything else. But there are always a few diamonds in the rough, and one exceptional outlier starred a highschool boy with the physique of an Olympic athlete and a hat that formed a union with his hair.<br />
<br />
JoJo gave me quite the entertaining first impression. The art style and character designs were immediately reminiscent of Fist of the North Star, which was a refreshing difference from the copy-paste character designs I was getting from many other shows on-air. The story arc had been laid out plain and simple within the first few episodes, and while it was nothing exceptionally captivating, I knew already that JoJo was going to be about the journey, not the destination. Week after week, each battle became more and more preposterous, adding new levels of insanity to every consequent duel. JoJo had revealed to me its true nature - it was an outrageous satire of anime past, showcasing every lame catchphrase and ridiculous character tropes from the likes of Fist of the North Star coincidentally. While it was a satire, what made JoJo stand out was its ability to be a really freakin&#039; well-made satire. Catchphrases were cheesy, but hilarious, fight scenes were ludicrous, but thrilling nonetheless. It didn&#039;t take long for me to jump on the JoJo train, and soon I couldn&#039;t survive the week without seeing their silly, well-toned faces.<br />
<br />
Skip to the beginning of 2015. The year has begun anew, and soon to follow suit, another season of JoJo was about to begin. Jotaro and his fellow Stardust Crusaders, Avdol, Kakyoin, Polnareff, Joseph, and Iggy had finally made it to Egypt, the location of their decisive battle against the fabulously immortal vampire Dio. With the majority of the plot setup and character introductions behind us, all that lie ahead was non-stop Stand-on-Stand action. An issue of pacing can arise with a formula built around weekly showdowns (some special one’s made into 2-parters), but Stardust Crusaders handles this excellently with its colorful main cast and a plethora of unique enemies who stand in their way. The Crusaders themselves are one of the best groups I’ve seen in an action show for the past few seasons (I’m looking at you, Kirito and your harem brigade). Each one has distinct personalities and quirks that make their interactions with one another pure gold. <br />
<br />
Jotaro retains the role of the tough-guy school delinquent, but he’s so physically and mentally calm and collected, that he doesn’t come off as an idiot, which is much appreciated for that type of character. His super-serious attitude can even be hilarious if given the right comedic timing. Joseph Joestar returns quite a bit older from his role in Battle Tendency, but his childish nature still shines through. Joseph is quite the card, responsible for some of the funniest moments in Stardust Crusaders; his infamous “OH MY GOD” engrish reactions are priceless. Muhammad Avdol is very serious and a bit of a caretaker to the rest of the irresponsible adventurers. He acts as a guide and cultural resource for the Joestars as they make their trek through the Middle East. Noriaki Kakyoin is a fellow student of Jotaro’s, and also one of the more serious characters, but he is also very genuine, showing signs of compassion several times throughout the journey. Jean Pierre Polnareff is the unsung hero of Stardust Crusaders, getting just about or maybe even more screen time than even the Joestars. Polnareff is your typical loud-mouth hero, who isn’t afraid to speak his mind and emote as much as he deems appropriate. But underneath his clumsy exterior is a very protective, and passionate warrior. Possibly the most complex of the bunch, his screen time is adequate in proportion to the amount of character development he needed. Lastly there’s Iggy, an abrasive dog, frequently acting on his own accord and staying relatively antisocial. While he is supposed to be with the Crusaders to aid their struggle, he seems to be more of an annoyance, especially to Polnareff, whom Iggy consistently enjoyed terrorizing. Iggy’s worth to the team comes out in small spurts at first, both consciously and unconsciously saving the group without them realizing it most of the time. This is a grade-A main cast, and Stardust Crusaders does each one justice by allotting specific episodic battle to each of them pretty equally, though I wouldn’t have complained if Kakyoin and Avdol got a little more time up front.<br />
<br />
Even more entertaining than our heroes is the variety of enemies they face along the way. Perhaps the most enthralling part of JoJo is waiting to see what the next Stand user was going to throw at the Crusaders. There’s basically no limit to the concept of a Stand, so the amount of possible Stands and users is practically endless. We follow the Crusaders as they face a cursed sword who makes a master out of its wielder, wager their souls against a conniving high stakes gambler, and even duke it out with a Stand-using orangutan. If there is one thing JoJo creator Hirohiko Araki does exceptionally well, it is character creation. Every battle felt fresh and exciting. The fights themselves were also very distinct in how they played out. The Oingo Boingo twins clumsily stumbled through their failed Jotaro assassination attempt, which was one of the funniest episodes in the series. On the other hand, the crew’s battle with the High Priestess in the submarine was exhilarating and had me on the edge of my seat. And of course it’s hard to forget the illusionary obstacle created by the Sun Stand, which once figured out, was quickly and amusingly disposed of. While many of them were one-off characters, momentary obstacles only to be replaced in the following episode, a lot of the enemies were very well written and designed, and I found a lot of the charm in JoJo could be discovered through attachments created to these short-lived villains.<br />
<br />
While I am fond of the macho-man aesthetic of the JoJo universe, it wasn’t the only artistic choice I was keen on observing. The palette swap during some intense fight scenes became a standard affair during the show. The psychedelic color schemes that embodied these moments were a great addition to atmosphere building, the pastel colors representing a state of confusion, letting the viewer know that something quite perplexing was at hand. The use of ‘unsound effects’ such as the words “menacing” drifting across the screen are a delightful nod to the manga, and has equal effectiveness in setting up the tone of upcoming showdowns. The show’s direction is on-point during battle sequences, as if each character were aware of their on-screen close-up, they assume theatrically stylish poses as they outwit their opponent. Dramatic pans to full character stitches are expectedly followed up with brief attack explanations or memorable one-liners, avoiding exhaustingly drawn-out details and replacing them with fast paced, concisely explained sequences. Not a moment feels wasted during the show’s combat, keeping my attention indefinitely, eyes glued to the screen the entire time.<br />
<br />
One element of Stardust Crusaders that caught me completely off guard was the quality of the show’s OP’s and ED’s. All four songs are littered with hints about events that occur throughout the season, making their replay value astronomically high; each watch possibly revealing a detail you didn’t catch the previous time. The 3D rendered characters from the OP’s look as if they’ve jumped straight out of JoJo’s All Star Battle videogame; their designs are sleek, and animation is fluid. Both OP’s are successful at instilling hype for each forthcoming episode, especially the special versions of the OP that appear in the last few episodes. While the OP’s can effectively get the blood flowing, the ED’s take a surprisingly relaxed approach. The use of American bands for both songs was a perfect fit for the reference-centric JoJo universe, as Araki is fairly well-known for naming his characters after American musicians. The first song, “Walk Like an Egyptian” by The Bangles is a fairly obvious choice, but an excellent one nonetheless. The second ED choice was much more abstract, but all the more welcomed. “Last Train Home” by Pat Metheny Group is a sobering melody, a lone guitar howls as night falls and our heroes make their grand departure. While the song seems a bit unfit for the episodes that ended with sweat-inducing cliffhangers, it’s the perfect conclusion for some of the more heartfelt episodes, and flawlessly wraps up the season. With this perilous journey behind the Crusaders, “Last Train Home” embodies their peace of mind, leaving a final fleeting moment for reflection and remembrance of the trials they’ve overcome and the memories they’ve made together. (Fun fact: The ED “Last Train Home” introduced me to the wonderful jazz fusion of Pat Metheney, who I have since grown fond of, and I now own a vinyl of his first album, which has “Last Train Home” on it.)<br />
<br />
Upon completing Stardust Crusaders, I originally gave it an 8, and began my reviewing process. But after further consideration, and as my review neared its end, I had several realizations which led me to bump my score up to a 9. I realize now that I had ZERO expectations going into JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. Having no prior knowledge of its existence and setting no standards for what lie ahead, I was completely blown away by the end of Part 3. An anime I had picked up without a second thought had quickly become one of my favorite shows of the year. Even for the veteran JoJo fan’s Part 3 was handled with extreme care. David Productions really went all out; from the music, to animation, to voice acting, it’s obvious that everyone involved with the project took it to heart, and their collective effort gave us the spectacular escapade that is Stardust Crusaders. <br />
<br />
And now, it’s about time I catch up on Part 1 and 2. ORA ORA ORA!!!	<br />

    The story<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
The story of Stardust Crusaders is very good, but in the anime, they make it too long, but I want to talk about it in the enjoyment section. <br />
<br />
I believe the ending is the finest of every animated part yet. From the beginning of Dio&#039;s World will feel something you never felt before about this series. <br />
<br />
Art<br />
10/10<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want to talk a lot about the art of this part, it&#039;s just very good I don&#039;t see any problem with it.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
The characters are just great. Jotaro has way more depth than Jonathan or Joseph and Dio&#039;s motivation is better (if you read part 6 you&#039;ll

          <span style="display: none;" id="review371682">
        understand it better, part 3 Dio with the part 6 explanation is a masterpiece)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Because the anime is, for me at least, way too long for the original story. Besides that, the fights do not roll the story forward, but they are great at least. <br />
<br />
Overall<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
This is the best part of the first 3 parts mainly because of the ending. <br />
The way Jotaro defeats Dio is a bit lame for me, but I know Araki desided it in the beginning and it can be explained, but after all at the end of the day it&#039;s a great part of the series and I highly recommend it.

    Yes, it is my first time writing a review, but I feel like I really needed to for this series.<br />
<br />
I got into JoJo not too long ago mainly because of everyone telling me to watch it, and i so far do not regret it. But, this review will only be on the Part 3 of the series as it was the one who made me feel that way so I could write the review. <br />
<br />
The story, as someone already mentioned gets repetitive after a while, since all of the enemy stand user encounters are basically the same and end in the same way. While I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333343">
        agree to the statement I do also feel like the encounters while repetitive, were needed for both character development and the story it self. That is the reason why the story for me is a 7/10. It&#039;s not the best, but it is also not the worst. In my opinion it has it&#039;s ups and lows.<br />
<br />
The art is something unique to JoJo itself. Which I think made the whole series so different and more enjoyable. There really is nothing much to say about this point, you can clearly see the art from the memes if you still haven&#039;t watched the series yet. For me it&#039;s a 10/10<br />
<br />
Sound was amazing. The OST&#039;s were fitting, effects did not seem out of place, and both openings and endings are extremely good too. Part 3 openings are my favourite ones. (Yes I listened to all of the parts before saying this.) I am someone who enjoys music on a different level, and JoJo had my style of music. So personally this is also a 10/10<br />
<br />
Characters were also unique to JoJo. Mainly because of the art style, but I really like that the series gives every character a chance, and they get their time to shine. Every character makes sense, plays their own role in the story perfectly and never seems out of place. The character development in this series is insane too. Even the characters that seem useless, do not do much or get killed and forgotten quick still play their importance to the fullest. This gets a 10/10 from me. This may be biased too, since I really fucks with Jotaro&#039;s character. So take this one with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
Overall, I give it a 10/10. I do not care if anyone will think differently, I&#039;m not telling you that this show is a 10/10. I&#039;m telling you my opinion. This series made me feel something different, I felt like a kid again who watched Dragon Ball everyday after school, getting hype at epic moments, feeling emotion while watching something. Of course, most of the anime I watch makes me feel some sort of way, gets some emotion out of me. But this was different. I can&#039;t possibly string enough words that would fit right now to describe how I feel. I am writing this minutes after watching the last episode of Part 3, and I do not feel like my opinion will change. This has inspired me and motivated me in a lot of ways. Therefore I am thankful for this.

    The second half of Part 3? Hell yeah. <br />
<br />
Story: 10/10 <br />
<br />
The climatic finale of JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders, we went to Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Pakistan, Arabia, crossed the Red Sea and finally made it to the place were we wanted to go from the start of our journey, Egypt. The second season to Part 3 Stardust Crusaders is one of the most satisfying conclusions to any JoJo Part and many Shounen series out there, we continue following our fellow crusaders across the Nile and finally arrive at Cairo in Egypt, stardust crusaders 2nd season is one of the best JoJo parts around and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354786">
        is a greatly satisfying conclusion to the Brando and Joestar rivalry, but does it hold up as well today as it did 1989 or when it was first released in the U.S back in 2005, well if you couldn&#039;t guess by know, of course part 3 is the best part of JoJo to date (in my humble opinion) and is the most iconic JJBA part to bath Japanese and Western fans.<br />
<br />
Stardust crusaders 2nd season picks up right after the fight with &#039;High Priestess&#039; in the Red Sea, as they emerge from the water they are greeted to the warm Egyptian sun and are now ready for the next step of the journey, with the addition of Iggy to the crusaders, the crusaders make there way through the river Nile and after fighting many enemies along the way finally reach Cairo were they are to soon meet DIO and fight him first in his mansion and then in the streets of Cairo. *now warning ahead of time for me to explain why I love Stardust crusaders I&#039;m going to spoil some of the fight between DIO and Jotaro so when you see the spoiler warning feel free to skip ahead* Now the battle in Egypt is probably the best JoJo arc of all time, unlike the villains in the first half of the Part, most of the villains here are more memorable than say someone like Steely Dan or Wheel of fortune, we have classic villains such as pro gamers D&#039;Arby the player and D&#039;Arby the pro gamer, Vanilla ice and pet shop, the story consistently kept me engaged to the end and almost brought me to tears at the end, the journey was satisfying and really emphasized the ending and made us care for the characters and world.<br />
<br />
*----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----*<br />
<br />
The fight between DIO and Jotaro is one of the most fitting and satisfying endings of all time, DIO was an incredibly fun and vibrant villain with a great and terrifying stand, The World&#039;s ability to stop time was a great task to overcome and made the ending even more satisfying, leading up to the fight between DIO and Jotaro, the deaths of Iggy, Avdol and Kakyoin were some of the saddest deaths in all of JoJo, and for a time being I had even fought Joesph was dead, Josephs final advice to Jotaro is one of the most thematically fitting moments and was an incredibly touching scene, Jotaro&#039;s growth as a person in stardust crusaders was something that was really noticed by many, but seeing the influence DIO, Joseph, Avdol, Kakyoin, Polnarref and Iggy had on him as a person to shape who he was in the future is something that is often skipped over, DIO vs Jotaro is a fitting end to a century spanning saga and is one of the best JoJo parts ever.<br />
<br />
*----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----*<br />

Art: 10/10 <br />
<br />
The animation once again done by David Production is back and holy crap with the more tenser Stand battles means the animation is all the more grander and amazing, they still have the changing color palette making almost every scene or frame interesting and NOT for us to look away from the screen. <br />
<br />
Backgrounding, character designs, fight scenes and the absolute consistency of the animation is just amazing and DP will mention they keep this up for 24 episodes, it&#039;s nothing but a mark of animation brilliance to say the least and let&#039;s not even get to Dio&#039;s fight as THAT was glorious. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10 <br />
<br />
Voice acting has the same voice cast back but with Misato Fukuen as Iggy...yeah confused?, Iggy has his own monologue with woof outside it so there is that. I will quite easily say the best performances of Part 3 is... Takehito Koyasu and Daisuke Ono as Dio and Jotaro respectively... I just had to, third runner up would be Unshou Ishizuka as Joseph as he still my favorite character...until Jotaro and Dio&#039;s fight then...Takehito Koyasu. <br />
<br />
The OST for SDC is probably one of the strongest points. The intros, Stand Proud and Sono Chi No Kioku having amazing animations and are just great songs in general. They&#039;ll be stuck in your head for a long time. The sound design is very good too, the sound effects that come with Star Platinum&#039;s punches are all satisfying. <br />
<br />
*----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----*<br />
<br />
When DIO&#039;s stand, the World, activates it&#039;s time stop there&#039;s another amazing sound effect that sounds like, for lack of a better explanation, wubs from a dubstep song.<br />
<br />
*----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----*<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10 <br />
<br />
Jotaro retains the role of the tough-guy school delinquent, but he’s so physically and mentally calm and collected, that he doesn’t come off as an idiot, which is much appreciated for that type of character. His super-serious attitude can even be hilarious if given the right comedic timing. Joseph Joestar returns quite a bit older from his role in Battle Tendency, but his childish nature still shines through. Joseph is quite the card, responsible for some of the funniest moments in Stardust Crusaders; his infamous “OH MY GOD” engrish reactions are priceless. Muhammad Avdol is very serious and a bit of a caretaker to the rest of the irresponsible adventurers. He acts as a guide and cultural resource for the Joestars as they make their trek through the Middle East. Noriaki Kakyoin is a fellow student of Jotaro’s, and also one of the more serious characters, but he is also very genuine, showing signs of compassion several times throughout the journey. Jean Pierre Polnareff is the unsung hero of Stardust Crusaders, getting just about or maybe even more screen time than even the Joestars. Polnareff is your typical loud-mouth hero, who isn’t afraid to speak his mind and emote as much as he deems appropriate. But underneath his clumsy exterior is a very protective, and passionate warrior. Possibly the most complex of the bunch, his screen time is adequate in proportion to the amount of character development he needed. Lastly there’s Iggy, an abrasive dog, frequently acting on his own accord and staying relatively antisocial. While he is supposed to be with the Crusaders to aid their struggle, he seems to be more of an annoyance, especially to Polnareff, whom Iggy consistently enjoyed terrorizing. Iggy’s worth to the team comes out in small spurts at first, both consciously and unconsciously saving the group without them realizing it most of the time. This is a grade-A main cast, and Stardust Crusaders does each one justice by allotting specific episodic battle to each of them pretty equally, though I wouldn’t have complained if Kakyoin and Avdol got a little more time up front.<br />
<br />
Even more entertaining than our heroes is the variety of enemies they face along the way. Perhaps the most enthralling part of JoJo is waiting to see what the next Stand user was going to throw at the Crusaders. There’s basically no limit to the concept of a Stand, so the amount of possible Stands and users is practically endless. We follow the Crusaders as they face a cursed sword who makes a master out of its wielder, wager their souls against a conniving high stakes gambler, and even duke it out with a Stand-using orangutan. If there is one thing JoJo creator Hirohiko Araki does exceptionally well, it is character creation. Every battle felt fresh and exciting. The fights themselves were also very distinct in how they played out. The Oingo Boingo twins clumsily stumbled through their failed Jotaro assassination attempt, which was one of the funniest episodes in the series. On the other hand, the crew’s battle with the High Priestess in the submarine was exhilarating and had me on the edge of my seat. And of course it’s hard to forget the illusionary obstacle created by the Sun Stand, which once figured out, was quickly and amusingly disposed of. While many of them were one-off characters, momentary obstacles only to be replaced in the following episode, a lot of the enemies were very well written and designed, and I found a lot of the charm in JoJo could be discovered through attachments created to these short-lived villains. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10 <br />
<br />
Upon completing the Tarot Arc of Stardust Crusaders, I originally gave it an 9, and began my reviewing process. But after further consideration, and as my review neared its end, I had several realizations which led me to bump my score up to a 10. I realize now that I had ZERO expectations going into JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. I was completely blown away by the end of Part 3. An anime I had picked up without a second thought had quickly become one of my favorite shows of the year. Even for the veteran JoJo fan’s Part 3 was handled with extreme care. David Productions really went all out; from the music, to animation, to voice acting, it’s obvious that everyone involved with the project took it to heart, and their collective effort gave us the spectacular escapade that is Stardust Crusaders. <br />
<br />
If you are desperate for an escape from the same generic harem Isekai or half-assed slice of life every season, JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure is the anime for you. <br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10

    I believe this is the moment on part 3 that the typical episodes of encountering new stand users get interesting, especially since some are much stronger and their stands are more creative. <br />
<br />
We now get more personal with the characters that at first we didn&#039;t know about at the start of the season, and everything is made so perfectly so we understand things to a certain level.<br />
<br />
The only thing I found lacking was some emotions from the characters, especially Jotaro although he&#039;s super cool and well developed.<br />
<br />
I decided to give this a 10/10 mainly because of the last 4 episodes, which were amazing.

    Jojo&#039;s bizarre adventure stardust crusaders climactic finale, we went to Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Pakistan, Arabia, crossed the Red Sea and finally made it to the place were we wanted to go from the start of our journey, Egypt. The second season to part 3 stardust crusaders is the most satisfying conclusion to any Jojo part and many shonen series out there, we continue following our fellow crusaders across the Nile and finally arrive at Cairo in Egypt, stardust crusaders 2nd season is one of the best jojo parts around and is a greatly satisfying conclusion to the Brando and Joestar rivalry, but does it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322460">
        hold up as well today as it did 1989 or when it was first released in the U.S back in 2005, well if you couldn&#039;t guess by know, of course part 3 is the best part of JoJo to date (in my humble opinion) and is the most iconic JJBA part to bath Japanese and Western fans.<br />
<br />
Stardust crusaders 2nd season picks up right after the fight with &#039;High Priestess&#039; in the Red Sea, as they emerge from the water they are greeted to the warm Egyptian sun and are now ready for the next step of the journey, with the addition of Iggy to the crusaders, the crusaders make there way through the river Nile and after fighting many enemies along the way finally reach Cairo were they are to soon meet Dio and fight him first in his mansion and then in the streets of Cairo. *now warning ahead of time for me to explain why I love Stardust crusaders I&#039;m going to spoil some of the fight between Dio and Jotaro so when you see the spoiler warning feel free to skip ahead* Now the battle in Egypt is probably the best JoJo arc of all time, unlike the villains in the first half of the Part, most of the villains here are more memorable than say someone like Steely dan or Wheel of fortune, we have classic villains such as pro gamers D&#039;Arby the player and D&#039;Arby the pro gamer, Vanilla ice and pet shop, the Storie consistently kept me engaged to the end and almost brought me to tears at the end, the journey was satisfying and really emphasised the ending and made us care for the characters and world. <br />
<br />
*----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----*<br />
<br />
The fight between Dio and Jotaro is one of the most fitting and satisfying endings of all time, Dio was an incredibly fun and vibrant villain with a great and terrifying stand, the worlds ability to stop time was a great task to overcome and made the ending even more satisfying, leading up to the fight between Dio and Jotaro, the deaths of Iggy, Avdol and Kakyoin were some of the saddest deaths in all of jojo, and for a time being I had even fought Joesph was dead, Josephs final advice to Jotaro is one of the most thematically fitting moments and was an incredibly touching scene, Jotaros Growth as a person in stardust crusaders was something that was really noticed by many, but seeing the influence dio, Joseph, Avdol, Kakyoin, Polnarref and Iggy had on him as a person to shape who he was in the future is something that is often skipped over, DIo vs Jotaro is a fitting end to a century spanning saga and is one of the best Jojo parts ever. <br />
<br />
*----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----**----SPOILER----*<br />
<br />
The art as usual was amazing Hirohiko Araki&#039;s distinctive art style was made perfectly into the anime and was great to see, the use of colour theory in Part 3 was great and the visual metaphors were mostly hidden in the amazing openings. The character designs were memorable and creative and were easily recognisable. <br />
<br />
The music on the 2nd season was great Last Train Home as the ed was in my opinion the perfect choice the title of the song to the visuals to the song itself were perfect for the story, the opening Sono Chio Kioku was brilliant packed with subtle meanings, references and stunning visuals. The Ost while great stayed mostly the same.<br />
<br />
The characters had clearly changed over the series and that was seen clearly through mainly Polnareff and Jotaro, they were definitely the chapters that changed the most in there time with the crusaders, other then that the characters were still great and enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Overall Stardust crusaders is and immensely enjoyable and great JoJo part.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading <br />
<br />
Yours sincerely, Platinum crusader!

    This is one of the most awesome anime ever created. <br />
What an adventure. A story of true friendship and fight against evil in its purest form.<br />
<br />
The villain Dio is probably one of the most greatest villains ever created. Dio is so perfect,that anyone can fall for his handsome looks and charm.When he talks even the most bravest of heroes can&#039;t move,that&#039;s how he traps them and gets control over them.No one can stop Dio, and he will rule the world. He has many faithful servants that are willing to die for him and are equally evil, as he is. <br />
<br />
But, he needs one thing and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306123">
        one thing only.<br />
To destroy the Joestars once and for all.<br />
<br />
Joseph and his grandson Jotaro need to destroy Dio in order to save Holy. So the mission begins. If you think the Hamon power was cool, wait till you see the Stand Power, because it&#039;s the coolest thing you&#039;ll ever see. There are many different stands, all interesting in their own way. <br />
<br />
The designs of these stands and the story behind each and every one of them, is just a joy to watch. Entertainment at its highest level. Leaving you wanting more after each episode.The excitement never ends! Full of crazy horror bloody scenes, filled with ton of comedy and joy.<br />
With a lot of mystery and anticipation what the next stand will be like. <br />
<br />
The old hag stand was so spooky, but when she talks and screams of her revenge, those scenes with Polnareff leave you laughing to the point where, your neighbors will hear you. The dog Iggy will become your favorite after you get to know him better in one of the most amazing episodes ever created, when he encounters an evil guardian. <br />
<br />
The episode when they play games is so much fun, when Jotaro takes of his hat and the old man screaming at him the whole time, because Jotaro doesn&#039;t even know how to play the baseball game. Just so much fun.<br />
<br />
In this anime every episode has a story on its own, but always connected to the main plot. Bringing new and exiting characters who all have great original stand powers. Most anime would drag one simple story throughout the whole Season, but not this one. Stardust Crusaders Season 1 and 2 gives you so much more. You are left with a feeling of getting to know so many characters and their own stories.<br />
<br />
Overall this adventure is such a rich, powerful, creative, heartwarming story. It will make you laugh,cry, be amazed, and cheer for our heroes. <br />
<br />
(OMG!!!!!! I cant forget to mention such style, such fashion and such perfect hairstyles!!!! Such muscles! A girl can just gush over these things lol )<br />
<br />
GOOD GRIEF. <br />
<br />
P.S. The old man&#039;s Sony Walkman looks exactly like my Sony Walkman...Just one of the little details, that makes it so damn nostalgic for me.

    &quot;When life gives you Hirohiko Araki, you watch Jojo.&quot;<br />
-Youtube Commenter<br />
<br />
The Climax of the Stardust Crusader arc, or the Egypt arc of part 3. Using David Production close to source faithful adaptation of the hit 1993 manga of the same name can be summed up in three words:<br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
This anime of the manga is great. The plot is straightforward, the art is nostalgic, and the music track.<br />
<br />
My god, the music track.<br />
<br />
If you want to have a break from all the current generation art-style and some old balls to the walls action pack anime with a very bizarre, yet entertaining adventure, this anime is for you.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190716">
        We got vampires, dashing old man, and most of all, Friendship.<br />
<br />
I give this anime a 10/10<br />
<br />
Very biased, of course.

    Stardust Crusaders is by far my favourite JoJo Part so far, especially the 2nd half of it.<br />
<br />
JoJo has a very simple concept that I usually don&#039;t enjoy that much. Every episode deals with another seemingly random antagonist without personality that needs to be defeated to get to the final boss. Now this is something that has definitely annoyed me in Part 4 and especially in Part 5, but Part 3 is in my opinion the only part which actually manages to make every episode very compelling and fun to watch.<br />
Out of 48 episodes in total there are maybe 3 or 4 episodes that I didn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409631">
        like that much. The fights and abilities are super interesting, the antagonists get outsmarted in entertaining and bizarre yet understandable ways and the relative simplicity of the Crusaders&#039; Stands is relaxing and easy to watch for a journey that long.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves aren&#039;t specifically deep except for Polnareff, but you definitely find yourself quite attached to them, especially when watching the finale. Dio as a villain might be loved by many, but I&#039;m not a fan of him since he is literally just there being evil. He has somewhat of a personality by being manipulative and cocky, but those are common traits among villains so it&#039;s really nothing special. He did make for an amazing final fight though.<br />
<br />
The thing that makes Stardust Crusaders my favourite JoJo Part is probably the storywriting. Out of the animated Parts it is by far the best, even if it&#039;s not great compared to other anime. There is a set journey with a clear goal right from the beginning and the multiple casual scenes in between fights allow you to grow attached to the group. It truly feels like you yourself are on a journey with the Crusaders. The setting is amazing as well, it&#039;s very rare to see these countries in anime (or in any media) so it immediately has a very unique feeling and charme.<br />
Despite its episodic structure, Stardust Crusaders always feels like a connected journey with a clear goal to reach.<br />
<br />
That aside, JoJo Part 3 has without a doubt the best ending I have ever seen in anime or in any series in general. The final few episodes are absolutely shocking, emotional, epic and full of suspense. The ending is very bittersweet but perfectly written for a story that brutal and unforgiving and leaves you sobbing like a baby. This is where I noticed how much the characters had actually grown on me.<br />
<br />
All in all, Stardust Crusaders is animated JoJo at its peak and definitely worth the time, despite some of the series&#039; general issues.

    Another part/season of Jojo completed and added to the books! Let&#039;s get right into the anime basics.<br />
<br />
*** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ***<br />
Story; Carrying on from Stardust Crusaders 1st season, or cast of characters finally find themselves in Egypt getting closer to DIO... but of course, getting to him won&#039;t be easy because what&#039;s the fun in that? Follow the gang as they fight against new stand users, get into lot&#039;s of trouble and finally fight Dio on his turf. ARGH, this season was just as good as the last!!! I loved following the Jojo&#039;s and they&#039;re wonderful friends along this journey, and I&#039;ll also miss the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review372289">
        hell out of them *cries in weeb*. Art; Just as fantastic as the last season. Sound; This has been the only OST so far that I haven&#039;t 100% loved. I honestly hated it at first, I thought it didn&#039;t suit their Egyptian adventures at all... but my wishy washy heart always changes it mind by the end! The opening during the last two episodes, the sad ass &quot;Last train home&quot; song gave me so much emotion, uurrrghhhh. Characters; We got to learn a lot of the main cast during this season, and you always knew when their time was up when you got to learn a little about their past (my beautiful boy Kakyouin, RIP I LOVE YOU).<br />
<br />
Overall, I really enjoyed this season and I&#039;m sad it came to an end so fast... Some part of me wishes they did the last few minutes a bit differently (maybe show a bit more of the future... ya know, maybe see if Jotaru ends up with anyone and continues the Jojo bloodline?!) but the parting between the three of them and showing a happy Holly and a cute as picture of everyone of the flight satisfied me as well. &lt;&lt;&lt;333

    This review will contain spoilers for JoJo Stardust Crusaders 2nd Season:<br />
<br />
Story : 8<br />
The story remained to the monster of the week style and the story sometimes felt repetitive, but this was never a problem as the fights kept things fresh. JoJo also continues to use smart ways to fight opponents. The story got a lot better when the gang reaches DIO’s mansion<br />
Sound: 10<br />
The sound design for JoJo has always been unique. Whether DIO’s stopping time sound effect, which has basically become the staple of time stopping to the gunshot sound effect of a punch. The sound design for this season is still top tier.<br />
<br />
Characters: 9<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review393069">
        characters for stardust crusaders continue to be as good as they were in the first season and it is really enjoyable to watch.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9 <br />
Overall this season was very enjoyable. The fights and stands felt more creative than the first season.<br />

Overall: 9<br />

    So P.3 in JoJo is my favorite part that has got an anime adaption and i realy like the second season so here is a review.<br />
Story 9/10 the story is pretty repetetive at this point bit i can’t conplain because Dio is in it more!<br />
Art 10/10 it’s fucking JoJo so the art is amazing.<br />
Sound 10/10 the op is a banger and all the ed’s are bangers. The voice is amazing but especially Ayumi Fujimura’s voice acting of Polnareff is so good Takehito Koyashu is amazing (as always) and all the other voice acting is amazing.<br />

    If I liked how it ended? : YES! YES! YES! <br />
Am I lying? NO! NO! NO! <br />
<br />
<br />
in practice it was like: the story continued frantic with struggle with each new episode, again being a pattern that doesn&#039;t get boring, and it only makes you want to see the anime even more, with the addition at the end with the battle against KONO DIO!. some important points for me were the deaths of characters as beloved as avdol (a great man) and the kakyoin that even though he was a little forgotten had his deserved shine.And also, iggy. Jojo managed to be incredible enough to introduce

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382197">
        me to a dog with a stand, to show an incredible fight and how proud and valued this companion can be (I cried). it ended with a tone of farewell satisfaction and a fresh start. the melancholy that this end of such an intense clash brought me further motivated me to continue watching this work of art.<br />
<br />
Opening art, of the characters, fights remains impeccable as always. It deserves one more point for the closure of the brothers oingo and boing, with even another version of this one made with Hol Horse instead of oingo . It&#039;s bizarre, or it&#039;s Jojo.<br />
<br />
flawless ost :D<br />
<br />
Polnareff remains the best secondary character, a balance between humor, pride, serious moments, and breathtaking battles, with a very strong consideration and ties with the joestar group, the his final fight against ice vanilla was very emotional and full of feelings, Be it thanks or sadness <br />
DIO! It is simply someone who is cursed but who has a charisma and personality,That makes you like him in some way Za warudo (Tummm or Dummm, the halt time effect haha)<br />
<br />
I took advantage of everything that Jojo can provide from bonds between friends to funny scenes or epic fights,There is no way not to laugh with the brothers in the strange notebook, or not to like to hear Dio speak the world while fighting or jotaro with now and now, besides being moved by the departure of our companions Of screen <br />
<br />
9 Or up to 10 if you play

    Jojo Bizarre Adventure Part 3: Second Season is pretty much the same thing that you experienced in the first season, however unlike the first season where practically every episode the group had a new enemy to fight, on this season they basically put 2 episodes for each new enemy, which makes the pace of the episodes much better than the first season.<br />
<br />
This new enemies are bland though - just like the first season -, unlike before where the Stands were based on Tarot Cards, now the enemies are related  to the Egyptian Gods that, for some reason, are the origin of the Tarot Cards?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340505">
        I didn&#039;t get that and it seems like they threw the idea away just as quickly as it was shown, another thing that was thrown was the Egyptian Mythology behind each stand. Earlier Stands this season were somewhat related to the Egyptian Mythology, but as the episodes progressed they stopped making sense - this might be nitpicking, but why use the Egyptian Mythology then, it is clear to me that the creator doesn&#039;t give much thought on building the story and he writes  as he goes, something that could be noticed by now, when he either discard OP powers or he introduce news powers that could have been convenient in earlier episodes.<br />
<br />
The story is the same thing again, the group is still trying to find Dio to solve  Holly&#039;s problem and only later on we are given a &quot;reason&quot; of why Dio wasn&#039;t taking care of the problem himself, and if you noticed the author writing you won&#039;t be satisfied by the reason given by Dio.<br />
<br />
Our protagonists continue to be as deep as a puddle, Jotaro wears the thickest plot armour, Joseph is still a clown, Polnareff after his interesting motives on season one became a bland character, Kakyoin is a smart guy but we don&#039;t get to see his wits often, Avdol is 50/50 the author seemed to  want to change his character a bit, but other times his changes disappear, Iggy is a new character that has no development whatsoever, only later on the author decides to develop him but it was too late, meanwhile you will only see him farting on Polnareff&#039;s face.<br />
<br />
Jojo is a series that is quite popular, but its popularity doesn&#039;t reflect quality overall, its  story is poor, superficial and even dumb.

    A Full Review of JJBA Stardust Crusaders - Battle in Egypt (ep. 1 - 24): <br />
<br />
In Stardust Crusaders&#039; Battle in Egypt, it is the new characters in the story that enabled more opportunities for better comedic scenes than compared to its previous one. The story continues on with the four men and a dog finally reaching Egypt in order to face Dio. This is not limited to the new set of interesting stand users they had to approach before Dio. Their various encounters with other stand users thankfully ended up being very entertaining, especially for adult audiences, which Araki (manga&#039;s author and artist), clearly knows

          <span style="display: none;" id="review375120">
        how to poke fun in many of those bizarre situations. <br />
<br />
Story: 8  <br />
The story (inspired by French author Jules Verne&#039;s adventure novel &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;) consists of the mens&#039; 50 day journey to Egypt, where their main objective is to save Holly and destroy Dio&#039;s intergenerational &quot;curse&quot; after Jonathan&#039;s passing. Even when the purpose of the story is simple, in my view, the funny scenes takes precedence either way. There are also a few emotional scenes that mostly has to do with Polnareff. I found these particular scenes to be a relieving factor especially after usual action-packed scenes in the anime. This is because you are able to empathize with the character in a more personal level. Personally, I wish they had more emotional and personal scenes like that, which you&#039;ll definitely get to see more in the next parts of JoJo to come.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
The reason why Araki&#039;s character art style is particularly interesting is due to it being incredibly dynamic. What used to be characters with thicker outlines in Part 1, changed to round and unblemished faces in Part 2. Part 3 emerges to having an improved and contoured bold appearance. It is the men&#039;s sharper jawlines and longer face structure that makes them the appearance that they look sturdy enough to withstand the long journey. Since the anime takes place in Egypt, the ethnic features and cultural garments of these new characters were accurately detailed, making the viewers feel immersed in Egyptian culture along the way. In addition to this, the various stand designs and powers prevent these characters from being repetitive and boring during these episodes. In regards to JoJo&#039;s OP and ED, Part 3 was the last of the OPs that was animated in 3D that to me felt more fluid than the latest ones. It is like a trademark of JoJo to have an SFX version of their OPs at their final episodes of the anime. In the SFX version of the OP, you realize that certain scenes in the animation correlates to the events that are to take place later in the final episodes. An example of this, without having to spoil much, is the revelation of Dio&#039;s stand power. It is the great attention to detail that makes me praise David Production for being clever in what they do.       <br />

The second opening, &quot;JoJo Sono Chi no Kioku ~end of THE WORLD~&quot; sung by the previous singers of Part 1 and 2 (Hiroaki &quot;TOMMY&quot; Tominaga, Coda, and Jin Hashimoto as the JO☆STARS) was an interesting choice. Although I found the melody composition slightly chaotic, I wouldn&#039;t blame the composers as it is a suitable song for the likes of JoJo. The &quot;Ora ora&quot; part at the end of the song is an example of the weird knacks the anime possesses. The second opening, &quot;Last Train Home&quot; from American jazz band Pat Metheny Group, was contrasted to the roaring sound of the opening, instead it ends the anime with a calmer feeling. The user&#039;s stand sound profiles make the anime&#039;s action scenes stand out even better. For example, the memorable stand sound profiles of Dio&#039;s &quot;MUDA, MUDA, MUDA!&quot; counteracting with Jotaro&#039;s &quot;ORA, ORA, ORA!&quot; is probably most bizarre thing I&#039;ve ever heard. You could also hear this in the SFX version of the OP, where the producers added the small but clever detail of Dio&#039;s stand in relation to the sound of the clock striking. <br />

Character: 8<br />
What&#039;s particularly notable about Stardust Crusaders&#039; Battle in Egypt was how the villains were created. It&#039;s not just how villains are made to be typically bad in character, but how they could also be realistic as well. The flaws of these villains (such as Oingo &amp; Boingo and the D&#039;Arby brothers) are what makes them actually funny. Although this sounds inconsiderate, somehow these side villains&#039; misfortunes become increasingly amusing to watch, which was a reason why I loved this part of Stardust Crusaders the most! Dio&#039;s talkative nature contrasted with Jotaro&#039;s silent demeanour makes the action scenes more fun. So while they had serious characters (e.g., Jotaro, Kakyoin, Avdol) they did not forget to mix them up with those who provide some comedic relief in the show (e.g., Joseph, Polnareff, Dio). Now in terms of individual character development, this lacked emphasis in the story. Iggy (the dog) had at least a sliver of character development as he was given a chance in one whole episode to provide his own backstory. It was Iggy that was forced against his own will to travel with the four men to Egypt. Initially, he didn&#039;t contribute much to alleviate these mens&#039; hardships, at the end, you could finally see him coming to a realization into fighting Dio as well near the end of the show. It was unexpected to give a dog an episode, and I was relieved that they did. At least we know what this dog was thinking all along. It is too bad Part 3 did not emphasize much character development and backstory to some of the characters, such as Avdol and Kakyoin. It was only then when show came to a close was when you learn about these character&#039;s personal goals and background, a flaw that the show had to add in last minute. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
I absolutely thought Battle in Egypt was entertaining to the core. It wasn&#039;t just action, but a ton comedic scenes of outsmarting one person to another. This was one of the key aspects of the success of this series that inevitably gave birth to countless memes and JoJokes stemming from this show. <br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
The end of the mask origin story and Dio&#039;s revival would be memorable to a lot of fans. This is why it  is a must for new viewers who plan to watch the JoJo series to watch every part of it. If they didn&#039;t, they fail to recognize the growing changes and improvements of this show. Although I thought the fight between Dio and Jotaro was not the best in my opinion, it never fails to entertain in many different ways as much as possible.  <br />
