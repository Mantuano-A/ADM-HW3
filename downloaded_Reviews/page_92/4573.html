    Amazing...I just finished watching andI can&#039;t find another word to describe such a excellent poetic story...Don&#039;t watch this if u are hate Drama stuffs there is no happy feeling in this anime so don&#039;t judge it wrong for not making u feel right but It doesn&#039;t change how amazing is this anime if u can see the right picture in front of you.<br />
Story<br />
It&#039;s not about some dull guy cheating over girlfriend(yes it&#039;s look like that but it isn&#039;t).It&#039;s just nobody tries to look in the right direction.Story is about relations about many people and revaling the bonds.In the end it was an excellent drama and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22779">
        an excellent job to write such an complicate story and finishing of with an amazing end.End wasn&#039;t predictable and was awesome and I enjoyed every second(not like having fun with sad things but like even it&#039;s sad it was amazing).All character has an amazing story itself and whole story is amazing itself.A father who can&#039;t open himself to his son.A son who left alone too young.A girl waiting for the boy who himself doesn&#039;t remember the right moment....It&#039;s an amazing drama(one of the best I ever seen)just the ending part wasn&#039;t much clear so I think and I would be happy if there is a 3rd season and the rest is just amazing<br />

Does it need to be said how good it&#039;s.It is one of the best I saw and I loved these pastel drawnings sometimes It&#039;s excellent.<br />
Sound<br />
Sounds was good I think the lyrics especially was just right for the moment.<br />
Character<br />
Like I said up there characters are amazing.Everyone of them is specially designed and have a story to full a novel and every novel of this story is amazing.<br />
Enjoyment<br />
If we talk about how to enjoy a drama I think It&#039;s a masterpiece whoever can see the picture before them would reconize how wonderful is this series so yes if u wanna watch a drama u won&#039;t find better than this.

    Previous Season: 9 Out of 10<br />
<br />
&quot;You live and die by being an adaption of a Harem PC Game&quot;<br />
<br />
So no need to tell you any of the story as it continues from Season 1, All i will try to explain is how this season, Missed the mark in my mind.<br />
<br />
I got a sense of &quot;Filler&quot; for parts of some episodes, like they had to show even MORE of the work part, which seems to dominate this season, Plus being a Harem, they tried to even out the time you see all the characters and to be honest gave enough time to love the whole cast of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review78844">
        the show.<br />
<br />
Funny over the 2 seasons, my view on our main character Touya got worse, But this game me a BETTER opinion or view of all the other girls in his &quot;Harem&quot; love circle.<br />
<br />
This season did at times felt a little prolonged, I like series that go to a 26 Ep season, It gives you enough time to get across what YOU want, but this might of been better being trimmed and more to the point.<br />
<br />
Then the Ending, Wasn&#039;t how i wanted it to go and felt a little rushed in the last episode or 2.<br />
<br />
But does that make this season bad, No far from it, the whole unique feel from S1 Continues, its wonderfully put together but in a few points i think it could of been even better than it is.<br />
The Ending hurt it for me, I know WHY it happened, I will not spoil it in ANY way, But i wanted more or it rounded off better than it was.<br />
<br />
But don&#039;t let this stop you watching this season, Overall White Album is ONE of the best series i&#039;ve seen in many years, Suits watching around Winter as it is now :)<br />
<br />
Reasons For Changes From S1 Scores:<br />
<br />
Character - I set this higher as you FULLY knew every character by now. every little detail.<br />
<br />
Story - I set lower because at points it dragged and them someone it was even more frantic and packed with even more drama than the season 1, Main reason for lowering it was the ending.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - Same as S1, I love both and this series as a whole, but a few points as i&#039;ve highlighted let it down.

    Sometimes, men are at the mercy of goddesses. Just as the lost are at the mercy of their memories.<br />
<br />
The harem genre is a tricky topic to discuss. The concept of numerous women flocking over a single man labels it as men’s wish fulfillment. And when you get down to it, it’s true. Harem animes are fun to watch because of the selection of girls tailor-fit for every man and the possibilities with each one (if the show’s plot direction and runtime allows it). But with all the testosterone-induced enjoyment, most harem shows lack substance, use too many cliches that sell, and allow little room for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review170313">
        developed relationships with other characters. As fidelity and modern cultural practices dictate, the guy can only choose one. <br />
<br />
But what if the guy already made a choice, yet felt a need to continue his search...<br />
<br />
White Album is a cold and somber take on the reality of romance and career as well as how the past can delude the present. It’s definitely one of the harder shows to watch because of the sheer amount of infidelity, indecisiveness, and emotional restraint among the characters. It hit me on multiple occasions, but I bit the bullet and kept going. In the end, I was far from disappointed. It manages not only to resolve the plot and characters but also to justify actions and intents given the show’s genre and framework.<br />
<br />
This review covers the entirety of White Album. And other than its name, this show draws no references from The Beatles’ White Album. It’s a cool shout-out nonetheless.<br />
<br />
STORY - 10<br />
<br />
Touya Fujii, a humble man of unrefined tastes, has been dating rising star, Yuki Morikawa since high school ended. From then on, everything stands in the way between the two. No shipping. No wish fulfillment. No mercy. The main character unknowingly starts a harem, but this time the plot turns it on its head and he ends up going for all the prospects while still maintaining attachment to the first girl.<br />
<br />
With this in mind, there are three key things which the story has going for it. Setting, natural uncertainty, and an ending that makes sense.<br />
<br />
The setting says a lot in White Album. For one thing, the show takes place AFTER high school for a change. With the way Touya and Yuki finally got together after their high school years, White Album shows what happens after that. ‘I have the girl, now what?’ It’s a scenario often overlooked by most romance animes out there. What makes matters more difficult is the nature of Yuki’s profession as an idol singer. Idols have fans, connections, managers, and a production studio with a tight schedule to boot. The balance between career and relationship plays out. Knowing that we always want the best for our significant other, giving each other space and time to follow their passions is easier said than done. The distance may be a common problem relationships today face but White Album takes it up a notch with its time frame.<br />
<br />
Welcome back to 1986: a time when the Internet was unnecessary, radios were the only gateway to music, cellphones were rare, phone booths were abundant, and letters and answering machines were the closest thing to text messages. Not only is White Album’s time frame detailed, it also complements the show’s storyline to a tee. The resulting social dynamic is amazing; giving communication and face-to-face contact more value and meaning. Every successful phone call and meeting becomes a blessing, while every answering machine message is tinged with undertones of doubt, worry, and paranoia. Anyone can do anything behind people’s backs without letting them know; in the same way an unanswered phone call or letter can give anyone a reason to be more suspicious. Factor in everyone’s independent activities and schedules, and we have a setting that reinforces the unfaithful tendencies of the characters.<br />
<br />
In terms of plot progression, the show is really streamlined. Though the main focus is Touya, White Album’s narrative goes through the motions of everyone’s usual business. Some people are in the idol industry, some attend university, some go through various odd jobs, some are still in high school, and some have their own hobbies to pass the time. Character actions are as natural as wanting to go out with anyone during your own free time and convenience. Anything can happen and everyone is a catalyst. That’s what kept me glued to the show besides how the relationships work. The amount of uncertainty with the characters’ freedom and independence from the plot made White Album more refreshing and spontaneous. The pacing is relaxed to the point of slice-of-life’s standards, albeit more drab and lonely as life past 20 can get, with childhood recollections and the ending credits after every episode being the show’s brighter and more ephemeral moments.<br />
<br />
I don’t have to explain how a good ending affects a show. But in White Album’s case, it ties everything in a neat, little bow. By the end, I just had to applaud the story for resolving everything and everybody in the best and most coherent way possible while making sense of all the controversial acts done in the course of the show. I had no qualms. I had no questions. And I felt great after.<br />
<br />
ART - 8<br />
<br />
White Album’s animation is of above average quality with seldom fluid motion since stage performances and action sequences are few and far between. Characters stand out with clear outlines, splotches of light and shadow adding depth. Other than that, colors of the characters are generally flat to supplement the simple palette of the background. <br />
<br />
One glaring factor with the art for White Album is its creative use of varying degrees of watercolor in its background design to depict suburban melancholia fitting the adolescent look of the cast, giving a more mature tone to the series. Add in the noticeable shifts in animation style during the more powerful scenes and flashbacks and the show really looks like an album or gallery. During these transitions, the watercolor treatment is intensified; modifying character designs and at most, reducing the entire scene to a flurry of brush strokes with choppy animation. On one hand, it could be a cop-out for the animators, but on the other, it adds artistic flair to contrast the dreariness of the show&#039;s reality with the influx of the characters’ emotions.<br />
<br />
SOUND - 8<br />
<br />
The OP and ED for both seasons fit the show lyrically and thematically, but just don’t leave a lasting impression for me. And then I heard this show had idols which slightly raised my doubts about how I’ll perceive the sound for this show.<br />
<br />
I ended up downloading “White Album” and “Sound of Destiny” which are the signature songs of the main idol heroines, Yuki and Rina, respectively.<br />
<br />
It’s the seiyuus, BGM composers and the idols who are the stars of the sound department. Aya Hirano (Yuki) and Nana Mizuki (Rina) along with the other seiyuus did an astounding job in illustrating a disillusioned cast of individuals trying to get by during the late 80’s. <br />
<br />
The BGM composers took hint of character themes in White Album and made a solid effort in translating these to music. We have some double-bass driven slow jazz representing Frank Nagase and his swanky equipment, electric guitar wails coming from Eiji’s misunderstood rock background, classical piano and string pieces for Misaki and Akira’s classical literature and theater prowess, and dissonant piano editing for the mysterious Yayoi, to name some.<br />
<br />
As for the idol’s songs, I’m glad the composers and producers made it suitable for the given time frame. They still have the usual J-pop approach but with a more funky and R&amp;B-ish inflection with 80’s style synths and guitar-work as well as the trademark saxophone of the show’s self-titled song. Live renditions of the songs during performances with added instrumentation and acoustics are also thrown in to further enhance the sonic experience of the show. The tracklist overall (besides the OP and ED) is a catchy and passionate nod to the previous generation of pop music.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER - 10<br />
<br />
Let’s get archetypes out of the way first. We have the dense five-timer Touya, the all-too-sweet shrinking violet Yuki, Ms. Independent Rina, weird and sporty Haruka, tsundere loli Mana, motherly and capable Misaki, best bud Akira, cold and empty Yayoi, control freak big bro Eiji, uptight tiger mother Kanzaki, carefree bad girl Menou, and quiet shopkeeper Frank. <br />
<br />
With that said, plot happens and all these random individuals gain a new side to them, supported by later developments and intertwining backstories that logically influence who they are now. Nobody’s good. Nobody’s bad. Nobody’s perfect. And everyone’s misguided in one way or another. It’s these kinds of developments which flesh out the cast as people co-existing in an interesting web of relationships, instead of categorizing them to play a fixed role. <br />
<br />
Sometimes the best bud gets jealous, other times he’s cool. Sometimes Ms. Independent could be more dependent than you realize. Sometimes the shrinking violet can’t hold in her anxiety. And sometimes you can&#039;t help pity the cold and empty. <br />
<br />
As with the natural uncertainty of the plot, there’s a lot of gray area with the characters. You feel like rooting for everyone to cope with what the plot throws at them. And when they finally get through, you can confidently say they changed for the better. There are no open ends and everybody exits the stage in an orderly fashion. White Album has an abundance of relatable and well-rounded characters that change, develop, and find resolve when the curtains close. It doesn&#039;t feel like they’re in a story. It feels like we’re in their story.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT - 9<br />
<br />
Initially the star couple, Touya and Yuki, caught my attention and I thought it was going to be their love story. And in the course of White Album until it ended, I was reminded that it was never about their love story. It was about their relationship. It was about everybody’s relationships. Never have I seen the social aspect portrayed so well in an anime before. I enjoyed how everything played out and how personal it felt to watch them deal with it.<br />
<br />
Infidelity can be seen as a show of weakness; filling the void left by someone who means more to you than everyone you try to replace her with. You give in to anyone who shows compassion when all you wish for is the best for others and yourself. You keep yourself sane while she’s busy with her priorities, better off not knowing. Lying and hiding suddenly seem like the right thing to do.<br />
<br />
And then she starts to wonder why you don’t miss her as much as she does.<br />
<br />
What do you feel? Alienated by the very person you felt the most comfortable with. You forgot why you loved each other in the first place; to be reminded time and time again by your memories together. <br />
<br />
Before I get any more sentimental...<br />
<br />
OVERALL - 9<br />
<br />
Painful but rewarding, White Album is a harem gone wrong in the best way possible that describes the struggles any relationship goes through and the different ways we cope with those struggles, no matter how counter-intuitive they seem. <br />
<br />
It offers an unpredictable cast of characters, shaky relationships, an authentic blast from the past, a darker side of the idol industry, slightly unconventional animation techniques, an anthem of a heartfelt pop song, and a story that ends right.

    STORY<br />
   While the first season was a failure in my opinion, this season was a huge improvement. With the change of directors, White Album took a different direction with were it went. First of all, they resolved all of the unimportant subplots from the first season quickly (as quick as the show can be..). Then, they replaced it with a few more subplots, which was tied more to the main conflict. Even then, they didn&#039;t side track as much as the first season. This was a great choice on part of the production team. The story for this season, was more spread out.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review167021">
        It wasn&#039;t just about Touya, it gave some other characters screen time as well. As a result, I actually felt invested in the drama involving the other characters. Though, all of this is pulled down by really slow pacing. I seriously thought this season was a tad bit more slower than the first season. I was still asking myself &quot;when is this episode going to be over?&quot;, and I wished they could have improved the pacing. Also, the ending also lowered my opinion for the show. While it was satisfying on a certain level, I felt like the twist at the end was out of left field. Maybe it was foreshadowed, and I just couldn&#039;t see it. Even then, I think the twist was ridiculous. Plus, it felt anti climatic, it made all of the build up, wasted. So, with all of the let downs, the story of the second season of White Album was mediocre. <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
   This is where things are a big &quot;meh&quot;. Well, Touya is still an idiot, but I have to admit. He changes, and sees his flaws as a person, and for that I have to give credit for. Now, why do I still hate him as a character. It&#039;s because while he did go through some kind of development in the first season, that was all  thrown away. What he &quot;learned&quot; at the end of the first season was lost, and he ends up stumbling and making the same mistakes as before. Which is also why this season got weighted down. Now, as for the rest of the characters. Since they got some decent screen time, I actually cared about few of them. Yuki and Rina both were interesting, at many points. I liked Yuki in the second season, because they showcased her conflict (Somewhat). I felt like her conflict about what was more important in her life something that could be relatable. Though, she has a fair share of times I felt that she needed a slap. Rina, was an already interesting character from the first season, and she  keeps on being an interesting character. Though, she also has a few &quot;I want to slap you&quot; moments. Plus, Rina and Yuki had a believable friendship. I really felt for the drama and tension between the two.  As for the rest of Touya&#039;s whores, they weren&#039;t in the show as a romantic interests, but I still found a couple of them as &quot;throw away characters&quot;. Though, Mana&#039;s little subplot was interesting, and I was surprised to how she was connected to everything else. Overall, a huge improvement, but still lacking in many ways. <br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
   Also an improvement, was the animation. While it&#039;s only average, there were a few scenes that were animated well enough. The lighting also improved. While in the first season, things were always dark and grey. Seven Arcs actually drew the lights shining on the characters. Well, it&#039;s still nothing special. The lip sync during the small music segments, was better than I thought they would be. (Still crappy anime lip sync.) As, I said a few times in this section, it&#039;s an improvement, but it&#039;s average.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
   I don&#039;t think anything here was changed, I still felt like the ost was <br />
forgettable. The pop songs, while good, aren&#039;t seen much. Also, I have to complain about this. I don&#039;t think they ever played the song White Album in this season at all. If you aren&#039;t going to play the song at all, then why is your show named White Album. As a result the song comes off as an afterthought. I like the use of the song Powder Snow, because it was meaningful to the story, and I like the song. (Though I like the version sung by WA 2&#039;s Setsuna more.) Overall, not much change here. <br />
<br />
OVERALL<br />
   Overall, I feel like this season was pretty decent. It improved in most areas, but it&#039;s still brought down some of the same problems from the first season. I don&#039;t regret watching this season, but I&#039;m hard press to say you NEED to see this. You would have to sit through the first season to get to this, and I don&#039;t think that&#039;s worth the time. Though, I would recommend you watch the indirect sequel, White Album 2 over the original. (Not White Album second season. That&#039;s the show I&#039;ve been reviewing.). If you&#039;re up for something like this then go ahead. <br />

    In this season, it ties up all the loose ends and clears up everything about the whole show. It has taken the show to the next level and got even deeper.<br />
<br />
It continues where season 1 left off. (I hope that people who watched this didn&#039;t give up because it hides the back story.) I feel that this anime concluded well and the WTF events are evenly dispersed.<br />
<br />
To summarize, watch the first season and have the will to continue on. This is a great show and I recommend it.

    This is one of the most overrated anime I&#039;ve ever seen.  I picked it up because I&#039;d heard good things about it.  Like most anime, I tried to go in completely blind, so as to avoid any spoilers and get the full &quot;First Timer&quot; experience.  I had no idea that this was a show based off of a dating sim, or I probably would have picked up on that it was going to be utterly horrible from the beginning.<br />
<br />
But I didn&#039;t, and by the time I realized what kind of story this was going to be, I was a good seven episodes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294765">
        in.  So I figured, may as well finish the story, right?  That was such a torturous idea.  Twenty-six episodes of horrible characters with no redeemable qualities, all constantly falling over one another to get banged by Sir-Cheats-a-Lot.  By the end of the show I was genuinely impressed that he hadn&#039;t laid moves on every character in the entire show, with the exception of the completely untouchable incel friend.<br />
<br />
None of the plot made any real sense and the entire thing just seemed to be &quot;How can a bunch of people be as pretentious as possible, while still allowing MC to bang everything that moves?&quot;<br />
<br />
This was an entire waste of time, and every human being is better off skipping it.  The fact that people took so much time and effort to beautifully animate such a completely trash plotline and character base is beyond me.

    To be honest, I only watched this because of how good is WA2. The story itself was a good idea that may be able to make up a good romance story but the actions of the characters were so bad that at some point I just gave up trying to understand what they were trying to do. However, the OSTs and music were one of the best i heard, especially the songs that the idols perform. Overall, I feel like its not an anime I would recommend but it certainly leaves you thinking when you finish the series<br />
 <br />
Conclusion:<br />
Story-6<br />
Art-7<br />
Sound-9<br />
Character-2<br />
Enjoyment-4<br />
Overall-6<br />

    This is a review for both the first and second season. I admit that the second season did have a more redeeming feel and actual progression in the story. But the overall feeling I get from this anime is that it tried so hard to be everything and failed to be even something.<br />
<br />
I get this is based on a Eroge PC Harem Game. But I think that when an anime tries to hard to be exactly like it&#039;s adaptation it loses the feel of being an anime.<br />
<br />
This anime had so much potential. It had an artistic vibe, great soundtrack, somewhat interesting plot. But what it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review189155">
        lacked the most was direction. Sure people would have different preferences when it comes to who will be the chosen girl. But that&#039;s where it&#039;s aspect of trying to be like it&#039;s adaptation comes in. It didn&#039;t feel like an anime because it tried to go all over the place.<br />
<br />
5/10<br />
to summarize it up it had so much for it. It just lacked direction and it&#039;s identity as an anime and not as a game.

    This is another very difficult series to review. On one hand, you have a setting that is hardly ever used in anime - the mid &#039;80s, which means most of the convenience of today&#039;s life is missing. In one of the episodes this season, they even go out of their way to show how &quot;portable phones&quot; looked like back then! The art style really fits that period, and so do the clothing and cars and everything shown, and the way idols are depicted is nostalgic-they were just great singers with a bit more charisma. You also have something equally as rarely depicted, the challenges of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review383997">
        dating someone famous!<br />
On the other hand, you have a convoluted story at times, and what i consider to be, so far, the worst MC in any anime i watched. <br />
I previously mentioned charisma, and i feel like this guy is missing any of it. He somehow, while not being well spoken or showing wit in dialogues or actions, gets everyone to fall for him. He cheats his girlfriend with more women over the course of both seasons, and somehow. even when the girls find out, they still are ok with it.<br />
What makes the show worth going  through for me are the secondary characters (shoutout to Haruka, best girl ever) and the music and animation, but the story of a boring, good looking guy who cheats his way to the finish and gets away with it really drags the whole show down a lot.

    The key issue this show has is a problem of perspective. In my review of the first season, I stated that what let it down was its protagonist, referring to Touya as an instance of a Visual Novel protagonist where the player made all the stupidest choices. After this second season, this has cemented itself. In fact, Touya&#039;s ability to make decisions (and, honestly, just his sense of self-control) spirals even further down, and it makes it difficult to engage with the story at times; our protagonist becomes increasingly difficult to sympathise with, and as such any happy ending feels unearned. <br />
<br />
The thing that makes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review381877">
        this more difficult is also the thing that keeps the show afloat despite him; basically any other character would have been a better protagonist. Because, to be honest, I really like almost everyone else in the cast. The majority of the primary cast of love interests are all interesting, with distinct motivations and desires, who make interesting choices, and while they&#039;re not always the best choices, they feel solid and relatable. As such, when we see where they end up at the end of their stories, it&#039;s a lot more satisfying than Touya, and I can&#039;t help but wonder how much better the show would be if one of them were the focus; <br />
<br />
A story not about some aimless loser (and serial cheater) with no real drive, but...<br />
<br />
A show about the friendship between two Idols; the upstart rookie and the successful star<br />
<br />
A story about a musician with a secret, who&#039;s trying to work out what she wants in her life, and starting to question whether she&#039;s following that dream at all.<br />
<br />
A high-school student with a complicated home life, trying to work out how to relate to her family.<br />
<br />
And these stories are there, and they&#039;re what makes this show work better than it deserves to be. But every time something compelling happens in their story, Touya is there to remind us that this story is more about some guy&#039;s weird relationship hang-ups. It&#039;s a shame, because I really do think this could have been a really good story. And I&#039;m also not saying I didn&#039;t enjoy it; like I say, the things that are good are there, and are compelling. <br />
<br />
Plenty of shows have shoddy protagonists but make up for it with strong supporting casts. But, here, while it does a little to make up for Touya&#039;s pitfalls, it still isn&#039;t quite enough to make it great.

    Well this was really hard to watch my advice is DON&#039;T DARE TO WATCH IT YOU WILL REGRET IT.<br />
<br />
Tries to get more drama but the character is such human trash yet in the end there are no repercusions to his actions like someone trying to kill him,people ganging up to beat him or commiting suicide,is like he is forgiven of everything for crying and saying i loved everyone yet is a character that never loved anyone or showed anyone just wanted to have sex with any girl.<br />
The characters are all horrible the only exceptions would be Nanase (touya friend),Yuki and Rina and those would be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370351">
        since the others well...<br />
.- Misaki was prostituing when younger once in university she &quot;changed&quot; dated tamaru got pregnant met tomaru dad and realized tamaru dad was one of his clients so she extorted money besides getting money for an abortion.<br />
.- Haruka while she seems fine there are some serious problems specially when you realize her older brother died because of her (accident while both played tennis)<br />
.- Ogata well while he seems fine he raped Yuki in the game so you have that also explained better the latest episode stuff.<br />
.- Touya is human trash always victimizing himself with things like &quot;my mom died&quot; or &quot;i have problems with my dad&quot; but most of the so called problems with his dad derail on Touya being a shitty human being that never loved anyone and just pretend to love Yuki,yet he doesn&#039;t try to change and expect to be forgiven for crying a bit which he does a lot on the whole series.<br />
<br />
The story well originates in an eroge so you can&#039;t expect that much specially with a failure in sales game (kinda weird School Days and White album are really similar the only thing good about School Days is the protagonist get punished for his actions while White Album has the protagonist cry a little and is forgiven for being human trash and not even showing affection the other thing they are similar is both games failed in japan), the music is passable at least and the art seems fine but only that.

    Season 2 review.<br />
<br />
Story 7:<br />
   It&#039;s a continuation of white album. Which is an anime about a man who&#039;s girlfriend is part of the idol business. He is confused and is trying to fill a void in his life. While making dumb decisions while involving people he loves or respects. As the story goes on.<br />
   We get to see more of Touya fall right back into his dumb decisions except seem more unjustified then season 1. As well as Yuki trying to push through and try to rise in the idol business. For a friends promise. As well as a new surprise

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300865">
        following the Ogita business. Over all the narrative is still the same as the last season except easier to follow with more surprises, and more characters being fleshed out. <br />
   I don&#039;t want to spoil to much about it.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation 7: <br />
   The animation seems a little better then season 1.<br />
   <br />
Sountrack/Music 8:<br />
   The opening and ending themes are great. Especially Yuki and Rina&#039;s vocals.<br />
   <br />
Characters 8:<br />
   This is the season&#039;s strength. This season covers and fleshes out more of the pre-established characters of season 1. I can&#039;t say much because I don&#039;t want to spoil the characters. There are some flaws like Yuki and Touya but if you want to know check the spoilers at the bottom.<br />
   <br />
Cons compared to season 1:<br />
   Through most of this season Touya becomes more unlikable and less justified compared to season 1. In season 1 he is both liked and hated because you could understand and justify his reasoning. Even if you don&#039;t agree or like his reasoning. But in season 2 you know what he is doing but now you lose more reason to agree with him. In this season he just seems more like a leech then confused man in most cases.<br />
   Then the last episode comes in and sort fixes that problem (some what). But the explanation reinforces him more as a pitiful character which does suit him if you watched through both seasons and listened to his father (check the spoilers at the bottom if you want to know what I am talking about).<br />
<br />
Pro&#039;s compared to season 1:<br />
   The context of this season is easier to follow then season 1 even though there are still parts where you will have to remember and wait to be answered later on in the season. Such as Touya&#039;s fathers memory/flashback.<br />
Also more characters get fleshed out and developed.<br />
<br />
Over all: <br />
   I really enjoyed the anime but as far as the main character goes he is more unjustified in this season(sort of). Don&#039;t drop this anime just because the main character gives you a headache. The characters and what follows on in the rest of this season is more then enough to keep watching. Watching what the Ogita siblings have to deal with in this season, as well as seeing more Mana and her family, and Touya&#039;s father(one of the best characters) is worth it. There&#039;s more but those are a few examples. <br />
  While the ending itself clears up Touya&#039;s reasoning for what he does. I feel like the end of result of the reasoning wasn&#039;t fair to Yuki and what she had to endure because of his screw ups. Also I wish there was more consequence for Touya. Over all I rate this season a 7 and I rate the anime a 7.5 out of 10. For anyone confused about the reason why Touya acted the way he did proceed to the bottom for spoilers(If you watched and finished the anime but didn&#039;t get his reasoning).<br />

<br />
   The last episode is the reason why Touya made all those stupid decisions was because he regret throwing away a special present from a special girl. Before we discuss the reason for his dumb decisions lets learn more about Touya. We get more context on Touya and his character. As well as the view point from his father. Which are key to understanding Touya and his relationship with his dad and as well the way he acts. <br />
   Through seasons 1 and 2 we see Touya&#039;s father act more aggressive and negative towards his son but that&#039;s because he sees Touya as a kid even now as an adult. As a kid Touya acted more of a cry baby, seem to have low self esteem, and seemed like cowardly child. This is what I gathered when I watched the series as well as what his father thinks of him and feels about him. There is a flash back of Touya, Yuki, and Haruka as little kids and long story short they deal with bullies. After this you see Touya crying. That&#039;s where Yuki comes in after Touya&#039;s father asked her to support and help his son.<br />
   Touya&#039;s father knew that his son had a fragile heart. So he wanted Yuki to support, watch over, and help his son because he was worried about him(it&#039;s referenced through some of his fathers memories and flashbacks of him talking to Yuki about his son.) Yuki goes and gives a medal to Touya that says good job. Touya throws away the medal. Then his dad told him it was a gift for him and that he didn&#039;t understand her feelings. <br />
   After this Touya went to look for it with a sad look on his face. To him it was a special present that came from a young girls heart and he just threw it away like trash. He spent hours and hours looking for it but never found it. Not long after Yuki movied far away. So he was never able to thank her for what she did and he never saw her again or so he thought.<br />
   Ever since then he&#039;s been regretting it and it shaped him as the person he is now. Who thought more about girl&#039;s feelings but also still had a fragile heart and thought more using his feelings instead of his. As he grew he ends up finding Yuki again in high school. But he didn&#039;t remember her nor thought she was the same little girl that gave her the medal all those years ago. As he was heading towards college his mother died.<br />
   The passing of his mother upset Touya&#039;s father very much but not as much as Touya himself. He saw how it was going to hold back Touya and how it was dragging him down even more. So his father kicked him out of the house and got him his own place. This was done in order to try to make Touya tougher to push him and make him focus more on college. As well as trying to get him to be more independent instead of moping and focusing on his mothers death.<br />
   Through the rest of the series you get hints of his father helping his son, showing disappointment, and showing concern for him right until his death. Now that we understand Touya let&#039;s talk about Touya&#039;s reasoning for his dumb decisions. &quot;It all started with him as a kid throwing away a medal that was given to him as a present and to make him feel better. It was a special present that came from a young girls feelings and he just threw it away like trash&quot;. After that he spent hours looking for it but never found it.<br />
   Then Yuki moved away and he thought he was never going to see nor thank her and apologize. &quot;He regretted it and decided to think more about girls/women feelings&quot;. This is the reason why he made those stupid decisions. He wanted to fill the void with that regret he made as a kid while also thinking about those people&#039;s feelings. The problem is he fell in love and started forgetting about Yuki.<br />
   While I understand how something from your childhood can effect you long term. I feel that Yuki went through too much pain just because of his dumb decisions. In the end there was no consequence for him cheating. Thankfully he realizes that he screwed up. That being there for her when he wanted or had time wasn&#039;t enough.<br />
   He understands how he ignored her feelings. But still I just wish there was consequences for his actions. Also Rina realizes she lost to Yuki and left. Anyways that&#039;s all I can say. Send me a pm if you have any questions.<br />
   It&#039;s still a good anime.

    [THIS REVIEW WILL FOCUS PURELY ON THE SECOND SEASON. GENERAL CRITIQUES OF THE OVERALL PLOT CAN BE FOUND IN MY REVIEW FOR THE FIRST SEASON]<br />
<br />
I&#039;m glad that White Album 2nd Season came out because I believed that the first season could have delivered more than it did. The most important thing about White Album: 2nd Season is that it brought much-needed context (the whole Menou Matsuyama, Yuki Morikawa and Touya Fujii connection) that brought clarification to several plot holes. It even managed to tie in Fujii&#039;s father, making the latter a more important character than was originally established. Although Eiji Ogata&#039;s painting fiasco brought about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249577">
        some questions, I did feel as if it was a nice reflective point that brought a different level in the anime. All of these things, aside from several unravellings (with regard to relationships) that occurred, were significant in the sense that they capitalized on the mature themes of this particular anime. While I didn&#039;t come out of this anime fully convinced, it did manage to exceed my expectations (hence the higher rating for this season).<br />
<br />
Props to several songs, Koi iro Sora, Powder Snow, and Shishido Rumi&#039;s Secret Chaos.

    I love the series of the white album  watch it all but i find it confusing on the last episode of the 2nd season of the white album because they didnt show the main character going in in yuki&#039;s apartment. He was talking  to haruki while the fuji stares at the apartment that yuki used to live that time skipped to that day fuji san helping mana chan parents gahtring some stuff because they are moving to a new house. And when i check the manga version of it has a different ending after the festival . fuji san move to a new
