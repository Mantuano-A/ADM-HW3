    I remember seeing the first few episodes of pokemon Black and White on TV when they were first coming out over here and I was rather upset about them. My biggest gripe was with Ash’s character design, which was made to look younger. So I can totally understand the mindset behind the people who are upset about the change in art style the show has made, which is much bigger in contrast than it was in Black and White. Yet I’m not on their side this time. In fact I really love the new art style and how colourful and round it is. In fact

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321295">
        I love almost everything about the new Sun and Moon anime, so much so that it might be the most I’ve ever enjoyed pokemon. Even as a kid I wasn’t as entranced by pokemon as I am now; back then it was just day to day business. Yet despite how much I think it’s great, Pokemon Sun and Moon is very controversial amongst fans and there’s a lot of people who are very mad at it. Clearly these people, most of whom are certainly long term pokemon fans, have ideas about what a pokemon series should contain, that Sun and Moon isn’t living up to. So in this review I don’t just want to talk about all the things that I love about the anime, but I will occasionally also lightly touch up on some criticisms of the show and why I don’t share them. I’m hoping I can not only show people whether they fall into the group that would actually enjoy Sun and Moon or not, but also help some people to appreciate it, who didn’t already.	<br />
<br />
Naturally there is one aspect of the Sun and Moon anime that is immediately obviously different from the earlier installments of the show: the art style. Gone are the spiky haired shounen character designs of the original series, as they’re replaced by these new round and colourful ones. The water colour (or at least water-colour-looking) backgrounds of the original series are replaced by digital ones, that are even greener. Though that is an earlier innovation from long before Sun and Moon. The animation, too, has changed considerably. The animation is much more fluid now, with the animators having incorporated a lot more smear frames to make it more expressive. Everything about the look of Sun and Moon is much more poppy and expressive, which adds to the much more lighthearted tone of the show.	<br />
<br />
But why did Ash’s character design change so much? X and Y seemed to be going excellently, with lots of fans loving it and lots of people in the industry praising it. Why suddenly make such a big shift in such a big aspect of a show that’s going really well? Was it an evil scheme by the producers of the show to make pokemon look more like youkai watch so they can make more money? Well, no, not exactly. The thing you have to realize is that Ash’s character design has always been changing and it has always been changing too slowly. Even during the original series you saw his design slowly change and the makers of the show have always been very careful to implement new digital technology as gradually as possible, so that people wouldn’t notice. The difference here is that there is suddenly a big change, instead of a gradual one. An often noted fact about X and Y was that though the battle scenes were able to look really great due to all the innovations the team was already starting to make back then, Ash himself was rarely animated and the team even had a couple of stock animations of Ash throwing a pokeball, because no one wanted to animate him. The thing that pushed the team over the edge to change the character designs so drastically now, was that OLM was experimenting with more modern digital animation techniques and simpler, more rounded character designs are useful for that. The reason why pokemon now looks more like youkai watch, is because the character designs in youkai watch were also made to fit the same criteria. Though the fact that people unironically and without question put forth the idea that the character designs were made to match those of youkai watch, as if pokemon is some cheap cash grab that’s trying to leach off the popularity of that series, is some of the funniest stuff I’ve ever heard.	<br />
<br />
Despite that, I’m not actually a huge fan of Ash’s redesign. His original design came from a time of spiky haired shounen protagonists, animated with coloured cells. His design was made for a different era of animation and so when adapting his design for modern animation techniques, it’s impossible not to lose something along the way, especially if the priority was to make him easy to animate, rather than nice to look at. If you try to play a game of spot the main character in Sun and Moon, you wouldn’t be spotting Ash, as he just doesn’t look as well designed as the other major characters in the show. Then again, that might have more to do with the fantastic character designs the other characters in Sun and Moon have.	 <br />
<br />
So what’s up with the rest of the Sun and Moon character designs? The original series started in the 90s, when it was very common for TV anime to make up for a lack of animation quantity, with beautiful and detailed character designs. And pokemon has always had great character designs, even if they didn’t always animate as well. Sun and Moon takes the opposite approach, using very simple character designs to have them animate better. What you have to consider, though, is that when you make a simple character design, you draw significantly fewer lines, and as such, every line becomes more important and has to be more carefully considered. As such, creating a simple character design, that’s also really good and very memorable, is a lot harder that it may seem at first. It’s incredible to see just how many unique and extremely memorable designs Sun and Moon manages to have and how many designs from the games were flawlessly adapted for 2d animation. And the games themselves had a different design focus as well, moving away from their more anime inspired character designs, giving them a much wider appeal. As a result, Pokemon Sun and Moon has a completely unique look within the wider anime landscape. What Sun and Moon has actually retained from older pokemon, however, is that the character designs of the girls tend to look better than that of the boys. Suiren is a very cute and unique looking tomboy and Moa looks very sweet, but Kaki and Maamane look pretty boring in comparison, though certainly not bad. On top of that, there’s the ever adorable Lillie, who seems to be the unanimous winner among all the Sun and Moon characters and has a genuine cult following behind her. Sure, not every design in Sun and Moon gets to be that unique, but there are a lot of great ones, even outside of the main characters, and I personally think this season of pokemon might have the largest quantity of great looking character designs yet.	<br />
<br />
So what about this animation that I keep mentioning? A lot of people didn’t just lament the character designs and the “graphics” of the new pokemon anime, when Sun and Moon was just announced, they also called out the animation of the show for being bad. Now, many of these people were the type of people who would pause on a smear frame and call it bad animation, completely negligent of the fact that animation only happens when you have multiple frames, or of the fact that the usage of smear frames is an industry standard, so don’t take them too seriously. But what would someone who actually knows anything about animation think about Sun and Moon? Well, mostly that it is extremely impressively well animated. You have to note, pokemon is a long running anime, so every episode has to be made, on average, in about a week. So the fact that it has been consistently one of the most impressively well, if not the most impressively well, animated anime of every season it has been a part of, is ludicrous. In fact, Sun and Moon might be the most animated long running TV anime of all time. And that is no exaggeration.	<br />
<br />
I think the big disconnect people have with Sun and Moon is in the animation style. The focus of previous seasons has always been on the pokemon. If you look at the pokemon from Sun and Moon and from the original show you can barely see the difference, where if you look at the character designs between those shows, or even between the original show and X and Y, you see a much bigger change. The pocketmonster designs have always remained relevant and animating them has always been easy. Or at least for the small ones. The reason why Ash’s pokemon rarely evolve might partially be caused by the fact that smaller pokemon are easier to animate. Though the more important reason is because those unevolved pokemon might simply have better designs than their evolved counterparts, and one of the main purposes of the pokemon anime has always been to sell merchandise. The fact that the people in pokemon were rarely animated in any interesting way was never a problem, because it was always about the pokemon, even (or maybe especially) in battle focused X and Y. But Sun and Moon puts a much larger focus on the characters and wants to express a lot more emotions and a lot fewer battles. As such, goofy faces and all kinds of expressions and animations that leave or bend the limitations of the original character models are everywhere. In a show like X and Y, the characters will rarely move much and will rarely go off model; and a lot of people are into that. I think a lot of people just want their anime characters to be on model all the time and be more serious, most of the time, like the characters in a show like Legend of the Galactic heroes. Sure, that’s a bit of an exaggeration, but you get what I mean. But as much as I like that show, and as much as I think that style works for it, I would usually much rather see creative, goofy animation, than stiff animation that’s unwilling to bend it’s character models(even if the show has fantastic visual directing that makes it work). I just love anything that’s goofy and creative. Goofy faces and smeary animation are my bread and butter. I can’t get enough of them.	<br />
<br />
Naturally, if you have a lighthearted show like Sun and Moon, you need fun characters to populate that show. The main six at the pokemon school all have their goofs, at different levels. Ash himself is laid back at times, but easily excitable. Unlike Ash in the original show, he’s not very bratty and he seems to take life as it comes to him, not the other way around. He’s not as concerned about becoming a pokemon master, and really just wants to have fun and do a few island trials. I’ve seen a lot of people call him childish in comparison to his X and Y counterpart, but I think they might have the terms ‘serious’ and ‘mature’ confused. These two are not the same thing. I remember being a six year old, being annoyed at adults for acting in a goofy manner. Who do you think knew more about maturity? Six year old me, or actual adults, who thought it was perfectly fine to be an adult that still loves being silly? For the most part during the show Ash is understanding of people and pokemon and tries his best to make friends. This is a far cry from the stubborn Ash in season 1 who still has a lot of growth to do. If you compare Sun and Moon Ash to original Ash, he’s definitely grown a lot over the years and I personally even look up to his attitude. He’s really found his way and is enjoying the little things in life. He probably read all of “Á la recherche du temps perdu” on the boat over to Alola. And the way that he combines that attitude with him still being loud and funny and excitable is just really fun to watch.	<br />
<br />
Then there’s all these side characters. Lillie is the most popular and the most developed. She is initially scared of pokemon and has a bad relationship with her mother, but works through that. She’s very reserved but it becomes increasingly clear as the show goes on that she does actually want to be a part of the main group and be goofy right along with them. And seeing her pulling goofy faces or trying to be brave is just so cute. She’s adorable. I can definitely see why she has such a strong cult following. My personal favourite side character might be Suiren, though. She’s a tomboy who loves fishing, but she’s much more than that. She’s one of the funniest characters in the show. Sometimes she just does really funny things out of nowhere, just to mess with people, and she’s always up for whatever cool things the guys are doing. She’s the most surprising character out of all and you just never know when she will do something completely insane out of nowhere. Though her tomboyish nature doesn’t mean she can’t be girly. She and Mao are best friends and she can be just as girly as Mao when she wants. It’s nice to see a tomboy in media who hasn’t completely rejected femininity altogether. I think that’s more  a stereotype than anything. The only downside to Suiren is that she isn’t always doing funny stuff or saying funny things. I think a more consolidated cast, where Suiren had more focus put on her, could have made her an incredibly fun character to watch. As she is right now she’s kind of inconsistent. Her friend Mao is a little more boring. She’s cute and fun, but not extremely memorable. She runs a restaurant with her dad and is overall a good, hardworking girl.	<br />
<br />
On the guy’s side there’s Kaki who is one of Ash’s rivals this season, though not his main one. Most of the time he’s acting more serious, but when the situation calls for it he can be the goofiest one of them all. There are lots of funny jokes and cool animation moments involving him and he becomes adorable when anything involves his little sister. Just like Suiren, he’s somewhat of a mixed bag, but I love him anyways. These characters make up the heart of what makes Sun and Moon so enjoyable. I’ve heard people complain that the characters in Sun and Moon don’t get enough development, but I have to disagree on that one. I don’t think developing a character significantly is necessary to create a fun and engaging piece of media. The fact that these characters are still making me laugh over 140 episodes in is a testament to how well they work. Though, sure, any character can always be better. I’m saying that these characters are vastly more than sufficient to make me thoroughly enjoy the show. Oh, also there’s Maamane. He’s fat. Also he likes tech. I think we can all agree that Maamane kinda sucks. Luckily there are enough other side characters that are fun to watch to make up for him.	<br />
<br />
Now it’s great and all that the show has so many fun characters, but what is the episode to episode experience of watching it like? What is it like structurally? What is the story about? Of course you likely have already noticed that this part isn’t as important to me, considering how much I’ve been gushing about all the other aspects of the show, but naturally the structure is important to any show. And it’s extremely interesting to look at what parts of the original show Sun and Moon decided to keep or emphasize and what parts to lessen. I’ve said that Sun and Moon has less battling and that’s true, but when it comes to important battles, like gym battles or league battles, it’s not actually that far behind it’s predecessors. What it does away with is actually mostly team rocket battles and battles between Ash and random people he encounters. There’s far less of that in Sun and Moon and I think that’s good. Even in the original show team Rocket’s spiel got tiresome pretty quickly, so seeing their episodes be replaced with creative episodic episodes and them being relegated to comedic relief is fantastic. And the fights that are still there, mostly island trial battles, rival battles or league battles, are generally pretty good. Though even in the original pokemon series it took until the Johto league, 270 episodes in, before I saw any battles that truly excited me, and Sun and Moon was a similar situation.	<br />
<br />
Sun and Moon got a lot of flak for focusing more on slice of life, rather than adventure, but I think that, in actuality, it doesn’t really matter. I mean, the gang can still go adventuring out in the woods or on other islands and is that really much different from the gang in the original getting lost in similar looking woods all the time? Structurally, all it really changes is that the main characters don’t sleep in the same location as each other and that they don’t have to go out looking for a pokemon center, every time they find a pokemon that’s hurt, which constantly happened in the original show. Really, it’s not even that much of a structural difference to the show. If the writers want the gang to go into some cave they go into some cave. It may be a slice of life show, but that doesn’t mean it’s not an adventure show. The only real fear is of the aesthetic, the idea of them being on an adventure, being lost. But I don’t think that’s even a problem, considering Ash is already far away from home here and the geography on the island seems to be much more varied than all those similar looking woods and plains from the original show. X and Y emphasized the battling aspect of the original show and tried to make it more exciting, but Sun and Moon emphasizes the episodic adventures and makes them funnier and more creative. It does focus a lot more on people than the original, though, which focused largely on pokemon and their relationship to human society, but other that that, it’s not even like Sun and Moon does a lot the original didn’t already. Sun and Moon and X and Y just emphasize different aspects of what made the original great. In that sense I think they are both great successors to the original pokemon series and should both have the right to exist.	<br />
<br />
Pokemon Sun and Moon puts a lot of emphasis on episodic episodes, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t any story to it at all. The overall  narrative is about Ash going to a new region and trying to beat all of this island’s versions of gym leaders with the new pokemon he’s caught over there. This is typical of pokemon series past the original, but there’s one key difference, which greatly affects the tone of the series. Ash rarely, mentions the idea of becoming a pokemon master, unlike his first season counterpart, who can’t shut up about becoming one. From the very beginning his journey to Alola is never about beating some pokemon league. It’s purely about experiencing local culture, meeting new people, catching new pokemon, and maybe challenging some tough trainers he meets along the way. Ash in Sun and Moon seems to have realized that the adventures he has and the people he meets along the way are much more important than the end goal of his journey itself. He’s excited about every new thing he gets to experience, and welcomes every distraction along the way. And the show itself is similar. The show wants to do as many different things as possible and will actively avoid the trap of centering an episode on team rocket stealing Pikachu or relegating a large chunk of almost every episode to that. But besides all kinds of creative episodes the show also has some story arcs that can get very exciting and emotional. The show does like to pack an emotional punch from time to time, which I appreciate, and it’s not scared to talk about death. Sun and Moon is a varied experience, and because of that, doesn’t get tiresome or monotonous very quickly.	<br />
<br />
Now, though these arcs and individual episodes can get very serious, for the most part Sun and Moon is still very lighthearted and casual. From the very beginning, Ash just wants to have fun and beat some island challenges. Participating in the pokemon league was never a part of the plan, because at the start of the show the pokemon league didn’t exist yet in Alola. In the original show Ash explicitly wants to go to Johto to participate in the league there. Ash’s focus has clearly changed and so has the show’s. To previous seasons the pokemon league was the goal and beating it the ultimate test. But in Alola, the league is a casual experience among friends and neighbors, likely a remnant of the earlier island trial tradition. So when the League in Sun and Moon came around and didn’t take itself as seriously as it had in previous seasons a lot of fans were upset. But I think this is a case of wrong expectations. The battles in the Alola league were good, even if they weren’t that big. There were a few comedy fights or fights with funny moments in them, and I can understand that someone who takes the league very seriously might be bothered by that, but those fights were all fun to watch either way. A show doesn’t need massive stakes for it to be enjoyable. It can just be about the personal stakes of a couple characters you care about. Ash facing off against his rivals this season wasn’t really any less exciting than it was in previous seasons, because rival battles have always been about personal stakes. The fact that the Alola league didn’t feel as grandiose and official points to the fact that this season of pokemon has a different appeal, and that’s really too bad for people who simply want out of pokemon what they got from X and Y. But the appeal that Sun and Moon is going for it’s doing fantastically.	<br />
<br />
And with that we finally reach the end. Ash has said that he wants to see the rest of the world, and the next pokemon series is going to be about him travelling the world. Team rocket finally answers the question “What even is this feeling?” with “what a great feeling”, yet they only realized this right as they had to leave. I’d love to see where these characters go next, however it seems that Sword and Shield might become a reboot instead of a sequel. Either way, it seems that Sword and shield is once again going for a slightly different appeal from the last two series, and I think it will be a little less controversial because the appeal might lie more in the middle and Ash’s design is more pleasing to look at. To someone who doesn’t like Sun and Moon it might seem that their nightmare is finally over. To me it’s just yet another opportunity for a unique, new pokemon anime. Though I am sad to have to say goodbye to my favourite season of pokemon and I’m unsure if the next season will truly live up to it, but considering I haven’t heard anything about significant staff changes, I’m not that scared.<br />
<br />
You didn’t need to read all the way through this review to understand whether Sun and Moon was going to be your thing or not. You’d have seen whether you were on one line with me a few paragraphs in. If all that goofy fun stuff and those goofy faces and all that creative animation sounds great to you, you’re probably someone who is much more open about the fact that you like media that can just be fun and doesn’t need to be anything more. Otherwise if you still lament the fact that Sun and Moon doesn’t have as many battles, or if you want it to be more ‘serious’ and ‘adult’ you’ll probably dislike it. There’s a middle ground of people who think it’s just okay, but either way you can probably tell. But I’m not actually expecting many people to be reading this review to try and understand whether they’d like it or not. Most people have probably already seen it and made up their minds a long time ago. If you loved the show you probably wanted someone to talk about what you loved about it, in an endless sea of haters. And if you dislike it, you’re probably reading this review to discredit me. You probably, by now, think I’m a dipshit and this review is probably just making you angry. I just hope I got you to understand my perspective just a little bit.	<br />
<br />
If 4200 words of a glowing review didn’t already tell you, I love pokemon Sun and Moon. I just have so much fun watching it. And that one word, “fun” speaks to the core of the show for me. The animators and writers of the show turned pokemon into what it is because that would be fun. Industry professionals from all over the industry praise the hell out of the Sun and Moon anime, and considering the amount of anime references that are in it, you can clearly tell that the creators of Sun and Moon still have lots of passion for the medium of anime and still have lots of fun creating pokemon. And I still have lots of fun watching it. The older I get the more I realize that the main thing I’m looking to get out of anime is fun. I love media that gives me joy, because there is no feeling I’d rather feel than joy. Sun and Moon’s fun characters, their funny expressions, the expressive animation, the references to all kinds of anime I love and the occasional emotional punch the show still has the weight to throw around, I love it all so much. There are few things in life that give me so much joy as knowing that pokemon is still fun to watch, 15 years after I first started watching it. Sure it isn’t perfect. Every episodic show, even something as prolific as Bebop or space dandy, is going to have weaker episodes. In particular I’d say episode 26 is kinda trash, though I’ll forgive it for how great episode 28 is. Still, Sun and Moon might be the best kids anime I’ve ever seen, and that says a lot considering how much I love Ojamajo Doremi.	<br />
<br />
On that topic, If you loved Sun and Moon and you want to watch stuff like it, I’d highly recommend Ojamajo Doremi, which also has simpler more expressive character designs, with every facial reaction under the sun. You’ll probably also love Heartcatch precure and Sailor moon and you might even be into 100% Pascal sensei(and be a part of an exclusive club of like 3 people who like that show), and you’ll definitely be into Mahoujin Guruguru(2017). If you prefer X and Y, you’ll be delighted to know there’s an entire genre of anime that has the same appeal of that show. It’s called the “Shounen action” genre. You might have heard of it; it’s fairly popular. Of course that includes stuff like Hunter x Hunter(2011) and Fullmetal alchemist, that most people have already seen, but it’s a vast genre that you’re not going to watch all of anytime soon. If you somehow don’t know how to find that stuff, you can always PM me for recommendations. Anyways, I hope that regardless of whether you like Sun and Moon or not, we can all come to one agreement: Let’s hope Sword and Shield is going to be the best pokemon anime yet.<br />

    If what you value in anime is a tightly written plot, fleshed out and well-developed characters, or strong, resonant themes, than I am sorry to say that the Sun and Moon anime will likely disappoint you.<br />
<br />
The plot is generally episodic, with the &quot;main&quot; story only advancing sporadically, often seemingly at random, and sometimes, you may question what the plot&#039;s even supposed to be.<br />
<br />
The characters are used inconsistently, with some receiving far more attention than others. Some will develop a lot, others not at all, despite them all having just as much potential. <br />
<br />
And on the whole, after you&#039;ve caught up to the show, you may

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274264">
        look back and question if you&#039;ve really learned anything. Indeed, you may be asking: &quot;What was the point?&quot;<br />
<br />
Many shows would crumble under the weight of these flaws, and I couldn&#039;t entirely blame you if this has put you off from watching this anime.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER...<br />
<br />
Pokemon Sun and Moon is one of the warmest, most wholesome, and downright most pleasant shows I have ever seen. All of the above criticisms are perfectly valid, but instead of buckling over these shortcomings, Sun and Moon laughs off the complaints, reaches out its hand, and invites you to have some fun.<br />
<br />
The aesthetic is top tier. Alola is a tropical island, and this is nailed down so perfectly that any individual shot of most episodes immediately gives off a warm and pleasant vibe. Just looking at the show puts me at peace, but it&#039;s not just the artwork that&#039;s impressive. Many were wary of the character design changes Sun and Moon implemented, but the simplified designs not only mesh incredibly well with the setting, but also serve to make animating these characters much easier. I feel confident saying that this is the most well-animated Pokemon series to date, and one of the best looking long-running anime of all time. Whether it&#039;s an intense Pokemon battle or even a baseball face-off, everything is brought to life so vibrantly that it&#039;s impossible not to be charmed.<br />
<br />
The overarching plot may be lacking, but every episode provides it&#039;s own little story that manages to entertain, in so many different ways. One episode you&#039;ll be laughing at the antics of lost Pokemon finding their way home, another episode you&#039;ll be awed by a sudden explosion of stellar fight animation, and sometimes you&#039;ll find yourself tearing up at some of the saddest scenes in Pokemon history.<br />
<br />
But never fear, because you can wipe those tears away with some fun on the beach, see what new shenanigans Team Rocket is getting up to (spoiler alert: their new friend is EXTREMELY protective), and maybe even get hyped for a new capture or evolution. <br />
<br />
You&#039;ll have plenty of friends to experience this all with. Some might say TOO many, in fact, as the show often struggles to give every main character something important to do, but that&#039;s all right, you&#039;ll always get to see them again in the next episode. Every character is a joy to watch, boasting great designs and voice acting to really bring them to life. They all get time to shine, in different ways, and even the few I didn&#039;t like at the beginning grew on me quickly. The good vibes this group gives off are infectious, and this is a group of friends I&#039;m happy to watch doing pretty much anything.<br />
<br />
Of course, some may still be disappointed. Especially coming off the heels of XYZ, which took the Pokemon anime to a more serious place than it&#039;s ever been. Many might wonder why they should bother with a show that looks so silly in comparison. They may wonder what it could offer them, when all the goofy faces and simple designs seem so much like they&#039;re trying to appeal to children. And make no mistake, the show IS primarily for children. The Pokemon anime always has been. But just because that&#039;s the target audience, doesn&#039;t mean everyone can&#039;t have fun with it. <br />
<br />
The point of Sun and Moon isn&#039;t to arrive at any grand destination. It&#039;s not to teach you a valuable lesson, and it&#039;s not to make you ponder anything long after you&#039;ve watched it. The point, plain and simple, is just to have fun. To give you 20 minutes of bright sun, good friends, and a warm feeling inside that will hopefully brighten your day. This is absolutely the kind of show you can rewatch episodes of, not because you may have missed something the first time, but just because you want that Sun and Moon feeling again.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;ve been holding out on trying Sun and Moon for whatever reason, be that the art style change, different cast, or change of tone, I urge you to give it a chance. If you tried the show out but found yourself put off by it, maybe a change in mindset will help you enjoy it. <br />
<br />
Try to remember when you first got into the Pokemon anime. I&#039;m sure most of us were kids, and while we no doubt enjoyed the action and liked whatever characters we grew up with, the reason Pokemon is so beloved the world over is because the world of Pokemon is just inherently fun. It&#039;s nice to be transported to a world where the biggest thing you have to worry about is how you&#039;ll get your pet dog to evolve into a wolf, and going to school is a great time where you learn about the things you love.<br />
<br />
Sun and Moon certainly won&#039;t appeal to everyone, but if you can still remember that childlike wonder of first discovering Pokemon, if you want to be taken to a tropical island with some pleasant company for awhile, if you&#039;re interested in seeing consistently great and inventive sakuga, or if you&#039;re just in the mood for some good, clean fun, then you&#039;ll have the time of your life with Pokemon Sun and Moon. <br />

    Pokemon Sun &amp; Moon is a weird story, its simultaneously widely hated and widely loved, so much so that its existence itself divided the Pokemon community into two halfs, &quot;SM Stans&quot; and &quot;XY Stans&quot;.<br />
Personally while I love and appreciate the XY Series as well, Sun and Moon is just on a whole another league for me.<br />
After 20 long years of being on air, the Pokemon anime found itself a formula that it applied on every series, whenever the games came out, Ash went to the region said games are set and, traveled around the region, made friends, caught new Pokemon, collected badges and lost the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321348">
        league, this is the &quot;basic plot&quot; of Pokemon summed up in one sentence, even when this is done well as is the case in the XY Series, watching the same formula again and again got repetitive in my opinion.<br />
Sun and Moon, while retaining the core themes and concepts of the previous seasons, took a very different approach, Ash didn&#039;t travel, he did make new friends but those were his &quot;classmates&quot;, Yes, he went to School, he didn&#039;t collect gym badges as there are no gyms in the Alola Region but he did participate in the Island trials, so here are my thoughts.<br />
<br />
Characters : 8/10<br />
The Sun and Moon Series, despite having a way bigger cast than the previous seasons, developed each and every member in some way or another which I didn&#039;t think was possible for the Pokemon anime, Ash himself didn&#039;t get &quot;reset&quot; like he did in the Best Wishes series, he very much retained his skills which manifested in the XY Series, but one problem I had with XY&#039;s characterization of Ash is that outside of battles, he was quite stale. Sun and Moon fixed that, they made him childish and goofy while still badass and serious, a perfect mix.<br />
<br />
Story : 9/10<br />
The series has no &quot;main story&quot; all the small arcs and episodes build up to give us a really great Pokemon experience. Lillie&#039;s growth from a girl who is afraid of Pokemon and had problems with her family to battling her own brother in the Pokemon League and mastering a Z move was quite fascinating to see.<br />
Other characters like Sophocles, Kiawe and Lana got growth as well, Mallow despite being a okay character didn&#039;t get much development but she got an amazing episode which was episode 108, what shined was how the stories were connected to the main cast, we already talked about Lillie&#039;s story, that same story developed Lusamine, Gladion in more ways than one, that story itself made Gladion Ash&#039;s rival.<br />
Other small arcs like The Guzzlord and Zeraora mini arc or the return of Brock and Misty were really fun to see. It was really sweet to see all the interactions and relationship the characters shared, from the father and son dynamic Ash and Kukui had to Guzma who was sorta like a &quot;dark version&quot; of Ash, who quit his dreams after facing failures too many times.<br />
<br />
Animation : 7/10<br />
The new artstyle which cause a lot of controversy especially because of the look of Ash was implemented to enhance the character&#039;s movements by making the designs simplistic with less shading and details, the animators&#039; job became a lot easier as opposed to the well detailed designs of XY, while this sounds good on paper and the character animation did factually improve a lot, the battles for some reason were lackluster in terms of animation, despite being well written if a battle looks boring, it loses a lot of points, why do you think people like Ash vs Kukui? it was well written AND well animated, the next series is also taking this simplistic artstyle approach but my only hope is the battles look as good as the character animation does which is honestly amazing and the best in Sun and Moon. The backgrounds too look the best out of any series prior to it.<br />
<br />
Music : 10/10<br />
Nothing to say, Pokemon, be it the anime or the games, never disappoints with music, from beautiful remixes of games&#039; tracks to original tracks, Shinji Miyazaki is consistently amazing, this was his last series as the music scorer of Pokemon Anime, next series its Yuku Hayashi who is amazing as well (he did the score for My Hero Academia)<br />
<br />
Overall : 9/10<br />
Sun and Moon is just fun, it has a lot of ups and downs but which series doesn&#039;t? ignore the artstyle and give it a try, you won&#039;t be disappointed,<br />
<br />

    Man, this anime has been a fun ride for me. Initially, I hated the anime the moment I saw how Ash was designed which was like 3 years ago, then I thought let&#039;s give it a shot. After like 10-15 eps I gave up the anime for a really long time because at that time I was more into shonen anime and SuMo anime wasn&#039;t my cup of tea. I had questions also like why would Ash want to go POKEMON SCHOOL after travelling 6 REGIONS wherein he won 48 gym badges (8x6, do the math) and competed in 6 Pokemon Leagues and why wouldn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321424">
        you go an adventure like you did for 6 regions? <br />
<br />
So many questions, then after I heard that Gladion, Nebby made entries into the anime, I kinda kept up with it due to previews of next eps however slice of life still wasnt my cup of tea. Also I knew about these characters because I played the SuMo and USUM games and because of that I could watch the episodes here and there which contained some adventure, however thanks to their power ranger ripoff which was cringey to me I kinda narrowed down on eps to avoid thanks to people revealing the spoilers of next episodes on YT.<br />
<br />
However, this Summer I kinda wanted to watch something light hearted cuz I watched a lot of heavy shonen anime and I don;t know I just wanted more variety so I decided let&#039;s watch SuMo anime without skipping this time that too during my rewatch which I started on October 4th and was also watching the Alola League side by side.<br />
<br />
I am on the 22nd episode of my rewatch, and gotta say its been fun so far.....Oooof so many words dont want to be that other user who added 4200 words into it.....so will leave you to this that this pokemon series addresses a lot of deep themes on life for a kids anime like death (ep 21) <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;ll say this that I will try to finish SuMo rewatch before Galar arc for sure because it&#039;s just 12 days away now at the time I write this review and Bye Bye Alola you were awesome ( I know that its just I need to see the missed eps)<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall it&#039;s an 8.5/10 for me but here there&#039;s no 8.5/10 so the 0.5 is for Bewear who made chuckle EVERY DAMN TIME!<br />
<br />
THANKS AGAIN ALOLA!!! HOPE TO SEE SOME OF THESE CHARACTERS IN GALAR TOO IN SOME FORM!<br />
<br />

    Gotta catch em all,<br />
<br />
Let me just start the review by giving a very basic explaintion to the series. Ash goes to new region to become pokemon master...basically it’s the same as every other season except it’s in a new region!! AKA the Aloha Region <br />
<br />
Now one thing I will say is the animation, this was a hard one for me at first because I hated how Ash looked but my final conclusion, it’s Refreshing with new animations. A lot of people hate it. I hated it. But after staring at new design in shock for a few hours, I got used to it. And honestly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363119">
        I like the new design for Ash.<br />
<br />
Apart from ash the new Region and characters is simply beautiful, the animation really does bring it to life and it’s deserves all the praise it gets, all the Pokemon look the part and it keeps you invested to see more of the region.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the big down side to this anime is the plot, unfortunately for long stretches there is none and that’s a big problem in all of Pokemon not just this anime<br />
<br />
BUT! any episode with plot is always great to watch and the ending of this anime is one of the best endings to Pokemon I have ever seen and it’s one of the big reasons that got me so hooked to the series/games again <br />
<br />
My final conclusion is this, if this is the new direction they are taking Pokemon I cannot wait to see how Pokemon (2019) or Pokemon journeys (however you want to say it) turns out. This series is defiantly worth a watch and it’s a great way to get back into the world of Pokemon

    May contain very minor spoilers that won&#039;t affect your watching experience. If by any chance you didn&#039;t like it then message me and I will edit it out.<br />
<br />
First up the Story is more or less the same, about a 10 year old boy named Satoshi aiming to be a Pokemon Master. Usually Satoshi collects gym badges and enters the league, but this time it&#039;s different . Satoshi&#039;s new adventure is on a island with new pokemon and new friends. I&#039;m not going to explain the plot anymore because I don&#039;t want to ruin anyones experience. The story improves significantly in time, but you have to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241603">
        get used to the changes at your own pace. it look me 3 episodes to get used to for example.<br />
<br />
The most noticeable change in Sun &amp; Moon is the animation style. This change is the most criticized, after all Satoshi was starting to look much more mature in XYZ. Yes, he looks much more of a kid, but how old is he? 15? 16? No, he is 10. He&#039;s been 10 since 1997. This criticism is very annoying. Anyhow, the animation suits the setting very well and also makes it more funny.<br />
<br />
The soundtracks suit the battling very well, not to mention the funny moments. The opening song is addicting and the ending song is amazing. For Pokemon you don&#039;t have to worry about the sound of the music or alike.<br />
<br />
Every individual character has their own personality. Their personality is what makes the show entertaining. For example, Lillie is too afraid to touch Pokemon. The characters design works well with the plot and everything else.<br />
<br />
I love Sun &amp; Moon to bits. It&#039;s my life right now. #1 favourite anime at the moment and will stay that way. The reasons I love it is because of the comedy, animation, new pokemon and Z-Powers.<br />
<br />
Satoshi going to school wasn&#039;t the anime fault, it&#039;s the game. If you don&#039;t like it then consult nintendo. A change is not always bad, in this case it is perfect. Seeing Satoshi Lose in the league again and again wasn&#039;t exactly the best anyway .<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading and give Sun &amp; Moon a try. I will prob edit in a few months. I haven&#039;t checked for errors.<br />

    In the Pokemon anime series, it’s common among the fans about the quality of each series that varies and changes from each other, where it’s lowering from the Indigo season to the Johns season, starting picking up a little with Advance, goes higher with DP, dropping low in BW and then going back high with XY. So when I started watching Sun and Moon (SM for short) it’s inventible to ask if it continued XY quality, or dropped it. The answer Is kinda surprising: it’s neither.<br />
<br />
To understand why I’m saying that, I will explain some introduction - Pokemon SM games were actually the first for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396491">
        a long time in the Pokemon franchise that tried to do something new - making “new” format with the games. New format doesn’t mean there’s no Pokemon training but spinoff kinda thing, but taking the games in another way of presenting the old familiar adventure - not only the region structure, but the game drastically changes the adventure. Instead of going from town X to town Y, the player needs to go through varies a variety of challenges and trials scattered along the islands, and though of course it&#039;s about Pokemon and battling, they present another way of handling our beloved creatures in more challenging and interesting ways presented in the trials, in other words: there are no gyms here, only “final boss” in the name of Kahuna of the island. In the map area, there are no more towns but 4 islands where the player is gonna play a full play time on them. So when OLM went to adapt the games, it was inventible to make a new format for the anime as well - Ash once again reaches our new region Alola which contains once again new Pokemon, new friends, new challenges and etc , but as the game map isn’t big as mentioned, you can’t handle the same way of travelling in SM but creating “new” format for the games. The producers of the anime probably were sitting hours in their planning meeting to know how to handle the less adventure “feel” and the smaller map of Alola to create a long-run Pokemon anime, and then they reached a kinda silly conclusion - why don’t we send Ash back to school?<br />
<br />
Yeah, it’s just as you heard, now that the map isn’t big, and the same element of adventure can’t be done, there’s need to create a new format of Pokemon where Ash goes back and forth to the same place during the time he is supposed to train, catch, make new friends, and learn about the new generation of Pokemon. The only way they found how to make it works is getting him back to Pokemon school after he almost won the Galos league in XY, to learn about types, evolution and stuff that all of us know already from the age of 6 when we watched the Indigo season, and surely Ash does know already. Kinda ridiculous isn’t it?<br />
<br />
But is this ruining Pokemon? It’s actually not, Ash is still training and catching some Pokemon, aiming to be Pokemon master by winning the challenges, battling the Kahunas, and spending his time with his Pokemon of course (how can Pokemon be without that?). Obviously Ash makes new friends. In fact, the main cast in SM is the biggest yet, if ‘till now he traveled with groups of 3-4 people now he have 5 new friends to the main cast besides the recurring returning characters, so there’s lot of room for character development for each of them. So though there’s a new kind of format for Pokemon episodes - Ash maybe stays in the same place and doesn’t have much of “Pokemon adventure”, but he still does his Pokemon training and catching thingy like all Pokemon series. So, what wrong with SM? <br />
<br />
To explain it, I will start with what is good in SM - in fact, though the episodic format, SM have maybe more story arcs than most of Pokemon series, the first of them that features the legendaries Pokemon - Ultra Beasts in fact, was one of the best to my taste and made a really good impression, and there’s more of them, some of them maybe not in the level of the first one but still entertaining. Well, maybe except one which made me cringe so much. Ash still behaving as he should be after the XY series, though he kinda acts like he is in vacation from time to time, he still makes a good impression with creative training (literally) and variety of Pokemon that we haven’t seen him holding yet. <br />
<br />
The problem is maybe the common episodes in every Pokemon series - the “fillers” of the Pokemon anime were never really good, they always had some formula of the same pattern, some trainer and his Pokemon, annoying team rocket and stuff, unless there were good events in those episodes that developed the characters or the story they were always average. You would say - in SM it would be the same, average episodes and all. But no, SM taking a new level in “filler” episodes, making the most bizarre and strange stories about what’s not. even in the lousy Johto season there wasn’t that low level of stories. There’s truly here and there some golden ones, and even in the strangest episodes there was one good cute or funny moment, but those episodes was my no.1 cause to watch SM in very long times with lots of breaks, mostly due the feeling I’m wasting my time. And I won’t even start talking about the Power Rangers thingy they made, true that the some stories of the Ultra Beasts were good but the Power Rangers approach  was really annoying and pointless. <br />
<br />
Thing is, those low level quality episodes don’t come at any specific time like they usually do, they are scattered all over the place, between the story arcs and sometimes even created long run of those episodes without stopping. This situation made me think that the writers of SM were not the same for the whole series. Unlike previous Pokemon series, yeah even the bad ones, had consecutive level of writing, SM doesn’t seem to have this, there’s some really good high level stories here and there, some good story arcs, there’s the usual average episodes, and there’s some really low written episodes like each writer took turns to write his own episode. <br />
<br />
So the above question - is SM continuing the level of XY, or is it lowering it? Answer: neither, it  has some really high peaks in the story with good training and battle episodes and some good story arcs, but some stories and even one arc that makes you cringe, SM truly has more ups and downs than most of Pokemon series. <br />
<br />
But still, the good stories of SM are what is holding it so it won’t go down, whenever I  remember  the good character development and some arcs, and some of the battles that remind me of the XY battles, it makes me think good of SM. So though all the complaining, I still like SM story, though it&#039;s not one of my favourites for being inconsistent. <br />
<br />
Final note: about the Z-rings in SM, though I really appreciate how OLM has done them, but they had the annoying thing of clashing moves together from the first seasons, and instead of using the Z-moves in interesting ways we would except, they are only doing them for the thrilling blasting and stuff and not for the real purpose, making Z-moves feel like useless addition and not tactical and powerful attacks. Some of the Z-moves battles were okay though and the problem is starting only little later on in the series. Still, the Mega-Evolution in XY was much better used than Z- moves, while in the games Z-moves are supposed to be a better upgrade than Mega-Evolution. <br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
<br />
As I mentioned, Ash definitely doesn’t change a lot in SM from XY, his design maybe returned to be childish and caricature, and sometimes acting as he is in vacation, but he still has lots of confidence and love for his Pokemon, training and raising them with love and care, and aiming of course to be the strongest and the best. Maybe he’s not the same kind of mentor he was in XY, but he didn’t dropped to BW lvl1 trainer. The only complain on Ash is the usual complain of being corny and cringe, in XY since he had some “mentor” rule that characteristic kinda disappeared, OLM made sure In SM that we will remember he still has that. <br />
<br />
Now, as I said, there’s a really big cast of characters, I will try to say the important stuff on the important characters, though there’s literally a lot, so I will mention only the regular ones. <br />
<br />
Prof. Kukui - it might sound surprising, but yeah. Prof. Kukui is not only the professor in SM but he is regular and main character here, his part in the series is not that big but he’s interesting enough to steal the show from time to time. What’s making Kukui special In SM more is the fact that he’s kinda serving as father-model to Ash, which is adding quite a lot to the anime. (Especially for the fact that he doesn’t have a shirt...) <br />
<br />
Lillie - Lillie is actually the only character in the anime that is actually based on her character from the game. The only difference is that they took her in some other way at the start of the series, at start it was a little strange but that direction actually made her character deeper than in the games, not only at the start of the series but also later on she has the most deep characteristic and the most development in SM, so I gotta give credit to OLM to how they handled her character, though I would love to see more closing to the game adaption than this (in terms of ideology), and maybe less annoying. <br />
<br />
Gladion - Must say about Gladion, he makes the show pretty damn good, at least when he’s showing up and acting as Ash’s rival in SM. He is definitely raising the series level when he’s there with his style. But his uniqueness in the series kinda fades away toward the end, really too bad but still one of the good characters here. <br />
<br />
With the follow characters, the anime took some of the anime characters from the trials and made them main characters, some of them were a hit-or-miss, some went pretty good. In the anime version they are acting as Ash’s classmates and friends to the region: <br />
Mallow - Kinda good character, she has good development but not much along the series, and though to be non-annoying she’s my least favourite due to her very little role in the development of the anime. <br />
Kiawe - Truly one of the annoying characters, but still better than the next one. Kiawe truly feels more like Ash’s rival in the series and still keeps being likeable unlike Ash’s previous rivals, he has development and golden moments here and there, but it felt as he had unused potential that turned into annoyance. <br />
Sophocles - Yeah this one was totally pointless, had a kind of development along the series, but his childish behaviour and goals just doesn’t make sense to me in the Pokemon world. I understand the need to adapt his character, but OLM really failed in this one.<br />
Lana -She’s actually my favourite character in SM, she had true goals, some good Pokemon battle scenes, good development, though not to be kinda deep as Lillie, she still was one of the best characters here.<br />
 <br />
Oh and I can’t forget - Team Rocket, Jessie and James and Mewoth feel much less annoying in SM, and have some serious comedy upgrade that ‘till the end made me laugh with tears. They might still wants Pikachu, still want to annoy anyone, but they are doing a much better job on that in SM that makes their appearance being comparable to their BW appearance, though I still like their BW role more. The annoying thing about Team Rocket in SM is their motto being replaced, wish they hadn&#039;t done that. I understand OLM needs to renew things but that was really pointless and not catchy. <br />
<br />
Characters: 7/10<br />
<br />
The art at the start might be intimidating, it’s not clear at first if they wanted higher animation and art quality or making it more childish. The truth is, after a couple of episodes you start to get why they chose this “light” art, though to stand out on the other Pokemon series it’s great and engaging, and though Ash looks again child and Team Rocket designs look weird, it has the best art the Pokemon series can offer (‘till SM at least, didn’t watched Journeys yet). <br />
<br />
The animation get upgrade as well, there’s still some annoying reused frames, but some or even most of the battles are animated well enough to show how Pokemon anime adaption should be. <br />
<br />
The OST is still great (to Pokemon), and even surprising at times. The openings were weird though, I understand the need to fit the “Alola” theme and all, but they didn’t feel as a Pokemon opening, it’s not making them less good though. The voice cast was okay, except for Lillie’s English voice that was annoying (and maybe what made her annoying to me). Kinda weird at the start to hear Ash’s “mature” voice in his new design, but as I got used to the animation I got used to this as well.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation - 8/10<br />
OST &amp; Voice cast: 7/10<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
SM is truly one of the good Pokemon series, it may have serious problems and have the most downhills and inconsistent story in the Pokemon long running series, but the good stories, the animation and the OST are making SM one of the good ones. For me at least it’s better than BW and Johto season, but it cannot be compared to XY/DP and even the Advance series where Ash is really developing, in SM he maybe still continues to get stronger as a trainer but he doesn’t develop much from when he was in XY and kinda feels stuck in a region of kids in school than taking challenges and forgetting his goal, even the Pokemon league wasn’t serious (in the term of league I mean, the battles were great). But after all, it’s Pokemon, and I’m fan of it and I enjoyed it, so who am I to complain? Those who love Pokemon have to watch SM, and even when strange and bizarre stories such as Power Rangers style gonna show up, true fans will stick to it ‘till the end where more good stuff are showing, it’s worth the effort of 146 episodes. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />

    [SPOILERS]<br />
<br />
Wow, I did not expect this to make me nearly cry.<br />
<br />
Better yet, at the time, this was my first time watching the Pokémon anime since 2014.<br />
<br />
But, damn, is this show actually pretty fucking amazing. I’m surprised that this show- THIS show that was mocked by the community when it was announced... would become not only my favourite anime, but also win the hearts of many who previously despised it.<br />
<br />
Let’s cut the shit: This is no way the best anime I’ve seen. But, it is my favourite. (If you watch Schaffrillas Productions’ Best Animated Feature video, he says that The Incredibles is a better film than

          <span style="display: none;" id="review351912">
        Spirited Away, but the latter is his favourite.)<br />
<br />
The cons are as follows: <br />
<br />
- Inconsistent Pacing<br />
- Some characters don’t get enough time in the spotlight<br />
- Ash’s design<br />
<br />
Pacing can honestly be a mixed bag. Sometimes, episodes can feel slow. Other times, they go too fast for your liking. Pacing does somewhat improve in the later episodes, but it can throw off your groove.<br />
<br />
Seriously, some characters get thrown under the bus. Other than Ash, Pikachu, Team Rocket, and Professor Kukui, the classmates I found to be well-developed were Mallow and Kiawe. I like Lillie, but she got way too much development with no goal in the end. Lana is just eh, and don’t get me started on Sophocles (he’s not that good...)<br />
<br />
Ash’s. Design. In. The. First. Half. Sucked. Although XYZ refined Ash’s appearance and honestly gave us his most impactful and memorable design (before Journeys), he looked kinda dumb and a bit of a goof. At least later on he looked way better and began to mesh well with the world more.<br />
<br />
NOW ITS PRO TIME:<br />
<br />
The animation IS AMAZING. OLM is honestly an underrated studio and should be respected more for their work. Sun and Moon did not hold back in the animation department. XYZ had 3-D Camera shit and CG backgrounds, but Sun and Moon said, “fuck that CG shit” and went mostly hand-drawn. There’s still some CG, but it’s not noticeable. The animation is smooth like butter and now, feels less stiff thanks to the art style change. Battles feel more lively and some ingenious camera work and character animation make it feel impactful. Even when the events are mundane, the animation still shows off the charm of life and breathes life into those scenes. Back to the battles, the final battle between Kukui and Ash offered THE single-best animated battle sequence in Pokémon’s 20-year history. But more on that later.<br />
<br />
The story is surprisingly fun despite the earlier pacing issues. Once you get down to it, it’s pretty good. But, once you understand the underlying context behind it, it gets real good. You see, for most of the time Ash and Pikachu are in a region, they don’t really take a good look at all the sights and sounds. However, since they’re forced on a specific island, this allows them to fully take in the wonderful region that is Alola. Compared to XY’s I GOTTA WIN story, SM’s approach is to slow down in life. It focuses on world-building rather than battling and it gives off a Ghibli vibe. It’s about the bond you share not only with your friend’s but with nature and the environment itself. You meet all these characters and, unlike previous seasons, they aren’t one-offs. They leave a profound impact on Ash and help him along his eventual journey and goal to travel the world. Once you realize you’re at the endgame... you realize that Ash will say goodbye to everyone, and you probably wouldn’t want that.<br />
<br />
Just like K-On told us that Graduation is not the end and Assassination Classroom told us to look towards the future, Pokemon Sun and Moon tell us that your family is closer than you think and will always stick by your side, even when you come back. This gives way to a finale that’ll rock you to the core and will likely make you shed a tear or two.<br />
<br />
The music is BANGING. FEATURING SOME GREAT AND CATCHY OPENING SONGS AND SOME GOOD BOPS IN THE CLOSING, YOU’L BE BOPPING YOUR HEAD ALONG TO THE TUNES. Not only that, the background score by Shinji Miyazaki is excellent and a great send-off to his 20-year stint with Pokémon. Some highlights include Hau’oli City and Lillie’s Theme. <br />
<br />
Then we get to Type:Wild and the Battle against Kukui. And OH MY IS THIS ONE OF THE GREATEST ANIME CLIMAXES. IM NOT CRAZY, YOU ARE.<br />
<br />
The League in general was great at tying up arcs and made everyone (even Sophocles) grow as a character. However, the battle against Kukui is not only a culmination of the entire 146-episode show, but the show’s entire story up until that point.<br />
<br />
Ash’s Pokémon get more highlights and give way to some great Arc conclusions for some, but the fight with Pikachu and Tapu Koko single-handedly may be one of the most impactful climaxes in anime.<br />
<br />
For 20 years, Ash tried to win a league, but failed. It wasn’t until he beat Karma- I mean Gladion to secure the bag. He is the champion now, but this moment solidified why he’s the greatest trainer in history. To win the league, he used his Lycanroc, but to solidify himself as the strongest, he used his day-one buddy, Pikachu. To defeat the giant Tapu Koko, they used the memories they made over their time in Alola as a stepping stone into their untapped power. They culminate everything they learnt from studying Alola to this single Z-Move in order to overpower a god. In a Studio Trigger-esque sequence with ambitious panning shots, flashy visuals, guitar shredding, and a large focus of coming together as one, you could tell that the impact Ash and Pikachu made in not only in Alola, but anime in general was undeniable. He did not need a divine intervention. He did not need some flashy transformation. All Ash really needed was friends who would stick by him and a partner that created an everlasting bond with him. And most importantly, all he needed was just some fun under the sun.<br />
<br />
And that’s what Sun and Moon is: a story about bonding with nature and people.<br />
It has episodic arcs, it’s flashy, it’s wholesome, it’s a show that’s willing to tell stories that break the boundaries of Pokemon, it’s... fun.<br />
<br />
Honestly, Assassination Classroom, Little Witch Academia, and K-On will be fighting over which one is better in my anime list, but it will never top the fun I had with Sun and Moon.<br />
<br />
And that’s why i fucking love this show.<br />
<br />

    Once XY(&amp;Z) was ending, they started releasing trailers for Sun and Moon, I was looking at the optimistic side of things. Through my eyes I saw Sun and Moon trailing off of the XY series as a sort of &quot;calm before the storm&quot; if that makes any sense. After all the action that was brought by the previous season, the drama, the development, all the characters acting as one and thinking about the others, I felt Sun and Moon would be about Ash and him preparing for his next journey and learning what he could before his next big step into a new region and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251968">
        a new adventure. What I thought and what I&#039;ve been watching are two completely different things.<br />
<br />
I was enjoying it at first but as it went along I started losing interest. I looked at this installment of the series as a &quot;laid back time&quot; meaning that this wasn&#039;t going to be as serious as previous generations before it since the Alola region is such a relaxed and easy going place, but I never expected it to be so uninteresting. I wanted to see travelling between the groups. Going all over the island and learning new things. With the idea of school they could have done so much. Make every new unit take place on a different island (schools are on each island) or each new lesson is taught in a particular part of the island that it relates to.<br />
<br />
I understand this whole generation is going to be centered around school but I honestly don&#039;t like that. Having to try and relate with and enjoy characters isn&#039;t possible for a lot of us because of the way that the writers have been taking the series. In my view, Mallow is really the only one in the entire group who actually seems to care. It&#039;s almost like they took Ash from XY and copy/pasted him into Mallow and just gave the Sun and Moon Ash a completely new personality. <br />
<br />
I want to go back to something like XY or Diamond and Pearl. We saw just how well they could write the characters and develop them. Sure there were a few dull moments but I&#039;m sure each and every one of us can say that the following episodes that were not filler always made up for it. Hell, even the fillers at times were amazing. I want to have that feeling where every week when I watch an episode, I can leave it to last on my list because it&#039;s the one I&#039;m looking most forward to. With the maybe 3-5 anime that update on Thursdays that I&#039;m watching, Sun and Moon is always the first and I just say &quot;let&#039;s get it over with&quot;. I want the feeling where I can come back and wait letting the suspense build up and finally watching the episode and then thinking about how good it was for the rest of the night. <br />
<br />
If I ever watch a Sun and Moon episode now, at the end I&#039;m either thinking &quot;Why the hell is Ash so annoying? Seriously can you just act like you used to?&quot; or &quot;That was boring... Only decent thing that happened was Mallow actually attempting to get everybody to participate...&quot; THIS IS NOT WHAT THE SHOW IS ABOUT.<br />
<br />
Pokemon is a show about Ash who is setting out on his journey to be a Pokemon master while along the way he meets new people, makes new friends and learns from everyone. Sun and Moon doesn&#039;t include any of this. Kiawe for example could have had such a big role if they did not make him so annoying. He was the only one who had a Z-Ring when Ash first came here and he could have taught Ash and actually been a rival if they wrote Ash to have the same personality he once did. Lillie was supposed to have the largest role in the group seeing how she was the main characters in the games except now she barely does anything other than playing the role of an &quot;informant&quot; supplying the main characters with useful information as well as the &quot;tragic heroine&quot; since she can&#039;t touch Pokemon, other than Vulpix/Shiron, and always needs help from others. Lana is just meh. There&#039;s nothing to great about her other than the rare moments where she shines. And then Sophocles is just- *throws up*.<br />
<br />
What I&#039;m trying to say is that this series is nothing like a Pokemon series. This just feels like some random slice of life/fantasy/school life/comedy crap about a group of kids who just met some random kid who is hyper and they run around with their pets and one of the people in the group of kids is scared of pets so the others keep pushing their pets onto the one that&#039;s scared of pets so she won&#039;t be scared anymore. Then one of the kids is trying to get them to stop and have them all work together or make everything fun for them and they are the only one that leaves any impact on us. Then there is the hyper kid who comes there with nothing and then gets an OP power up and then one of the other kids who has an OP power up tells him that he has to be really strong to use that power up until the pet that gave the hyper kid that power up toys with him and says &quot;lets show this snot nosed brat what you can do&quot; and then they fight but the hyper kid doesn&#039;t win but still shows up the cocky snot nosed brat. Then the story continues for 25-27 episodes until SOMETHING GOOD FINALLY HAPPENS and then we have to wait god knows how long until something good happens again.<br />
<br />
What a Pokemon series should have is what we&#039;ve seen in every other region (besides black and white... Let&#039;s just not mention that). It should be a sense of a team where they treat each other like a family member. A group of 6 just doesn&#039;t work out. It just feels like they&#039;re classmates with no relationship whatsoever. Everyone should enjoy being with everyone, wanting to spend time with each other and learn from everyone or help each other. Have a sense that wherever one goes, the other goes and makes the journey/even a little bit more interesting. Everyone should have a goal or dream they are striving to get and actually show DEVELOPMENT TOWARDS THE DREAM OR GOAL. <br />
<br />
Sun and Moon from my eyes is not a &quot;Pokemon Series&quot;. It&#039;s a lazy attempt at trying to appeal to an audience that is just not interested. Unless I can see a light in this very, very dark and dim place that the anime is currently in then I&#039;ll keep my nose out of it and continue to watch something that actually has me wanting more.

    Here&#039;s the thing with Sun and Moon. If you&#039;re going into this after watching XYZ, and expecting it to be similar in any way. Don&#039;t. This show isn&#039;t anything like that. And to be fair, it isn&#039;t TRYING to be anything like that.<br />
<br />
For this season (or region, or whatever), the show takes on a more slice of life style, and as a slice of life show, it is decent. You have some likeable characters, each with their own personalities, and they&#039;re all in a school. Why is Satoshi (Ash) in a school? IDK, but don&#039;t question it.<br />
Now, although the characters are decent to begin with,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321317">
        after 146 episodes, you would expect them to like. Change. But that doesn&#039;t really happen as much as I would have liked. We do get some decent development through Lillie, and to be honest, this show would have been a lot more engaging if there was a more prominent overarching arc about her and her family. (Like seriously? There was so much being hinted at with her family, BUT it just doesn&#039;t end up being talked about). The other characters don&#039;t really get too much development, instead choosing to solve small problems that they have, but not too much else (I.e., one character is afraid of the dark so… his electric mouse lights up. Solid development I guess)<br />
<br />
The biggest change is clearly the animation, so I&#039;ll briefly touch on that. It&#039;s worse, but it&#039;s still alright. Satoshi&#039;s design is kind of annoying at first, but it&#039;s not really a big deal. In all honesty, it fits very well with the intended slice of life format, so it&#039;s not really something to hold against this show.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem for me is the actual story/plot. I know I&#039;m saying that it&#039;s more slice of life, so like. This shouldn&#039;t be a problem. But it&#039;s really missing that little something that makes pokemon, pokemon. So we no longer have gym battles, and instead have the island challenges. What are these island challenges? That&#039;s kinda the problem. I DON&#039;T REMEMBER. Nothing about this is memorable. I NEVER remembered how many of these challenges he had completed, or even what he did to get them. This is mostly my own fault for having a bad memory, but I really feel that it could have been done in a better way. Maybe the fact that the school setting is there throughout is part of the problem. I don&#039;t really know. (as in, the fact that the setting is the same for most of the series makes it easier to kind of mesh everything together and not remember as much as I would have liked to)<br />
(There&#039;s also another problem that I have with the story, but I won&#039;t go into it as it would involve too many spoilers)<br />
<br />
Overall, although there seems to be something lacking in this series, it does do a good job at what it&#039;s attempting to actually do. And don&#039;t get me wrong, there were many, many enjoyable moments throughout the series. If you go into this KNOWING that it will essentially be a slice of life, then this will definitely be a very good and enjoyable show, so if after reading this, you think you might be interested, then you should definitely watch it! The issue for me is that I didn&#039;t want this to be what it is, because I don&#039;t feel as though this is what pokemon SHOULD be. But don&#039;t let that stop you! (Unless you&#039;re like me, in which case, let it stop you. Although if you are like me, you&#039;ll be watching it anyways).<br />
<br />
See you all in Galar!

    As a Pokemon fan,i watched almost all the movies and some of the series.I love Sun and Moon because its different from the other Pokemon series.That&#039;s why some people don&#039;t like it and some people love it.Its not for all people,in my case,i just wanted something different from all the series.The story,is not the best, i liked it overrall but sometimes it doesnt make sense.The art is the best in my opinion,Alola has a very good design,a tropical beautiful region.The sound are also very good,in my opinion the best so far.The character is the thing i kind of dislike.There are too much characters.Some of them,just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362923">
        dont make sense,and they sounld&#039;nt exist.Also,Ash is different,a more comedic appearance than the other series,where Ash was more competitive.As for enjoyment,i like it for most of the time,there are just some weird episodes but in rest i just love it.In my opinion the best pokemon series ever done.

    I told myself not to do this but I&#039;m going to do this anyways. When reading this, please keep in mind the following:<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve skipped around a lot with what episodes I watched. I did however watch all of the last 30ish episodes. All my current thoughts are directed towards the ending of the league and how I feel about it versus what happened/should have happened (imo) with XYZ and D/P.<br />
<br />
So due to that, obvious spoilers for D/P, XYZ, and Sun and Moon incoming.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m part of that group that really feels like the writing ruined Pokemon as a whole with not only the conclusion of XYZ

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317429">
        but also Diamond/Pearl. With D/P, we saw Ash at probably his best he has ever been at. He was proving to Paul over and over again how important love and care was to battling and his team was extremely well-balanced. Him losing that league was not a huge issue but some would argue it was. I&#039;m neutral about it; the big win was him overcoming Paul.<br />
<br />
In XYZ however, EVERYTHING pointed to Ash finally having everything he needed to win. The writing in this season pointed to Ash being calm and collected. It was obvious to anyone watching that he was on a bar much higher than anyone he was encountering leading up to the league. I will say that one fault he had was his over reliance on Greninja. It reminded me of the first season when Ash failed in the Pokemon League due to his over reliance of Charizard. However, it is not a completely apples to apples comparison since Greninja showed respect towards Ash while Charizard did not. Getting back on point, the writers gave clear indication that Ash was in the state of mind with the resources needed to win the league. Then out of left field, some dude with (at least) 3 legendary Pokemon wipes him out in the final. There is no poetic answer here; the writers decided to crap on all the character development Ash had leading up to this point. I would argue that there was 20 YEARS of character development leading up to this point.<br />
<br />
To add onto this, in this season, we saw arguably the most cannon relationship you&#039;ll see in Pokemon with Serena. The way they concluded their time together as well as the childhood friend plot point just hammers the notion that the show should have ended with them, at least in some way, showing that they&#039;ll stick together. In my opinion, what makes the most sense given the writing I&#039;ve seen, is that Ash should have won the league, finally finishing his quest. With that, he sticks with Serena as she continues on with hers becoming a full support role. Serena was there for Ash all this time, he would then do the same for her since his quest was finally over.<br />
<br />
Now moving onto the crux of all of this, Ash winning the Sun/Moon league. I had been loosely keeping up with the show, watching episodes here and there. I however for the past couple of weeks have been keeping up with the league episodes for Sun and Moon. Ash winning this league feels like a huge cop out. All of this character development is gone, he didn&#039;t even have a full team, and he is arguably at his worst battle sense wise in the series. I don&#039;t understand why the writers would give him this achievement now. The moment that makes the most sense is in XYZ and if not there, D/P.<br />
<br />
Let me take the time now to talk about the drastic change in visual style this show employed. Leading up to Sun and Moon, we had arguably the best comprise of animation versus artstyle in XYZ. The studio had achieved gorgeous and model accurate artwork while allowing the scenes that really need movement (the battle stuff) to have that fluidity. Yes the stuff outside of could and usually was pretty stiff. However, it was by no means hard to look at. It was a great comprise. With Sun and Moon, the studio decided to go into a bold and new direction. The artstyle was, in my opinion, downgraded to be more simple and expressive. This allowed the studio to go &quot;off model&quot; more often which speeds up the animation process. However, like with something such as Konosuba season 2, it is not to my liking because it can, in many instances, look like utter garbage. Yes it is expressive because that&#039;s one way to gain that effect; make the characters go over dramatic and really show their emotions. However, there needs to be a baseline that is present. Sun and Moon went too far into this new direction and it really hurts the brand in my opinion. The studio was working towards this drawn and cgi hybrid system for the past 10 or so years and it came to its apex in XYZ. With Sun and Moon going completely in a different direction, I cannot help but believe it was a silly mistake. If you like it, great. However it is an eye sore to watch. <br />
<br />
The VAs are annoying but that&#039;s because the show is targeted to kids. Kids love loud, in-your-face type stuff. I don&#039;t. When there is suitable emotion, I liked it.     <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not going to say something silly like I&#039;m legit mad about this. I just find it so disappointing that all the pieces were there in the last series to have a seriously amazing conclusion to a +20 year journey. The state of mind was there, the team was there, the hardwork was there, and the (and I cannot believe I am saying this about Pokemon) romance element was there. It was all there in XYZ to give Ash the ending he deserved. Instead, we got this. It makes more sense to have had Ash win XYZ then act the exact same in Sun and Moon since, hey he just won the league time for a vacation. It seems like a pretty big dickslap to the fans.

    Pokemon is becoming like that drunk brother you keep hoping would get sober someday, but never did, so you stuck with him for years like a fool. Then one day you realize that things will never change.<br />
<br />
Even with its best season, Pokemon XY, I was still reminded constantly of just how little substance there was in the plot. It could be summed down to, &quot;Bad things happen. Protagonist doesn&#039;t give up. The power of hope and love wins.&quot; Basically, every typical shounen plot, ever. The repetitive formula became even worse when mixed with the slow-paced slice-of-life genre in Sun &amp; Moon, a genre which doesn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305321">
        work for many people, myself included. Do note that I&#039;m not saying shounen anime in itself is bad; it just so happens to not be the kind of anime I could enjoy or tolerate any longer. <br />
<br />
Pokemon Sun &amp; Moon sees our never-aging protagonist, Ash Ketchum, landing in yet another new region, Alola. He meets new friends and Pokemon, but this time, he&#039;s no longer pursuing his childhood dream of &quot;being the best that no one ever was,&quot; and instead chooses to settle for a more peaceful school life full of hijinks and quirky comedic antics. Basically the perfect plot for 7 year olds. So don&#039;t be mistaken - Pokemon is essentially a show for kids, now more than ever. In spite of its TWO episodes with more mature themes (which are still family-friendly parables designed to teach children about the meaning of death anyway), it&#039;s not really the &quot;darker and grittier&quot; kind of show some have exaggerated. It&#039;s Pokemon, a shounen show where the power of friendship triumphs over logic. Whereas the previous seasons had the excuse of being entertaining with its more fast-paced battle scenes, those moments are now few and far between, replaced by cutesy moments of Ash and his friends fooling around with whatever Pokemon they wish to market for the day. Basically your average filler episode of Pokemon filled up to 90% of the season.<br />
<br />
The characters are written decently enough, but I didn&#039;t watch Pokemon for some deeply complex characters; I watched it for the epic fight scenes that were once prevalent in XY. Decent and functional character writing just isn&#039;t good enough to cut it for my entertainment. Most of the characters are written in such a way as to teach about familial bonds and not giving up in the face of failure anyway; basically your average shounen moral lessons for 7 year olds. They are characters designed to educate children about the most generic and basic form of humanity, the kind that have been seen many times over in thousands of other shounen anime. Unless you&#039;re some Pokemon superfan, you&#039;d find yourself spending your time much better watching far more quality and original writing elsewhere.

    Now I dont think ive ever been more annoyed to watch something that is so dear to me. <br />
Lets jump right into this dumpster fire<br />
<br />
The story is an 8/10. This is the only part of sun and moon that I actually enjoy. I think the story of alola was one of the best ones (at least by the game standards) and having it animated was slightly exciting. UNTIL I SAW THE ARTSTYLE<br />
<br />
1/10 is complementing. This is just gross to look at and its not even all the characters, iTS JUST ASH. He looks like atrocious in every way. The other characters and pokemon look great

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279627">
        but ash... oh boy does he look like the largest Cleveland steamer. <br />
<br />
The sound is a 3/10. If they found a way to match the SM/USUM soundtrack into the show (now I know games are separate but the music was amazing.) it would have a higher score but since the music blows it gets a 3.<br />
<br />
Dear God if I could put 0/10 I would in a heartbeat. Once again ash looks like shit. Lana, Mallow, Lillie, Kiawe, Fatass and kukui look good and if ASH didnt exist id probably give the characters a 7/10. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment is a 2. Id rather my dog shit out a sock than watch this. Now i know that might be an over-exaggeration but its just a poor sad excuse for a show with the status of pokemon. <br />
<br />
Overall this show is a 5. Its horrible. Dont feed your kids on this.

    Once you get used to the artstyle, you&#039;ll see a really great Pokémon series.<br />
<br />
It sure is mostly comedy, a real change of pace compared to XY(&amp;Z) Minus the pokémon names jokes, it&#039;s usually nice comedy.<br />
<br />
Where Sun &amp; Moon shines the most, it&#039;s through it&#039;s characters. The cast is vibrant, full of personality.<br />
<br />
The show really shines when it tries to be serious; there&#039;s a whole episode dealing with death (which is something almost never talked in Pokémon) another one about family issues; and more recently, the episodes focusing on Lilly&#039;s trauma.<br />
<br />
As of episode 50, lots of things actually happened, and it was by far the most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263647">

    [Watching the subbed version.]<br />
<br />
So yeah, this is Pokemon...and the reason you love it? Mouse with red cheeks? Cute looking creatures? Well that is the reason why pretty much most people got attracted to Pokemon GO and now it&#039;s dying. But seriously, I am not going to weep over the art style like the entire Internet. This is a legit non-salty review so give it all the hate you want.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
Oh, there is a story? Despite removing the gyms and making something more complicated like trials? Well that is a pretty stupid reason. There is little to no plot in this entire thing except fillers and more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review245226">
        random and stupid little things that no one literally cares about. This is a very cheeky strategy, to make their viewers watch a hell load of stuff and then fill them with hype for an &quot;epic battle&quot;. (Since the very beginning, but atleast the old fillers were bearable and fun to watch) <br />
<br />
Art<br />
I have nothing to say since you people are smart enough to figure it out. Remember how people were crying on Facebook and telling everyone to boycott Pokemon? Yeah, you should get an idea.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Nothing to say here either. I guess the OP and ED is good for kids below 13 but there&#039;s literally nothing I can do if you like it because it is kiddish and all that. But trust me I am not judging anyone.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
Ash<br />
Completely dumped down to the very midst of nothingness. Well it was a stupid decision to send him to school and seeing his maturity get crushed is okay and all that but not at this level. Remember the &quot;fun&quot; we had watching Misty, May, Dawn and Iris fight with Ash? Yeah, it&#039;s nothing at that level.<br />
<br />
Mallow<br />
Interesting character, For the least I would say she&#039;s okay and she knows what she is doing. Most people think that she likes ash and all that stuff so they have started shipping. (That reminds me Amourshipping is dead.)<br />
<br />
Lillie<br />
My favorite character due to various reasons. I thought she was a tsundere but bad luck fell upon me with the release of the game. It wasn&#039;t what I expected. She&#039;s related to a major plot point so I would avoid any further discussion about her.<br />
<br />
Lana<br />
Seriously too cute. I would say the second reason why I keep watching S&amp;M but yeah, she&#039;s a kuudere I guess? Not sure what to say but she&#039;s the silent type. And she&#039;s flat..<br />
<br />
Kiawe<br />
The only character who has a serious attitude. He is cool and he knows the stuff he is doing so he was the first &quot;serious&quot; character I guess?<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
It has some funny moments but mostly the jokes are not that funny for an adult but it might be sufficient enough to make a kid laugh. (below 13)<br />
I seriously would have give the enjoyment a 1 rating but there were some parts that would appeal to the younger audience so I let it slide.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
Maybe they are trying to oblige the new fans by showing them something new but seriously they never think once about their older audience and we are just overlooked because we turned old. (Just an empty assumption) Well whatever the case may be Reverse Psychology can be a real pain.  <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for nostalgia then you should probably wait for the 20th Movie because the animations look promising somewhat but I wouldn&#039;t pre-hype if I were you. <br />
<br />
Please think twice before reporting my review. Not hate but my personal opinion.

    I remember being really upset when I first saw this. XY and XYZ were amazing and I was just so attached to it. Sun and Moon proved me wrong and showed something else I failed to see.<br />
<br />
The story is really good. I love how each episode is unique. Each episode shows the main focus of this anime: Alola. The region shines here and is just not  &quot;another&quot; setting. No, my friends. This anime puts the region up front. Alola and its culture were amazing in the games but here we get to see it even closer. Each episode shows a cool new facet of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271292">
        it and it&#039;s a real living and breathing region. Plus it&#039;s fun. That describes the anime. Fun. Each episode is so much fun and brought a smile to my face! It&#039;s amazing the way it does it. There are no filler episodes because each serves a purpose to show Alola. Then there are the arcs. One time they went to another island, Akala and wow. Wow. It was amazing, the story was amazing and the visuals were amazing. One beautiful evolution with the sunset. I won&#039;t spoil but I almost shed tears on how beautiful that scene was. This Pokemon anime. story-wise it holds up and has its amazing moment. Just don&#039;t expect deep stuff and see the fun in it. It&#039;s worth it. 8/10<br />
<br />
Now the characters, a major pillar of the show. I&#039;ll say right off the bat they deserve nothing less than a 10/10. Let me explain. Ash is as great as always, he&#039;s a bit more energetic and is very childish. It took a while to get used to, as he was the opposite in XY. I admit I miss the XY days of Ash but this ain&#039;t half bad. Actually not bad at all. I still enjoy Ash and he&#039;s the still the awesome protagonist. Then it&#039;s the supporting characters and they rule. Mallow is the more energetic and lovable person or Kiawe who&#039;s the more calm but powerful dude. Kukui is awesome. Straight up awesome dude. This show has the best supporting cast ever. Each is amazing in their own right. 10/10<br />
<br />
Sound <br />
Great music. The same ones you loved in the game are back and they give you the chills! Good stuff.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
This show surpassed my expectations. I really do love it and it&#039;s a nice chill anime that can lighten up even the saddest of days. It may not reach the heights of XY but in its own right, it&#039;s amazing. I love the setting and each episode is amazing. I cannot wait for the future of this series but for gen 8, let&#039;s go back to more serious things ok?

    As a &#039;90s kid, I have watched Pokemon since Episode 1 of season 1. I have seen almost all of the hundreds of episodes that have been released. Sometimes I loved it, sometimes I hated it.<br />
One thing about the Pokémon anime : we actually CAN&#039;T talk about it as a single show. Each &quot;cycle&quot; has its own art style, its own atmosphere, its own style of storytelling.<br />
Sometimes it&#039;s a hit, sometimes it&#039;s a miss. None of these shows are perfect but some of them are huge fails and some of them really are surprisingly good.<br />
What about Pokémon Sun&amp;Moon, then? I&#039;ll be blunt : imo, it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281542">
        is a HUGE fail in every way.<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
Satoshi decides to stay at the Pokémon School in Alola region because it seems fun. He meets some new friends, including Lillie who has a terribly sad background, which is unveiled across the first part of the anime.<br />
Just like the games, the story revolves around Lillie and her family, around the tragedies that they met in the past. That story is different from the game though.<br />
In the anime, Lillie got traumatized by a Pokemon when she was a kid and was never able to touch any of them again since then. After this, her brother Gladion left the house to train, while their mother runs her business, leaving her children aside.<br />
If that story is less tragic than the equivalent in the game, it is still really enjoyable to watch.<br />
Lillie&#039;s evolution is progressive and the mysteries around her story are good.<br />
So, what&#039;s wrong with the story of this show? Well, aside from Lillie and her family, the rest is empty. Almost each episode is a filler unrelated to the previous ones, and almost none of them actually bring something to the story or the characters.<br />
<br />
Also, as there is no Pokemon League and the Alola Tour is barely present, there is no actual story except for Lillie&#039;s past and the Ultra Beasts&#039; attacks. This is why most of the episodes are fillers : as long as they don&#039;t fit in any of those two stories, they are useless.<br />
<br />
Long story short, the story is good but the storytelling is terrible, because most of the episodes are pointless.<br />
<br />
<br />
ART<br />
I&#039;ll be honest, I&#039;m from those who hate the new chara-design. There is just no denying that it is many steps backwards compared to XY. It&#039;s way less detailed than before, way less neat than before (there are countless drawing mistakes, like deformed bodies, dirty frame transitions and ugly motion blur).<br />
The worst thing is, Pokemon kept getting better and better when it comes to art style. It came from very far (the original Pokemon series was ugly, even back then!), but it kept getting better, UNTIL Sun&amp;Moon. This show is the very first step backward that Pokémon took, regarding art style.<br />
<br />
That said, does it deserve all the hate it gets? I don&#039;t think so. Because it is still enjoyable to see, especially thanks to the light effects and the environments. But it is undeniably a flaw when compared to the previous shows.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
Pokemon has always been quite memorable when it comes to music. I love the openings, I don&#039;t really like the ending, and the OST is cool but not as memorable as before, imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
Except Lillie, all the other characters are barely developed and are pointless, at least for now. They&#039;re just here to fill in. Even Satoshi isn&#039;t very important to the story (which is hilarious, considering it&#039;s the MC).<br />
Most of those characters have very few episodes dedicated to them, and even those episodes don&#039;t teach us anything that really matter. Actually, the whole characters don&#039;t really matter as they don&#039;t have any story (thus, no progression towards any goal).<br />
Even Satoshi, who has ever had a goal, kind of stopped his progression. Some say it&#039;s because he is kind of on vacation... and I actually like that idea. In Pokémon SM, Satoshi takes a pause in his journey. It doesn&#039;t change the fact that he doesn&#039;t progress at all in this show though.<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
Personally, I really hate this show. After Pokemon XY which was serious and epic, we get one of the dumbest shows in japanimation EVER. There is a lot of brainless comedy, which is not even for kids : it&#039;s for babies, or retarded.<br />
No, I did NOT enjoy Satoshi jumping on an aquarium&#039;s glass. No, I did NOT enjoy the dozens of funny faces per episode. No, I did NOT enjoy &quot;Black Oak&quot; &#039;s Pokemon puns.<br />
That said, I really like the battles. The animation is not as good as before, but it is still quite good!<br />
<br />
Finally, there&#039;s the worst point: if the Pokemon anime has always been here to advertise the games, all the previous series didn&#039;t do ONLY that. Even BW, highly criticized, didn&#039;t do all its choices based on marketing.<br />
But Pokemon SM does. Almost EVERYTHING they do, it&#039;s for advertising. Want some examples? They bring back Brock and Misty in a few episodes. Story-wise, there&#039;s LITERALLY NO REASON. So why bring them back? Because the Let&#039;s Go games have been released.<br />
The same for everything: they keep throwing Z-moves in our face, like they&#039;re desperate to show what can be done in the SM games. For the sake of comparison: when they made Contests in the 3rd generation, the series version of the Contest barely had anything to do with the games version. Of course it introduced that new functionality, BUT the Contests in the series were their own thing. And they were developed. They weren&#039;t thrown to say &quot;look, you can do that in our games, please go buy them right noooow!&quot;. The Contests were creative and the story of May (and Dawn later on) were developed.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the Pokemon SM anime is JUST an obvious advertizing showcase. Something even BW was not.<br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL<br />
Many people consider Pokémon is &quot;for kids&quot; (meaning : &quot;not really clever&quot;). Well, it&#039;s not always the case. Some of those shows are deep enough to be enjoyed even by adults, namely Pokemon DP and Pokemon XY. Even Pokemon AG can be fun for older people.<br />
Why&#039;s that? Because Pokemon can be watched as a SPORTS ANIME. Pokémon Battles and Pokemon Contests are some sort of sports after all, with the competitions and the training sessions.<br />
<br />
But Pokemon SM is definitely, with no doubt, stupid as hell. There is no competition to follow like in the previous show, there is very few story to learn, and it is plain stupid most of the time.<br />
Pokémon is not supposed to be dumb. Hell, &quot;kids shows&quot; in general are not supposed to be dumb!

    I&#039;ve been going around in mental circles for a while, trying to figure out how I wanted to do this review... Because the thing is... This IS a good season. It was just-- by a wide margin-- not my favorite season. <br />
<br />
There were a lot of things it did well that just weren&#039;t for me. But I kind of knew that would be true as soon as I saw the trailers for it when it first came out all those years ago. Everyone kept telling me I would get used to the art style. I still hate it. It looks fine on all the new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343132">
        characters I haven&#039;t already seen drawn in a different style, but it looks awful on Ash and Team Rocket and all the old faces. And that may sound like a really insignificant, don&#039;t-judge-a-book-by-its-cover sort of complaint, but the art style can say a lot about a show. Especially when it&#039;s changing from season to season like Pokémon does. Sun and Moon&#039;s designs were a little goofier. In line with the season as a whole being a lot more lighthearted. And that&#039;s fine for a kids&#039; show, and it could be perfectly enjoyable at times... (I liked all the characters. In fact, as a whole, I think this season has the most likable cast of characters of any Pokémon season I&#039;ve watched. And the final episode was really heartfelt. Watching Kukui and Burnet hug him goodbye actually made me tear up a bit. Ash&#039;s mom has had some good moments over the years, but we&#039;ve never really gotten to see Ash have a real family dynamic with anyone, and that aspect of it here was really great.) But Pokémon really hit its current peak with XY&amp;Z for me. I loved that it got a little more serious. Anything toned down from that was going to be lesser in my eyes. Just a matter of preferences, I guess.<br />
<br />
Storywise, it was just weaker overall in my eyes. It really brought me back to the early seasons of Pokémon, where we went so long in between gym battles that it barely felt like there was a story at all. The island trial episodes were cool... but they really didn&#039;t feel like they held any significance over anything, especially because you didn&#039;t even end up needing ANY sort of qualifications to enter the region&#039;s first Pokémon League. <br />
The Ultra Guardians aspect of the story... watching  these kids form their own sort of pseudo-Power Rangers team was cool. (I love me a good magical girl-esque transformation sequence.) But suffered from the same problem. Everything just felt so disjointed here. The Ultra Beasts could show up on a whim... whenever the writers ran through enough of their other episode ideas, I guess. They posed enough of an actual threat to the region that I feel like the kids could have at least been looking for some way to keep the portal closed... I just really needed an overarching story for this season, and never quite found it. Like, once we got into the story with Lillie&#039;s family and amnesia in season one, things got really good for a while. Gave me hope. And then it all kind of just fell apart again. <br />
<br />
But ultimately... all the real complaints I have about this season... come down to me starting to believe that the writers and I must have very different opinions on what makes up the fundamentals of Ash as a character. Yes, he&#039;s easily excitable and has this unrivaled love for all things Pokémon... but I just can&#039;t see him ever being happy settling down in a place like Alola to go to school. Not even with great friends. Not even if the school offers new Pokémon-related experiences each class. It&#039;s just... not Ash. It felt too stagnant for him. I can&#039;t see the extremely spaced-out island trials scratching his competitive itch. At least when he&#039;s on the road, it feels like he&#039;s actively working towards the next challenge.<br />
<br />
I guess it&#039;s fitting but... This whole &#039;journey&#039; through Alola feels like a vacation for Ash. In general, it&#039;s just not the place for him. Everything&#039;s just a little TOO laid-back. As a whole, it didn&#039;t really feel like a region for a serious battler like Ash. And in general, it feels like the writers handicapped his battling skills a bit, especially as the series went on. Like, yes, Ash is known for being the guy who can get out of a tight spot with sheer willpower and crazy ideas...  but sometimes it feels like the writers forget that he IS capable of actual type-based strategizing too. <br />
<br />
There are a few exceptions throughout. Gladion and Kukui...(Hau could have been an example, but we barely see him.)  Kiawe takes it seriously, and Lana also had a competitive edge, though the series (unfortunately) never seemed to take her as seriously as Ash and Kiawe. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any better example than the few episodes where the class visits Kanto and Ash gets to really shine-- back in his element-- sparring with the gym leaders of old... while it quickly became clear that his new friends had really only understood battling in theory up to this point. Hell, Mallow doesn&#039;t have her moment where she realizes she shouldn&#039;t ever just give up mid-battle until the MIDDLE OF HER POKEMON LEAGUE MATCH... That whole League was a joke and actually really annoyed me, but... Deep breaths. <br />
<br />
Anyway. Sun and Moon was fun and cute and lighthearted and I DID enjoy a lot of it. I mean, Rowlet&#039;s the most adorable thing this franchise has ever created, so I have to give it points for that. It&#039;s just... not what I want Pokémon to be. We got to see it at its best in Kalos, and a story like this one just couldn&#039;t live up to my expectations after that. I know practically nothing about the next region... (I&#039;ve literally only seen the starters and this sheep Pokémon and that&#039;s it.) But I&#039;m hoping it picks back up again with the next season, and we get to see more of Ash as he was meant to be.
