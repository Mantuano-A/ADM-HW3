    In the midst of all of the decent shows that have come out this season, a peculiar one has piqued my interest. This is of course a very special show, often described as being &quot;intentionally unintentionally funny&quot; by the people who know fuckall about what they are talking about. So why is this show so intentionally unintentionally funny? It isn&#039;t. Mayoiga is a show that had some of the worst writing I&#039;ve ever seen and it seems to have picked up on that fact, albeit a little bit too late. What people seem to be missing is that when a show makes itself looks ridiculous

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220975">
        and ends up being a mess, its&#039; genres do not change by default as well. &quot;Erased was never a mystery hurr durr&quot;. Enter: Teenage Angst, the series.<br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t actually that bad on paper. It&#039;s cliché as hell but doesn&#039;t seem like something that can ruin a series all on its own. The most important factor here is the execution and you can probably guess that it&#039;s not so great. Mayoiga is a story about 30 social misfits and takes place in Nanakimura village, a village rumored to be a safe haven from society, where people who want  to escape from reality go to. So being the bright little crew they are, our cast makes an ingenious idea to organize a bus tour in order to leave their previous lives behind and start anew!<br />
<br />
First and foremost, who thought it would be a good idea to have a cast of 30 characters within a 12 episode anime? That is literally spelling out disaster, no matter the execution. Short series usually have trouble with fleshing out the handful of people that make the main cast, but Mayoiga decided to take it to an entire new level like it was no big deal. You can only imagine how much the story as well as the characters suffer from this. 90% of them don&#039;t even get a backstory, and those who do get a 5 minute exaggeration of something terrible that happened in their lives.<br />
<br />
With the premise and setting giving out so many horror vibes, as well as it having the same production crew that worked on Another, I had obviously jumped to the conclusion that this is a horror series. At least that&#039;s an efficient way to cut down a considerable portion of the cast, right? To my great disappointment, I was completely wrong. There is a single &quot;death&quot; to start the show off but other than that, it fails to deliver. I was at least going in with expectations that it&#039;ll be a fun and stupid ride like Another was, but ended up being thoroughly disappointed.<br />
<br />
Being a good psychological series is practically impossible when every single character in your cast is borderline insane and / or delusional with very few exceptions. None of them act like normal human beings to begin with and their stories are exaggerated in the worst ways possible, trying as hard as they can to victimize them and justify their insane mindset, which is frankly impossible. The mystery is nonsensical and completely relies on the supernatural, which is a flaw in itself.<br />
<br />
The lowest of the low. This is easily some of the worst characterization that I have seen in my entire life. Not only are over half of the characters completely useless, but they also lack any sort of rationality and common sense to add onto it. They are as deep as a puddle to put it lightly. Needless to say, there is absolutely 0 chemistry between any of them and the drama feels so incredibly forced, as they are shown to argue over the most trivial of things imaginable. Like in one of the highlights of the show where a character randomly decides to want to STAB another character because he didn&#039;t like his name. Just your everyday stuff.<br />
<br />
Our protagonist is the spinning image of a goody two shoes, as he wants to help everyone and everything around him. I&#039;m not sure how he managed to maintain this overly-positive outlook on life but it makes him one of the most annoying protagonists in the entire medium and somewhere along the way you end up wanting him to die a horrible death. Not to mention how oblivious he is to virtually everything around him, which sometimes really made me question how he has retained being a functioning member of society for the past 17 years.<br />
<br />
Masaki: I need to go to the bathroom<br />
Mitsumune: Do you want me to go with you?<br />
<br />
No one else is really worth mentioning, although I do briefly want to touch upon something that impressed me. This series managed to make the most stereotypical fat guy that I have ever seen in my life. I&#039;m not even exaggerating, all he does during the entirety of the series is either eat potato chips, tell us that he&#039;s tired or he just falls asleep and that is all there is to his character. Hats off to you, Mayoiga. We have truly hit rock bottom with this one.<br />
<br />
The art is very subpar and lacking in a lot of instances. It is bland in the worst way possible which you can probably gather by looking at Mitsumune&#039;s face for a solid 3 seconds or so. If I had to compare the style to something, it would definitely be to Another. The only difference being in the fact that Another had very saturated backgrounds and visuals to help enhance the theme and atmosphere of the show, while Mayoiga doesn&#039;t really have anything. As for the animation, it definitely reaches its peak about halfway through when they start showing us these giant CGI monsters. My personal favorite was the one-eyed furby penguin. <br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t something I have ever payed much thought nor attention to before, but I feel like it needs to be addressed for this specific case. The utilization of the sound effects is legitimately some of the worst that I have ever witnessed in any sort of media. In particular, there is this sound effect that sounds like bones breaking and it is used way too often for things it shouldn&#039;t be. The opening is your typical J-pop kyaa uguu song and the ending isn&#039;t spectacular either. Mitsumune&#039;s seiyuu made me want to slit my throat multiple times during the duration of the series so I can at least vouch that it made an impression. OST is forgettable and misplaced in most instances, which makes me take it even less seriously than before, if that&#039;s even possible. Warui hippopotamusuuu, rururu ruru ru.<br />
<br />
To quote a good friend, &quot;It will be performed as an opera on the holodecks of the ships that disperse us into the highest of heavens. It all began... here. In this place, in this time, NOW. We were really all just clothed monkeys until Mayoiga allowed us to transcend our animalism. I shall sing its praises to all that shall come forth and be enlightened.&quot; With all of that being said, from a critical standpoint Mayoiga is just a complete and utter turd, give or take. It starts off as a bad series and devolves into something so horrid that not even the worst of plebs would dare poke with a 5-meter stick. So with your health in mind, even if you have some kind of morbid curiosity or are just an extreme masochist, this title should be proceeded with the utmost caution.

    Yes, I apologize, but I&#039;m going to have to join the Mayoiga debate, since there are apparently a large number of individuals in the anime community who are convinced that this beautiful disaster is somehow entirely unaware of the fact that it&#039;s a comedy. Now, I&#039;ve heard a lot of things said about the matter, and so I would firstly like to clarify that I am not a diehard fan of the show trying to justify it, nor am I attempting to tell anyone that they are somehow stupid or foolish for assuming that Mayoiga is actually just mind-numbingly stupid trash. I don&#039;t even consider

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223738">
        this some enlightened or critical interpretation: this review&#039;s main purpose is to tell people that yes, this show is worth watching, and that yes, it is only worth watching if you look at it from the standpoint of &quot;Mizushima and Okada have fun messing around with B horror tropes&quot;, because while there are certainly a fair number of blatant giveaways, much of Mayoiga&#039;s humor comes from the small details.<br />
<br />
So why is Mayoiga good again?<br />
<br />
Most anime comedies are bad. That&#039;s an opinion, obviously, but it&#039;s one that I&#039;m fairly hard-set on. Anime comedy derives mostly from physical comedy, overreactions, making fun of anime tropes, stupid sex jokes/boob jokes/food jokes, and other versions of uncreative/broad-appeal humor that gets reused over and over. When anime does set up good jokes, it often ruins them by pointing to them aggressively to make sure you understood the fact that yes, this was in fact supposed to be humor.<br />
<br />
Mayoiga never does this. Once. What makes the show work more than anything is that it&#039;s so absurdly self serious one-hundred percent of the time. More than anything, this is likely why there is so much debate surrounding it, because there is never a single moment in the show where Mayoiga acknowledges that anything that it&#039;s doing is a joke. On the other hand though, this is what makes it so entertaining. You have stuff like Nyanta and Jigoku wandering around with amunition belts and assault rifles or Lovepon ceaselessly screaming about her gradually-escalating need to execute someone, and no one pays this even a lick of attention. It&#039;s pretty much the anime equivalent of that comic with the dog in the middle of an inferno saying &quot;this is fine.&quot; In Mayoiga, nonsense passes as logic and no one questions it once. The names &quot;Hyouketsu no Judgeness&quot; and &quot;Jack&quot; are acknowledged to be &#039;similar&#039;. A character claiming to be able to see dead people is accepted as a valid argument as to why another character is not in fact a ghost. Medieval forms of witch torture are used as practical assessments of guilt, with a council of thoughtful glasses-pushing intellectuals actually trying to stab a twelve-year-old girl just to check if she&#039;ll bleed or not. The offhand way in which Mayoiga spews utter nonsense without ever treating its story and world as anything other than absolutely intense and important makes what would be an absolutely attrocious plot into a phenomenal piece of entertainment. <br />
<br />
But it goes past that. Mayoiga&#039;s dialogue and overblown character tropes may be fun, but what really makes the show special is that it assumes that the audience has seen at least a few B horror movies and murder-mystery plots in their day, and it uses that to violently thrash their expectations in the most viscerally unsatisfying ways imaginable. If Mayoiga was a violent gorefest it would quickly slip into the realm of incoherence, lose the appeal of its nonsense dialogue, and turn into another Another (heh). But instead, Mayoiga capitalizes on lethargy and apathy. It treats its plot twists and reveals like inqonsequential details to skim over. Instead of whipping its characters up into a frenzy, it makes the majority of them lazy, subdued, whiny, and complacent. It devotes ominous attention to cast member that are never remotely relevant. If ever there were a perfect backdrop against which to place a few under-the-radar psychos and sociopaths, it&#039;s the one that Mayoiga creates through its easily-distracted mob. When characters start going missing, large portions of the cast are more concerned with existential reasoning or even debating the spelling of said character&#039;s names than with worrying about their own or their comrade&#039;s safety. Beyond this, Mayoiga goes so far as to present some of the worst direction concievably possible, pace itself in ways that make no sense, and demonstrate a staggering penchant for anticlimax right through to the very end. It could be argued that the plot was technically &#039;resolved&#039;, because it was, but it is done is such a way that you&#039;re left confused and slightly baffled, wondering &#039;wait, what? that&#039;s it? this is a story, weren&#039;t there supposed to be dramatic stakes?&#039; and then you can&#039;t help but chuckle at the fact that Mayoiga got you good one last time as you realize that it couldn&#039;t have been any other way.<br />
<br />
So yeah, Mayoiga is hilarious. I laughed out loud at least two or three times an episode on average, with plenty of chuckles in between, and I&#039;m talking about from the very first episode. This is funny stuff. <br />
<br />
That said, even for what it is, it&#039;s by no means perfect. I enjoyed the show immensely, but I still wish that it had been just a little bit better at what it does. The final third of the show is noticeably less funny than the rest, with a reliance on anticlimax and executing big moments horribly taking away from some of the show&#039;s momentum. In addition, the show is composed by Okada, who has always loved her melodrama, and this becomes more and more apparent as the number of faux-emotional flashbacks intensifies until that joke has been overdone and it loses its charm. If these flashbacks and idiotic backstories had become increasingly more absurd and creative perhaps this would have worked better, but the show&#039;s best backstories are mostly the early ones so unforunately this wasn&#039;t the case. In addition, it&#039;s usually the case the truly successful comedies succeed the way they do because they manage to be engaging even when they aren&#039;t throwing out jokes simply through atmosphere/intesity/actual plot, and again unfortunately when Mayoiga isn&#039;t making you laugh, it isn&#039;t really doing anything of note. In my opinion, this is what sets something like the first season of Jojo apart from the rest of the fold--even Mayoiga--in that even when Jojo isn&#039;t being immediately absurd, it manages to breed an atmosphere of fun and excitement that keeps you interested because it feels like an adventure and not just one big joke. So yeah, this thing is flawed. But that doesn&#039;t change the fact that it&#039;s a great time, and that it&#039;s consistent enough to not give you that empty feeling of &#039;I want to laugh more, I&#039;m in a humorous mood, but the show&#039;s just not quite getting there&quot;. With the right attitude, Mayoiga delivers.<br />
<br />
In the end it kinda just makes me sad to see the show getting so much hate, because it&#039;s a kind of unique and truly dedicated comedy that we see rarely-to-never in anime, and it would be cool if more people could appreciate it. After watching people explode over stuff like Konosuba (personally, I find Konosuba to be, well, kinda garbage, but to each his own) I was excited to have an airing comedy that I was also invested in and could laugh along with the rest of the community. At this point, it seems a little late for that, but it&#039;s not to late for all you smart people out there who spend your time wisely and wait until the end of the season to see reviews and decide what looks like it&#039;s worth watching. Despite what almost everyone is saying to the contrary, I firmly believe that if you go into Mayoiga expecting a comedy and a self-aware but deadpan parody that you will likely find yourself happily laughing for twelve delightful episodes. Every type of humor isn&#039;t for everyone, granted, but for what it does Mayoiga is pretty much one-of-a-kind among anime, and I think it&#039;s worth giving a shot, even if just to see if it&#039;s for you.<br />
<br />
In Mayoiga-esque fashion, here&#039;s the score breakdown loaded ino the end of the review now that it&#039;s almost entirely irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Story-- Decidedly unique. Better than Trasformers: Dark of the Moon. No other information necessary.<br />
<br />
Art-- Totally fucking terrible, the CGI looks like a bad skyrim mod.<br />
<br />
Sound-- Surprisingly competent, could even be counted against the show because it&#039;s too effective. Opening is catchy AF.<br />
<br />
Character-- You either love them or you Lovepon them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-- Really the only thing worth mentioning, it&#039;s a good time, that&#039;s enough of that.<br />
<br />
Fin.<br />
<br />
Hail Lovepon.

    Watching Mayoiga is like opening a surprise package and finding out it&#039;s something you so fiercely hate, thus transitioning your expectations into a decaying death. The premise itself is interesting, and there&#039;s a sense of an odd feeling of triumph at the beginning because as rarely as it comes, to see a pure original &#039;lost somewhere&#039; flick is definitely something you can look forward to with excessive hype and such was the case with myself. As a matter of fact, before the spring season began, I had Mayoiga at the top of my most anticipated shows list. But Mayoiga, or rather Trainwre- I mean... The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221009">
        Lost Village, turns out as a complete disaster. <br />
<br />
Mayoiga begins with a bunch of ragtags together inside a bus heading towards a peculiar place known only as the Nanaki Village. The similarity between all the people, thirty to be precise, is that each and every one of them had a traumatic past of which they were all desperate to escape from. Nanaki Village is a place that is not on the map and no one knows about it, and no one can pin-point the location of the place. Nanaki Village doesn&#039;t exist. That is until a mysterious group known as &quot;It&#039;s Super Genesis&quot; or &quot;ISG&quot; for short discovers the exact location of Nanaki Village.  Various online users who make it through layers of protection of the ISG website, take part in this tour which is branded as the &quot;Start Life Over&quot; tour where people are seeking a world free of hassle and trying to relive their lives, escaping the reality. The irony in the story lies in the fact that &quot;changing your lives&quot; is something the adults should be doing, not a group of teenagers who have barely lived.<br />
 <br />
A whopping thirty characters could all be in theory, regarded as our protagonists. But we all know that&#039;s not bound to happen in a show which consists of just twelve episodes. And that brings us to Mitsumune, the main character in which the show mostly revolves around and has the spotlight. For one, there is nothing that separates Mitsumune from the other thousands of generic main guys there are. He is shy, pathetic and single-minded who has a positive outlook no matter what happens. He is also very disloyal, so much so that he gives up on his best friend, who also joins him on the tour by the way, for a girl he met in the tour! Looking at Mitsumune makes you wonder why would such a phony guy even join on this tour? There&#039;s a backstory to him which is just as miserly as the show itself. As I said before, the first episode starts off with the tour organizer, Dahara, stating that only the people with gifted talent could ever break through the layers of their website and join the tour, which also makes you think as to how someone as dense as Mitsumune could have done that all by himself? Mayoiga is full of contradictions such as this. <br />
<br />
The rest of the characters are up to no good as well. A majority of them merely exist for plot conveniences, and that includes Mitsumune at times too, and have little to no in-depth characterization. Probably a few of them worth mentioning are Masaki, the mysterious girl to whom Mitsumune falls for. She plays a big role as the show progresses, but there are little traits to her character worth explaining. She&#039;s basically used as the embodiment of the emotional trope and is a pretty one-dimensional character. Hayato who goes by the pseudonym Speedstar, is a good friend of Mitsumune&#039;s. He acts as the support for Mitsumune and helps him out whenever he is in need. Speedstar is more suited to be the show&#039;s protagonist in my opinion as he&#039;s displayed as someone who has a strong willpower and personality. He undergoes a terrible characterization later on however which was a waste. A few characters act as a sidekick like Valkana, who is shown as a very angry man. Koharun, who is the one responsible for locating the Nanaki Village and Lovepon, who is probably the craziest in my opinion. All she ever talks is about executing and is a good example of a literal cardboard-cut &quot;yandere&quot; trope character. However, there&#039;s a backstory on her which was quite captivating and displayed the struggles she goes through as a kid. It&#039;s depressing since the show doesn&#039;t do justice at all to the backstory as she&#039;s used for mere conveniences by taking on a more active role in the coming episodes saying the exact same thing over and over again. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s such a shame because Mayoiga has well-designed characters for an original show. The art isn&#039;t anything significant and is nothing but generic, but it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean bad. The characters and the backgrounds are drawn simple and not too exaggerated which helps the viewers settle in very quickly. But for the most part, there is a visible decline in the art and a good example of this are the first two episodes. The pilot episode has nice visuals but there are times when it goes downhill from there in the coming episodes. The CGI effects used later on suck for the most part. One of the main reasons being the totally absurd &quot;Monsters&quot; but yet there are moments where the characters are shown alongside the CGI-designed creatures and it all feels very underwhelming. The visuals for the opening/ending songs respectively are kept very minimal where they focus on merely introducing the characters. The ending especially only uses the faces of the characters in them with different characters in the next episode ending than the previous. Overall I have to say the art is pretty mediocre. <br />
<br />
The sound aspect of Mayoiga is once again a mixed bag. On one hand: Fantastic opening and ending song, A few good soundtracks in between which play by the mood and the atmosphere etc. And then there is this task of voicing over two dozens of characters. Honestly, many of the characters&#039; voices are done terribly and seemingly by amateurs in the industry. And it comes as no surprise for an anime which was supported by crowdfunding, to have budget issues and made by a small time studio. Many of the characters are played by the newer personnel or ones with little experience in voice acting and that is so very evident in Mayoiga. <br />
<br />
Mayoiga is at times so insane that it matches the contemporaries of those anime which are so bad that they&#039;re good. It&#039;s a common expectation that with such a huge amount of cast, many will be put off to death soon and that does seem to be happening until it takes a completely different route. It&#039;s tough to tell after a few episodes if this is truly a mystery show, psychological drama or a satirical comedy. Mayoiga doesn&#039;t rely on gore to put off the viewers and be &#039;edgy&#039;. But instead it uses hysterically pretentious philosophical dialogues and awful plot twists which literally does the trick and puts off everyone watching it and can be deemed as cringe-worthy. At this point I&#039;m just gonna say avoid Mayoiga at all costs. It&#039;s an utter waste of time and nothing good will ever come out watching it. I&#039;d also like to mention that this is the worst anime I&#039;ve ever seen.<br />

    Mayoiga (The Lost Village) is a really strange series and to watch it, you’ll really need to do it with some attention or an open mind. I can’t remember the last time I watched a show with such amount of absurdity, to a point where I feel just as lost as the characters in the story. Directed by Tsutomu Mizushima (Shirobako, Girls und Panzer), the series takes the genre of mystery but what you expect isn’t what you’ll likely get. And in many ways, Mayoiga sends a wrong message that makes the show look like a borderline comedy.<br />
<br />
As an original series, the premise itself sounds

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220937">
        interesting. Think about it. You have a group of characters each with their own personalities but all end up in the same place, a village named Nanakimura. It invites a lot of questions about what takes place and the discoveries they’ll make. Those who have seen series such as Another, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, and Ghost Hound may be in for a treat. On paper, the show looks intriguing. However, the first episode gave me a mixed impression especially when it introduces 30 characters. What goes on my mind is: how on Earth do they plan to give characterization with this many people? The show is also only 1 cour so my expectations was rather dense about how much they can focus on the story as well.<br />
<br />
Essentially, the show is pretty much about a group of characters being lost in a remote location after being dropped off by the bus driver. The setting (Lost Village) invites a lot of attention because by plot formulaic standards, there’s bound for a lot to happen. It’s not strange in the sense that everyone on this trip gets lost but why they are there. And it also sets up developments related to survival, trust issues, and possibly even death. The show already establishes a few given ideas though – being that no one really knows why they’re there, what’s at the village, or how to get back. There’s a lot of diverse personalities all mixed in at once if we take at the characters individually. Their common goal of course is to get the hell away from there as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
On paper, there’s 30 characters but the series does manage to show some background stories for some of the more prominent individuals. Besides Mitsumune, we also get some storytelling about Hayato (Mitsumune’s best friend), Valkana (a man that is trying to build a new life from his previous job), Lovepon (a girl obsessed with execution), Nyanta (a kid with fondness with guns), the mysterious Masaki with connections with the bus driver, and among others. While their background stories doesn’t have direct connections to the main story, it does identify their characteristics. And that’s an important part of the show. The characters in this series needs to know who each other are to build trust. In a place of unknown, the last thing they need is betrayal or turmoil between each other. The show only does a moderate job at crafting relationships because quite honestly, there’s just too many characters to work around with. In retrospect, most of the character relationships are based more on how much they want to know about each other.<br />
<br />
After seeing a fair amount of episodes, I find it hard to understand the purpose of the show. Yes, it’s supposed to be a thriller but a lot of times, I find it rather amusing with the amount of superstitious events that occurs in the series. Perhaps it’s surreal comedy? Who knows but some of events going on are rather unbelievable. In addition, the story feels more like a skit where the characters are there for entertainment. Their established personalities become more and more evident as each episodes ventures on. At some point, I have to wonder if it series is trying to be unintentionally funny or not. For instance, the show at one point decided to actually make Lovepon into a prominent character for the viewers to take seriously despite her behavior being borderline insane. It’s definitely not scary if that’s the original purpose because just how ridiculous it has been. The first two episodes actually makes the series somewhat compelling because of the way it sets everything up. However, the amount of absurdity that builds up more and more and later feels just like popcorn comedy.<br />
<br />
While the artwork isn’t great, it isn’t bad either. It’s more like somewhere between the middle where it’s acceptable. The setting does have a genuine feeling of horror with its eerie atmosphere. Character designs aren’t impressive but they are fresh enough to show that each individual has some unique trait. The fun part about the show is the character expressions as we see how they react to certain situations. Lovepon is the gold standard for this while there are times when see others behave in ways that are laughable.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack on most part works for the show. It works in the way that it portrays the atmospheric setting well. The OP and ED theme songs aren’t very impressive but the OST has the general idea of giving mystery vibes. Character voice mannerism actually deserves some praise especially with the female characters because of how they react. Meanwhile, the show also crafts some dramatic scenery accompanied by the choreography of intense music at times. <br />
<br />
“What did I just watch?” You’ll probably ask yourself that question more times than you can count by the time this show is over. Make no mistake, Mayoiga is more about entertainment than an intriguing mystery or horror story. It has the general premise but it hardly delivers at what it tries to do. There’s also a lack of sorrow felt during the show despite some key staff involved and writing. So what is Mayoiga really? Is it a show that is “so bad, it’s good”? Well to me, it’s more of a “I’m so lost”.<br />

    It was like watching a train wreck, so bad, however so appealing to watch that you can&#039;t look away.<br />
<br />
Escapism is a major part of the story. Each of the 30 characters want to start their lives over again because of a troubling past. Now don&#039;t get me wrong, Mayoiga had, has a very interesting concept, plot, and story however I felt like it wasn&#039;t able to execute (get the pun) important things like dramatic scenes and capturing realistic emotions very well. The story and plot felt a bit too cliche, predictable, and badly written to the point where I don&#039;t even want to go back

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220926">
        and re-watch it. The plot for each episode undoubtedly displayed more faults than corrections. Now ordinarily when I&#039;m watching a show, it doesn&#039;t have to be too good nor too bad. As long as a show is unique, promising, and delivers great things then I&#039;m okay with it. Unfortunately this was just not the case with The lost village. An entire episode of Mayoiga can be slow and very unbalanced in terms of what elements to the story are being used. So at the beginning of an episode I&#039;ll notice that drama will start, then some sort of action, later horror, then back to drama, the direction certain episodes would go in were just too complex. The so called “horror” is unfortunately not Mayoiga&#039;s strength. If anything dramatic and bizarre conclusions to an episode would be.<br />
Some episodes you expect to see certain issues &amp; concerns resolved however they are not looked into further. Yeah, they&#039;ll show a character who drowned and another who fell off a mountain or cliff however none of that is explained any further. The other characters quickly forget about those people who appeared to have met some sort of grim fate. I understand that there was an attempt made to keep a mystery flow to the lost village however for the most Part I didn&#039;t feel like it was working out properly. <br />
<br />
How the producers tried to go about it made it look &amp; feel unnatural, as if they were trying a bit too hard... well maybe not with the setting. I&#039;ll admit fog and the woods does make for an overused, yet satisfy place for events like these to occur. With regard to the characters back stories, I really disliked how long it took for me to get a proper introduction to each of their traumatic pasts. I felt like if back-stories were introduced during the earlier episodes and not midway maybe I could establish some sort of personal connection and really get to like the characters, I&#039;ll explain further down below. Out of the very few things that I did admire about the show was that every time an episode was ending it would always end with something completely insane or bizarre that would get me excited to watch the next episode.<br />
In fact, the #1 reason why I continued to go on with this show is because of that! I love the build up! I would say that it is in fact very intense. So intense that I would just be questions to myself and with others what could we see happen on the next episode. Dialogue was another issue I had however I think I&#039;ll discuss more about this a bit later. I thought the story was alright, not the best, however it was still tolerable and decent enough to be engaging. <br />
<br />
My biggest disappointment with the show had to be the cast of characters. In my opinion, all the characters were too plain. Their back stories, personalities, actions, I just could not establish a connection to any of the characters and that really made tension and other moments pleasurable to me. I&#039;m not going to get exciting when some homosexual shooting arrows at people arrives. I&#039;m not going to freak out when every character thinks that the adorable Masaki is a ghost. 30 characters, Thirty! Each with different personalities and trauma, after the show was finished I had no favorites, no characters that I really liked, none that I could really understand it was such an unpleasant experience seeing the characters interact. A majority of the time it was like watching a bunch of clueless children. I honestly, and for the first time in quite a long time and I mean almost 2 years times, I&#039;ve watched a show where I didn&#039;t like any of the characters. Moving on, I felt like a majority of the characters were effortlessly written. By that I mean it was as if the team working on each episode didn&#039;t take their time to give most characters interesting characteristics. It was like all the group did was put a bunch of index cards with personalities written in a bag, shook it, pulled one out and said “Okay, we have drawn crazy” lets add a crazy personality to Love-pon, that&#039;s all. Each character acts according to certain archetype like dandere for Lion, or Nanko, nadeshiko for Masaki, genki for Nyanta etc. Characters did have the potential to be greater however. From what I saw, their actions, interactions, developments, I was not too impressed. I do not think it is possible for me to come back to this show just to see certain characters or relive special moments.<br />
<br />
Animation was really good. The special effects used to represent some characters fears or traumatizing life experiences looked both hilarious and amazing to a certain degree. I did notice that there were some animation problems, in particular I mean the moment in one episode where there are two Koharun&#039;s visible. Character designs were certainly interesting too. I admired the fact that no two characters looked alike. The animators made great use of CGI and 3D for silicone boob monster and other various things (I actually couldn&#039;t tell because that sort of animation was used during night settings.) Background settings looked pretty nice. I mentioned earlier that the main setting, fog, woods, mountains, etc(although cliche) works well with the stories plot because what better place to get away from all your troubles and start over again than an abandoned village out in the middle of boonies.<br />
<br />
For the most part I liked the soundtrack. The background music, the dramatic music worked pretty well when something strange, dramatic, or supernatural was occurring. The sound sort of helped add fear to the already hilarious joke of a “horror” show however, as stated earlier, they tried too hard. Music was quickly drowned out by the exaggerated screams and yells of characters in fear. Rule opening &amp; ED songs were pretty great! I had no issues with Em&#039; Sound effects held up pretty well, and everything else in general was good.<br />
<br />
<br />
At times however the biggest enjoyment comes from the well executed (PUNS PUNS PUNS!!!) plot twist/bizarre endings of each episode. In all honesty, that was the biggest reason I had to finish this show. The directors knew, they knew that they were going to have a difficult time keeping things interesting for fans, so they purposely added the bizarre endings and twist just to keep fans like me coming back every week, Clever bastards. That aside, I don&#039;t really don&#039;t think this was Mari Okada best work compared to other projects she&#039;s worked on.<br />
<br />
Overall Mayoiga has its issues and it just didn&#039;t have the lasting appealing for me. I won&#039;t think to myself a year later “Hmmm what was the name of that show where a bunch of people go on a crazy start life all over again trip?”

    The Lost Village is a rather unique show. Featuring a large cast of thirty named characters, acclaimed director Tsumotu Mizushima (Shirobako, Girls und Panzer, Dai Mahou Touge) and a similarly acclaimed writer Mari Okada (Ano Hana, Toradora, Nagi no Asakura); to call The Lost Village ambitious would be an understatement. In this review I intend to explain what makes The Lost Village brilliant whilst also explaining what makes this show as polarizing as it appears to be.<br />
<br />
The Lost Village presents itself as a horror show. A bunch of kids and young adults board a bus to a mysterious village in order to rebuild their lives.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221086">
        On the way large there are constant references to suicide, cannibalism, and torture. An incredibly generic thriller horror opening. Typically this kind of show with a large initial cast fall into that brand of horror where most of the cast is &#039;spent&#039; in either a gorey or a psychologically unnerving manner. That would normally be what draws people to the show initially, for example Higurashi. At the start of the season that is very much what I expected from The Lost Village: an over the top horror show with some incredibly silly deaths, basically Another. I couldn&#039;t have been more wrong.<br />
<br />
The Lost Village is a comedy show. It is a comedy show set in an amateur studentish horror show. Most anime comedy revolves around overt gags. You have a show, be it a comedy show or merely a show that utilizes a comedy, and in it a joke is presented to you. The joke is then commented on by the cast, usually a &#039;straight-man character&#039;. Obviously this varies, from Key adaptation&#039;s very single skit focussed approaches to comedy, to Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure&#039;s approach of having ridiculous things be ridiculous but playing it entirely straight within the show itself. However, none of these is how The Lost Village approaches comedy. The humour in The Lost Village is instead more meta-structural. Playing with genre or anime-in-general expectations by &#039;looking&#039; at the &#039;correct way&#039; of doing things and then doing the opposite. <br />
<br />
All thirty-something characters are all one dimensional flat characters with maybe one or two traits to each of them. You have the meowing gun fan, the earnest execution lover, that incredibly thirsty boy, and that&#039;s a joke. In a lesser show this would be atrocious. An entire cast of unlikable bland characters.  Yet the show constantly draws attention to not only how ridiculous the cast is, but also how genuine the cast is. That meowing gun lover will always be meowing, always will be in love with guns, and that is just their character. No tragic backstory, even when brought up, will explain that away like a traditional horror thriller would. The meowing gun fan isn&#039;t meowing because she was bullied as a kid, nor is the execution lover into execution as some form of vengeance over abuse.  Instead, The Lost Village&#039;s tragic backstories exist merely to poke fun at tragic backstories. To poke fun at itself, and to bring genuine laughter to it&#039;s audience.<br />
<br />
Almost everything in the show revolves around taking it&#039;s horror thrilling premise and ruining it. Any tense moment will be butchered by traditionally bad shot composition. All movement in a scene being off camera, the focus of a scene being completely absent and the 180 degree rule being ignored, or just putting props in the way of the character talking for the sheer purpose of taking all tension that &#039;should&#039; be in the scene away. Or perhaps, instead of using bad shot composition, what will ruin a scene is the cast just getting bored. Rather than grouping together, or splitting up in order to find the plot the vast majority of the time the cast state that they should be doing that and then immediately get bored and distracted. The show is completely consistent in it&#039;s contrivances. It&#039;s running jokes continue running and even reach climactic highs as the cast accidentally run across and have Plot happen to them.<br />
<br />
The Plot in The Lost Village is a Plot of nothingness. Since it takes so long for the cast to actually &#039;get&#039; anywhere what could typically have been a hamfisted appreciation of trauma instead takes an entire season to get going and then get&#039;s &#039;resolved&#039; in bored characters speaking verbal shitposts at each other. These conversations about nothing, or about something important before getting distracted account for around half of all that happens in the show. It&#039;s ridiculous. <br />
<br />
Yet, even with all this ridiculous nothingness going on, The Lost Village has some genuine moments. These genuine moments, whilst laughed at in some form of another most, but not all, of the time, are well done. A character dealing with or coming to terms with their trauma is not laughed at. The traumas that the Plot of the show explores are not the jokes in and of themselves. The Lost Village cares deeply for it&#039;s cast of sometimes absurd archetypes, and sometimes oddly genuine people. In caring for them it cares deeply for it&#039;s audience. Genuine struggles are treated genuinely. There&#039;s no gratuitous abuse, and the only violence that&#039;s a joke in and of itself tends to revolve around The Big Bads being CG and terrible.<br />
<br />
It would be easy to look at what The Lost Village does and compare it to check lists of good and bad writing and decide it is definitely of the former. But to consider the show bad because of this would be doing it a disservice. The Lost Village takes traditionally bad writing and direction and instead makes it good. The Lost Village uses the implicit &#039;joke&#039; in stuff like The Room or Birdemic and makes it explicit. If you buy into the inconsistent consistency of it&#039;s premise The Lost Village is a precious show. An unmissable and unique experience. However, such an experience may be hard to get into, for by using traditionally bad techniques can be a major turn off making it impossible for one to get immersed in the fun.

    Welcome to &quot;so bad it&#039;s actually funny&quot; – the anime. Sort of.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s hard to explain just how bad Mayoiga actually is without seeing it with your own eyes, but if I were to use one word to describe it then it&#039;d be &quot;amateurish&quot;. It feels like both the scriptwriting and the directing were done by a group of 14-year-olds for some school film project or something. It&#039;s like one of those second-rate western horror flicks that you solely watch for shits and giggles, except put in an anime format for even greater effect. You might be familiar with the 2012 anime &quot;Another&quot;: it was an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221017">
        anime which was supposed to be a horror/mystery show yet it became more known for being an unintentional comedy due to how hilariously bad it was at creating suspense and because of how stupid its death scenes were. Guess what; Mayoiga and Another share the same director... and as a result Mayoiga is basically the same deal all over again, though with a lot less casualties in it this time. Actually that&#039;s not entirely fair; Mayoiga is even worse.<br />
<br />
Within the first 5 minutes of the very first episode, we&#039;re introduced to *30* new characters, all with their own self-introductions. I have seriously never seen an anime before which overwhelms you to such an extent right from the start with so many new names to learn. How is anyone supposed to remember them all? Long story short, you won&#039;t. Don&#039;t even try. And besides, as you&#039;ll find out, the characters are all terrible anyway so spare yourself the effort.<br />
<br />
Basically, the story starts out with a bus filled with 30 unfamiliar people bound for a mysterious rural settlement called &quot;Nanaki Village&quot;, a place which supposedly cannot be found on any map for unknown reasons. The purpose of the trip is supposedly for all the passengers to start over with new lives for themselves due to their respective personal circumstances. After some troubles, they arrive at the village only to find out that it&#039;s abandoned, and soon enough strange things start happening around them. Some people disappear whilst exploring the village, and mysterious claw marks dripping with blood are found in the forest. This all has the setup for an obvious horror story where people will get killed from the shadows or something along those lines, which would have been the obvious solution to the problem of the overwhelming size of the character cast: I.E: by killing off the majority of them. But strangely enough that&#039;s not what happens.<br />
<br />
Instead, Mayoiga descends down a spiral of &quot;wtf am I watching&quot; as the characters first turn on each other only to then keep changing their minds on who&#039;s guilty of what every 2 minutes, and absurd supernatural events seemingly start to occur with &quot;monsters&quot; straight out of Disneyland appearing everywhere. It&#039;s one big scrambled mess which barely makes any sense, but above all it&#039;s completely impossible to take seriously. I find it hard to believe that you&#039;re really supposed to be scared or intrigued by this, because the only thing it ever makes you do is laugh out loud at how unbelievably stupid and nonsensical the things that are happening are. And while the story admittedly does start to make sense towards the end, at that point you don&#039;t even care anymore.<br />
<br />
What really makes Mayoiga stand out though is the character cast itself. I don&#039;t really know how to put this other than that it&#039;s absolutely *horrible*. Like record levels of awful. I&#039;ve already mentioned the huge problem of it being impossible to remember the names of more than a handful of them, but on top of that not a single one of them is likable. At all. They all behave like complete and utter retards from start to finish, blatantly changing their opinions whenever someone else brings up any new piece of information, they all have needlessly cliché and bland backstories which you don&#039;t even want to hear in the first place, and they&#039;re just plain annoying to watch. They&#039;re completely incapable of handling the situation they find themselves in and they act paranoid beyond belief for almost no reason. I guess you could argue that a group of people who think that running away from society by joining some shady bus trip to a rural village probably aren&#039;t the smartest people to begin with, but still. That sounds more like a bad excuse than anything else.<br />
<br />
The MC is a weak, gullible boy called Mitsumune who feels like the most unsuitable person imaginable to be the protagonist of a horror/mystery show, and he just ends up coming off as annoying more often than not. Worst of all though, there&#039;s this one psychopathic girl called Lovepon who does nothing but desperately yell the word &quot;Execute!&quot; at any given moment, and is one of the most obnoxious characters I&#039;ve ever seen. She reminds me of Nina Einstein from Code Geass a lot (protip: that&#039;s not a good thing). She wants to kill everyone for the slightest suspicious move, yet everyone else seems to trust her instincts completely above anyone else who says otherwise. Like really? Can&#039;t you like… see that this girl is completely mentally unstable? Why are you going along with her as if she&#039;s reliable or something? I seriously don&#039;t get it. Who&#039;s more stupid: the idiot or the people who actually believe in her? In any case the entire cast are basically cardboard cutouts of various common anime tropes, with their specific traits cranked up to the max but their IQ dragged down to under 50. There is absolutely nothing to make the viewers feel any sympathy or connection to them, and as a result you just end up not caring about what happens to them. There is basically no depth or character development at all. Yes, we get a lot of tragic backstories from them spoon-fed to us, but those are all so incredibly bland and generic that it doesn&#039;t actually help their cause much to speak of. Rather it just ends up feeling like a waste of screen time.<br />

So as far as being a horror/mystery goes, Mayoiga is in my mind one of the worst anime ever made. However, there is one saving grace for this show, albeit an unintentional one. And that is quite simply that it&#039;s actually pretty funny. Sure it&#039;s for all the wrong reasons, but either way the sheer amount of stupidity in the scriptwriting results in some comedic genius. The characters consistently do the most idiotic things that will catch you off guard and just make you laugh at how dumb they are. And don&#039;t even get me started on the so-called &quot;horror&quot; elements of this show. Just... just see for yourselves and you&#039;ll see what I mean; they look so ridiculously dumb it&#039;s hilarious. And because of that, the actual entertainment value of this anime is actually decent despite it being awful in basically all other categories, hence why I&#039;m still generous enough to give it a 4 in the end. As for whether being &quot;so bad it&#039;s funny&quot; is enough of a motivation to actually watch the show though... well that probably just comes down to your sense of humor. Maybe it will, maybe it won&#039;t. Only one way to find out. Mayoiga is not an anime you laugh with. It&#039;s an anime you laugh at.

    Okay, at first episode I thought this anime got potential, maybe something that stand out from the rest of anime this season, well I wasn&#039;t completely wrong. <br />
<br />
This anime got too many characters and hardly any of them are importants. Most of them are fucking annoying, make me want to punch my computer&#039;s screen hoping my fist would break through dimension knock them the fuck out. God, fucking Lovepon and her EXECUTION! <br />
<br />
This anime do a poor making me care about any of the characters. These characters are all losers who want to escape their lives because they fucking suck. We slowly learn how lame

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221487">
        they are and then we got their weird fucking trauma manifest as creepy fucking shit. One of them got silicon as his trauma monster because he got one implant inside his head to make him taller, fucking lol. I kid you not.<br />
<br />
Each episodes make you question the characters capability to use their brains because nothing they do make fucking sense. If you expect any good explaination for everything that&#039;s going in the series, you won&#039;t. I mean they explains it but its garbage. <br />
<br />
Overall, I regret watching this anime. I never give an anime such a low score but this anime deserve all of it. Fucking garbage.

    NOT FOR THE WEAK-MINDED<br />
Ok first of all. This anime obviously made a lot of people disappointed, but just because it was able to do that was I able to enjoy it even more than I already had. This anime was tagged as Mystery and for the entirety of it I was just left wondering at awe in every episode. Even though the flow of the story was bad and it could&#039;ve gone way better, I was able to enjoy this anime because of how crazy it is and how people are getting frustrated over it.<br />
<br />
Story(6)<br />
Yeah the story is pretty bland and the flow is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221068">
        bit horrible but it&#039;s certainly not mediocre because it is pretty damn unique.<br />
<br />
Art(8)<br />
The visuals were great and the monsters/Nanaki were just awesomely creepy.<br />
<br />
Sound(8)<br />
The audio was pretty great actually. I really like the ED song. Oh, and of course how could I forget Koharun&#039;s eerie song.<br />
<br />
Character(7)<br />
It&#039;s good. Not great, but good. Each had their own unique crazy personality.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(10)<br />
It was like riding a roller-coaster &#039;nuff said.<br />
<br />
Overall(8)<br />
I don&#039;t understand why people are giving it a lot of hate. It&#039;s certainly cut from a different cloth, that much I can say. I won&#039;t be able to see an anime as crazy as this one for a long while and I&#039;m glad because I myself might also become even crazier if I keep watching more anime like this. It&#039;s a pretty great anime and it&#039;s definitely not for sane people.

    Mayoiga, the anime deemed &quot;Comedy of the season&quot;. Personally, I find it quite appealing that someone would deem this &quot;masterpiece&quot; a comedy. <br />
<br />
Story is a 7/10 from me. People go in a village, stuff happens, silent hill vibes. 7/10<br />
<br />
Art 9/10, fluid art animation is quite seller. Much appreciated. <br />
<br />
Everything else *8/10) Characters were unique, concept was good. Got a Law exam tomorrow. <br />
<br />
Overall 7.5/10 or 8/10.<br />
<br />
Kept me interested, one of the most important pieces of modern day anime.<br />
<br />
Ok im going to go study now, bye. <br />
<br />
..<br />
<br />
Hold on, if this anime was really that bad, then...why is it getting good reviews.<br />
<br />
People die if they are killed.<br />
<br />
Tuturuu

    Remember when &quot;Lost&quot; (American Live Action Series) became an omelette of horrible ideas? &quot;Bus Show&quot; creators must have thought that was good writing and made a show out of it.<br />
<br />
*Spoiler Alert*<br />
<br />
The cast is one of many assaults on one&#039;s sanity. The characters as I recall are listed like this: Harem Gay, Harem Gay&#039;s Best Friend, Love Interest (sometimes Bow Girl), Pikachu, Uzi Chick, Military Guy, Pirate Jack, Other Jack, Larry (refer to Phoenix Wright), Execute Girl, Soy Latte (actual name), Small Beard, and Black Dude. There are a ton of other people, but no one cares. This show damned itself by having such a large

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221262">
        cast in such a small show. There were attempts to make us relate to and like this enormous cast. Unfortunately, you cannot have character development or character-viewer relations built between so many people as quickly as they tried to make this happen. They failed at both jobs. <br />
<br />
How are all these interesting people together in the same place? They took the bus to a village where they wanted to make a commune of dysfunctional kids. This village is something something Nanaki something something ghosts from your past something something giant tit. Yes, a literal giant tit haunted Military Guy. He is not the only guy with a stupid background and a stupid spirit/inner demon. Our resident hard-ass Small Beard is terrified of Thomas the Tank Engine with googly eyes because he was laughed during work because his failed plans. The giant penguin and Horde mount are debatably the most legitimate inner fears. The sheer amount of stupid ideas made me feel like a brain surgeon was giving me a noogie with grip tape. It hurts. <br />
<br />
The only hope for the show after episode 2/3 was to go full slasher flick. Cheesy slasher flicks are easy to execute and no one expects a good twist at the end. Instead Black Dude isn&#039;t actually dead. He was talking to a guy he called God who was a researcher on the village because he was interested in bullshit. He could have studied manure and accomplish more than what he did. <br />
<br />
In the very end after everyone made peace with their inner demons and after one of the kids have to say that it is some random chick that was the bad guy all along, because they didn&#039;t specify that well enough, they sang a song called the Unlucky Hippopotamus. That is what every unfortunate viewer of the show is. An Unlucky Hippopotamus. Congrats.<br />

     Many people within the anime community complain about the degrading quality of modern anime works.  Though I always try to view anime in a positive light, I can&#039;t deny that Mayoiga is a great example of this. I mean it was so mediocre and pretentious and it just fell into an eternal abyss of dissapointment. <br />
<br />
The lost village is the type of show that tries several ideas and concepts but fails miserably at several of these endeavors. It desperately attempts to incorporate deep themes but can hardly get down dynamic characterization and development, not to mention a completely muddled narrative.<br />
<br />
 The story of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221185">
        Mayoiga follows thirty young individuals who are going to a village to escape all of their problems. This is an incredibly promising concept which could have been amazing if it was handled and developed properly. However a main issue is that a core story doesn&#039;t really appear until midway through the entire series. This leads to much confusion throughout the entire series because even after a narrative is established it doesn&#039;t take long for it to completely fall apart. <br />
<br />
The main characters of Mayoiga had great potential. The character of mitsumune had an interesting backstory and some valid motivation. However he is a really annoying and bland character and he hardly grows throughout the story. Masaki is kind of the standard timid quiet innocent girl that is very generic. Koharun was also pretty bland but there was a good plot twist involving her. Hayato was probably the best and most interesting character and his motives were very relatable. <br />
<br />
The other side characters in Mayoiga is the perfect example of a large amount of characters who don&#039;t mean crap to the viewer. Honestly just info dumping their backstories at random is not a good way to develop a character. Their were a couple of semi-interesting side characters but the rest were just hit garbage. The cast was way too big and it really hindered the potential of the show.<br />
<br />
The themes of accepting your psychological scars is explored through characters I can hard,y care about. This makes the anime very pretentious due to it trying to be deep but failing miserably. <br />
<br />
The art of Mayoiga is actually good. There is a feel of modern polish and I had no problem with it. The voice acting was also good and the actors portrayed their respective characters accurately. The music was excellent with a great opening and ending themes. The ost also built good atmosphere. <br />
<br />
In conclusion Mayoiga is a series that had an amazing amount of potential in its premise but just completely flopped. It has some redeemable aspects but there are much better less pretentious mystery anime out there so I can&#039;t reccomened this anime.

    2/10 is actually a rather generous score for an anime so abysmal. If MAL offered negative scores, I may have spitefully given it a -2 rather than a positive one.<br />
<br />
I trudged through all twelve episodes, wasting 22 minutes of my life every week hoping that somehow, the plot would actually slowly turn good, and the characters wouldn&#039;t be so goddamn obnoxious. Didn&#039;t happen. I&#039;m asking God for a refund of those minutes after I die one day.<br />
<br />
First off: Why the everloving frick would you have 30 characters in a show that&#039;s only twelve episodes?! With so little time to develop anyone as a character, it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221774">
        a wonder that they even thought that that was a good idea. Honestly, over 2/3 the cast could&#039;ve been tossed away and nothing from the show would&#039;ve changed. It was an unnecessary waste and barely anyone was given decent character development. In so-called horror/mystery shows such as this, it is crucial to have characters that the audience can root for or relate to. No such thing here. By the time episode 2-3 finished  practically everyone watching was hoping that the whole cast would just die. Not to mention, the characters who are presented more often are meh at best and fucking annoying at worst. They&#039;re all one-trick ponies who have one defining trait and nothing else explored about them. They have &quot;&quot;backstories&quot;&quot;, but those are just another bad attempt at trying to get the viewer to sympathize for them (one was bullied, one tried to get into the military and failed, one did something wrong on a business deal, one was abused by a stepfather, etc.) and though you may feel bad for them a bit, it doesn&#039;t change the fact that most of them are useless and annoying characters. There are points where you may think that certain people got character development, and then, BAM! They reverted back to the way they were. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ <br />
<br />
I&#039;d talk about a story if there actually was one. Every time there&#039;s a mystery, there&#039;s always a crappy, half-assed explanation, followed by another mystery that is inevitably going to end up with the same crappy half-assed explanation by the next episode. At the series&#039; end, there were still many questions left unanswered. The characters themselves are so annoying that it&#039;s actually hard to focus on the story (or on whether the story is actually there or not). <br />
<br />
The art is the best part of the series. It&#039;s not too bad.<br />
<br />
The OP/ED were nice to listen to, but they&#039;re easily skippable. I didn&#039;t really pay attention to the sound in the series otherwise.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: unless you are fond of subjecting yourself to torture in all sorts of forms, don&#039;t watch this show. it&#039;s a waste of your time.

    Hey, are you looking for a well made mystery anime that boasts a suspenseful plot with intriguing characters? Then DON&#039;T watch Mayoiga! This show failed miserably to be the good mystery anime that it tried so hard to be. Mayoiga got consistently worse and more agrivating to watch as each episode passed by. In fact, it almost drove me to take a bus tour to an abandoned town divode of life and technology myself just so that I wouldn&#039;t have to watch this disgrace on my PC every week.<br />
<br />
Plot: 1/10<br />
<br />
With an intriguing (albeit kinda stupid) premise, I figured that the overall story would at least

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222116">
        be somewhat interesting. However, since episode one the plot practically disappeared in a similar way to how some of the characters in this show vanished. And by that I mean in a vague and unexplained manner. The writers just seemed to disregard whatever plot elements they had in mind to specifically focus on the stupidity of the characters. The story doesn&#039;t go anywhere due to the singular focus on the idiotic decisions made by the anime&#039;s cast. Mayoiga unintentionally transferred from a mystery to a comedy. I won&#039;t go into detail on this point, but if you watch the anime, you&#039;ll understand where I&#039;m coming from. The writing in this show is absolutely horrid.<br />
<br />
Animation: 4/10<br />
<br />
The art is quite basic. The majority of the characters each have their own original design, although they&#039;re animated in a rather simplistic manner. There&#039;s not much to say about the scenery, which is also kind of underwhelming. My main issue has to be the cgi monsters that appear. They&#039;re so poorly designed that I couldn&#039;t help but chuckle a bit when I first saw them. <br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10<br />
<br />
The opening theme song is rather average and isn&#039;t anything special. The ending is mediocre and skippable. The background soundtrack helps keep the mood tense and edgy during suspenseful scenes- oh wait, there aren&#039;t any in this anime! The voice acting is average and bland, and I really don&#039;t like the main characters voice. It&#039;s rather annoying. <br />
<br />
Characters: 1/10<br />
<br />
If you ever decide to create a twelve episode long anime, never, under any circumstances, have a cast of over thirty characters. That&#039;s right, the geniuses who created Mayoiga thought that they&#039;d be able to effectively develop OVER THIRTY CHARACTERS in just TWELVE EPISODES. As you can imagine, the majority of the characters don&#039;t even have a personality, much less any development. Practically all of the characters are so stupid that I almost want to smash my head through a concrete tablet when I watch them. They&#039;re so disorganized, paranoid, and have no idea how to deal with the undesirable situations that they find themselves in. Then again, what else can you expect from a bunch of ignoramuses who want to escape society by taking a sketchy bus tour to an uncharted town that has a very probable chance of not even existing. Oh, and instead of developing as characters as the anime progressed, the doofuses in this show somehow manage to get even stupider and more annoying with each passing episode. Now that&#039;s an accomplishment!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2/10<br />
<br />
Although I had hopes that Mayorga would be able to keep me entertained, my expectations were shattered almost immediately. By the latter half of the anime I even started cringing every time a character said something stupid, which was approximately every time they opened their mouths. While I was initially intrigued with this show due to the mysterious aspects of Mayoiga, I later found myself laughing at scenes that I assume were meant to be &quot;unnerving&quot; or &quot;scary&quot; due to Mayoiga&#039;s poor execution mixed with its abysmal cast of characters.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2/10<br />
<br />
It was very clear from the beginning that Mayoiga had the makings of a flawed anime. Nonetheless, I held on to the hope that it would be able to find some success. Unfortunately, the show just got worse and worse with each passing episode until it reached a point where it actually became painful to watch. Overall, Mayoiga is simply a very poorly constructed show that failed to deliver.

    I swear! The only good thing about this horrible show was probably the art. The characters were awful. Every single episode, they kept screaming and acting like idiots. It completely ruined the whole show for me!<br />
<br />
None of them made any sense. They acted unreasonable. The only good characters were like two of them. The rest of them acted like complete retards who kept wanting to &quot;control&quot; the situation by themselves! Especially Lovepon! Oh god she was the worst! She kept going on and on about the execution crap!<br />
<br />
And what was with the ending!? After all that crap about beating each other, they suddenly started to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221264">
        act civilized!? Also the drama was awful! Most of the time, it felt forced. Honestly, I feel like the writers were pulling this story out of their asses each episode!<br />
<br />
I mean. The concept was really cool, but the execution (no pun intended) was awful, especially with such horrible characters. I would NEVER recommend this anime.<br />
<br />
Story: 3 (I only rated it a little higher cause the concept was cool.)<br />
Art: 7<br />
Sound: 5<br />
Character: 1 (I have never seen worse personalities before!)<br />
Enjoyment: 3<br />
<br />
Overall: 3<br />

    Mayoiga, was one of the most interesting anime in the spring season of 2016, there is a reason why I added &quot;was&quot; because it literally was interesting for the first 3 episodes or so.<br />
<br />
let&#039;s talk about the story, a group of strangers on a trip to an unknown village. a lot of people got excited because those kinds of stories are really famous and they always turn out to be good BUT not in Mayoiga. don&#039;t get fooled by its misleading genre of Horror, Mystery, Drama, and Violence. they made it seem like it would be so scary with a lot of deaths, blood and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221269">
        gore but no no no that was all a lie, it is more of stupid comedy than a drama anime LOL.<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
<br />
I loved the fact that it was a mystery anime and in fact it was the anime i looked most forward to this season, i was wrong. so people who go to &quot;Nanaki Village&quot; get to face their Nanaki (monsters) made from their psychological scars and fears(?) not bad but the name just didn&#039;t know what to do with the story and thought &quot;oh why don&#039;t we create stupid monsters that will haunt their owners until they accept them&quot; ??????? that is so stupid, the story for me was the worst part.<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10 --- Sound 7/10<br />
<br />
Character designs were good but not so special, the Animation was better but not the kind that i&#039;d call &quot;AMAZING&quot; let&#039;s talk about how bad the Monsters&#039; animation was, CGI? seriously CGI??? i really really hated it how the used CGI for the monsters, it just looked so bad like so so bad i don&#039;t want to even talk about it anymore.<br />
I personally liked the opening and ending, mostly the opening, the opening was very good for me, the ending was okay. some characters had good voices and some had really bad which made them even more hate-able.<br />
<br />
Character: 2/10<br />
<br />
yes i gave it a 2!! main male character is the stupidest ever, main female is the &quot;dumb, scared from everything&quot; character you see everywhere even though she was cute, other characters were so bad and annoying, and let&#039;s talk about Love-pon, &quot;execute him&quot; &quot;execute her&quot; &quot;execution time&quot; sweety please go execute yourself. seriously if you want the anime to do good then you should have created likeable characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t even know why or how, i gave it a 6 because i did enjoy the anime a bit, it had that feeling of &quot;keep watching me&quot; even though it was stupid, but still its not that enjoyable that you&#039;d go and re-watch some scenes. <br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10<br />
<br />
bad story<br />
bad characters<br />
good/okay soundtracks and OST<br />
animation not special and ugly use of CGI<br />
average, average, bad, average anime<br />
yes that is all, it&#039;s like the creators made the anime bad on purpose, but i won&#039;t say that i wasted a lot of time watching Mayoiga, it taught me again to never judge a book by its cover.

    I went into this anime with the expectation that it would have a very Danganronpa-esque feel, minus the hope versus despair struggle. As it turns out, I was wrong because I kept hoping it would get better as the show went on and was met instead with disappointment and despair that a show as bland as Mayoiga wasn&#039;t canceled by the third episode.<br />
<br />
All this poorly structured show has to offer is four and a half hours of content so boring that it will make watching paint dry a thrill by comparison.<br />
<br />
Ironically, despite not killing even one of the thirty characters first introduced, this anime managed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review228254">
        to be lifeless all the way to the very end. I couldn&#039;t bring myself to care about a single person introduced except the bus driver. I could barely remember more than three of the characters&#039; names, and most of that is only due to the fact that they were being constantly shouted throughout the episodes. Because Mayoiga failed to point out just one or two protagonists, much of the screentime that could&#039;ve helped develop stronger viewer connections was wasted on scenes with minor characters that truly didn&#039;t contribute to the story whatsoever. <br />
<br />
While this is certainly not the first anime to have characters that suffer from same-face syndrome, it didn&#039;t help that everyone also reacted to every situation in one of two ways: unnecessary anger or complete calm. Occasionally, they would act finnicky and contradict themselves to progress the story. Eventually, these responses were so predictable that I found myself struggling to keep my eyes open, even as the characters faced perilous situations because, morality considered, I simply didn&#039;t care what happened to them. This apathy towards the enormous cast is mainly attributed to having way too many characters thrown at the viewer within the first few minutes and on top of that, attaching meaningless nicknames to every single one and switching between those and their real names for most of the series. Two&#039;s company, three&#039;s a crowd, and Mayoiga is a trainwreck. I wish it were a bus wreck so that maybe half of the cast could&#039;ve been taken out and this anime would have a chance of being kind of okay.<br />
<br />
While mysteries can be criticized for many things, the one thing they ought not be lacking in is intrigue. Viewers should be captivated by the story and anticipate answers to the questions posed by a mystery show and yet, each of the alluring ideas posed in the first episode were met with pretty understimulating explanations. These unsatisfying shortcomings sprinkled into the disorganized plotline were widely responsible for the decline of interest in the engimas that remained. There were far too many useless diversions to the main mystery at inopportune times which may have intended to build suspense but backfired horribly. A few of the characters&#039; tragic backstories were developed which, one would hope, usually helps viewers relate. (Spoiler alert: it didn&#039;t work.) The others were thrown under the bus (not literally, but I crossed my fingers for this a lot) although perhaps this is a blessing because I would likely find the insides of my eyelids more interesting. Ultimately, if I don&#039;t care about a character, I&#039;m not going to care about their past, no matter how traumatic you attempt to convince me it is. <br />
<br />
The final episode left me just as disillusioned as I always am after staring at Mayoiga for 24-ish minutes and asking myself when I became such a masochist. The conclusion fell flat and truly, I&#039;m not mad... I&#039;m just disappointed. The unveiling of the antagonist&#039;s motive for pulling the strings behind the scenes was sketchy at best, as it didn&#039;t really explain most of their actions or how they could&#039;ve pulled off what they did. A lot of loose ends were left untied and surprise, surprise, the climax of the story was so underwhelming I think I&#039;ll never have to take Zzzquil to go to sleep again. <br />
<br />
Tldr; &quot;The Lost Village&quot; should be changed to &quot;The Lost Interest.&quot; I&#039;ve yawned so much watching this series that I&#039;m going to join Evanescence so someone can wake me up inside. Don&#039;t waste your time.

    There was a little anime and when it was good, it was really really good, but when it was bad, it was really really bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mayoiga would probably be best described as a psychological supernatural thriller. There is no gore, no murders, no blood, ghosts or epic battle scenes. What this anime does deliver though is monsters, mysteries and cliffhanger moments by the bucket load.<br />
<br />
Story in a nutshell: A large group of unrelated &amp; dysfunctional people disenchanted with society run away together to start their lives anew in a mysterious village which exists on no mainstream maps. The village is full of mysteries and it is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222154">
        not long before people start to get tormented by monsters.<br />
<br />
<br />
I found this anime challenging to rate because while petty bad, it is not awful at everything it does. And the thing it does best is mystery. That even as dysfunctional as the anime is (poor pacing, a myriad of useless characters etc), it often keeps you just hooked enough to continue baring with it.<br />
<br />
Overall: Good story with so much potential and creativity but very let down by poor pacing, illogical character interaction and poor character design (and too many characters in general). <br />
Mysteries abound in this anime but unfortunately so too does disappointment.  <br />

    Apparently, Mayoiga is categorized as a mystery anime, but the real mystery is figuring out what the fuck was going on half the time, and not really in a good way. One of the most talked about anime of Spring ‘16, Mayoiga deceived whatever target audiences it was trying to lure in; at first it seemed like a group of weirdos assimilating into an uncharted society, then it seemed to be a murder mystery, but really it was… a psychological “horror” involving freaky CG monsters.<br />
<br />
Oh.<br />
<br />
Mayo-egg starts off with thirty Redditors getting on a bus headed for the middle of nowhere, so they can start new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220988">
        lives in an uncharted village. Fucking millennials these days. And I almost wanted to drop the show after the first five minutes, because they were spent on introducing each character, one by one, as if anyone’s expected to remember them. And they’re ALL tropes. I get that only a fucking crazy idiot would get on this magic school bus to hell, but very few are actually insane… everyone else is just an anime trope. The guy who raps all the time. The guy who eats food all the time. The potential serial murderer who doesn’t talk. Is this supposed to be some big joke?<br />
<br />
Apparently it is, actually. A lot of people have concluded that Mayoiga’s general lack of seriousness and incredibly trope-y characters make this a comedy series rather than some horrific drama. So uh… when exactly was I supposed to laugh? “Hurr hurr, this guy’s getting chased by a giant boob monster!” Alright, yeah, that’s pretty weird. Anything else? ‘Cuz people taking silly situations really seriously… isn’t a very uncommon thing in anime, specifically bad anime. Maybe I just don’t enjoy subtle humor in general, because I was only interested when the really crazy shit was happening. All hail Lovepon. But otherwise, I wasn’t amused by the mob mentality of the villagers or their dumb conversations and theories.<br />
<br />
I do believe this could’ve at least been improved easily, though. They should’ve reduced the headcount significantly. This statement is a small spoiler, but only one person dies. With the amount of characters, it’s no surprise that most people expected a weekly massacre. (RIP to the guy on /r/anime who made a status chart for this exact reason.) But no, everyone sticks around and pops up every now and then (“then” being “maybe once every three episodes if they’re lucky”) to give their amazing (read: fucking annoying) one-liner, then back to filler hell they go. Keep the characters that actually have presence. No one cares about the guy who talks about eating, or Yuuna, or Yuuna, or Yuuna. Having less characters would at least give an excuse to have more CG monsters. <br />
<br />
If anything, violence would’ve made the show more entertaining. Or maybe if this turned into a huge game of Town of Salem. Ever played that? It’s a game where the townspeople have to find everyone evil and hang them, or the evil people have to kill all the townspeople. Watching everyone point fingers furiously and falsely killing off each other would’ve been a fun time for the whole family. But instead of a simple, entertaining show to watch while getting shit-faced drunk with your friends, Shirobako’s director goes with… people getting attacked by monsters created by their mental stress. You know, the classic.<br />
<br />
I guess it’s one thing to be surprising, and Mayoiga is pretty interesting and creative with its concept, but it’s like mixing peanut butter with mac and cheese. They’re both awesome on their own, but putting them together is strange and not very fun. We’ll be right back after this public service announcement.<br />
<br />
[The author of this review recommends that you do not mix peanut butter with mac and cheese. It does not taste good. Thank you for your attention.]<br />
<br />
Anyway, I’m not really sure what this anime was supposed to be. If it was a drama, it was too wacky to take seriously. If it was a mystery, it didn’t leave people guessing, just in a state of confusion. If it was a comedy, it simply wasn’t funny enough. And if it was supposed to be all of them at once… well, it sucked.<br />
<br />
The art just kinda sucks. That’s it. Nothing is specifically bad about it, it’s just kinda mediocre because most of it is people standing or sitting around, talking. Facial expressions and camera angles don’t do anything to help or harm it, but the lighting is pretty decent, as much of the show takes place during the night, so expect a lot of dimly lit rooms and… campfires. Yeah, campfires. For roasting marshmallows, and sometimes witches. The CG is beyond jarring, it’s fucking hyper-realistic like we’re in a shitty creepypasta. But that’s kinda the point and they’re consistent with it, so it’s good in a strange way? Quite an oddity, it is.<br />
<br />
If this show had music, let me know. ‘Cuz I sure as hell didn’t notice anything. The OP is about average; the song has some heart but sounds cheaply produced; the mixing doesn’t sound very even, and the instrumentation sounds lacking, somehow. But it has a good vocal melody, at least. The ED is a strange, but fitting song to close each episode with; it’s a soft acoustic ballad and it’s quite nice. I don’t have anything to say about the voiceovers because of the sheer number, but whoever played the based goddess Lovepon is pretty good.<br />
<br />
Did I enjoy Mayoiga? Eh. I didn’t not enjoy it, save for the extremely slow start. But with a general lack of focus, I don’t think it was a matter of not enjoying it, it’s just that there wasn’t much to enjoy.<br />

    There&#039;s this 2015 movie called Tag that&#039;s on Youtube as of this moment. It&#039;s by my favorite present-day foreign film director, Sion Sono, and it&#039;s easily one of the best modern-day horror movies I&#039;ve seen in a long time. It was creepy. It was funny. Its take on puberty was pretty cool. And even if you don&#039;t agree with me on the film&#039;s quality, I think most of you would be hard-pressed to deny that it was better than watching Diomedea&#039;s attempt at scaring the living daylights out of people with their shitty horror comedy about a bunch of faceless rejects whining about personal problems

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224202">
        no one gives a shit about.<br />
<br />
Okay okay, I know I&#039;m setting a low bar when bringing up the name, Diomedea - a studio so faceless and forgettable that I&#039;ll bet most of you fans of the magical boy high school show aren&#039;t aware that they&#039;re the ones behind it. And it&#039;s true, my reaction to most horror anime is about as positive as a baby fry&#039;s when they instantly wake up to their mother about to celebrate their birth by swallowing them whole. So to say I was shocked that Mayoiga ended up being crap is like saying the majority of the U.K.&#039;s intelligent population was surprised that Boris Johnson didn&#039;t keep the majority of his manifesto promises when it came time to deliver on them.<br />
<br />
In fact, the only thing that was shocking about this show was the cult fanbase that erupted in its wake. I wasn&#039;t sure what they were seeing at first until I realized that the director was Tsutomu Mizushima - the guy who gave us critically acclaimed shows like Shirobako and unintentionally funny trash like Another - and that everybody who went into this show knew he was the guy behind the anime beforehand. No seriously. Name me one guy who loved this anime&#039;s atrociousness that didn&#039;t look up who the director was. Apparently, in order to enjoy this anime and that godawful Hippopotamus song, you&#039;d have to know the director, have watched Another, have found that show hilarious, and make constant comparisons to that show whilst using other people who think similarly to back you up. Those are not acceptable conditions for liking a show! That&#039;s ten levels below needing to read the original source material in order to appreciate an adaptation.<br />
<br />
But let&#039;s talk about the anime itself. It&#039;s focused on a group of thirty boys and girls...guys, if you want to make Battle Royale, just make Battle Royale. Lord knows we could use an actual animated adaptation of that rather than another goddamn copycat that only barely acknowledges the original inspiration. Anyways, it&#039;s about a group of thirty on a tour to a mysterious village so they can start over their lives or something. I dunno. The details of the tour were so loosely defined that apparently one person joined just so she could shoot things without anyone complaining. When they get to the village, they discover it&#039;s been abandoned and certain members of their tour start mysteriously disappearing, so they start looking for...bwahahaha! Actually, they just mostly ignore the people who disappear in favor of discovering the secrets of the village itself. And trust me when I say that Nanaki Village ain&#039;t exactly Gravity Falls.<br />
<br />
The series basically goes through its story by having each episode consist of one section of the main cast searching for answers, another section revealing their pathetic sob story that will in no way affect the plot other than influencing whatever CG monster ends up chasing them, and a section where the characters just act crazy for no reason other than they can. Oh yeah, I should probably explain those CG monsters. They&#039;re basically supposed to be physical manifestations of the characters&#039; deepest fears, so they take the form of giant bees or penguins or whatever the fuck you call Hayato&#039;s thing that looks like a cross between a homeless woman, a malformed spider, and a giant turd. And to be fair, the fears do have potential on paper like parental abuse and dead family. But it also matters how you convey those fears, and Mayoiga seems to think that the best way to do that is to say the children have them. Well tough, but so do a lot of people in real life. What makes these fictional characters special?<br />
<br />
Also, the solutions these characters come up with to resolve their issues are pathetic. Nothing but power of friendship and yelling their feelings, which is the fucking white noise of teen drama resolution at this point. Not saying that that can&#039;t be an effective way to resolve a conflict, but Haibane Renmei&#039;s finale earned it through its strong usage of religious metaphors supplementing a sin that&#039;s vaguely defined on purpose towards a character that was more than just a cliche. Mayoiga has nothing of the sort to elevate the drama but camp, and really shitty camp to boot. There&#039;s a scene where the characters are threatened by fire arrows (fucking rolling in creativity right here) and all they can do is react to getting shot the same way most people react to watching The Neon Demon after ingesting sleeping pills. Granted they were under a spell that made them lethargic, but when someone flat-out states that a fire arrow isn&#039;t effective as a lethal weapon to justify their drowsiness whilst another person states you need to bring a matchlock gun to get them scared, I start rolling my eyes. Even if they look lame and you can&#039;t cause a fire with them, a fire arrow will still kill you if it hits you in the fucking neck.<br />
<br />
Mind you, I would have done less eye-rolling if that had actually happened. Or if anyone had actually died in this show. Yeah, despite the fact that it&#039;s marketed as a horror story and borrows heavily from works that feature creative ways to kill people, every single character is alive by the time the series ends. Not a single one is beheaded or set on fire or even given as much as a scar in this show despite multiple opportunities to do so. And no, I&#039;m not for torture and brutal deaths even if it&#039;s done to characters I don&#039;t like, but you might as well have gone that route and entertained someone in the audience if you weren&#039;t going to give us anything other than this half-assed attempt at a redemption story. I was talking about this show with a bunch of friends at Expo and we all agreed at being super disappointed that nothing even approaching a bloodbath ever occurred. When we expect a setup similar to Battle Royale, we expect an ending similar to Battle Royale as well.<br />
<br />
I could go on complaining about everything else this show does wrong (Hayato&#039;s possessive nature towards the main dude, anyone?), but I&#039;ve got limited time this weekend and most of you guys have already moved on from the show by now, so let&#039;s just get to the important questions.<br />
<br />
Is it scary? No. The monsters look worse than the CG alien from Howard the Duck, they move so slow that they couldn&#039;t catch up to a bus dragging the Statue of Liberty behind it, the tonal shifts ruin any sense of dread, and you cannot seriously expect me to believe that a penguin whose only method of attack is to punch you with its flipper could possibly threaten my life any more than I could threaten his with a kick to the stomach.<br />
<br />
Is it funny? No. There&#039;s way too much expository dialogue, the imagination in these scenarios is bog-standard, and I have it on good authority that anticlimaxes that halt plot progression (and more importantly, seeing these unlikable characters fall into a grinder) have never in the history of mankind been humorous.<br />
<br />
Is the psychology interesting? For a first draft maybe. This entire show feels like it got animated because the final script burnt up in an accident and all the production team had to meet the deadline was something they had previously thrown away once they were done choosing a compelling direction to take these elements. Nothing about this show feels like the creators were giving it their all, like they realized what sort of crap they were dealing with it and proceeded to just not care. The animation and cinematography are incredibly flat, the character designs clash badly with the setting like putting the cast of Dragonball Z into Shin Sekai Yori, and the ending feels like something M. Night Shyamalan&#039;s malfunctioning robot clone would come up with before getting thrown into the trash heap.<br />
<br />
Is my review of this show over? Yes it is. I&#039;ve got better things to do than wasting anymore of my time on this pig shit. Like reviewing Big Order...oh wait.
