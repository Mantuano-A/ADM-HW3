    Obviously, your 1st reaction so far will be you&amp;rsquo;re thinking Initial D. I don&amp;rsquo;t blame anybody for doing so, but if you&amp;rsquo;re going to watch this with expectations based on Initial D, then you&amp;rsquo;re going to watch it for all the wrong reasons. The 1st portion of this series will be repetitive and slow, but it&amp;rsquo;s done for the purpose to build suspense, motivate development, and establish the story. I felt that things got exciting way too much at the end and it leaves you wanting for more, but I guess there&amp;rsquo;s the manga to make you satisfied which I&amp;rsquo;m now getting into. Depending on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8579">
        how you get into it, it will be either hard or easy to accept, but I feel this presentation was done for the right reasons even though it will take awhile to get into this anime. Yes, consequences of that kind of story telling makes the pace slow, but it gives chances to focus and introduce other characters and their relationships which the anime is truly about.<br />
<br />
The anime has great character exploration. I really like how the racing lifestyle and car obsession results in consequences to the normal lives of the characters and in relation to those around them. In the case of Akio, he has to repeat a year of high school because he ditches to make money for his car.<br />
<br />
However, I felt there were some characters that had no use or contribution to the progression or establishment of the story, though they had an interesting origin and develop individually. But in the end, they seemed more like filler or side story characters, and felt the anime could have focused on other things instead. But regardless, these characters were likeable and engaging. As for the main characters, I felt their personalities were too strong and established to make any significant development throughout the course of this anime, but I think it was mostly about the relationships and interactions that were more of the central focus.<br />
<br />
There is heavy duty tech speak, but I felt it was really easy to understand because it demonstrates the explanations hand in hand very effectively. But because the series is seriously technical, chances are you may be turned off by it because it gets really deep and I know a lot of people were turned off by this in Initial D because it was used as a riddle for foreshadowing thus made it very confusing to those not familiar with cars, but with Wangan Midnight, I felt it&amp;rsquo;s presentation made it like an auto class. But the drama thanks to the back-story of the Devil Z, is odd but engagingly driven in its own right. It does create a sense of curiosity of whether or not there is something possessing the Z, but its history and its tuning has a certain aura to it that attracts the characters, thus moves the story.<br />
<br />
Well, the character designs share an obvious resemblance of Initial D&amp;rsquo;s, but simpler looking. The art design will of course look more dated since the original manga came out in 1992 and is sticking true to the original designs. Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s really nothing cutting edge, nor is it really over the top. So the awkward designs will probably turn off people, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it should really overall negate the anime as a whole. I like how Akio tends to be a white shirt and jeans kind of guy, and the way he&amp;rsquo;s drawn, it&amp;rsquo;s like he&amp;rsquo;s an anime version of James Dean himself. Hell, he&amp;rsquo;ll even wear the red jacket like he does on the cover of Rebel Without a Cause.<br />
<br />
The races are also in CG, though it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really look as cel shaded as 4th Stage, but the style accurately portrays the features of the cars, and the corresponding engine sounds. The buildings and the Wangan are also rendered in CG as if it were the PS3 or arcade game. The cars presented are also a nice flavor (I get the notion that the original manga-ka is a Nissan fan and loves the GT-R), and the racing brings a different kind of suspense such as a danger risk and the portrayal of the consequences of reckless driving. Such consequences are wrecks and even engine blowouts, which gives it a sense of limitation to the cars. Initial D has that risk factor, but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel it, but I do feel it with Wangan Midnight, which makes the races more edge at your seat. Plus, I felt Initial D&amp;rsquo;s world despite praising it for it&amp;rsquo;s realism, in comparison to Wangan Midnight, it way too idealistic. But the races are more one-dimensional because it mostly takes place on the Wangan, and the style of racing itself to some people doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel as exciting as drifts or as innovating as gutter gripping on hairpins. But outside of the risk factor of driving at 300km/h on a public highway, the only other contributing factor to excitement is that races can be at 4 cars at once while it&amp;rsquo;s not exclusive to two cars. But the fact they push it to the limit should be exciting enough for some people. Now that I think about it, why aren&amp;rsquo;t their cops out there after them? I wonder if it&amp;rsquo;s true according to Tokyo Drift that cops in Japan can&amp;rsquo;t catch you if you&amp;rsquo;re exceeding 180 km/h. <br />
<br />
The voice cast is excellent though there is one big name that stands out to me that took some adjusting, and that was Miki Shin&amp;rsquo;ichiro the voice of Takumi in Initial D, as the voice of Shima. I&amp;rsquo;m so used to hearing him as Takumi to a point that I really couldn&amp;rsquo;t imagine him in this role. By the time I got to the end, I finally accepted him as Shima and started to appreciate his performance And I felt it was unique that they casted J-Drama actor, Oguri Shun, who was in the live action versions of GTO, Gokusen, and Hana Yori Dango as Akio. I thought he captured Akio&amp;rsquo;s characteristics in a typical fashion where you&amp;rsquo;re convinced he&amp;rsquo;s a unique kind of teenager and shows great variety to Oguri&amp;rsquo;s acting abilities in this approach. I also liked Suhou Reiko as Reina. I thought she did great as a seiyuu by being a down to earth idol. And I was most impressed with Miyake Kenta&amp;rsquo;s performance as Kitami Jun, the tuner from hell. You probably know him as Tsume from Wolf&amp;rsquo;s Rain, Vetor in Sonic, and is also casted as Zangief in SFIV. Anyway, I think he brings a unique charisma and intimidation to the character where he can freak you out to a point that yeah, he tunes crazy cars, but hey it&amp;rsquo;s probably worth the risk. So he swept me off my feet.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there is no Eurobeat. Music isn&amp;rsquo;t really that emphasized in this anime. The track you&amp;rsquo;ll tend to hear is a more techno driven Eastern Indian song that sounds similar to what you hear in Ghost in the Shell. It suits that risk factor that this anime has, but gets overused and we also have extreme techno rock every now and then. The opening and the ending themes do sound like MOVE&amp;rsquo;s songs, but they are more upbeat and up lifting, and not as emphatically hip hop driven, nor do they comes across as extreme as MOVE, but likable. <br />
<br />
Like Initial D and some other anime I review, Wangan Midnight is for people who want to try something different, but it&amp;rsquo;s still an anime that isn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone whether you&amp;rsquo;re new to anime or hardcore. Granted you can say that about DBZ, Lucky Star, and EVA, but Wangan Midnight is just a different tune to truly apply that because its racing, people will jump to conclusions that it&amp;rsquo;s stupid just because of what it&amp;rsquo;s about. In some aspects, I think Wangan Midnight has distinguishing qualities that keeps me interested, such as the character exploration and the realism, and I love the arcade game. But hey, growing up with a father who loves cars and going to school with people who love to drag race, I could get into this anime and I had familiarity with the arcade game, Maximum Tune which should be at your local arcade. Give it a try, it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
I doubt this anime is getting licensed, so you can go to your usual torrent sources to get it. And remember: this review is a review of a work of fiction and I encourage you to please drive safely and obey traffic laws at all times, and stick to racing at your local arcade, gaming console or public circuit track.

    In the beginning I wondered if the star car was going to be possessed ala Stephen King&#039;s Christine, and although that question was never exactly answered, that is not the direction the story took.  Wangan is a heartfelt look at street, rather freeway, racing, the people caught in the lifestyle and the cars that obsess them.  At times it is almost a tutorial on how to rebuild an engine. <br />
<br />
For one reason and another, I&#039;ve not finished Initial D so I&#039;m not going to make any kind of cross comparison other than saying Initial D didn&#039;t capture me the way Wangan Midnight did.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review24164">
         I dated car guys, handed them tools and torqued down timing chain covers . . . .until I broke a bolt or two . . . I drove fast cars and owned them myself.  Occasionally, I pretend my sedate Subaru Forester is really a WRX.  Consequently, Wangan Midnight spoke to me in a way that may not reach the typical anime fan.  <br />
<br />
Some folk feel the series is a little slow to reach take off.  I didn&#039;t notice.  I found plenty character development and white knuckle racing action.  I also liked the characters who came into the story for an episode or two and, as with the actual racing community, for one reason or another, went a different direction.  Some satisfied a need, others chose not to let the obsession rule their life, others devoted their life to the obsession, some with a positive out come, some not so much.    <br />
<br />
Interestingly, the primary protagonist, is given a James Dean style look, complete with a Rebel Without a Cause white t-shirt and red jacket.  The bad luck 240Z is also a reference to the Porsche 1950&#039;s actor Dean died in.  It is said that his Porsche is cursed.  Anyone trying to rebuild it our use its parts got into accidents of their own.  And so it is with the Devil Z in Wangan Midnight.<br />
<br />
I loved everything about the art except the facial designs of the characters, the females  in particular. Apparently, the choice was in deference to the manga it is based on, a manga that goes back to &#039;92, hence the dated look.  Soundtrack wise, the music is o.k. but the car sounds are great.  <br />
<br />
Ultimately, Wangan is about relationships; relationships between people and specific cars, between people who love cars, and between people who love the people who love the cars.  If you are even just a little bit of a car geek, make time for Wangan Midnight.

    Intro: Wangan Midnight is about a group of people that you wish were dead so they would stop putting innocent lives at risk. <br />
To make an objective comparison, even though I shouldn&#039;t, Initial D is better than Wangan Midnight in every aspect except animation.<br />
While both series are about cars and racing, Wangan Midnight is about speed/power and Initial D is about drifting/driving skills.<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
The story revolves around the young &quot;racer&quot; Akio who becomes the owner of a great car named Devil&#039;s Z. This car due to its tragic history is considered cursed and a &quot;living machine&quot; that chooses it&#039;s driver.<br />
The story is boring and childish,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240295">
        with one dimensional races that mostly take place between noob drivers on the Wangan. <br />
The story is more about tuning cars rather than driving skills and driving techniques. These &quot;racers&quot; have no skills other than very deep pockets to buy diffrent &quot;special&quot; parts to upgrade their cars thus the series becomes about who has the more powerful car rather than who is the more skilled driver.<br />
The plot has multiple holes and flaws such as the pacing, which is pretty bad.<br />
<br />
Some of the plot holes and flaws I found:<br />
1. Why are there no cops on the highway that is known for being the spot where illigal races take place?<br />
2. If the &quot;Devil Z&quot; is cursed and only accepts Akio as it&#039;s driver, how come 5 other people drove it just fine?<br />
3. Why would Akio let an inexperienced tunner work on his Z?<br />
4. Why are those trucks going so fast?<br />
5. The pacing is just bad.<br />
6. How come a car that burned down and got in multiple high speed crashes can be repaired?<br />
7. Apparently no one is bothered by dumb ass noobs going at more that 300km/h on populated public roads. <br />
8. The anime keeps showing Reina&#039;s feelings about Akio but never delivers the ending.<br />
9. In Initial D the goals of the street racers were to become professional racers, but what is the goal in this anime?<br />
<br />
Characters: 3/10<br />
The characters seem to be taken out of cartoons, they get almost no characterization or background story and no development whatsoever. <br />
These &quot;racers&quot; are random people with very little driving experience an no real skill that somehow got their hands on fast cars and decided it is best to race on public populated roads.<br />
<br />
Animation: 7/10<br />
The animation is decent and mostly fluid with decent CG. The overall quality of the animation is nothing special or memorable.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
The opening theme is decent but the ending theme is pretty bad. The show dosen&#039;t have much background music and what music it has is not very good or engaging.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
This was not an entertaining series, with poor characters and bad plot as well as races that are boring and don&#039;t show anything interesting or exciteing, I found it difficult to finish this series.<br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10<br />
Wangan Midnight is a mediocre series, it excels at nothing and it is not intriguing. Even if you really want a cars/racing anime this series is barely worth watching, I would not recommend it.

    The &quot;other&quot; racing anime, following the enormously popular Initial D.<br />
<br />
There is a MASSIVE contingent of the anime-watching car community that has seen this anime up to episode eight. At that point, it pretty much seems to be a cycle of Akio crashing the Z and spending long hours fixing it up again, and it&#039;s very easy to quit. I did it myself once, but going back I found that the series comes into its own after that point, producing a truly excellent series about the lives of car enthusiasts. It doesn&#039;t hurt that the racing and tuning picks up substantially then, too.<br />
<br />
Half the point of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review54153">
        Wangan Midnight seems to be the way the characters are willing to sacrifice their lives, families, and careers for the sake of an ultimately pointless hobby; the series opens with Akio about to drop out of school because of his weak Z31. The emphasis on characters in this series also means that you care quite a bit more about them throwing everything away than you do when, say, a minor character in Initial D begs his girlfriend for money.<br />
<br />
But if that&#039;s half the point, the other half is what they&#039;re willing to sacrifice all that for. This show portrays a whole string of passionate tuners with elaborate backstories about turning wrenches on classic Japanese iron, and even more drivers with an all-consuming thirst for speed. The question of whether the Devil Z has a soul or will of its own hangs in the air clean through the series, but watching Akio develop a relationship with it may be one of the finest depictions of what a sports car means to its driver. Every shot of every racing sequence is pure car porn, which just drives the point home even more.<br />
<br />
The racing action is more subtle than Initial D, and is much more concerned with the mechanical aspects of the cars rather than purely with the driving. The soundtrack follows suit, switching from Initial D&#039;s manic eurobeat to some kind of orchestral thing, which I think has its own charms.<br />
<br />
The art didn&#039;t generate any complaints out of me, since I spent my formative years watching Speed Racer dubs and Initial D&#039;s horrifyingly-animated First Stage. Someone with a more discerning eye- and more familiar with current animation- may take slight issue. I don&#039;t really know.<br />
<br />
Sound was excellent. Period. The cars sound great, the soundtrack is moody and awesome, and you don&#039;t watch a car show for the voices, but these were pretty good.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a truly great anime for the serious-minded car enthusiast, and I regard it as being on par with such classic car films as &quot;Le Mans&quot; or &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;. It takes its technical background seriously and then puts a bunch of great people around a bunch of really fast cars.<br />
<br />
PS- No, no one&#039;s making 600rwhp on 3,100cc without fuel injection or cross-flow heads. I don&#039;t care how many scars your tuner has on his face.

    Ok then. I am gonna start saying that &quot;Wangan midnight&quot; isint just a dumb car anime, like people think. <br />
Wangan for who dont know is basicaly highways in japan, who are famous beacause its the stage of A LOT of ilegal races. <br />
Most of the people want to compare wangan to Initial D ... and belive me, its a huge mistake. <br />
Initial is about drifting, but wangan abord races in high speed ... like 300km ( curiosity ... 300km its the dream of all wangan racers )    <br />
But ok ... lets talk about the anime. <br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
Like i said before, wangan its a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218384">
        highway, and the anime explores it ... in the best way possible.<br />
The races are to good, and with de OST in the back give such emotion that i can describe in words. <br />
The characters .... hmm, they are pretty ok. <br />
the protagonist ( Asakura Akio ) its the best in there so far, beacause his love for the Z ( car that he drives in the series ) its so big, that he can easily die driving.<br />
The Z has a problem tho ... but, u has see the anime to understand that.<br />
<br />
So its over ... the hating in overall is : 9 <br />
i had pretty much fun watching ( and reading a little bit of the manga ), and for a huge car fan ... its more than valid give it a try.<br />

    Wangan Midnight is a must watch and play (for the videogames and Tokyo Xtreme Racer series games) for anyone who&#039;s into car culture or into the old Shutokou battles that still happen to this day.<br />
The story lacks a lot in comparison to both the manga and games, as it jumps a lot of arc, the pacing is quite bumpy as characters or even races just happens out of nowhere, being so noticeable as (SPOILER) one of the main racers at the final race just appearing 2 episodes before and be inclueded because Yes. The ending was super lack lusting as it gave no conclusion to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317668">
        no points and being as rushed as to give us short lined realisations and a Haikai about the car.<br />
The art is very good for someone who enjoys car culture, as many cars are built with real world parts and are aesthetically pleasing. The characters have a good design as well being truthfull to real life dressing, especially when it comes to driving clothings and tuner suits.<br />
The sounds are nice but kind of bland sometimes as an R32 or R33 dont sound like the RB26 engines, meanwhile the Evo 6 from Eiji does sound like an 4G63. The OST is godly as it has a mix of breakbeat, jazz and pop for the races, while also having orchestral for more thoughtfull moments. Not only that but the Intro is peak eurobeat perfection!<br />
The characters are pretty well acted, having as remarkables Akio, Eiji and Jun. Some can feel kind of bland but it&#039;s because most of them are pretty serious about anything.<br />
Overall it&#039;s a good show, but i recommend playing the games or reading the manga for further details and enjoyement. The reason why as to Wangan Midnight having so little episodes is because Genki didn&#039;t have much money at the time to fund the rest of the anime, so they had to go for a one shot. But again, it&#039;s a must watch for anyone into car culture!

    TLDR Review - one point is removed for each negative aspect.<br />
<br />
Story (-1) : even though street racing genre is self-explainatory, the same formula of tune/fix and race again becomes boring when it occurs for the 3rd time (and more to come)<br />
<br />
Side characters (-1) : every 5 or so episodes, 2-3 supporting characters get replaced with new ones, with almost nothing but personal background being different.<br />
<br />
Races (-1) : police is nowhere to be seen, other traffic drivers act like props, neither road nor weather conditions don&#039;t change. Races end within seconds with one driver letting go of the throttle when facing personal contradiction for a moment

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308410">
        - or if something breaks. Winning the race seems neither rewarding nor interesting. <br />
<br />
Plot holes (-1) : Devil Z (the cover cars) &quot;curse&quot; on the main protagonist (with which the whole story is based upon) is negated by supporting characters, descriptions of crashes don&#039;t make sense when the show is trying to be realistic and relationship between main protagonist and his love interest (actually its the other way around) remain unresolved.<br />
<br />
Ending (-1) : show ends with no conclusion after the final race, with it being nearly identical with other ones on the show.

    Wangan Midnight is a very good anime considering there are barely any animes out there that is about japanese street racing (apart from Initial D).<br />
<br />
Wangan Midnight is about expressway racing on the so called &quot;Wangan&quot; (Shutoko Expressway, Japan&#039;s longest and straightest roads used for traveling around in central Japan) at very high speeds up to the point when the body of the car literally folds because of the high air resistance, one of the consequences of going over 300KM/H in a street-legal car.<br />
<br />
I personally think that this is by far one of the best racing animes ever, it is of course tied with Initial D.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review348090">
        I prefer the Wangan Midnight&#039;s art design over the Initial D one every day, that goes for the sound effects aswell (not music). But I think that the Initial D story is way better than Wangan Midnight, it&#039;s way longer and the ending is much more acceptable.<br />
<br />
There is however not a dubbed version of Wangan Midnight which is kind of a bummer but still, there&#039;s no need. As Miki Shinichiro (voice actor of Takumi from Initial D) is voicing the character Tatsuya (Blackbird) which I just find comical since he is voicing the 2 of my top favourite racing animes.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t wait for similar anime&#039;s in the future, regular seinen slice of life stories with characters intrigued by the art of street racing. This is definitely one of the hidden anime gems, if you like cars then there&#039;s no excuse for you to not watch this.

    Ok so I am not going to write a whole essay about this anime because I wouldn&#039;t read it and I assume neither do you.<br />
<br />
I want to start this &quot;review&quot; talking about a misconception about this series. <br />
<br />
I saw a lot of people on the internet comparing this anime to Initial D, I mean, they&#039;re not wrong, both are about cars and take place in Japan...and there is where the similarities stop. Both anime show a different part of the car community in the 80-90&#039;s Japan. Initial D is very good at portraing the beginning of the drifting community while Wangan Midnight is very good

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325931">
        at portraing another piece of the japanese history.<br />
<br />
The whole plot of this anime is based on a bigger story, that of the Mid Night Club, an outlaw group of racers that used to race on the Bayshore Route in Japan, known as &quot;Wangan&quot;, hence the name of the anime, and they did a pretty good job. Knowing both stories and rewatching the series I could understand more what meant to live in that time and do what they were doing. <br />
<br />
During those 26 episodes you are presented with the thrill of the race, the consequence of being reckless and with the mentaining, repairing and improving your vehicle in order to be able to achieve those speeds (&gt;300km/h). I enjoyed every fact about the cars, their engines and the methods they used to push their limits to the max. <br />
<br />
The Z that could think on its own, trying to kill his owner is a bit unrealist but they did a very good job at creating their own hero car and giving some kind of aura. I still have goosebumps listening to the &quot;Voice of the Z&quot;.<br />
<br />
The whole story is a bit wacky but the whole conflict between the main character, Akio and his rival Blackbird (a refference to the Yoshida Specials 930) really spices things up. What was a form of relaxation for both of them turns into a race to see who is the best and this drives most of the story, going into the history of them and their cars.<br />
<br />
Finally, I want to adress some things pointed out by other users:<br />
-Characters have no backstory/are dull. &gt; Since the story is based on the races rather than the character development some characters aren&#039;t that interesting over time. Regarding the backstory problem. What did Dominic Toretto ask Brian O&#039;Conner before they raced? Not even his name.<br />
<br />
-Why there aren&#039;t any cops during the races? &gt;The whole story is based on Mid Night Club&#039;s story which happened between 1985 and 1999 police cars and stock cars had their top speed limited to 180km/h. Maybe there were cops, but way too slow for us to see them.<br />
<br />
It ain&#039;t much, but it&#039;s honest work.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    As a car guy who both love cars and watch anime, this is probably the most realistic a car anime could get. I&#039;m probably gonna get a lot of hate towards this, but I would definitely watch this over Initial D any day, and I love Initial D. The determining factor? <br />
<br />
Realism.<br />
<br />
Without giving too many spoilers, the story is about a young boy named Akio Asakura. One night, him and his friend were out on the Wangan Highway with two girls when suddenly, a black Porsche pulls up from behind and completely leaves him in the dust. Baffled by how fast the car was going,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303150">
        he tried to keep up the pace and tried to race the Porsche. Little did he know, he found out that the black Porsche was titled the &quot;King of Wangan&quot;. <br />
<br />
We follow through Akio&#039;s life as he finds an S30 (240z) in the junkyard and immediately falling in love with it. though there was one downside about the car. Disregarding everyone&#039;s warnings of not rebuilding the car, Akio realizes what a devil of the car was, thus rebirthing &quot;Devil Z&quot;.<br />
<br />
The characters in this anime were overall very amusing and fun to watch, as everyone seems to be fascinated by this demon of a car. Since everyone&#039;s so interested by the car, we also get to see the reasoning behind their fascination of the car, and all the characters just end up being very tight-knit to Akio. <br />
<br />
In the beginning of this review, I said that I would get a lot of hate for writing this due to the fact that I preferred this over Initial D, but let me explain. Though some people would argue and say that the two anime are very different, with one being revolved around drifting and this anime revolving around speed and tuning cars. That&#039;s why I like it so much. It not only shows racing culture at a premature-mature level, it also showcases tuning culture and having/wanting the need to go fast to outrun the opponent on what seems to be a never ending highway. Initial D just seemed too unrealistic for me as it felt like Takumi had some bullshit wins along the way. Takumi being undefeated, or almost undefeated, just makes it seem that there was no realism involved behind the show. It was always get into a downhill/uphill battle, and win. Simple as that. But in Wangan Midnight, their strong point was that when somebody knew they couldn&#039;t keep up, they would tune their cars and try to reach their dream goal of roaring through the highways at 300km/h, and thats where it got me.<br />
<br />
Sidenote: If you ever have a chance, go through your local arcade or mini golf place and try to look for this game. This game is absolutely fantastic, and such a fun game to play, as racing with your friends at 300km/h in Japan seems like a never-ending time of joy. I&#039;ve spent at least damn over $100 for a car card in this game, and I hold 3 maxed out cars (R32, AE86, and RX7 for anybody wondering. Probably not).<br />
<br />
Hope this review helped! If you have any doubts, just give it a shot. If you enjoy the tuner/racing culture, you&#039;ll definitely enjoy this anime.

    I think this is one of the few anime that I literally had to put down because I couldn&#039;t bear watching it anymore. Wangan Midnight probably draws in a lot of viewers from initial D (no surprise, that&#039;s how I found it too) but even if you try to consciously keep that comparison out of your mind and judge this without bias, it&#039;s just a bad show (I won&#039;t be discussing the manga here but the manga is *way* better). The plot itself, while kinda cheesy, is mildly interesting: A kid finds a car, the &quot;Devil Z&quot;, that&#039;s possessed by some spirit that lets it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377579">
        win every race it takes, but it eventually ends up killing its driver. It&#039;s your typical &quot;op mc that can never lose&quot; trope, except it&#039;s canon. <br />
<br />
My main issue with the series though, is that the characters are *awful*. Like really really really bad. A character with absolutely no connection to the story will be introduced with some half baked backstory, they suddenly become relevant to the mc because they &quot;heard of the car and want to race him&quot;. They show up, lose as expected, then disappear. And this happens over the span of literally one or two episodes. Almost half the series is just this, a rando showing up and getting floored before vanishing into the abyss again. There were times when it got so bad I went to double check that I hadn&#039;t skipped an episode, only to realize it was just the pacing being that terrible. As for the characters that stick around for a decent stretch, most of them are fairly shallow and don&#039;t have much in the sense of personality anyway. I did like Reina though, a fashion model who drives after work to unwind and get away from the stress of her public life, who then encounters the Devil Z and develops a passion for racing.<br />
<br />
The opening and ending are ok, don&#039;t really think it fits the vibe of the series that well but they&#039;re still pretty nice tracks. Main issue with music is that there&#039;s none during the races, which kinda makes some of the dialogue free action shots seem a bit odd because for a second you&#039;ll just be hearing two cars humming along at redline. One thing I will give props for, the animation is actually pretty nice. Looks very much like Initial D&#039;s fourth and fifth stages. It&#039;s not jaw dropping eyecandy, but the overall aesthetic feels juuust right to sell that night time street racer vibe, without coming off as a need for speed most wanted set in japan.<br />
<br />
Honestly all I can say is go read the manga, then if you like it watch the anime for the visuals. As a standalone, this series sucks and it might ruin your entire impression of the Wangan Midnight universe if this is the first taste you get.

    It&#039;s not your typical Initial D anime, if you think about it. However, when it comes to popularity, it was heavily overshadowed by it, but Wangan Midnight is still one of the rarest gems you should try to watch out for.<br />
<br />
Wangan Midnight is the Street Racing equivalent of Initial D without Eurobeat. And unlike Initial D, it was not set on a canyons and mountains across Japan, but only from the real-life Bayshore Route of Shouto Expressway (also known as the &quot;Wangan-sen&quot;) and on the latter episodes, in Osaka.<br />
<br />
Also, the cars that represented here are not just Japan-made, but also some came from Europe as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301109">
        well. From a Ferrari Testarossa (which is very rare given that Ferrari is very strict to use rights of their cars for entertainment purposes) to the Porsche 930, better known as the &quot;Blackbird&quot; and as the rival of the Protagonist&#039;s Nissan Fairlady Z, also known as the &quot;Devil Z&quot; in both the manga and the anime.<br />
<br />
So, as much as how positive the manga is, the adaptation, however, is not excellent or great as how Initial D executed. Even without the Initial D mentioning in this review.<br />
<br />
(SPOILERS on the Story)<br />
The story starts up to the protagonist, Akio Akiyama, who is a Senior High School as he is about to graduate only to repeat a grade due to his outstanding absences, even though his grade is good enough to move on to college. But as humble and gentle as he can be, he still shows his delinquent side of him by not going to school, even though he was been told by a teacher that he should go back or else, he&#039;s going to take another year again in High School. But he does not concern it as he do some part time in a local bar and he tends to do street racing more often after he bought the &quot;possessed&quot; Nissan Fairlady Z, best known for its&#039; moniker &quot;Devil Z&quot; known for its&#039; wicked power and handling,that few of its&#039; owners died because of it, one of which is the original owner of the Z, also named Akio Akayama, who is the rival of Tatsuya Shima, driver of the Porsche 911 Turbo/ when he was crashed during their race. But the present and non-related to the original owner, Akio did not stop there and continues to drive it until he get the hang of the car to control it. He also faced tons of characters, ranging from Nissan Skylines, to Mitsubishi Lancers, to even its&#039; rial, Tatsuya, and his Blackbird, to know who owns the &quot;King&quot; in Wangan Highway.<br />
(SPOILER END)<br />
<br />
The story is just focusing on one goal, to know who is the fastest on the Wangan Highway for both the rival (not to be confused, by the way, to the antagonist as there is actually no bad blood between them) and the protagonist, it&#039;s very plain and kind of anti-climactic. But if you are looking for some heart-wrenching backstories before the set of the race with a good yet expecting ending, then the other minor characters from the other episodes will try to tell their stories with some progress for the major characters in the story. With some major stories also from minor characters will reveal their intentions and relations to the Devil Z.<br />
<br />
The Art for the anime is what you expect to the 2007 - 2008 anime, except they make the characters look a little realistic from their hairstyles to their clothes as well. The cars and the races on the hand, is surprisingly, they tend not to use too much 3D CGI animation unlike... you guessed it, BERSER--, I mean, Initial D, which are well known on their PS1 to PS2-graphics Artstyle.<br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t like the OP and ED on this anime, then maybe you might like the Songs from their Car Engines whenever they installed their new turbos and modifications from the following episodes of this series. Because that&#039;s how I do feel about the OP and the ED as well. ED especially, but despite that I do have some love-hate relationship with the OP song, Lights and Any More, I felt kinda likable to the point that it felt too catchy to be likeable. It&#039;s like you hate the song, but later on, you start to like it a little until you just sing it out because who cares if you hate it though. The voice actors, one of which is Takumi VA, Shinichiro Miki, performed here in this anime is well-performed as well.<br />
<br />
The characters in this anime, is actually very immersive and realistic that tends to compliments to the watchers as well. There are some of the characters stopped racing before until they later start to race again and promised that this will be their last time in exchange of the trust and promise related to the other characters after encountering the Devil Z, A character left to his respective racing group in order to chase his dream and defeat the Z on his own, the group would follow suit and also try to defeat the Z, a retired racer who later then encounter and heard the Devil Z and try to defeat him and others. I&#039;ve already mentioned on the Story part of this review that they have different storylines but they are all connected and wanted to defeat the Devil Z. And for those who did not watched the anime yet, who do you think are the individuals that finally defeated the Z? Who are the victims that was loss against the Z? And yes, Z was defeated in this anime and there is no &quot;Takumi Complex&quot; from Initial D where the opponent wins until some miracle s*** happens to the opponent causing Takumi to get the win by default. Annoying isn&#039;t it? Maybe it was one of the protagonist&#039;s notorious cliche in animes. So... yeah. So don&#039;t expect Akio will suddenly win because SOMEONE THEN PUKE N THE MIDDLE OF THE RACE AND DECIDED TO TAKE HIS W BECAUSE THE AUTHOR OF THAT &quot;MANGA&quot; SAYS SO. I&#039;M TALKING TO YOU &quot;GOD HAND&quot; AND SHUICHI SHIGENO. Weak b*astards. But I still love you, Initial D.<br />
<br />
The fact is, this anime has some deep poetry that talks about the personality and the philosophy of cars like on Initial D. But unlike the latter, it has more dedication and understanding more in their cars than what they have in their lives. Yeah, it&#039;s deep. It&#039;s not just they talk on how fast their car was and talks about the specific specification used. But also on how the cars feel and the relationship between the driver and the car as well. Also, the battle climax is great as well with the help of the character&#039;s dialogue that tells about how they are doing and the cars they&#039;ve using might have a lot of effects on it similar to how Initial D depicted. But unlike Initial D, the music used are the OST made for this anime. But it&#039;s not that bad, ranging from latin orchestra with some heavy-rock composition and it&#039;s piano composition which sounds like it was came from a horror film.<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime is really recommendable to watch. It might sound boring at the first few episodes, but expect something very interesting at the following episodes to come. My cousin even liked this anime after for about few weeks after I recommended this anime to him since he is playing also the Wangan Midnight games in the arcade near us. So when he watched, he liked it... until the final episode shows up and it&#039;s ending. Whcih is skeptical.

    On-hold after 10 episodes after I had a hard times recognizing the characters (which some of them almost looks identical) that led me to a confusing understanding what happened after the protagonist had his second crash that completely wrecked the Devil Z.<br />
<br />
But since it&#039;s an anime that revolves around cars, I&#039;m pretty sure anyone who need a review about this anime will ask &quot;is it &#039;as good as&#039; Initial D, or even better?&quot;. And, here&#039;s my review:<br />
<br />
Personally, I hate Initial D. It&#039;s pathetic because it already have tons of BS, plotholes and false logics in a span of only the first five episodes. But 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290323">
        I haven&#039;t seen something similar as far as my concentration goes analyzing everything shown in Wangan Midnight. This is the reason why I gave Initial D a 2/10 score but 7/10 for Wangan Midnight.<br />
<br />
For me, Wangan Midnight story and characters makes more sense than what you&#039;d found in Initial D. The protagonist is that kind of kid who literally careless about school so he always skipped class to work on a part-time to get more money to buy parts for his car, he even almost dropped out of school since he&#039;s always absent. The rival is a surgeon doctor that is also a car enthusiasts who loves to drive in his free time in the night. Other character are an ex-mechanic+racer that really gifted on car tuning (you know, someone like Jack Brabham or Bruce McLaren in F1), there&#039;s also a female test driver works in television industry joined the wangan night rides, businessman ferrari-owner ojiisan, etc. I mean, these characters literally do something to makes tuned their cars better, they didn&#039;t got the cars or money out of nowhere (like what happen in the Initial D, he only sells tofu but burning tyres will cost him more than the profit from the tofu). The always-skipping-class protagonist is also almost dropped out of his school because of that. The races are also still kept inside the real life physics like when the Devil Z have so much power that makes it easily lose traction and aways ended up wrecked condition (unlike tons of impossible moves by the underpowered 86 beating every superior cars in Initial D).<br />
<br />
But if you like something like &#039;cool moves&#039; more than &#039;realisms&#039;, Wangan Midnight is definitely not for you tho.<br />
<br />
Objectively, even if both anime are about cars, they&#039;re actually serve a completely different theme. Initial D is focused on racing (uhh, come on, honestly drifting is not racing) while Wangan Midnight focused on tuning. Initial D have twisted road in the mountains while Wangan Midnight have highways. <br />
<br />
But something that is better in Initial D is how the story goes, it&#039;s much more easier to follow and understand.
