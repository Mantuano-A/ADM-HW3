    Somehow the high expectations I had awaiting the sequel to a fantastic series were not fulfilled. Ryuusei No Gemini isn’t exactly a sequel to Kuro no Keiyakusha, but more like a separate arc in itself. It would be unfair to compare both of them as they vary in their style and storyline. For starters, the series are not bi-episodic; instead revolve around a single storyline involving a Eurasian female protagonist. Hei’s involvement through the series although significant, has not really been up to what it ought to be.  <br />
<br />
Storyline: 7/10<br />
Suou Pavlichenko is a 13 year Eurasian girl whose life suddenly changes on a fateful

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23396">
        day when she meets up with Hei. Involved in the mess of politics and war between the contractors, she seeks out on her own quest to find her missing twin, Shion. Alongside her is Hei, a drunk bastard who completely lacks the mannerism and politeness he once had. The personality change might have been necessary in this series as it made things a bit interesting, but it didn’t seem all that good seeing him like that. The storyline, in its individuality served to be interesting though. The protagonist goes through a lot of ordeals throughout her journey. The series also has some graphic and violent killings which made it a little gory at times. The birth and evolution of the contractors was something we had vaguely seen in Kuro no Keiyakusha. The involvement of many groups (CIA, FSB, MI6 and Section 3) could have made for better viewing had they had more air time. They left it a bit incomplete and it felt as if these names were only included to attract attention without proper motive behind it. Also the “Syndicate” that pretty much ruled in Kuro no Keiyakusha was nowhere to be seen, again a disappointment as the whole mysteriousness behind them suddenly disappeared. Altogether though, despite its shortcomings it was somehow good how it ended up being. I guess it may be due to the protagonists’ whole journey from havoc to happiness. As for the name “Gemini of the Meteor”, it wasn’t nearly as important to be kept in the title IMO. <br />
<br />
Characterization: 7/10<br />
Ryuusei No Gemini had a plethora of characters which made it quite an entertaining prospect to watch. Starting off with Suou, a determined and strong girl entwined between living a life as a human or a contractor. It was touching to see the ordeals she and her school friends went through. Much like a supporting character, July was an example of some nice character development, and his relation with Suou was charming to watch. Hei’s laid-back sake drinking attitude failed to impress me the slightest. And the fact that he was not able to showcase his powers during most of the series made it lamer for me. The agents of Section 3 were pretty good, namely Hizaki and Genma. Hizaki’s remuneration involved kissing someone after the usage of her power added to the humor. Madam Oreille was yet promising character shown but somehow failed to make much of an impact in the Anime. Lot of interesting characters I would say. But somehow they were cramped up in a short series which somehow failed them I believe. They should have been given more time for their characters to be known properly rather than just through some cameo roles.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
The original characters were already pretty awesome in how they were made. The new characters were also very nicely put out. From the Russians to the CIA to the Japanese characters, all looked very original. Also the new characters gave the storyline a refreshing experience. The fights were well coordinated and typically good to watch. Hei’s new look was intriguing; Suou’s character was pretty nicely done too. The agents looked good and the whole background of the Anime from Russia to Tokyo was beautiful. The characters are all very nicely drawn and the animation stands out to be pretty good as well.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Sound was another good factor for Ryuusei No Gemini. The OP was a treat to the ears. I particularly liked it. The voices of the characters were also very good. Suou sounded very sweet whenever she used to shout “Tanya”. As there was a mixture of cultures, it’ll be interesting to see how these voices correlate in the dubs that will be out later on. The ED was average I would say. The best thing however would be the background score during the fights. The whole beat-box thing or whatever that was being played surely pepped up the interest to watch. I loved it. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
Seeing this series individually without comparing to the previous one and you’ll find that it’s actually good. Although not as epic as Kuro no Keiyakusha, Ryuusei No Gemini offers an entertaining experience with some interesting character portrayals. Combined with good artwork and sound, it is a definite recommendation. Just don’t try and compare it with the first season and you’ll definitely like it. <br />

    I had a rather a hard time wrapping my head around the thought process taken up by the scriptwriters of this show. They had an almost infinite pool of ideas to work with, from the origin story and reasoning behind the Hell&#039;s Gate manifestation to endless detours that could have been taken up using the Contractors and Dolls as parables for sociological issues plaguing current society; the possibilities were endless. It seemed that with all the mysterious themes being left in a shroud of ambiguity and the multifaceted approaches to tackling them just on the cusp of being explored, any route could have been taken

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181949">
        that would have resulted in a decent sequel. Taking a shot in the dark with any one of these ideas should have yielded something worthwhile. But for reasons beyond comprehension, instead of trying to provide a solid answer to its mysteries or even using it to flesh out its world&#039;s lore, they threw that all away. And for what you may ask? Well, lolis, forced comedy, talking squirrels, character resets, raging alcoholics and a sleuth of more idiotic plot twists.<br />
<br />
Still wondering why and how the Heaven/Hell Gates appeared? Still wondering why they brought on an augmented sky that warped into the new one? Still wondering why contractors and dolls became a product of this? Still wondering why their lives are correlated with fallen stars? Still wondering what the motivation of the syndicate was? Still trying to decipher this show&#039;s bullshit?... Well, join the club. In this second season, the writers said &quot;fuck it&quot; once again, as they followed up the events of the first by managing to create something that felt terribly dated from the moment it rolled off the assembly line. It&#039;s a husk of the show&#039;s former self in every regard. The story, despite being more streamlined this time around, was still very uneventful. All it does was drag us along to a nonsense-filled finale that will likely leave all its mysteries and hackneyed bullshit permanently unanswered. It&#039;s the kind of narrative structure when the intent felt like reverse-engineering gone wrong. This is studio Bones after all. A studio that&#039;s become infamous for thrusting their own concepts up their asses. <br />
<br />
The 1st season of DTB went from passable action romp to inflated pseudo-concepts by the final stretch of it. And as if that wasn&#039;t enough, now it felt like the staff gave up on having decent coherency among its pseudo-thematic jargon and settled for whatever came to mind instead. So this time around, even the pseudo-concepts don&#039;t make sense. Like a rough draft of a script passed along a circle of &quot;fuck its&quot; and shoulder shrugs, as they rake in the money, tossing what little ideas they had towards the finished product without so much as batting an eye. <br />
<br />
Speaking of tossing shit together, the art seemed to have become a victim of complacency as well. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know how this is possible, but with fewer episodes to worry about and more years to perfect the art style, the 2nd season felt like it brought no visual improvements to the table. By a side by side comparison, very little was made better, instead, a 2-year gap in its production cycle seemed to have left it in a state of stagnation. It&#039;s like the animator team made it back in &#039;07 and just let it gather up dust until it was time to release it. And when placed against other titles made in the same year, it just pales in comparison. And this isn&#039;t to say that studio Bones couldn&#039;t do any better. They&#039;ve already proven that they could improve their visual and animation efforts as time goes on. Just looking at the visual output between Eureka Seven&#039;s 1st and 2nd season shows that. So seeing how little they cared about improving their craft for DTB&#039;s sequel felt like a cheap blow. It&#039;s a mediocre patch-job that doesn&#039;t deserve any credit whatsoever.<br />
<br />
And while I can&#039;t offer it much credit, an aspect of this season that might register with some was the new choice of music. <br />
<br />
The great jazz/blues fusion soundtrack of season one took a backseat to a more contemporary House-electronic sound. It&#039;s not a bad soundtrack but when compared to the prequel&#039;s, it feels out of place. It inadvertently strips the show of its familiar charm and alienates it further from its predecessor. The neo-noir backdrop feels out of place when the smoky croon of a Jazz track is replaced by what&#039;s effectively a rave-party anthem. It simply sucks the atmosphere out and replaces it with something more &quot;in the now&quot; as opposed to the timeless feeling. Since musical taste is subjective, I won&#039;t harp on it any further and leave you to decide where you stand on it. <br />
<br />
But what isn&#039;t a decision that needs much debating over was the new cast. <br />
<br />
With fewer contractors, more people characters in their place, there&#039;s still no decent characterization to be found. They made a big deal about contractors having no irrational emotion in season one but there&#039;s very little differentiating them from other people when they all remain one-note. Also, that sense of maturity that the first season carried for its characters was thrown out the window and replaced with bombastically over-the-top eccentricities. This causes a HUGE tonal shift in how the show is presented and perceived. Similarly to what the switch in musical tones did, this too was a decision that watered down the poignancy that occasionally flicked through in season one. Now, everything was glaringly carefree. They even changed the classy cat to a flying squirrel. LIKE SERIOUSLY? FUCK YOU DTB!<br />
<br />
The biggest issue comes with Suou, our new protagonist. She takes up more screen time than necessary and is only good for two things: being an inconsistent character that flip-flops from one tonal speed to the other, or loli fanservice. And if that wasn&#039;t bad enough, she was degraded to becoming a contrived plot-device halfway through the series.<br />
Hei isn&#039;t even the same badass we use to love. The writers added over-bloated angst to his characteristics and made a man who was already lacking in emotional range, to begin with, to be presented as a complete nut job of polarizing extremes. In place of the calm and collected demeanor he once had, we&#039;re instead given a raging alcoholic who slaps little girls in his spare time and drinks himself silly when he felt like it. Of course, he still kills contractors like the cool electric Batman we grew to love but his conflicting characteristics with his supposed &quot;emotionless state&quot; makes it harder for anyone to care for him anymore. He simply became a puppet of the poorly written screenplay, being inserted whenever the writers saw fit.<br />
<br />
But perhaps the worst replacement was that of the side characters introduced for this season. The cast included a tranny bartender with a lolicon obsessed son, Misaki the walking plot-device, antagonists that border on luny, and a sleuth of people that aren&#039;t worth the mention. Needless to say, the cast here was far inferior to the show&#039;s previous standards. They served no other purpose than being aggravating tagalongs that no one ever wanted. <br />
<br />
And really, this season itself was just that: an aggravating tagalong that we&#039;re forced to accept as a continuation. Instead of getting a decent successor, we&#039;re instead given a half-baked effort that couldn&#039;t stand on its own. Bones dropped the ball in every conceivable level. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/10<br />
<br />
Disappointment... I found nothing here but unsubstantial fights and cheap attempts at fanservice. This is NOT how you do a sequel to a neo-noir action romp. It doesn&#039;t even work as pure schlock entertainment. Apparently, even Pizza Hut said &quot;oh hell no, fuck that&quot; since they too were nowhere to be found, wanting nothing to do with this uninspired continuation.<br />
<br />
Overall: 3/10<br />
<br />
There are bad sequels then there&#039;s DTB&#039;s sequel. A sequel that literally scrubbed the show of its previous identity and STILL didn&#039;t answer any questions. As it is now, I can only recommend this to completionists. An underwhelming mess that sullied what little credentials the series was desperately clinging onto.

    I am &quot;a bit disappointed&quot; in the rest of the reviews here, namely that so many of them reflect that this season was dreadful, yet hedge that to &quot;being a bit disappointed&quot; with it. This season was balls to the walls, shamelessly awful.<br />
<br />
The defining feature of the entire series: how they manage to draw every character with dead eyes throughout the series, yet expect us to enjoy ourselves. The defining scene: horrible side character creation 1, dreadlock kids, sobbing and venting to horrible side character creation 2, his crossdressing dad, culminating in being more likely to make you laugh than cry as he sobs and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23570">
        whines into his cake. The defining question: how they expect us to believe Hei can still kick everyone in the world&#039;s ass with no powers and reduced to &quot;living the good life&quot; (that one was a minor meme joke, do not worry if you did not get it).<br />
<br />
There are already other reviews that detail exactly how the plot is (stupidly) aimless and bereft of basically most of the useful details it should have, so I am not going to rehash that. What I will touch on is how the plot is awful with the characters it uses: it introduces lots of new characters, all poor creations that are impossible to care about; it has a lot of short, impossibly one sided battles; it gives random annoying flashes to some apparently crazy event involving Yin, with absolutely no real explanation as to why they happened; it has random, annoying flashes to these blonde twin girls, who speak in tittery, annoying voices and &quot;say mysterious things&quot; i.e. nonsensoleum; it has cop lady chasing desperately after Li, despite the fact that she has no real insight to anything in this series, never does anything, and just wastes our time; it has former cool cat Mao back as an awful, ridiculously (poorly drawn) cartoony flying squirrel like creature (they called it a mamonga or something, whatever). Get the picture?<br />
<br />
This version of Darker Than Black just tries to establish how SAD and AWFUL everything is for everyone, and it definitely does a good job of showing viewers an awful time. Of course, just like people are unwilling to be objective about Code Geass 2 since they loved Code Geass 1, similarly no one will be objective about Darker Than Black 2 since they loved Darker Than Black 1. I cannot wait until the OVAs come out to &quot;connect the seasons&quot; and people act like it redeems all the flaws.

    I&#039;m not really one for writing long reviews of anime I&#039;ve watched, but I felt that I had to say something about this one.<br />
<br />
Darker than BLACK - Kuro no Keiyakusha had a dark storyline and characters with very distinct traits, especially Hei. Darker than BLACK - Ryuusei no Gemini, the sequel seemed to forget these.<br />
<br />
*Mild Spoilers Ahead*<br />
<br />
This anime would have been great if it was a stand-alone, but it was unlucky enough to have expectations to live up to its predecessor. The main character, Hei - once a calm, collected, cold-blooded killer now stars as an umkempt drunk who abducts small children and beats them.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22635">
        Mao, the cat who had previously died, is now a flying squirrel and stays as one even though he had many oppertunities to possess a cat. Yin has turned from a near-silent doll into a... wait, nothing at all was explained about that - but she made a lot of contractors commit suicide so that she could... that wasn&#039;t explained either. Kuro no Keiyakusha kept the plot a complete mystery until the end, but Ryuusei no Gemini didn&#039;t really explain it at all.<br />
<br />
So, our old friends from Kuro no Keiyakusha have had their characters changed drastically, but what about the new faces? Maybe they will make up for this? A loli with a rifle; a pervert who can turn into a golem and a lesbian with a lightsaber... personally, I didn&#039;t find them very original to say the least.<br />
<br />
Enough of bashing the characters though - onto the story. The series was half the length of Kuro no Keiyakusha, and the two episode long arcs were discarded. I was dissapointed by this since too many things weren&#039;t explained, even for Darker than BLACK. The last episode really needed to be two, maybe three, episodes and again explain a few more things. It was a cliffhanger disguised as closure.<br />
<br />
Overall, a decent anime. If you do plan on watching it, have Kuro no Keiyakusha ready to watch again so that you can get rid of the bad aftertaste - Ryuusei no Gemini doesn&#039;t live up to the original and makes you think less of some once great characters.

    Oh, Bones, Thank goodness you started DTB in the first place.<br />
THIS IS A REVIEW ON THE FIRST COUPLE EPISODES, AND I WILL UPDATE IT WHEN MORE EPISODES COME OUT.<br />
<br />
First off, DTB2 is NOT the original DTB. Bones have made some pretty big changes between seasons: setting main cast of characters, story, etc. It&#039;s better to look at DTB2 as more of a spin-off of the original DTB: if you liked season 1 because of the idea of the series (contractors et all), then you will most likely enjoy season 2. Now, onto the review:<br />
<br />
Story<br />
It is VERY different from the original DTB. First of all, it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19919">
        seems to be one continuous narrative instead of two-episode mini-arcs like in the original season. I happened to like the mini-arc format, but BONES obviously knows what they&#039;re doing: the story is as rich and detailed as ever. Like season 1, the story is centered around contractors, humans who have super powers but need a remuneration afterward. Instead of focussing on Hei, most of the spotlight is on Suou, a Russian/Japanese girl whose brother is a contractor.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
Some very big changes since season 1. Most notably is Hei&#039;s appearance: his mask is scratched, his coat is tattered, and he hasn&#039;t shaved in a while. In addition, the animation is sleeker, and the contractor&#039;s abilities are truly awe-worthy.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Like the first season, the sound is superb. The OP is definitely different, but in a good way, and the EP is one of my all time favorites.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
Hei takes a minor role so far in the series, which I actually prefer due to the ability to see more stellar characters. Suou is the focus of the series, and she is one of my favorite characters in all DtB, including 1st season Hei and Huang.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
Like always, DtB never ceases to surprise me. I absolutely love the new characters and contractors already introduced, and I expect there to be more as the series progresses. July, the MI6 doll in the first season, also seems to have a larger role than in season 1, which I think is awesome. And, like the first season, it is really fun to piece together each contractor&#039;s power and remuneration.

    Before you read this one, I would let you know that I am just a newbie when it comes to anime and I am not totally good when it comes to anime terms and words. Also I am not a good reviewer like the others in here. But, still I like to write a review for this and I will deliver it in a simple way based on my own opinions.<br />
<br />
Whats new in this series? A lot of changes. Yes a lot of changes, that would includes the characters, appearances, mood, settings and the story itself.<br />
What word might really fit in this series is the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review129925">
        word &quot;Explore&quot; yes, DTB-RNG really explored a lot in many aspects to make this series really great. Though it&#039;s just disappointing because it only has 12 episodes and there is no Season III for it unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Okay, here&#039;s my score for this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story 8/10 : This is quite different from the first season in terms of what is currently happening in the story, also you would never know that it is the continuation of the first season if you don&#039;t read the synopsis. In fact I can say that Ryuusei no Gemini can stand alone without watching the first season and probably reading the synopsis of this season is enough to understand what happened from the start. What I mean in here is DTB-RNG made some changes being able for the 2nd season to stand alone. But of course it has the linkage between season I and II which is really great, though there are some aspect of the stories that until now really intrigued me.<br />
<br />
Aside from that one of the greatest investment regarding in the story for this series is by adding some new faces on the story and where does the story takes place.<br />
<br />
Also the abilities of each contractor are really fun to watch this time since the other abilities from the previous season are common.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art 9/10 : Character&#039;s art were delivered very clear and they were matching according to their characteristics &amp; statistics. While some of the scenes out there are not properly delivered when it comes to art.<br />
But the X-factor of this when it comes to art is the adaptation of the country&#039;s dressing style and including it&#039;s culture and that&#039;s really impressive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10 : For a music lover like me, well this one is the 2nd highest basis for my criteria. Well, I can actually say that DTB-I has a great quality when it comes to SFX and other sound elements but, it&#039;s kinda lazy for ears. But, on this series it has been improved more than the previous season. Especially, if you will notice there are a lot of changes with Hei, not only with the personality but, also on how does he speak and reacts in different circumstances. Opening theme of Ryuusei No Gemini is really great, the music is titled &quot;Tsukiakari No Michishirube&quot; and it was performed by Stereopony a pop rock band in Okinawa that is already disbanded on 2012. What the most unique in here is Suou I like the way on how she deliver her words and reactions, perfectly matched with her characteristics and also the accent regards on their culture. One more thing regarding with the sound is the beat-box at the point where Hei showed himself and I was really surprised with his appearance, made me think &quot;Oh wow This is really cool!!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Character 9/10 : I am intrigue with the character changes in here especially Hei, a food lover that can probably always win with boodle fights turns into a drunk old looking guy also his polite personality disappeared and turns into a girl slapping guy with a black heart. While at some good point still, Suou Pavlichenko is the one that is totally unique and really, really good in the series. Character development for Suou is really good the way she speaks and the way she acts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8/10 : I can&#039;t say that I totally enjoyed this one especially it is all about syndicates and crimes so I am expecting a lot of actions unfortunately something happened. Since there is an unexpected event that can be added to the thrill that you&#039;ll need to find out to watch this series. Other than that, regarding in all aspects well I can say that you can really enjoy this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall 9/10 : I&#039;d rather say that I really enjoy this series and you might ending up wanting for this one to have a Season III.<br />
<br />

Note : This review never intend to please everybody so if you want to criticize this one you are actually welcome to do it and let me hear some words from you as I want to learn more.

    Please note that I just finished watching the last episode minutes ago and I&#039;m kinda trying to sort my thoughts out writing this.<br />
<br />
Darker than Black was never known to be the type of anime that explains everything, many things were and are left in the dark adding a whole layer of mystery to this fantastic world. Darker than Black 2 continues in this fashion but with quite a different approach. While the first season was mostly episodic, consisting of various story arcs with two episodes each, the second season is follows a continues storyline that is however developed quite well in my opinion. <br />
It might

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21702">
        seem a little bit cheese and typical in the beginning, but the story soon begins to ravel up and develop a bit of a darker feeling and the missing elements tying up to season 1 are also implemented, without however spellings things out to the viewer. There are always a few plot twists or single episodes that seem quite silly or pointless, but the greater story develops quite well. It is however not resolved completely and will likely continue into a third season in a similar fashion. I wonder whether we can ever hope for a complete unraveling of mystery, though I doubt it.<br />
<br />
The characters are very likeably and only partially reoccurring from the first season. The new characters might seem a bit unfitting at first but I like the way they develop. There is also a huge amount of character death, but in a different way compared to its prequel. The music and art continue in the fashion of season 1, the greatest controversy probably being the new opening and ending, though I personally liked them. The change of flavor is noticeable but not off putting.<br />
<br />
Also despite being a sequel it will probably also be very watchable for people who haven&#039;t seen the first season. The feeling is very similar but the direct links, despite being present, aren&#039;t major to the story.<br />
<br />
Darker than Black 2&#039;s greatest plus is probably it&#039;s enjoyment factor. The story, despite being interesting, is still not all that original and often a bit silly, but the atmosphere of the anime just keeps you glued to the back of your seat wanting to know what happens next and most importantly how it will play out. It may not be a historical masterpiece but is definitely worth watching.<br />
<br />
So yeah, jump in and watch it. You might even like it if you didn&#039;t like the first season to the different approach. I highly suggest giving it a chance.<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10.

    Now finally finished !<br />
<br />
Okey then , so after finished this anime that i like soo much its time to say the magic words , was it good or bad?<br />
<br />
_story_ <br />
<br />
Story is great , Its the normal bad guy on the run after doing something &#039;&#039;bad&#039;&#039;.<br />
After he gets involved with this girl that is later showing herself as a very &#039;&#039;special&#039;&#039; girl , and ending up following him on their journy from russia to Tokyo.<br />
<br />
<br />
_art_<br />
<br />
Art , oh yes number 1 thing i like with DTB is the art style , always liked it since i saw the first season, the way they make each char stand

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19738">
        out makes this so much better to watch then other anime series, other series have this &#039;&#039;trend&#039;&#039; that they look alike to much , so its much easier to recognize a char in the series with DTB art.<br />
<br />
_Sound_<br />
<br />
Sound is good,  dramatic music occurs on the right moment, and same with the calm and easy scene&#039;s , liked the OP very much, this was actully the first anime serie i&#039;v watched the OP in all episodes for awhile, thats a big pluss from me :)<br />
<br />
_Character_<br />
<br />
<br />
Hei _ he&#039;s a drunktard?? noo no :p he&#039;s stil the calm and serious guy , but something i miss is the funny act he puts on sometimes in public... where did that go?<br />
<br />
Mao _ haha yes i love this guy , smart little animal always coming with funny quotes :)<br />
<br />
July _ Still the awesome , surprising kid that ended up with Hei and the gang. havent really changed at all , or did he change during the seris? <br />
<br />
Suou _ Cute little girl that ends up with hei, this girl amazed me alot actully, so strong and know what she wants , this girl was my number one char after the second episode.<br />
<br />
Misaki _The girl had stopped her life as a cop and ended up somewhere else uh ? well i stil like she wants to find Hei , so she joined new force&#039;s. Liked to see her on the screen.<br />
<br />
_Enjoyment_<br />
<br />
Very enjoyable , was sitting and bitting my teeth after each episode and couldent wait for the next one , something that annoyed me abit , however its full of action , not to much humor , nor dramatic . However i wouldent mind if they made it abit longer , perhaps 24 episodes?<br />
<br />
<br />
_Overall_<br />
<br />
All in all , is Darker then BLACK Ryuusei no gemini an exellent serie to watch for those that watched the first season , this one u&#039;ll see old and new face&#039;s , and it got a very high watch factor from me , it wont be long until i rewatch it i guess.<br />
<br />
Great serie! give us more :)<br />
<br />

    Compared to the first season this is pretty bad. Even though I watched episode after episode hoping for something to happen all I ended up with was frustration.<br />
Kiko in the first season stuck out enough and now there is the cross-dressing father and his idiot son plus strange characters appearing without barely an explanation. Sure DTB is a series where you have to think about the hows and whys but we are still pretty much left without a hint about contractors and dolls.<br />
<br />
There is a story to it but it feels lacking provably to the way it evolves. There definitely are good parts in it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23645">
        and plenty of them but there is also lots of stuff that could of had been done better. The &quot;rifle materialization&quot; scene with Suou is repetitive and feels like it&#039;s being used to waste time. Although Hei&#039;s ability is not what it used to be if feels like he is not even himself and somehow is very fortunate of the outcomes of his problems.<br />
A least some characters have their own uniqueness to them and we learn a few things about them and their history.<br />
It&#039;s not terrible by its self, but it is when you are expecting something along the lines of the first season.<br />
<br />
Hopefully Darker than BLACK - Kuro no Keiyakusha Gaiden will somehow make up for it.

    Did I just give an anime 10/10 yes I did! This anime is SUPERB in varieties of aspects such as story, art, sound, and characters. It really lacks nothing. This anime is action oriented anime and if you are looking for an action oriented anime that has to do with supernaturals and superpower with awesome story-line right now, this anime is just for you.  Although, watch the 1st season first!

    If “Darker Than Black” was a band than their follow up album would be considered selling out. “Ryuusei no Gemini” is nothing like the first season coming across as an entirely different anime. It panders to the audience, the action is over the top, the soundtrack is less memorable, and the direction of the entire anime is different. Not all the pieces connect properly, but it is a decent follow up to the first season of “Darker Than Black”. It never reaches the same heights of season one, but it does have its own strength that makes it worth watching including an ending that is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175147">
        best described as unsatisfactory. <br />
<br />
Oh, there will be minor spoilers. While not intentional and kept vague as possible, it takes place a whole year after the first season of Darker Than Black and Darker Than Black: Gaiden four part OVA. It’s recommended you avoid this review for that purpose alone. I suggest seeing the previous season and OVA’s before reading or entirely ignoring this review. <br />
<br />
Good: Different direction and different strengths<br />
<br />
“Ryuusei no Gemini” from the first episode tells an overarching story. Focusing on two leading characters, Hei and Suou Pavlichenko, each with their own unique storylines. Hei story arc deals with finding Yin while Suou storyline deals more with finding answers about her family and her past. These two characters have different goals allowing the core of the main story to progress smoothly. Providing a different viewpoint from their adventure. How Hei goes about achieving his goal is vastly different to how Suou goes about reaching her goals. Suou goal is more personal vocalizing her thoughts in any situation without hesitation. Understanding how she feels throughout the entire season is plain as day. Hei is more tormented and defeated with his storyline in vein of a redemption story. Attempting to finish what he originally couldn’t because of his emotions. <br />
<br />
The first season of “Darker Than Black” went for capturing noir and “Ryuusei no Gemini” goes for capturing the action genre. Accomplishing this by having a major revelation or action scene occur in every episode attempting to imitate the effect of a cliffhanger to encourage the viewer to see the next episode immediately. There is rarely ever a moment of safety for the heroes wherever they go. Someone is always behind them chasing them down. Another added inclusion from the change in direction is the material is allowed to show more emotion. Characters in general across more lively in the series without the usual restrictions emotionless contractors are written in.<br />
<br />
One noticeable difference from “Ryuusei no Gemini” from the rest of the series is the comedy plays a bigger role. Jokes are thrown into every episodes instead of spread out through out the series on special occasions. Its favorite kind of jokes involves everyone confusing Suou for her twin brother. There’s a recurring gag involving Genma Shizume making flirtatious remark at Suou unknowing to him she’s actually a girl. It’s a funny recurring joke since it doesn’t reuse it frequently and offers other forms of humor to keep it varied. Mostly from Mao who despite a change of appearance hasn’t lost his ability for spouting sarcastic remarks. <br />
<br />
The supporting cast is larger in “Ryuusei no Gemini” getting the short end in characterization. This is very noticeable from the first episode when it decides to bring in characters from the first season only sideline them. Within the first episode, a specific character that had a big role in season one gets killed off quickly. The supporting characters that do influence the story generally don’t have much of a screen presence. Little characterization is mostly to blame resulting in a support cast to be only known for a single a trait. Mina Hazuki is a badass when she’s in combat, but the most memorable aspect about her personality is she’s a lesbian. Genma Shizume is a comedic pervert whose terrible at his job. There is not a single scene when he’s shown doing his competently on the field. Another character is Norio who first appears in episode four with a storyline hinting he would play some important role in the story. Norio is forgotten about past episode six and his time in the series is superfluous in the main story. Some other characters fade into the background because they operate behind the scenes, but never is their influence felt. <br />
<br />
The ending is a major drawback this season because Suou whole motivation is to find answers. Her arc takes as much time to tell as Hei&#039;s does. This gives “Ryuusei no Gemini” a whole different direction of solving mysteries so leaving unanswered questions is a negative. By the time episode twelve finishes despite every bit of information being told to the viewer what happened it won’t turn out satisfactory. Hei is the only character who could serve as the backbone for the entire anime series from beginning to end. Details of what occurred to Hei is left in the open interpretation department which is more than a disappointment given at this point Hei is a strong three dimensional character. Leaving an open ending for Hei journey unlike the rest of the cast members makes it that much more unsatisfying.<br />
<br />
Mixed: Good Leads, Unwhelming Supporting Cast<br />
<br />
Hei in “Ryuusei no Gemini” is at his lowest point in the franchise. Gone is the carefree side of his personality coping with his inner depression with alcohol. He’s frequently serious in nearly every scene which is a change of character for Hei. In general though, Hei doesn’t get much added to him in terms of characterization. However, he does face new conflicts to overcome this season. Hei might not be the same person he was at the start of the franchise, but is still a well written character. He’s smart in situations that require him to think on the spot to survive. Despite how he turned out he does is sympathetic towards other characters, but expresses it differently from before. <br />
<br />
Mao goes from a wise cat to a flying squirrel who asides from giving some sarcastic remarks and comedic relief has his importance to the story minimize. No longer does Mao gather intel for Hei or his group and instead helps out the heroes directly in small ways. He’s more active on screen sometime blocking people views or being some sort of distraction. Such moments don’t appear often enough to change the fact his importance to the story is not what it use to be. In return, Mao does receive characterization when fans finally get to see how he looked in his human form. It might only last a single episode seeing his past human self for the first time is a treat for fans. <br />
<br />
Suou Pavlichenko is a red hair, 13 year old Russian girl photographer who becomes a sniper. She plays a major role in the story seeing everything in the world of contractors for the first time, but for any viewer following this anime series in order will already know everything Suou does not. Her character will be more relatable for anyone who has not seen the world of “Darker Than Black” at this point, but adds to seeing first hand the evolution of a human turning into a contractor. She’s a decent character...Studio Bones thought otherwise in how she’s used. In 11 out 12 episodes Suou appears naked at some point or appear in some scene that provides fanservice. Yeah, one entire episode out of twelve doesn’t use Suou in some way to pander to its audience. To name a few instances in the first episode there is a (are they ever not) pointless shower scene, episode three she’s in a cabin drying wet clothes only being cover by a blanket follow by interpreted bad position, in episode four there is Suou dancing which would be fine if it weren’t how that moment was framed, in episode eight swimsuits, and can’t forget the anti-tank rifle summoning sequence (in which Suou appears naked) is always shown in its entirety every time it gets summoned. These are a couple of examples of how the anime treats her which is honestly far worse than anything Hei ever does to Suou in the anime. <br />
<br />
Like mentioned earlier the supporting cast is larger and some get sidelined. Misaki Kirihara from season gets sideline whose involvement in the story is unneeded. Her role in this season is minimize uncovering a conspiracy behind the scene that doesn’t do add much for the story. What ultimately ends up happening to her in the aftermath of the finale is far more relevant than anything she does before it ends. Due to the length of the anime the characters don’t receive the needed attention to have their own arcs or be fleshed out beyond introduction. Which why the likes of Yoko Sawasaki, Genma Shizume, Mina Hazuki, and Michiru are kept very simplistic from start to finish. The only exceptions to this are Dr. Mikhail Pavlichenko and Shion Pavlichenko because they are connected to Suou storyline. Throughout the series, there are flashbacks that reveal important pieces of information fleshing them out from when the season begins. Once it’s over, Dr. Mikhail and Shion have more to define them unlike the rest of the cast that remains the same. <br />
<br />
Good: Bones Studio Aces Their Animation <br />
<br />
The animation is done by Bones Studio like the rest of the anime series. Animation in “Ryuusei no Gemini” allows Studio Bones to show off what they can do. Having a more diverse cast in age range compare to the rest of the series. There’s a fair mix of children and adults where previous entries mostly had adult characters. As usual, all characters have unique designs that can be told apart easily even if all the characters hair color were the same. In movement it moves smoothly with no hiccups regardless what’s on screen. Backgrounds once again are detailed, though this time mostly contained in industrialized cities. There’s no environment that is unique to “Ryuusei no Gemini” specifically. However, it does claim the honor of having the best action sequences in the entire series. <br />
<br />
The action scenes have flashy effect with over the top powers use in battles. There’s no usage of 3D in these action scenes as Studio Bones spares no expense for them. Battles are flashy sporting particle effects of all kind from sparks when two melee weapons hitting each other, to an explosion with intense flames, to anti-tank rifle that pierces through concrete or metal, and whatever effects to its disposal. Episode three has a sequence where a stationed train is hit by another train causing train carts to start flying through the air. It does not use 3D in any frame of that sequence which looks great when seen. Unfortunately there isn’t another sequence in the rest of the series that tops that spectacle, but the other action scenes aren’t any less impressive because of it. Every action scene has a flashy effect unique to that specific action sequence. In one episode it has a character merging with a vehicle manipulating it for combat. Goofy sounding as that description is in execution it’s actually creative while not being a one sided battle. <br />
<br />
Throughout my reviews for the “Darker Than Black” franchise I always suggested seeing the anime with English subtitles and this season is why. In the English dub, Suou dialogue receives the most alteration of any character changing the tone of several scenes becoming grating to listen too. Alison Viktorin who voices Suou delivers a solid performance, but some of her dialogue does her a disservice making her come across as a little brat. Another factor that prevents her performance from being decent is she doesn’t sound like a thirteen year old. That would be easy to overlook, but she has a few scenes where she has to loudly vocalize her complaints. Due to the English script changes it varies from Suou coming across sympathetic or just wanting to see Hei hit her. As much Alison Viktorin is capable in the role playing off her cast member just fine, the English script gets across something else than originally intended.<br />
<br />
In the Japanese cast Kana Hanazawa voices Suou who sounds more like a thirteen year old. Her performance is more subtle in vocalizing Suou’s emotion. Unlike Alison Viktorin who voices the same character, Hanazawa comes across as sympathetic with her delivery of the dialogue. She makes Suou sympathetic and likable. The closer the anime gets to the ending the more range Kanazawa is allowed. Her chemistry with her co-stars is spot on especially when together Sawaki Ikuya and Hidenobu Kiuchi coming together naturally. <br />
<br />
Hearing Kent Williams deep voice coming out of a small Momonga (fancy name for a Japanese dwarf flying squirrel) is quite odd. Like in season one, Kent Williams is spot on with his sarcastic remarks being the most hilarious in the English dub cast. Hearing such a small animal talk in such a deep sounding voice sticks out. In the Japanese cast, Sawaki Ikuya voice never becomes noticeable when playing the same character. While I prefer Kent Williams playing Mao in the series, Sawaki Ikuya has a voice that better blends into the character. Never does Ikuya voice become a distraction making it easier to become immerse with the character. <br />
<br />
As usual (no surprise) regardless of who is heard both Hidenobu Kiuchi and Jason Liebrecht shine in their portrayal of Hei. The direction of the anime is different, but the changes does not affect how they portray their characters. Both of voice actors retain Hei characteristics managing to make the transition between seasons seem seamless. Creating a performance that works with the changes of the series. There’re no hiccups in how they portray Hei. The supporting cast in both the Japanese and English dub cast play their characters in a straightforward manner. With more comedy, it’s more difficult to distinguish any standout in the supporting cast. Doesn’t really offer much range when half the cast has to deliver comedy. <br />
<br />
If you had to choose between sub or dub I would recommend English sub for the entire franchise and English subtitles for this season. The Japanese cast performance are consistent throughout the entire anime franchise where the English dub stumbles in important areas as it goes on. There’re also some script changes in the English dub that goes against what was originally intended to get across. The English dub isn’t bad with Kent Williams and Jason Liebrecht reprising their roles they excel in portraying. Making the English worth alone for their performances, but they are the only aspects of the English dub that remain strong in every iteration. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack done compose by Yasushi Ishii this season which forgettable. Like in the four-part Gaiden OVA, the soundtrack is a mixture of rock tracks, techno, and lighter sounding tracks for the more personal moments in the series. None of the tracks stand out on their own without the accompany of visuals. Within the series, it works while simultaneously being forgettable. Instead of strengthening a scene, it just fades into the background. The opening theme “Tsukiakari no Michishirube” by Stereopony is a pop/rock track. Optimistic lyrics  with Aimi Haraguni lack of conviction don’t go hand in hand, but is a decent opening song that works fine for the intro. In spite how the series actually is, it’s a great fit for the intro. Same goes with the ending track “From Dusk Til Dawn” by Abingdon Boys School. “From Dusk Til Dawn” is pop sounding using acoustic guitars and synthesized strings. It starts off soft going to the sounding more melodramatic when it ends. <br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment: More entertaining, but not as good<br />
<br />
I was more entertained seeing “Ryuusei no Gemini” over the original season since it started with an overarching story and maintained it till completion. It also delivered on the action scenes all which never failed to be a feast for the eyes. However, it was entirely different in tone, pacing, and direction from what season one provided. Everything that made season one great was lost or downgraded in “Ryuusei no Gemini”. Season one characters get sideline, there was allot more pandering, contractors powers got over the top, and the ending wasn’t entirely satisfactory. I wasn’t expecting “Ryuusei no Gemini” to be the way it was, but at the same time I am not upset it did something different (ironically playing it safe) than rehashing itself. Instead of delivering something out of my expectations it deliver it exactly what I expected from it in the first place. For better and worse, it was still an enjoyable ride.<br />
<br />
Anime Series Overview:<br />

In retrospect “Darker Than Black” is an anime series that has something different to offer in each iteration. Season one contains strong writing and great characters. Taking it sweet time before it develops it main cast, but a great first season all the way through. “Darker than Black: Gaiden” four-part OVA offers the best mixture of both season containing the strong writing of season one and the great action scenes of season two. It’s also the most rushed with only four episodes to its story. “Ryuusei no Gemini” is pure entertainment that noticeably panders in order to reach a greater audience. Losing traits that made season one great and in return going in another route succeeding for different reasons. It’s not the follow up one would expect the first season to receive, but has its own strength. I have to sound like a broken record at this point writing about this series multiple times in a single month. If you read all my reviews of this anime series or just this one thank you very much.<br />

Disappointment would be the defining word for this follow up season to “Darker Than Black”. It’s nothing like the first season and all the characters from season one get sideline for a new cast most of which aren’t developed the same degree of one-shot characters in the first season. It’s not quite the follow up some fans might have wanted, but it’s a decent anime through and through. All the characters story arcs get concluded, the action scenes are fast with great choreography, and ends the series on a positive note. Where Darker Than Black ended up with “Ryuusei no Gemini” will be varied when viewers reach the end, but the journey to get there was one thrilling adventure that’s worth taking.<br />

    I&#039;m not even going to break this down because I&#039;ll spoil something. Also! While this is just as good as the last season, it is different. I cannot stress that enough, and for some it will be a deal breaker.<br />
<br />
EDIT: After complaints I decided to expand this review. I&#039;ll put out spoiler alerts if they come up.<br />
<br />
Story: Excellent, it seems to be a character driven story, and the characters are excellent. The problem is if you don&#039;t care for a certain character, then you don&#039;t care for the story, so you have to be invested in the story. That being said, somehow, even a character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review124979">
        that I was annoyed with, just like the protagonist actually made my eyes tear up with the excellent direction, voice acting and overall execution.<br />
<br />
In this story, there are special people called contractors. They&#039;re called that because they lack emotion, think logically for themselves, can use superpowers, but at a price. They might have to break a finger, or bake a cake. Hei is an interesting character that you&#039;ll care a lot more about later on, even though at first you think he&#039;s an absolute jerk, which he basically is.<br />
<br />
Art: Also excellent, the scenes are even better than the first season which is a definite plus, although, I wasn&#039;t terribly fond of the CGI bugs. Whenever there&#039;s a fight, everything is fluid and drawn very well. There isn&#039;t any sort of exaggerated physics except in some close up deaths, which is more for a shock factor.<br />
<br />
Sound: Excellent, I liked the English voice overs, although it should be noted that most of the time characters talk in monotone because they&#039;re contractors or they&#039;re trying to explain something in the same about of talking space as the Japanese version. Still, when something emotional happens, just like the last season, you can feel it in their voice.<br />
<br />
Character: Perfect. I cannot stress this enough, there is so much character development, even in one episode. The writers did an outstanding job.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Perfect. I&#039;ve watched it over and over again. I really would love a Season 3.<br />
<br />
Overall: I&#039;m giving it 9/10 because while I absolutely love it and would rate it 10/10 personally, it is closer to a 9/10 simply because some people will find the story unsatisfying with how it ends.

    I don&#039;t know how anyone could give this season a score of 10.  If you saw the first season then I don&#039;t know how anyone can say this season was just as good or better than the first one.  In my opinion the first one was much better.<br />
<br />
The story was decent and even though I do have a few complaints about the story it did keep me mostly interested in what was going to happen next.  I wished more things were explained in the story.  I mean yeah I did kind of expect some mystery like in the first season but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22642">
        come on in this one barely anything was explained.  The only thing that was explained in full was how Mao lost his body.  I just finished watching it and I&#039;m not sure what exactly the ending was all about.  I kind of understand but in the same time I&#039;m still trying to get it all.  When I saw the ending I was like wait what, that is why Suou existed... and yeah I could go on and on about it but I don&#039;t want to spoil the ending.  The story was decent since it kept me interested, but to be honest after watching the first season I felt quite disappointed about this story.<br />
<br />
The characters were kind of disappointing to be honest.  The only character that personality stayed the same was Mao(the squirrel) who used to be a cat and Misaki who is in Section 3 now.  Hei who used to be the lead protagonist in the first one lost his charm.  It is like he got super depressed after the first one.  Maybe being separated from the doll Yin(which is also not explained) has made him all sad.  Even if life did make him depress why is he beating up on children now?  Even though towards the end he does recover some personality it still wasn&#039;t the same Hei I liked back in the first season.  Suou who is the lead female protagonist in the story was good.  The only thing I can complain about her was how lame her power was.  Awesome she can make a big gun materialize which she still has to clean and take care of...?<br />
<br />
I did enjoy watching this for the most part.  Sure there were a few plot holes here and there(even more than the first season) that were never explained and my favorite character Hei is a drunk who beats up on children now I still weirdly enough kept wanting to watch to know what was going to happen.  It wasn&#039;t bad but it definitely did not deserve a 10.  Even if you didn&#039;t see the first season therefore didn&#039;t have to compare it to that one it still wouldn&#039;t deserve a 9 or a 10.  In fact it would probably just make you even more confused.  <br />
<br />
Overall I give this a 7 even though in my head it keeps going between a 6 and a 7.<br />

    Note:<br />
This is a review of the first 5 episodes, I will make the possible changes by the end of the season. I also made it so that this review contains the least amount of spoilers possible.<br />
<br />
After watching the first 2 episodes I was instantly hooked on Darker than Black. It&#039;s totally a great amine, and would probably be up in the top 10 after done airing.<br />
<br />
If you haven&#039;t seen Darker than Black yet then I highly recommend it. I usually watch drama/romance anime but this got me, this got me good. Darker than Black bases off of these special people named contractors, and yes these

        type of people like in most anime have special abilities, but this is where it becomes different and unique; the contractors have to use remuneration, or something that has to be done to use these so called contractor powers, this could range from making origami to ripping the hell out of your hair.<br />
<br />
Another thing I love about this anime is how they add in little details like when a meteor falls a contractor supposedly dies. This is not the case with the main character though (watch anime, trying not to spoil), even when he loses his meteor he still lives. Other details would be: flashbacks giving information in the gap between the first and second season, changes to the characters because of factors from the first season, and making more of an emphasis on &quot;remuneration.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now the sound in Darker than black is superb! The opening tells a story in itself, it basically tries to input the message that when you become a contractor everything that you have, your dreams, and everyone that you hold dear will be lost, and that you have to keep moving forward. You will find this true within the anime as you progress through. The background music in the anime fit it very well, it was fast paced and complimented the action greatly. The voice actors fit each and everyone of their characters and are acted out very well. The only thing I had disagreement on sound was that the ending had pretty much almost nothing to do with the anime.<br />
<br />
The art has also improved a considerable amount. In season one of this anime the effects were great and artwork was well done. Now in season two of Darker than Black, the artwork has been given more detail; effects being notched up, lighting and shading more present especially in the effects, and even a 3D perspective is added in.<br />
<br />
Now the characters in the anime change drastically from season one. This is most likely from the problems aroused from season one. You see big changes from the main characters. One of them transitions from a cold-blooded killer working for a syndicate, to being a alcoholic working for the government. Other major character developments are that innocent people became involved and actually became the once normal living people into emotionless contractors.<br />
<br />
Overall I enjoyed this anime and gave it a 9. The originality, art, and the new ideas coming from this anime convinced me to give it a 9. Hopefully by the end of this season (which I don&#039;t want this anime to ever end), I will go over this review again and most likely give it a 10 if this anime keeps impressing me.

    Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor<br />
<br />
(JAP title: Ryuusei no Gemini)<br />
<br />
The sequel to one of my all-time favorites… I went in with high expectations and I came out confused.<br />
<br />
[ 1 MINUTE REVIEW ]<br />
<br />
This is the highly anticipated sequel to the critically acclaimed first season. It does not follow the usual two episode arc style, as in the first season. This is not necessarily a bad thing as it transforms into your more stereotypical shounen anime, which might appeal to many. Sadly, I am not one of them. Due to the complete shift in genre, Darker than Black, Gemini of the Meteor is no longer a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31752">
        slick Ocean’s 11 sort of anime, but rather a more brutal and Contractor version of Karate Kid, with a pro Contractor showing a young one the ropes. The music and animation are on the same plane as last season. However the ending is a tad confusing even after watching the OVA. Those who were absolute devotees of the original DtB should watch it regardless of its transformation to know the fate of their beloved characters. Others keep away!<br />
<br />
[ 5 MINUTE REVIEW ]<br />
<br />
Alright, let me get one thing straight – This is not Darker than Black. Maybe technically it is, but in reality, it is not. This show would’ve been better off being named just “Gemini of the Meteor”. You can almost consider this anime as a completely new one, featuring Contractors and the cast of Darker than BLACK. If you’re looking for the exact same thing you liked in the first season, then this show is not for you.<br />
<br />
That aside, let’s gets started with the synopsis. It has been two years since Hei destroyed the Saturn System in Hell’s Gate and a LOT of events has occurred after that and before the beginning of season two. To understand all the changes that took place, one has to watch the OVA. But, I recommend you watch the OVA after you’re done with the second season. I’ll give a brief description on what happens in the time gap without giving any spoilers. Yin is separated from Hei. Hei is a bearded drunkard who works for the CIA. Misaki is fired from her old job and hired in an organization called Section 3, which is made up of Contractors. Oh, and one last thing – Hei is no longer a Contractor. <br />
<br />
In Dtb:GoM, you follow Suou, a Russian girl who speaks Japanese. I suppose that makes her a Eurasian, but whatever. Young Suou is a normal girl, who goes to school and lives with her father in the mountain. However, her brother is kept a secret from the world as he is a Contractor and in Russia, all Contractors must be enrolled in the army. One day, her life is turned upside down when her best friend turns into a Contractor and Hei appears at Suou’s house. She is then chased by nearly eight contractors and the Soviet army, yet she manages to escape from them all. If every little girl can get past the Soviet army, I really don’t know why they’re called a superpower. Anyway, moving on, Hei and Suou unite and thus begins their journey to go to Japan. The pacing is overall, good, but if you start watching this season immediately after the previous one, you might find it a bit confusing as you would be used to the bi episodic arcs. GoM contains only 1 storyline, which spans 12 episodes. And this storyline does not involve any undercover work, womanizer Li or well-defined side characters. And this is why I said this season is nothing like the previous. But that is not to say it is a bad anime. In fact, it is very entertaining. Once you get over your initial disappointment, you will start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The plot is actually good and it has enough twists and turns to keep you at the edge of your seat. There are some moments when you honestly go “Whoa, I did not see that coming…” and that is proof that the script is very strong. Although the second season was very different from the first, it did have one similarity, DtB’s trump card – the emotional connection. You are able to truly feel the character’s emotions and this one factor is enough to propel you from the first to the last episode of the series.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned earlier in the short review, there are no major improvements in the visual department, which is still not a setback as the first season boasted one of the best graphics. <br />
<br />
Music is once again solid, with a few more sentimental and soft tracks added. This was a really neat addition as it helps emphasize Suou’s loneliness beautifully. The OP was a great track, with a good beat and definitely worth listening to every time. The ED on the other hand was very generic and doesn’t deserve and special credit. The voice actors have done a solid job, especially Suou’s. <br />
<br />
Now, as far characters are concerned, Hei has undergone a major change. He’s grown his hair out, got a beard and has a bottle of sake (alcohol) glued to his hand. When he decides to take Suou under his wing, he trains her using a remarkable method – If she doesn’t get it right, smack her in the head till she does. Simple isn’t it? (And this “unique” training method was the reason I compared it to Karate Kid). The character development for both is very typical tsundere. Basically, if you like shonen, it’s difficult to go wrong with this anime. <br />
<br />
The Bottom-line:<br />
Darker than Black:Gemini of the Meteor is a highly enjoyable anime if you just forgive the generic characters and shonen transformation.<br />
<br />
(P.S – MILD SPOILER AHEAD – The animation clip of Suou using her ability is an absolute DISGRACE to the slickness of the franchise. I found myself banging my head on the wall every time the anti-tank rifle stuck out of the semi naked kid.)<br />
<br />

    This is by far one of the best anime i have ever seen. The twists in the story is enjoyable while still maintaining the viewer&#039;s hunger to watch for more. One thing about the Anime is that you can never cease to be amazed how superb the animation was done.<br />
<br />
The story takes place after the first season which is more like a continuation of the original series. If you haven&#039;t seen season one yet - i strongly suggest you first watch the first season before continuing to read this review.<br />
<br />
The opening and ending tracks of the anime were also a notable feature in the series

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21732">
        itself wherein other anime don&#039;t really give much concern about how the intro and ending soundtracks will affect the anime throughout.<br />
<br />
The new characters to the season has a major role in the series, more like a big plot twister. I deeply enjoyed the new characters altogether and the thing with the syndicate was far most the less intrigueing part of the Series.<br />
<br />
I hope you guys will enjoy the Anime as well as i did and yet again I can say that it will be one of your best time spent on watching this! <br />

    I was actually pissed off from this sequel to darker than black, after watching the first season and the specials i had high hopes since other two were pretty damn good. The second season made Hei  a drunk and a lot less of a badass in my opinion. The story was confusing and boring, it made Mao a freaking squirrel, and brought us Suou, a really annoying girl with a really dumb contractor ability. The only reason i probably finished this anime was b/c it was darker than black and i decided to keep going to see if got any better but it didnt,

    I really enjoyed the first I guess season of Darker than black. It was entertaining, had a good story and enjoyable characters. <br />
<br />
Darker than Black: Ryuusei no Gemini is enjoyable as well, but not as enjoyable as the first season. It feels like a completely different series. Like someone has taken the characters from Darker than Black and put them into a different Tv show.  So I will list some pros and cons of this series. <br />
<br />
Pros<br />
<br />
1. The action is good and Hei still kicks ass. <br />
<br />
2. The story is good and quite interesting. Quite different from Darker than Black but still enjoyable. <br />
<br />
3.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160603">
        The characters are quite well done, the new ones and old ones. <br />
<br />
4. I really liked the intro and outro music, this is just personal taste here but it is really good and fits nicely with this series. <br />
<br />
Cons <br />
<br />
1. There isn&#039;t that much action, and what little action there is, is over quite quickly. Now I&#039;m not saying there should be non stop action, but the fight scenes they did have could have easily been dragged out a bit to make them more exciting. <br />
<br />
2. The story was confusing as hell for me. Now this comes down to a fault of my own, I didn&#039;t watch the OVAs that connect Darker than Black with this series. So because of that I was very confused in a lot of parts and couldn&#039;t quite figure out what was going on. So anyone reading this, watch the OVAs otherwise you won;t have a clue what is really happening. <br />
<br />
3. It was really nothing like the first Darker than Black, which I mentioned above. So anyone who is a real diehard fan of the first season might not like this one as much, though casual watches will enjoy it. I&#039;m not saying fans of the show will hate it, but don&#039;t go into it expecting it to be the same as Darker than Black. <br />
<br />
4. Since I didn&#039;t watch the OVAs this series felt a bit to short for me and could maybe have been a couple episodes longer. Because of the shortness of it, you don&#039;t really care as much for the side characters in it. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, this was still an enjoyable anime. It had some really great moments in it and is a good anime to watch when you have a day off and just want to chill out. Even if you forget to watch the OVAs like me it&#039;s still pretty good, just a lot more confusing.

    Darker than Black Genesis of the Meteor<br />
<br />
Well, where should I start? I honestly liked Darker than Black since the first episode, I got that vibe of “I&#039;m going to like this” since the first episode and that’s is basically the same feeling I got with this second season.<br />
<br />
[THIS WILL BE A SPOILERS FREE REVIEW - Only the names of the MC will be named]<br />
<br />
I’ve seen many people commenting that they hate this season, that is bad, bla bla bla. I tell you what, this season is awesome. Don’t let other people tell you it’s bad because it is not.<br />
Yes, this season is different from the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224164">
        original Darker than Black but it keeps the essence.<br />
<br />
<br />
This season takes another aim to what the first Darker than Black was. It still has our beloved Hei, but it doesn’t take place immediately after the ending of the first season. We find out that this season has a new main character, and Hei takes a secondary role in this story. Take it as a new stage of Hei’s life and his story. There are new and interesting characters, returning old faces, feels and plot twists that made me keep watching.<br />
<br />
This season is different, but different doesn’t mean it is bad. Some people may not be receptive to change but once you accept that you will see the beauty of this season.<br />
<br />
[ Story | 7-8 ]<br />
The new story sets about 2 years after the events of the first season, and at the beginning takes us to Russia where we will meet our new MC. That’s it, I’m not diving more into the story. I will tell you that the changes implemented in this season made it feel fresh, different, mysterious and at the same time familiar with what we’ve been experimented before. My hype went up just with the first episode.<br />
<br />
[ Art | 7 ]<br />
The art style is the same, but the animation got an upgrade. Movements feel good and smooth. The 3DCGI got an improvement too so as the special effects. What I’m trying to say it is pleasant to the eye.<br />
<br />
[ Music | 7 ]<br />
This season packs a new OST that fits the new setting and the standards of Darker than Black. The OP is simply marvelous, I liked a lot the visuals that gave me actual feels when watching certain scenes. The ED has espectacular too, both visuals and music, really relaxing and enjoyable. I never skipped the OP or the ED, not even once.<br />
<br />
[ Character | 8 ]<br />
This part is the most important for this second season because the progress and outcome of the story is tied directly to the evolution of our two MC characters. Yes, I said two. Hei will have a huge development in his character that will be crucial for the story, the same goes for our new MC, Suou. Taking focus on the new character, it was easy to like. I find it easy to understand at some times and interesting to know more about at others.<br />
As the first season, there will be times you will inevitably laugh, because there are some character interactions that are truly gold. However, there will be times you will feel sorrow or pity, in the end, this is Darker than Black we are talking about. Feels tend to hit out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
[ Enjoyment | 9 ]<br />
As I said in the beginning, I knew I was gonna enjoy this season, despite everything I read I knew inside me I was gonna like it and there you see, I loved it.<br />
<br />
[ Overall ]<br />
Once again, it was a fantastic season that left me wanting for more (remember that after this season, there are the 4 OVAs of Darker than Black: Gaiden). Keep your mind open to change and this season will not disappoint you.
