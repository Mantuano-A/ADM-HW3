    Esoteric ideologies on the jubilation of owning a Honda Super Cub: Embrace materialism and the consumerist worldview to derive happiness and escape our amalgamated depression. Evocating tranquillity through enthralling artistic direction, incorporating subtle visual prompts, coupled with reserved use of melancholic classical works. Affable characters and eloquent dialogue depicts personal growth through sincere adversity; modest in theming. Predominantly pastel palette landscapes are home to consistently detailed designs and graceful animation, particularly in the CGI. Gleaming with artistic integrity and nuanced prose, Super Cub stands at the forefront of modern Iyashikei. Thank you, Honda and Studio Kai, for sponsoring this short review.

    Watching Super Cub kind of feels like taking a bath. It&#039;s a bit plain and simple, yet never fails to soothe you even when you are having a bad time.<br />
<br />
Super Cub revolves around high school student Koguma, a timid and lonely girl who has never had anything that she could cherish. As Koguma herself describes, she has nothing—no parents, no hobbies, no friends, and no goals. However, after buying a pre-used Super Cub, she finally finds something that even she could enjoy. The anime chronicles the now adventurous days of Koguma&#039;s life, showcasing how vastly she has changed and continues to change.<br />
<br />
Super Cub seems like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404067">
        a simple CGDCT anime at first glance, and if you take the series at face value, it&#039;s likely that you won&#039;t change your opinion even after watching it. Most of the times, the characters of the anime simply travel around various places while riding their beloved scooter. Due to this and the seemingly unimaginative subject matter, it&#039;s easy to mistake Super Cub for another typical CGDCT, but in reality, there&#039;s far more to the show than just that.<br />
<br />
The narrative of Super Cub is fairly simple, but the themes that surround it are surprisingly thorough. Unlike most of its predecessors, Super Cub consistently maintains a solemn tone throughout its 12 episodes, which complements the themes that it tackles. That doesn&#039;t mean this is a sad show, though. Despite the serious undercurrent, Super Cub is actually very relaxing to watch; partly because the atmosphere is charmingly calm and quiet, and partly because most of the events that occur in the anime are intrinsically light-hearted and easy to follow.<br />
<br />
This casual approach to storytelling can be a double-edged sword, though. Super Cub follows a rather basic storyline and mostly relies on the characters to move the plot forward, which places some obvious limitations on the potential scenarios. Due to the apparent lack of &quot;innovation&quot;, some parts of the show can feel a bit monotonous. There are other areas where the writing is very lacking—the prime example of this being the first half of episode 11 which suffers because of the characters&#039; unusually irrational actions, and the fact that Koguma&#039;s unusual background is never explored despite it being the introductory point of her character.<br />
<br />
Luckily, Super Cub balances this simplicity and makes up for its shortcomings with substantial characterization. The most compelling character of the anime is by far Koguma, the protagonist of the story who is a bit of an oddball. If you overlook the fact that her past is shrouded in mystery for no reason, she is surprisingly a very relatable character. Koguma&#039;s initial inability to find motivation in her life is something that resonates with me a lot, so seeing her gain confidence and create genuine friendships is uplifting to say the least.<br />
<br />
In a way, Super Cub is also a very encouraging show. The entire anime delivers a generally wholesome and optimistic message, and all of the main characters beautifully reflect that statement. Koguma, Reiko and Shii—they all have something they love from the bottom of their heart, and they will do pretty much anything to protect that. At first, that something was simply Super Cub (Alex Moulton bike for Shii), but as the three grow closer through interactions, they gradually forge a precious and long-lasting bond that they don&#039;t want to lose either.<br />
<br />
This is essentially what makes Super Cub such an encouraging experience. Seeing Koguma and the others wholeheartedly pursue their dreams honestly made me very motivated and electrified, something which very few shows can manage to do. Additionally, all of our main characters display a remarkable degree of realism and relatability, because of which I quickly found myself rooting for them.<br />
<br />
For the most part, the script of Super Cub is fittingly simple and straightforward, but the lines are crafted in a way such that they are subtle and meaningful. While there aren&#039;t a whole lot of dialogues or monologues in the show which is understandable), ones that are there mostly exist for a significant purpose; they are relevant to the contemporary events and provide insight into the characters&#039; emotions. That said, some of the conversations about motorbikes can be a bit difficult to follow, especially if you are someone like me who has little to no knowledge of vehicles. But hey, this may be something bike enthusiasts can rave about.<br />
<br />
Suitably, Super Cub takes a bit minimalistic approach in terms of its soundtrack. There are quite a few scenes that are intentionally barren of music, which is a clever choice given how neatly it fits in with the calm ambience of the anime. Most of the other scenes are fittingly accompanied with tranquil piano music. The sound effects are pretty good; . The opening song titled &quot;Mahou no Kaze&quot; is alright, and the same could be said about the ending &quot;Haru e no Dengon&quot; which is sung by the voice actors of the main cast.<br />
<br />
Super Cub&#039;s animation is generally very beautiful, albeit the artstyle is a bit cutesy. Since the characters travel a lot in the anime, the scenic designs are rather diverse, memorable, and beautifully animated. Simple backgrounds such as school, shops, houses, etc. are nicely drawn as well, which has become an uncommon trait in anime nowadays. Occasionally, there are some odd uses of CGI, though (usually while the characters are riding or paddling), that don&#039;t really blend in with the background and are a little jarring to look at. Besides that, I honestly don&#039;t have much to complain about.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s saddening that Super Cub hasn&#039;t gained much popularity—it&#039;s arguably one of the better anime of this season. Honestly, I didn&#039;t expect much going into the series, but it didn&#039;t take much time to win me over with its refreshingly calm nature. If you are a fan of the iyashikei subgenre and shows that are subtle with their subject matter, you will probably enjoy Super Cub as much as I did.<br />
<br />
And who knows, you might even become inclined to buy an actual Super Cub.

    I’m a fan of most genres of anime, and love myself a slow paced, wholesome, slice of life anime every once in a while, just to take my mind off of things… And wow has Super Cub surprised me, it exceeded all my expectations, it was love at first episode!<br />
<br />
Story - 8<br />
The story is about a second year high school student named Koguma, she doesn&#039;t lead a very interesting life. She has no parents, no friends and no hobbies to keep her daily life interesting. One day, she acquires a second-hand Honda Super Cub motorcycle and rides it to school. As time goes by, not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394966">
        only does Koguma have a new adventurous life going on all sorts of adventures with her adorable Super Cub, she also forges precious new friendships thanks to her precious little motorcycle. The story, adapted from a light novel, is definitely original, but isn’t anything too special by itself, it&#039;s a girl… riding a motorcycle… But combine it with the subjects listed down below and things become really interesting.<br />
<br />
Art - 8<br />
Artwise Super Cub has been quite stunning, it’s not the best I’ve ever seen and might be a little bit low-key at some points, but it’s still beautiful. Most scenes just fit the chill, slice of life genre/feel perfectly. Leaving me even more impressed were the great details on the close up shots of the motorcycles, I would be lying if I told you guys I don’t want to buy a Super Cub, just like Koguma’s after seeing only 4 episodes. And wow does the CGI look amazing, although it looks a bit choppy in some scenes where she for example takes a turn, it looks amazing and blends in perfectly everywhere else. Character designs again fit perfectly with the show, it’s also incredibly soothing seeing all characters have realistic hair colors, and still giving off a cute wholesomeness vibe with their typically big anime eyes! Luckily there has not been a single moment of ‘fan-service’ yet, personally I feel that would totally ruin this show, but if that&#039;s something you are looking for, this ain’t it for you.<br />
<br />
Sound - 9<br />
I think when it comes to the sound in this anime, it was probably a bigger thing while producing than you might think. Because let’s be real here, there are a lot of different ‘motorcycle sounds’ that they needed to use here, from parking it to riding a clear or bumpy road, you can all tell them apart perfectly by just keeping your ears open. I also love how they perfectly adjust the sound and its volume of the distance of our point of view to the motorcycle! For the OST I don’t really have any complaints as well, it&#039;s super cute, and peaceful at the moments it has to be, it&#039;s exactly doing what it has to do! Now let&#039;s finish off with the OP and ED here, they are really good and fitting, especially the foremost should be punishable to skip when watching the series.<br />
<br />
Character - 8<br />
So our first and most main character is Koguma, a girl whose smile makes your heart melt. She doesn&#039;t live the most interesting life though, she has no parents, no friends and no hobbies to keep her daily life interesting. But as she buys a second-hand Honda Super Cub motorcycle and rides it to school, new ‘adventures’ will be entering her life. She meets another Cub owner named Reiko, who is a lot more outgoing and ends up reaching out thus beginning new precious friendships thanks to her precious little motorcycle. She gives Koguma loads of information and tips about motorcycles, which Koguma takes to heart. The dynamic between these 2 main characters we have been seeing in these first 4 episodes has been great and just way too wholesome, I’m excited to see the third main character enter the story. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10<br />
I have been astonished by how good this show is and how much I am enjoying it right now! This is the 24 minutes of my week where I can truly just relax, take my mind off all the stress life is giving a lot of us, and just enjoy these cute and wholesome girls doing cute and wholesome things. Seeing them enjoy their Cubs as much as they do, really makes you feel just as happy and satisfied as they are, but also makes me feel worried when Koguma feels worried, and scared when she’s scared.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall I think this anime right here is a hidden gem for sure, it is precisely what it wants to be and does a great job entertaining while being extremely chill and not containing any real action! And so I do highly recommend watching this show if you just want to relax and take a break from stressful life or all the hectic anime that are and have been airing recently. Of course if you are interested in Cubs or motorcycles in general for that matter, you already know this is a must watch for you!<br />

    Mild Spoilers in a marked section<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no parents. No money either. Nor do I have any hobbies, friends, or goals for the future. But, where I didn&#039;t have anything in my life before.... now I have a cub.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have always considered myself as a Slice-of-Life enthusiast. I have hardly rated any Slice-of-Life anime lowly but Super CGI has done it. It has broken my streak and that isn&#039;t a good thing. <br />
<br />
I’m just going to begin with the art. Wow, the character designs are ugly. Just take a look at how Studio Kai draws lines. The lines on Koguma&#039;s face makes me think that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404098">
        a cat showed up and scratched her face. Why did the cat do that? It probably couldn&#039;t handle staring at a moe blob anymore. Or maybe the cat had some of the Grappa that the anime staff added &quot;Caution: too much makes it alcoholic and actionable.&quot; But there’s more… The lines drawn on the hair reminds me of someone who pulled out their sturdy fingernails before deliberately scratching a chalkboard! My eyes cringe just as much as just looking at the characters of Super Cub. Continuing on, there is so much CG in this anime. I understand with the Super Cub but using CG for almost every background character and switching between animating the Cub motorbike rider as half 2D and half 3D is just too much. Even if the CG is considered fine, I’m sure the blatant usage of reused animation will get anyone’s disapproval. The one scene that always gets reused is Koguma arriving at school. There will always be the presence of two girls walking together towards the right with two other male characters, one walking towards the camera and the other also walking to the right as the camera pans to the right as Koguma arrives on her Super Cub. I should’ve counted how many times they used this one scene in particular. Throughout this anime, there are many moments where Koguma is just driving around on her Super Cub for entire minutes. The same backgrounds were used so many times, especially at that one intersection and that road she sees outside of her classroom. All in all, the shots and scene durations all made this anime feel like I’m watching the same episode over and over. <br />
<br />
Speaking of loops, I did not care for the music. There is recycled &#039;sad&#039; or &#039;peaceful&#039; oriented music playing for Koguma as she drives around. But these scenes are so long and Koguma’s thoughts are so bland that I don’t care for the music. Many times this music failed to impact me at all since most of it tends to follow a specific formula: 1. Find a cool 2-4 second part, then just keep looping it, 2. Take one finger and play something on the piano that sounds like a song, or 3. Combine 1 and 2!  Very creative I say. This even applied to the opening! To start, we hear Duu 40 times in the beginning of the opening! It won&#039;t be getting out of my head any time soon even if I duu try. Also, when the characters are talking with music playing in the background, I feel that the music is more important than the actual dialogue (which I can&#039;t quite disagree with this). Most interactions between Koguma and others make me feel like I’m waiting in the elevator while trying to ignore the conversation next to me or I’m trying, and failing, to listen to my online Zoom lecture because I fell asleep. <br />
<br />
Finally to the plot of the anime. Sad girl gets a Super Cub and finally makes friends. I think that&#039;s all you need but I will persevere. Koguma is a girl living alone with no parents, income, goals, or friends. She then makes an impulsive decision to buy a Super Cub without having a license. Thankfully, a sudden time skip happens so she can get her license real fast before getting a one minute driving tutorial from the seller. First off, where does she get her money to buy it? How did she learn road rules before learning what gasoline is? I have so many questions without any logical answers. There is another person at her school who notices Koguma’s cub, therefore wanting to befriend Koguma. Moral of the story: Super Cub makes Super Friends. Koguma then learns more about her Cub and runs into possible issues of not having the right gear nor a full understanding of her Cub. However, whenever these problems arise, there is always another random background character that shows up that just so happens to have the answer she needs. Wow, so realistic. <br />
<br />
Koguma is a very flat and basic character. As Koguma continues to understand her Super Cub, the noises she makes whenever she runs into any issues has gotten on my nerves. I’m sick of hearing her whining and I’m sick of her always looking at herself in the Super Cub mirror for no reason. How was she able to take care of herself for so long if she decided to buy a whole cub and not read the owner&#039;s manual (or even search up information about the vehicle) online? Later, as she is able to meet a friend, she starts to smile more. Smiles like these in Slice-of-Life anime are generally meant to be touching for the audience since the character is finally portraying actual happiness past all that they have been or are going through. However this smile was not that. It looked ugly and I did not ever feel for Koguma at all. This smile was not character development nor showing us more about her. It was a forced, placed in smile with no emotional impact whatsoever. I have an easier time smiling with the opening song’s super creative background lyrics of Duus than with Koguma.<br />
<br />
Reiko is kinda better than Koguma. She is a Super Cub enthusiast who desired to be Koguma’s friend because of their similar interest in Super Cubs. Reiko is the bright, happy friend that contrasts Koguma’s sad, quiet character. However, that&#039;s really it to her. She becomes such a side character that she&#039;s basically there for Koguma to have lunch in the same spot in their Super Cubs every single episode. <br />
<br />
[Spoilers]<br />
<br />
Reiko is revealed to dream about being able to climb Mount Fuji with her Super Cub. There&#039;s one episode dedicated to this where she is constantly trying and falling off her Super Cub all while boss battle inspired music is playing. Wow it&#039;s like the mountain is her final boss, it&#039;s as deep as the river in episode 11. Two questions come up during the montage, why is she not looking for bumps in the road to avoid? Why doesn&#039;t she just slow down a bit? I think the real question is: Where did she learn how to drive? Sure the bumps and not being able to slow down can be because of the incline of the road but if she doesn&#039;t know how to deal with it, then why doesn&#039;t she practice and learn how to properly deal with these issues safely? I&#039;m sure off-roaders didn&#039;t just up and go one day to begin their new hobby up a steep mountain. They most likely build up to something more dangerous or risky. But no, Reiko decides to just go all the way. Also, why did the adults just keep letting her go on a road that is easy for her to fall to her doom? Well she has a Super Cub so she&#039;ll be safe even if she herself is being unsafe about driving it. What Reiko really needs to do is pick up a new book about proper off-road driving instead of reading the same random one over and over in class. <br />
<br />
[End of Spoilers]<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime is one of the worst Slice-of-Life anime I have seen (To make sure I am clear, I have nothing against actual Super Cubs in real life). Honda really should’ve done better. Now at least I know where to find a real life CG Super Cub if I really wanted to drive one. A character whose name I forgot once said, &quot;Please save me again with your Super Cub.&quot; Let me rephrase it: Please save me FROM this Super Cub. <br />

    What&#039;s a bike for you? Well, it&#039;s a strange question, but at the same time, Super Cub questions this during his episodes. It is peculiar that for some people is just another type of vehicle, which can be used for work or simply take us faster anywhere we want. But is it just that?<br />
<br />
Koguma has an experience with a Super Cub, a kind of common motorcycle in Japan, which at the same time would not be such a great achievement for us, but that for her, it is a unique and incredible achievement. She lives in a region right away from the rest of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404141">
        city, a quiet, morbid and often dark place. Koguma is a character that fortifies this melancholy perspective, from the first scene of the show, which defines all the simplor sentimental transmission, but at the same time it is very shocking. How can a high school be so shy and absorb the environment naturally and make it an external representation of the introspective of koguma? Super Cub is a show that even with its financial limitations, was competent in his direction, which is honored. The Kai studio is not well known, even though I had some shows. This in specific was the first that really brings a better substantiality of the anime.<br />
<br />
Along with Koguma, we have Reiko and Shii Eniwa. Okay, it is normal to think that both will enter the life of Koguma and will soon disappear from the show, because the anime itself is combined in episodes that do not interconnect. But no, Reiko for example is the first friend that Koguma has in her life. Even if for a simple comment on a school job, the two have the Cub in common. She is dreamer and aims to climb Mont Fuji with the bike. A dream impossible at first sight, but which represents her internal realization. Shii, another trio girl, also knows Koguma (this time with Reiko) by accident. In a need to use the bikes of the pair, shii begins to be interested in this practice and what it has to offer. They are really simple attitudes that are not evidently interesting, but conceptualizes all the magic that Super Cub produces.<br />
<br />
Still on technical quality, the show is concise in the use of colors, contrasts and background sounds. Remember the Koguma scene linking the bike for the first time? This moment represents a change within the character itself with the outside world. Koguma and her motorcycle right now became one. It&#039;s like the feeling of taking care of a pet. For Koguma, a motorcycle is what brings a little happiness and rejoicing it in shady and cold days. It is immeasurable to see the character having his daily difficulties to finally give a rewarding smile. It is a unique emotion in the life of a young schoolboy, who had nothing, at the same time having a Cub represents absolutely everything. Whether at work, in a rain, in a lack of fuel or even in an unknown place, the character slowly overcomes obstacles.<br />
<br />
Friendship with Reiko and Shii is also intensified in these minimal details. For Koguma, it&#039;s a huge challenge to get into and get new friends. Many people go through this uncomfortable sensation daily and the character also represents a little of these people. The message that the show brings is not just taking advantage of the small achievements, goes beyond that. Super Cub causes a strong connection with the public precisely by convincing us to accept and create changes, even if this can be outside our comfort zone. The world is giant and has countless possibilities, only we just act as well.<br />
<br />
Finally, the show is a very pleasurable structure and that teaches us, even with few dialogues or interactions. Even with problems in your artistic production, such as CG (which on some occasions could bother the visual environment), Super Cub is a great synesthetic experience. It&#039;s a show that knows how to be emotional and at the same time is realistic and at the same time is dreamer. It is liberating and aware of your human and personal characters issues. They are aspects like this that I miss in the current animes. The highlight of a season with more than 20 or 30 animes is not in what is more quantitative in information and technical qualities, but in the minimum messages and the affection visible that the creators of the show had with history, animation, characters and everything The remainder that composes an audiovisual project.<br />
<br />
Of course, an anime like Super Cub needs a greater significance character during your events and I wait a lot for a better continuity, whether in the manga, in the light novel or even in a second season (I really really want this to happen , it would be really good!!!). But with only 12 episodes, it&#039;s a show that marked me and you can dial you too. It is an experience that many need to enjoy and have in their lives. Sometimes an anime like Super Cub can make you buy a bike, for example, or convince you to continue dreaming of traveling to a distant place. There are so many things an anime can offer, this is one more that certainly deserves applause for simplicity and impact. Congratulations, Super Cub, you convinced me. You&#039;re a show I needed.<br />

    Okay, I have had enough of this crap. I am tired of sitting on this gosh darn masterpiece of an anime. <br />
<br />
Those of us watching are currently wrapped up in this absolute gemstone of an anime in a season where it is so easy to be covered up. I am here to unravel this wonderful anime about cute girls scooting.<br />
<br />
Before we get into the categories, let me address my first thoughts that made me wary. With all I&#039;m about to say, you may ask &quot;well, who is this being done by?&quot; Well well well, funny you should ask. It&#039;s none other than.... *checks notes* Studio

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395046">
        Kai? Who? Oh, the one&#039;s who made such legendary classics such as... uhh... Okay. So the best thing they got going for them before this anime is Uma Musume S2. This may be a big throw-off for people, but I can assure you that their work on S2 made incredible gains after S1. I was blown away. I genuinely enjoyed Uma Musume S2, but this isn&#039;t about that. This is a relatively new studio that is really starting to push out some great works. This is not the time to be sleeping on them. Keep your eye out. Alright, now on to the categories...<br />
<br />
Alright, let&#039;s start off with the story. Wow. Like... WOW!!! Without getting into too much detail about our characters (you will have to wait a minute for that), this story is currently handing pacing at a great level. It brings us interesting characters that have much to either learn or share that balances out very well for the first 4 episodes of an anime. It doesn&#039;t feel rushed, but it doesn&#039;t feel dragged for said processes along the way. There is absolutely no need to feel rushed about this anime despite what it may seem at first glance. We are along for a great story at whatever pace the directors feel and it feels great to enjoy that gentle breeze of SoL.<br />

Let&#039;s talk about that art. It&#039;s calm, cool, and collected. There&#039;s not incredibly much going on here with the art, but that&#039;s what makes this art pop. When I think of your typical CGDCT anime, I think bright and cheery with popping colors and illustrations. You will not find too much of that here. And you know what? That&#039;s alright! It doesn&#039;t need bright and flashy characters, scenery, and pops that cover up for what the anime has to offer, instead it is raw dogging the watcher for pure anime-watching experience. We see simple, yet effective, art. It really makes it worth it when they add just a bit of color at just the right moments to bring this anime around to looking as it should through the lens of both a watcher and a character. Wonderful.<br />

Man, where do I get started on sound. How about the fantastic OST? If you are a connoisseur of piano music like I am, you are going to appreciate the literature provided in this show. There are a couple classics and some that have an appeal on their own to really add to the show. I don&#039;t think it will ever match the repertoire we see in Nodame Cantabile or Piano no Mori, but that&#039;s to be expected. What&#039;s important is how I am reminded of those shows yet keeping the atmosphere created by said music true to what the show is trying to convey. I can&#039;t wait to hear more.<br />
<br />
Our characters. What we have gotten so far is fantastic. Our MC for various reasons has found no major enjoyments in life. Going through the motions at the pace set by the rest of the world. She doesn&#039;t seem to mind as there&#039;s nothing to really make her question it. Going the same route to school everyday, having the same lunch, going home club. Rinse, repeat, victory. Victory until our heroine finally decides to break her normally emotionless state and, get this, decides riding up hills is too much of a chore. I&#039;m thinking &quot;man, now that&#039;s some relatable content&quot;. She stops by a shop and long story short, gets a cub to make that one part of her life no longer an inconvenience. This will bring out many people around her that she had no idea were there that will change her outlook on life. We have now I guess I would say 3 set-in-stone characters and maybe a couple others that I hope get some more time that have been introduced at a nice and steady pace,The dynamics felt between these characters who never seem to meet is strong and they are all connected by our MC and how she develops through her journey of getting a cub. I want to say more and have left out some really good details so I really encourage you to get on this.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment. I don&#039;t need to say much here. I am literally containing my excitement for this show and oh-so desperately wanting everyone to watch this. I want to talk about this anime with people and there just aren&#039;t that many people out there. I come rushing home to this anime every week now because I know I am genuinely in for a great show. I don&#039;t have many words for this, but I am almost certainly considering this in my top 3 anime of the season at this point.<br />

    There is just. Something real beautiful about Super Cub. Like you need to understand, that this show, isn&#039;t something over the top, it isn&#039;t something with tons of action. But what it is, is something that&#039;s brilliantly done, and really takes you to a zone, you may have never been before. It&#039;s that good to me. I&#039;ve never felt so more interested then I have within a few episodes then I have with Super Cub. Before I even say any more, honestly go watch it, pick it up and start watching it now.<br />
<br />
Story and characters<br />
Both of these fit together. As we follow a poor girl

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394978">
        in Koguma. Whom is basically alone. No real friends at the time of the first episode, along with no parents. As we watch her daily life, and grow, and gaining a second-hand Honda Super Cub motorcycle. Something that she treats as her own child, and it&#039;s just....So cute? It&#039;s as if her smile, is just so pure, so heart warming. To the point that you can only wish her the best, and nothing but the best. <br />
<br />
There are a few other characters within the show thus far. From normal generic characters that push the show along. To her first friend in Reiko who is another Cub rider herself, but it&#039;s just sweet to see our main girl get a friend, a friend who has a simular interest too. The story may not sound interesting, a girl going trough life, riding her bike. But the tone, and the sweetness of te show, it just all fits together so well, to make for an entertaining watch.<br />
<br />
Art and sound.<br />
Here is a part that really stands out. Some shows have kick ass music, some shows just have happy go lucky, or small beats scene by scene. But this show. Does something a little different. As something about this show just feels....Relaxing? Calm, overall nice. Think how Non Non is in a way, their music is just relaxing and fun, while Super Cub gives off more of a chill and relaxed vibe. Something as if like we&#039;re riding our Bike down the road, the wind blowing in our face, nothing to worry about, nothing to fear. It&#039;s just me and my bike. Brilliantly done.<br />
<br />
While the art style is real colourful and good. Which is standard for most shows, and it really makes Super Cub look super pleasing to the eye. The animations look very good too. The style just meshes well with the overall theme of the show. Like, I&#039;d love to give credit to woever made the art and the tone of the show like this, because this is all just wonderful stuff far as I am concerned.<br />
<br />
Should you watch Super Cub? Yes, yes, yes, yes, YES! It&#039;s a super relaxing show, that is also giving you many feels, and really drives home a well thought out show, with it&#039;s slow pacing, and brilliant tone. The first episode alone is enough to really drive that point home, and you won&#039;t be disappointed wen it comes to this show. Go watch it now.

    There are many anime these days telling stories about self-discoveries. I&#039;m talking about a type of show where a protagonist would undergo a dramatic change after meeting new people, experiencing new events, and changes themselves. Super Cub&#039;s main protagonist Koguma is one such character, a lonely girl who takes up a Honda Super Cub and begins her own journey.<br />
<br />
Watching Super Cub is much more than just following a girl&#039;s life and her bike. Let&#039;s remember that Koguma is very lonely and starts out the show friendless with no income, friends, or even a future. A person like this would need to set a serious path

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404074">
        to build their own future if they even want to live in real life. Her physical appearance is also lacking and can be labeled as an &#039;invisible kid&#039; in class. So in essence, Koguma is often in the background and it&#039;s up to herself to stand out. It&#039;s a lot harder than it sounds as she has a repressed personality, one who even has difficulty speaking openly to others. The first few episodes shows that Koguma&#039;s social skills needs improvement but deep at heart, she is a friendly person. She just lacks friends.<br />
<br />
Luckily, fate allow her to meet new people such as Reiko. In sharp contrast to Koguma, Reiko stands out in class as a beautiful girl and easily opens up to others. With a decent knowledge about Cubs, she forges a bond with Koguma through their similar interests. At first, Koguma also has trouble opening up to her but as the series verges on, they build a strong friendship. It&#039;s important to note that Koguma&#039;s own confidence begins to bloom after meeting Reiko. It&#039;s the type of relatable interaction you can discover in anime and in real life. Through their relationship, Koguma is able to interact with others and discover herself in ways she didn&#039;t even realize.  With that in mind, you should know that Koguma and Reiko&#039;s character bond is among the most important in the show.<br />
<br />
Joining them is Shii Eniwa, a shy girl who meets both Koguma and Reiko with their shared interest in Cubs. Unlike Koguma however, she has a future planned out with a dream to open a bakery shop. Together, these three are the heart and soul of this slice of life anime. With every episode, we follow their everyday life adventures and discover what they learn. It&#039;s interesting to note that even as as slice of life, the anime contains a somber and lonely tone in the beginning of the anime. The first episode is especially noticable for the silence and slow pacing. It&#039;s almost an iconic representation of Koguma&#039;s personality, being alone in the world and without friends. After forging friendships with Reiko and Shii, the anime begins to brighten more and develops a more charming mood of elegance. As it should, Super Cub knows what it&#039;s doing when telling its stories. Even as as slice of life, the show has a deeper and real meaning when showing how lonely life can be when you have no friends or connections. Koguma&#039;s life is an example of what a person would be like in real life if they remained friendless. It&#039;s thanks to discovering herself and friends that she becomes much more confident. <br />
<br />
But I won&#039;t lie. Anime like this doesn&#039;t have much of a linear storytelling or deep plot. Even as a complex as seems at times, Super Cub remains fundamentally a simple slice of life show. Every episode shows what these characters goes through in the way we live our own lives. It&#039;s very straightforward and remains realistic throughout every episode. A prominent element included into this show is the Cubs, where we get to see how the show&#039;s bikes functions. Every episode features these bikes and in the beginning, we also get to see how they are maintained on and off the road. Unlike some anime about bikes, this show doesn&#039;t include sports competitions or rivalries. It&#039;s quite the opposite as the characters all share a common interest and it&#039;s what bought them together in the first place. Sometimes, the show may feel like an advertisment for selling a brand but deep down, Super Cub is relatively a simple show that anyone can enjoy<br />
<br />
If you got the impression of a somber show in the beginning, then I don&#039;t blame you. The first few episodes has a gloomy feel that represents Koguma&#039;s loneliness. In fact, I think the director and producers managed to capture the essence of her character through the show&#039;s unique artwork. It has a gray-like style of imagery and backgrounds stands out as static as her character moves with her bike. Koguma&#039;s character expressions is also noticable that undergoes changes with each episode. As I mentioned before, this anime adapts a character&#039;s self discovery and the artwork brings its themes to life.<br />
<br />
Almost every season, there&#039;s that one show where we tend to overlook and forget easily. Super Cub may not be a mainstream anime but I dare say this is a dark horse of 2021. By that definition, the series knew exactly what it had in mind and followed a roadmap to show what a character journey and self discovery is about. Add in the bikes and we have this unique slice of life, one that may be somber at first, but is a reality check of how people can adapt and change.

    With various relaxed slice of life series coming to their end I was worried I would not be able to find something to properly replace slow paced shows I watch for relaxation purposes. Thankfully Supercub brings us a warm story of a girl and how a motorbike changed her life. Its worth bringing to your attention that this show is episodic and you should not expect anything significant in terms of plot or overarching story, the show is simply a glimpse into the life of a girl and her friends who bond over their hobby. This review will cover various aspects of the show including

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404069">
        art quality and characters but leaving out story as its not relevant, there will be an overall score at the end. This review will not contain any plot relevant spoilers, mainly because there is nothing to spoil.<br />
<br />
The animation in this series is effective but in a rather subtle way, there is no flashy sakuga or over the top highly detailed scenes, instead the whole show is portrayed in a very fluid and lifelike manner. Characters pouring water looks great, hair movement looks lifelike, perfect transitions to smiles, characters clothes move well with the wind, snow is knocked up by the bikes in a way that feels natural, essentially the animation style carefully immerses the viewer by animating everything to a realistic degree. Nothing is animated in a particularly advanced or flashy way, but everything that should move does move, there is some CGI used for the bike that is a bit distracting but otherwise its some of the most carefully executed motion I have seen in a TV anime in a while.<br />
<br />
For characters, Koguma and Reiko were a down to earth and realistic portrayal of friends bonding over a shared hobby, very little drama and just 2 friends messing around with each other while having a great time. The friendship displayed here is carefully crafted, from an awkward introduction to assisting each other with their bikes and finally adventuring together, the progression of their relationship through the series is enjoyable and perfectly executed. There is a third girl who rides a bike and works at a cafe who shows up later in the show, she complements the cast well and helps Koguma become more of a senpai. These characters will likely interest you if you want to watch a more grounded friendship over a typical highly energetic and over the top anime friendship, it’s a slow burn but its realistic and feels heartwarming when the characters, especially Koguma, flash their smiles of satisfaction due to the fun they had.<br />
<br />
This review will not go very in depth into the sound design but will note the highlight points. The primary highlight points being that the bikes actually sound like bikes and sounds vary by terrain, the ambient sound effects for everything complements the lifelike animation style that was used for this anime very well and the OP along with ED were relatively decent. <br />
<br />
Overall, this anime is recommended if you’re a fan of the SOL niche or are interested in watching a realistic portrayal of girls motorbiking as a hobby, it has good production values and the cast is grounded well, there is nothing that really detracts from the show and it was most importantly very enjoyable to watch. In consideration of the niche this anime is focused on, points will not be deducted for a lack of a story or any significant themes, Supercub gets a solid 8/10 for delivering a relaxing and warm experience.<br />

    Had to revise my review because I dropped this show. It&#039;s not bad, it&#039;s just dull to me. There aren&#039;t really any characters. They exist, but they have no actual character, our protagonist is about as interesting as wood, and the fact that the show is just product placement is wearying after a while. <br />
<br />
Even in SoL and CGDCT shows, I think it&#039;s important to have, at the very least, characters whose personalities can interact with each other in an interesting way. These types of shows usually have stock characters, but they can often get away with it by being charming in the scenarios it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396086">
        creates for the characters to interact within, or the gags, if it&#039;s comedic. This show doesn&#039;t do either of those things, it has characters say things at each other instead of having conversations, and the scenarios are bland. For example, a significant plot point of episode 4 involves our main character, Koguma, figuring out that she won&#039;t get wet riding her bike in the rain if she wears rain gear. That&#039;s it, that&#039;s the plot. <br />
<br />
People compare this to Yuru Camp, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s very similar. Yuru Camp is very cartoony, and doesn&#039;t take itself very seriously. The way to deal with problems or camping tips in that show are displayed fairly quickly with humorous narration and on-screen reactions from characters, in a fourth wall breaking bit of fun. In super cub,  Koguma teachers herself to overcome problems, or someone tells her, and it takes about five minutes, or roughly 1/4th of the episode excluding OPs and EDs. It&#039;s presented dryly, in the stodgy manner of an employee training video. I can&#039;t help but wonder how much this show suffered in the &quot;fun&quot; department because it is a product ad, and Honda itself was involved. <br />
<br />
I&#039;d still watch this over most shonen anime about the super hero du jour, but I&#039;m not a fan. I won&#039;t finish it and I wouldn&#039;t recommend.

    Where can I start? First of all, i know this is not an action anime, there won&#039;t be murders, evils, etc., I knew this when I started it. <br />
The graphic is honestly beautiful, i like the animation and the art style.. but for me, the story is very boring. It&#039;s a chill anime, and I saw plenty of slice of life anime that were interesting, but this one didn’t pique my interest. <br />
The dialogues are monotonous and for some reason I don’t like our protagonist either. I will finish the anime tho, because i don&#039;t really like to stop watching an anime in the middle

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398918">
        of it.<br />
That&#039;s why I give this anime a 5 out of 10.

    *This review contains some spoilers*<br />
<br />
For the first time ever, I felt compelled to write a review for an anime that has just finished airing. For somebody like myself who just doesn&#039;t do this sort of thing, it speaks volumes to how either brilliant and memorable the experience was or the exact opposite, an incredibly off-putting and/or insulting viewing . Unfortunately, I am of the latter for this series. Super Cub. What I was initially hyped for turned out to be one of the most soulless watches I&#039;ve had, coupled with shameful advertisements of a product throughout the show.<br />
<br />
For a slice of life anime to really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404162">
        shine bright, IMO, it generally comes down to a couple of major things. That is the setting of the anime and especially the characters driving it. Super Cub failed pretty miserably in both these aspects. An insipid, uninspiring experience.<br />
<br />
Super Cub is set in some small bland rural town, actually no, that&#039;s not entirely right. Super Cub is set in some small bland rural town schools bike parking lot. That&#039;s better. I guess there are a few scenes where they show off the insane capabilities of the Super Cub whilst driving 35 mph through town (exciting) and even venture out further a couple times, but the vast majority of our viewing experience is severely limited to a minor few places where nothing interesting happens (her school, her home, etc). A rural setting can be great by the way, hell, I really enjoyed Non Non Biyori. That anime has a wonderful cast to compliment the setting though, and oh boy, we cannot say the same here. <br />
<br />
The main Female MC (Koguma) has to be one of the worst MCs I&#039;ve ever had the displeasure of watching. The &quot;story&quot; follows an independent (well, codependent with her stupid Cub later on, as she seemingly can&#039;t live properly without it) young Highschool girl who has no family or friends to speak of. She is very stoic and standoffish by nature, a girl of few words. The first few episodes  actually do a decent job in developing her character further as she meets her first real friend resulting in her slowly but surely breaking down her walls she&#039;s put up, but for some reason her personality and development stagnates and she continues to be this quite unpleasant, unfriendly person in the later episodes. There are scenes where you just want to scream at this moron for not understanding and acting accordingly to the situations that she&#039;s in (episode 11 for example where time is of the essence). And I&#039;ve heard the excuses to her actions &quot;oh, she&#039;s from a rural town, they aren&#039;t used to social interactions that much&quot;, lol I&#039;m from a rural town as well buddy, I can socialize just fine. Terrible scapegoat. If I&#039;m being honest, she comes across as mentally ill, but nothing of the sort is explored, her mind, her past, etc. Who the hell wants all that in a cutesy slice of life anyway? It would defeat the purpose entirely. <br />
<br />
Next we have Reiko, an energetic girl who befriends MC thanks to their mutual interest in riding Super Cubs. She just so happens to be extremely knowledgeable about all things bikes and teaches the MC the ways of the Cub. Best part of the anime right there, the little teacher/student thing they had going on, the small info dumps on how to clean/maintain your bike, the bike parts that came with it, the extra parts that were sought after etc. Pretty interesting overall, it did remind me of Yuru Camp (that&#039;s where the comparisons start and finish for me there lmao). To finish of the trio of young bike enthusiasts, we have Shii-chan who is sadly ultimately used as a plot device to further advertise the Cub. Scenes are set up in place for this entirely.  A cute shy girl who is relegated to play the damsel in distress trope. Very one dimensional and lacking in any originality whatsoever. <br />
<br />
The art was alright, different, but tolerable. Pretty bog standard for your anime in 2021. The color palette and character designs were ugly mind you. The sound was probably the best part of the anime, the OSTs fit very well with most situations and were generally very easy on the ears. A plus there.<br />
 <br />
And now to my main gripe with this show. There are examples of Honda&#039;s advertising throughout this series, it&#039;s not exactly difficult to notice. And it wears on you after the umpteenth time. Where it differs from other anime that advertise product is that it&#039;s much more &quot;in your face&quot; and with more frequency to boot. What I thought was truly the most shameful scene though was when MC&#039;s friend rides her push bike down some trail, slips and ends in a small stream/river and seemingly can&#039;t get up and calls MC to come get her. MC takes her sweet time and screws around with the poor girl, even slapping the crap outta her, finally chucks her in the front basket of the Super Cub (very dangerous) and drives off. A very idiotic scene that should have never happened in the first place, but it&#039;s the script that gets me the most...<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#039;t thank me, thank the Cub&quot; and other cheesy/horrible dialogue that went with it. &quot;My Super Cub is on it&#039;s way&quot; Oh, thank the Heavens and the Gods for the almighty Super Cub, hallelujah! What she&#039;s pretty much saying is &quot;this wouldn&#039;t have happened if you didn&#039;t have this amazing vehicle with you, idiot&quot;. I&#039;m surprised she never broke the 4th wall and literally told us, the viewers, to hurry up and go buy one already. They&#039;re only $2500 USD brand spanking new!!! You won&#039;t regret it!!! Shii Chan sure didn&#039;t, as expected, she bought one the next episode.<br />
<br />
Overall, a somber experience. One of the worst offenses an anime can make is to simply be boring. And that&#039;s what this is. If you&#039;re boring a massive slice of life fan, then something is wrong here. Couple it with the two paragraphs above and you have my least favorite anime of the season. <br />

    Looking for something to fill that Yuru Camp/Non-non Biyori sized hole in your heart? Look no further, Super Cub is your answer.<br />
<br />
Super Cub is not only arguably the best motor scooter ad ever made, it’s a damn good anime and is one of the hidden gems of a loaded season. I watch everything every season, so despite having no expectations for Super Cub, I went in with an open mind. From episode one, I was blown away by just how mesmerising this series is. It’s such a simple concept. Girl with no friends or family going through depression decides to try out a Super Cub

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404073">
        scooter. Falls in love with riding a scooter and uses it to explore her prefecture. Yet, Super Cub’s quality lies within its simplicity. Reiko’s inner development is paralleled by the literal development of her scooter. As it grows, so does she. It’s a really beautiful metaphor that keeps the show grounded, yet impactful. Just like Yuru Camp and other CGDCT shows, there’s not a whole lot of plot going on. While there are some recurring plot-lines, overall the series aims to showcase the characters’ development through their daily activities. This should not come as a surprise, as this is the CGDCT norm. <br />
<br />
I really was shocked by how much I came to like this show. While Yuru Camp interested me with camping and outdoors-y activities, I’m not a scooter or motorcycle person to really care about that. Yet, I found myself drawn to Super Cub due to its loveable characters and their growth. By 4-5 episodes in, I was really concerned for the MC and just wanted the best for her.<br />
<br />
One of the more interesting aspects of the show for me was the use of CGI. For a slice of life show, I thought the series relied a little heavily on it at times. For really simple shots like characters riding their scooters or even just walking around, the studio used CGI. Personally, I don’t think CGI ever looks good, so that’s one downside artistically. Other than that, I loved the art style and the more muted colour palette used by the studio. They make use of this as part of the narrative, by having the first episode start off really gray and then gradually adding more colours into subsequent episodes. A perfect example of colour as a storytelling technique as it reflects the MCs interior struggles. The character designs themselves are actually quite unique and I must say I like them quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake, while I used Yuru Camp as an introductory comparison, Super Cub is very much its own show, and one very much worth watching. If you enjoy slice of life or CGDCT shows, this is a must watch. It brings all the traditional aspects together in a rather unique way. Certainly one of the most memorable shows of Spring 2021. Super Cub gets 9 oil changes out of 10.

    Super Cub is an Honda advertisement effort to sell those shiny and useless motorcycles, and it does a good job about it! First of all, I&#039;m not being paid from Honda for this review, so I&#039;m going to be completely impartial about it. Honda is a great company and I have the most respect out of their employees, so if you work for Honda I tell you, have a good life.<br />
<br />
Now, going into the review, Super Cub features a glooming teenager called Koguma, whose life is as boring and middle of the pack as it can be. Koguma have no parents, money or friends at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404207">
        the start, which the later is not surprising at all because she probably have some high into the spectrum autism as we can see later in the series. Her life got better when she got her Super Cub, since her life could start to take some colour (Like literally, everytime they wanted to show us that she felt good they changed the colours. That gimmick was alright at the start, then it got annoying as fuck)<br />
<br />
The art of this anime is ok, the characters are somehow normal which I like, they look like they would be an extra in your favorite action anime, that&#039;s the point i guess. The CGI usage is somehow cheap, I have no problem with CGI honestly, the time reduction that it gives is extremely worth it so I have no desire to talk shit about it. The only problem is that it broke the continuity of the scene many times, since the models and the drawings didnt feature the same features (Like ground and shit, whatever). The music was alright too, the usage of classical music like the change of colors got old very fast for me, hearing i dont know who because im a shitty ignorant behind a motorcycle motor was extremely jarring too, but who cares <br />
<br />
The main problem of this anime is then the interactios between of characters. The plot, as it is a slice of life, shouldnt be an issue. Koguma travels, buys some dumbass equipment and then her life get better. Not something to worry about. The problem is then how those characters act besides the cubs. You have Reiko and Shii, the other two characters, and while Reiko is a charming and engaging characters that synchronize with the deep into the spectrum Koguma, I don&#039;t see the same in Shii. There is no reason for Shii to keep Koguma and Reiko near them, the purpose of her is to sell us the Cub, and then when she got introduced the ad levels of bullshit got so high that it was unbearable.<br />
<br />
In my honesty, Shii would have served better as a contraposition of Koguma and Reiko obsession, not as someone who wants to get into their own frequency. That way we would get out of the monotonous tone that this had. The problem is that she doesnt, and she doesnt because this is an ad. <br />
<br />
I won&#039;t say anything about episode 5 and 11 because they were clearly subject of brain damage writing<br />
<br />
That would be it. If you want something calm to watch, watch this. Skip episode 5 to not get mad because it is also almost pointless, and turn your brain off in episode 11 to have a better day. The only salvageable aspect of this is that it was a good ad, so I will give it a 4 out of 10 for the execution

    Wow I didn&#039;t expect this anime could be this interesting, but I&#039;m really pleasantly surprised, it&#039;s very calm and relaxing especially when Koguma smile, you really feel that she is very happy. Her background is kinda sad and strange (she&#039;s horphan and lives alone in a house, she says that she has no money, but this doesn&#039;t seems so real XD, or anyway not so precise)<br />
<br />
By the way I&#039;m really liking also the art, considering that this studio is kinda new, but frames are always full of details and this is something to consider.<br />
I also enjoyed a lot the fact that the grey tone is

        related to her emotion, in fact when she feels happy everything become saturated to express better how she feels :)

    Super Cub is an attempt at a coming of age story, but places too much damn emphasis on scooters.<br />
Before you come on my profile and say &quot;well dumb dumb, this show IS about scooters.&quot; Yes, true. but I really would like to know the main character a bit. Similar to Yuru Camp, there is a lot of emphasis on the &quot;activity&quot; being done, while characters get little to no development other than their base personality traits. <br />
In this case, I really would like to talk about Koguma, our protagonist. While it is true that she does change, make friends, and becomes more cheerful throughout the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411132">
        series, it does seem forced and less of import than the scooter itself. Rather than Koguma bettering herself, it seems like the scooter is the impetus for the changes that Koguma goes through. It&#039;s quite clear that her relationship with Reiko only happens because she owns a cub. It&#039;s quite sad to see that 12 episodes in, and the only things Reiko and Koguma talk about are still about scooters and cubs. <br />
There&#039;s so much emphasis on the cubs, but Koguma&#039;s character and personality do not really get a chance to shine. For a coming of age story, I really was not attached to Koguma in the least bit just due to the fact that there&#039;s basically nothing to get attached to. The beginning episode was quite strong. The beginning morning routine animation, the piano notes and the color tone change when she gets the bike. It&#039;s really well done actually, but that was basically the peak. The beginning of the anime clearly paints the picture that Koguma lives in slow-burning gloom with no direction in life, and the super cub gives way to a potential path towards making progress--finding something that you enjoy in life. <br />
It&#039;s a great setup, but sadly, the series does not deliver. Whether it be her summer job, or interactions with Reiko, or her relationship with Eniwa, it&#039;s all so surface level. It&#039;s not wrong to say that the actions that Koguma takes are ones that could be considered fulfilling in its slow paced fashion, but execution lacks in all departments. Reiko is a convenient supporting character in which Koguma takes no initiative to interact with herself, and that could be passable if their relationship was more than moving through the motions. Seriously, I never once thought that there was any genuine dialogue in any of the episodes. It&#039;s always, &quot;my cub is cool, let&#039;s talk about cubs!&quot; That&#039;s it. There&#039;s a serious scene about Eniwa getting saved by Koguma, and all Koguma can say is &quot;my super cub saved you, not me.&quot; Holy. Crap.<br />
Eniwa, Koguma, and Reiko all have super bland personalties, and I really do not have much of an impression of them at all. Eniwa--she&#039;s fine for how little screen time she has. In fact, she&#039;s probably the most diverse and well written character out of the three. But what about Koguma, the protagonist? Seriously. When all I can say about her is that she like her scooter, that&#039;s a huge problem. There&#039;s really nothing in the series about bettering her personal life, going through mental roadblocks, or just trying something beyond something relating to scooters. <br />
CGI is also well, bad. Which means that for half or more of the scooter scenes which are CGI, it looks kinda bad. Admittedly, the show does do a decent job of combining 2d and CGI together. There&#039;s definitely quite a lot of scenes where close ups of the faces and body of the characters in the scooters are animated by hand, but bad CGI is bad CGI.<br />
I just had no attachment to to any of the characters whatsoever, given how there is little liveliness in dialogue and most of the topics of conversation can be traced back to scooters. Koguma goes through the motions towards bettering herself, but you never really feel like she&#039;s improved by her own mettle. There&#039;s no self reflection that&#039;s particularly meaningful. If I didn&#039;t know better, this is just product placement for Honda super cubs.

    I have never seen an anime protagonist with no concrete goal to achieve. Usually, we see ones who have big dreams like becoming the pirate king, a hokage or even a simple one like trying to live peacefully. But never really did an anime present its mc as someone devoid of everything. Someone living her monotonic everyday life with no reason to try and do anything. Super Cub is the story of Koguma, a very simple girl trying to break out of her shell and add more color in her life. <br />
<br />
Koguma is a very timid girl. She is the type to eat cold food

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404151">
        instead of heating it in order to avoid interacting with anyone and getting hurt by it. Her monotonic life starts with her waking up, eating any food she bought beforehand, going to school and heading back home. She has been living like that for most of her life until one day she decided to break free. Acting on her desires for the first time in her life, she went and bought a super cub. A partner that will be with her throughout her journey and her very first friend. You could even call it her wings which she will now use to go out of her shell and do whatever she wants.  <br />
The characters in Super cub have been surprisingly great. Koguma is a very basic and timid girl yet surprisingly enough, it never gets boring watching her. The change of her character when it comes to riding her cub and how she takes care and treasures it is great. She is a simple girl yet that simplicity is the key to her charm. She doesn’t act on a lot of things but does her best when it comes to the things she treasures whether it be her cub and how she always does her best to fix it when it has an issue, or when treasuring her new friend Reiko, the one that helping her out and showing her how to care for her cub and how to enjoy her life. <br />
Reiko herself is a very sweet girl. She appears to be carefree but she is surprisingly a fighter. She doesn’t want to be shackled by anything and tries her best to destroy any wall standing her way no matter how impossible it may seem. She is a diligent and a stubborn girl who stands at nothing to achieve whatever she wants.<br />
The development the characters get is great specially when seeing Koguma trying to act more on what she wants and actually having a desire to do something like simply driving to another city to buy anything just because she can. <br />
Shii is the last MC tho she gets introduced later on. She is a hard-working little girl that tries to make herself happy and push herself more to achieve her goal. She is a source of posiitive energy and just looking at her makes you happy. She was the biggest reason Koguma started using her Cub and she is the one always pushing forward. A great character to complete the trio. <br />
<br />
Super cub had a lot of ideas that I thoroughly loved. First one that comes to mind is how it used a simple visual element like color to set the atmosphere for its characters. Koguma’s life is monotonic therefore her life is portrayed as a shade of grey. It is only when she is taking about her cub or riding it that her life becomes more colorful and it depicts the change in her emotions and mindset. The correct and precise usage of color at the perfect time sets the atmosphere so well and you could notice the change in Koguma’s life more as the anime goes on. <br />
The anime doesn’t have Shakespeare-level dialogue but it doesn’t need to. It doesn’t force conversations out of nowhere and even uses its lack of words to show the life of the characters. A great example of this was during the first 3 minutes or so of the first episode and how it didn’t have any dialogue which helped set the atmosphere of how sad and boring Koguma’s life has been up to that point. <br />
The last point that I really liked was the voice acting. The voice actors have been great. It is great seeing new voice actors at the scene and how refreshing it can be to hear someone new and how they use their voice and emotions to present what the characters are feeling. <br />
<br />
The soundtracks, sound directing and the animation have been great and the visuals are stunning to look at. I loved how it shows the beautiful scenery even during the moments when everything was grey from the perspective of Koguma. It really emphasized that beauty exists everywhere and we just need to break out of our mindset to see it and to understand how great life can be. Really hoping we call all do that. <br />
<br />
Super cub has been an anime that I really enjoyed and one that took my by surprise with how great it turned out to be. From what I thought was going to be a rip-off of Yuru Camp, turned out to be something that had a great unique story and value. It’s an anime that used its simplicity to highlight its charms and one that was able to make me relax even a bit during a really difficult time in my life. <br />
<br />
Overall, I would give Super cub an 8/10. I really enjoyed watching it and I loved how it was able to maintan consistency bar that one story in episode 11 which was handeled badly imo. <br />
Would recommend it to anyone searching for a relaxing SOL anime. <br />

    I liked the story very much because it entertaint while watching and even the quiet parts are quite interesting to me because it had a chill mood.<br />
<br />
The Art style is very unique and i like it very much.<br />
I think that they are CG while driving but it wasnt annoyingly noticable.<br />
The background is really beautiful too.<br />
<br />
The music at the beginning was very nice and fittet well to the beautiful background so it was really enjoyable.<br />
<br />
In this first episode the characters known are very likable and you can emphasize very good with the main character.<br />
The side character did a good support about things that the main character

As a result my enjoyment was very high and i liked the introduction of this anime really much.<br />
<br />
For me it is an overall 10 out of 10

    First of all I read the Manga and this is gonna be an absolute banger. This Anime is about a girl buying a Bike and finding her hapiness. Its really wholesome and interesting. This is definetly one of the best Anime this season.<br />
<br />
I hope everyone who reads this Review gives the Anime a chance. The main girl is really cute and the chracters are really deep. The main girl is so cute that i want to die and get isekaied into her world. I would even kill every person i know, just to go on a bike ride with her. The bike is also really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395340">

    Giving a preliminary score (let alone a review) is something I have always refrained from doing when judging anime/manga. But this... as a fervent enthusiast of the SoL genre, I just couldn&#039;t help myself with this one. This review is based on the first four episodes, and it will be updated when the series concludes.<br />
<br />
What an absolute hidden treasure this is. It is soft. Soothing. Mellow. Thoughtful, even.<br />
<br />
The art is stellar. The Cubs are amazingly detailed and the CGI blends well with its given setting. The utilization of colors to match the emotions of Koguma, the main character, breathes life in scenes that appear to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394996">
        be simple and mundane. The contrast between the muted color palettes and vibrancy when Koguma mounts her Cub for the first time, with her showing her cute, yet slightly broken smile as it marks the beginning of her life being filled with color... that cannot be explained with words alone.<br />
<br />
Interactions between Koguma and the other characters feel genuine, with Reiko in particular. The show nails the chemistry and the exchanges between extroverted and introverted characters. Nothing is being forced on to Koguma by Reiko, and the latter doesn&#039;t immediately jump at every opportunity to get in Koguma&#039;s face. Events flow smoothly from one to the next, and each of Koguma&#039;s milestones feels natural, like they aren&#039;t exaggerated in ways other anime would&#039;ve portrayed them to be. The minimal dialogue in scenes ironically adds more to their respective moments, and the show executes &quot;show, don&#039;t tell&quot; in a satisfactory manner. The thematic link between the growth of Koguma and her Super Cub is also a pleasure to watch. For each part that Koguma adds to her Cub, it also symbolizes the parts that she&#039;s steadily adding to her life. Her first time breaking away from the rigid tempo of home/school/sleep. Making her first friend. Finding her first job. It all ties in with Koguma&#039;s journey with her Cub.<br />
<br />
The sound, god the sound. The purring of the Super Cub fills my ears with contentment. The classical music that is injected with a tinge of melancholy and loneliness allows me to wind down as I watch Koguma ride her Cub. Even sound effects that would be typically ignored like the rice cooker in the background further adds into the atmosphere, which only gets me further invested into its world. The small things, when added up, builds themselves into something truly magnificent.<br />
<br />
Super Cub is nothing revolutionary, but for what it is trying to convey, it has achieved with flying colors thus far. It is crafted with love and the attention to detail it deserves, all while managing to stay unpretentious. Never would I have thought that this would be the series I&#039;d be looking forward to watch the most every week. A solid recommend that exceeded expectations.
