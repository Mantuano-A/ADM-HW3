    A mummy, an oni, a dragon, and a baku. Sounds like a recipe for a mess doesn&#039;t it? But rather it&#039;s the opposite. Despite the supernatural beasts that make up the main creatures of the show, the center of the show is down to earth, a love story between pet and owner.<br />
<br />
Each of the pet and owner pairs are helped by coming together and being with each other. In many cases the humans are able to grow by being with the pets and caring for them, and the same can be said about the animals. Whether they need someone to care for them or someone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275659">
        to be able to help the pets and humans work together very well and help make lasting bonds that extend farther than what many other shows are able to do with regular human characters. And keep in mind, these are pets. They can&#039;t talk, they can only emote and act. But still even in these actions they&#039;re able to express more of who they are, and the value of their bonds better than many shows that have the power of speech.<br />
<br />
Building off of that the interactions between all of the different characters are quite great. The friends act like good friends and seem to have a pleasant time bonding with each other. However as noted above the point where it truly shines is with the pets and the humans interacting with each other. There are so many light fluffy moments between them that are so charming to watch. And there is so much love between each pair in each of the things that they do.<br />
<br />
Mii and Sora exhibit this the strongest as each of their interactions with each other shows the dedication and love that they have for each other. Mii can&#039;t stand to be too long without Sora. Sora goes out of his way to do whatever he can for Mii, whether it be reading him a bedtime story, or finding the best food for him. I&#039;m sure many pet owners can relate with their own love towards their own pets. All of the fun ways that pets and their owners have to bond. The unique ways that you can support each other, without words yet exhibit that same love. That&#039;s what Miira is great at being able to show. They truly feel like important life partners. And they are. Because that&#039;s what pets are. Pets are magical and it certainly shows when watching Miira.<br />
<br />
The art and animation is also quite notable in my eyes. It&#039;s not special but it does a very good job of showcasing the cuteness of the supernatural creatures. Whether it be in the middle or end cards, or in the flowery flourish that accompanies a happy pet, it does well to soak in the cuteness and express the light jovial mood that the show often has. <br />
<br />
Even with all this fun and love there still are important meaningful parts. As I mentioned before the pets and humans really do help each other, and when the humans or pets backstories are gone into it&#039;s clear to see why the two are good fits for each other, and just how they&#039;re able to help. They&#039;re given actual flaws and issues, and in a show that could have just rested on it&#039;s good fluff it&#039;s great to see because it only enhances the message of the show, that is the power of pets. <br />
<br />
When I watch this show it makes me want to go give my doggies a big hug. And that&#039;s good, go find your pet and give them the love they deserve, and if you like pets, give this show a try, the creatures may be supernatural, but the love is just the same.

    Super adorable anime!!!!! I&#039;m so glad there is finally an anime adaption after waiting for two years since I started reading the manga on comico. All of the little creatures are so cute and it makes your heart melt, espeically Mii-kun and Isao. This anime is basically mini adventures of Sora and his friends. The plot is simple and starts with main character Sora receiving a package from his father. Inside is Mii-Kun!!! From there more characters are introduced with their partner creatures. The bonds between creature and their human companion is illustrated in this anime. We do get to see other unique creatures who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275580">
        live away from humans too and while it seems like a cheerful show, there are hints of a dark past that the creatures and characters go through. Sometimes seeing all the creatures reminds me of Studio Ghibli films. Artwork and music wise are ok, not my favorite but it&#039;s not bad either. <br />
<br />
Overall I liked this anime a lot! I&#039;ve been reading the manga since two years ago so I had read around 100 chapters, and this anime covered quite a lot. The characters are well developed and the pacing is fine. They did change the last two episodes though, so parts of the last episode are anime original. I think the finale would have been better if they had just adapted the manga and not include the original content. Either way most of the show is very relaxing and light hearted. Watch this if you want a SOL that is cute and overall relaxing. Most of the show is not in a school with those typical school events like the school festival, studying, etc. It&#039;s more about the little creatures and what they do outside of school. <br />
まだ最終話は見れていませんが、毎週とても可愛いミーくんたちに癒やされて、とても幸せでした！

    The season passed and this anime sadly got no hype whatsoever at any point, but damn I would be lying if I said I didn&#039;t love it! The easiest way to describe Miira no Kaikata is “diabetes bomb” and it&#039;s definitely one of the shows that made me smile the most of just how freaking adorable it can get. <br />
<br />
This anime starts with Sora, a boy who already got used to get dangerous things  from his adventurer dad, and the shock that his next surprise is not a mortal monster that should have been kept sealed instead of sent as a present to his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275606">
        son, but instead an absurdly cute and small mummy called Mii-kun that gets really affectionate to Sora, this is nothing but the start of his daily life with him around.<br />
<br />
But while being the main duo, they are just a part of a show with equally likeable characters (but they are not as cute as Mii-kun, sorry, the bar was too high), his childhood friend Kazuya might look scary to everyone, but he&#039;s actually really kindhearted, and there is also Motegi and Daichi, who got closer to them due to their own affection towards the mysterious pets they end up living with, finding that way friends to talk with about them, while Sora and Kazuya are the ones that mainly get protagonism, these two also have their very good moments, especially in their introductions, the show did a nice job at making me like them from the start.<br />
<br />
One thing I really liked of this anime is how as the episodes passed, we got to understand more and more Mii-kun and the other “pets” that appear during the series, what they like, why they do x things and act the way they do... all while having lots of scenes where we see them play around together, usually mixing Sora and friends for extra comedy, and especially smiles, I know I&#039;m repeating myself, but really, this show is adorable, their interactions are so heartwarming.<br />
<br />
The definitely weaker points of this anime were the artistic and music part, with none of the two passing the average at best, but that personally didn&#039;t affect my enjoyment towards the series. I don&#039;t go into this type of SoL shows expecting them to stand out in those aspects, if they are good and I also like the characters, even better, if not, it&#039;s totally fine, and in this case this anime did enough with that.<br />
<br />
Now that we reach the end of the review, I only have to ask a question left so you can confirm if you want to watch this show or not. Do you want to smile a lot and have a good time? If you do, start Miira no Kaikata, that&#039;s all!

    SoL-genre themed anime are the hottest trend in Winter 2018, and Miira no Kaikata is no exception: a sight of humans with critters as their individual and respective companions that fit well with them.<br />
<br />
What happens when your parents send you something from overseas that&#039;s an oddity? Well, prepare your hearts for Mii-kun the mummy that&#039;s cute and adorable as well as the other critters!<br />
<br />
The show does what is done best: cuteness overload bearing to the point that it&#039;s nice and smiles around to see the critters (Conny, Isao, Mukumuku) relating to Mii-kun, and not forgetting their owners too.<br />
<br />
It begins with Sora Kashiwagi, with his &quot;adventurer&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275631">
        tag of a father, sending him the mummy case, and as usual the oversized case hides the small adorable Mii-kun, which Sora got used to amidst the &quot;instruction manual&quot; that&#039;s attached to it.<br />
<br />
Then in comes Sora&#039;s best buddy, Tazuki Kamiya, with Conny, an oni child that&#039;s seems to be jealous and frustrated at its owner&#039;s actions, with Tazuki realizing Conny&#039;s plea and eventually comes to accept him wholeheartedly.<br />
<br />
One of their classmates, Asa Motegi, encounters Isao, a flying dragon (NOT lizard, which is her absolute fear) that like Mii-kun is able to understand what his owner is saying, but the dragon critter is probably the most shy one out of the rest for its inadequacy to react fast (e.g. *SPOILER ALERT* when Asa and Isao first met in her room).<br />
<br />
The weird person of the group, Daichi Tachiaki, a senior schoolmate, knocked out by the numerous bad dreams in his life during his sleep, Mukumuku is here to the rescue to suck up his negative energy despite its boisterous size. He&#039;s also the most uncanny person of the group, but does help occasionally for the group.<br />
<br />
And what better way to explain the whole synopsis with the great art and animation by 8-bit? Haven&#039;t seen such prowess at the studio for years gone by, but this really solidifies the studio as one of the greats when it comes to the SoL genre, so seeing this pop up with bright colours made to entice kids and people who love cute things definitely made our days.<br />
<br />
The sound too evokes cuteness, yet nice and good-hearing tunes to listen to. I will admit the sound department in this show isn&#039;t the strongest, but both the OP and ED really gave the show it&#039;s appeal IMO, so much so that it&#039;s a good hear, just not a great one by any means.<br />
<br />
Overall, I really felt that I enjoyed this hidden gem of a show that not many people are wiling to take a shot to try out. Heck, now that the anime&#039;s finished, I recommend you peeps to try it out and be pleasantly surprised by it, just no expectations please!

    In short, this anime is very thin even for a SoL anime. That thin characteristic can be felt almost in all aspects, but for the story and characterization aspects will get better in the latter part of this anime. This anime, for sure, has its own strong point to please the viewers : pets that are cute. This is the breakdown for the review :<br />
<br />
Story 3/10<br />
<br />
The story part is very simplistic. As SoL anime, usually simplistic story gives relaxing feels to the viewer. But at the earlier part, this anime’s story is overly simplistic and can be said as “narrow” and “shallow”.  And those

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274279">
        characteristics can’t be used as an execuse even for SoL anime. Fortunately this will get better in the half-end of the story as it’ll get deeper about some other themes, such as “relation” and “maturation”.<br />
<br />
This anime has supernatural genre attached to it, but mostly, it’s only attached to it. There are too few supernatural part in this anime, save for a very few episodes that have story around supernatural environment. Oh, and the pets themselves. They are supernatural beings but don’t feel like one.<br />
<br />
Art 5/10<br />
<br />
The chara design for this anime is that of average, except for the pets which is cute. Really, the pets design are cute and simple, which makes it possible to be animated fluidly. For the human characters, the most noticable part of the chara design is their hair. Those hair styles and colours are what you expect to find in many average shounen animanga. <br />
<br />
Even though the design is that of a shounen, it’s character animation (which i define as “movement”) is nothing shounen-ic at all. It’s more of a shoujo-ic movement actually, as we can see from the male characters gesture. This is more appearent in the ED song which all of the big characaters dance like a girl-band. This discrepancy between character design and the style of movement gives feel that either of those two fit with the anime as a whole.<br />
<br />
There are many different backgrounds for sure, but not that many. Most of them are just simply a wall or very common buildings. This kind of background doesnt give anything into the viewers’ eyes, except “oh, there’s a background”. That, combined with the lack of fluid animation from the human characters gives feels that there is almost nothing notable about this anime’s art. Except for the pets, that is.<br />
<br />
Sounds 4/10<br />
<br />
First, it’s about the seiyuus.....and there’s not much to talk about except, it’s done rather decently. The seiyuus gave a voice that quite befitting each character in this anime, but nothing is particularly good. We can only tell that “this character might sound like this”, but we cannot tell what kind of person this character is just by hearing its voice. <br />
<br />
The BGM also doesnt sound particularly good. It just there, but very likely viewers won’t take notice of it. The OP song is that your average anime’s opening. The ED, however, is quite well done...for the animation part. The songs and music are just there, but not giving any amplification for the anime as a whole.<br />
<br />
Long to short, for the sound aspect, here’s a statement that i feel can represent it : quite lively outside, quite lifeless inside.<br />
<br />
Character 5/10<br />
<br />
The characterization in this anime isn’t that strong. It affects the story but for a moment. Some may say that the characterization is very simple, altough others may say it’s very predictable and boring. I saw that both of them were true, but the latter one overshadows the first.<br />
There is character development in this anime. It’s not dramatic development, but this is SoL anime and that kind of development is kind of norm for this genre. For the earlier part of the anime, the character development can’t be felt except very faintly. But it gets better in the latter part.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 6/10<br />
<br />
The main strong point that this anime has....is the enjoyment. This enjoyment mainly can be gotten from watching the pets. They act very cutely. Add their simplistic design and moderate fluidity, the viewers will want more and more to see these pets. <br />
Light comedy is also that makes this anime enjoyable. Note that the comedy itself is pretty classic for anime’s joke. For some people, this kind of joke may feel bland. But nevertheless, this anime has comedy. The comedy exist and some of them may make the viewers smile despite feeling bland for the most part.<br />
<br />
Overall 4,6 to 5 /10 <br />
<br />
Overall, this anime is very thin, narrow and shallow – even for SoL anime. It gets better with the latter part, around the second half of the 12 episodes, but there’s still almost nothing in this anime. Except for pets. The cuteness of the pets is what makes this anime may worth to watch. Maybe. Try it yourself and decide whether it suits your taste or not :)<br />

    Story: 7/10<br />
The main protagonist, Sora, always receives dangerous things from his father in Egypt, but this time, it&#039;s the opposite? I might be biased, because this anime is so adorable, so you might wanna keep the ambulance on dial. It&#039;s a new concept and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve heard of any anime like this. <br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
I guess everything is adorable, even the things you should find scary is suddenly cute.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
Unique and adorable characters. But of course, the main character is always that person who is so selfless and does everything by himself. Sora is adorable and so kind but it annoys me. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall: 8/10<br />
How

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275625">
        many times have I said cute or adorable? It&#039;s too, too adorable, I can&#039;t handle it, haha. It&#039;s definitely an anime you should. Especially if you want to relax or need healing after life gives you a punch.

    There&#039;s honestly nothing extremely remarkable about this, yet it&#039;s pretty good. If you&#039;re here after watching Gakuen Babysitters (believe me, I was in the same boat) then stick around for this. <br />
<br />
To begin with, the story is nothing special. It&#039;s about a boy in a world with magical creatures and him and his friends have them as pets. That&#039;s literally it. There&#039;s tons of plot holes and unexplained phenomena and strange shit going on, but I tried by best to ignore all of that because of the sole reason that it&#039;s cute enough at times for me to enjoy that instead of complain. But sadly,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review286126">
        since plot kinda matters to me most of the time (unless the other elements are that overpowering) I kept thinking about the problems the story had instead of enjoying it. Perhaps that&#039;s a mistake on my own part. <br />
<br />
The art is pretty simple, nothing special. In episode 8, there are a few creatures that are animated very well and the art is pretty cool, but other than that, everything is pretty flat and simple. <br />
<br />
The opening and closing are both wholesome, but far too happy and cutesy for me to like them all that much. The voicing for the characters was alright, but I mostly really loved the sound effects and the noises from Mii and the other cute pets. <br />
<br />
Overall, for character, there was nothing all that remarkable. I can barely remember the name of the main characters, and I just binged it before writing this review. I have to say that I like Tazuki tho... he&#039;s just my type :D Unfortunately, there&#039;s not really any character development for anybody but him-- not that I was expecting a mummy to have character development. <br />
<br />
Now down to the general opinion about the show. All in all, I watched this for two reasons: 1) because I am a hardcore fan of Gakuen Babysitters, and 2) because I adore mummies... they simply just fascinate me. However, for people who are here for any of these two reasons, I have to tell you this: if you&#039;re here because you liked Gakuen Babysitters, there&#039;s still a chance you may dislike this. What sets Gakuen apart is the fact that it&#039;s about family connections and babies growing up, simply put. With Miira no Kaikata, the part of the show that was focused on togetherness and cuteness changes focus to mythical creatures predominantly. While there were some cute moments, I really didn&#039;t have as much of a reaction as I did to Gakuen.... it just wasn&#039;t cute enough for me. Perhaps it&#039;s because I&#039;m not an animal person? I&#039;m definitely a baby person. As for everyone who&#039;s here for liking mummies: honestly, just get out. It&#039;s got nothing to do with legitimate mummies. Enough said. <br />
<br />
I would recommend this if you: are an animal person, like shows about mythical creatures, like shows about pets<br />
<br />
I would NOT recommend this if you: are expecting as much cuteness as Gakuen Babysitters, don&#039;t like animals, can&#039;t stand plot holes<br />
<br />
Have a great day everyone!

    Miira no Kaikata is one of SOL genre anime that seems appealing and makes it self unique from other SOL though the idea of SOL anime is just basically a slice of life from the character in the anime. However the composition in this anime is interesting. Where there are superstitious creature but it is portrayed as a very cute lovable character, a mini mummy, a mini oni, a small baby dragon, and a fluffy baku. Okay here I go with the review,<br />
<br />
(Some spoilers ahead)<br />
Story: 7 <br />
I would say the story was well oriented, where like 3 of the episode are dedicates to the 3

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419809">
        supporting characters where as well it was introduced a new creature as well. Such as Tazuki and oni, Motegi and Isao, and Daichi and Mukumuku. However I think part of the story aren&#039;t really interesting well I mean it is a SOL genre anime, but it just seems was not enough.  But i do find some of the backstory interesting and heart warming. The ending of this anime was quite boring.. Unfortunately for me, I kind of expected a one of those cliche ending where they gathered together and cut scene it in there. But it ended with a scene of Mii Kun and Sora doing chores. Well in conclusion, It is I guess a well decent story not too good nor too bad, it was just good. <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The art of this anime is great and is consistent, it has this light touch to the anime where it brings out its heart warming animation to the viewer. The character design are wholesome as well such as Mii Kun and the others. Some of the scenery are well drawn and portrayed that seems appealing. I can&#039;t say much with the art but the point is that in my opinion it has a very good animation in relate to the genre SOL.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7.5 <br />
I&#039;ll be scoring the sound based on the OST such as OP ED and the BGM from some of the scene in the anime, as well as the seiyuus for the character. Overall I really like the choice of the seiyuu and fits each character well and gives each characteristic for each character. And the cute sound for the superstitious creatur sound are just soo adorable especially Mii Kun, I mean even if its just a small cute tiny bark it makes Mii Kun looks and sound 100x cuter and loveable! The OP and ED are nice, light hearted kind of catchy but I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s soo good or so. However the OST for the BGM for some of the scene in the anime complies the scene very well and makes some of the scene touching, joyful, etc. <br />
<br />
Character: 8 <br />
The characters are the one who made me interested in watching. There aren&#039;t much character development that seems appealing, however I think what makes this anime stands out with its character, it is obviously the cute behavior of this ancient legend superstitious creature that are portrayed as so cute and loveable. Where each of the main 4 creature has its own unique appealing behavior. Sora, Tazuki, Motegi, and Daichi are also well portrayed character, however I paid more attention to Mii Kun, haha.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
I&#039;ll just keep it short, of course I enjoyed watching this anime very much. It just feels that this anime lighten up my burden, my mood. Just to take a brief moment to just relax and enjoy this cuteness. You just can&#039;t go wrong watching this anime in context of enjoying it, of course you&#039;ll enjoy watching it. As well it gives you small giggles and joy while watching this since how cute, wholesome, and adorable they are.<br />
<br />
Dakara, this anime got 8/10, thanks to Mii Kun for bringing laughter and joy. And I think I used the word cute too many time lol, tho it is a very cute anime

    It&#039;s about a little mummy that is super cute and his adventures. The story is relaxing and constantly brings a smile to your face or a laugh at certain moments. It&#039;s kinda slow but is just barely enough to keep up your interest in it.<br />
<br />
In each of the episodes the protagonist makes new friends and their guardians discover new things. Fantasy creatures are abound which makes for a good watch specially for kids. There is an underlying threat that is constantly looming above them which is revealed towards the last few episodes. Other hidden themes are of losing someone, understanding relationships and the cruelty of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306294">
        humans towards animals or creatures.<br />
<br />
Overall, a nice anime to watch if you want something slow paced and hilariously cute!

    The story seemed very simple in the beginning. A young boy receives a Mummy from his traveling father and he tried to understand him. However the more we progress through the series the more knowledge we gain about what kind of world they live in. Where some people are aware of the existence of super natural beings (Mummy&#039;s, Oni&#039;s, Dragons, Gods, etc) and some people are not aware. Add in the relationship building between these creatures and their human partners we learn about each characters backstory, both the good and the bad <br />
finally there are some ominous moments throughout this anime which made me question

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275750">
        &quot;Is this show going to take a serious turn?&quot; That is something I will keep...Under WRAPS! (get it?)<br />
<br />
The art and animation wasn&#039;t anything too grand. However the coloring in Kaede&#039;s hair was superb. <br />
<br />
I really enjoyed everything sound wise in this anime. The opening and ending were really fun and the bgm throughout the show was fantastic. However the noises the Creatures made were amazingly good! Especially Mii-Kun&#039;s &quot;Woofs&quot; Super adorable!<br />
<br />
The characters were very interesting. Each seemed to have some kind of advanced skill which was never really mentioned throughout the series. Their backstories were really eye opening and inspirational as well.<br />
<br />
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. It had a great balance of Funny, Serious, Cute and Sad moments. A very well balanced anime I feel can make it way better.<br />
<br />
Overall I think this anime is not for everyone. I feel as though some people would consider it slow, or that the story is not there, or that it is overly cute. However I think this show should be watched at least once by every anime fan.

    To begin this review I want to point out that this show show be watched purely for the sake of enjoyment. No real over-analyzing or absurd theories, just watch it and enjoy.<br />
<br />
Story - 8: I wanted to give the story a 10 because of how much I thoroughly enjoyed the show, but here&#039;s the thing, this show has no real story in terms of beginning, middle, end, so I gave it an 8. The story is that Sora was sent a living mummy child (Mii) by his father who is a self-proclaimed adventurer and the series follows around their life together as Sora raises Mii

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277449">
        and learns more about him while the people who become closest to him also get their own fantasy creature companions (an Oni child, a dragon, and a baku) and shenanigans ensue. The true enjoyment of this show comes from just how adorable every creature (and even the people) are and how you just want to hug hold, play with and adopt every one of them. So despite the lack of a true story, this is a show that I could watch endless seasons of because I just want to see this gang of misfits.<br />
<br />
Art - 10: Very straightforward, the art is clean and crisp, the colors are vivid, and the animation is solid (so solid that I chose this show to be my test subject for learning to make gifs in Photoshop).<br />
<br />
Character - 10: If I haven&#039;t said this in any of my other reviews, I NEED character development. While I won&#039;t count conquering a fear of lizards or finally getting a good night&#039;s rest as character development, the real development lies within the two main human characters (Sora and Tazuki) and their creatures (Mii and Conny). While even their character development may not be considered the most complex of all time, it does happen in a very appropriate way: all of the characters begin as very well-rounded people, but who they are as people is slowly unraveled to you and as you learn more about what makes them rough around the edges, they learn how to move beyond those traits.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10: This is the real meat of this review. This show is disgustingly cute and I loved every minute of it. Mii literally doesn&#039;t talk, he just barks and cries and I want one (why only one? because I wouldn&#039;t want any others thinking they weren&#039;t getting attention). Whenever Mii cries, I cry (which is every episode) and it just makes me want to hug him, thankfully Sora is an angel and will take care of him to his dying breath. Conny is a brat and goes perfectly with the too-cool-for-school Tazuki. Isao is a good boy and a perfect big brother to all of the creatures and is even more responsible than his precious human counterpart, Motegi. and just overall the cast is lovable.<br />
<br />
Overall - 10: TL;DR SOMEONE GIVETHAT MUMMY A HUG. For a show with no overall story other than the life of these humans and their mythical pets, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve been this attached to a show in a while (That&#039;s a lie because BNHA exists) and am so ready and willing to throw my money out the window just to get a life-sized Mii plushie.

    I started watching this anime for how cute and sweet it looked and I wasn&#039;t disappointed but I certainly stayed for the characters and story especially towards the end. The first few episodes are definitely what I expected going into it. They were simple, one-off style episodes that makes the anime feel like you could stop and pick it back up at any time but by episode 6 I found myself more invested in the characters and their stories. Each of the pets have a certain personality and relationship with their owners. Tazuki and Sora have a backstory that keeps you interested and the hints

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277436">
        that are left for some of the later plot points makes you want to finish it. <br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
I enjoyed the way a major plot was sprinkled in throughout the show but I felt like that left it for a lot of loose ends. There are too many questions left open for my liking which might be answered in the manga but I haven&#039;t read it yet. Parts of the story ended up feeling rushed towards the end because it started off with one-off stories. While I enjoyed it, the series left me with more questions than it answered.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
This show excelled in having these cute mythical creatures have personality through their look. Even the way they moved you could tell their personalities. I also think it did a good job using visuals to convey what they were feeling since the 4 main creatures didn&#039;t talk. Where the show fell short was with its human characters. They seemed a bit stiff and at some points, they were too simple for my liking<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
The soundtrack kept the mood of the show flowing but honestly, I didn&#039;t notice it too much. <br />
<br />
Characters: 9/10<br />
The thing this show did the best was keeping you interested in the characters. Not only was each character loveable but they were expanded on. They got some sort of backstory as well as development. Even the creatures ended up having personalities even without speech. The relationships also shined both between the humans and their pets but also between all the creatures and all the humans.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
This show is made to make you smile. You can sit back and enjoy this show easily. Its fun and sweet and even if you aren&#039;t too interested in the story you can find enjoyment through the cute interactions and sweet personalities of the characters.

    Miira no Kaikata starts off very questionably I&#039;d say. After making his aunt a nightly snack, our main protagonist, the laundry boy Kashiwagi receives a package and thrown off by the fact that all the packages from his dad were and most likely will be scary to the point where he&#039;ll be questioning whether or not to open them, he decides to just stay still while the most adorable thing walks out of it -<br />
Mii-kun!<br />
<br />
From then on the anime is very wholesome and continues to be like it for the rest of the series. It has some very &#039;moe&#039; moments and it&#039;s great. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story; 8/10<br />
<br />
Nothing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321728">
        is really going on in the first few episodes, MC and his childhood friend get their partners, MC accepts Mii-kun with open arms but the other one is a bit reluctant about it. They meet some friends and whatnot, they meet up and hang out. Overall the story isn&#039;t that much important, the real matter of importance is the humor and the glorious cute moments this show has. It&#039;s also fast-paced which is a plus for me.<br />
<br />
Characters; 8/10<br />
<br />
Not much is explored but the friendship between our MC and his childhood friend Tazuki deepens throughout various episodes. The other two, Asa and Taichi are there just because, but it&#039;s okay because the anime makes up for it, in a way that makes you look at them in a whole different light. It includes them in various moments that would&#039;ve been impossible to achieve without them. The side characters receive a bit of development too. So overall, some of the characters develop, some don&#039;t, it&#039;s average, but considering this wasn&#039;t the main point of the show, I enjoyed it a lot.<br />
<br />
Art; 9/10<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t possibly explain how much I love this art style in anime. It makes the characters look cute and possibly more friendly then they could be. Transitions between images looked smooth as well.<br />
<br />
Sound; 7/10<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t really notice the sound as much as, let&#039;s say the OP. The opening of the series is great, upbeat just like some of the episodes and fits the series completely.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; Overall; 9/10<br />
<br />
I really liked this show as I said before, although it&#039;s a shame that it didn&#039;t receive any popularity ever since it began. Moe shows like this should be celebrated in my opinion. If you like cute, wholesome anime then I recommend you watch it.<br />

    To be honest, after reading the summary of this show, I was eager to watch it. The first few episodes were quite alright, simple slice of life with a dash of supernatural cuteness. Standard stuff. But as more episodes followed... I recognized this main problem with this series - the lack of direction. The premise is good, this idea that there are some supernatural beings surrounding us at every corner, wherever we go, but just because we&#039;re not aware of their existence, we don&#039;t notice them. A bit similar to how muggles don&#039;t notice wizards and witches because they don&#039;t know about magic. I&#039;ll try

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314201">
        not to spoil too much saying this... But the logic is lost quite quickly and the moral compass of the main protagonists is off the rails soon after as well. After finishing the last episode I was left with a lot of unanswered questions which gave way to even more questions. To be frank, I wish there were more episodes to this anime. I haven&#039;t read the manga yet, but if even the manga lacks all of the answers then I think the main problem is the story/writing itself. And that&#039;s not good. I like the cute mascot that Mii-kun is, but my &quot;adult brain&quot; just can&#039;t handle the lack of logic this anime is presenting. I really hope it&#039;s just because this is directed to a younger audience and not because the author of the source material is not the best of story writers.

    How to Keep a Mummy is a hard anime to rate because, when you think hard enough about the show, not much happens during its 12 episode run. The show&#039;s main pull is just how adorable Mii-kun and the rest of the fantasy creatures that appear in the series are doing totally mundane things. The only plot the show has is a handful of mystery-themed episodes where the main cast stumbles upon some element of Japanese mythology with its cuteness factor dialed up to 11.<br />
<br />
That said, while you could argue that the story doesn&#039;t have much going for it, the show is a constant onslaught

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277159">
        of cuteness and it knows it. How to Keep a Mummy ends up feeling like the supernatural equivalent of watching a ton of baby animal videos - nobody is watching this show for the sake of the plot. My friend Ali and I watched this together and pretty much spent the entire run of the anime cooing and squealing like it was the first day with a newly adopted puppy.<br />
<br />
You&#039;ll be able to tell if How to Keep a Mummy is for you from the first ten minutes. If you think Mii-kun is adorable and enjoy his adorable antics, you&#039;ll like the show. If you don&#039;t, you won&#039;t, and also you have no soul. <br />
<br />
Seriously, look at how cute this mummy is!

    Hey folks, this will be a review for Miira no Kaikata. Have you ever heard someone say something was so sweet that it gave them diabetes? Well this show might actually be sweet enough to do that.<br />
<br />
The story revolves around a group of kids from high school who have this ability to see special creatures. Each character has their own creature that they take care of and they spend their days living their lives with them.<br />
<br />
The art was fitting and the soundtrack and VA was great. <br />
<br />
The characters are a great part of the show. Each one has their own personality but they have a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277173">
        good group dynamic and don&#039;t feel like they are overshadowed by another. To add on to that, they each are joined by a creature which has their own personality. <br />
<br />
However with all that being said this show isn&#039;t about the story, the characters, or anything else really. Its just to enjoy. The show is remarkably cute. I&#039;ve never been a huge fan of shows that straight up aim for the &quot;aww effect&quot; but this one seems well done. The creatures feel real and don&#039;t feel like mascots thrown at you to sell something. The show is slow paced and is gentle to watch, but doesn&#039;t become boring or tedious. They try to spice up the ending side of the show which was unnecessary. The world building also has some questionable elements, but again it doesn&#039;t matter.<br />
<br />
If you like shows with plots, or some manner of reasoning to their actions this isn&#039;t for you. However if you want something to relax and let yourself go into this is a great show.

    I&#039;ll start saying that Miira no Kaikata (translated to &quot;How to Keep a Mummy&quot;) was easily the biggest surprise of the winter season.<br />
<br />
It follows Sora, a high school student who is always gifted with weird supernatural stuff (that usually hurts or curses him) from his father. Nonetheless, one day, he is sent a tiny mummy, whom he starts raising both as a pet and a son. <br />
<br />
This mummy is the main reason I absolutely loved this anime. It doesn&#039;t talk, it thinks like a 4-year old... But it&#039;s one of the most cute and funny creatures that had appeared in an anime. It&#039;s hard not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277589">
        to smile while watching Mii-kun&#039;s reactions to the world. <br />
<br />
As the anime keeps going, new characters are introduced, as well as new creatures. And everyone gets along so well, in a way that you don&#039;t feel any forced humor, feelings, or cuteness. The key here is naturality, since everything flows perfectly fine.<br />
<br />
There is not much to talk about the story since it&#039;s a simple SoL. Some flashbacks about the protagonists are shown to explain short problems that appear during the episodes. <br />
<br />
The art and sound are not memorable (Except for the creatures&#039; design), but far from bad. It fits with the simplicity this series aimed to.<br />
<br />
Overall, it can be described with one word: Simple. And that same simplicity allows you to feel what the characters feel and cheer for every little adversity Mii-kun and the others try to get over, be it missing someone, or trying to make sushi.

    Yes, this anime is cute, but it’s more than that. I know being cute is enough to pull people in by itself, but I’ll try to convey how pleasantly surprised I was when I started watching this small show that almost nobody is talking about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Miira no Kaikata is best described as a Slice-of-Life, although the circumstances aren’t very close to normal life, at least at first. Kashiwagi Sora, our protagonist, gets sent a miniature mummy in the mail by his father, and after some thought, decides to care for it. And the anime is just this concept, although expanding by adding more characters, both human

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275744">
        and not. <br />
<br />
Most of the so-called “arcs” of this anime aren’t that substantial. Though, maybe it’s expected considering the primary genre is Slice-of-Life. The cast goes through a few basic situations and gags, and whilst the story likes to get serious from time to time, it’s never too dramatic, and it mostly leads things to return to the status quo, plus some character development. If you’re looking for shows with strong and complex stories, then don’t watch this. It’ll only disappoint you.<br />
<br />
One aspect about the storytelling I want to highlight is how the supernatural pets are parallels to children, and the owners parallel parents. I know, drawing a connection between pets and children isn’t very difficult, considering how some people think these two might as well be the same thing. However, the way the anime showcases Mii-kun’s (The mummy’s) cute bumbling and curiosity, how among all the pets, they all gained different roles, and how it almost feels like the humans are competing on who has the best child, this coming up when one of them learns how to write. There are other examples, but I won’t get into them too much here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
As expected of a lighthearted show, Miira no Kaikata has a very pleasant cast that rarely fight and relish in pleasantries. I swear, too much of this show’s dialogue is pleasantries… Anyways, where was I? <br />
<br />
The human characters, being the previously mentioned MC Kashiwagi, his best friend Kamiya, their classmate Motegi, and finally another student, Takechi, are all decent characters, although nothing special. However, one aspect I enjoy how each of these four gaining a supernatural animal as a pet helps them get through a personal problem, whether it’d be Kamiya inability to show affection, Motegi’s irrational fear of lizards, or Takechi’s constant nightmares. How these characters get over these hang-ups, I won’t spoil. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, the pets are just adorable. They have their own moments of character, of course, and their bonds with their owners feel surprisingly genuine. Mii-kun is probably the most adorable thing I’ve ever witnessed in anime, and it’s the biggest highlight of the show in cuteness. The child-demon Conny and dragon Isao are both cute as well. Mukumuku, the sleep-eating Baku, I would’ve liked to see more of, since all it did throughout the show was teleport around, pretty much. Still though, the pets are the core of the show, so if you don’t like cute animals (IF you don’t, what’s wrong with you?), then this anime certainly won’t please you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Animation and Sound:<br />
If I had to pick out the biggest weakness of Miira no Kaikata, it’d be the animation. Whilst every scene with the pets is made with delicate details to make it extra-adorable, I can’t say the same for everything else. It’s passable, but there won’t be any moments where you’re mind-blown by the animation. <br />
<br />
Sound, on the other hand, has me conflicted. In terms of voice acting, the humans don’t have anything great going on. Again, it’s passable. However, once again the pets come in to save the day, as their signature small noises do what they need to do. They’re frickin’ adorable, of course. Especially Mii-kun’s voice. I can’t get enough of it.<br />
<br />
The same level of confliction happens when discussing music. The background music is very basic and uninteresting, couldn’t remember a single track if my life depended on it. The opening and ending, though, both have great songs. Oh, and the animation accompanying both of these are the same quality as everywhere else, but still, once again, does its job by being cute.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
If you couldn’t tell, I loved this anime for its pleasant atmosphere. Although, I have to say that the big thing that separates Miira no Kaikata from other “just cute” shows is that it doesn’t feel like it is just cute. All the cuteness in the show isn’t shoved in your face as it would be elsewhere. That, and this anime was clever by having the sound effects of the pets add to the whole experience. <br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
As a whole, if I had to describe this anime in only a couple of words, it’d be “Big-hearted”. The characters are enjoyable, the interactions between the owners and pets are heartwarming, the gags and the adorable bumbling are beyond enjoyable, and nothing that I’ve really seen to this capacity anywhere else. And again, the cuteness isn’t shoved in your face.<br />
<br />
Does the anime have problems? Of course. The story is inconsequential, the writing can get pretty damn generic, and the production values are not noteworthy. But goddamn it, this show gives so much with so little. The heart of this anime is so big that I can’t even describe it. I was just in a great mood whenever I was watching it. <br />
<br />
I definitely recommend this to anyone who’s a fan of Slice-of-Life or cute animals. If you love both, then nothing can go wrong, really. For the rest of you, I’d say to at least check it out, but be wary of the fact that I may just love it too much for personal reasons. But really, more people need to know this anime’s existence. It’s a bundle of adorableness that this medium is known to be great at, and it deserves more love.<br />
<br />
Final score: 8<br />

This anime was probably one of those that had less hype going on, which is kinda sad to be honest..... It was definitely in my Top 3 this season and i loved it! I&#039;ve seen a lot of people saying that it was adorable and stuff, but for me it had a rather heart-warming effect. It brought a warmth to my heart every damn episode, which i loved too.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
Filled with adorable creatures, that aren&#039;t really noticed by people in the modern world/society, with most based off Japanese culture; gods, yokai, kemono etc. (i dont really know how many are there) + those like the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275761">
        mummy from egypt and dragon from idk what mythology, &#039;cuz there&#039;s bound to be one at least in one and every (almost). Centering around 4 main characters with their &#039;monster&#039; and how they got to meet them as well as developing everyone&#039;s personality and showing them themselves in seperate episodes and all of this in 12 episodes is for me a rare occurrence. I really enjoyed this and still can&#039;t believe such a good show just ended TnT<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
Both art and animation was beautiful. I likes how their eyes where blured uner their hair and even though the art-style wasn&#039;t that special, it was pleasant to my eye. I enjoyed the way animators portrayed Mii-kun&#039;s emotions and how lovely he was drawn (except a few shots TuT). Overall i think it was done well :&#039;)<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
I REALLY enjoyed both OP and ED, which i even now watched just for the sake of staying in this great mood the anime has set for me &lt;3 OST was okay and the voice actors were great choices too :&#039;3<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
Not much to say here. They were all awesome. I liked the idea of the &#039;monsters&#039; staying at some of the MCs&#039; houses because they either couldn&#039;t survive otherwise or the fact that MCs needed help. There was variety of characters to get to know and they all had different personalities, different backstories and their own troubles. I couldn&#039;t get enought of either and aaaaa this anime is just so nice <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
if i still haven&#039;t convinced you to go and watch this god-damned good anime then idk how anymore x&#039;D I loved the series and its plot. Really, if you have free time, go watch it :&#039;D<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
I wish there were more cute-fun-hidden meaning anime that just let&#039;s you be sucked into its world &#039;cuz i don&#039;t know what to compare it to anymore..... I saw a few peeps comparing it to Gakouen Babysitter or whatever its called but honestly...... It wasn&#039;t it for me..... This show is a great one, it&#039;s a lot of fun and i couldn&#039;t wait every week for new episode to get released...... wish it came out on Netflix instead of the crap Sword Gai pulled...... Go read manga if you can &#039;cuz the anime isn&#039;t THAT great... But. This isn&#039;t a review about that, it&#039;s about the good show. Miir no Kaikata will stay as one of my favourites, especially in EDs.<br />
<br />
Well... Gotta go draw a few &#039;lil monsters ;&#039;D<br />

    How to Keep a Mummy is a pleasant surprise that captures your heart with adorableness as a mostly slice of life meets supernatural pets. <br />
<br />
Overall I find the story pleasant because of the genre, so each episode is kind of a day to day life scenario. There are some moments that end up a little wacky and sudden because there are some serious moments that show up and near the end characters suddenly receive a bunch of quirky traits to progress the plot. And you can definitely feel emotional from them because you grow quite attached to everyone. But I can kind of roll with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277057">
        it because that&#039;s the feeling of the show. <br />
<br />
Despite some quality issues as we all can recognize at times, this art style and color palette are very effective at communicating cute adorable motions. And for Mii a lot of effort goes in and shows with his cute sound effects. Sound effects are the biggest detail that really works well for the whole production! <br />
<br />
I wasn&#039;t particularly impressed with the whole cast as they are a mash of many tropes but I don&#039;t dislike any of them either. Sora and Tazuki&#039;s friendship is a point of interest that is a driving force compared to anyone else, and at times really makes you wonder more. <br />
<br />
Definitely in the end, this anime is like a hidden gem for many who just want a relaxing series or some cheering up.
