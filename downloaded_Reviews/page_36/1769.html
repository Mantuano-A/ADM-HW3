    Tenshi Na Konamaiki is a show about a beautiful girl named Megumi Amatsuka. She&#039;s so gorgeous, in fact, that some people even call her an &amp;quot;angel&amp;quot; (hense: Tenshi). But behind the pretty face lies a shocking secret: Megumi used to be a boy!<br />
<br />
When Megumi was nine years old, (s)he came across a magic book with genie inside it. When Megumi, a rough and tumble elementary school boy, wished to be &amp;quot;the manliest man in the world&amp;quot; the tricky genie granted his wish backwards! Megumi transformed into a woman, and everyone around her seemed to forget she had ever been a boy at all. The only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7990">
        ones who remembered her past life as a male were herself and her best friend, Miki Hanakain.<br />
<br />
Now, six years later, Megumi is a gorgeous High school student whose still stuck on being a boy. She&#039;s loud, rude, violent, and too blunt for her own good. Miki tries her best to make Megumi into an upstanding lady, but her efforts are in vain: Megumi&#039;s determined to stay in touch with her manly side!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Megumi, her looks get her into more trouble than she can handle. First, the notorious school bully, Genzo Soga, falls head over heels in love with Megumi, transforming from a bad-boy into a blathering love-struck idiot. Then a group of well-meaning boys form &amp;quot;The Megu Group&amp;quot; in order to help protect Megumi from anything. And she&#039;ll need protecting! Megumi gets into more trouble than any teenage girl should! (Mostly because she picks fights with anyone who goes against her &amp;quot;manly&amp;quot; code of honor.)<br />
<br />
Tenshi Na Konamaiki is a shonen comedy anime with a romantic undertone. It&#039;s abundant with jokes, action, and sweet moments between characters. At first, I had a lot of trouble classifying this anime because it did so much at the same time. Shonen? Shojo? Comedy? But I soon realized that Tenshi was pulling off all three at the same time, and quite effectively.<br />
<br />
What really makes this series stand out is the cast of characters. All of them are insanely endearing -- from &amp;quot;average&amp;quot; Fujiki to the sweet best friend Miki. Genzo, an annoying weirdo who would get on anyone&#039;s nerves in real life, is fabulously fun to watch. I genuinely felt for Genzo as he tried to get Megumi to like him by being a &amp;quot;true man&amp;quot;. Each character has many levels of development, and Miki-chan, who starts out as the normal &amp;quot;best friend&amp;quot; character grows into one of the most dynamic characters on the show.<br />
<br />
The romance is done very well -- it isn&#039;t shoved in your face with a bunch of &amp;quot;omg!squee!&amp;quot; moments, but is instead built gradually, like a real relationship. I felt as though I really was watching these characters become closer and closer with each episode until they were inseparable. There&#039;s something about watching a group of best friends that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. And I always felt, before the romance, friendship was the first priority for the &amp;quot;Megu-Group&amp;quot;. Even the villains are done well - some are hilarious while others are downright sinister.<br />
<br />
The music for this show was really done well, especially the classic &amp;quot;heart-wrenching moment&amp;quot; track. God, that gets me every time. While the BG music is fabulous, the opening and ending themes vary in quality. There are a total of two opening themes and four ending themes. Of these, Grand Blue, the first opening theme, and Tears Go By the third ending theme, were my favorites. The others weren&#039;t bad songs, just uninteresting -- the kind you skip through.<br />
<br />
There was actually a fair amount of action in this show -- Genzo and Megumi were beating up bad guys at least once every other episode. And Megumi kicks major ass by the way. Her super-powered kicks send bad guys flying. But the rest of the Megu group hold themselves pretty well, including street legend Genzo and Samurai-in-Training Kobayashi. Even Miki has her moments of bad-guy-butt-kicking. The fight scenes are animated very well.<br />
<br />
Speaking of animation, the style of animation is actually very detailed and well-done. The style is a little accosting at first, but you get used to it rather quickly and even find it endearing after awhile. Megumi&#039;s long hair is also animated gorgeously, with plenty of highlights and motion effects. And the many moments of Chibi-Genzo are so adorably drawn. (I especially love the little board meetings that go on in Genzo&#039;s mind, where the many sides of his personality meet to discuss a current problem. Oh Genzo, you adorable dork.) I found that the animation actually got consistently better as the series went on. Might just be my imagination though.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is great. I can&#039;t really comment on Japanese voice actors in terms of acting skill, but the voices for the characters were all enthusiastic and fit their personalities fabulously. My favorite Seiyuu was definitely Genzo&#039;s -- he gave Genzo such a wide range and put 100% into every line. Megumi&#039;s seiyuu, Megumi Hayashibara, (ironic, no?), was also one of my favorites. She gave Megumi a tomboyish sounding voice that fit her perfectly.<br />
<br />
As for the plot, I&#039;m not going to deny that there are a few holes in the story. I&#039;ve heard the manga clears up some plot points a lot better than the anime does. For instance, the secret behind the magic that turned Megumi into a boy is a little fuzzy. And apparently, the ending in the anime is slightly different than that of the manga. I really should pick it up sometime. It&#039;s licensed by ViZ and all 20 volumes are out right now.<br />
<br />
Also, sometimes, I will admit that the plot slows down for a good ol&#039; fashioned pointless romp through fun-times. Now, while this is perfectly acceptable from time to time, I felt that in the beginning Tenshi had far too many &amp;quot;filler&amp;quot; episodes if you will. I really wanted to know more about Megumi&#039;s curse and I felt the series took a bit too much time to get there. But I&#039;d say, after episode 13, I got totally hooked. There are parts of this show where you will literally not be able to stop watching. Happened to me around three or four times, where I watched around four episodes in a row just because I needed to know what was going to happen next. This happened especially towards the end. Episodes 39-50 are must-see-right-nows (I watched these eleven episodes in the span of two days. No joke. It&#039;s been a long time since I stayed up until 1:30 AM watching anime.)<br />
<br />
The ending of the series was cute -- a little rushed -- but certainly cute. It was very open-ended, which is something I usually don&#039;t like in animes. But at the same time, I felt satisfied enough by the ending and felt that it just enough open for interpretation.<br />
<br />
What I really love about this show are the themes it addresses: what is it to be a man? What is it to be a woman? How do we decide who we are on the inside? What is &amp;quot;manly&amp;quot; -- standing up and fighting or letting go? I love the issues with gender that are brought up here as Megumi struggles with her identity. It&#039;s just so interesting to think about as you watch our heroine go through her trials.<br />
<br />
This show is currently unlicensed, but I can see why. It&#039;s very Japanese. It has a lot of Japanese puns and Japanese culture references, and just the way the characters act is very Japanese. It would be a challenge for any company to bring this over for an American release without butchering the content. A dub of this series would have to write around all the corny little Japanese puns -- no easy task. I don&#039;t really mind though. Although this series might be cute in English, the Japanese version is fine as is.<br />

    My honest opinion is very high on this anime. it is really well made but has a small problem, if you see it until the end you will have (almost sure) a question. &amp;quot;Should she/he be a girl or a boy&amp;quot;. Tough question if you ask me . But in general it is a good anime where you will have plenty of time to have a good laugh. In the firsts episodes you will understand the difficult life a boy transformed in a girl can have. To be honest this is my first review so don&#039;t be to hard on this. And hope you like

    Did you know it takes only three to five seconds for someone to form a first impression?<br />
<br />
Actually my first impression for tis anime is not that good. After watching first 5 episode here is my thought &quot;the art look so old fashion, the music sound so classical and i wonder if this anime is worth watching. Plan to drop it,<br />
<br />
 and then i give 2nd chance to myself and continue watching episode 5,6,7,8 and as a consequence i CANOT STOP watching until episode 50. The story start to develop/expand,  become more and more interesting after one another. Every episode is so ADDICTING !!You will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review209061">
        become absorb to the story line till the last episodes(tats why i rate 10 for story).<br />
<br />
In the end, im shouting to myself, dont judge book by its cover!!This is really a good anime with strong storyline and  i want more episodes :( i love tis anime.<br />
<br />
Not many people know about tis great anime and if they do, i believe this anime can become top 100 anime of all time. 1 of under-rated good anime.<br />
<br />
great show overall i enjoyed my time watching it! &lt;3

    Where do I even begin… This anime is just pure brilliance, if I would have to describe it in one word. The whole plot is amazing as well. Actually, it’s a funny story how I even stumbled upon this anime. There’s a screen cap of this anime that was circling around tumblr a while ago, and I just kind of got interested in the anime based on that. <br />
<br />
~Story~<br />
<br />
The story is about a 15-year-old girl Megumi, but she claims that she used to be boy and that a little demon who came out of a magic book turned her into a girl, though other people

          <span style="display: none;" id="review164887">
        have trouble believing it since Megumi is breathtakingly beautiful and feminine; hence the nickname Angel. So, according to Megumi she was 9-years-old when the event had taken place and her best friend Miki was also there with her. Megumi’s ‘’protection group’’ which consists of, Fujiki, Yasuda, Genzo and later on Kobayashi, want to help Megumi to find the magic book though they don’t really believe in her story. There’s a lot more to the anime than just finding the magic book, there’s also trouble with Miki, school trip disaster (if I do say so myself), and a lot of other different stuff! I can guarantee you that you will get totally hooked! There isn’t a single episode that is boring, there’s always something fun or something to look up to! There is also a bit of romance too but not the typical romance you would expect… And surely you will keep thinking this throughout the anime: ‘’Will Megumi be better as a boy or girl? Will she fall in love with anybody?’’ <br />
<br />
Warning! This anime has A LOT of violence, probably every episode or every other episode at least has violence in them. But that’s also the main thing that makes this anime so badass, Megumi’s awesome kicks, Genzo’s powerful punches and Kobayashi’s ninja skills are awesome to watch! Makes you want to be in the anime to help them all beat the bad guys up! The other main characters have their strengths too but mainly the fighting scenes are focused on Megumi, Genzo and Kobayashi. <br />
<br />
~Characters~<br />
<br />
I love the variation of characters in this anime, they’re all so different! And there is also quite a bit of characters too! Megumi is the main character who is called an angel because of her looks, but if you’d have a closer look she may even be more of a devil than an angel. Miki is Megumi’s best friend, always with her, always helping her etc., Genzo is the tough guy with cool hair and a evil face, the one who goes around picking fights but when he meets Megu, he turns totally soft and lovable. Yasuda is the total pervert who always carries around his camera to get good shots of Megumi, he’s also pretty handy when it comes to technology stuff. Fujiki is the average guy, nothing special about him, absolutely nothing, he’s just kind of there. Kobayashi actually hates Megu at the beginning but then he slowly starts to like her. He’s the badass ninja/samurai guy who is excellent at martial arts. There’s also a girl called Keiko who hates Megumi and wants to ruin her life because she is jealous of her, but things may actually turn the other way around… Then there’s the one EVERYONE will hate, Takao, the person who was chosen as Miki’s husband by Miki’s grandfather, when everything seems to be okay again this person will come mess things up again!<br />
<br />
~Animation~<br />
<br />
The art is not the best if you would compare it to the nowadays styles but I think that it actually makes this anime better, it gives it a different feeling, in my opinion. They actually make the fighting seems look really cool and effective.<br />
<br />
~Sound~<br />
<br />
Well of course the quality of the sound isn’t very good but again I think it gives a different feel to the anime than if the sound quality was excellent! The music was just the type that if you hear it a couple of times you will start singing it in your head for the rest of the day… But it wasn’t bad music!<br />
<br />
~Enjoyment~<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed it! It just has that something that keeps you on the edge all the time and there are so many different emotions that you will feel throughout the anime so you would definitely enjoy it! <br />

    Review of Tenshi na Konamaiki<br />
<br />
Genre: Magic, Romance, Comedy<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
[+] The plot is slightly unique, I rarely have seen gender bender animes which has a good premise and this anime is one of these.<br />
[+] This series will make you laugh out loud a lot of times and has a good number of episodes too.<br />
[+] The pacing is good, at least for me.<br />
[+] It has a respectable ending which wraps up almost everything.<br />
<br />
[-] Small plot hole. There&#039;s something wrong with the villains in the story, if they can use bombs why not use guns?<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
[+] Animation gradually gets better throughout the series.<br />
<br />
[-] Animation is mediocre at its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review172701">
        best. I was thinking of dropping this series after watching episode 1. The character designs especially the details of the face is just horrible, the eyes are uneven at times but yeah it was for only a couple of episodes<br />
[-] Even the angelic Megu doesn&#039;t look angelic because of bad animation(lol) <br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
[+] The OPs and EDs are quite catchy, if it wasn&#039;t for bad animation it could have been better.<br />
[+] Music is good but not outstanding.<br />
[+] Voice acting is quite good especially for the female protagonist megu<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
[+] All main characters are developed properly. Even the supporting characters are given 1-2 episodes each for character development.<br />
[+] Characters are likeable and fun to watch<br />
[+] Antagonists are doing their job as an antagonist.<br />
<br />
[-] Characters sometimes become generic.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
[+] The characters are very funny. It didn&#039;t bore me at least a single episode.<br />
[+] The story is quite interesting which led me to watch more<br />
[+] I finished this series within 3 days which doesn&#039;t happen too often<br />
<br />
[-] The animation hindered me for enjoying the anime.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
All in all I can say this story is good. It has action(fist fighting scenes), comedy, romance and more comedy that you can find in one anime. For me to recommend it to you, first:<br />
1. Do I like comedy with a lot of silly/funny characters?<br />
2. Do I still watch an anime even though it has mediocre animation?<br />
3. Do I like action scenes?<br />
4. Do I want to watch an anime with good antagonists?<br />
5. Do I like the mix of Romance and Comedy(RomCom)?<br />
<br />
If you answered yes on at least 3 questions, then I can recommend this anime for you.<br />
<br />
P.S<br />
Recommended Related Anime:<br />
If you have already watched this then you should also try School Rumble.<br />

    What can I say here. It is a true CLASSIC <br />
<br />
The anime hooked me since the first episode and it never failed to make me really happy to have started waching it! The plot seems a bit weird at the begining but when you enter the story it is a roller coaster of funny episodes laced with nice situations regarding all characters around Megumi, the boy turned into a girl that everybody loves.<br />
<br />
It all displaying a really nice art and animation, even though it is from the time it was done purelly by cells without the modern computer generated art. Gorgeous and well done it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21802">
        displays a masterpiece in animation as well as voice characterizations<br />
<br />
With 50 episodes, not a single one is boring or out of place, with no fillers and those boring episodes just to stall a series until it runs its predetermined number of episodes.<br />
<br />
Pitty is that the end could be longer....aha, I really wnated to see him/her finally mellowing to Genzo, though it is clear that it will happen in the anime story line (he/she kissed him and was clearly falling for the guy)<br />
<br />
I am currently acquiring the 20 volumes manga....and in more 3 or 4 days I expect to have it all ready to read...I am really eager to see how the story developed there in the end, as I heard the manga has a different end (well, I may dislike it as I almost thought Megumi would turn back into a guy after kissing Genzo...brrr....I hope that is not the case, as they make a nice couple plus the guy loved her deeply ). Soon I will know it. I loved the anime end as all characters ended in a happy way!<br />
<br />
Of course Megumi Hayashibara (playing Megumi Amatsuka) added a ton to the character! I simply love her and the way she plays her characters!<br />
<br />
I saw all 50 eps in 4 days! My Otaku Side was running rampant with this jewell of a series!<br />
<br />
I sure classic, and a true Anime Masterpiece! <br />

    Tenshi na Konamaiki, or Cheeky Angel, may be an older series lacking in animation, but it is a lot more enjoyable than many contemporary series. Warning: this review is long.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
I admit, the story was disappointing. I was expecting it to be darker and more complex than it turned out to be. I wanted to know so much more about the magic book, but the anime seemed to give up on that halfway through and we don&#039;t really see the genie again. There are countless plot holes littered throughout, and the magical aspect of Megumi&#039;s situation is left unexplained. The ending is ambiguous, which may

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241983">
        be the best way to close this anime, as we can interpret for ourselves the heroine&#039;s past and her real gender. I do wish we had gotten closure on what exactly the genie did to Megumi&#039;s memory, though. <br />
<br />
Like most other anime series, it cannot be judged on whether it&#039;s realistic or not. There are too many deus ex machina moments to name, and the characters have Hulk-level strength, literally destroying a boulder with a touch. In terms of pacing, there was too much filler. Way too much. As a result, the plot-heavy episodes flew by and the filler ones dragged on for light years. This series could have been done in half the length. The only thing that kept me from skipping scenes was the comedy. On the other hand, the ending was so rushed I felt like I aged a year in twenty minutes.   <br />
<br />
This anime also has romance, but it&#039;s more of an afterthought and the main character isn&#039;t very interested in falling in love, so the show never falls into the trap of sacrificing other developments for the romantic relationship. Also with the whole what-gender-is-she question, even Megumi isn&#039;t quite sure what she likes. Does she like guys? Or girls? There are plenty of flags indicating possible pairings, but they rarely lead to anything. Megumi seems to have some memory loss between episodes, much to the distress of her admirers. <br />
<br />
Art: 5<br />
This is perhaps Tenshi na Konamaiki&#039;s weakest point. The art is not fluid and gets so noticeably bad at times that you&#039;re distracted from the story. The action scenes aren&#039;t well done and all the fights look the same. That being said, I soon got used to the style and it didn&#039;t bother me anymore after 10 episodes. In fact, it has a charm of its own. In the beginning, I found it laughable that everyone admired Megumi&#039;s looks so much when the art did not reflect that. By the end, though, I thought she was beautiful, in the most breathtaking way.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
The sound effects are all right. The background music is fittingly used--I have to say it&#039;s more pleasant than most shows I&#039;ve seen. I wouldn&#039;t mind listening to it on its own. The OP and ED and pretty catchy and I rarely skipped them.<br />
<br />
I have to give a shout-out to the seiyuu of Tenshi na Konamaiki; they&#039;ve all done an outstanding job. Genzo&#039;s seiyuu, in particular, was masterful and made me love the character. I don&#039;t know how that man can go from serious, manly hero to goofy, lovestruck puppy who just wants to make Megu happy. And of course, Megumi Hayashibara, who shares a name with her character, was flawless as a tomboy. This was an unusual role for her, I can see why she picked it.<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
The concept of a boy magically becoming a girl is an intriguing concept, and one that is sure to lead to inner conflict on the meaning of gender to oneself and to society as well as questions regarding one&#039;s identity. The main character does a fair amount of questioning--it just seems to lead to nowhere. She has practically the same understanding of her identity at the end as she does in the beginning. However, this doesn&#039;t mean Megumi isn&#039;t a wonderful character, because she is. She is attractive and intelligent and compassionate, with a rebellious streak and innocent nature. She&#039;s the woman of all women, but she wants to be a man, and goes out of her way to act like one, or at least how she thinks they should act. This aspect makes her automatically more interesting than most heroines. She tries to be strong, yet she cannot be as strong as she would like because she&#039;s a woman. The frustration is definitely there. In the times she&#039;s helped out by men, we cannot be sure if the blush on her face is due to jealousy, admiration, or something deeper...<br />
<br />
The supporting characters are all likable and each get their own focus. No one is left out, and all the better for us viewers. They do play into tropes, but get rounded out so that they have distinctive personalities, hopes, fears, etc. Of all of them, Genzo made the biggest impression on me. Starting out an arrogant bully, he develops into the most admirable man. Megumi brings out the best in him, as she does all the supporting characters. You can sense the caring they have not only for her, but for each other. There is a lot of bickering, naturally, but also strong friendship hidden underneath. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have the same praise for the villains. I&#039;m not sure the writers tried to make them anything but unsympathetic. They have no depth, no imagination. Even the way they carry out their acts is boring (and illogical, since they constantly lose to 15-year-olds). Their motivation for committing crimes is flimsy and never justifiable. In this anime, we are never to side with them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
It&#039;s very enjoyable, and will make you laugh out loud. I actually laughed so hard my stomach hurt! For its humor alone, this series is memorable. I just had a good time watching it when I had nothing else to do. Its being such a lighthearted anime took my mind off my own stress. I&#039;m not going to watch the entire series again as it&#039;s too long, but I may check out a few episodes, particularly the ones that involve Miki, as those had a lot of emotional development, and I liked seeing Megu act like a prince! They belong together, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
This series has its faults, for sure. They become especially obvious when you think too deeply about the whys and hows of it. In any event, I took a chance on watching this and, while it may have been too long, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Though there is no profound gender commentary like you would hope for in a story such as this one, if you&#039;re longing for some good old fashioned comedy or just looking for a fun way to kill time, I encourage you to try this anime out!

    This anime was quite enjoyable. The story line was interesting, and well developed. The characters were endearing, strong and cool. It was nice that Megumi&#039;s friends covered the whole gammit of stereotypes in Japanese culture.. <br />
The animation was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. I liked the OP &amp; ED songs- they were catchy. What really shined in this series was the characters, as I mentioned they fit stereotypes, but even still they all evolved and developed into more noble characters as the series progressed. Overall, a very good series that I&#039;d recommend to anyone who likes romance, comedy and action.

    I hope this summary is more interesting and persuading to influence you to watch:<br />
<br />

          <span style="display: none;" id="review132119">
        <br />
<br />
Storyline: Was perfect, I loved it. It was original and different. Not much anime involves gender reverse. <br />
<br />
Art: The art is old style/classic. Its made back in the 2000&#039;s, what else do you expect? But! Like they always say, Never JUDGE a cover of a book! I was less interested when I saw the drawings, but after giving it a shot, my god! The drawings didn&#039;t even matter to me anymore! It was so good enough to let the art not bother me! I mean like, the drawings are decent and good, (especially Soga, he&#039;s so hot..) but Megumi (the main character) could do better. Either way, I liked it a lot. Good art, not high quality, but good classic.<br />
<br />
Sound: I loved the music, the music fit every scene. I THINK the music most likely was also used in the anime GTO. The songs are very familiar. The voices are also perfect. All the voices fit the characters perfectly, the voice actors did a perfect job.<br />
<br />
Characters; I liked the character&#039;s personality. Was great, interesting characteristics for most of the characters!! Very funny<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I had the best time of my life. Every time I watch a new episode, I tear up because I don&#039;t want it to end so fast. I got so addicted to the anime, I finished it within 3 days despite the fact it has 50 episodes. I stayed up all night because it was too addicting. Watching this anime, the time passed by way to quickly. But yeah, It was really fun, warm, happy anime. <br />
<br />
Overall: I love the anime. Its rare to find such a really good shoujo anime like this. This anime, its really hard to find any anime thats similar. No anime can replace this anime.

    Tenshi na Konamaiki is certainly a one of a kind. This anime has an amazing storyline. Some of us may question what happens if a male suddenly becomes a female. This anime highlights both strengths and weaknesses of being a man or woman, whilst telling a good story of Megumi and how she gets on with daily life.<br />
Watching this anime has been very enjoyable, with the comedy that makes you laugh ever so often and the sweet storyline that keeps you watching it.<br />
The artwork cannot be seen as new, however the artwork does not influence the good story of an anime. I personally think that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review115529">
        the artwork of this anime is great.<br />
My only criticism is that to get a better understanding of the events in Tenshi na Konamaiki, you may need to read the last few chapters of the manga for answers. <br />
Other than this I think the anime was outstanding.

    my only romance anime as i remember, i dont actually watch this kind of anime but since this is one of my childhood anime that was aired( watched some episode) and on my college days i decided to finished it and im glad i did.<br />
<br />
all i can say about this anime is very funny and romance is great you will never regret watching this esp. if you love romance (from a non romance fans of anime hehe). ost is also great one of my favorite song and always on my playlist. well some of reviewers here dont like the art style but i think that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321336">
        art style bring life to comedy. story is great other than romance anime (weird but not in a badway because people dont like the idea of how the main character true _____  .).

    Ah, Cheeky Angel.  This is one of my favorite anime, but I must admit a little bit of a love-hate relationship with it.  Perhaps the most extensive gender-bender anime of them all, it truly delves deeply into exploring what it means to be a woman or a man.  Even factoring out my personal fascination with the subject matter, Cheeky Angel stands on its own merits with good humor, surprisingly well-developed romance, and daily situations that should please any slice-of-life fan.  And yet, it is also has easily the worst artwork and character designs I have ever seen.  If you can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297995">
        use your imagination and get past the terrible visual quality, underneath lies an adventure worth spending 50 episodes on.<br />
<br />
Despite being so beautiful strangers will stop in the street and stare at her, the main character Megumi identifies with being a boy.  It is revealed very early on that she used to be a boy at some point in the past.  She is admired by boys of all sorts at her school but especially by the tough-guy Genzo.  Right off the bat we have our first accurate characterization of socialization by gender: Megumi establishes herself as a rival for martial ability with Genzo.  Indeed, men determine the alpha by sizing each other up from a martial perspective: &quot;Can I take him in a fight?&quot;  Women, on the other hand, seem to establish a pecking order based on beauty, social status, and charisma (personality).  Megumi, despite her appearance, still identifies with being a boy and so is constantly getting into fights and doing unladylike things.<br />
<br />
Megumi&#039;s childhood friend and fellow classmate, Miki, attempts to curb Megumi&#039;s worst tomboy impulses.  She is Megumi&#039;s constant companion, and is determined to teach her bff how to act more like a girl.  Other side characters join in the fun, forming the Megu Group to protect her from harm.  I found the daily antics of everyone to be both endearing and representative of the quality you find in older anime.  The dialogue is more coarse and less concerned with being witty.  The jokes are straightforward and hit-or-miss.  Situations at school are outrageous and exaggerated.  Megumi&#039;s day-to-day life is presented with lots of recurring plot lines, forming the kind of episodic format you often find in &quot;monster of the week&quot; shows.  And yet, refreshingly, characters do change and relationships actually progress through the series.<br />
<br />
And so, Cheeky Angel establishes its main hook and recurring theme: Does Megumi relate more to being a woman or a man?  Despite initially being a brash and loud tomboy, Megumi is eventually conflicted regarding her sense of self.  At the outset, her mindset is somewhat trapped at the stage of identifying with a young boy&#039;s priorities, like being &quot;manly.&quot;  And yet, as she becomes increasingly aware of gender-specific situations (like male attention), she increasingly catches herself thinking like a girl.  <br />
<br />
This anime explores these ideas to a depth and detail like no other.  Granted, with 50 episodes to work with, it can take its time revealing Megumi&#039;s journey of self-discovery.  Other anime might have brief &quot;specials&quot; which involve a gender swap, or use the gender-bending as a gimmick for something like fan service or comedy.  Cheeky Angel is actually interested in a genuine dialogue about the topic. <br />
<br />
Boys and girls might gossip about the other gender, but BEING or BECOMING the other gender doesn&#039;t seem to be a widely accepted topic in polite conversation, receiving stigma that is only slightly milder than the topic of homosexuality.  Some people want to be the other gender because their romantic gender-object is currently the same gender as they are.  Some people just prefer the other gender&#039;s clothes.  Some people are curious about what it would be like to interact socially with others as the opposite gender.  Cheeky Angel goes as far as to give each of these viewers something during the course of its story line.  For example, despite kicking all manner of people during the show, Megumi finds time to appreciate dressing like a woman.  She doesn&#039;t seek boys&#039; attention like other girls she meets, but at times she finds herself admiring specific people who have traits she wishes to develop herself, like courage, skill, and a strong sense of justice.  Does she like boys or girls?  Cheeky Angel seems to be saying that maybe love is more complicated than the physical plumbing we are assigned at birth.<br />
<br />
The show encourages us to ask ourselves, how much of established behavior for men and women is dictated by society, and how much is innate?  I have a one year old daughter and she hates all sorts of things.  She hates vegetables, Legos, Linkin Logs, and Mr. Potatohead, but she loves shoes.  She has a pretty pink pair of shoes, and she often goes out of her way to hand them to me with a grunt, indicating I should help her put them on. She&#039;s too little to know what society thinks girls should like.  So is there something to the stereotype that girls like shoes?  (My wife assures me that little boys like shoes, too.)  Yeah, Cheeky Angel goes to those kinds of places.<br />
<br />
I love exploring this subject matter, and I found Cheeky Angel scratched that itch more thoroughly than any of its fellow anime.  And yet, I would be remiss if I didn&#039;t at least mention the sore topic of the artwork.  There&#039;s no getting around it: Cheeky Angel looks like someone you beer-goggled and despite being dead drunk and not having had an encounter in the last decade you actually thought, &quot;nah, I&#039;ll pass.&quot;  It is a level of awful that far exceeds what one might expect just from it being an older show.  For example, Ranma 1/2 is much older but despite this the art is endearing and much more consistent.  Cheeky Angel is almost belligerent in its amateurish animation and ugly character designs.  But the worst are the faces.  Proportions are off, and eyes and mouth don&#039;t match from one frame to the next.  A kid with crayons can do better drawing stick figures in a flip book.  Megumi is supposed to be beautiful, angelic.  Why, then, does she look like throw-up after a muddy dog has rolled around in it?  I&#039;m sorry to be so picky, but most of the fun in the show comes from the &quot;what-if&quot; of being a beautiful girl, and instead we are constantly presented with the &quot;what-if&quot; of being in the late-stages of zombie undeadhood--after April has taken a bat to our face.  Cheeky Angel is so bad it had me thinking back fondly of the moe-blob girl faces from Clannad (previous &quot;worst anime face art&quot; title holder, now easily dethroned.)<br />
<br />
I&#039;m sorry this was so long, but I really wanted to give you a good idea of what Cheeky Angel had to offer.  Maybe there just isn&#039;t any other show sufficiently like it.  If you are parched in the desert and stumble on a water fountain, maybe you don&#039;t wait around hoping the uncomfortably warm water turns cooler after a while.  You slurp it down because there simply isn&#039;t another fountain in sight for miles.  If it&#039;s the only anime brave enough to really satiate our gender-role curiosity thirst, so what if some suspicious green furry stuff is growing on it.

First things first. My &quot;reviews&quot; system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.<br />
------<br />
<br />
✦Story<br />
Wanted to rant regarding gender bender, but because of how story goes. It becomes irrelevant so I will mention only 1 thing regarding gender bender. There are 2 types of them. In one of them gender is bent truly, which means character/person mind, soul, body, mentality becomes fully woman. Other is kind of a temporal acquisition of body for exploration I guess. Anyhow moving to actual story section of &quot;Tenshi na Konamaiki&quot;<br />
<br />
I found the story of this anime was quite enjoyable. It had fair amount of progression

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290906">
        and actually some development relationships. Another bonus is that this anime had fair amount of interesting plot points and backgrounds of various characters. It&#039;s fairly cheerful, fun and joyful story, whilst at the same time it has some drama and darkness to it.<br />
<br />
On a bad side, I felt characters stayed &quot;same&quot; and lacked growth. As well &quot;thugs&quot; incompetence is just annoying tedious. It&#039;s gag Anime, but felt as it should been a bit more serious.<br />
<br />
Aside that there were some story points and moments that felt utterly unnecessary and at the same time some moments felt as they were skimmed through. Storytelling does present a lot of corniness, most are for humorous purposes whilst some are ironically serious.<br />
<br />
Would like to add few comments regarding pierro there, but I can&#039;t think of nor bothered to comment about it without spoilers.<br />
<br />
To wrap up my thoughts regarding story of this Anime. It&#039;s quite good, classic, funny and very sweet. But it suffers from a bit tedious inconsistency and weak finale.<br />
<br />
✦Art<br />
Again, it&#039;s old anime so I cannot really compare from my memory to other Anime that aired around the years of this one. But, I did feel the Art &amp; Animation was pretty good. It had an immense amount of priceless facial expressions and a lot of very heart melting cute moments. Characters and world looked mostly fitting and good enough.<br />
<br />
Although at times it felt really cheap.<br />
<br />
✦Sound<br />
I did enjoy 2nd opening a lot. Rest of music and OST was actually between &quot;okay&quot; and &quot;good&quot;. Here I want mention though that certain soundtrack really reminded me in a odd way &quot;X-Files&quot; main theme. But as whole I consider that music of this Anime superb.<br />
<br />
✦Character<br />
As somewhat mentioned on story section. Characters lack a bit of a &quot;growth&quot; as they really remained almost exactly same the whole show.<br />
<br />
Aside that, most of the characters very stereotypically fun. Various personalities and quite classic.<br />
I won&#039;t go in-depth with main cast, but I will mention main girl &quot;Megumi&quot;. As synopsis mentions she is a girl with a past of being a boy. So her personality is obviously &quot;tomboy&quot;. Now, to be clear, I don&#039;t like tomboys, not fan of them. But Megumi was done in a really adorable way. So I couldn&#039;t dislike her. Looks wise she is beauty whilst inside she is rough, crude tomboy. But seeing her cute girly meltdowns were absolutely cute. But, truth is different as you watch this Anime. But that is for viewer to discover.<br />
<br />
And to round it all up. Main girl is the best part of this Anime. While indeed there  a lot of other nice characters and side-characters of a various stereotypes, Megumi is a very good main lead/spotlight.<br />
<br />
✦Enjoyment &amp; Overall<br />
I did mention most of the stuff already around the story and character sections, but I can add that aside it&#039;s few lacking points and stupidity, it was  a really enjoyable show and actually pretty good. Did not expect it to be this enjoyable and well made.<br />
<br />
If the gag aspect would been toned down a bit and we would seen a bit more of formed or potentially formed couple moments and with a bit better finale. I would actually given this Anime a &quot;9&quot; . But indeed it had quite few points that simply couldn&#039;t let me give it a higher score.<br />
<br />
To wrap it all up. If you like tomboys and like romance with cheesy, corny moments plus gag comedy and some classic stereotypes. Then it will be a quite fun ride.

    i hate this show so much. so much. i put it aside after 15 episodes because of how bad it was. i only kept watching because i really liked megumi as a character. i&#039;m glad i did! because i also love this show a lot lol.<br />
<br />
i honestly don&#039;t even remember much about the first 15 episodes due to how long it has been since i&#039;ve watched them. maybe they weren&#039;t so bad, but they probably weren&#039;t that good either lmao. i just remember being really disgusted. i think it was pointless. i didn&#039;t really care one way or another. and it was disgusting. i don&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265339">
        know.<br />
<br />
i think i got serious about finishing once keiko was introduced. i love horror. i really do. so i guess that&#039;s why. i was positively surprised that they kept bringing that atmosphere back... i never expected to get something enjoyable out of watching this. yamato nadeshiko cup arc was especially amazing! i loved it so much.<br />
<br />
the soundtrack was amazing too. like i would definitely download it. and i love that silly music they use in battle sequences or whatever. the voice acting was superb. i think it&#039;s so weird that all this great stuff was embedded into this show? i&#039;m so surprised. i didn&#039;t expect that. i said that already.<br />
<br />
also, the characters were likable. and i was happy to see them progress. especially miki. i didn&#039;t really care for the romance or whatever that was supposed to be. i really really loved every single villain. you know you never really expect much out of them, it never gets that serious. this time it did! it was worth watching just to see some evil villains.<br />
<br />
i think i hated the art style when i first started watching this but it really grew on me lol. i mean, i think it&#039;s kind of ugly but appealing as well.<br />
<br />
and! i honestly think it was funny. i laughed out loud a few times. sometimes it disgusted me but it&#039;s just the stuff you see everywhere else so. so. i can overlook it. i don&#039;t get it though.<br />
<br />
it&#039;s really weird. it was an experience in itself. broadened my horizons and whatnot. i&#039;m like torn between giving this a 9 or 1 so just gonna settle for a 6 and think about it all day long for a while

    I avoided this anime for quite some time because it has that 1990&#039;s early 2000&#039;s art style which I hate. I decided to finally give it a try though when I was in an anime slump. Overall I was extremely shocked! The story line is about a guy who gets magically changed into a really hot girl and then has the problems that every girl faces in high school. The biggest issue appears to be the fact that she causes a lot of boys to faun all over her which then makes the high school dating aspect a mess. I found myself laughing from the

    good show, great openings, Megumi is BAE, adaption missed the mark, especially at the end.<br />
<br />
decent OST, though some tracks have a doom/gloom feel, one in particular sounds like bad campy tv drama lol. Both openings are super solid, make sure to check them out on youtube to get people turned on to this story please, thank you!<br />
<br />
not the most trope free or complex characters, but the cast is charming. Megumi in particular is amazing.<br />
<br />
plot is engaging enough, if you&#039;re curious to know what Megumi&#039;s fate ends up as.<br />
<br />

        MANGA FIRST]. the ending arc has real danger and legitimate suspense, and the conclusion is great. the anime loses serious points from me because they dull down the danger in the final arc and it has a directly opposite conclusion to its source material. <br />
<br />
having read the manga after watching the first episode i can say it was the best move. they made some questionable edits that actually ruined the conclusion so do the same as I did. <br />

    This anime is very well made and thoroughly enjoyable. It is unadulterated by fan services and cliches of this age anime, even a kiss is cleverly concealed. I guess for that age it was proper. Its not totally free from cliches but it doesn&#039;t heavily reply on them. It still remains enjoyable solely on story and characters and plots. the anime doesn&#039;t ask much from the viewers, it doesn&#039;t ask for us to keep our brains at a corner to enjoy it. Somehow without compromising on this the story hooks you on despite being a comedy.<br />
<br />
The story revolves around a group of guys who have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review70607">
        come together to on common pretext that they appreciate and are totally in love with a girl however there is a catch, the girl was actually a boy and was made into a girl because of an evil gene. This pretext is simple but almost every possible angle for an interesting story and plot emerging from it has been explored. And this is where the creativity of the author shines brightly and none of the 50 episodes bore you. I commend the genius in the author to create such a story where consistency of characters and fluency and continuation in story has been maintained so well. Its a perfect rom-com where comedy is as good as a pure comedy and has very interesting plots. Highly recommend to fans of comedy and rom-coms and people looking for good story and characters.<br />
