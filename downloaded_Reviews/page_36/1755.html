    Considerably better than the TV anime.<br />
<br />
I attended one of the theatrical releases and I&#039;d have to say as a fan of the novels, I came away very satisfied.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m gonna keep this short and spoiler free. The movie flowed quite nicely with no overly long info dumps that messed up the pacing in the TV anime. The action is fun and exciting, not just Tatsuya, multiple characters get to kick some ass. The movie was also very comical, quite a few scenes had the audience in my viewing cracking up. The story was pretty straight forward and not to convoluted, which allowed it to be more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254203">
        engaging and straight to the point. Also for the fan service lovers, there&#039;s a few scenes in the movie that you&#039;ll be happy to see.<br />
<br />
The only cons I have are the fact that if you&#039;ve haven&#039;t read volumes 8-11 of the LN, you&#039;ll be a bit lost and confused about some things that transpire or happened in between the movie and the TV series(The movie takes place after volume 11), the movie&#039;s production value could have been a bit higher(it looked more like a glorified OVA than an actually theatrical film), and it could have done with a longer run-time(like 15-30 minutes longer would have been nice).<br />
<br />
Overall, the movie should be a very enjoyable experience to fans who keep up with the source material and even anime only fans should have fun watching the characters go on another adventure/mission. Even if you didn&#039;t like the TV anime series, you might like this more if your main problem with the TV anime was its pacing and minimal action. Just don&#039;t expect this to be a real continuation of the anime series as this is just mostly a standalone action flick(though it technically is considered canon).<br />
<br />
PSA: To get the full amount of the enjoyment of the film, you should either:<br />
a)Read volume 8-11<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
b)Read the summaries on the Mahouka wiki to at least get a grasp of those volumes and what transpires in them.<br />
<br />
The reason I say this is that there are characters(Lina in particularly) and events that are referenced(via flashback or other means) that are in the film, but do not appear in the anime and only appear in the LN volumes that I&#039;ve mentioned. They author stated that this movie is primarily targeted for the fans that keep up with the novels, so the best way to enjoy this movie is to have a good idea about what transpired between the anime series and the movie.<br />

    The irregular at magic high school movie, while visually interesting, suffers from poor pacing and a plot hole ridden storyline that represents a microcosm of the series as a whole. The movie itself plays like an extended bonus episode rather than a continuation or culmination of the show it is based on. <br />
<br />
The movie suffers from pacing whiplash, going from mysterious high-stakes action to slice-of-life cute girls doing cute things with a gratuitous amount of fanservice (the majority of the movie), back to serious, fast-paced action. The new characters introduced barely get any characterization due to the bloated cast and the plot is problematic. Many

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255225">
        things happen in the story that should have wider implications than what the movie allows. Like branches of the military attacking each other, an act of war from an outside nation, magician slavery, and tension between military and civilians. all of which are dismissed at the end of the movie. As for the main characters, there is no growth or significant development in their story, or in any other recurring characters&#039; stories. The action portion of the movie, although spectacular, cannot save the movie from its weak storyline and character development.  <br />
<br />
Overall, I left the movie a little dissappointed. Maybe the light novels do a better job at pacing and the overall plot, but the movie is little more than spectacle and fanservice.

    Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei is one of the more popular Light Novel series to have come out within the past decade or so, spawning an anime adaptation by Studio Madhouse in 2014. <br />
<br />
That anime was also a gigantic piece of shit.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, this movie isn&#039;t so bad.<br />
<br />
That isn&#039;t to say this was a good or even passable film, however. It still suffers from flat characterization, holes and leaps in logic, pacing issues, and a major switch from one major object being a threat to another, with the first object being ignored entirely after the halfway mark, among other problems. It feels like a short filler arc

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270245">
        of the show, though thankfully issues carried from the show are largely subdued.<br />
<br />
Visually, the movie is passable. For one, they fixed the lighting issue to a decent extent, now I don&#039;t have to squint to avoid my eyes being set on fire from the needlessly bright lighting effects. The artstyle is as bad as ever though, and the CGI is both horrible and prevalent. The fights and overall magic were pretty bad as well. At the very least, we got to see characters in a variety of fashionable uniforms outside of their school attire, which was thankfully absent throughout the film. Studio 8bit, while doing a mediocre job by anime film standards, still has a far more visually appealing product that the original, which is the long and short of it all.<br />
<br />
Taku Iwasaki returns as the composer of the music for the film and it was far superior to his work on the show. There were two moments where the music did not fit the scenes, including a happy piano track halfway and an awful dubstep song during the big magic fight sequence near the start of the third act. The rest of the tracks sounded perfectly fine, with one vocal track near the beginning being probably the best in the movie, if not for GARNiDELiA doing another stellar performance with the ED song “SPEED STAR”. This is already a far cry from the amount of terrible tracks and times where the music does not fit the scenes in the original TV series. These audiovisual improvements did fix major gripes I had with the original to the point where it almost felt unfair as part of any enjoyment this film provided was fixing mistakes that should&#039;ve never happened to begin with.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that&#039;s where any relative positives end, as the film is still a mess. There is this important character named Angelina, who has important relations with much of the relevant cast from the show. However, she wasn&#039;t in the TV anime and the film doesn&#039;t even establish their connection and instead assumes we already know, despite the fact that a large fraction of the audience of this film are only familiar with the anime, potentially leaving the viewer incredibly lost. Two groups of characters effectively on the same side fight to the death because they&#039;re too stupid to explain what is going on, and one of them named Siegfried has some sort of bad blood with Leonheart, that again, is not established in this film, leading to the exact same problems as with Angelina. There is a character who only exist to be an obnoxious sadistic psychopath knife-wielder for the sake of such a character trait, and he disposed of by an enemy who should be an ally hit because both sides are stupid they don’t communicate that they have the exact same goal and should be working in tandem to stop the big threat of this movie. As for the characters we’re already familiar with, they are still immensely flat and dry, and some characters don&#039;t really have a reason to be in the film due to sheer irrelevance, such as Mikihiko. This isn&#039;t entirely the film’s fault, as the 2014 anime showcased them as worthless garbage anyway, and oddly enough, the women largely feel the same in this film, not even feeling like individual character tropes like in the show proper. Thankfully, the worst aspects of the main sibling pair are subdued due to the limited runtime, however, they are still as generic and dull as ever, if not nearly as infuriating.<br />
<br />
There is this asteroid that is threatened to be in a collision course with the Earth, and this is established as the main threat due to scientists. However, that gets dropped halfway through the film with no resolution and instead it gets replaced by this satellite the researches were trying to move for some unexplained reason. Unfortunately, given that not many people have seen this film and this review is written without spoilers, I cannot go into further detail, nor can I explain any of the other problems with this film that require spoilers. However, there are a few that can be listed here, such as the sheer lack of subplots, the fact that it took Mayumi so long to realize that her plane was taken by her friends and that there was an important passenger with them (it took a day), the lack of consistency regarding magic being used with or without codes (since it has been established you need to use magic codes to use any form of magic), and that the scientists have no motivations for their actions beyond a one-off line of dialogue about the Navy accepting them. We aren&#039;t even made aware of their plans. Lastly, it turns it that some of the character graduated, but Tatsuya is the same age and no one has reportedly aged. This could also explain why Erika is somewhat of a different character than before, but then we’d have missed important character development; not like the series could even attempt such a thing.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, while this film was a considerable improvement from the 2014 Madhouse anime, it is still a lackluster film without much of an engaging narrative and a sheer lack of decent characterization, as well as an inheritance of some of the series’ major problems, even if it does attempt to at least subdue issues involving the production, the main duo, and the lack of cohesion with the music and the scenes back then. The third arc is where most of these issues come to a head, turning a movie that would have otherwise been classified as “so ok it&#039;s average” into a bewildering mess that just happens to be an improvement. Even fans of the anime could get confused as to what’s going on regarding certain characters, which is a large issue. You could say this review is damning with faint praise, but that’s the best thing this lackluster film deserves. Regardless, with all that said, I bid you adieu.

    First review so yeah..<br />
Went to the US premier. Just like the anime, visuals and sound were on point, I think the fight scenes were well drawn and quite flashy. Basically every scene had its own sound track that matched it very well. I felt like the movie was a little rushed and the story was kind of loosely put together. There were things that didn&#039;t make sense in terms of relevance to the plot. I feel that the way that the movie was put together, there wasn&#039;t a balance in terms of fighting and plot development. Just like the anime, there was a lot of

        explanation before any action could take place. Overall, it was alright.

    [I watched Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Movie: Hoshi wo Yobu Shoujo at CGV Cinemas Grand Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia on September 16th, 2017]<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10 (Good)<br />
the movie feels like a side story. In general the movie just a little too fast, like not understanding what happened.<br />
<br />
/Story/:  Tatsuya and Miyuki have finished their first year at First Magic High School and are on their spring break. The two go to their villa on the Ogasawara Island archipelago. After only a small moment of peace a lone young woman named Kokoa appears before them. She has abandoned the Naval base and she tells Tatsuya her one wish.<br />
<br />
When I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258138">
        watched this. I feel like don&#039;t understand what happen. New characters were introduced but never really explained how they knew each other. <br />
For me this movie more like OVA but in Action version.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10 (Good)<br />
The CGI for random NPC (I don&#039;t know what that name) is really bad, But for the backgrounds and Characters is really good<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10 (Very Good)<br />
I really Love this movie soundtrack feels very fit with this movie.<br />
<br />
Personally to me some of the dialogues at the beginning were pretty pointless and doesn’t build up the story in any particular way. <br />
And Nice Ending Song by GARNiDELiA ^o^<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10 (Fair)<br />
I don&#039;t really understand what happen, most of the characters just shows then go. ok thanks for fanservice by the way. New characters were introduced but never really explained how they knew each other. the actions scenes and conflict occurring as their motives wasn’t strong enough. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10 (Fair)<br />
This movie is really fast and New characters were introduced but never really explained how they knew each other. I feel really don&#039;t understand when I watch this. You can probably still enjoy this movie without watching the anime series<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10 (Good)<br />
Overall NICE FANSERVICE BY THE WAY!!!<br />
Also there is one ending credit scene so remember to stay back.

    To be a short and convenient review for everyone, I’m gonna say this anime is a fan-oriented anime. The audiences can obtain what they want to see in this movie, such as the impressive magic and action scenes. Although the story is common, the audiences can also enjoy in it. <br />
<br />
I believe what you want in this series is to watch the main character to perform lots of cool actions and enjoy the process showing how the main characters defeat the bad guys. For the material mentioned above, they are available in this anime. Besides Tatsuya and Miyuki, the anime gives chances to others characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270009">
        to perform their magic equally. <br />
<br />
As for the Art and Music, this anime gives common quality as other movie version does. It achieves fair scores on them. In the other words, these two factors provide the reason why I give this anime a overall grade, 7. They are not impressed on a positive side nor a negative one. <br />
<br />
Plot is the drawback of this anime. To be honest, the plot sucks compared to other original movies. However, as I said previously, this is a fan-oriented movie. The audiences are looking for cool things. They just want to see how Tatsuya beat enemies and nothing else. At this point, this plot of this anime does it duty. 5 is the highest point that I could give. <br />
<br />
In the end, for the fans of this series, I recommend this anime to you. I believe you would find something you want.

    ***There are spoilers hinted at in this review***<br />
<br />
To preface this review know this, I love the TV series. It gets crapped on for reasons that usually deserve distaste (OP, know-it-all MC that happens to have a sister and a plethora of other females all lining up to take him). However, the TV series crafted a lot of really enjoyable experiences with its tight-knit cast and interesting plot scenarios. <br />
<br />
With that out of the way, lets talk about this film.<br />
<br />
This film is, in my honest opinion, a complete waste of time to watch unless you are the up-most die-hard of a fan. The film accomplishes a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271149">
        super long, drawn-out objective after meandering on for tens of minutes with the most dull conversation scenes. <br />
<br />
But first, lets talk aesthetics. I always liked the visual style of the TV series. I&#039;ve seen people comment on how it looks “too clean and crisp”. This is a valid criticism; if you make something that hits both of these marks, it can look foreign and void of personality. I however do not hold this train of thought for Magic Highschool. For me, the series has a very distinctive look and feel to its world. It has a clear vision of how advanced the world is compared to our own, the color pallet is for the most part a set of cool colors, and pretty much every character looks unique. <br />
<br />
The film holds these values in-check which is a good thing. You can come off of the TV series and watch this film and it will fall almost perfectly in place visual wise. What will not mesh well however is the pretty abhorrent CG used in the film. CG characters and CG objects really clash with the other visuals on-screen especially when it is a moving object. Tanks in motion look fucking awful in almost every incident. Thankfully, the rest of the visual elements pick up the slack and make this film look good. It lacks that extra movie flair but is a step up from the TV series (which was already a pretty high bar in my opinion).<br />
<br />
The sound design is something that also (for the most part) stays consistent from the TV series. The sounds of guns, objects clashing, magic spells going off, and other things in the forefront of the action sounds right at home. The voice actors are...well they are what they were in the TV series (which means they were passable). It&#039;s not that the actors did a meh job; it&#039;s just that the TV series and the film doesn&#039;t fully utilize the great cast. They kind of are just there doing their lines. The music is a mixed bag. There are a couple really cool themes. However, there are enough songs that sound either out of place or just really meh that it left a bad taste in my mouth. <br />
<br />
Now we can finally talk about the meat of this film; the...”plot”. On first inspection you might find that the plot lies between Honoka&#039;s breasts. Nope, the plot is introduced as a sort of “Scientists going rouge” thing but it doesn&#039;t really go anywhere. The main...”Villian” is a scientist that...you know what? I still have no idea what the fuck he wanted. He just spouts out these cryptic lines all the time that don&#039;t mean anything other than “I don&#039;t care; just do what I said”. The last time we see him he is (what I am assuming) just knocked out. What happens to him? The film doesn&#039;t care.<br />
<br />
What does the film care about? Fan service. Yes I do mean sexualized fanservice but also fanservice in the way of “Hey viewer! Remember this character? Yeah there she is for 10 minutes! Look how fucking cute/hott she looks in that bathing suit! Ok now say good bye to them because the plot doesn&#039;t need them.” The TV series did a great job keeping characters relevant for the entirety of its running. The film however throws them in because...the studio is worried you will forget about them? Seriously only Tatsuya, Miyuki, Erika, and Leonhart really matter in this film. Everyone else plays a super sideline role. <br />
<br />
So things happen, Tatsuya saves some kids, the sideliners fight some “American” bad guys, then Tatsuya stops a falling thing from space. That&#039;s...pretty much the meat of the film. The first 40 minutes are wasted on meaningless fanservice shots sprinkled with some plot. This film was seriously a letdown. I was hoping it would provide us with some more badass moments but in the end it is all show and no go. There were no real set-piece moments, no real interesting methodical ideas or plot devices, no character development...nothing. Just an hour and a half wasted.<br />
<br />
This film joins No Game No Life Zero in the “film that wasted potential” bin. Please do not waste your time on this thing. Unless you absolutely need to see the characters do something new, stay clear of this mess of a film.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3.2/10<br />
<br />
Overall: 2.5/10<br />

    It&#039;s a really long but detailed summary of the movie and how i feel. TL:DRs and pros and cons are at the top but for the absolute detail, read the whole thing. May contain a bit of accidental spoilers but most likely not.<br />
<br />
TL:DR: Unless you are extremely attentive to all the details, most of its shortcomings are acceptable. It&#039;s a genuinely pleasing movie that i would recommend. Lacks story and character depths but makes up for it with punchy bright fighting scenes and explosives. And also naked girls. I feel that this anime was more focused on the thrilling area rather than story thus. But

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256957">
        it was good enough to not make me bother too much about it.<br />
<br />
Who i would recommend to: Action and thrill seekers, people who want to have a glimpse of the series. <br />
<br />
Pros: Great fighting scenes, artwork and colour was on point, audio was great for most part, really thrilling and funny, more than sufficient to keep me attentive. Fanservice was good and not too excessive (really hot) Didn&#039;t felt like it lacked much. <br />
<br />
Cons: Lack of depth in character,  lack of focus in other characters (felt they were missing out), too focused on main character (feels like a one man mission). Story was shallow compared to the competition but generally average at best. <br />
<br />
Gribes (Little details):<br />
<br />
Some panning inconsistencies and frame rate dropping when panning across complicated scenes. Audio still falls for the issue of just blurring out BG sound and feels too focused in an open area. Slight softness in characters and fighting scenes. <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
(Full review)<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
<br />
In general the movie was fast paced, maybe just a little too fast on its feet to provide in depth explanation of what&#039;s going on but overall I didn&#039;t feel like it was too lacking. This anime felt like it was heavily relying on the fighting scenes and thriller so i wouldn&#039;t be too harsh on other areas. <br />
<br />
The motive of the series was clear right from the start and the dangers was shown without me being too confused. Typical comedy scenes that were actually funny, famservice wasn&#039;t really asked for but still nice i guess especially for the fans. I wish there was more depth in explaning pretty much anything that would have benefitted, felt most were just hurried over. For instance going in depth on what drove them into doing something like this (Mainly destroying the world) rather than a brief explanation. Really would have bring out the sheer humiliation and passion. <br />
<br />
The issue really comes in as I&#039;ll explain later, the excessive focus on the main character and just ignoring everything else. It felt like this whole movie was a one man effort. Impressive until you realized, wait a minute, what about the other few characters that agreed to help too. Major problem for that one as it&#039;s rather obvious. However most of it&#039;s shortcomings were sufficient enough and most of its shortcomings were covered by fanservice, comedy and the extremely good fighting scenes. <br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
<br />
So this is where i focus on things like colour accuracy, smoothness of frames, artwork design, panning of scenes, POV  and also even boobs jiggle. A lot to cover. And i can say for 95% of people, it&#039;s pretty much on par with the best of the best. <br />
<br />
Colour accuracy was mainly spot on with night scenes giving a very accurate greenish blue tone and warm summer sun to portray a warm yellow tone. Slight quibble about miyuki&#039;s skin having a tad less yellow than i would like during the day but was still visible. (10/10)<br />
<br />
Smoothness and panning was for most part decent but falls under some of the common anime issues. Like panning through buildings often have a studder that may seem distracting after awhile. A common issue of 20fps or so. However panning between less complex objects like skies were butter smooth. Fighting scenes do have the slight studder but it wasn&#039;t too bad for me to get my head off. Great overall, slight problem in some scenes but are very common anyways in every other anime. (8/10)<br />
<br />
Focus shift between characters was a bit of a mix bag. There was a combination of a smooth focal change (like a camera, my favorite kind), slingshots (extremely fast panning) and &quot;pop&quot; (No animation). I wished the slingshot pan when the characters were agreeing to help the little kid out was a bit slower as it felt too fast and i sometimes struggle to focus. It was rather inconsistent as i do see these a lot of effort placed in the first half of the anime. However down to the second half, it was just basically &quot;pop&quot; left. Not a big deal but it feels maybe a tad bit lazier. (8/10)<br />
<br />
POV was the best part of it as i feel that the movie had extremely great POVs especially the first half. The night scene combined multiple POVs and did not just heavily rely on close up shots of the character that most anime just generally have. (10/10)<br />
<br />
Boobs jiggle i am happy to report is there to an extent. It was slightly stiffer (less jiggle) than what i would have call it natural for most scenes but in scenes that are intended for fanservice, it was sufficient portrayed without the &quot;nekopara&quot; kind of excessive jiggle. (9/10)<br />
<br />
Character artwork was mostly like the anime so it was great. Slight gribes about some characters having a really soft look when two or more characters are involved but really that&#039;s hard peeping. Most if not all of the characters were clean and sharp with clear edges and outline. (10/10)<br />
<br />
Sharpness of other details were plentyful but fast moving objects have occasional softness and blur. Like the fighting scene had soft edges but were plenty punchy and colourful. But then again most fighting anime suffer these issues. The numbers that pop up along with the blue glow when magic was used were also rather soft and could be a lot sharper. However for most objects, it was only having a soft outline but was still plenty sharp. Signboards and clothing was detailed and visible, maybe a bit lacking in texture but that&#039;s almost impossible to ask. Colour gradients may sometimes smudge a little bit. (9/10)<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
<br />
This is where i focus on coversation, BG noise, music and sound effects.<br />
<br />
Most of the audio were spot on, the 1 point was again my gribe about animes having too much of that focus effect where there&#039;s no BG noise when the character is talking or the environment feels very small. <br />
<br />
Music was spot on, i was a bit amazed that the movie decided to use recorder music (was it? recorder or flute?) instead of the traditional light fluffy music that I am used to hearing in shopping scenes. Wasn&#039;t bad, in fact good, just surprised. Sound effects were generally punchy and loud with explosions having great uniformity but my gribe on the lack of echo as the explosion disspipates. Ice sounded sharp and crisp, sword sounded sharp maybe with a slight bit lacking in the extremely high end. The deep rumble of helicopter and the brrrrrt of the gun, the muffled rumble of the submarine, all well done. (10/10)<br />
<br />
Speech wise was well done. Although more exaggeration is really welcome like the spunds of desperation could have been a bit sharper and more distorted on the tone rather than a very clean voice but minor gribe. The crazy crackle was well covered with a slightly noticable faster speech compared to everyone else. Fighting scenes would have benefited from the slight exaggeration too, it all feels a bit too calm but still on par with the competition like SAO. The sound of fear could be a bit higher pitched and distorted when being asked to be saved and in other cases, a bit more distorted and softer. But these are minor gribes. The movie has well balanced speech with distinct difference at different time and scene. (Can tell the person&#039;s mood and scene just from listening) (10/10)<br />
<br />
Characters: 6 <br />
<br />
Now here&#039;s my stance. I don&#039;t really care too much about characters in movies partly because if i want in depth coverage of every character, just watch the anime but it has to be decently covered. <br />
<br />
So most of the characters were sort of covered. I won&#039;t say too in depth but I&#039;ll give it to them, there were too many to cover. Characters felt quite shallow especially for crucial characters which needed that extra depth to really bring out things like sympathy (But then again, watch the anime for more depth) A simple backstory or reflection of what happened and what they&#039;ve gone through for some crucial characters (not necessarily main characters) would have sufficed. Decent but not great. (7/10)<br />
<br />
It also fell for the trap of focusing too much on the main character and just removing everyone else. That&#039;s one thing I am genuinely annoyed by but not too much to hate it. It&#039;s too focused on the main character. It felt rushed and not well covered. It often felt like a one man mission when there were many people were actually part of the mission. There was little coverage of what the other characters were doing. (6/10)<br />
<br />
It&#039;s interesting enough for first timers and for many of the 7 million fans out there, I am pretty sure you know the BG of every character. It&#039;s only good enough but not great.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9 <br />
<br />
Despite its flaws, the series was fast paced enough to not bore me but have some occasional lack of depth. The fighting scenes were intense, the comedy was really funny. It really is funny despite not being a comedy anime and it has enough action and thriller to keep me entertained. I never once felt like this anime was lacking. As enjoyment itself, only minor annoyance like a lack of depth was basically covered by the interesting fighting scenes i came to watch. And the fanservice just makes me forget about it. Of course but who dares to admit that even. Lmao. The only major gribe i had was too much focus on the main character. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
Great anime, on a technical aspect, it&#039;s a decent series, it does well as a movie and holds its ground. It&#039;s funny, it&#039;s active, it&#039;s thriiling. Issues like depth was bad but excusable since it&#039;s a movie and not an anime. I say, if you are a fan, this is a great movie that reflects part of it. For first timers, this doesn&#039;t reflect the series but a tiny snippet of it that makes you want to watch the anime.

    After watching the most enjoyable season 1, I just had to make my way to watching the movie!<br />
<br />
And I have zero regrets! 8-Bit did a good job with the new art style and I loved it! The anime is filled with much more action scenes and every character looks beautiful!<br />
<br />
The action scenes were intense, well animated and is SUBARASHII!<br />
<br />
We get to see pretty cool fights from almost all our beloved characters at least the main ones from season 1 including Jūmonji, Saegusa, Tatsuya etc<br />
<br />
Some new characters like the USNA magicians ‘Stars’ were introduced but not that is really matters if you know them, they just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293755">
        add to the intensity of the fight scenes which is awesome!<br />
<br />
Along with the USNA, Lina is also introduced! If you read the LN, Lina is affiliated with the Shiba siblings and is a very strong and beautiful magician like Miyuki!<br />
<br />
-Spoilers Start-<br />
<br />
The story revolves around illegal experiments on children to create strong magic sequences that can annihalate an entire city in an instant. The USNA noticing it as a threat, sent ‘Stars’ an elite group to Japan to exterminate the threat. Lina, the beautiful commander of Stars used a high level magic and destroyed half the island where the experiments were conducted and coincidentally met Tatsuya and his friends as they were saving the experimented children. They eventually work together to stop the huge threat that was resulted from a failure in the experiment.<br />

-Spoilers End-<br />
<br />
TL;DR<br />
Saegusa and Miyuki looks gorgeous as usual<br />
Tatsuya is freakin’ badass as usual<br />
Super cool fight scenes<br />
Jūmonji is on fire!<br />
GARNIDELLA SPEED STAR<br />
Lina was introduced &lt; waifu material<br />
<br />
Lolis and child experiments<br />
<br />
Oh and hints on a purple hair girl that will definitely intrigue you to read the LN afterwards!<br />

    While I love the show, this movie literally takes everything wrong with the show and ramps it up to eleven. Plot holes are more than left and right, and a lot of things just don’t make sense, as it wasn’t properly explained. <br />
<br />
To make things worse the runtime of the movie could fit the size of the shows typical arc so it’s sad to see something I really enjoy in general fall so flat and just wishing there was more and better substance. The fights which occurred were pretty disappointing overall as it felt the short fights themselves could be solved if someone just spoke

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270269">
        a single sentence of explaining themselves. <br />
<br />
Though I will admit I loved the after credit scene which simply made me nostalgic for the original show.<br />
<br />
To sum up: Stick to the show. Overall rating is a 5.

    It&#039;s... ok.<br />
<br />
Not unexpectedly good nor unexpectedly bad.<br />
<br />
-<br />

If you&#039;ve watched the anime, it isn&#039;t that much different except it looks nicer. But while the anime is part of a overarching storyline, this movie is kind of a standalone thing. So you&#039;d be wise to not expect anything important or very fleshed out characters or exciting storyline.<br />
Really though, I didn&#039;t really care for the movie storyline or new characters. But I think that&#039;s fine as it&#039;s within my expectations. If you did like the anime you&#039;re probably just here for the ride, the main cast + some Tatsuya/Miyuki/etc OPness. If you just expect that, the movie is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256881">
        kind of alright.<br />
Sadly as a pretty short movie, you don&#039;t get to enjoy the character interactions very much, since the time is spent on the movie storyline. But you at least get to see the main characters in some form, even if they don&#039;t all get to do much.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re an anime-only watcher though, you&#039;ll definitely be confused when flashbacks of the past are referenced, and when characters that haven&#039;t yet appeared in anime appear without any introduction, and you&#039;re expected to know them. However, it&#039;s not critical to the plot for this movie and it&#039;s ok to go in blind. They are also not major spoilers and should not hamper your enjoyment should there be a anime season 2. It does not change the level of enjoyment much, it&#039;s just a extra tidbit for those who know what it is. Just keep in mind that there will seem to be some unexplained minor things. Also, THE POST-CREDIT SCENE IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
As a novel reader, I think the movie as a whole feels like a side story. As usual only the combat characters really do anything, but the starting is slice of life-y which is somewhat enjoyable. Those scenes of them just walking around weren&#039;t too bad. The new characters of the movie, and the main storyline isn&#039;t really well fleshed out at all - but it doesn&#039;t matter right? We&#039;re just here to see the characters move and do some moves. However I wouldn&#039;t say the combat is spectacular either, but still if you&#039;re a fan I think it&#039;ll be enjoyable as long as you don&#039;t expect to be blown away.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Overall, movie characters not really developed, but enjoyable if you don&#039;t care about that and just wanna see the main characters again. You might not feel like you get enough of them in this short movie to make it worth it though. Usual Tatsuya OPness though not so much of the badass factor I&#039;m looking for. The shortness of the movie really makes it difficult to do much, so we pretty much just get a little of everything and nothing extra great.<br />
As far as movies go, decent art but music isn&#039;t particularly impressive. Movie characters not well developed despite being the trigger for everything, but works as a plot device to get our characters moving. Main characters and enjoyment are the usual.<br />
<br />
Not a must-see by any means. But a good way to pass time and enjoy the movie feel Treat it as a long ova/side story and you&#039;ll be set.

    The story is set after Season 1, during their spring break just before they get into their 2nd year in high school. The whole group were on their holidays having the time of their lives. When they went to visit the nearby Ogasawara Island archipelago, they met with an unexpected guest which turns their peaceful life around. Compared to the anime series, I actually enjoyed this movie much more.<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
The plot was pretty straight forward right from the beginning allowing you to kind of guess where the story is headed. The movie has a good pacing, with interesting scenes and minimal info dumps about how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256536">
        Tatsuya magically knows everything and explains it. However, there is a scene that made me felt disappointed and confused seeing how the characters involved are not utilising their abilities properly. It just felt that the spotlight was forced to be on Tatsuya just because he is the main character.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
The artwork I felt was fantastic allowing some of the scenes at the end to be mesmerizing. The artwork of the fighting scene I felt was topnotch and really captures my attention. The designs for the characters are pretty cool and they look great wearing clothes other than their uniforms. Won’t really say too much except that I enjoyed what I saw. <br />
<br />
Sounds: 8/10<br />
Personally to me some of the dialogues at the beginning were pretty pointless and doesn’t build up the story in any particular way. Tatsuya just had to say something that everyone is just going to disagree anyway. The voice actors for each characters were great as it doesn’t feels out of place or awkward. I won’t judge about the OST as I’m not really familiar with music although I did enjoyed it nonetheless. <br />

Characters: 3/10<br />
Most of the characters barely got enough screen time, leaving some of them just showing their face for the sake of the show and fan service because they are side characters. New characters were introduced but never really explained how they knew each other. They felt forceful just to have the actions scenes and conflict occurring as their motives wasn’t strong enough. However, the action scenes for the characters in the movie is enticing enough to make me crave for more of it. This is definitely the highlight for me as the supporting characters got a chance to shine for a moment. Finally, I got really confused that both Miyuki and Saegusa had an ability that they shouldn’t possibly have. Did they leveled up? How did they learn those particular skills? <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
Although I did enjoyed myself throughout the movie despite the few questions I had in my mind, I never did see any plot development for the future season nor do I see the characters grow at all. I don’t really see the point of having this movie without it developing itself. You can probably still enjoy this movie without watching the anime series because of it. Also there is one ending credit scene so remember to stay back. <br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10<br />
If you are a fan of an OP main character, don&#039;t mind some light bro-con, love irregular at magic high school then I would recommend you to try this out. <br />

    I&#039;ve been a fan of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei for quite a bit, even if I didn&#039;t read the novels and stayed with the manga and anime.<br />
<br />
First off, I&#039;ll be quick because other reviews go more in depth.<br />
<br />
This film is clearly NOT the direct following of the anime and doesn&#039;t appear in the manga, so it&#039;s a side-story which is quite enjoyable, taking place during the vacations.<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
The story is ..ok?... but quite simple in the end. When I say simple, I also mean that you can clearly feel the shonen wibe behind the interactions and it&#039;s really easy to understand the story. (So it&#039;s quite

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273071">
        lighthearted without the &quot;POWER OF FRIENDS&quot; part of the shonen shows.... but lighthearted in the wrong direction, leading to situations with no sense at all because the logic disappeared in the stratosphere...)<br />
<br />
ART:<br />
The art is GREAT, you can&#039;t argue with that. It&#039;s not as good as Violet Evergarden or Ghibli films, but it&#039;s still in the right continuation from the series with overall better graphics, but a better spirit. You can feel that it&#039;s a movie and not a TV series with lack of time. The CGI is quite well used, or used in the background, so it doesn&#039;t scratch your eyes.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
The characters are like before (in the TV series), but with little to no character developpment for the ones we already get to see in the previous anime AND characters appearing way later in the novel/manga series (which will not be presented, so it&#039;s kind of laking for the people coming from the anime TV part).<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
The sound was ok, but not particularly good or memorable. It just did it&#039;s job without giving a special wibe or atmosphere, which is kind of sad.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
The movie is nice. If you liked the anime series, you&#039;ll definitely like this movies... and if you are a big fan and you read the manga/novel, you&#039;ll probably like it even more.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: (8/10 for MAL, 8,2/10 precisely)<br />
This movie is laking a great sountrack and a better character introduction, but in the end, it was quite what I was expecting from a mahouka-movie. It wasn&#039;t a masterpiece, it wasn&#039;t GREAT in capital letters, but it was enjoyable... and more enjoyable than most of the current movies coming out in the regular cinema industry.<br />
People coming from the anime series ONLY will have scenes they don&#039;t understand, because they don&#039;t know the characters, which are introduced a bit later in the original series.<br />
<br />
If you liked MKNR, I definetly recommend you to give it a shot. The animation is still great and Tatsuya is present (without him, the movie wouldn&#039;t exist after all, he&#039;s kind of the main character).<br />
<br />
Hopefully, this quick review was helpful.<br />
<br />
(Note: for me, 7/10 is the average not of an anime which hasn&#039;t really hardcore flaws. If everything is decent, the anime will get an 7/10 from me. 8/10 is already way better and 9/10 is nearing the realm of masterpieces.)

    A Busman&#039;s Holiday for Tatsuya Shiba...<br />
<br />
The Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei series for LA at least is a very flawed yet oddly popular anime for LA, from it&#039;s long winded exposition about magic, to an overpowered main protagonist and LA doesn&#039;t even want to get started with it&#039;s incest subtexts and everything..soo yeah LA had some problems with the anime series, so how does the movie Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Movie: Hoshi wo Yobu Shoujo differ from it?...well...it&#039;s more like a sins of the father situation for this movie.<br />
<br />
Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Movie: Hoshi wo Yobu Shoujo follows a basic three act structure, of setup, confrontation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270951">
        and resolution, in which it involves a human experiment runaway by the name of Kokoa wanting to free her other &quot;8&quot;, with Tatsuya accepting it, until some other factions comes into the loop, then well it becomes all chaos not long afterwards bringing our confrontation to not only the &quot;villain&quot; of this movie but the other factions with their own agenda to deal with and then the resolution to the movie shortly afterwards. <br />
<br />
LA will say this loud and clear for you about the &quot;sins of the father&quot; affecting this movie and that&#039;s the problem of Tatsuya Shiba himself, merely for the fact that he&#039;s is an overpowered main protagonist easily cuts the tension of MANY scenes in this movie, not the mention the fact that he steals scenes from his friends in the process of this movie for the sake of trying to protect them. Erika and Leo are half-exceptions however let&#039;s not kid ourselves, Tatsuya on a large scale pretty much resolves EVERY problem in this movie and being the &quot;Magic Jesus&quot; LA dubbed him he destroys any tension of an imminent threat that the movie had setup for us. Now to this movie&#039;s defence, yes LA gets he&#039;s the &quot;main protagonist&quot; thus his screentime is somewhat justified not to mention some battles that doesn&#039;t affect Tatsuya like Erika and Leo&#039;s fight against some of the Elite STARS and Miyuki&#039;s role by the climax of the movie were somewhat unaffected by this, what LA just had a problem with is that he STEALS the screentime from the other main characters of this movie in the process of it because he&#039;s just so damn powerful in the first place!.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation done this time by 8Bit instead of MADHOUSE, the animation is very polished and bright in flavour of the TV series only to a bigger scale, the magic battles and it&#039;s aesthetics is also very well done showing off some spectacularly great effects, kinda expected from 8Bit for this one however LA will talk about something that irked LA because of this but that a bit later.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is overall consistent with returning voice actors from Saori Hayami to Kana Hanazawa, Satomi Sato, Marina Inoue, Yuuichi Nakamura, Yumi Uchiyama. With some new additions to this movie from Yoko Hikasa as Lina and Konomi Kohara as Kokoa did pretty well overall as well. Really not much to talk about with the voice cast really.<br />
<br />
So in talking about Lina, how did Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Movie: Hoshi wo Yobu Shoujo handle their newer characters?, well Kokoa was nothing but the plot catalyst while Lina and the STARS to Tatsuya were used for some opposition and a bit of chaos to ramp up the craziness of the movie, LA was fine with Lina being in the movie if only to cause a bit of a wall for Tatsuya, Erika and Leo while yeah...LA had a problem with Kokoa as a whole of her being a &quot;catalyst&quot; to the entire movie and LA gets Kokoa purpose IS to move the plot along but yeah show stealer Tatsuya made short work of that anyways.<br />
<br />
For fans of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, the Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Movie: Hoshi wo Yobu Shoujo is for what LA sees, is a 90 minute episode of one particular arc (and it&#039;s NOT an original work so this is canon). For LA personally, what with LA being griped about Tatsuya Shiba for MULTITUDE of reasons, the animation being one of the highlights of the movie. What LA really got out of this movie, though it&#039;s faithful both aesthetically and atmospheric to the TV series and everything, it also brought on for LA that this movie is really a &quot;spectacle over substance&quot; movie, you get a mission, exposition and prep over it then conduct and confront then resolve the mission...lots of gorgeously spectacle magical battles and explosions...but not much to &quot;say&quot; about it all and that&#039;s where LA thinks Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Movie: Hoshi wo Yobu Shoujo falls flat on. <br />
<br />
Now in saying all this, is this just like the anime original movies with it&#039;s movie only characters that goes away afterwards, it definitely has hints of being so even if this is canon to the original source material, however Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Movie: Hoshi wo Yobu Shoujo does for LA at least make the spectacle kinda worth the watch even with it&#039;s very flawed negatives. <br />
<br />
All of the elements of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Movie: Hoshi wo Yobu Shoujo, a spectacle over substance, a sins of the father anime series to movie problems and all, the movie is fine...it&#039;s fine...it&#039;s fine.

    Nothing professional; Just expressing my thoughts and impressions after finishing the movie.<br />
<br />
To begin with, I was extremely hyped for the movie. Even though it had a separate story from the LN (or so I remember reading about it), I was hoping for some great story developments, considering where the LNs go and develop as I&#039;ve heard. I wanted to re-watch the original series because it was a blast, it was very well-balanced for me, and triggered a ton of emotions, because of which - I wanted to see even more of the story, it kinda ended on a moment that I knew would develop further,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270834">
        and it does in LNs anyways. <br />
But this wasn&#039;t really to my liking. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love the anime, even to this day I search for similar anime to it. But the thoughts I had towards it after the ending were just mixed.<br />
Why I had mixed feelings?<br />
   - The plot didn&#039;t really connect. I simply imply that the first season was to provide interest into the LN, and the creation of the movie probably means that you have read the LN beforehand, or they expected you to. <br />
   - Because of the previous statement, if you don&#039;t like LNs, don&#039;t read them or just didn&#039;t read this one or such, you might get lost. New characters, new people, new information and some old information you probably have forgotten can be confusing and most likely will be.<br />
   - It is more like a side-story because it is not really related to the main-story. This takes place at the time of the spring break - which basically means that this is more like an OVA, and it is, because of the time as I said, and the ending which feels more like an ending to an OVA before a second season. Except we don&#039;t get one. And it feels like a cliff-hanger because it just feels that there has to be the rest of it, it just covers the spring break.<br />
   - Raises some questions that you might not be able to answer without reading the LNs, asking others or trying to find out by yourself somewhere.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, I still advise you to watch it. If you&#039;re reading this, you are most likely are someone who have watched the first season, liked it, and wanted to see more. It still provides you:<br />
   - Many action scenes, Tatsuya&#039;s godlike powers, strategies (although they&#039;re less in-depth than usual), onii-sama boners.<br />
   - Great visuals, amazing quality. The fights are very well done, it is basically eye-candy. <br />
   - The whole squad ready to accompany our MC in various fights and adventures. His knowledge on everything is what I love about him - he is versatile &#039;cause he has a huge range of practices and knowledge.<br />
<br />
I would also read the LNs if you were someone who likes reading - I myself am very curious and helping oneself to calm that curiosity is the best medicament for that.

    It is difficult to construct a new world with your imagination that does not contain contradiction. We are still discovering our very own reality. It is insane to ask an author to construct a world without holes. While the original anime  is meh in this department, the light novel in my opinion did a good enough job explaining things. This movie is shit in this department compared to the original anime even if you consider it without the explanation from light novel. I understand that this movie is original story. It does not really concern itself with the fine details of the light novel.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272794">
        It merely use some characters and &quot;technology&quot; from the light novel and attempt to construct something new. What is the intended audience of this movie? Anime only audience would not even have heard of Lina... Inserting this movie into the plot of the light novel would require a complete rewrite of significant part of the light novel.  Yeah let&#039;s blow up USA&#039;s military satellite and nothing is going to happen. The story is fucking pathetic. Everything else is good.

    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start with my main issue. Set after volume 11 of the light novels, the anime ends with volume 7, Hoshi wo Yobu Shoujo suffers from poor character building, a broken story line and poor pacing... This movie&#039;s release should have waited for after the release of a second season of the anime, or included an extra 30 minutes  or so of character and background building... The target audience may be those have read the light novels, but a large proportion of the possible audience have likely not. Reading a novel is very different to reading a manga, let alone watching an anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273715">
        / movie...<br />
<br />
For the breakdown, the overall plot was weak and though it is canon, does little to contribute to the overarching story. To me this almost feels like filler that has been aired before the void it was trying to fill even exists... This carries over to the characters. We are provided next to no background regarding the motives of Miyuki and Tatsuya except for a short flashback, which unless you&#039;ve read volume 8, may create more questions then it answers. We&#039;re also &quot;meet&quot; Lina, and related factions but are given no insight into their backgrounds nor their familiarity with the cast we know. Without the introduction covered in volumes 9-11, we know next to nothing about Lina and that remains till the end of the movie...<br />
<br />
If you&#039;ve read up to volume 11 of the light novels, I&#039;d say you&#039;d enjoy it as many of the holes are somewhat resolved. In this case, I&#039;d rate the movie a 8. If you haven&#039;t, then unless you&#039;re satisfied with a bit of fan service and some interesting but poorly paced action, I&#039;d say give it a miss, for now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ling.

    tl;dr: A very well designed but very much filler movie.<br />
<br />
This is essentially a filler movie in the universe of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Movie: Hoshi wo Yobu Shoujo. As with such movies its completely self contained and doesn&#039;t really further anything in terms of overarching plot points or character arcs. Rather, it&#039;s a short story far away from everything else. This story is more focused on lots of cool and fun moments than on telling a solid story, wherein while it does have a reasonably solid story it&#039;s a pretty generic one that doesn&#039;t have that much complexity or depth to it. However, it does

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353914">
        have a lot of amusing moments that manage to pull in the entire cast from the main series, even though that does feel kind of forced, as well as a lot of great action and epic moments. The protagonist Tatsuya is still essentially invincible and able to solve any problem, but it feels like there was a different tone taken around that, wherein in the first season such moments were intended to wow the viewer, here it just felt like they were being portrayed as a matter of course, which I think minimizes such moments to a degree. The biggest, or rather strangest issue that I had with this anime is how it was released. This film was released after the first season, however there&#039;s an entire arc between the end of the first season and where this movie takes place, and that isn&#039;t just a superficial aspect but rather this film very clearly has references to events that haven&#039;t been shown in the anime yet, and straight up has characters that are introduced after the anime ends that are already familiar to the main cast, which is just a really bizarre choice because this is filler anyway and they had complete control of where they were putting it. Still, it&#039;s not that hard to follow whats going on due to the pretty simplistic plot, so that isn&#039;t that much of an issue, though for those that aren&#039;t familiar with the novels it&#039;ll spoil a few things that should have been twists in season 2. The art and animation quality were excellent and a major step above the first season. The soundtrack was also just as solid as the first season. The ED was also good and really fitting.

    it&#039;s a pretty mediocre story and this is coming from a person who is in deep love with the light novels this movie is just a fan service for mahouka fan showcasing their favourite characters in action. this contains spoilers.<br />
<br />
<br />
The story:<br />
<br />
The worse thing about the movie is the story, the story is bland, I didn&#039;t feel attached to kokoa at all, only sympathetic which is natural giving she was subject to inhumane scientific research, but other than that, she&#039;s pretty bland (I&#039;ll give her a break since she was imprisoned since birth), still she&#039;s a bad character. She&#039;s a plot device at best, to make

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363666">
        the story progresses, I expected she would have a bigger role in the story but she never even interacted with Tatsuya who is the main progtag.<br />
<br />
The story felt rushed and forced, it felt it only had one plot point, no subplots, no emotional moments apart from the ending when kokoa smiled at Tatsuya, no memorable moments either.<br />
<br />
<br />
the animation:<br />
<br />
the animation is very good, the action scene were well animated, the new studio did a good job, probably because a lot of people who worked on season 1 of the anime, also worked for this movie.<br />
<br />
music<br />
<br />
I love mahouka music/ost in general, they are great.<br />
<br />
<br />
over all<br />
I wanted to give this a 6, but since I&#039;m a huge fan of mahouka, I&#039;ll raise it to 7.<br />

    Review: Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Movie: Hoshi wo Yobu Shoujo English version The irregular at magic high school The Movie: The Girl Who Summons the Stars<br />
<br />
The artwork and overall animation of the movie has a higher quality than we got with the anime series. I suspect that this was driven by the final viewing format more than a design for higher quality. But I can say that the movement and lines are much smoother and more natural.<br />
<br />
I am shooting for spoiler-free and that will be the largest challenge in this review. Let’s start with this is a good follow up for the series as it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346797">
        continues the main cast and brings in more of the background of this world. Post World War III magic is the key to everything and our main Protagonist Tatsuya Shiba is as overpowered as ever with his super-powered sister Miyuki they are on summer vacation with the cast from the first season of the anime.<br />
<br />
It is safe to say that this is also a look into the world of the rich. The villa they are staying at is on a private island. They have maid staff and both a private plane and a boat. The quality of the food etc. is well above what we would call standard fare. For fun they fly over to an entertainment island venue I not really jealous but will admit to some envy. This is where they meet little Kokoa as she hides on the airplane they are using.<br />
<br />
Kokoa is a victim of human experiments and she is not alone. She explains that she and eight other girls are being used as part of a big machine. Tatsuya explains that it is probably a giant CAD and that the magic users are being forcibly linked. This has a danger of stripping the humanity of the person and turning them into nothing but a component to the tool. Human parts to a machine with no rights no life and no future.<br />
<br />
As you can imagine this is not going to stand and a plan is put in place to deal with the problem. We get cameo appearances from several of the graduates from the prior season with Mayumi Saegusa, Mari Watanabe, and Katsuto Jumonji all playing a roll in the rescue. We also get to meet the “Stars” Team from the United States a girl much like Tatsuya who has some tactical grade powers of her own Angelina Kudou Shields aka Lina.<br />
<br />
I will not go into the events of the story or the rescue from here as that takes all the fun out of it. If you enjoyed the overpowered type then this should work for you. If you enjoy watching a Brocon sister then this will work for you also
