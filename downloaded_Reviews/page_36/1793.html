However, for me personally, I was on the tail end of those shows&#039; airtime, only catching the Majin Buu saga and reruns of the first few episodes of other shows. I didn&#039;t come in at the beginning, so it wasn&#039;t like starting a brand new adventure, and it wasn&#039;t until around 2005 that I first got to experience the start of a brand new story, and that story, of course, was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200936">
        Naruto, an epic reinterpretation of ninjas combined with the superpower action/adventure style of DBZ and other shounen tropes, though of course I had no idea what shounen was at the time. Now, after over a decade of popularity in the US, and half a decade more in Japan, the last story in the Naruto-verse has finally been told.<br />
<br />
Several years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto has finally become the Seventh Hokage, and a time of peace and prosperity has descended upon the Leaf Village. However, this time our focus is not on Naruto, but on his son, Boruto, a young ninja desperately seeking the attention of his father, who has become overwhelmed with his duties as Hokage and barely has time to spend with his family anymore. Through his trials in the lead-up to the Chunin Exams, as well as a mysterious new villain making an appearance, Boruto attempts to garner his father&#039;s attention and force him to recognize his exceptional talent as a shinobi and give him the attention he so desperately craves.<br />
<br />
Much like Naruto: The Last, we&#039;ve moved past simply adding a new villain for our favorite characters to fight against, and instead the main focus of this movie is on the emotional turmoil that Boruto and Naruto have to work through in their strained father-son relationship. This part of the story is pretty straightforward and basic, though that&#039;s really all that it needs to be. Naruto doesn&#039;t have time to spend with his son, so Boruto gets angry and hates his dad&#039;s guts, yet still tries his best to get his dad to notice him. In terms of the franchise&#039;s history, Boruto is actually a fairly weak-willed main character at times and gives up a lot more easily than his father ever did, though this still seems to work because, rather than not having anyone in the first place like Naruto, or having his family taken from him like Sasuke, he instead feels abandoned by a father who is still technically there but doesn&#039;t pay enough attention, causing him to essentially lose hope that his situation will ever get better, and when he does finally start seeing reassurance from his father after Boruto starts making more headway in the ninja world, he subconsciously rebounds and does everything he can to keep his dad&#039;s attention, even if his methods start to deviate from the shinobi way. In a way, this sort of echoes Sasuke&#039;s history, which kind of makes sense since Sasuke is Boruto&#039;s mentor for a good portion of the film, and at times it almost feels like Boruto sees Sasuke as someone to fill the void left by his barely-there father, though this idea isn&#039;t explored too much in the film. The overall arc of Boruto&#039;s character is probably the best part of this film, as it reaches a satisfying conclusion in the final act.<br />
<br />
As for Naruto, this is probably the most difficult part of the story to convey to the audience, since they have to make Naruto look extremely busy without making him act like a douche to his family, and with the exception of a few lines, they manage to do that fairly well. You can definitely see that he&#039;s become overloaded and exhausted from his work as Hokage, and also that he&#039;s still trying to find time to spend with his family, although failing miserably. There are a few moments in the beginning though where the strictness he&#039;s adopted as the Hokage seems to be a bit too forced for his character and ends up making him look a bit uncaring, which is hardly the kind of trait you would expect from Naruto.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of the cast, most of them are fairly solid. I ended up liking Sarada a lot more than I thought I would since she ends up being an interesting support character for Boruto in sharing similar elements of their parental situations. I do wish they had explored her more in this movie, but I suppose that&#039;s what Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring is for. The rest of the characters fill out their own fan service and nostalgia roles pretty nicely, and I didn&#039;t really expect any more than that since it would end up clogging up the main story line. The main villain, unfortunately, is pretty much as generic as they come. Again, anything super-complex would have bogged down the character drama between Boruto and Naruto, but this guy&#039;s about as plain and standard as they come. They try to work him into the already existing shinobi history, which worked out fine in Naruto: The Last, but it feels like too much of a stretch in this case and a lot of the details feel a bit jumbled and rushed.<br />
<br />
The new technology they introduce in this film was also a bit odd at times. I&#039;ve always felt that Kishimoto has struggled with balancing how much advanced technology is used in the Naruto universe, and this movie almost fixes that problem by basically showing this giant leap forward in technology, and it even seems to address the debate of whether hard work and willpower or technology and cutting edge tools with spearhead the future of the shinobi world, but it&#039;s still just a tad too jagged and uneven at times.<br />
<br />
As for animation, this is definitely one of the best-looking Naruto films thus far, though I&#039;m not quite sure I would call it the best. The character designs are about as refined and polished as they&#039;ve ever been, though I did notice quite a few draw distance issues. Perhaps this was more a problem with the theater I saw it in...amongst many other problems I had with my particular theater viewing, that will eventually be fixed by the time the Blu-rays come out, but it&#039;s still something worth noting. To my delight, this film does not rely nearly as much on CG environments as previous movies have done, though there are still a few whiffs of that pungent CG stench hanging around. As for the action scenes, once again, it does a lot of things right, and a lot of things not so right. When it gets into the huger scale of things, the choreography and particle physics are outstanding, with tons of vivid colors and unique attack designs, and watching these massive explosions and earth-shattering jutsu go off in everyone&#039;s faces is spectacular to watch. On the other end though, a lot of the smaller, hand-to-hand choreography is a bit disappointing, especially compared to the previous film. There are a few moments where the hand-to-hand gets pretty awesome and some of the more complex strategies and jutsu are fun to watch, but these moments largely fall by the wayside in exchange for a “whoever has the biggest jutsu wins” competition like the latter half of the main Naruto storyline fell into. The very end of the battle did have at least some smartness to it though, so I wasn&#039;t dissatisfied by the ending to a significant degree. Despite its flaws though, this is some of the better work that Studio Pierrot has put out so far, and it&#039;s a great way to view the shinobi world for one last time.<br />
<br />
On the soundtrack end of things, it&#039;s pretty much the same as it&#039;s always been: an epic combination of orchestral and rock compositions with that extra Eastern flavor of shamisen, taiko drums, and bamboo flute that has shaped the Naruto soundtrack&#039;s identity for the past thirteen years. The ending song played during the credits was provided by Kana-Boon and gives us that last burst of excitement as what is most likely the final chapter in the Naruto world comes to a close. Oh by the way, make sure you watch the after-credits scene because it is absolutely something that you do not want to miss.<br />
<br />
Overall, if you go into this movie thinking it&#039;ll be the big final hoorah of the Naruto franchise and that it&#039;s the best story yet, you&#039;ll probably be disappointed. To me, the final climax of Naruto was in Naruto: The Last, if you couldn&#039;t tell from how often I brought it up during this review, and Boruto is more of a fan service/second generation side story that serves as more of a dessert dish rather than the last bite of a spectacular main course. Despite that, though, I still highly recommend that you see this movie if you are a Naruto fan because, despite all its flaws, it&#039;s still probably the last major project that Kishimoto will make for the Naruto franchise, and that&#039;s...kinda sad for me. Even though there are so many other, much better anime out there, Naruto is the one that, for me and thousands, possibly millions of other anime fans, shaped how we viewed anime as we were growing up, and to know that the story is now completely finished is kind of depressing. Sure the TV anime is still going...for some reason, but the manga&#039;s story is completely finished and now there&#039;s this void left behind from a series that&#039;s been a massive part of my life for so long that I can&#039;t even remember what life was like without Naruto. From the first volume to the last, from Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow to Boruto, and the dozens of side stories in-between, this has been one hell of a ride. Knowing that there&#039;s a future without more Naruto is really weird for me, and, in time, perhaps a new franchise will take its place...but, that&#039;s a story for another day.<br />
<br />
For now, I say &quot;Sayonara&quot; to a franchise that, despite its flaws, means more to me than others can possibly imagine.

    I really wanted to review this movie, because it&#039;s officially Kishimoto&#039;s final involvement with the Naruto franchise (if nothing changes, that is) and I wanted to make somewhat of a tribute to this series, that has been part of my life for quite some time.<br />
<br />
Story: 50%<br />
Characters: 30%<br />
Art: 10%<br />
Soundtrack: 10%<br />
<br />
Story (3/5):<br />
The story is nothing special. It&#039;s basically an encore to the series&#039; epilogue and centers around the new generation, that got introduced in the final chapter of the main series. The focus is Naruto&#039;s son Boruto, who is torn between admiring his father as the hokage and rebelling against him for not having any time for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202449">
        his kids. It amounts to a really good first half, but a somewhat cookie cutter second half, that is not without it&#039;s flaws. What threw me off the hype train in the second half, was how much they bothered introducing new characters to rival the likes of Madara and Kaguya. The end product was Momoshiki, who had flashy abilities, but lacked to grab my attention and had too little screen time. I would have preferred it, if they went with a villain of a smaller scale. They could problemlessly pull through Boruto&#039;s conflict, even if they used a weaker antagonist. I mean the antagonists in &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal&quot;, were no way near the threat level of Shishio and some other antagonists of the main series, and yet the film managed to have a good and consistent plot. So why didn&#039;t they do something like that in Boruto? Also [minor spoiler] the lead up to the final battle was too rushed and Boruto fellt out of place in that company. So yeah... if it weren&#039;t for the well animated battles, the second half would have kinda sucked.<br />
<br />
Art (4/5):<br />
The art was pretty good. The battles were fluent and well choreographed. The Sasuke and Naruto VS Momoshiki battle definetly deserves to be mentioned.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack (4/5):<br />
Another pretty good field. In my opinion Naruto always had a great soundtrack. They recycled some songs from the series though.<br />
<br />
Characters (3,5/5):<br />
I guess the main focus is on Boruto, who has daddy issues. A common internal conflict in the Naruto universe and may likely be off putting to some viewers. Personally I didn&#039;t mind it, because I thought it was handled pretty well here (definetly better than in the Sarada manga). Especially interesting were the changes done to Naruto Uzumaki. His characterization in this movie was surprisingly good, considering the fact, that he was a pretty irritating character in the last 200 or so chapters. Here we see him as an actual adult, who no longer shouts around bullsh*t spontaneously and who reflects upon his status as the hokage and a father, hoping he&#039;ll figure out a way to balance the two out. I found this humanization of this &quot;Jesus-esque&quot; character to be one of the more pleasant surprises in this movie. There was also Sasuke, who smiled more in this movie. Also he apparently developed some social skills. So I guess Sasuke was okay. I would have wished to see more mentor/ student chemistry between Sasuke and Boruto though. A minor complaint was how little the other new genin were shown. I really wanted to know more about them.<br />
<br />
Critical score: 6,7/10<br />
+considering enjoyment to round it up to a whole number<br />
<br />
Final score: 7/10

    This is my review on the recent Naruto movie. This movie is by far my favorite. It did have it&#039;s ups and downs, which I will eventually deal with. By the way, expect to be spoiled. <br />
<br />
So this is literally what the Naruto Gaiden manga as led to. We finally get to see the new generation in all it&#039;s glory. We see Naruto fulfilling his dreams, as well as juggling his children, we see the Chunin Exams, as well as Sasuke going in. To be honest everyone gets to shine to an extent....Except TenTen. What I found odd about this story was the villains(Momoshiki and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200872">
        Kinshiki) defeat and Mitsuki&#039;s father. Wish I had received more closure around that fact. The story gets a 10/10.<br />
<br />
-The art and animation are top notch, seriously superb. Why can&#039;t we get this for Shippuden. Either way, I am giving this a 10/10.<br />
<br />
-Characters like Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, Sarada and Boruto got some pretty good development. Boruto being one of them, getting to see the new &quot;Naruto&quot;, however this at first made me think he was a spoiled brat. Going into this movie, I had a massive hatred for this kid. He could have learnt to respect his amazing father. But hey, he eventually learns to respect his father. I mean hell, the job that you dream of doing will always be hard. The main goal for Naruto was to be Hokage. Boruto not understanding that is what got to me. Sakura was impressive. To be honest, I have gained a new respect for her. Sarada has also become one of my favorite heroines in the Naruto series. Sasuke, I have seen amazing things with this guy. He has taken badassery to a whole new level. Training Boruto and even admitting his wrongs. The guy as really grown on me. 9/10<br />
<br />
-Other characters, like the new 4 kage(Darui, Gaara,Kurotsuchi and Chojuro) where rather impressive, they held their own against villains as strong, if not stronger than Kaguya. Shikamaru, Shikadai, Inojin and Mitsuki where characters I held a genuine interest in as well. <br />
<br />
-The villains. The skinny one is known as Momoshiki and the massive one is known as Kinshiki. To be honest, I really loved these villains. They had a strange air to them, which made them feel fitting. Hell they where even better then Kaguya. What I disliked about these villains is the fact that they where defeated with a rasengan. Having Boruto do the job, felt like the torch was being passed though. In the end, it does make sense. Since the villains had lost their ability to adsorb power. I do wish that this was actually manga chapters because of how well these villains where fleshed out. 9/10<br />
<br />
-Enjoyment: I really enjoyed this movie. Seeing Naruto become Hokage and look after his children rather well. Seeing the original team 7, as well as Boruto deciding to become someone like Sasuke, while Sarada becomes Hokage. To be honest, this is what I admire. Not having Boruto follow his father&#039;s footsteps and having Sarada become hokage. <br />
<br />
<br />
Here is a summary:<br />
Story: 10/10, loved it. I did hate Boruto at the beginning. Pacing was also a problem. I wish the characters where fleshed out a bit more.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10 the art is always amazing.<br />
<br />
Character development: 10/10. Sarada and Boruto. As well as Naruto and Sasuke. Almost every character gets some development.<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10. Seeing everyone.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
This was a brilliant send of to the Naruto franchise. The best movie yet.

    Starting with a clever dialogue and moving into an emotional and tension filled story, Boruto delivers some of the best that Naruto has had to offer throughout its original run.<br />
<br />
Boruto picks up marginally after the time skip between the end of the manga and the Naruto movie &quot;The Last.&quot; If you have not seen those two yet, I recommend watching them before Boruto as many references and assumptions are taken from knowing those stories. <br />
<br />
In terms of art and music, Boruto delivered high quality work. The entire film was enjoyable as known melodies from Naruto intertwined with original soundtracks to give the viewer just enough

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201128">
        nostalgia to both enjoy and appreciate the progression of Naruto as a franchise. The art was outstanding as very minimal details were countless and even after watching the film with attention to detail, it is certain that in a second viewing one could get much more out of the subtleties. The fighting sequences were also very craftily created as they were fast paced, dynamic, and heart pumping for a large majority. <br />
<br />
In terms of story, Boruto delivered something different and much needed from Naruto movies; emotional tension over another big &quot;bad guy.&quot; It isn&#039;t to say that Boruto had an absence of a good villain; that was fine, but more so that Boruto focuses much more on the events outside the villain. Instead of using plot as a means to defeat a tough villain, Boruto uses the villain as a tool to further develop the plot which to that point was filled with tension emotionally, mentally and even physically. Boruto manages to center itself around the bods between the people of this time and the dynamics of these brand new characters meshing with the old. Without spoiling too much, it is safe to say that Boruto takes on all the better part of Naruto&#039;s quest for overcoming hardship by means of companionship and extends the theme to family, the future and the difficulty of love. <br />
<br />
The only reason character gets an 8/10 is because Boruto could have done more to explore the development of characters outside of the Boruto-Naruto dynamic. We know nothing of Narutos relationship with Hinata, Sakura or even any old members from his class. We also know very little about the younger generation and their dynamics. There are a lot of cameo appearances but they could have been explored even a little bit more forward. <br />
<br />
Overall, Boruto was a massively entertaining experience from the themes of family, love and hardship to the epic action packed combat. Boruto definitely does not fall short of any expectations and though not a good conclusion for the franchise (leaves many loose ends) it leaves one with the feeling of content and nostalgia all leaving lasting memories in the minds of the fans from those who have waited years watching Naruto grow, to those who picked it up recently and enjoyed the world of the shinobi. <br />
<br />
Thank you Kishimoto.

    The best word to descirbe Boruto is only; disappointing.<br />
The story cut short and its nothing different than the original old Naruto anime but there is one thing that really, really makes me mad.<br />
Boruto call Naruto &#039;dad&#039; but suddenly Naruto got mad, and want Boruto to call him Seventh in the Hokage office like what the f*ck! that just  really cruel. Where&#039;s Naruto that we know and love, is he change to be an asshole to his OWN family after become a Hokage?<br />
The story only base on a &#039;daddy issues&#039; that Boruto had with his so called father. But thank god Sasuke took a part

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229902">
        in this movie unlike Naruto: The Last which Sasuke only show up ONCE and literally said only 1 sentence after that he&#039;s gone.<br />
<br />
But in Boruto the movie Sasuke took a big part and become Boruto&#039;s teacher, and this is also another disappointing if you look at the trailer of this movie Boruto held a Chidori on his hands but in fact its nothing than a ninja tool that Boruto secretly use. Now that just burn everyone wishes that Sasuke teach him the Chidori jutsu.<br />
<br />
The art style is not so bad but it&#039;s pretty standard for anime movies. Hinata, Sakura and other grow-up women in this movie is actually gorgeous.<br />
<br />
[SPOLIERS]<br />
One thing I enjoy about Boruto is that I get to know who the hell is Mitsuki father or.... mother?<br />
<br />
The OST is played by KANA-BOON who also make a OP for Naruto Shipudden 16. <br />
<br />
Overall, this is the last Masashi Kishimoto creation but  it really can&#039;t be more disappointing. At least the OST is good right?

    I just got home from watching boruto the movie. Let me start off saying that this review will have spoilers! If you haven&#039;t read the manga nor naruto gaiden then I suggest to skip this review, therefore, you shall not pass from here.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
<br />
The story of this movie was very straightforward. Boruto doesn&#039;t like naruto and he became sasuke&#039;s apprentice to he can defeat his father. Kinshiki and Momoshiki are introduced as descendants of the Otsutsuki clan. Their objective is to reproduce what madara and kaguya did aka the big tree which contains all the chakra. They want that so they can gain immortality and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201135">
        youth. I&#039;ll talk about the characters in the character section.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10:<br />
<br />
The art was pretty good. I didn&#039;t notice a bad art like what you currently see in the anime.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
The soundtracks that were used on this movie were good, nothing special but still good.<br />
<br />
Character: 8:10<br />
<br />
The movie started off with sasuke fighting against Kinshiki and Momoshiki, who are descendant of the Ōtsutsuki clan. It started off with a lot of ninjutsu and taijutsu. The scenes were well done.<br />
<br />
Konohamaru introduced us a new tool that allows the user to seal techniques, which later on can be released from the small scroll and use the sealed technique.<br />
<br />
Boruto, he started off as your typical spoiled brat. He&#039;s the leader of his group conformed by sarada and mitsuki. Throughout the movie, he wanted his dad(naruto) to give him attention in every way possible. He doesn&#039;t want to become hokage.<br />
<br />
Sarada and Mitsuki convinced boruto to join the chunnin exams to prove how strong boruto is to his father. Naruto&#039;s duty is to watch the third round along with the other kages (Gaara, Chojuro, Darui and last but not least Kurotsuchi). <br />
<br />
Boruto did pretty well in the early stages by cheating using the device that Katasuke made (he did it for research purposes). In the last round, he had to fight Shikadai (the son of Shikamaru). Shikadai trapped naruto with the nara technique clan so boruto, he wanted to impress his dad, cheated there as well and naruto noticed it. Boruto, with the help of the device, makes a lot of clones that made shikadai forfeit. Boruto is later congratulated by everyone who was watching but naruto, who saw him cheating, told Shikamaru that boruto is disqualified for cheating. Boruto gets pissed off and told him that he is never there for him. And if it was there for him, he wouldn&#039;t have relied on the device.<br />
<br />
Kinshiki and Momoshiki appeared out of nowhere and then they start fighting (sasuke shows up). The other kages started evacuating the people who were watching the chunnin exams (they had no action at that part). The fight was dope though. Naruto, to save his son, took a direct attack (he was using a form bijuu mode with the sage chakra) and then somehow was captured by Momoshiki.<br />
<br />
Boruto believes that naruto died so he start thinking all the bad things that he told his dad. He goes into the hokage house and grabs his old outfit (naruto part 1) and start thinking about naruto. Sasuke shows up and told him that &#039;&#039;you&#039;re a bigger loser than your dad&#039;&#039; and tells him that naruto is still alive. He cries for happiness and uses naruto&#039;s outfit and goes to rescue his dad. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s shown to us that Momoshiki has been stealing naruto&#039;s chakra for a while and that he still have a huge amount of it. The gokages shows up along with sasuke and boruto and saves the day. Then the gokage starts fighting against Kinshiki. They are strong as hell! They live up for the title! Kages are OP! Somehow they were able to seal Kinshiki, in the same way that rsm naruto sealed one of madara&#039;s limbo with the truth seeking ball. <br />
<br />
Momoshiki fights against naruto and sasuke. He is outlasted very easy so he absorbs Kinshiki and becomes stronger. They keep fighting for a while. Naruto and Sasuke made a susanoo bijuu mode and then they ended defeating kinshiki. Then he goes into this lava golem version and start attacking our ninjas! Sasuke protects boruto and he request to make a rasengan. He tries to make a rasengan and then he throws it at Kinshiki, he noticed it and he prepares himself to absorb the attack but before the rasengan landed, it disappeared then he focused on naruto, the rasengan landed a hit on him. He ask why and that&#039;s because boruto&#039;s rasengan is a special case. His rasengan disappear and then appear (pretty cool!). Boruto goes to naruto and he helps his son to make a big rasengan (like the one that minato and naruto did in naruto shippuden lost tower). Boruto goes against Kinshiki and ends winning the battle.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
<br />
The movie was well done in my opinion. It was pretty good to see other naruto fans enjoy this movie. The soundtracks were on point. The art was good. The story was pretty good. <br />
<br />
I started hating boruto since the naruto gaiden but this movie makes you like him. He goes from spoiled brat to a badass boruto.<br />
<br />
The movie ended boruto respecting naruto and wants him to keep working as hard as possible as a hokage. He later meets up with sarada and mitsuki and then sarada asks him if he still wants to become a hokage. He told her not and that his dream is to support sarada&#039;s dream, which is to become hokage, and that he wants to be her right man (the shippers went all crazy at the movies theater). Not gonna lie. I found that moment very funny because sarada blushes. Then they ask mitsuki who his parents are. Mitsuki told them that orochimaru is his dad and then they ask... is he the father or the mother? All the people in the movies theater started laughing, including myself. It was a pretty good ending!<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
<br />
This movie was pretty good. Better than the last and I highly recommend it to everyone who has read the manga and naruto gaiden. 8/10 in my book!<br />

    So if your here already you should already know who Boruto is, any spoilers i say.  Everything mentioned happens in the first 5 minutes anyways.<br />
<br />
So Boruto has to be the biggest disappointment ive ever come across.  And im a huge psycho-pass fan.  So let me get this straight. So for over a decade, 600 episodes with god knows how many flashbacks, of Naruto having this childhood of loneliness and no one paying attention to him and not having parents or friends, acting out to get attention. This TORTURED childhood of PAIN which allows him to reach anyones heart, and hes a shit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203488">
        father?  Thats how this total hypocrisy of whats been shoved down our throats starts off?  Naurtos becomes an asshole who neglects his kids to the point they hate him?  He puts his own family thru the exact same thing that fucked him up sooooo bad as a kid?  That goes against everything Naruto is and has stood for these past 13 years. And apparently he needs anti-depressants.<br />
<br />
So with that out of the way whats next? Art? Exactly what youve seen already.  Music? Exactly the same. Characters? Sure its nice to see what becomes of everyone but its just Blah. So i guess Hinata is what? She pretty much did nothing the whole movie but call out to some people. This movie for real just brings down the whole series. <br />
<br />
So i guess theres a few action sequences.  Naruto doesnt use ninjutsu so dont expect to be impressed by anything Naruto does the whole movie apparently.  Sasuke being the only saving grace.  <br />
<br />
So to wrap it all up i wish i could say just skip this garbage, it truly puts a bad taste in your mouth, but we know that isnt gonna happen cause we are huge fans and have to see whats out there.  If you walk in already disappointed maybe it stings less.

    The movie is so awful,  I literally wish I could forget I ever saw it. I really loved Naruto and I was extremely sad it ended but there&#039;s no reason to drag the series any longer. If you love Naruto as a character, I suggest you to forget all about Boruto . The story is stupid and the newly introduced characters are badly drawn, uninspired, with no interesting character traits. I found the kids annoying and superficial considering they are training to be future warriors. Αnd all this hype around Boruto, regarding the alleged Naruto&#039;s death, is a cheap commercial trick.<br />
<br />
WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Well, Naruto

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247654">
        is a complete asshole in this movie. They had a great character, who was easy-going, pleasant, friendly, loved everyone and made people all around the shinobi world instantly like him and they completely changed his character into a boring, bossy, always serious and obnoxious person. This Naruto almost never laughs and always disappoints his family, having lost sight of what is important to him. It&#039;s like a badly written fan fiction novel, by someone who really hates the main character. I refuse to aknowledge this fake Naruto.  <br />
<br />
Naruto demands his son call him &quot;Seventh&quot; or &quot;Hokage&quot; instead of dad in his office. Are they kidding us? He called everyone &quot;jiichan&quot; or &quot;baachan&quot; and was always disrespectful, and now he demands his child to be this formal with his own father? He, who never cared about rules, and put above everything bonds between people would even think of saying something like that? <br />
<br />
Naruto seems to always neglect his family, being all day in his office and using his shadow clones to cover for himself. Boruto implies his father doesn&#039;t even remember his daughter&#039;s birthday and then we actually watch Naruto not going to the birthday party! He sent a clone which disappeared while holding the birthday cake. So, the birthday cake fell on the floor, the party was ruined, and everyone was sad, but Naruto didn&#039;t even bother say he was sorry, or try to make up for it. Are they really trying to persuade us, that Naruto, a person who grew up alone and always wished for a family, would ever treat his family like that? He, who spend so much time with other kids, like Konohamaru, would neglect his own children, to the point that they hate him?<br />
<br />
Naruto doesn&#039;t even bother congratulating his son for passing the first round of &quot;chuunin exams&quot;. Instead he sends a text message. In the second round it gets even worse as he discovers Boruto is using a machine to cheat, so he ridicules his son in front of everyone, disqualifies him, and then goes as far as taking his son&#039;s Konoha band saying he doesn&#039;t deserve to be a shinobi(!!!!). Well, I don&#039;t know who this horrible person is, but it definitely isn&#039;t the Naruto we all know.<br />
<br />
There are many more scenes like these. In general, they just wanted to make Boruto likeable, and the only thing they managed to think in order to make us pity the child, was to destroy everything we knew about the previous protagonist. If it was a random movie, regarding the strained relationship between a father and his son, it could be decent. But that is not the case here.

    After my blistering critique of the &quot;Last&quot; movie (in which I gave it a 1/10), people have asked me to review Boruto: Naruto the Movie. Here&#039;s all you need to know.<br />
<br />
The Good: <br />
- Definitely better than the &quot;Last&quot; movie.<br />
- The plot actually advances. Several characters undergo plot-altering changes, including the death of an important character in one of the opening scenes (that no one seems to care about).  The point is, this is not like in Last where everything just returns to normal and nothing new is revealed. The writers were given the power to forever alter the lives of the characters in a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207029">
        meaningful (non-shallow) way, which is essential for the story to have any tension or depth.<br />
- The relationship between unlikely star Sasuke and Boruto is one of the best sensei-pupil interactions since Kakashi and Team 7 and has surprising depth and symbolism. <br />
- The Boruto character is not necessary likeable, but he&#039;s realistically depicted, given his circumstances. The writers shied away from making him just another Naruto clone (pun intended) and gave him a completely different personality, but you&#039;re still able to see the resemblence beyond just his looks. (Boruto&#039;s also not as OP as Naruto was, which is a good thing) I&#039;m sure this was a very tough and mature decision for the writers and Kishimoto to make, as it would have been much easier to just repeat some of Naruto&#039;s old storylines (not that they didn&#039;t) and milk this cash cow for what it is.<br />
- Sasuke and Naruto (aka Batman &amp; Superman) team up Avengers style in some much improved battle scenes, which was what they should have done in the Last movie. The increased role of Sasuke meant that the artists could implement some very cool-looking taijutsu choreography that was missing from the Last movie (which closer resembed a rave light show than a ninja fight).<br />
- Regardless of whether you like him or hate him, Sasuke is easily the MVP of the entire Naruto franchise. He&#039;s the most interesting character, with the most interesting background, appearance, choreography, jutsus, and has some of the best lines in the series. No matter how big Naruto&#039;s Rasengan gets or what random animal shape it takes on, he really can&#039;t compare to Sasuke in terms of sheer appeal, even Boruto would agree. Of course, because of his often questionable and inconsistent personality, many fans hate his guts, myself included. But for the sake of this stand-alone movie, he is the unquestioned star. So if you like him, you&#039;ll find the movie enjoyable. If you hate him, then you won&#039;t.  <br />
- This is a Naruto movie. This is a show that many of us grew up watching, and have a very deep connection to. It may have even been one of the first animes you&#039;ve ever watched. So given the sheer scope of the universe in which it is set, it really doesn&#039;t need to be amazing for it to be enjoyable. This movie was decent. Considering how bad all the other movies have been, this was easily a success. I would go as far as to say it&#039;s the best Naruto movie, but that&#039;s like saying Alec Baldwin is the best Baldwin (I mean, they all pretty much suck).<br />
<br />
The Bad:<br />
- The movie moves at a snails pace.<br />
- It also tries to cover too much ground, both in terms of plot development and overarching themes. It succeeds at some, and fails at others.<br />
- Emotional depth is between shallow and non-existent. <br />
- Boruto, the titular character, in terms of storyline, is completely unnecessary to the movie, and really prevents the film from drawing you into their world. For example, in the final scene of the boss battle, Naruto and Sasuke seemed more preocupied with teaching Boruto a lesson than defeating the mass-murdering demi-god. This really takes away from the story&#039;s immersion.<br />
- Because the movie is stretched so thin, several interesting characters are given little to no screen time, including - Sarata, the other kid in team Boruto (who reminds me of Sai), and Naruto&#039;s daughter are all high-potential characters that got no love in the movie. Naruto&#039;s daughter literally got no love from Naruto in the entire movie, as Boruto is clearly his favorite child (makes sense, since Boruto reminds him of Sasuke, and his manlove for Sasuke is pretty epic).<br />
- The antagonist is very poorly written and his motivations are often confusing and nonsensical. He&#039;s esseentially just a &quot;bad guy who wants to do something bad.&quot; This is the result of the producers trying to do too much in one film. There was too much fat in this movie, a lot of which could have been trimmed down to depict a less meaningless antagonist. This is probably the movies greatest weakness.<br />
- The producers still have grammar issues. -_-;<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 4<br />
Art: 8<br />
Sound: 6<br />
Character: 7<br />
Enjoyment: 8 (10 if you&#039;re a Sasuke fanboy/fangirl)<br />
Overall: 7<br />
<br />
All in all, this movie is the frontrunner for: &quot;Anime you would shamefully watch twice, then pretend to all your friends you never saw it.&quot;

    I have watched this movie already 4 TIMES and just recently got around to reading the novelization. To me, this movie is perfect. A MASTERPIECE. 11/10.<br />

Story 10/10<br />
Art 10/10<br />
Sound 10/10<br />

Enjoyment 10/10<br />
Overall 10/10<br />
<br />
Naruto came into my life when I was around 9 or 10 years old. I&#039;m 20 now. So it goes without saying that I have a huge emotional connection to this series and everything that relates to it.<br />
<br />
I wish I knew how to write objective reviews but for this movie I couldn&#039;t do that even if I could. So let me tell you this instead: if you&#039;re like me and you&#039;ve literally grown up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229026">
        with Naruto and know the characters like they&#039;re your best friends, you will enjoy the shit out of this movie. Pardon my language.<br />
<br />
Words alone aren&#039;t even enough to describe how happy I am that this movie even exists in the first place. This is the perfect final chapter to the Naruto saga and the beginning to the story of Boruto. It&#039;s just incredible. 12/10.<br />
<br />
I laughed, I cried, I jumped in my seat and did a series of awkward fist-pumps (while looking over my shoulder to make sure no one saw) and I did that 4 TIMES. You know, there aren&#039;t very many movies out there that I&#039;ve watched this many times! And definitely not in such a short span of time. I feel like I could keep watching this movie everyday and not get tired of it. It&#039;s perfection all the way from animation to the soundtrack.<br />
<br />
11/10. MASTERPIECE. If you love Naruto, you will love this movie. It is incredible.

    For something that can use the Naruto name to basically make people watch anything, The Boruto Movie wasn&#039;t all that bad. Though that being said, this movie did everything you would expect to see in a Naruto movie, or rather have already seen in Naruto.... seen far too many times. To put it simply it was unbearably cliche. <br />
<br />
Before I continue, let&#039;s talk about target audience. I hardly doubt that anyone who hasn&#039;t read the Naruto manga to it&#039;s fullest will be going out of their way to watch this movie that is indeed set after the events that occur in Chapter 700 and even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207140">
        after the Naruto Gaiden. <br />
<br />
So obviously, the only people that are going to be watching this movie are going to be people who have invested a great deal of time with the Naruto franchise. Which is something this movie definitely made a note of. It showed tons of cameos from almost the whole main cast of Naruto doing something completely obscure. Just to have people start fanboying when their favourite character appears on screen. With that and having Naruto&#039;s name in the title of the movie, the movie could&#039;ve been some romance between Kiba and Ichiraku&#039;s daughter for 95 minutes and the studio would still make profit. <br />
<br />
So needless to say, I went into this movie with very low expectation, but during my watch, there were times where I was actually enjoying it. <br />
<br />
Story (4/10):<br />
The story is so freaking cliche it make me want to cry. Boruto, is having family troubles, Naruto gives a sort of pep talk and they&#039;re friends now, Boruto messes up, they break up, final fight happens, and they&#039;re back to being friends. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s the main story. It was boring, I hated everything about it. But there were certain premises in the movie&#039;s setting that I sort of liked. <br />
<br />
This is going to get a bit spoily, so read at your own risk.<br />
<br />
The scientific ninja tools that they had were one of the really cool things this movie introduced. Being someone who has been following Naruto for a long time, it mind boggled me how much these new ninja tools changed the power system in Naruto. It was like, everyone had their own pair of sharingan. Everyone was the Copy Ninja. But for some reason the movie shunned on it, which was a big let down. <br />
<br />
Also, the bad guys. They could have been really interesting, actually they were interesting, but we hardly got any of them. They came, they rekt, and then in the next 15 minutes proceeded to get rekt, and that was the end of that. They were somehow related to Kaguya and Kaguya&#039;s plan of creating the White Zetsu army, which was hardly explained. Leaving out the motives of the antagonist like that = bad, bad writing. <br />
<br />
Characters (4/10):<br />
The main character of this movie were, Boruto, Naruto, &amp; Sasuke. Naruto and Sasuke went through absolutely no character development... sort of.<br />
In Naruto&#039;s case, in the beginning of the movie he turn in to a douche bag, but then by the end of it he was back to being the same old Naruto, it&#039;s like reverse character development. <br />
<br />
Sasuke didn&#039;t change at all. <br />
<br />
Boruto sort of had character development, since by the end of the movie he stopped being a idiotic prick, but since he was a prick the whole movie you can&#039;t really like him, which turns into not caring about him. <br />
<br />
The supporting characters were pretty much the entire cast of the Naruto manga with their kids. <br />
Sarada has changed. She was a lot better off in the gaiden, she had the good components of both Sasuke and Sakura. Now she has just turned into a  less dramatic Sakura. She isn&#039;t a prick though, like both of her parents were. <br />
Her trying to be Hokage is cool, but that&#039;s from the Gaiden, and the movie really just adapted it.<br />
<br />
Mitsuki, was the sarcastic asshole. Which is totally awesome because you don&#039;t get that in Naruto. But he had almost little to none screen time. <br />
The other kids were the same, they made small appearances to show that they exist. <br />
Though I must say that the kid using the bugs (not confirmed to be Shino&#039;s son), has a badass character design. <br />
<br />
The other characters from the original Naruto manga, made small cameo appearances, but weren&#039;t all that important. Shikamaru &amp; Hinata were the only one&#039;s who actually tried to do something against the villains, of which Hinata&#039;s attempt was off-screen... something I don&#039;t I&#039;ll ever understand the reasoning behind. <br />
<br />
Oh... and then there were the Kage&#039;s. I hate them. I mean like why do we need to care about these guys, apart from Gaara, they are all fodder. I wanted to see Lee fight some bad guys not freaking Chojuro. Who the fk cares about Chojuro? <br />
Anyway, yeah the Kage were there, and they were somewhat important. <br />
<br />
The bad guys were really bad. Not as in evil, as in just bad. There purpose was glossed over and they weren&#039;t all that strong either. Just the fact that they had to use only taijutsu against them, (AND THEY STILL DIDN&quot;T BRING ROCK LEE FOR THE FINAL FIGHT). <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8/10): <br />
I did somewhat enjoy this movie, despite its many faults. <br />
One of the reasons was because of the high production value. <br />
<br />
The animation was absolutely brilliant and fluid, something Naruto is usually not so good at. The action scenes were some of the best I have ever seen in anime, and definitely the best Naruto has ever offered. <br />
<br />
As a long running Naruto fan, I did enjoy seeing the character as adults, though I did feel that some of them didn&#039;t change much. <br />
<br />
Overall (6/10);<br />
The movie was pretty bad from a critical standpoint, in fact it was terrible. But considering its target audience and how bad it really could have been (see Naruto: The Last for an example), it did  a somewhat mediocre job. And hence should get a mediocre score.

    Some major nostalgia moments<br />
Fight choreography was amazing (to be expected)<br />
<br />
Lots of recycled material but wasn&#039;t that bad; could have been way worse.<br />
Hate the way they designed naruto&#039;s personality, they exaggerated his features too much.<br />
Sasuke was pretty cool, but they made him very 2 dimensional and NOTHING like how he used to be.<br />
<br />
Story turned out better than i expected; the synopsis made me hate boruto&#039;s character before i even watched it. I&#039;m glad he wasn&#039;t overly bratty and resentful.<br />
<br />
Very nice seeing all the old characters showcasing some moves here and there.<br />
<br />
Overall, WAY better than the last: naruto the movie. the last is a 3/10<br />

    Complete evolution?<br />
<br />
I believe the big challenge for anime writers after a successful run of their work is when to  stop. Questions like what are their target group, and when would these fans stop believing in their ideas should dominate their thoughts. And for the kingpins of anime series such as onepiece,  Detective Conan, Pokemon, Gintama etc, due to their loyal fan base, plot nature or no-plot nature they don&#039;t even consider it. Well Pokemon simply targets a younger age group and do not mature their theme as this group grows. Onepiece tries to mature its theme (time skip) but Luffy and the gang

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207289">
        still feel the same ever. But with Naruto, they&#039;ve been more successful(shippuuden) among the Kingpins... and trust me, I know loads of grown ups who still have a thing with naruto.  But unless you&#039;ve been living under a rock, naruto has ended (Manga) so the question is what is this movie about Boruto trying to archive...<br />
<br />
Character (old generation)<br />
Well I intentionally skipped my comments on the story because there was very little there (heck I&#039;ve even forgotten what the villain wanted). But the story was largely dependent on the characters in the movie. Of course  we get to see an all grown up Naruto whose development was spot on. Kudos to Kishimato for a real depiction. I don&#039;t get why people are crying that he was depicted as too cold. Yes he couldn&#039;t express his true feelings to his son and he was so immersed in work as Hokage that he didn&#039;t get enough time to spend with his family but c&#039;mon guys what did you expect. Naruto was always emotionally daft and he&#039;s been practically singing &quot;I going to be Hokage!&quot; Since forever. In fact if Kishimato depicted any other version of a man Naruto it wouldn&#039;t be true to the story. <br />
Sasuke was also all mysterious and super cool as he&#039;s always been. But I could sense more maturity in his relationship with people especially with his wife and daughter and surprisingly with Boruto. I really love the developments on Sasuke and how the whole Naruto-Sasuke friendship has blossomed. There were quite a number of fight scenes featuring their teamwork which were awesome and nostalgic. <br />
Well the other matured characters were got given enough screen time but they were quite consistent anytime they reappeared. <br />
<br />
Characters (new generation)<br />
Boruto: Ok I know what&#039;s on everyone&#039;s mind... Does he bring anything fresh to the table? Well I&#039;ll say let&#039;s wait and see but so far not bad. He does have some uniqueness but yet still resembles little Naruto and that&#039;s the beauty of it. But c&#039;mon Kishimato! You could do more with his techniques. I don&#039;t want to spoil too much tho.<br />
Sarada: She definitely feels more unique than Boruto and I definitely have high hopes for her. <br />
The rest of the next gen cast were very well introduced and would definitely leave you hungry for more.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
I think the art was well done but not the best. The fight scenes were smooth but was lacking in details<br />
<br />
Overall /enjoyment<br />
I really enjoyed the movie, if you are a true fan of Naruto you should . This movie does an excellent job pulling down the curtain on the old Gen and throwing the spotlight on the new. The Naruto series is a perfect testament  on how a long standing series could evolve with its fanbase through the years, reward them with a complete ending for their loyalty and then finally offer them hope for their kids to also start a new journey on their own. A complete transitioning! <br />

    This movie sums up the legacy of Naruto very well! I enjoy watching it from the first till the very last minute plus credits and the cliffhanger of Mitsuki&#039;s parent after that. Everyone was laughing on that!<br />
<br />
The plot and scenes are arranged beautifully that I feel no time is wasted. Graphics animations and music soundtrack also have amazing effects!<br />
<br />
Even if you don&#039;t read the Japanese manga or previous movie, you can tell that the essence of story about a boy who&#039;s longing for a father&#039;s acceptance but ended up overwhelmed by the fact that Boruto&#039;s father (Naruto) has overcame so much weaknesses that viewers should

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212605">
        know how did he do that. On the sideline, we also see how Naruto&#039;s best friends like Sasuke, Shikamaru and the Gokages teaming up in ways we&#039;ve never seen before as the new united generation. The scenes where Naruto and Sasuke fighting Kinshiki are awesome, beat my expectation!<br />
<br />
Movie is about 90% close to the novel which is excellent. Some scenes like Sakura &amp; Temari, Chunnin Exams, flashback on Naruto learning Rasengan with Jiraiya, Neji&#039;s death really brings fond of memories of Naruto stories.<br />
<br />
The movie could&#039;ve been a little better with deeper interaction between Naruto, Hinata and Himawari, as well as Konohamaru and Kakashi. I hope this is not the last from either Naruto or Boruto.

     After introducing us Boruto in Naruto: Gaiden and The Last: Naruto the Movie, Masashi Kishimoto decided to make one more movie about the new generation in The Hidden Lead Village. A short review, on Boruto: Naruto the Movie.<br />
<br />
Since it is just a movie, I&#039;ll skip my usual review sections and just talk about it freely. But first of all, SPOILER ALERT (If you haven&#039;t read the Naruto manga til the end)!<br />
<br />
Naruto, finally grown up, finally the HOKAGE. His dream, and our dream I think finally came true but it is not that easy, even for the hero of the village. Even tough he is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208235">
        Konoha&#039;s hero, he is also has to be the hero of little Himawari and Boruto, his children. In the middle of the story, the older son Boruto, who is not a great fan of his father being the Hokage. He is working all the time, and he doesn&#039;t have much time for his family. Boruto feeling frustrated wants nothing else but his father&#039;s attention. Good that the jounin exams are on the way where Boruto finally wants to show his father how strong he is.<br />
<br />
Reason I loved this movie? The feels come back. All the time spent with Naruto, crying, cheering, hoping...Everything is back, just with a lot new young faces being at the same level Naruto was in the beginning. It really puts a smile on my face seeing Sakura again, Sasuke, Hinata, Shikamaru, the whole crew. And what&#039;s more important, their children. I can&#039;t describe the feeling I had watching it again. And I have to admit, it even made me cry at one point.<br />
The story of the movie is emotional on one side, and action-loaded on the other. You get the best of Naruto in 1h and 35min, approximately.<br />
<br />
When the movie started (in Eng SUB), I was 100% sure that something wasn&#039;t right. Not the animation, it was great, and sure a bit different. (Ah, how the time passes). It were not the characters, they were also cool. And than it came to my mind. It was not in Japanese. Background info: The Japanese DUB version could only have been seen in Cinemas in Japan, but the Koreans made their own DUB and it somehow leaked into public. Soon English subtitles were made and now the whole internet is full of a Naruto movie with Korean DUB and English SUB. Still, it is watchable, can&#039;t deny that one. But it sure is strange as hell.<br />
<br />
So if you don&#039;t mind hearing a bit Korean instead of Japanese, go and enjoy the Eleventh Naruto Movie: Boruto! I am sure you will love it.

    I already wasted like 2 hours of my life on this shit movie so why not spend another 10 minutes berating it. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start off by saying I&#039;ve loved Naruto since I was a kid, and I&#039;ve always been more partial to it over other shounen that I&#039;ve watched as a kid because of that nostalgia. I love the original and even Shippuden with all it&#039;s flaws could still keep my interest to the end. That&#039;s the keyword, &quot;end.&quot; Sadly, Boruto manages to rear his ugly head in like an outro at the end of movie credits that makes you say, &quot;wait there&#039;s more?&quot; <br />
<br />
This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review288594">
        movie is so soulless and boring that it managed to surpass my already low-expectations going into it. It&#039;s the movie equivalent of 2 month old expired milk. It tasted really good once upon a time so you thought it&#039;d be okay to pull out again and pour onto your cereal only for you to get moldy, poorly aged chunks of garbage. <br />
<br />
Why are all the characters so dead? Everyone became indifferent pencil pushers that dislike being alive. 95% of the personality from the original cast just died and went into their kids. And even their kids are still all unlikable and try way too hard to be their dad/mom or to be as edgy as possible. The entire movie is just &quot;how long will everyone be lifeless husks that ignore Boruto until he&#039;s pissed and fucks something up.&quot; I was hoping the villain would redeem the movie at least a little bit but no, he somehow made it worse with how nonsensical his motives and appearance was. I guess the art and sound is okay? But I don&#039;t think it can really excuse all of the garbage I had to sit through nor did it make the experience any better.<br />
<br />
At this point I&#039;m convinced Madara wanted to complete the Infinite Tsukuyomi to prevent Boruto from happening. This movie is real bad.

    After Naruto the Last and Naruto Gaiden I had very low expectations for the movie but I was pleasantly surpised.<br />
<br />
The plot is nothing special, it&#039;s centers on father-son relationship. but it was well done, it had emotion but it wasn&#039;t cheesy like in the last movie. Bonus point for ninja tool device.<br />
<br />
The best part was the characters. I thought Boruto was a mini Naruto clone but I was wrong. He is insolent just like Naruto was, but he is also his own persona.<br />
He doesn&#039;t want to be Hokage, he is talented but he isn&#039;t a super hardworking guy. He is  a priviledged kid but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208425">
        also a  sympathetic character. <br />
Naruto matured and kinda lost his dorkiness.The fact that he doesn&#039;t know how to be a father ùakes sense sinnce he didn&#039;t have a father or family for the matter to show him. Sasuke and Sakura were pretty good too. The villains were transparent but since the movie forcused on Naruto and his son I didn&#039;t mind.<br />
<br />
The action scenes felt too DBZ . I wish we would see Boruto and his teammate fight more in Chuunin Exam.

    Well, the art is really good, especially fighting scenes. The music is catchy too. However these things do not save the whole movie. <br />
<br />
To tell the truth, by the time I finished Naruto, I have been totally fed up with Kishimoto characters&#039; design, and plot and other stuffs. <br />
<br />
He keeps making the same mistakes. As a female, I&#039;m really disappointed to see Sarada - such a potential character, being pushed to the background by a lame &quot;father issue&quot; character. Naruto and Sasuke play major roles while their wives are still useless as usual. DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A BADASS FEMALE CHARACTER HERE?! <br />
<br />
Then again, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207581">
        story, at least it certainly is better than &quot;the Last&quot;. But, it moves slowly in the opening, then too rush in the final battle. And... I mean what&#039;s wrong with you people?! For the last 2 movies Naruto is a completely different person, a hypocrite that is. <br />
This is a new area and nothing new is going around, still the same faces, same issue fighting some psycho white fellows from time to time, almost makes me think that&#039;s a deja vu. I really think they should spend time on exploring the new era rather than displaying such an obnoxious brat and why he hates his hypocrite dad.<br />
<br />
 *I heard that Kishimoto is writing a new series about Boruto, well truly hope he would really move on and stop dragging Naruto&#039;s crew back.

    My review might be slightly biased because I am a huge Naruto fan, but I just got back from the cinema and am honestly completely ecstatic after watching this. <br />
<br />
WARNING: SOME SPOILERS AHEAD.<br />
<br />
The most impressive thing for me were the fight scenes. The animation was simply incredible, and the action (though I am embarrassed to say) was so thrilling that I actually ended up sweating. The soundtrack, as always, was fantastic. However, I will comment that Naruto and Boruto&#039;s voices were a bit too similar at times, and therefore the age difference didn&#039;t come through well.<br />
<br />
A pretty major let-down for me was the whole initial

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201633">
        conflict between father and son, since it&#039;s difficult to imagine that the hero and most emotionally feeling person in the story is neglecting his own son. But I can&#039;t deny that it made for a good story and resolution, not to mention character development.<br />
<br />
All in all, I simply can&#039;t reduce the score very much, and I am basing this also on my mother&#039;s opinion who had to watch it with me without ever seeing the show before. She wanted to rate it a 10/10 as well, so I can&#039;t argue with the boss.

    I grew up watching Naruto as a child and those moments were filled with admiration towards Naruto.In my eyes, he is one of the best hero. <br />
Naruto grew up facing hardships along the way but he never gives in and had become an Hokage he dreamed to be. Watching Naruto has always motivate me in my life.Though i have grown up and realised this story is not as good as i thought of.Regardless of that, i watched it till the end to properly end this childhood story of mine.<br />
<br />
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER:<br />
<br />
Story:5<br />
Re-using the same plot since Akatsuki,targeting the Bijuu. The antagonist of this movie,(did not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202719">
        care to remember his name) wanted to absorb the chakra of the Bijuu to become the strongest being without training and that is the theme of this story.<br />
One have to work hard to achieve result without cheating.<br />
In this movie,it was shown that Konoha&#039;s head of technology department created a device that can make a simple commoner use advanced Ninjutsu without using any chakra.This device is quite dangerous when you think about it.With this,it might results into another war.Hence,i did not find the reasons why Naruto did not banned this project from beginning.He was shown to have knowledge of it so he ought to know.Anyway, Boruto learned the hard way why training is important.<br />
<br />
Art:7<br />
Compared to The Last,the animation is not up to par to it but still a good enough coming from Naruto.<br />
<br />
Sound:6<br />
Well it was okay i guess.<br />
<br />
Character:8<br />
Contrary to The Last,this movie showed a lot of the old casts which i am happy to see.Each one of them holds some role though a bit disheartened that Tsunade and Kakashi was not shown at all.Are they dead?Oh well, this movie featured Boruto from a cheating and spoiled child to a spitting image of Naruto i&#039;ve known.In a way,he have grown to be as stupid as Naruto is.Although,being stupid has its merits. It was shown as well that Naruto is a busy man,not giving attention to his children which is bad.Although i get where he is coming from.He, who lived alone wouldn&#039;t know how to bring up a child.He unconsciously treated them the way he grew up as,which is alone.Maybe he finds it awkward. Hokage is a busy man but he should spent some precious time with his family. At the end, the interactions between Naruto and Boruto improved a lot which im happy to see.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:9<br />
The fight scene were top-notched.A bit dissapointed with the other Kages besides Gaara.They need to shape up,seriously.Well the movie was filled with a lot of action and when watching in a cinema,actions are better.They were some teary moments and epic as well.In the end i enjoyed it greatly despites the poor story plot.<br />
<br />
Welp, im done.Can&#039;t believe i&#039;ve wrote so long for a first-time reviewer.Please do forgive my bad grammars and vocabulary.This is my view so you don&#039;t have to criticize the story base on it.Enjoy it to your best.<br />
