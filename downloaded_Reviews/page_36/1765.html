    Sugar Sugar Rune at the surface it seems like a typical run-of-the-mill magical girl series that follows the traditional formula dating back to its predecessors. It has magical transformation sequences, stylish magical wands, and crazy magical items that will make Doraemon proud. The presentation and aesthetics are glamorous. Certainly aim for little girls for its simplicity and amusing appeal. But exploring further down the line, Sugar Sugar Rune rather go a different approach in its theme that even teens and young adults will find it enthralling for its “Shoujo Romance Element” and character exploration that added uniqueness among its competition at the time.<br />
<br />
The title has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review360747">
        a rather unique premise and story mechanics that further enforces the shoujo romance that affects our character&#039;s motivation and behavior.<br />
<br />
To summarize the story it’s about the adventures of Chocola and Vanilla. They are queen candidate witches sent to the human world to collect heart crystals. Whoever acquires the most heart will become the next successor to the throne and rule the entire magical world. The premise looks simple enough to understand but once the actual heart crystal collecting takes place, this is where the show actually shines its bizarre style of romance. <br />
<br />
Sugar Sugar Rune&#039;s heart mechanics are more complex but easily digestible. They need to gather the heart crystal opposite sex by making them fall in love with them. Heart crystal varies in color depending on how deep the person has fallen in love with them.<br />
<br />
What interesting about heart capture mechanics is that it serves as the introduction of the shows world-building. From the perspective of Chocola and Vanilla will have basic knowledge between the interactions of the magical world and the human world. <br />
<br />
The Deus Ex Machina makes sense. We know they will keep collecting hearts from the individual humans so this kind of soft reset in the relationship of our heroines is quite essential for them. Though it may look like the show is working as an episodic guy of the week formula but there are always a consistent build-up and change of pace from time to time. Our heroines are learning new things on each new encounter and there always new things happening in the show that will keep the audience interest. <br />

When it comes to the story the 2 main heroines, Vanilla, and Chocolate style of interaction provided very interesting dynamics. Chocala and Vanilla&#039;s personality and behavior are completely polar opposite from each other. Chocola is brave, daring, stubborn, naive, and outgoing while Vanilla is shy, frail, wimpy, level-headed, and strategic. But even with the huge differences Chocola and Vanilla friendship is solid until the end of the series. Even if they are technically rivals, their relationship doesn&#039;t falter. <br />
<br />
In contrast in the magical girl series that has a lot of magical battles, Sugar Sugar Rune has less of it. Its magical battles are the show weak points for not being animation magic. Instead of focusing on making extravagant magical battles or transformation where the magical girl series are well known for. Sugar Sugar Rune is more like a “Slice of Life Isekai” where it’s about the daily lives of Chocola and Vanilla in the human world, where they learn the complexity of human emotions. Experiencing firsthand the sweet joy and bitter sadness of life that influence their motivations and character development while at the same time fleshing out some side characters among the way that makes each episode enjoyable. There is always a moral lesson to learn and feels a good moment in the show that made it a good slice of life.<br />
<br />
The character art style is a combination of vampiric goth design and sweet girlish fashion. This also extends to the Magical World Design of being a Halloween town and Candy Land at the same time which blends creatively well. For me, Sugar Sugar Rune aesthetic is quite unique and the updated anime design from the manga is an improvement.<br />
<br />
The OP and ED song has quite a charm for it and the soundtrack has some good moments and timing when it comes to the critical scene.  Overall everything in the sound and music department is good.<br />
<br />
And for added bonus, the magic incantation is not even random gibberish. If Sugar Sugar Rune doesn’t look European enough, it also sounds one for using a lot of French Word in its magic incantations. Like “Agrandissment” mean “expansion” in French. Expanding further consistently to the names of the character from the magical world like Meilleure, Chocola where “Meilleure” indicates expensive gourmet chocolate in French. And up to places in the magical world like Le Royaume means “Kingdom” in French. There is definitely a huge amount of research is dedicated to it.<br />
<br />
Exploring the World Building Further (Minor Spoiler in this Paragraph)<br />
<br />
Collecting hearts in the human world is pretty much essential for the magical world for it serves as currency. For example how the magical world economy work is that “Heart Crystals” value can range from “Crimson Heart” which means “Passionate Love” has the highest value amounting to 5000 ecure while a color “Pee Color Heart” is worth 5 ecure. This ecure value can be used as a commodity to purchase magical items in the shop. This item can further help chocola and vanilla in getting more hearts. These items can range from make-up kits that can make you prettier or up to special items that can make people attracted head over heels at you. This does make our girl&#039;s morality questionable for playing on other people&#039;s hearts. But in the magical world, this is just a daily job routine essential in the magical world. This also differentiates the magical world from the human world. The ecure currency also serves as a metric in measuring the 2 witch candidate’s progression.  <br />
<br />
Witches and wizards are forbidden to fall in love with humans. It will spell death or punishment for whoever defiles the rules. Wizards and witches have only one heart while humans can produce an unlimited amount which makes absolute sense. <br />
<br />
Exploring the Franchise Further (Contains some Major Spoiler) (Go to the “Final Thoughts” if you don’t want to get spoiled)<br />
<br />
Anime VS Manga<br />
<br />
I don’t usually talk about the source material of an anime unless it’s absolutely necessary if I feel the show is incomplete or the ending is unsatisfying but Sugar Sugar ending just makes me feel I want to know more. The anime has left me with a lot of unanswered questions that made me unsatisfied. After I finish reading the manga this where I discovered the anime has some technical flaws and essential differences. First off is that the manga dig more into details about technical stuff that the anime just summarize and skip which is to be fair it’s doesn’t affect the core narrative but you are surely going to skip a lot of interesting details. Another thing is the complete diverge of story direction, but there is a reason for this. The sugar sugar rune anime ended in 2006 while the manga ended in 2007. From the start to the middle the anime and manga share a similar story narrative with little technical changes but a major separation in the story was made midway. Meaning the anime ending is an anime original. To me, the manga has a superior story pacing and lore that make every loose piece of the puzzle connected. But even with some shortcomings that the anime has it still a good standalone show even if you don’t have any knowledge of the source material. It just the manga become an essential read after finishing the anime for it will fill up the void of unanswered questions.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts<br />
<br />
Sugar Sugar Rune nowadays is not for everybody because its art style, animation, and episode duration are not appealing to try out for modern audiences. But if you don’t mind the gothic cute art style and episode count while the same time looking for simple magical girl series without any too much elaborate magical battles. Sugar Sugar Rune is certainly a good magical girl series to try out. It has good humor, likable characters, an easily digestible story, and some good slice of life moments that is worth checking it out.  <br />
<br />
And if you still end up wanting more? I recommend reading the manga for the deep story lore.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#039;m gonna knock you out!&quot; if you don’t read the manga!

    Sugar Sugar Rune is my favorite Mahou Shoujo anime. Though I generally like the genre, and watch it a lot, I found this anime not only more enjoyable but also deeper then many other anime.<br />
<br />
At first I was just in love with the fact the two witches could see the hearts of humans, and I admit, I wish I could do the same. Although the story starts out simple, like they are just playing a game, the story gets deeper, and more serious around half the series. The story is about jealousy, friendship and love. And even though this is common for many mahou shoujo

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25927">
        series, I find the way it is portrayed in this anime great mainly because it isn&#039;t as you would expect. There are things you would expect when watching it, of course, but they are always twisted just a little bit from what I had imagined, and therefore still surprising.<br />
<br />
The art, well, I love it. It is beautifull and the animation is clean. I like the character designs, although I do not like all the clothes :P<br />
<br />
The sound is good, and although most of the voice actors aren&#039;t that popular, they did a great job. The only problem for me was Waffle, who kept reminding me of Honey-sempai.<br />
<br />
Characters:  I loved them. I never really liked Vanilla though, but all the other characters are fun and easy to relate to. I especially love Pierre, who is cold but still caring and who really helped me enjoy this series. Waffle was annoying sometimes, but certainly near the end of the series, she matured and I realised she wasn&#039;t so bad after all.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I greatly enjoyed this anime, I plan to buy the manga&#039;s and dvd box because I would love to see more of it. (I actually already bought a &#039;sugar sugar rune&#039;goodie bag when I was in Italy, but to my dissapointment it only had barbie stuff in it T-T) This series is number 2 in top 10 anime and I recommend it to everyone!

    I was very surprised by this series--it looked like a bunch of candy fluff in the beginning and though I thought it was still cute at first I didn&#039;t expect this addicted feeling to it that I now have. Like an addiction to chocolate--just can&#039;t get enough, and beneath the candy sweet there&#039;s a lot more bitterness and plot to it than I ever would have guessed. There&#039;s a lot about growing up, the feelings of love and friendship expressed in this series and it still carries a very innocent feel to it. If you are fond of series like Ultramaniac, Cardcaptor Sakura, and Gakuen

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9208">
        Alice you should really like this series. Though amazingly, I think Sugar Sugar Rune has more in romance and deeper plot though it doesn&#039;t really start surfacing until about midway through (you just get hints before). <br />
<br />
I really like the characters Chocolat and Vanilla and how they manage to be such close friends while still being rivals for the throne. Vanilla is sweet and shy--always kind and gentle though a little bit of a crybaby. This cute nature as well as her clutzy moments tends to endear her to the boys of the human world and she&#039;s a natural at gathering hearts. Chocolat on the other hand is brass and strong-willed and her favorite phrase is &amp;quot;I&#039;ll whoop your butt&amp;quot; which gains her much less popularity in the human realm than she enjoyed in the magic realm. Even as you wince at some of her antics and her nature, it&#039;s easy to root for her, especially as you see her maturing.<br />
<br />
Each heart has a different level of worth, the &amp;quot;pee&amp;quot; heart is usually just surprise, to orange, pink, and crimson (along with green for friendship, blue for respect, and the mysterious dark &amp;quot;Noir&amp;quot; heart for jealousy and greed). The system with the hearts is surprisingly detailed. A witch can&#039;t give her own heart to a human without being stuck forever in the human world, and if it is taken from a witch (more specifical an &amp;quot;ogre&amp;quot; or dark witch) than that witch&#039;s life is forfeit. Ups the stakes a little right? Especially when Chocolat starts falling for the mysterious upperclassman, Pierre who is much more than he seems and bears a startling resemblance to the Ice Prince from the magic realm&#039;s history. <br />
<br />
Pierre really made this series a joy for me. Even when there was only hints or slight scenes, I loved his interaction with Chocolat and fascinated by his character. As he got more involved into the plot... well, I just happier and happier. <br />
<br />
A good majority of the episodes are very episodic and cute, but you&#039;ll be pleasantly surprised when some deeper plot starts slipping in. If you can live through transformation scenes, and like a cute series with some fun characters, magic world, and some intrigue and romance on the side, give this series a try.

    Ahh...Sugar Sugar Rune is probably one of the best anime I have ever watched partly because it is such an enjoyable anime. <br />
<br />
I love ALL the characters especially Chocolat and not to mention, the ever so sexy Pierre with his sexy chants (Don&#039;t you think he sounds so omfg hot whenever he casts his magic spells?) I thought that the animation and artwork was OUTSTANDING. Seriously, in this anime, I noticed they use less chibi art and express more emotions in the characters faces and that&#039;s what I love about it. <br />
<br />
I LOVED how deep the story is and how Chocolat seems to think more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34351">
        than she acts - making me think that she&#039;s a really brave and mature girl who&#039;s not afraid to act what she thinks. <br />
<br />
The friendship between Chocolat and Vanilla is SO real that it sometimes brings tears to my eyes when I see them fighting. Sometimes, I really do envy their relationship - that&#039;s how REAL their friendship is.<br />
<br />
As for Pierre - he is my absolute favourite. I loved him. Why isn&#039;t there a guy like Pierre? Pierre&#039;s dark, deep and mysterious which explains why I love him.<br />
<br />
I like watching how his feelings for Chocolat grow - slowly...and eventually so strong that he&#039;s willing to....*watch the anime to get it* ^_^<br />
<br />
Even though these girls are just 10 year olds, they definitely do not act or think the way a 10 year old think. Makes me wonder why was I playing with Barbie when I was a 10 year old -_-<br />
<br />
The characters&#039; sound perfectly fitted the roles of the characters. I love it. The person who played Pierre had a very sexy and deep voice - exactly like how Pierre is.<br />
<br />
As for Chocolat - very cute and angry sounding :P As for Vanilla, KAWAII ne!<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s not forget the supporting characters, the familiars, Duke and Bianca - ONE WORD. FUNNY.<br />
<br />
I love how Duke goes kero and Bianca goes chu chu - it&#039;s so so cute! Waffle is a great addition to the story as well as she makes the whole story less serious and funny.<br />
<br />
Robin is wonderful as well. Cinnamon is very special looking and somewhat attracts me a lot.<br />
<br />
Although the anime is WAY different than the manga, I can honestly say that I would prefer the anime because of it&#039;s striking colour and fantastic animation. Although I&#039;d prefer people to read the manga to get the REAL story of the battle between the Ogres and the magical world. Very deep - in the manga, less deep in the anime. <br />
<br />
Overall, the storyline is good - I mean hell!! What a creative and original storyline if you ask me. The characters - are beautiful and different. Sigh. I just adore Pierre. Do excuse me. :3<br />
<br />
I&#039;d recommend EVERYBODY to watch it because I seriously tear up in most of the episodes. You HAVE got to love Chocolat. Love the way she thinks and how strong she is. Makes me admire her a lot.<br />
<br />
SUGAR SUGAR RUNE FTW!<br />
<br />

    Part 1 Chunk: (Please forgive me for basically writing an essay.  I need to find another hobby.)<br />
<br />
What show could fit your mood if you&#039;re looking for something simple yet fun? This show.  It is nothing more than a children&#039;s show, but it is far from being boring.  Sure, it can get rather repetitive, but the repetitive parts I found hard to outright hate, actually.  I do dislike a certain character who is purely there to create filler, but even she ends up better in the end.  If anything, this show stole my heart AND if you think stealing hearts is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review45749">
        a bad thing, this show will do it anyway with magic potions, love charms, hugs, smiles, and kisses.  <br />
<br />
Two Witches named Chocolat Meilleure and Vanilla Mieux are Queen Candidates who collect valuable different colored hearts can only receive them by wooing Human boys.  (&quot;Gotta catch &#039;em all! That is their master plan.&quot;)  <br />
<br />
Yes, Humans and Witches are two different species pretending to date, but Witches are not allowed to fall in love with Humans no matter what (i.e., their hearts are not allowed to turn Red).  Does it get really hard not to wish they could reciprocate a Humans&#039; feelings fully at times? Sure, but if anything that just makes Witches desire to understand and observe the ways in which love works like scientists more.  However, they aim to gather experience in the Human world so that they can learn the best from both worlds and apply that to their futures in Magical World politics or in whatever else they choose to do.  It&#039;s supposed to be a Win=Win situation, despite Witches not being able to fall in love with Humans, in general. <br />
<br />
The show, however, throws its biggest hurdle at the Queen Candidates with the introduction of a group called the Ogres.  Since Chocolat and Vanilla are fairly young and naive, they learn the hard way about how they already have enemies out to get them because of their royal status.  If the Witches are dedicated to pure love, the Ogres are dedicated to all that is evil and/or taboo, such as forbidden love, etc.; in other words, they are natural born enemies.  <br />
<br />
One particular character, who attends school with the Queen Candidates, is very interesting because he is supposed to be an Ogre, yet he is very innocent in appearance (I will not say who, but it should become fairly obvious early on).  He believes that if Witches and Ogres aren&#039;t supposed to love Humans, they are meant to be taken over.  So, if the girls represent the essence of pink, BOY, does he embrace the essence of the color black.  His presence is said to be full of &quot;Noir.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, while this show is very simple, the way everything is set up the characters are going to have to grow A LOT (especially Vanilla who is a shy, frail, polite, bundle of nerves; as opposed to Chocolat who is brave, stubborn, and outgoing but has poor manners).  <br />
<br />
In fact, the ending is a fantastic example of how having the will power to do what is right can transcend most if not all of the conflict, confusion, and uncertainty thrown their way.  As predictable as the outcome may be, it is never boring to watch it when it feels like a theater play whose leads try to perform with their heads held high and their hearts gleaming (very pretty, shiny hearts).<br />
<br />
Part 2 Chunk:<br />
<br />
Sugar Sugar Rune has a very European flavor with lots of eccentricity added to it and some goth touches, so no setting could possibly fit it better like a glove! The Magical World, however, looks like Halloween Town and Candy Land put together! <br />
<br />
It&#039;s important to mention the food, too, after mentioning Candy Land, right? Well, it&#039;s completely Western/European, very appetizing, and, also, consists of tons of desserts and candy! <br />
<br />
A fun quirk is that many things are given a French name.  Although, the French is really simple and is nothing like the lengthier phrases used in, say Maria-sama ga Miteru, for example.  Some of the spells Chocolat uses, for instance, are &quot;La Fleur Spirale,&quot; &quot;La Étoile Brilliant,&quot; &quot;Agrandizement,&quot; etc.  <br />
<br />
This show, also, loves bubble baths, fragrances, pearls, jewels, charms, stars, the Moon, or any kind of mysticism that Witches might love.  Creativity is certainly not something this show lacks, nor foreign, exotic, or paradise scenery!<br />
<br />
Aside from everything else, I could draw a good amount of similarities between Sugar Sugar Rune and Harry Potter, such as a flying car, flying broomsticks, Mandrake, dragons, big spiders, unicorns, an invisibility cloaking object, etc.  <br />
<br />
The art in the show is quite good.  Although, I think it could&#039;ve been done better, especially if you compare some of it to Moyoco Anno&#039;s gorgeous art in the manga.  The animation varies from average to very neat and exciting, such as the Witches falling from the sky in the 1st episode, and the ending of the 4th episode is wow! Pretty is all I can say.  The animation in the 37th episode, and plenty of other episodes is surprisingly top notch, also.  <br />
<br />
The music in the show is quite memorable, in fact, some of the songs are playing in my head right now.  The best song is, of course, the opening! It is a song that pays homage to &quot;Poupée de Cire, Poupée de Son&quot; by France Gall and is probably one of the most fun songs I&#039;ve heard as an anime OP as of yet (except for Azumanga Daioh&#039;s OP, maybe?).  I think I&#039;ve watched the opening 100 times already, but the two ending songs are really pleasant, too!<br />
<br />
Who has the best seiyuu? Honestly, I cannot choose, since all of them did a fantastic job and sound very cute saying little phrases in French.<br />
  <br />
Robin - His seiyuu has an incredibly silky smooth voice, and he sings great! (Listen to Robin&#039;s seiyuu sing &quot;SUPERSTAR&quot; and &quot;DON&#039;T CRY.&quot;)  <br />
Chocolat - Her seiyuu gets some of the best lines.  Even though everybody in this show seems to have a catchphrase, hers are the best.  <br />
Vanilla - Her seiyuu is fitting and sounds like she&#039;s going to cry all the time; although, it could get on some peoples&#039; nerves a little bit.  <br />
Duke and Blanca - They&#039;re opposites, and they fight and argue a lot so that&#039;s done very well.  <br />
Saule and Houx - They sound like teenagers for sure, but they are very unusual for twins in quite a few ways.  <br />
Pierre - His seiyuu has a handsome voice; however, he sure likes to inflect some harshness and increase volume later on.  <br />
Rest of cast - no complaints there, except for Waffle, who is just annoying.  <br />
<br />
If you&#039;d like an easy to get into show with an interesting characters and magical world set up, Sugar Sugar Rune is definitely worth checking out.  I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll ever become more popular than Shugo Chara! But it definitely gives it a run for its money.  It&#039;s one of the cooler magical girl shows that&#039;s for sure!

    This anime is like a dream for young girls.<br />
So fun and flirty. I have watched this anime two times. <br />
First time I watched it, I hated some characters, liked some.<br />
Second time I watched it, I understood more of the reason why the characters acted the way they did.<br />
<br />
Chocolat and Vanilla are the two witches who are queen candidates. Their mission is to capture as much hearts as they can (ecure) and pass exams for the queen seat. During their journey, they were to stay in the human world and collect hearts from humans. Witches&#039; hearts were not supposed to be captured because they only had

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266713">
        one, while humans had more than one. This series has tons of themes and variety of magic that won&#039;t keep you bored for long. There are villians as well, but it only goes into much deeper detail in the second half of the anime. Love this story, great concept. <br />
<br />
Art, at first I didn&#039;t really like their huge eyes, but that was no problem after a while. Their outfits and fashion sense were so cute and stylish and their eyes became part of their charming point. <br />
<br />
Sound, love the opening so much! So catchy and great for a sing along. I would listen to the opening on youtube. Great voice acting and each of the characters sound so individualistic and match their personalities.<br />
<br />
Characters: Great character development. From childish to mature, and dis-like to love. The characters aren&#039;t as bad as they seem in the anime. They each have a hidden side to them. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I enjoyed this a lot, as you can tell by my rewatching although it may be too childish for my age. Age doesn&#039;t matter when it comes to anime.<br />
<br />
Overall: I would very much recommend this anime to the young girls out there, and to the boys if you want to watch this series aimed for the shoujo audience. Magic, love, and whatnot, it&#039;s all in there!

    he first words that come into my mind when i think about sugar sugar rune are: creative and magical.<br />
If you see the first 3 to 5 episodes you maybe thinking that sugar sugar rune is just an ordinary flat plot twisted mahou shojo anime like for example the first season of sailor moon<br />
But if you go on watching you realise that sugar sugar rune is cute is like cotton candy but not all the time. It is definetly not like madoka you shouldn&#039;t expect this but if you understand what the plot is about you would be suprised. <br />
I really appreciate the plot. It suprised

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267135">
        me a lot at some points and the story never get really boring for me. One thing i wanna to mentioned at the end is the &quot;univers&quot; sugar sugar rune plays in. It is really magical and beautiful drawn. I think sugar sugar rune has some of my favorite art style because it is so pretty i can&#039;t stop talking about how good i personally think it is.So i have nothing more to say than if you&#039;re a shojo fan or simply like magical girls please check it out it&#039;s worthy

    I first watched this anime in 2014 and I LOVED it so much I even added it to my favourites. Now, 6 years later, I&#039;m re-watching my favourite animes and my opinion of this series has changed so much. <br />
<br />
When I first watched, I was about the same age as Vanilla and Chocolate so I really enjoyed it. However, now that I&#039;m re-watching, I find it kind of childish. And that&#039;s fine. But the show drags on for really long with a lot of filler episodes at the beginning which don&#039;t contribute to the show. I&#039;m just continuing watching to get to the Pierre part,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344992">
        because I know that&#039;s when it starts to get interesting. It&#039;s already been 15 episodes and Pierre (the main plot/antagonist) hasn&#039;t even done anything and his relationship with Chocolate hasn&#039;t progressed. <br />
<br />
I definitely think this anime could&#039;ve been done in 24 episodes, but I do see the charm in having more. There are definitely morals and messages to be learned, but the episodes thus far feel like filler ones. <br />
<br />
I think younger audiences will enjoy it much more than older ones, since the problems presented in the anime are kind of childish.<br />
<br />
EP. 38 UPDATE<br />
Pierre&#039;s manipulation of Vanilla happened WAY too quickly, he didn&#039;t even plant seeds of doubt until this episode but all of a sudden she&#039;s agreeing with him. There were too many filler episodes at the beginning where Pierre could&#039;ve been better integrated into the plot

    Summary: I watched it and hated it, but I suppose that being a 26-year-old introverted girl who has seen a lot of much better anime has a lot to do with my profound lack of enjoyment of Sugar Sugar Rune. I wish I could say I would recommend it to at least 8 to 12-year-old girls but honestly I can’t say I would: this will be a negative review. Anyone who’s interested in the show’s positive points, please look elsewhere.<br />
<br />
So, Sugar Sugar Rune. I somehow missed the Sailor Moon craze when I was still a small kid so I actually don’t have a lot of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review225177">
        background in mahou shoujo, which I attempted to remedy by picking up this show. The reviews were pretty good, promising a surprisingly nuanced, slightly dark twist upon the genre so often accused of being rife with overblown drama, too much saccharine and self-righteousness. I was instantly attracted by the series’ premise: two young witches who are childhood friends vying to become the next heiress to the Magical Kingdom’s throne. Both have their own sets of strengths and weaknesses, ultimately challenging and completing each other in the new and unfamiliar Human World. Will their friendship endure under the pressure to compete, especially when a mysterious bishounen is thrown into play?<br />
<br />
The biggest disappointment for me will have to be the wasted character potential, translating into wasted plot potential. Ostensibly we have two main characters who balance each other out, and around whose interactions, trials and tribulations I expected the show to be built. First, we have Chocolat Meilleure, an extraverted, bright, spirited, feisty young girl. She is strong and fearless, and while she may be a bit stubborn, brash and strong-headed, she always means well and she’s not afraid to admit her mistakes. She is very open and spontaneous which helps her to make friends, and to those friends that she makes she is fiercely loyal. Her temper and foul mouth are considered to be good qualities in the witch society and a lot of show’s plot revolves around how that clashes with what’s considered good behavior among normal humans. <br />
<br />
Her opponent-cum-best friend is Vanilla Mieux, a lovely, nurturing, gentle and kind girl. She’s introverted, shy, and scares easily, but she makes up for it by being very studious, hard-working and smart, and while her timid demeanor made her unpopular back in Magical World, she has the chance to blossom now that she’s in the Human Realm. Thus, the show had an excellent chance to show how two very different people can walk towards the same goal each in their own way, relying each on their own strengths of character, and still be friends, working together despite all that divides them. “Being friends with someone who isn’t like you isn’t only possible, it’s exciting and opens a lot of possibilities and manners of thinking before you if you’re open-minded and want to make it work”. “If you believe in yourself, work-hard and embrace what makes you unique, you can achieve anything you want”. I thought Sugar Sugar Rune would be about this, or at least something in a similar vein. Welp, forgive me for having high expectations. <br />
<br />
The penultimate quest that drives the plot of this 51-episode series, the mystery of who’s going to ascend the Magical World’s throne proves to be solved in the very first episode. Just by watching the opening and looking at the mid-episode commercial break screens can you accurately say who’s going to be the next queen by the end of the show, roll credits, everybody can go home now. From the very beginning of the show it’s just “Chocolat!” over and over again. My question is: why bother with the pretense of having two main characters, if you’re not going to give the other one equal attention, screentime or development, or any meaningful role at all? Right off the bat you see Vanilla fulfilling just three functions, and those three won’t change at all during the course of the series: a) damsel in distress, b) Chocolat’s caretaker and cheerleader, c) a background off of which Chocolat’s character is constructed and supposed to shine that much brighter. That is to say, the show’s true heroine is Chocolate, and to rub it in we have Vanilla. They are supposed to be these childhood friends with an indestructible bond who complete each other and balance out each other’s flaws but all I have seen is codependence and Chocolat mooching off Vanilla’s goodwill and support.  <br />
<br />
I won’t lie: I have major issues with the brattish character of Chocolat, how they pit her against the gentle Vanilla and every step of the way tell us “Vanilla is okay, but Chocolate is the real star”. They aren’t subtle about it in the least, even their surnames speak volumes: while Vanilla’s means “better” in French, Chocolat’s of course, is the superlative “best”. It seems a bit like a misguided attempt at feminism in the deeply patriarchal Japanese society – choosing a strong and confident girl as the main character above the meek and domestic one is certainly far from traditional and I would applaud it if not for the fact that Chocolat doesn’t have much going for her besides being the not-your-run-of-the-mill magical girl character. She’s brave and strong, okay, I get that and I admire that, but she’s also ridiculously stupid, clueless, annoyingly rude and if not for the help of her friends she would’ve been dead or disqualified ten times over. She’s the focus of the story from day one, and while you would initially sympathize with her because she unwittingly antagonizes everyone in the Human World with her brashness, isn’t good with studies and has no parents or backing in contrast to the well-mannered and well-read Vanilla whose mother is the reigning queen and who enjoyed the life as a princess up until now, you quickly come to realize that Chocolat’s the over-privileged one here. Girls idolize her, boys adore her for being a great pal and occasionally swoon over her tsundere-ness, she has a loving family of aunt, uncle and grandfather, she is super-popular in the Magical World, she has two loyal knights who have been in love with her since back when they were kids (who worship the ground she walks upon and whom she strings along just like that), the mysterious bishounen is head over heels for her and everyone, including Vanilla’s mom queen Candy never shut up about how her courage and strength are exactly what they need in a future queen.  Not to mention it turns out that she has some kind of super-special power to purify evil and her supposedly deceased mom is actually very much alive. <br />
<br />
Vanilla, for her part, has been shunned for her meekness in the Magical World for as long as she remembers, never had any friends besides Chocolat, and while the Human Realm seems to be the place where she can finally be herself and be appreciated for that, it turns out that all the girls hate her guts, and while she seems to do well among the boys, no recurring character of any importance seems to care about her. She has two boys who are shown to be smitten with her, but they are so unimportant we never even get to know their names. She finally seems to get a chance towards more agency and character development near the end of the series with the short-lived Ogre Princess arc, where she decides to quit being on the sidelines and take Chocolat on, embracing her dark side, but even there she’s relegated to being mysterious bishounen Pierre’s second choice and the victim of his machinations. No one seems too worried about her when she crosses over to the dark side, no one makes any persistent attempts to get her to change her mind besides Chocolat. If anything, all the other characters either tell Chocolat she needs to focus on the becoming the queen instead of trying to get Vanilla back, or they want to help Chocolat, but just because they can’t bear to watch her being sad, not because they actually give a damn about Vanilla. She ends up being “rescued” by Chocolat from being the Ogre Princess which is very ironic because it was something that she chose for herself, for the first time in the series. The power of friendship prevails, so to speak, which again would be great if they actually showed us why or how the two girls became friends in the first place and what makes them so irreplaceable to each other, but all we get is “they are and have always been BFFs, just because”. Oh-kay.<br />
<br />
Sugar Sugar Rune is profoundly underwhelming because it flirts with so many interesting themes and then dumps them. The Ogres are the apparent main antagonists, but wait… They aren’t actually that bad, they’re just misunderstood and wrongly oppressed so they have no choice but to fight back? Nah, well, it’s all true but they’re still evil, because damn, we need someone to be a baddie! The witches have hearts, the very essences of their being that they must under no circumstances give away lest they die on the spot? Oh, it turns out that the Ogres can implant black hearts of envy and hate into the witches which let them harness the humans’ negative emotions too, which they normally can’t do AND they get an extra spare heart! Cool, right? Well, turns out it isn’t because the black heart will fight with the witch’s original heart and cause her a great deal of pain. So, the black hearts that represent the negative emotions are supposed to hurt witches, but unless someone sticks the actual thing into their breasts, they can feel sadness, anxiety, jealousy et cetera just fine without any complications or pain. And can I just say one thing about the series’ main love story? When was it exactly that our brazen heroine started falling for the gallant Pierre? Well, kids, it all happened that day when *drum roll* he ate soup with carrots to impress her, and he HATES carrots. Is that super romantic or what? <br />
<br />
With ridiculous, filler-laden plot, two-dimensional characters, lackluster animation and entirely forgettable music, Sugar Sugar Rune is just meh. It might have an interesting premise and a pleasing aesthetic, but with its only message being “you gotta be strong and brave, because if you are nothing else really matters and everyone will suddenly start loving you” it just doesn’t do it for me, as I don’t think it will for anyone with half a brain. It’s just frustrating to watch.

    SPOLIER-FREE REVIEW<br />
<br />
Boy did this anime catch me off guard. When I picked it up I expected it to be nothing special. To say the least, I am currently eating my words. Sugar Sugar Rune tends to strike people as an anime that is easy to guess, predictable even due to the slow pace in the first few episodes. However the story livens up rather quickly. Any true shojo fans will really appriciate the candy corn sweetness this anime has to offer. It&#039;s a magical joy ride with excellent character development and adorable art and animation. It saddens me this anime isn&#039;t as popular as it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17785">
        could be. In all honesty it trumps Shugo CHara! a million times over. The only downside is some of the filler episodes around the middle of the series. <br />
<br />
So if you enjoy magic, shojo based stories, great story lines and cute art you&#039;ll likely enjoy this anime

    i enjoyed this show, but i would have preferred it to retain throughout the carefree, comedic tone of its first 20 or so episodes that were focused on collecting hearts, this way it still could have worked with its young target audience. at the same time, the writers seemed to be running out of ideas for these kinda episodes halfway through, with some episodes being similar to previous ones, maybe they had to hit a 50 episodes mark?<br />
<br />
after this, the writing quality wasn&#039;t up for the darker themes it dabbled with, or for its romantic drama either<br />
it also has some pacing issues, by which the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344030">
        tone of the show changes very rapidly and unnaturally, and it is only on the last episodes the viewer gets much of the story information behind the main conflict. because of it, for most of the show i wasn&#039;t liking the direction it was taking, and by the time of its ending i couldn&#039;t care much about it<br />
<br />
on the positive side, most of the characters are good and develop some good comedic moments, and i really enjoyed the art direction, even if some corners were cut with the animation, the magic and human world look great and are really charming, and this is greatly enhanced by some really nice shibuya-kei infused songs in its soundtrack<br />
<br />
i recommend it to anyone that&#039;s nostalgic for animes from this era or likes the artstyle, even if it&#039;s not the best thing out there

    Coming from a 25-year-old veteran anime/manga lover, I have to say this anime took me by surprise. As a child, I was OBSESSED with magical girl animes, but as I&#039;ve gotten older my tastes have changed. The character development and the ML kept me watching until I finished this!<br />
<br />
Story/Character:<br />
Most of the time, when watching any of these magical girls shows, they tend to keep their villans as bland and simple, but this anime for sure did the opposite. This was my drive to keep watching. If you like a villain that has a backstory and complex layers, you should give Sugar Sugar Rune a shoot!<br />
<br />
I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339151">
        didn&#039;t like some parts of Vanilla and Chocolat&#039;s personalities, but keeping in mind these kids are only 10, helps reason out their actions. Their friendship was so beautiful to me and moved me so! Even though they are competing against each other they are not spiteful and help one another out.<br />
<br />
The romance was sweet, but it bloomed more and more as the show went on, one of my favorite parts of this anime!<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
I didn&#039;t the clothes at all in this show, I think this is the first time I&#039;ve come across an anime where I didn&#039;t like the character&#039;s outfits. I thought there were nice touches when it came to non-human creatures, v.s humans. <br />
<br />
Overall<br />
I am glad I decided to finish this, it was a little slow at first, but is now a part of my favorite anime collections. I think I&#039;ll give the manga a shot too!

    Chocola is an extrovert and an assertive girl, while her friend Vanilla is extremely shy and hesitant; together, they both come from the Magical Kingdom and are the next candidates in line for the throne. In order to qualify to be the Queen, Chocola and Vanilla are sent to the Human World to improve their magic; the assessment is based on capturing the most &#039;hearts&#039; of the people in the Human World. Chocola&#039;s upfront behavior was popular in the Magical Kingdom, but in the Human World, people prefer the personality of her newly formed rival, Vanilla. Now, Chocola must work extra hard to live up

    I think that there&#039;s something about Sugar Sugar Rune which both makes you think, keeps you hooked, and let&#039;s you enjoy the show all at once.<br />
<br />
Now, at first I thought this would just be an anime I wouldn&#039;t get too hooked on and that I could watch maybe 2 episodes a week, but boy was I wrong there - I got so hooked that I finished all 51 episodes in about 3 days!<br />
<br />
The animation, I have to say, could have been a lot better - one of the reasons I had been a bit reluctant to watch it at first was because the animation didn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review146103">
        particularly appeal to me, but once I got used to it after a few episodes I began to appreciate the story for what it was.<br />
<br />
Chocolat is an extremely extroverted, loud, cheery girl who isn&#039;t afraid to stand up for what she believes in. Although this can get kind of annoying sometimes I feel like she really did have the necessary qualities to become the hero. Vanilla is the opposite of Chocolat in terms of personality; she is much more introverted, quiet and, in my opinion, a lot kinder and has a lot more awareness for other people&#039;s feelings, and that&#039;s one of the reasons I quite liked Vanilla.<br />
<br />
Now if we take a deeper look into both the characters and the story, I find that there is a lot more to be gained from this anime than first meets the eye. Although it&#039;s a shoujo anime, I find that the contest between Chocolat and Vanilla to collect the hearts of boys, not to mention all the other witches and wizards who are there also collecting hearts, can have some slightly darker interpretations. The fact that they are able to manpulate the feelings of these humans just for their own personal gain seems kind of sinister and cruel in its own way, because emotions are not there to be manipulated like that and then taken away - I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m able to explain it correctly but to me it just seemed immoral in a way because they make people fall in love with them and then take that feeling away from them.<br />
<br />
For a cynic like me that also exposes one of the fatal flaws of human nature, and that is how easily people can let their emotions get manipulated like that in the face of a pretty girl/boy. Yet another thing that I feel this anime has exposed is how people take things at face value without looking any deeper - what I mean to say is that the way they gain these hearts is through appearance only and not by their true nature. Although there are occurances when it is their true selves able to get a heart, the majority of the time they will put on some form of act in order to make these hearts come out, which is why those who come to the human world become idols of some sort so that they are in the spotlight. I find this to be rather annoying, because the idea of falling for someone based on appearance makes no sense [actually the idea of falling for someone itself makes no sense but that&#039;s a different discussion].<br />
<br />
[A few spoilers in the next paragraph - just a warning]<br />
<br />
Now if we look at Vanilla&#039;s character a bit more, I think she sort of shows how if you&#039;re someone who is always too shy to talk about your own feelings, it can eat you up from the inside. I think that when her own heart turns black is a great way to show this, because she turns from being the sweetest person ever to one of the most cold hearted. It&#039;s sort of a warning in a way, for letting us know that we shouldn&#039;t keep our own emotions in and not talk about things because it can have consequences - and I don&#039;t mean consequences as in our heart turns black and we turn evil, I mean consequences as in emotional drainage and depression etc.<br />
<br />
Chocolat is another character I feel can be analysed quite deeply too. She&#039;s someone who says everything on her mind, quite the opposite of Vanilla, and that&#039;s something I admire her for. However her ignorace at her surroundings, especially at the feelings of the people around her, did annoy me quite a bit, however I think it&#039;s because that sort of reminded me of myself that I still kept rooting for her. Her single mindedness to win, and her loyalty to her friends, as well as seeing how she descovered her own feelings just makes you identify with her no matter who you are really.<br />
<br />
The fact that this anime gave me so much out of it, you know after I got past the disappointing animation quality, says quite a lot. There aren&#039;t many animes, let alone Shoujo animes, which let you explore the characters so much and see them properly on a deeper level.

    Sugar Sugar Rune was not something I thought I would enjoy. I thought it was going to be a frilly- messy plot with no real storyline but, I was wrong. I decided to watch it on a whim and I&#039;m so glad I did.<br />
(SPOLIERS FROM HERE ON)<br />
<br />
Story: I thought the story was A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. I loved how it revolved around two witches who couldn&#039;t be more different from each other and how they had to compete to become queen even though nether of them are really willing to hurt each other for the crown. It also was much darker than I had thought, there was secrets

          <span style="display: none;" id="review126437">
        , lies, betrayal and more (This made the story ten times better)<br />
<br />
Art: The art was okay, it looks about right for the time it came out, I loved the manga art though and how the artist made the outfits so cute.<br />
<br />
Sound: I absolutely loved the 2nd ending, I watch it everytime it comes on.<br />
<br />
Characters: Chocolat was my favorite character because, she was everything she had to be to be a heroine. She is herself and she dosent let anyone tell her how to do things. She&#039;s strong and kind and overall, really likeable. Vanilla on the other hand, I wanted to kill. But, in a way Vanilla being evil was a great twist in the story, it only made Chocolat stronger and work harder. Pierre was a beautiful character, I loved how he had a much darker side at first but it shows how much he wants to be cared for later. I also liked how Pierre wasn&#039;t a sweet guy who only wants to be with chocolat because, it makes it way more realistic that way. Altough he loves her he takes time to fully understand his feelings and try to save himself first.<br />
<br />
Overall: This was a really good Shoujo Manga :) Go watch it now!<br />
<br />

    honestly i thought this was going to be one of those cringy anime where you ended up hating the main character and its a cliff hanging ending where questions get unanswered.<br />
<br />
sugar sugar rune was not any of those. it was absolutely AMAZING i remember watching this when i was young but didn&#039;t finish it since no one was subbing it at the time. but i remember about it to this day as an adult. character development was really beautiful i still hate the character waffle to this day, she was so annoying and every time she appeared i was like &quot;just go away&quot; but she

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303555">
        developed more as the series went on and she became tolerable, still dislike her. other than that its really what a shojou anime should be, the journey of finding yourself (not finding yourself, more like becoming a better you) and lessons about friendship.

    I&#039;ve recently just finish watching Sugar Sugar Rune, and I found myself attracted to the series despite all the faults it has.<br />
<br />
First I must say the animation REALLY turns me down. The anime does little justice to the original manga&#039;s art style. Characters are often distorted, and you see a lot of repeating actions. The anime&#039;s plot line (which is different from the manga) have a few loopholes, but if you can look past it, it&#039;s not bad at all.<br />
<br />
Although Sugar Sugar Rune&#039;s animation isn&#039;t... the best out there, I found myself to really enjoy this show and even write my first review on MAL.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32659">
        The character designs are great, I love the outfits (there are more in the manga) and more so the distinctive personalities. <br />
But what really attracted me to Sugar Sugar Rune is Chocolat. At first I really didn&#039;t thought I&#039;ll like this kind of character, but Chocolat quickly grew on me.  She have a really charming personality, her loyalty to Vanilla is beautiful. *wipetears* And looking at Chocolat&#039;s different hair styles is really enjoyable.  I think Chocolat&#039;s voice actor gave Chocolat her personality and she really stood out from the rest.

    Sugar Sugar rune is of the reasons I became more into anime. I was into anime but this pushed me over the top.<br />
      I always got a weird feeling in my stomach whenever they played the creepy music and pierre came out. Maybe it was their intention, but it was interesting.

    Sugar Sugar Rune is wholesome, comedic, sweet magical girl fun.<br />
<br />
The magical world is an interesting place, along with its customs which led to the story&#039;s plot. The human world is just as colorful. I love the way it integrates the humans and witches. The story may seem typical for a shoujo magical girl series, but it&#039;s done really well and has pretty unique ideas to make them more exciting. Furthermore, it can be funny, dramatic, and romantic.<br />
<br />
The characters are also fun to watch. Chocolat is a great lead and her antics are hilarious. Vanilla is a great foil to Chocolat and their mentor is fun.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369053">
        The supporting cast and antagonists are also entertaining.<br />
<br />
The artwork is really nice and fantastical. The animation has great magical girl elements and the OST is decent.<br />
<br />
Sugar Sugar Rune is an enjoyable watch if you&#039;re into fantasy, magical girls, and shoujo.
