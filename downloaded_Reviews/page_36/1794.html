Watching Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro (Chio&#039;s School Road) felt like watching an experimental humor flick where the show tests the limits of its comedy. I’m not going to lie, this show is very self-aware of its intentions and is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289575">
        never shy to express it. High school girl Chio is an avid gamer with an avid imagination. With every episode being impractical and almost surreal-like, I had no doubt that this series would be popcorn entertainment. To my surprise, it’s the form of popcorn entertainment that deserves more than just a thumbs up.<br />
<br />
The first few episodes makes it clear of what it’s trying to do. The various video game references is clear while we see Chio commute to school in a peculiar fashion. It breaks the boundaries of normalcy as the series tries to stretch its humor at every opportunity it gets. If comedy is what you’re looking for, this will definitely be a crowd pleaser. The key part of the series lies in its ways to sell the comedy. Beyond just the absurd humor of the everyday misadventures, the characters do the selling with their personalities and actions. Chio often defies common logic and applies her video game experiences to real life. This comes from the experience she gains from games that involves stealth, parkour, fighting, and among others. It seizes every chance it gets to demonstrate Chio’s personality and capitalizes on them to the fullest. This may be a make or break for viewers as some may not like Chio herself. However, you have to admit, she is like a pistol that never ceases to surprise me.<br />
<br />
Joining Chio in the show is Manana Nonomura, who happens to be her best friend. She’s also a character that I describe as anti-normal. You’ll often see the pair together and when they are, absurd comedy ensures. In fact, their personalities are even similar despite their different interests. Both characters makes their everyday life events look larger than life. The amount of absurdity is enhanced thanks to Chio’s video game experience such as stealth. In early episodes, she even uses her “skill” to remain undetected from a neighbor while being sneaky in an Assassin’s Creed style. The show also loves to exaggerate the game of kabaddi as Chio and Mana treats it like life or death. Madoka Kushitori (captain of the kabaddi club) also pushes her passion of the game to an absurd level. That being said, I think the comedy level of the show speaks for itself by the time you reach the third or so episode. By then, you’ll really understand this show’s ridiculous comedy.<br />
<br />
While the main duo of Chio and Manana carries a good amount of the series, other characters also comes to play. Despite not being main eventers, characters such as Yuki, Momo, Goto, and Mayuta also brings in their own spice of fun. They amplify the jokes in the show that ranges from forbidden romances to hilarious innuendos. To be fair, this series is like a joke of itself but it knows what it’s trying to be. In other words, viewers should really understand their reasons to watch this show in the first place. If it’s for actual plot or in-depth character study, then this is the wrong place to be. Take this show like a gift that’s ready to be opened and surprise you in ways you’ll probably never be ready for.<br />
<br />
In reality, this anime was originally scheduled to air for Spring 2018. It got delayed for a full season so I assume it’s due to production issues. Nonetheless, the anime maintains a colorful balance of its character designs and setting. It’s not hard to spot the video game references if you’re familiar with franchises like Pokemon Go, Payday, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, Bioshock, and among others. What really made me laugh is the character expressions. It’s exaggerated to maximum effect and often looks far more ridiculous than they should. Chio is the main culprit of this as she makes a huge deal out of situations such as sneaking at night to play video games, getting into an emergency to use the bathroom, or just being anything but normal. This expands to her friend Manana and other characters who takes advantage of all the humorous gags. There’s also some shameless fan service in the show such as pole dancing and delirious delusions. Yuki also makes an example being a sporty girl with an athletic body. The show sure isn’t shy to focus the camera on her whenever it gets that chance.<br />
<br />
For such a show with so much humor, I’m also convinced that the characters were able to deliver their lines flawlessly. The dialogues matches with the character voices that always sounds over the board. Sometimes, it makes me replay certain scenes just to see how far the voice actors seems to be enjoying themselves in their roles. The theme songs of the show are creatively made that does what it’s intended – delivering popcorn entertainment.<br />
<br />
Looking back at this show made me wish that my high school years were as fun as Chio’s. Every day became a story adventure that never ceases to amuse me. From day 1, Chio and the character cast made the best of its humorous elements and never looked back. It doesn’t need a concrete plot to sell its ideas because that’s really not what the show is about. In other words, just watch this show with an open mind and think of how free it is. To be able to deliver such an entertaining series with so many gags is commendable feat if you ask me.

    Have you ever had an anime studio that disliked so much to a point where you absolutely refuse to check out the other works after witnessing some of the shows that they made? Well, I have a big problem with a Studio Diomedéa who up this is point was the studio that I greatly dislike due to them ditching out a truckload of mediocre to awful series that barely had any soul to speak off.<br />
Beatless was the breaking point for this studio as that show was horrendously written that was filled with awful pacing and cringe-inducing production scheduling where every 4-5 episodes that would be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295769">
        pointless recap episodes that barely did anything. That show was so terrible it couldn’t finish it’s 24 episodes run correctly as the final 4 of that shit show had to be done in September…<br />
Because of that I literally gave up on Studio Diomedea by avoiding all of the past and future works. This was until I was introduced to a little slice of life comedy series Chio’ School Road from my friends however due to my hatred with Studio Diomeda for they epic failure that was Beatless into Chio’s School Road with low expectations where I know the show is going to be another third-rate anime.<br />
<br />
I actually thought this anime was going to suck.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; 12 episodes later with the English Dub version<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Looks at the computer black screen smiling.<br />
<br />
Wow, They have finally done it. They finally made an anime that didn’t suck<br />
Chio’s School Road is easily one of the best comedy series I have even. While it’s not on the same level as Hina Festival it still was a fantastically made series that remained funny from start to finish. <br />
<br />
<br />
Chio Miyamo is a self-proclaimed “below average” girl who likes playing shoot-em-ups and Western games. For all, she says she’s “below average”, though, she’s anything but that, given her overactive imagination and her willingness to pull dangerous and impractical stunts. Her most exciting part of the day just so happens to be her commute to school, and it’s not at all hard to see why from delinquent gangs to parkour, kabaddi to competitions with friends, there’s no way that the journey to school could ever be a boring one.<br />
Despite the show being plotless in nature I actually enjoyed the story. The premise itself may be bland at first, however, took that bland and actually made it hilariously entertaining that has a lot of charm and heart.<br />
The characters interactions are very well handled and hilarious to watch as the way the characters react to certain situations and is nothing but comedy gold where we the viewer would laugh for days thanks to the show amazing comedy structure.<br />
The comedy structure in Chio’s School Road is brilliant as not only the comedy/gags are well timed but they also lead a worthwhile impact to the viewer.<br />
Not to mention this is one of the few comedy series that completely avoids the repetitive comedy syndrome where a series would abuse it’s comedy to a point where the comedy and series itself start to it’s losing its charm.<br />
<br />
If you a fan of video games than you will absolutely have a blast with Chio’s School Road as it loves to reference very notable video games such as Assassin’s Creed, Payday, Uncharted, etc. I also really loved how the show was able to blend in its game references with its brilliant comedy structure and as a result, we get a bunch of hilarious scenes that were not only funny but very reliable to the eye especially for Chio’s character.<br />
<br />
Now like with Hina Festival the series has intriguing social commentary for example in one of the episodes we learned that Chio’s is specifically into Western games however due to living in Japan she doesn’t get much chance to play them mainly because they are either overpriced or never got a release at all. Her reaction to towards this is very relatable because that’s how gamers feel in real life where they cannot get the game that wants due to a big paywall that the Japan gamers have to pay. This doesn’t end Chio’s gives a brutal commentary on Japan’s taste in gaming where she talks why little boys in JRPG games carry a big heavy sword as well a big guy not wearing battle appropriate gear as he’s just shirtless showing his manly body holding a sword.<br />
<br />
If had any nitpicks with Chio’s School Road is the kabaddi comedy at times. While it wasn’t bad by any means but it wasn’t my thing at all especially when it’s used from some of the more lewd scenes in this show. Yes, this series has fan-service, but we will talk about that in a bit.<br />
Overall I enjoyed the story of Chio’s School Road. Yes, the story may be plotless however the comedy, character interactions and gaming references really made the show shine in a brilliant and funny way.<br />
<br />
The characters in Chio’s School Road were all funny and enjoyable in they own rights.<br />
My favourite character in the show is Chio herself. She was an absolute adore to watch. I really adored her interactions towards her daily life from Chio hanging around to her closest friend Manana, Chio’s buying a BL magazine from a store to Chio simply playing these western games. Her reactions towards her daily were amazing as it relatable to the eye.<br />
<br />
Next, we have Manana and like with Chio she was a character that I really liked. While she didn’t develop as much as a character compared to Hina Festival’s Hitomi and Anzu but she still a great and hilarious character that I adored. Also, god bless Funimation dub actor Mikaela Krantz for doing a fantastic performance as Chio.<br />
Next, we have Manana and like with Chio she was a character that I really liked. She is an interesting individual who often gets drags into Chio’s shenanigans where she reacts towards Chio’s shenanigans in the funniest ways showcasing that she, not just your typical boring best friend character that we all seen before.<br />
<br />
Chio and Manana have a love/hate relationship with each other were despite them growing up they are still close friends even though they argue with each other every now and then. For example, in episode 6 Chio attempts to scare Manana by Chio popping up from the bridge fence, however, thanks to Chio’s lack of grip energy she gives up the prank by calling her. Then Manana comments on Chio’s behaviour in the most hilarious and factual way possible where it made Chio cry for forgiveness. After Manana forgives her the two aim to get themselves out of the bridge fence as they communicate with each other like actual best friends about the getting off the bridge fence even if they failed in the progress where they both ended up getting stuck in a more worse scenario where it causes them to argue with other. Despite these arguments, they are still best friends and I adore those interactions that these two characters. They are easily the best part about this well-crafted slice of life comedy series.<br />
<br />
The other characters in Chio’s are also pretty cool and hilarious.<br />
We got the biker gang named Andou who completely change his whole life after thanks to Chio and now seen trying to live a normal life by being a decent human being.<br />
There’s also Yuki the energetic sexy girl who is not aware of her sexiness.<br />
The final character that I want to quickly mention is Madoka. She basically this kabaddi expert who has of obsession touching girls asses. While I kinda enjoyed Madoka’s kabaddi antics I thought it was too over the top and creepy for my tastes but what can you do.<br />
<br />
For a studio that has made nothing but low budget works in the past Chio’s School Road stands out for being the best-looking anime from Diomedea. I am honestly shocked of how Studio Diomedea was able to make Chio’s School Road look while Beatless looked like a dumpster fire. It’s honestly quite sad when you think about it. Besides the point, the visuals in Chio’s School ranges from good to pretty great.<br />
The characters designs were pretty good as every single character.<br />
The one thing that I was impressed by is how the show changed its art style. In one episode the series looks like your typical slice of life anime while in the other episode the series looks like an anime that has come straight out of J.C Staff with the number of facials and hair detail.<br />
<br />
The only issues that I had with the visuals were the fan-service. As much as I enjoy starting at Chio’s panties and ass I will admit the show can be a slightly degrading at times plus if your not a fan lewd comedy than this anime won’t be for you.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack of Chio’s School Road is nothing to write home about it as it just a pretty generic slice of life/comedy piece that only serves as background music for the anime.<br />
<br />
The opening theme Danger in my Tsuugakuro sung by Chio, Manana and Yuki Seiyuus is a pretty catchy song that captures the goofy comedy of the series.<br />
The ending theme Nanairoad sung by Chio and Manana Seiyuus is a great ending theme that perfectly closes the episode of Chio’s School Road.<br />
<br />
Now, this is one of the two shows from the summer 18 anime season that I decided to watch fully in dubbed and am going to be real honest the dub is actually pretty amazing. The sub from what I heard was alright but the dub version completely surpassed the sub because not only the voice acting is superior but the dub really fits the tone and comedy narrative of the series better.<br />
<br />
Chio’s School Road is an fantastic comedy series. While it may not be in the same as Hina Festival, it’s still a well-crafted comedy that I adored.<br />
The comedy is hilarious, the characters are likeable and extremely funny. The visuals for a slice of life comedy were pretty impressive, and the dub was awesome. I can easily forgive the not memorable soundtrack as the series is a hilarious fun ride that I loved from start to finish.<br />
It’s honestly shocking of how Studio Diomedea completely redeemed themselves after the embarrassingly directed mess that was Beatless. I am glad that Studio Diomedea had a new leaf after all. <br />
<br />
Well done Diomedea well done.

    Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro is so called bungaku shojo AKA book girl anime. Stories around series like these have varied from girls eating the books they read to them girls getting so sucked in by the story they don&#039;t even realize being molested in the real world. Books can be dangerous like that. Chio is something way more manly and bro.<br />
<br />
The core idea behind Chio is our main character going from home to school, but failing at it. Unlike all the other bungaku shojo series, Chio does not promote reading, but the imagination that she has achieved from various forms of escapism. With her experience of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284889">
        stories, she, for example, gets motivated to go to school by walking on nothing but the roofs of the buildings that lead to her school. During these trips, she loses track of reality, only to find herself cornered in comedic situations in forms of reality check gags. These scenes often take a lot of time and require a long build up. The events that lead to comedic resolutions are typically rather calming, almost looking like child is playing in harmony, perfectly buried in her own thoughts. The resolutions of the gag comedies consisting of various different factors that leave the viewer in no doubt that great amount of planning was put behind them. <br />
<br />
Unlike most daily life comedies, Chio mainly focuses around one sole character and her imagination. Great many of the cornering situations the series creates, Chio overcomes by acting the role of a generic archetype from these fictional stories she consumes. For example, during one scene she has to act the role of a badass yakuza-bro just to not get killed. <br />
<br />
The series does contain great many side characters as well, but their purpose is often mainly comedic. From the teacher who is overly protective of his students to a rich snob who sings songs about poor people being plebs, they all are great addition to the series and the world of Chio. And I, for one, have found all of this to be funny and of respectable quality. <br />
<br />
The comedy centering around other characters heavily relies on our main character narrating her own inner thoughts which are the mixture of uncertainty and the nerdy escapism side in her. This has so far created rather interesting setup for her character development in the forms of her becoming more open about her hobbies and creating bonds with other people. This is quite uncommon for a nichijou series which typically focus on already existing friendships and not on the creation of them. Thus far, I can&#039;t say for certain if this is planned, but so far things seem that way.<br />
<br />
In terms of art, Chio follows a rather simplistic style which is detailed at the same time. It&#039;s the best type simple, the one where less is more. This type productions are very typical for series of this sort, and Chio is among the more pretty ones. You can feel the atmosphere of the series just by looking at the art even if not knowing what the series is about. <br />
<br />
Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro is the comedy series everyone should be watching (or at least trying) this season. Especially the fans of Nichijou, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou and Saiki K, will have high chances finding Chio to be equally great. Of course, there is still the chance that this series will start being repetitive and boring as the same could have happened to the 3 series mentioned above, but gladly didn&#039;t. Hopefully Chio keeps going for better as well. <br />

    Holy sh*t... I am so surprise when seeing this pure gem anime get ~6.9 score in MAL, as I know this (and High School Girl) is definitely my AOTS this Summer 2018, even before it was aired. Why I am so sure? Because I have read the manga far beyond the anime finish in chapter 38 (the anime will finish in chapter 24), and each chapter is pure gold, the most funny thing i have read.<br />
<br />
Yes. This anime is God Tier Comedy anime, equal level as Gintama, Nichijou, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, Saiki Kusuo no Psi Nan, and Senyuu.<br />
<br />
STORY (based on manga i have read)<br />
Chio

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285382">
        is a hardcore PC gamer girl. She played Assasin Creed, Fallout, Counter Strike, Payday, PUBG, etc, every nights, thats why she often woke up late to go to school<br />
The plot usually revolve around chio or her friends got trouble and chio try to use her game knowledge to solve the problem, and her way is truly out of the box which make it so funny to watch.<br />
<br />
For example one time she got in fight with a bike gang leader and act like assasin and resolve with the gang leader fall in love to her<br />
<br />
CHARACTER<br />
Chio: She is a hardcore gamer highschooler, truly imaginative, and creative in resolving the problem she got into. But she is also what you called a little piece of shit. Kinda similar as Gabriel in Gabriel Dropout<br />
Manana: She is Chio best friend. But also a piece of shit like chio. She even dump chio to get a new friend, lie about herself, and call down others, but it always backfired.<br />
If i want to make comparison Chio and Manana relations is same as Mio and Yuuko relations in nichijou<br />
<br />
SOUND and ART<br />
Who care about these superficial things. Watch and judge Anime only by its STORY and CHARACTERS. <br />
Oh, expect a lot of over the top animations similar to Nichijou.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
If you enjoy the God Tier Comedy anime above, and not an elitist. You should be able to enjoy this anime, as much as I enjoy the manga version;<br />
<br />
I purely make this review so more people will eager to watch this gem and increase the average score at least to 9.00<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I make the review above at 29 June 2018 and then got deleted as I have only watched the 1st episode yet.<br />
<br />
Update Review<br />
After watching whole 4 Episodes here&#039;s what I think about the anime right now<br />
<br />
0. Each episode, the show only cover two chapters in the manga (yes each manga chapter is pretty long around 30+ pages). And as there are only 12 episodes of this anime and I already read till chapter 38. So basically I already knew all the plot of this anime till finish, and there are still many chapters in the manga which won&#039;t be covered in this anime. So, maybe this show will get season 2 (I hope so). Or if you are not that patient to wait for season 2, try reading the manga around chapter 25 after this show is finish.<br />
<br />
1. Idk why the show kinda made some character breast look bigger and bouncy which truly degrade this anime as it made this anime seems like worthless ecchi anime, which is totally isn&#039;t. So I hope you just disregard this thing as this doesn&#039;t exist in the manga.<br />
<br />
2. I don&#039;t think the VA for Chio and Manana fit their characters as their voice is too expressionless and soft. For me Chio and Manana should sound like Mio and Yuuki from Nichijou respectively. But I try to watch Dub Version too and I think even though the VA Sounds more like adult than a teenager, their voice has more expression and more fit for the role. So I recommend to try the Dub version too.<br />
<br />
3. Here is the detail of other important characters in this show<br />
a. Andou: He is previously a bike gang leader, but then he falls in love with chio and quit from his gang, and try to get other job, such as working as Newspaper Delivery  and Minimarket Cashier. He also has a super annoying gradeschooler little sister who like to &quot;kancho&quot; other people and become Chio nemesis.<br />
<br />
b. Hosokawa Yuki: She is the first girl who become chio and manana&#039;s friend. From outside she looks like a kind role model students, but inside she is actually a naturalist (read: exhibitionist)<br />
<br />
c. Shinozuka: She is the girl who watch the students entering school gate every morning. She falls in love with the teacher who also watch the gate with her, and asks Chio and Manana for advice, then become the 2nd Chio and Manana&#039;s friend. She is truly piece and kind hearted girl. One time Chio teachs her to kill other people in PUBG, but instead she teachs every people there to have fun by inventing other game there such as play hide and seek, dance, soccer. And after every people satisfied and disconnect, she won the battle royale without killing any single person.<br />

    In the severely lacking Summer season, we got a host of comedy-centred anime, and Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro (or Chio&#039;s School Road) is one of the series that initially doesn&#039;t stand out much, yet for all of its comedic shenanigans and whack-a-mole moments does it hold a candle towards its production runtime and the funny yet insane moments that it has to garner more attention.<br />
<br />
This is the series of brainchild Tadataka Kawasaki, whom started his mangaka life out of various doujins, and Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro is pretty much a rounded compliation of his doujin works. This explains why if you haven&#039;t heard of him before or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289579">
        read a few of his works, the star MC of the show Chio Miyamo, with her weird game analytical vibes and the whole hentai-doujin aspect, made us think that the Chio we know looks a bit off with her blushing and the thingie-of-a-bob sexual erotic feels.<br />
<br />
The awesome comedic manga adaptation follows the life of said always-imaginating Chio-chan, with her dreaded and distasteful life of going to school as a normie. So...on her way, finds spectacular and noteworthy stuff to do to at least make the &quot;going to school&quot; cliché much more interesting, from game references and unsung-hero status to being positions so crazy, such as the worshipped biker gang boss, the famous Indian Kabaddi escapee and more.<br />
<br />
Together with her crazy friends:<br />
Manana Nonomura the loyal (chemistry) mixer but constant revenge-cum-backstabber, <br />
Yuki Hosokawa the innocent but hidden-talented exhibitionist, <br />
and even weirder people such as Madoka Kushitori the Kabaddi master of a senior,<br />
and biker gang boss-turned-follower Andou Mayuta with Chio&#039;s alias &quot;Bloody Butterfly&quot; a massive turn-on, get ready for a comedy so stupendous yet so crazy that will surprise you to no end!<br />
Oh, I&#039;m not forgetting you, Shinozuka and your unrequited love for the constantly-watching teacher, standing beside each other at the school gates!<br />
<br />
Diomedea&#039;s anime adaptation of the underrated manga series is at least faithful or even close to it, and watching every episode and read-comparing through the manga chapters of the said episodic titles made me glad that the comedy is left intact, with some things that had to be dumbed-down (such as the sexual-feel artwork) because of censorship reasons made suitable for TV production. Other than that, while both the art and animation is justifiable by how insane this series started out with, the manga is mildly superior against the anime adaptation, just by a teenie-weenie little bit, but still heaps of fun.<br />
<br />
The sound is arguably the best part of the series. Sound director Takayuki Yamaguchi did his magic here on the foundations of the currently airing Steins;Gate 0 and the upcoming Index Season 3 (as of this review), so...Anisong lovers, you have an OST that is stupendously great and delivers on all fronts to let you know that this show means business, and I mean, wacky-ass comedic business! Definitely love at first hearing for both the hyped OP (by the VAs of the main trio) and the awesome-rhythmic ED (composed by DECO*27).<br />
<br />
Despite the problems that I had started out with, this is still rock solid for similarities in the forms of Nichijou, Daily Lives of High School Boys, Gintama and the like. And like most kids going to school, don&#039;t ever do this IRL! Only Chio-chan does what you can&#039;t! This was a pleasant surprise all around and a great time well spent immersing laughter into. If you like comedy that&#039;s so insane yet watchable, give this one a shot for a really good time, you won&#039;t be disappointed.

    Chio-chan the anime series is the perfect example of an average adaptation. It doesn&#039;t do anything with the manga except worsen the pace.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is pretty good, Chio, Manana and Hosokawa are well cast, sounding like you&#039;d expect the characters to. Andou sounds much older than he actually is, even though the tone of his voice matches his character, he still sounds a bit old.<br />
<br />
The entire production feels incredibly cheap, with the backgrounds often being dull cutouts that you tend to forget about. There&#039;s nothing exceptional about the art at all, but some of the expressions drawn are funny and there are moments when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285283">
        you can tell that they put a lot of effort in the artwork.<br />
<br />
The pacing is the worst aspect of the anime, the manga was very well paced and all the jokes were impactful and hit the mark just right but the anime feels like it&#039;s more stretched out Like it&#039;s a few minutes longer than it should be, and I think it would have been so much better if they squeezed in four chapters per episode. <br />
<br />
The sound design is also bad, moments that would probably be enhanced by sound effects lack that, and it reduces the impact and sometimes makes the punchline worse off. <br />
<br />
The writing is definitely the best part of the series but seeing as the writing is mostly off of the manga, I don&#039;t think the anime should be praised for that. <br />
<br />
Ultimately the anime is incredibly average, even without any comparison to the mange, the anime doesn&#039;t do anything above average, it&#039;s just a throw away seasonal anime with a plenty of laughs but not much more.<br />

    Chio-chan is a comedy show, through and through. In terms of other shows, I&#039;d place it close to Asobi Asobase (but less talking/chatting focused and maybe a little less crude) and Hinamatsuri (but with less action and less of a plot). This is still a SOL comedy, but is not designed to be simultaneously moe, like Yuru Yuri, and is more crude and less quirky than Nichijou. <br />
<br />
Essentially, the show follows Chio-chan and the funny people she interacts with every day, as well as the ludicrous methods she uses to get out of the strange situations she finds herself in. She usually creates problems for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316096">
        herself in fact: being a gamer, she often either acts in a bizarre way based on imagining herself as a character or coming up with a solution that would only be viable in a videogame - yet surprisingly often works out for her. Being a gamer myself, I sympathize haha.<br />
<br />
The show doesn&#039;t really have an overarching plot, but it isn&#039;t meant to. The art is similar to Asobi Asobase. I&#039;m not sure what to call this art style, but I feel like its meant to better contrast against the more common moe moe kawaii that seems more standard in modern SOL anime: seeing reaction faces in that exagerrated style is very funny. The quirky characters also perfectly fit the show.<br />
<br />
I did find the show pretty funny, so I think it succeeds in its primary goal. Part of the draw of these shows is having outwardly pure-hearted and gentle people doing terrible things or having terrible thoughts (like blaming their friends for things they did, faking emotions, using people to get more popular, etc...) - this show has tons of this kind of humour, so give it a try if you like this kind of thing. There is a little bit of crude humour, but it&#039;s really not that bad. So if you are looking for something moe, I don&#039;t think it really fits in there well.<br />
<br />
Categorically:<br />
 - Moe: Not much IMO (except Momo is kind of kawaii)<br />
 - Comedy: Plenty!<br />
 - Drama: None<br />
 - Action: Not really any<br />
 - Romance: None<br />
 - Harem: None<br />
 - Ecchi: A little (quite a decent number of panty shots for instance)<br />
<br />
<br />

    Two socially awkward girls and a track team member walk to school together...<br />
<br />
Craziness ensues...<br />
<br />
Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro is one of the three comedies LA watched in the Summer of 2018 and by god is it not only unpredictable but funny as hell when many of it&#039;s skits lands.<br />
<br />
Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro goes along with the philosophy of running gags but building on those running gags for our main protagonist Chio Miyamo voiced by Naomi Oozora for Chio to go into zanier and crazier situations for herself. <br />
<br />
Chio is a hardcore gamer and below average student, but she a knack for getting herself in crazy situation as she

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289600">
        walks to school be it by herself or with her friends Manana Nonomura voiced by Chiaki Omigawa and Yuki Hosokawa voiced by Kaede Hondo. Chio&#039;s solo antics are actually some of the crazier things to happen in the series and push the series forward to that uncanny valley of craziness as most of her skits leads into a flow-on effect in some skits afterwards, the easiest one to note of being of &quot;Bloody Butterfly&quot;. Now that isn&#039;t to say that Manana and Yuki doesn&#039;t help in making the comedy even better as they are great foils to Chio, from Manana taking full advantage of Chio whenever she can and of wanting desperately of wanting be with their cool kids due to Chio&#039;s out of nowhere friendship to Yuki, one of the more popular girls in her school and having a rather abnormal obsession with running. Chio and Manana&#039;s chemistry works well for the most part with some of the more psychological friendship teases and when it&#039;s tested it shows that they are best friends by the end of it, as much as most of the time it doesn&#039;t. Yuki is something of a straight man to Chio and Manana&#039;s situations but considering she has a few weird quirks of her own, she isn&#039;t exactly a straightforward straight man and can easily get entangled in Chio and Manana&#039;s crazy antics in the process. Really when the skits involves Chio, Manana and Yuki, it&#039;s a psychological battle compared to Chio&#039;s more &quot;physically defining&quot; skits.<br />
<br />
There are few minor characters like Andou voiced by Rikiya Komiya of a biker gang to befriends Chio in the typically crazy way and the anime even teases that there&#039;s something between Chio and Andou, the other character that gets screentime is Madoka Kushitori voiced by You Taichi who is the leader of Kabbidi but she just wants to grope highschool girls ass...no seriously, as much she does help in some situations, LA felt Kushitori&#039;s skits in general to be the most uninteresting as much as LA loves yuri undertones, LA thinks Kushitori is underplaying the word &quot;undertones&quot; due to her running gag of groping through Kabbidi and finally we have Momo Shinozuka voiced by Minori Suzuki, who&#039;s head of the disciplinary committee and she has a bit of May-December romance with Goto-sensei voiced by Hiroki Takahashi and it&#039;s obvious of her crush towards Goto-sensei but it&#039;s never shown if Goto-sensei knows it&#039;s mutual not to mention all the taboo this situation presents, Momo and Goto-sensei&#039;s skits are more laid back and quite unique from Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro, we do get some backstory to how Momo is how she is now but it&#039;s vastly offbeat compared to Chio and Manana&#039;s antics...LA guesses it&#039;s something to shake up the skits in Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro but it&#039;s moodwhiplashing to say the least in the loosest way possible.<br />
<br />
Most of Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro&#039;s comedy is situation based and this works to Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro&#039;s building running gags philosophy and as much as there are ALOT of running gags, for some reason, they don&#039;t &quot;really&quot; become boring over time, mainly because of the crazy situations Chio goes through some having mundane turned awesome in this regard and the payoff to most of the skits gives us (be it from subverting expectations or the other spectrum which is going completely insane in it&#039;s simple premises it sets up) and better yet Chio&#039;s running gags does have consequences later on and aren&#039;t glossed over because of it thus making it&#039;s running gags evolutionary to how the plot progresses and how Chio and it&#039;s cast acts in the moment.<br />
<br />
Though comedy is subjective, where LA saw Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro fall flat is when it&#039;s comedic skits goes off rhythm from it&#039;s evolving running gags it set up for itself, mainly on it&#039;s more isolated skits but not all of them. Again LA would have to say Kushitori&#039;s running gag are sometimes unpredictable but it&#039;s Kushitori as a character LA had a problem with...even if LA likes yuri, Kushitori&#039;s methods *ahem* kabbidi groping is not. Finally as much as LA that many of Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro&#039;s skits are unpredictable considering how crazy Chio and the cast gets up to, sometimes you can glimpse the punchline because of the setup. As LA said comedy is subjective and that doesn&#039;t hugely detriment Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro&#039;s base comedy it has going for itself, but it&#039;s there nonetheless. Though LA will give some defense to LA&#039;s telling flaws of Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro of it&#039;s isolated skits, yes they are isolated, but some have a flow on effects in future skits further down the line, sure it&#039;s simple as introducing a the same character from a previous skit and pr a character remembers what Chio previously did to kick start another skit but it&#039;s still there, so the isolated skits DOES have some merit to itself that continues with it&#039;s evolving running gags. philosophy.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation done by Diomedea, the animation has it&#039;s great moments mainly with the crazy reaction shots and over the topness of the scenario and LA will praise the good animation across the board for Diomedea even for a straight up crazy comedy series, the best examples is when Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro changes art styles, anything from a kids drawing to troll us to insane facial detail for a single shot of the character that doubles into great overreacted character animation as a whole and sometimes imaginative intensity from the character&#039;s point of view eg. explosions or characters perceived as something else much zanier or stronger. Character designs are moe but has that almost trolly feel when the animation converts into chibi form and LA thinks that is the point. Nonetheless LA thinks Diomedea somewhat took the animation seriously and took itself that far to make a crazy series come to animated form and went ham on the animation whenever it could and LA loved it.<br />
<br />
Voice acting-wise, well hello Naomi Oozora doing your Satania McDowell voice again and LA was pretty satisfied. Yes one of the reason why LA wanted to watch this series was because of Naomi Oozora and by god did Naomi Oozora did amazingly well in her cadence of being simultaneously crazy serious, derpy and intentionally bland all at the same time with her comedic timing pretty much down. Chiaki Omigawa did great as Naomi Oozora&#039;s foil Manana Nonomura with her quick quips and again good reaction times as well and nonetheless this was definitely a different side from Chiaki Omigawa that LA didn&#039;t expect from her. Kaede Hondo and You Taichi did well as well as Yuki Hosokawa and Madoka Kushitori respectively and they contributed alot with some decent chemistry between the cast as well but obviously LA would crown Naomi Oozora as MVP in this anime...because of course LA would...<br />
<br />
LA watched the Funimation dub of this anime too and Mikaela Krantz as Chio was a shoe-in and almost near similar to her Japanese counterpart, Emily Fajardo also did similarly as Mikaela did, like she was really into her character. The Funimation dub also goes with the full gaming slang and internet dialogues in which the original Japanese counterpart had only lightly dabbled into but the Funimation dub felt like the slang was much more intense. Like Naomi Oozora taking the Japanese MVP, Mikaela would get the MVP for the dub side of things. Nonetheless with such a minimalist casting, the casting on BOTH the dub and sub were great.<br />
<br />
Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro has it&#039;s major strengths, from it&#039;s absurd comedy and overreactions, insane characters all under a simple setting of a schoolgirl just walking to school and what LA sees in most good comedies is using it&#039;s running gags and evolving them throughout the anime, like the running gags are moving with the plot like it&#039;s characters that has to handle it&#039;s consequences in the process. But like most comedies, some of it&#039;s skits doesn&#039;t land *cough* Kushitori as a whole and some of it&#039;s skits do not evolve and are completely isolated but nonetheless Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro was a great situational comedy with not only good production value from diomedea of all studios, great voice work from both it&#039;s dub and sub.<br />
<br />
Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro was LA&#039;s 2nd favourite comedy of Summer 2018 even with all it&#039;s flaws LA just can&#039;t help it, Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro was just crazy, mundane made awesome fun comedy with a crazy cast of characters and though it dips in it&#039;s comedy sometimes nonetheless Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro holds out a strong front on it&#039;s comedy across the board and sticks to it in all it&#039;s absurd nature most of the way through.

    As with all comedy shows, one&#039;s enjoyment largely depends on the kind of humour the show uses. That&#039;s why I will try to explain the kind of jokes you can expect from Chio-chan, so you can decide for yourself whether it may suit your taste! <br />
<br />
This anime often uses somewhat &quot;inappropriate&quot; humour. You can expect some rudeness, vulgarity and lewd situations, but it never reaches the levels of &quot;Prison School&quot; or &quot;Detroit Metal City&quot; in that regard. So if those shows were too extreme for you, you might still enjoy Chio-chan since it&#039;s tame by comparison. It has a lot of panty shots and some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289590">
        boob jiggles, but they are either used for the sake of comedy or are not too &#039;in your face&#039;. I also like that this show doesn&#039;t rely too much on the &quot;meme face&quot; kind of comedy that&#039;s popular nowadays.<br />
<br />
It also has its fair share of absurdity. Oftentimes the situations the characters find themselves in are strange enough to make you laugh. Unlike shows like Nichijou for example, it&#039;s not random for the sake of randomness though. The situations in Chio-chan are often built around the awkwardness and stupidity of the main characters, so there&#039;s a bit of &quot;cringe humour&quot; going on as well. Though it&#039;s not nearly as extreme as the stuff you would find in &quot;Watamote&quot; for example. The main characters can be somewhat assholish at times, but they still remain relatable and likeable. It&#039;s fun to see them getting their comeuppance at the end of a skit! The show also uses quite a few nerdy videogame jokes.<br />
<br />
I am fond of the pacing of the show. It is not as fast-paced as shows like &quot;The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.&quot;, but the skits never overstay their welcome either. Even if a longish skit doesn&#039;t land the joke, there&#039;s bound to be something else that cracks you up in the rest of the episode.<br />
<br />
As for the other aspects, you shouldn&#039;t expect a well thought out story or deep characters from this series. It has some nice bits of continuity, but first and foremost it&#039;s a skit comedy anime. The art style is pleasant and fun to look at and the character designs are cute and unique. The music is fine and the main tune they sometimes use is even somewhat catchy. While the technical aspects of the show aren&#039;t mindblowing, I think it&#039;s fair to say that they are still above average!<br />
<br />
If you like what you&#039;ve read, then you should definitely check this show out! If you are not completely convinced after the first episode, you should check the next (few) ones as well, to get a complete picture of what kinds of jokes you can expect from this show. It&#039;s definitely a worthwile watch!

     Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro is a fun, simple slice-of-life anime and I had a rather good time watching it. It shares a lot of similarities with Watamote, seeing as both shows are about plain, nerdy girls who are obsessed with video games, have trouble falling asleep, and have acute social anxiety. Though Chio isn&#039;t quite as kneecapped socially as she is able to function in most situations, and had a regular cast of friends. Also, this show has a lot more fanservice than Watamote, despite Tomoko having a dirtier mind in her show. Finally, this show doesn&#039;t really get into deeper questions about anxiety or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382391">
        self-worth; everything is very surface level in that respect. Regardless, given the similarities that I felt required mentioning, I feel the comparison between the two shows stands on its own. This brings me to a more generalized discussion of the story, which is very simple and rather foolproof. First, Chio sets out to get to class on time. Then she runs into one of her friends, usually Manana. As they head to school, they run into a challenge which requires some action or decision, and shenanigans ensue, sometimes further involving more characters, like Andou or Kushitori, or the bum that Kushitori takes life lessons from in the park. Each of the 12 episodes is a self-contained serving of this formula, usually containing a few cycles of this setup with minor variations on the theme, like when they introduce a new character. It addresses certain themes, like friendship and social anxiety, though it doesn&#039;t go into them at any greater length, keeping it lighthearted. The pacing can sometimes feel rushed, and certain storylines feel like throwaways, but again given what kind of show this is trying to be this isn&#039;t a grievous sin. This show isn&#039;t a pioneer when it comes to storytelling, but uses its formulaic approach to its overall benefit regardless. The art direction is good, at least as good as a modern anime should be expected to be, with brief flashes of a greater flare, like when Chio imagines life as a video game, or one of the characters says something embarrassing or stupid and the art style suddenly changes. On that point about artistic augmentation, the way use this method reminds me very much of Nichijou. The very brief uses of 3D in regards to background characters are scarcely noticeable, which is good because they are bad. The character design is perfect for the show as well, and Chio is memorable at the very least by right of her design. The sound design is good, again nothing less than what should be expected, though it is mostly the music and voiceover. The voiceover is energetic enough to cover up the fact that there really aren&#039;t that many &#039;sounds of life&#039; as I like to call it. The characterization starts out very strong and keeps this level of quality throughout, though the characters, outside of Andou, don&#039;t really change, which I think is fine considering what kind of show it is. The chemistry that the characters share is very strong, especially between Chio and Manana, and is one of the show&#039;s definite strong suits that puts it over the edge for being a better-than-average show. Overall, Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro is an entertaining and easy-to-digest title that doesn&#039;t try to be too ambitious with it&#039;s concept, all the while utilizing its own style with noted skill, which in the end makes it easy for me to recommend.

    When I first saw its description around the beginning of the spring season, I thought it would be another weird anime that people latch onto. You know, your Pop Team Epics, your Mahou Shoujo Ores, those weird anime that still are strangely good (or bad, whatever your taste is). I was already sure that I would watch it, but I didn&#039;t had high hopes at that time for this anime.  <br />
<br />
And now, after 2/3 months of abstence in anime and spring season gone, I finally had the time to watch this anime, and wow. This anime is waaaay better then I expected it to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285797">
        be. Well, grab your bikes and game your way to victory, here is my review of Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro.  <br />
  <br />
Story: 8/10<br />
Chio walks to school. That&#039;s the whole premise.<br />
To be more exact, every episode has two or three stories which all involve in some way Chio walking to school. It may be not always the focus of that story, but it is always involved in the stories. Even with that in mind, the general plotline is really, really good. Some stories have one-off things and other follow what happened in a other story. Some stories have returning characters and events, other have Chio just solo. Some stories are simple and funny, other are batshit crazy and awesome. This kind of variety makes the general plotline so much better.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The art is really good for this kind of comedy show. It knows when it has to settle down and when to go crazy. The expressions are really good too: the characters are really expressive and brings some really funny faces, kinda like Hinamatsuri from last season.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
OP and ED are really good. Both rock songs that I will be jamming throughout the season. I don&#039;t remember the rest of the soundtrack, but the OP and ED are so good that I just can&#039;t help but to give it a 8.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8/10<br />
While myanimelist only lists four characters, there are two more characters that I want to briefly mention: That bike dude who looks like Yohsifumi from Hinamatsuri and the principal who has some really funny lines. So with that said, the main is pretty good: Chio (the main character) is pretty shy girl with a love for games, Manana is kinda like Chio but without the love for games, Yuki is the popular who tries to be nice to everyone and Madoka is a lesbian who practices kabaddi (kabaddi kabaddi kabaddi kabaddi). A overal good to great cast. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
The humor is amazing. It mostly involves around Chio and Manana being awkward and Chio having a &#039;&#039;gamer brain&#039;&#039;. Even with that the humor has a ton of variety and hits the good spots multiple times. I was laughing multiple times. I also love the Chemistry between the characters which brings some pretty funny and heartwarming scenes that are really memorable. This makes Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro the funniest anime this season, maybe even more funnier then Hinamatsuri.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
This is a great anime that you should watch. Every aspect is solid and the amazing humor only makes it better. The only significant downside of this anime is that it makes me wish that going to school was this exciting.

    Chio&#039;s School Road had some potential for greatness. The main character actually has a personality, coming off as a adventurous, kind, witty, timid, bitter, daring, and strangely focused on being &quot;below average.&quot; She&#039;s a bit all over the place, displaying many different traits and thus capable of reacting and starting many scenarios and dialogues with a variety of poeple.<br />
 Manana reminds me of Honako from Asobi Asobase, which is a good thing. She&#039;s not exactly the straight man character, but she plays off of Chio quite well. These two main characters are quite good, and there&#039;s a lot of possibilities for each scene and chapter

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408623">
        they&#039;re in. They make a good duo. <br />
However, the magic ends there. Chio&#039;s school road at its best does remind me of Asobi Asobase, lingering in its shadow and almost breaking free to be its own series. Unfortunately, more often than not, it&#039;s pretty bad. This can be drawn up to two main reasons: Cringe and terrible supporting cast. While Chio and Manana are interesting characters with unique ways of thinking and provide good commentary to situations and also creating them in different scenarios, the supporting cast just ruins a lot of the momentum that they bring. The other characters are just atrocious. There are only a few side characters, but even then, they&#039;re all garbage. Andou started off strong, but developed into a cringe one dimensional love interest for Chio. Madoka is just lesbian fanservice, and Momo...I don&#039;t even know, just a random side character that likes Gotou? Yuki&#039;s probably the only half decent side character, but her personality can be summed into three traits: popular girl, track and field, and naive? Like I said, she&#039;s ok, but it&#039;s still a far less than stunning cast of side characters which bring nearly nothing to the table other than cringe dialogue.<br />
<br />
The cringe in this series is strong as well. Chio being a &quot;gamer&quot; and the series focusing on that is cringe in itself. Haha, wow, I play games. WOW, Chio plays games too?!?!?? It&#039;s so funny watching her mimic game movements or try to parkour real life obstacles just like in games! Super relatable!!! Like I said, Chio has a lot of character traits, but this &quot;gamer&quot; one is such a surface level character trait. It just randomly appears in scenarios sometimes, but usually, episodes don&#039;t even feature her interest in games at all, and when they do, it&#039;s always just an &quot;obsession&quot; where she&#039;s like &quot;haha this looks like something I would do in a game,&quot; and she parkours it. it doesn&#039;t actually influence her actions normally, but when the scenario demands it, it completely engulfs her without much rhyme or reason. The other side of the cringe coin is the ecchi humor. Haha, lesbian trying to grab girl&#039;s ass. Funny!! Isn&#039;t it super funny when there&#039;s a random panty shot and unnecessary large boob physics? I think you get the idea. <br />
Plus, overall production value is not that great. The artstyle is simplistic but not in a good way. The shadows and backgrounds are extremely simple, and faces plain. there&#039;s always this weird &quot;blush&quot; effect on their faces, which is really grating and odd. There&#039;s not much fluid motion in the series overall, and it kind of feels cheap, but it&#039;s also a comedy so it&#039;s less of an effect than you&#039;d think.<br />
Overall, the series is nine parts cringe, 1 part comedy.<br />

    I&#039;ve always thought that Comedy anime must be one of the hardest genres to choose for an Anime, specially when dealing with its own comic formula while trying not to abuse it to the point of not being funny anymore. Then there are those anime which relies on terrible jokes that makes no sense whatsoever or that are cringy as fuck like the case of Grand Blue. Now, Its time for Chio&#039;s School Road which honestly, took me by surprise. At first, I thought that it would be your typical comedy anime that would abuse of its comic formula during 12 episodes of the same

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284939">
        thing while jokes end up being predictable and unfunny. Gladly, it wasn&#039;t the case for this anime.<br />
<br />
The story on this anime is almost nonexistent as the anime relies of short-lengthened episodic gags, so if you expect a significant plot, you might have the wrong anime here. But, if you are here to have fun, I welcome you, because you&#039;ll probably have a great time watching this anime.<br />
<br />
So, what exactly is &quot;Chio&#039;s School Road&quot;? As the sinopsis already states, this anime is a compilation of short-lengthened gags that occurs on the path that our MC &quot;Chio-chan&quot; takes to assist school. Chio-chan must be the most unlucky girl on town because she finds herself into really odd situations that would get her either expelled from school, or get her really REALLY bad reputation among other students. What does this anime have that other comedy anime doesn&#039;t? While other comedy anime fails at abusing its comic relief, This anime relies on short funny gags, that will not make this anime abuse its comic relief anytime soon, specially when Chio-chan gets the most unsettling ideas to get out of whatever she encounters that might cause her misfortune (and her friends reactions of course) As an example, who hasn&#039;t been on an embarrassing situation where someone in front of you greets someone behind you and you mistakenly think that the greet was for you?<br />
<br />
Lets jump straight to the main duo, which are the reason why this anime isn&#039;t half bad. Chio-chan is a gamer girl who gets herself into odd situations on her way to school, and even in the most tight moments, she always find a way to &quot;fix&quot; her problems (by giving herself more trouble lol) and succeed on it with the most idiotic, yet, fun ideas. Then we have Manana, who is Chio-chan&#039;s best friend who will tag with her on her way to school on most of the gags (Featuring VERY ODD YURI MOMENTS XD!) She might look like the most &quot;normal&quot; girl on the show, but she proof me wrong several times with most of her actions. The rest of the cast is there to get their screen time on different gags, but they also get the spotlight when it comes to Chio-chan&#039;s misfortune. Neither of them ceases to amuses me.<br />
<br />
Art is good so far, that, if you don&#039;t mind some panty-shots and extreme facial expressions. Sound is good on its own, specially with the voice acting.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8/10: I really underestimated this anime after the first episode, its has become really funny and I expect it to be even better by the time this season ends.<br />
<br />
Overall 7/10

    The story of this anime is really OK, but what makes it so good and fun to watch is not the story. You know, after watched this anime, i start to rethink of what makes an anime, an anime? i&#039;m never think about this before, but after watching this, it makes me think you know? If you haven&#039;t think about it before, try it!<br />
The answer for me is, if the anime is memorable enough and you can&#039;t even forget about it, it what makes the anime, anime. No matter how bad it is as long you remember how silly or how great it is, it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290699">
        what makes it great.<br />
<br />
So let me tell you what&#039;s so good about this anime. The character stay in character, the art is increasing in a good and right way as the show goes. At first you know some character and especially the main character, all of it is actually your typical anime character, but what makes them memorable is that they (who make the anime) can make the character so suit the anime.<br />
Or in other way i say it, the character is what makes the anime good and fun to watch.<br />
From how they tell or bring the story, to how they end the story, the art and the Seiyuu is what makes the anime feels so alive.<br />
<br />
More of it, if you are a gamer (especially if you are since jhs), you will find so much similiarity with the main character. i see the gamer side of the main character makes it even more entertaining. idk maybe because i know what all the references of the game on the anime are so i feel so joy. But if it is about the game i don&#039;t think its gonna excite me to watch it this much! <br />
I think what makes it entertain to watch because it feels so relatable with me. The way she play the game overnight, and meeting other people online, its just feels so real.<br />
I never think way go to school this fun before, and this anime show me how fun it is.<br />
<br />
And i think the art is what makes it even memorable. At first it may be seems like usual art but as the anime shows its true self, it will also shows its true art too, from your usual art to the art that makes you love it because its unique.<br />
The ost is suit too, i love some of it, it kinda relaxing so its suit the anime so well.<br />
<br />
I was wishing to see this anime in the future, because it has so much potential, even i want to try to eat some more from the manga, but then i realize how little i know about it.

    Honestly didn&#039;t know what to expect from this show. The premise is about as mundane as it can get: our main character and her daily commute to school. What the show uses a lot for it&#039;s comedy elements is Chio wanting to just skate by on life and just play video games until 5am every day. Having a character wanting to avoid contact from other in the most over the top means thus drawing attention to her crazy antics makes for very easy comedy. While that is the majority for the gags in the there are a few narratives that it builds up keeping the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299602">
        comedy fresh. One of the strongest toolboxes for any comedy is it&#039;s supporting cast. The supporting cast in Chio&#039;s school road is strong with a good range of recurring characters all with their own gags. Top 5 comedy anime far as I&#039;m concerned.

    A school comedy features the main cast of characters spending the runtime in the school and the various antics that go about during that period of time.  But what would happen if we instead made a school comedy...about GOING TO SCHOOL?!  Genius!  And that&#039;s what brings us here today.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Miyamo Chio is self-described as a below average student who doesn&#039;t want to stand out.  But due to her gamer brain and hilarious tendency to overthink things and perceive them as worse than they are if she acts normally in the moment, her walk to school just becomes a little more unique, usually ending with encounters with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289615">
        biker gangs, parkouring over buildings, or landing facefirst into garbage in order to try and avoid attention.<br />
<br />
As a comedy series, Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro is a show that heavily features situational comedy, being that any and all situations can and will be twisted to get a laugh out of the audience, and watching Chio try to get out of any given situation to make it in time for school is the bulk of what is to be experienced watching this.  This primarily comes from the fact that characters typically overthink any given situation before acting, thus creating an action and reaction scenario that makes the show what it is.  <br />
<br />
Beyond that, the concept of Chio-chan really helps in its variety, as since the show is about one girl finding her way to school through various obstacles, each episode brings about something new with only a few constants for familiarity.  Chio pretty much takes a different route to and from school each episode, and that helps make give the show the kind of variety it needed to be successful.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Consistent situational comedy<br />
+ Variance to make it a lot more interesting<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Miyamo Chio is an introverted protagonist who doesn&#039;t want to stand out.  As comedic irony comes to play with her going to standoutish lengths to not stand out, the crux of her character comes with her prominence as a gamer, as well as how often she will overthink things prior to acting to them.  The latter part is the more important part of her personality, giving the show the kind of exaggeration it needed to embellish the story, as well as making up the ludicrous thought process one needs in order to figure that parkouring over buildings is much easier/faster than just taking the marked detour.  <br />
<br />
While the series primarily focuses on Chio, Manana, her compatriot, throws a number of wrenches into the mix being Chio&#039;s &#039;friend&#039;.  (She&#039;s really more of a frenemy.)  A girl who desperately wants to get out of her clique and become one of the popular girls, Manana acts as both a comrade and rival to Chio&#039;s current predicament, making their relationship amusing to watch since the two can be at odds with one another in one scene, and work together in another.  This is also helped by the fact that Manana also exhibits the trait of overthinking, playing mind games alongside Chio to outwit, outsmart, out-whatever at the current situation at hand.<br />
<br />
Other characters include Andou, a retired biker leader, Hosokawa, the airheaded star athlete whose desire to run/do track outweighs common sense/though, and Kushitori, the series&#039;s resident sexual predator.  (Because we needed one of those.)  The side cast typically is only there to enrich the situations that Chio finds herself in, providing a goal, target, or compatriot to the obstacle on her way to school that becomes the focal point for the episode&#039;s A or B plot.  Not only that, but their prominence in the series makes them really memorable, as the smaller sidecast really makes a difference on how developed each individual character becomes by seeing how far their respective traits can be pushed.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Entertaining cast<br />
+ Memorable sidecast<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Produced by Diomedia, the art for Chio-chan is pretty average.  The company is pretty consistent through their recent works, but the art doesn&#039;t stand out very much.  This unfortunately extends to the comedic off-modeling that&#039;s used for character exaggeration, making it so that nothing is really that changed even if used for the sake of comedy.  Your typical school comedy tropes like exaggerated faces, background changes, what have you are the kind of fare you&#039;ll see here, so nothing too out of the ordinary.  <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
&quot;Danger in my Tsuugakuro&quot; sung by the seiyuus of the main girls is a song that doesn&#039;t really stand out too much beyond the first ten seconds where we&#039;re introduced to an electric guitar riff that makes it seem like it&#039;s a song that&#039;s more than something sung by the voice actors.  Honestly I expected a little bit more, but it does the job.  Its ED sister, &quot;Nanairoad&quot; is very similar in the same regard, also being a seiyuu song and doesn&#039;t really stick out as an amazing track.  It&#039;s unfortunate that this show didn&#039;t receive anything that really went along with what the show was about, since there are numerous things in this show that you don&#039;t find in a typical school comedy.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
As far as school comedies go, this was about what I expected for something about a novel idea.  Being about going to school instead of being at school made it possible for the show to have all sorts of various scenarios, making each episode its own experience different from each other.  <br />
<br />
As for a recommendation, a stamp of approval for a decent comedy is what I&#039;d give it.  Its variance is definitely is strong point, and the kind of situations Chio finds herself in is the highlight of the experience.  So if you&#039;re looking for a good comedy to wet your whistle, this is a good show for that niche.

Overall, Chio-chan is a normal serie for me. It isn&#039;t special like other people said. It has some kind of flaws in their jokes and ideas which most of time, make me feel like an idiot if I don&#039;t get the jokes or references in the serie which isn&#039;t normal thing as many good laugh series in 2018 like Hinamatsuri or Asobi Asobase can give me some laugh even though I don&#039;t get everything. 2 out 12 episodes are the best thing that make Chio a good serie for me which are episode 2 and 4. Others than that are kind

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293842">
        of bad. First let&#039;s us start at the bad point or the point that I don&#039;t personally like.<br />
<br />
1.) This serie rely on too much references and play jokes around them which most of the time, make some part of the serie feel so cringe, forced and have no creativity or adaptation while playing them. These references and jokes are just there for viewers who understand them to feel special but for those who don’t understand them or don’t care can get extremely boring and feeling left out during the entire watching experiences. Watching this serie in the late part feel even worse as there are no creativity in the serie much. If they want to be funny they can be either weird as shit or playing on references.<br />
<br />
2.) To be honest, for some people they may feel that this serie (sometime) presents so smart with their humorous social topics playing and references but it just in some episodes that are special but in the overall picture, this serie isn’t quite different when compared to other serie in the same comedic genre. The only things that make this serie special are unique social topics playing in both context and joke, otherwise everything are just copy pasting from other series which usually have unnecessary fanservice, dumb joke that only dumb as much as possible, plot context and scenario which others serie have done before and sexual and adultarise jokes which way far too much used. <br />
<br />
3.) The ideas presentation in this serie are the most random things most viewers couldn’t even imagine in the entire world. This is one of the most random serie in the ideas presentation among the school life comedy genre I have seen for a while. These ideas at first look like the story of weird innocent living of nerdy girls and environments around her but when the serie go on much later, these ideas become everything they want to be. They are not even about Chio or school anymore. They are just random skits and story about references and weird shits that don’t even incorporate with anything in the first place. When the time go on and on, this serie can change to be any genre which later make the serie have no main theme or even point to focus at all.<br />
<br />
4.) This is the thing that many serie in comedy genre nowaday in anime industry likely to pull off and it isn’t even funny in the long run (it feel like trend than a creativity) which is sexual, social criticism and adultarise jokes. Sometime some serie can present these jokes along with the plots in the very smart ways but in Chio’s case, most of the time these are there so the serie could be more funny in the forced and cringe way. This serie try to create every scenes and build-ups to make viewers feel like these jokes are the most amazing and creative joke in the serie which isn’t true when there are around million series who try to do the same trick and later as this serie is lazy in their story and joke writing, it later create un-appropriate meanings and morals which even make this serie is way worse than it should be as it only treat this jokes to be only funny things. Such as the Kabaddi thing, that yellow hair lesbain hentai girl and the horny homeless man. These things are completely horrible in my opinion to be honest.<br />
<br />
5.) This serie has a lot of repetitions and scenes that keep presenting the same story, plot and jokes. The moral or even main point of these scenes are likely the same most of the time that making viewers to guess the next scenarios and jokes so easily they always go in the same pattern. The serie in each episode always start with one problem (only one at time to make viewer use less brain) that could be from both old and new character and the scenes will dedicate to play the plots, references and jokes to it and always end with twist things. This easily create circumstances of boring long run viewing experiences as you can watch (only) good or favourite episode and don&#039;t care about the others that are likely the same but worse or boring.<br />
<br />
6.) This serie has some kind of weird storytelling which viewers can likely to blame this problem on the direction and serie composition department entirely. The reason is because how they clearly have no plan on what to put and what to play in each scenes and episodes that will make the story make more sensical and easier understandable. No creativity or no visualize play to help root this problem at all. They feel like to put any plots in any moments with no settlety and build-up. The animation departments (the cuck Diomedea’) do whatever they want. They don’t care about the overall structure of plot and tone. They only care about every episodes to be as funny and cringy as much as possible. Making this serie to have a very weird storytelling that keep going around and back and forth development and progression.<br />
<br />
For the thing I like or good point of the serie, I might say it is this serie&#039;s main cast, Chio and Manana’s character design and voice acting. Main cast characters&#039; designs are very likeable. They are like real friends who aren&#039;t always say nice thing to each other. They are very dynamical and always fulfill each others&#039; stories with each unique personality. The voice actings from these two characters are amazing. They know how to keep their voice to have unique personality and be entertain most of the time. And finally I recommend you to watch this serie in episode 2 and 4. These two episodes are one of the best comedic sequences I have ever seen in the entire year. The stories are deep. The jokes are funny. The pacing are very well directed. The dynamic between characters are very charming. The morals behind are heartwarming.<br />
<br />
The final score is 6/10.

    I have a complicated relationship with this anime. I&#039;ve been watching it since it started and I&#039;ve laughed a lot. Chio can be pretty relate-able at times and seeing teen girls act like teen girls is nice. Her relationship with Mana, her best friend, makes me happy as well. It reminds me of myself and my best friend. Constantly antagonizing each other for fun but being there when it&#039;s important.<br />
<br />
The episodes with her helping out the ex-gang member are some of my favorite and I can never predict where it goes. <br />
<br />
But there are two main problems with this anime that keep me from loving

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287987">
        it. <br />
I say two because this is a seinen/ecchi so I&#039;m ignoring the highschool girl panty shots<br />
<br />
These problems are both a part of the original manga and aren&#039;t an anime exclusive problem.<br />
<br />
The first is pretty blatant homophobia. <br />
Now stick with me here.<br />
In the 3rd episode they introduce the president of their school&#039;s Kadabi club, Kushitori. She&#039;s a passionate and dedicated girl with a huge rack. Which isn&#039;t the problem. Kushitori is a lesbian. This in itself would be a good thing. More lesbians in anime is always a plus. <br />
But Kushitori is<br />
a &quot;predatory lesbian.&quot;<br />
<br />
An old and harmful trope that seems to shine in Kushitori. <br />
During a game of Kadabi, Chio reveals that she figured out Kushitori was a lesbian by watching her watch another female classmate. This would be fine but Kushitori&#039;s behavior towards girls gets worse and worse as the episodes continue. She constantly fantasizes about groping her classmates&#039; ass. And actually committing to the act despite the girls telling her to stop. It&#039;s really creepy and makes me, a bi woman, feel really bad.<br />
<br />
In a different instance the ex-gangster occasionally asks an ex-gang member for help. He ends up getting all blushy a few times and each time the gang leader responds with a horrified face.<br />
<br />
<br />
The second is pedophilia. I&#039;ll say it straight.<br />
The ex-gang leader and Chio have a pretty cute relationship the first few episodes they&#039;re in. She helps him get his life back on track and she thinks he&#039;s pretty cool. But in one of the later segments &quot;Flat Line&quot; I believe, we see inside his head and that his attempts to impress her earlier in the episode were all because he wants to strike up a conversation so he can ask her on a date. <br />
<br />
Chio is a highschool girl. He is a grown adult man in his late 20s-30s.<br />
<br />
Anyway those are the two things keeping me from really liking this series. <br />
Because of these things I don&#039;t think i&#039;ll recommend this to anyone.

    In case you haven&#039;t guessed from the title already, this show is about Chio Mayumi&#039;s daily adventures of going to school. Her over-active imagination and hardcore passion for playing games into the early hours of the morning, leads her into some very weird and hilarious situations as she meets various people along the way. Especially when she&#039;s with her friend Manana who&#039;s always looking for mischievous ways to mess around.<br />
<br />
I think that&#039;s all I can tell you without spoiling the jokes although each episode she makes two trips. They&#039;re not self-contained episodes as you&#039;ll see previous events carried over to the rest of the show.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299439">
        It has its own bit of fan service where female assets are given the odd bounce or flashing, groping etc but, it&#039;s aimed at the young male adult audience so it&#039;s pretty much a given. The odd episodes it can be really excessive...<br />
<br />
Some of the jokes also kind of go overboard, reminding me of the toilet humour from more mature Western cartoons like South Park which I didn&#039;t like but, most of the show is fun. If you like the kind of humour from Crayon Shin-chan like the prominent butt jabbing pranks or, if you play Western action video games you might be able to get into it because there&#039;s a lot of references in it. It&#039;s got a fun wrap-up too.<br />
<br />
And yup, &quot;Kabaddi&quot; is a real sport.

    I really wish I was giving this a more positive score because I actually really enjoyed this series! The characters were mostly lovely and have fun and creative interactions with each other, and I did really love how they captured the genuinely loving and yet back-stabbing relationship between Manana and Chio. The comedy too was very often successful for me - but the predatory lesbian character just bummed me out completely, and the panty shots are literally all over the place, and the girl with the crush on a teacher who is encouraged to confess her feelings is also a gross situation. I&#039;m also not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review379867">
        sure what the age gap is with Andou but I&#039;m gonna guess it&#039;s a weird and uncomfortable amount considering Chio is just 15. With all that, it just made a series that was supposed to be lighthearted wacky fun a real ew reminder about how sexualization of young girls is somehow supposed to be a turn-on.
