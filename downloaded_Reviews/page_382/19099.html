<meta name="description" content="Read reviews on the anime Pico to Chico on MyAnimeList, the internet&#039;s largest anime database. The crisp rays of summer sun find the effeminate Pico embroiled in yet another heated and lustful fling. While out biking, Pico meets and befriends Chico—a lively boy not much younger than him, but leagues behind in the affairs of the flesh. After the innocent Chico shows his sister in the midst of self-pleasure to Pico, Pico takes it upon himself to educate this confused youth. [Written by MAL Rewri..." />

    Well, this was a surprise.  From the various comments that I&#039;ve seen, I didn&#039;t have much expectations of this OVA after the experience that was Boku no Pico. In fact, I was expecting a mediocre work in comparison.  Thankfully, it seems that I was proven wrong.<br />
<br />
Pico to Chico is the second title of the renowned Pico trilogy and undoubtedly its turning point.  In this OVA, Pico, the protagonist, has his first encounter with Chico.  The story takes an interesting twist as it deals with Chico&#039;s experiences in learning about the human body and its pleasures, which many viewers could relate to.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review49301">
         Essentially, we witness the growth of an innocent boy who discovers a whole new world to explore.  It is a journey of exploration as well as self-discovery.  The events of this tale are presented with exquisite pacing and execution- each scene flows seamlessly to the next.  Although a conventional means of storytelling is used, especially with regards to the vanilla depictions of &quot;intimacy,&quot; it is exceptional in execution.  By the time the conclusion is reached, you will crave for more on the life of Pico and Chico. <br />
<br />
The arguably profound imagery and engaging dialogue from the first OVA are still present.  One example that really stood out to me was a toy near the beginning that took on a phallic shape, as if to foreshadow the events to come.  However, like the other images of this series, what I just said was just merely one interpretation of it.  I would mention more on the dialogue, but it may very well be a crucial spoiler.  I will say, however, that it is particularly gripping and will have no problems holding anyone&#039;s interest, dealing with topics such as servitude.  Each line is masterfully crafted to serve as a building block for the relationship between the two main characters. <br />
<br />
The art and animation are superb, with little to no changes from the first OVA.  The character designs for Chico and his sister are very appropriate for the tone of the work.  Backgrounds and scenery are presented with clarity, and are a sight to behold as well as to analyze.  The &quot;intimate&quot; scenes are fluid and delivered succinctly, ensuring that the main messages aren&#039;t missed. I found myself watching intently in order to appreciate the beauty of the visuals of these scenes, almost forgetting that there was much more than eye candy involved.  You can really tell that Natural High had a field day with this one.<br />
<br />
Sound is excellent, as usual.  The OP/ED, &quot;Natsuyasumi,&quot; is a catchy song that really fits the atmosphere of the OVA.  Voices are as they should be, and the characters&#039; personality really shine through when they speak (a bit more on that later).  The soundtrack works much like the song, but one important thing to keep in mind is how the tracks help emphasize innocence and intimacy.  Without them, important scenes wouldn&#039;t be as engrossing as they should be.<br />
<br />
What really makes this OVA stand out from the rest of the trilogy, however, are the characters.  Pico is still a protagonist shrouded in a bit of mystery, as we question his motives for meeting Chico and introducing to him another side of human nature.  Chico is developed extremely well, especially since the story focuses on his growth.  By the end of the episode, we can really see the changes he underwent from starting out as a curious and naive boy.  The relationship between Pico and Chico is also key here, as the chemistry between the two is just perfect.  Going back to dialogue and voices, we can see that each exchange offers some insight on their individual personalities, especially in regards to Chico and his childish demeanor.  A prominent example of this is the manner and context in which he says &quot;ochinchin.&quot;  The choice of this word suggests a youthful personality, and his tone helps to exemplify that.<br />
<br />
Some might argue that a flaw in character is Chico&#039;s sister.  She is just there and doesn&#039;t interfere with the boys&#039; relationship.  It could even be said that she is simply a character for unnecessary fanservice!  However, we must realize that Chico&#039;s sister serves as a catalyst- through her own character, she creates a foundation for the two boys to build on, sparking their curiosity and thus initiating the story with a boost in speed.<br />
<br />
What can I say?  This title is definitely something that I&#039;ll remember.  From the thematic exploration to the bonding relationships, the second title in the Pico trilogy has no issues with engaging the viewer.   Pico to Chico has many aspects that make it a truly &quot;interesting&quot; work.  This is definitely something that can be rewatched multiple times to firmly grasp every detail.  Still, it may be too &quot;excessive&quot; for some audiences, and that is quite unfortunate.  <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re still wondering whether or not Pico to Chico lives up as a successor to Boku no Pico- it does, perhaps even surpassing it.  I would strongly recommend this title to any aficionado that has watched Boku no Pico. Also, don&#039;t forget to check out the third title of this installment - Pico x Coco x Chico.   Without it, the tale of the Pico trilogy would be incomplete.

    While the first Boku no Pico OVA was a little disappointing, Pico to Chico was just plain dumb. <br />
There was hardly plot whatsoever. It was just just 30 minutes of pure sex scenes.  <br />
The characters were awful. They showed very little emotion. Not much information is told about them. They show no growth or development throughout they story.  <br />
So unless you want to see little boys make out for 30 minutes straight,  I would not recommend this anime.

    Why? Why did I have to give this abomination of a series another chance? If I couldn&#039;t get all the way through the first one, what the hell made me think I could finish this one?<br />
<br />
Never thought I&#039;d say this, but Pico to Chico is one thousand times creepier than Boku no Pico. I was ten seconds into the opening and my mouth was already hanging open in shock. Remind me: who the hell is supposed to enjoy this shit again? I&#039;ve always had a very open mind, but I&#039;m being serious here people. Why is this in any way pleasurable to ANYONE? I don&#039;t

    Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. The first one made me wash out my eyes (and penis) with soap for a whole four days. <br />
<br />
Fortunately this one... isn&#039;t as bad as Boku no Pico. Rather than a man and a she-boy, this story features not one, but two she-boys. The more the merrier. At least they both kind of look like girls. Kind of.<br />
<br />
By no means am I saying this anime is good. Trust me. It isn&#039;t. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m just saying I spent less time in the bathroom trying to cleanse myself.<br />
<br />
So by all means, watch this anime. Just make sure to watch it one day before you die

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186001">
        (so you don&#039;t have to spend as much time in the bathroom).<br />
<br />
Overall rating - 11/10 Masterpiece.  Don&#039;t just watch it once. Rewatch it for quality entertainment.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading!<br />
<br />
Yours truly, Awardo.<br />

    If you&#039;re into this sort of thing, then I guess that this would be the very definition of what you are looking for. A piece made with the target audience in mind, if you like shota, this is a 9. if you dont its a 3. I gave it a 6 because of the picture quality and bad interactions.

    Hoho. Since I just watched Boku no Pico I thought I should watch Pico to Chico, too. LOL.<br />
<br />
So we have Pico once again minus Mokkun from the first episode as to why I really don&#039;t know. Maybe Pico got tired of him (just trying to think logically here. I&#039;m trying my best xD). And then we have Chico, a boy younger that Pico and he was really cute. I really find him soooo cute. With his innocence and everything I almost want to scold Pico for doing lewd things with him. Tch. Oh, well I guess let&#039;s blame the Onee-chan here for being careless (I&#039;m

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175541">
        just really looking for someone to blame here. hihi. xD) You see, Chico saw his onee-chan doing some errr, ecchi stuff with herself and then shared this valuable info to Pico. And poof! We have naughty boys playing. LOL.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I like this better than Boku no Pico. Pico and Chico make a good couple than Pico and Mokkun would ever be (I&#039;m not really a fan of adults making out with kids). *sigh<br />
<br />
Since I knew what I&#039;m getting myself into when I watch this (having watched Boku no Pico) I&#039;m not that surprised. And so I was entertained again. Especially on how Chico took everything as if he was just playing his favorite game. xD<br />
<br />
So guys, for those who watched Boku no Pico, give Pico to Chico a try, too. That is if you want to go further and explore the dark side of yaoi. Hahaha.<br />
<br />
As for Pico. Well, see you next episode. LOL.

    In the Holy Trinity of what is known as the &#039;Boku no Pico Trilogy&#039; has it&#039;s second stop include an all new character to the mix, a boy named Chico. Now, everybody seems to be shocked by these OVAs, but all jokes aside - it&#039;s shota. If you&#039;re not into shota, then OF COURSE it&#039;d be weird. The first one&#039;s plot consisted of a guy having fun with Pico after he drops ice cream on his shirt and then it just escalated. Now, does the guy come back in the sequel? No.<br />
<br />
&#039;Pico to Chico&#039; does what it says on the tin. Pico finds Chico in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182928">
        the wilderness, swimming naked. Now, I&#039;m not one to bag on skinny dipping but this is clearly a reference to Pico doing the same thing in the first one. Chico and Pico then become good buddies, and starts to hang out. One of the things they show in the montage is them sleeping together, naked, on a tree. I sure as hell hope that tree doesn&#039;t have bugs crawling over or something like that because that&#039;s just nasty.<br />
<br />
The action truly begins when Chico spies on his sister doing... well, whatever women do with a banana. This clearly rings something wrong in terms of Chico&#039;s character, but it doesn&#039;t distract the fact that his sister was doing it with a banana. Aside from him peeping on his sister, with the only straight-oriented part of the whole show, Pico then gets anally-penetrated by Chico right then and there after Pico explains the process with his &#039;ochinchin.&#039; <br />
<br />
Afterwards they just continually bang until the 22 mark is reached. They do it in the farm house, they do it outside, and they do it in the house of course! However, that last one isn&#039;t vanilla by all means. For some reason, Chico&#039;s sister has clothes that fit both him AND Pico and doesn&#039;t lock her room properly as her cat-paw vibrator is taken by Pico. In the finale, both bang each other and that&#039;s about it. <br />
<br />
All in all, this OVA isn&#039;t worth of anything besides just shota porn. People who view the Boku no Pico OVAs as truly disgusting content and aren&#039;t very much into shota at all (i.e. the reaction people on YouTube) are OF COURSE going to be disgusted. Here, it&#039;s no different. It&#039;s just two kids banging. However wrong that maybe, it&#039;s fictional. I doubt any kids would skinny dip on their own without the intention to bang.

    Well Pico to Chico is the follow up to Boku No Pico. Not much has really changed from the original OVA as far style goes but it feels like less of an impact after you have seen the first one.<br />
<br />
Story 2/10<br />
There is really nothing I can make out of this one. The two kids Chico and Picoa re brought together after an encounter at  the lake and after spying on Chicos sister the have sexual endeavors. Not really much after that to take big notes about.<br />
<br />
Art 6/10<br />
Its the same style as the first, very realistic like. Still I am not the biggest fan of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review170265">
        the gay sex but hey if that is your thing you might enjoy the art style a little more than I did.<br />
<br />
Character 3/10<br />
This part still follows through like the first only containing three characters: Pico, Chico and Chico&#039;s Older Sister. One thing that really brings me down here is that the creators persist on giving the younger character feminine clothing and voices. It was a little more believable when it was just Pico but it just feels like overkill with two of them. Chico&#039;s sister appears to often pleasure herself and becomes the main reason why Chico and Pico experimented on themselves and at the end she finds out but does nothing about it. This really made me feel like the its getting a little unreal with itself and I think it would have been best to leave her out of the final scenes instead of making it even weirder than it is. This fact alone pulls down the character score a bunch and it gives me a lot of questions to ask.<br />
<br />
Sound 3/10<br />
While the theme in this one is less of a pain to my ears its still not great. If you really didn&#039;t like the first theme of Boku No Pico chances are you really won&#039;t like this one either.<br />
<br />
Overall 2/10<br />
The difference between this and the original is that if you watch the first it brings something new to the table but this one does not show any new qualities to be weirded out by that the first didn&#039;t already accomplish. More or less what different could the second one be compared to the first. I think if you watched the first there really isn&#039;t no harm in watching the second but hear me out it doesn&#039;t bring anything else thats worth noting about the first didn&#039;t already do.

    While watching pico to chico, multiple points came to mind with how it stacks up against the original Boku no Pico. Firstly i would like to point out that i dont understand why this had to be a sequel to boku no pico, as the only similarity it the character pico. This shota, to me, could have stood on its own without being a sequel and i think making it a sequel screws with the points of the original way to much. firstly in the original pico falls deeply in love with tamotsu, and it ends on a note of them wanting to be together,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review61827">
        so why would he want to form a sexual relationship with this new boy chico? but i digress, <br />
<br />
i would also like to point out that while the original had a much more story driven element to it, while this ova seemed to be more fanservice than anything. now im not saying this is bad necessarily, because the scenes in this movie are highly erotic and enjoyable as a whole, and i do enjoy raunchy hentai as well as story driven hentai. Im only bringing it up for the fact that, the original had themes in it that made it to me, probably the best shota anime in the field today. The themes of pico having gender based developmental identity disorder, and the psychological factors present in it make it much deeper than any old hentai. Even the main character tamotsu had dealt with some gender identity problems, albeit for a few seconds, once realizing that pico was indeed a boy and not a girl, BUT I DIGRESS,,,,,<br />
<br />
This is another point why i beleive pico to chico should have been its own series, as it is still very very good. but in a different way. also i enjoyed the setting of the scenes and how things played out as a whole. so i beleive goldenboy, (the company that had made both shota), knows how to appeal to their audience, but they shouldnt put characters in situations that dont make sense for them to be in for the sake of fanservice. <br />
<br />
overall this shota is probably the second best ive seen from goldenboy, the more i see from goldenboy the more i like what they&#039;re doing, so if your into shota you should give this a try, but the original is much better<br />
<br />

    Cross dressing Shotas having anal sex? Count me in! Pico &#039;n Chico: very sexy! This is one of those things I can&#039;t stop watching over and over! I find myself watching it three times in a day! This is a great anime for any hentai or shota fan! <br />
 What I liked most about this OVA was that it didn&#039;t have the dark atmosphere that most hentai have. There are no tentacles, no torture or any of the like. <br />
Instead, Pico &#039;n Chico has the more up-beat, lighthearted feel of a children&#039;s or Shoujo anime. But don&#039;t let that fool you-- this anime is for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review144335">
        adults only! <br />
 It is filled to the brim with graphic sex scenes!   There are frequent close-ups of the buttocks, anus, nipples and crudely censored genitals. I swear, I&#039;d be getting nosebleeds if I were an anime character. So, if it&#039;s Traps, Shota or Hentai you crave, look no further than Pico &#039;n Chico!

    Me: Well soldier?<br />

There are very few animes or even hentai that can make you sympathise with the douchebugs that are the Catholic Church. Unfortunately, this is one of them. After being pleasantly/sadly surprised by the good quality of the infamous first one, I did have hopes that the sequel would be a disappointment and therefore I could go back to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182889">
        old days where I could just laugh traps off and say I&#039;m only interested in lolis. Obviously god hates me though, so Natural High once again proved me wrong by releasing something that was even more twistingly good than the original.<br />
<br />
You see, apparently tempting young boys to sex is kind of like bullying. If you are bullied for a long time, then when you are finally free from the bullies you will start bullying someone yourself. It&#039;s like the old saying: &quot;If you stare long into the so-girly-you-can&#039;t-even-call-it-yaoi, the so-girly-you-can&#039;t-even-call-it-yaoi will stare back into you.&quot; Apparently the guy whose name you didn&#039;t even bother remembering from the first episode has plunged Pico so deeply into the yaoi chaos, that when Pico meets an EVEN YOUNGER boy, Chico, he wants to drag it to the yaoi subspace with him. Now if you considered the first one to be barely acceptable considering Pico is around 10 years old, I really don&#039;t want to hear your opinion regarding said 10 year old having sex with a boy I assume to be 6-7 years old. And here is where the magic happens. In the first Pico hentai you constantly had those bells dinging inside your head screaming: That&#039;s an adult man raping a gi... &quot;cough&quot; boy! Here, however, both of them are so clearly underage you just can&#039;t seem to get those bells dinging again.<br />
<br />
And here comes the second &quot;magic&quot; point of the episode. Exactly because there is no adult in that setting (minus a horny 20-something woman that you will questionably come to ignore in favor of the boys), or more specifically there is no adult £$%&amp;, your imagination can fit you in way easier into the setting than the first one. From this point alone it wins by default over the first one. Even better/worse, it is somehow way more lighthearted. While the first one had a tropical island setting that disturbingly reminded me of Dead Island, Pico to Chico focuses on a more mountainous setting that gives off a much more desolated feeling. And that actually imrpoves the situation, because you forget there is a world outside that little boy paradise/hell (...that sounded unbelievably wrong). + the relationship between two boys (?) has considerably less drama than that of a pedo and an underage boy. Not to mention that if I had to be in a trap hentai I would much rather be in a location where I wasn&#039;t in constant danger of dying from my own molotov.<br />
<br />
The sex is even kinkier than the first one, with various cosplays, constant role reversals and random woman masturbation shots adding a disturbingly appealing variety. The graphics are slightly worse than its predecessor&#039;s but the sound definitely takes tha cake, as now instead of one feminine sounding... Thing... You have two. In fact almost everything is better than the original, minus one thing. Seriously big sister onee-chan-something, I don&#039;t know how horny you are, but I&#039;m pretty sure when you catch your little brother doing... THAT, you should pay a bit more attention to his upbringing instead of jerking o... Oh, my bad, I confused the genders for a bit, silly me!<br />
<br />
Superior in every way to the original, which is real unfortunate considering it&#039;s 10 times more disturbing, at least the first one made it clear that the male guy was a pedo. Watch at your own risk.

    ((I reviewed this together with Baku no Pico and PicoXCocoXChico as well. This is the same review for all three.))<br />
<br />
 I think it’s rather cute in a way, but the fact it’s a little boy makes me feel a little dirty in a way. Now if we look at it from a way it not being Hentai, the artwork is astounding and really well done. <br />
<br />
The colors are pretty and bright giving it a childish look. The characters are nicely done and their proportions aren’t all that stretched out. <br />
I do have a small problem with the fact that Pico does not look like a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review65023">
        little child much. He looks older then he should and much taller. Another little problem is that the boys look like girls a lot. Not just how they sometimes dress up as girls but even in guys clothing, they look like girls.<br />
<br />
Voices are alright, and the sounds… sound believe able at least. I don’t want to get much into that area of the show thank you very much. <br />
<br />
Now… going into story line… At least this one has more of a story line then most other shows and uses it instead of making it a fuck all. I keep seeing it as a coming of age story or a exploration of the body though what they do is a little more then I would actually wish for. I know kids who are like them, that want to explore their bodies and see other peoples. In fact, when I was that age, I would always want to see my mother’s body because I was interested in how it differed from my own. I feel that Pico was touched by a pedophile and that’s why he acts the way he does with the other children. He sees it as a way to make friends and not really fully about full love. Now I can’t say there is not love in it but You can figure that if he is that young, he would be curious. The same goes for the cross dressing part of it as well. Wanting to know what it would feel like to be a girl instead of a guy. But really, that’s me getting into the philosophical part of a anime made for sexual reasons. That’s what happens when you try to break down a anime and review it, even with a hentai.

    I&#039;m sure if you&#039;re reading any review about this...&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;anime&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; you know what it&#039;s about. Pico to Chico, along with the first and last episodes in the series are one of THOSE. You know the one. Either you&#039;re watching it because you&#039;re a basement-dwelling pervert with a children&#039;s dungeon somewhere in your dank cave, or you&#039;re watching it because you know what you&#039;re about to get into and, although masochistic, you must watch it to not only satisfy your horribly morbid curiosity but also to satisfy your cynical view of the human race. There&#039;s no in-between. Coming from the views of someone in the latter category,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214102">
        here&#039;s my thoughts on this orgy of sin.<br />
<br />
Story: 1<br />
<br />
Allow me to start by saying if I could have given Pico to Chico a negative score, I would have. &#039;Appalling&#039; is a complete understatement, not just for this category, but for all of them. Not that anyone should expect one, but there was NO story. If you read the synopsis at the top of the page, that&#039;s it. Pico meets a boy named Chico, Chico for...whatever reason feels it meaningful to show Pico his sister pleasuring herself (SPOILERS: with a banana), and from there Pico and Chico&#039;s *ahem* excursions begin. And by excursions I mean thirty minutes of boy penis, boy penis in mouth, boy penis in asshole, just asshole, and a human centipede type scene in which boy shoves (cat paw??) vibrator up ass then shoves penis in other boy&#039;s asshole.<br />
<br />
Art: 1<br />
<br />
The art&#039;s not necessarily bad...it&#039;s just USED for bad. Like a superhero with a power he could be using for justice, but decides it would be better expended on destroying a city. Again, thirty minutes of cock shot and also cock shot.<br />
<br />
Sound: 1<br />
<br />
Imagine that 1 with a negative in front...as well as two zeros behind. I turned it off half-way through. When 9/10 of the show consists of two boys making o-faces, I don&#039;t need audio to know what I would be hearing.<br />
<br />
Character: 1<br />
<br />
What character? I saw more blurry, tiny cock and balls than character. Next.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1<br />
<br />
This show doesn&#039;t exist for enjoyment. Not for the normal citizen. Rather, it exists to sap enjoyment. This is what interrogators use to pry the deepest, darkest secrets out of hardened criminals.<br />
<br />
Overall: 1<br />
<br />
Want to spend the day washing yourself in acid while chugging bleach? Want to spend sleepless nights pondering to yourself exactly how far humans can fall on the moral ladder? Watch this. If you&#039;re not too traumatised after, congrats. You&#039;ve earned an imaginary badge of honour only a few brave souls have claimed.

Pico<br />
Pico (ぴこ, Piko)<br />
Voiced by: Mariko Sakou<br />
A blonde-haired boy who works a part time job at his grandfather&#039;s bar in the summer. He&#039;s often shown swimming, usually naked or in a blue Speedo. He has worn girls&#039; clothes ever since Tamotsu (Mokkun) gave some to him as a gift. Later, feeling hurt that Tamotsu wouldn&#039;t define their relationship, he rebels by cutting his hair and running away from home, although later on they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review385518">
        reconcile. The following summer, Pico meets Chico, who is swimming naked in a stream, while riding his bike. He soon becomes friends with Chico, who calls him &quot;Oniichan&quot; (big brother), and they form a romantic and sexual relationship. In his relationships with both Mokkun and Chico, he is the uke, though in the latter relationship this is somewhat reversible.<br />
Tamotsu<br />
Tamotsu (タモツ), also known as Mokkun, is a white-collar worker and regular at Bebe.[3] He seduces Pico after mistaking him for a young girl, but continues the relationship after discovering Pico is in fact male. He later buys Pico a girl&#039;s outfit, complete with a ruby choker and panties, which he persuades Pico to wear despite his initial protests. He views Pico solely as a sexual object, though later shows true concern for Pico after he disappears. Although he eventually reconciles with Pico, he is absent in the second and third OVAs. In his relationship with Pico, he is the seme.<br />
Ojiisan<br />
Ojiisan (おじいさん) is Pico&#039;s grandfather who runs a large but usually empty bar by the beach named Bebe. When Tamotsu visits him for the summer, he has Pico help out as waiter, which involves wearing a frilly pink apron. He introduces Pico to Tamotsu and suggests they spend time together.<br />
Chico<br />
Chico (ちこ, Chiko)<br />
Voiced by: Aiko Ōkubo<br />
A brunette boy who lives with his older sister in a large house in a secluded forest area and develops a sexual relationship with Pico in the second episode. He is younger and less sexually experienced than Pico. He often plays in the outdoors nude and secretly watches Oneesan masturbate. In most cases, Chico is the seme, despite his age, though his relationship with Pico is somewhat reversible.<br />
Oneesan<br />
Oneesan (お姉さん) is Chico&#039;s older sister and legal guardian. Perhaps because of her caring for Chico, and her isolated home in the countryside, she appears sexually frustrated and masturbates regularly. After being caught masturbating by the boys through a crack in her bedroom ceiling, she becomes the indirect cause of their experimentation. She has a large collection of cosplay outfits and sex toys that Pico and Chico use without her permission. She later fondles herself away from the boys when she finds them sexually engaged upon returning home from the grocery store.<br />
CoCo<br />
Coco (ここ, Koko) is a feminine-looking boy with long, black hair who Pico and Chico meet in the third episode. It is subtly implied that Coco is actually a so-called &quot;city fairy&quot;, due to some strange minor occurrences in his vicinity, though this is never explicitly confirmed. Coco soon has sexual relationships with both Pico and Chico. After inadvertently causing some friction in their relationship, Coco decides to distance himself from Pico and Chico, though they do reunite with him at Tokyo Tower and end up having a threesome. He is also the main uke of the three, but this can be reversed.<br />

    Boku no Pico was a watershed moment in anime meme history, it became one of the go-to *wink**wink* anime recommendation choices when trolling your friends. Pico to Chico aims to capture the magic which made that show so popular by trying to chip away at our morality even more than before in this new installment of the Pico series. While there were certain techniques, I used to combat the fact that I was fapping to yaoi child porn landing me a list on the FBI’s watch list, it most certainly failed this time to keep my pride intact. While Pico to Chico gives you everything

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337930">
        you expected out of a Boku no Pico sequel, in certain storytelling aspects it does not quite live up to the original and the same goes for certain character dynamics.<br />
Story : 7<br />
What makes the Pico so unique, in my opinion, is that there is a certain level of quality that the stories keep which keep the viewer engaged. Most name brand hentai rarely give you much of a reason why our main characters are having sex in the first place, filling massive amounts of the hentai with uninteresting banging which we’ve all seen a hundred times over prompting us to skip through the video, quickly finish our business and move along. The Pico series strives to properly storyboard and pace their plot, slowing and speeding up the plot to keep the viewer watching and not skipping ahead. The plot is a central part of what makes the series so good and yet the introduction is squandered in this second installation with barely any scenes dedicated to explaining how Pico ended up there, brushing it off as mere coincidence while in the original we were given time to breath as we saw Pico engaging with Tamotsu in a friendly relationship that explained them going deeper. Although the introduction falls flat, the rest of the series picks up with similar pacing where they edge the viewer along by providing whispers of what was promised while filling the spaces with Pico and Chico playing around showing us how their relationship builds and it all culminates in an ending which while satisfying does not reach the quality of Boku no Pico with it’s character arcs and nuanced conflict.<br />
Art : 7<br />
Keeping in the theme of adequacy, Pico to Chico maintains the artistic and animation quality we received from the original and for a 2000s hentai it holds up well today.<br />
<br />
Characters : 7<br />
By far the greatest aspect of this show reminds me of the original in it’s characters. For fans of the original, we are payed off in seeing how the previous relationship has affected Pico’s sexual nature from a timid young girl to a more confident and dominant force while first time viewers will still subtly pick up on the nature of Pico leading towards the first scenes that establish her outgoing nature and confirming it when she makes her move. Chico, on the other hand, reflects our lost childlike innocence we once had before being pulled into degeneracy by hentai and we see his descent into darkness throughout the show. What’s most engaging is the role reversal witnessed, how Pico takes Tamotsu’s place in the relationship guiding and teaching innocent Chico who acts the way Pico did when she first met Tamotsu. Chico evolves from timid to confident much like how Pico has and this cycle of sexual information being passed from Tamotsu to Pico and now Pico to Chico is seen coming full circle towards the end of the episode. One of my main issues with the show is Manko, Chico’s older sister, who plays a sideline bystander role in the series which feels like lost potential to me. Manko feels like an afterthought of a character, more like a prop than a living entity in the show, completely untouched from start to finish which brings about the more ‘hollow’ feeling Pico to Chico has compared to Boku no Pico.<br />
Moral Toll : 9<br />
I’ve seen the vore, the rape, the electrocution and the diaper humiliation. I haven’t seen it all but I’ve seen enough for hentai to have torn a good chunk out of my morality and yet Pico to Chico took more out of me than I’ve felt in a long while. My mantra which kept me whole during my viewing of Boku no Pico was ‘Pico is a girl, a chick with a dick’ because she did look like a girl and she was voiced by a female VA. ‘This is fine, it’s futa not yaoi’ I said to myself and this failed me when I watched Pico to Chico. Pico has taken such a dominant role in the series that it’s impossible to ignore that she is a he and the show mocks you by showing glimpses that Pico is a girl and Chico is a boy, but those glimpses are far and few between. At the end of the day, dread it, run from it, the realization you’re watching yaoi child porn arrives all the same.<br />
Pico to Chico did not nearly have as much engagement out of the that Boku no Pico had. There is no conflict which drove the plot meaning there was little plot in general, compared to Boku no Pico which was a story, I would describe Pico to Chico as a character study of two individuals while the creepy older sister peeped from the closet and watched. I definitely did not enjoy this as much as Boku no Pico and it took too much of a toll on me, much more than I expected. If you can get over that mental hurdle, be my guest and fap to Pico to Chico but for the rest of the virgin unhardened hentai viewers steer clear of this one.<br />

    This was...bad. I honestly don&#039;t understand how some of this shit makes it out of Japan. I&#039;ll say it only once. Don&#039;t watch this shit.Oh, and since I know you will anyway just be prepared to have the most limp dick you could possibly imagine(unless you&#039;re into that shit). I don&#039;t understand why someone would even make this. There is art and expression, and then there is Pico to Chico. I mean is this supposed to be fan service?!? I&#039;d hope not considering that for the average person little boys fucking each other shouldn&#039;t be arousing. &quot;Every day we stray farther from god.&quot; Never have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277432">
        I believed in that quote more then after watching this shit pile of an OVA. It was recommended to me by a &quot;friend&quot;. Never again shall I watch an anime without thoroughly looking into the reviews. The only reason I finished it was because I&#039;m an idiot. God be with you on this shit brothers.

    They made another one. Somehow these bastards got this approved for a second round. I survived the last torture session, and I got through this too. However, does Pico to Chico improve on actual storytelling elements unlike it&#039;s predecessor, or does it delve farther into the rabbit hole? Today, that is what I decide, and hopefully something good comes out of this conglomeration.<br />
<br />
Story: 1/Pathetic<br />
Let me just say before anything else, they didn&#039;t improve. It...got...worse. I don&#039;t how, but it did. Pico to Chico takes all the scraps of story that Boku no Pico thought it had, and shredded them further. The episode is the same

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242408">
        length, and, unsurprisingly, includes the same sexual content. It starts with Pico biking through the forest, when he suddenly finds Chico, and younger boy, playing in a river. Chico invites Pico to stay at his house and hang out with him for the day, becoming new friends and all. The problem with this situation however is that not a single character besides Pico is present from the previous episode. Tamotsu, Pico&#039;s previous lover, is nowhere to be found. This opens up a whole slew of other theories and questions about what happened to the both of them between then and now. After this, Pico comes over, and from then on it is basically the same progression of plot we saw the last time: sex. That start is the only development made in the narrative, and the rest of the time, it is simply Pico having vigorous intercourse with another male. Besides the one part with the sister who masterbates, that was pretty nice.<br />
<br />
Art: 1/Pathetic<br />
Same art as last time, bland, poor, and saturated. Nothing more to say than that. Sometimes it seems that the animators weren&#039;t even trying, which they probably weren&#039;t. Effort was not put into color selection or animation this time around, whatsoever. Unsurprisingly, the art of this episode was as bad as the last.<br />
<br />
Sound: 2/Dreadful<br />
Another aspect that the producers and directors failed in more than the last time, sound is dreadful. The opening is not recognizable like last time, honestly I can&#039;t remember a single verse of the theme to this show. The ambience also feels empty and lacking, with tracks sounding like they were just recycled from the last episode. Music is a portion of anime that must have as much work put into it as animation has. The creators obviously have not learned this simple rule of production, not matter if it is anime or other cartoons of the same nature.<br />
<br />
Character: 1/Dreadful<br />
They even made the characters worse. The lifelessness of the previous three I thought could only get better. It hasn&#039;t, with Chico assuming Pico&#039;s ignorant stance to the situation of relationships and intercourse, and Pico becomes Tamotsu, the overbearing boyfriend. It is the same formula, only different bodies. A slight difference with Chico is that he is slightly more inclined to question Pico, but only at the start. Eventually they both are basically the same character, only with different hair and eyes. Chico&#039;s sister is a shell of human emotion, with no evolution, besides masturbating to a small boy penetrating her brother. There are no excuses to how bad these three are, none.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2/Dreadful<br />
Besides the girl masturbating in the middle of the episode, this is worthless. I would have rather skipped this and moved on to the final bullet in the revolver: Pico x CoCo x Chico. This episode is the most worthless of the 3, and I just wasted time. The devolution of this series is less disappointing, but more unsurprising. At these moments, I question why I have the drive to review such a trolly show. My motives may be questionable, but my purpose is to give out truthful windows into your mind if you witness these anime. I try my hardest, even if the creators don&#039;t. Luckily there is only one of these left, and maybe, just maybe, the best will be saved for last.

    Now Pico to Chico is a trilogy to the Boku no Pico Ova. I gave the story a 5 ecause really I dont get it it basically has hardly a plot and most of the scenes are filled with hentai (though theyre supposed to since its a hentai)<br />
<br />
The art and sound are amazing as usual showing the creators put of lot of work in this and the *certain*scenes are actuly vivid and flawless.<br />
<br />
The characters were given an 8 because the 2 characters of the mom and the sister are not really needed except the sister just instagates the boys to indulge in pleasure but shes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233615">
        mostly just there so is the mom.<br />
I had a fair enjoyment of this even though im not THAT intrested in this stuff but overall it was a 7/10 because it was pretty good.^ ^

    Pico to Chico is an OVA by Sugar Boy and Blue Cat.  It serves as a sequel to the infamous Boku no Pico, an OVA which I felt got a lot of undeserved hate.  Pico to Chico is similar to it&#039;s predecessor, but it&#039;s also noticeably different.  <br />
<br />
There&#039;s an unspoken rule when it comes to sequels.  A sequel should be as good, if not better, than it&#039;s predecessor.  If it isn&#039;t, then it has failed as a sequel.  That doesn&#039;t necessarily mean it&#039;s bad, just that it&#039;s dissapointing.  And Pico to Chico certainly fails as a sequel. 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322787">
        <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the story, which I suppose is the weakest part of this OVA.  The story (or lack there of) follows Pico during his summer.  It&#039;s not made clear if this takes place during the same summer as the first OVA, or if it&#039;s the following summer.  Curiously, Pico seems to be alone.  As neither his deadbeat grandfather, nor his lover Tamotsu, are present.  Instead, Pico comes across a young boy named Chico, in a sequence that mirrors how Tamotsu found Pico in the first OVA.  The two quickly become friends, and Chico takes Pico to his home.  At this point in my viewing I was still pretty positive, but that quickly changed.<br />
<br />
Pico and Chico spy on Chico&#039;s older sister as she masturbates with a banana.  What is it with this series and food!?  Anyway, Pico persuades Chico to do some... explicit things with him, in a sequence I felt was very creepy.  I&#039;d like to talk about this a bit.  Now, in the first OVA Pico was having sex with a much older man, Tamotsu.  That should be creepy, right?  Yeah, but I&#039;ve probably been to desensitized to feel anything.  Yet, when I watched this OVA, it felt very creepy.  Why?  Why this one and not the previous one?  Well, I think I may have figured it out.<br />
<br />
In the first OVA Tamotsu did things to Pico, however, the Ice Cream scene was the only time Pico didn&#039;t explicitly give him permission.  However, Pico never rejected his advances or acted surprised/curious.  Tamotsu wasn&#039;t convincing Pico to do anything, they just did things together.  No questions asked.  But with Pico and Chico, things are a little different.  Pico actively suggests Chico do sexual things with him.  And unlike Pico with Tamotsu, Chico doesn&#039;t just go along, he&#039;s a little unsure.  I think this is what makes it creepy.  The way Pico suggested to Chico that they have sex, and the way Pico convinced him to do it.  Things didn&#039;t just happen with both parties giving their silent consent, there was hesitation, and manipulation.  It doesn&#039;t help that Chico is obviously a very young child, and not a tween like Pico.<br />
<br />
Anyways, back on track.  There isn&#039;t a whole lot to the &quot;story&quot; besides that.  Unlike the previous OVA, which tried to add some drama (it was terrible drama, but at least they tried), the rest of this OVA mainly consists of Pico and Chico having steamy yaoi sex.  What else would you expect?<br />
<br />
The art is... ehh...  It&#039;s not bad, but it&#039;s clearly inferior to the art in the previous OVA.  It just doesn&#039;t look as high quality, so I&#039;m guessing there must&#039;ve been a lower budget or something.  Still better than most hentai at the time though.  There was also this really annoying lighting effect.  Everything looked so bright, I felt like I needed sunglasses.  I get that it&#039;s supposed to be summer, but that doesn&#039;t mean you have to crank the brightness up and add in a bunch of rays.  What were they thinking!?<br />
<br />
The voice acting is fine.  I don&#039;t speak Japanese, so I won&#039;t comment on it to much.  I liked the opening song, but I think I still prefer the one from the first OVA. <br />
<br />
Now, how about the characters?  Well, normally I&#039;d look at each individually, but I don&#039;t have a whole lot to say, since there&#039;s not a whole lot to them.  This OVA stars the titular Pico, who&#039;s still cute and fun, but his personality is a little different.  He&#039;s more assertive and controlling, and he acts more mature.  Although, he is still somewhat cautious.  Then there&#039;s Chico.  He&#039;s cute and innocent (until Pico came around that is), and he&#039;s also very friendly.  He doesn&#039;t let Pico push him around all the time, and sometimes he&#039;s the one that decides to do something.  There&#039;s also Chico&#039;s sister, but she&#039;s basically a non-presence in the story, so I don&#039;t have anything to say about her.<br />
<br />
All in all I have... um... I don&#039;t really know how I feel about this OVA.  I&#039;d normally say I have mixed views... but I don&#039;t.  This OVA is mediocre in basically every aspect.  I didn&#039;t dislike it, but I&#039;m not sure I liked it either.  It&#039;s not good or bad, it&#039;s just... neutral.  Pico to Chico had an opportunity to be a decent sequel to it&#039;s predecessor, but it ultimately failed to do that.  It lacks the qualities that made Boku no Pico good, it fails to do anything better, and often does them worse.  But if it&#039;s any condolence, I guess I don&#039;t regret spending my time watching this.  5.5/10<br />
<br />
Would I reccomend you watch Pico to Chico?  Ehh... I guess?  If you really like yaoi then sure.  But if you don&#039;t, and you just happened to like the first OVA for another reason, it might be best to temper your expectations.

    So we&#039;ve come to the second &quot;episode,&quot; the &quot;sequel?&quot; Well, what can I say about this? Um, basically in this one, Pico meets a younger boy named Chico and he teaches him about his body, the joys of sex, and oh, they spy on Chico&#039;s older sister while she masturbates. Yep! Honestly though the story is... a bit better but a little more disturbing than the first anime. Why? Because Pico is preying on little kids, like Chico looks ten or something. IDK. We do get to see Chico and Pico bonding and stuff, which defines and fleshes out their relationship a little bit but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review355870">
        my need for continuity from the first episode is making me ask the question: Where is Tamotsu and what happened to him? My answer? He went back to the city! <br />
<br />
Sorry for the sarcasm... This is kinda unbearable to get through.<br />
<br />
Again the art is the strongest point of this sequel and Pico and Chico are the best designed characters. And there was, again, some pretty scenery.<br />
<br />
The voice acting, the music, eh everything was okay. I&#039;m still not a fan of the ending and opening songs.<br />
<br />
The characters are kinda better because we do see Pico and Chico bonding BUT at the end of the day this is still a Hentai and that means the characters aren&#039;t developed like you would see in your normal anime.<br />
<br />
Again, my enjoyment is very low for this one. I enjoyed some pretty scenery, i enjoyed that Pico and Chico got to bond with each other but everything was just bland.This does get some extra points for at least developing Chico and Pico a bit. <br />
<br />
Overall, I don&#039;t really recommend this unless you like boy love animes or like hentais in general.
