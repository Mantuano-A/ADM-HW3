    Maybe it’s because I’m getting old and senile, but it seems that the more anime I watch, the less sense they seem to make. You could imagine my confusion when I started watching Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? &quot;Why is the zombie weak to sunlight but not the vampire? Why the hell is he in a pink frilly dress? Why is that monster a giant lobster?&quot; In exasperation, I put these questions to a good friend, and I found that his reply turn out to be a very apt one-sentence summary for my review.<br />
<br />
He said to me: &quot;I dunno lol, who cares? It&#039;s fucking hilarious!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everything

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35508">
        in Kore wa Zombie Desu ka, from story to character to humor, is based on complete outrageousness. I hesitate to call Kore wa Zombie~ an original anime, because it&#039;s seems that Kore wa Zombie~&#039;s idea of originality is to take as many ideas as possible, exaggerate them to the absolute maximum limit of the imagination, and then cram them together into a single, epic anime.<br />
<br />
So exactly is it that I mean when I say outrageousness? Let&#039;s pretend that there are 2 &#039;idea guys&#039; who started working on the story for this, whom I will dub them Jim and Bob. (Warning, minor spoilers)<br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#039;s an idea!&quot; says Jim. &quot;Let&#039;s make the main protagonist a zombie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great idea!&quot; replies Bob. &quot;We&#039;ll have an utterly immortal zombie who constantly gets humorously dismembered, baked like a potato chip when he stands in the sun, and receives magical powers that turns him into a pink cross-dressing/chainsaw wielding mas(h)ou shoujo(nen).&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome,&quot; nods Jim with approval, &quot;and since this is a harem, we need at least one tsundere character.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; replies Bob again, &quot;we&#039;ll have a pseudo-sadistic tsun~ ninja girl with a ridiculously named fighting technique that uses cellulose (leaves), cooks up acid pots, and plays the violin in a maid orchestra.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#039;s make her a vampire as well.&quot; adds Jim.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why the heck not,&quot; laughs Bob, giving Jim a high-five.<br />
<br />
... and you get the idea.<br />
<br />
What is most surprising about Kore wa Zombie~ despite having so many wild concepts crammed in, it somehow still manages to tie it all into a very neat comical package. Normally you&#039;d expect something so slapstick-heavy to comprise it&#039;s plot and characters, but Kore wa Zombie~ manages to seamlessly incorporate all it&#039;s content into an (almost) coherent and flowing story.<br />
<br />
The characters in Kore wa Zombie~ are all, well, ridiculous. I mean one of them literally has like, 10 different voice actors. And she doesn&#039;t talk! (try getting your head around that one). Needless to say, all the characters are very &#039;interesting&#039; and their backstories relatively well thought out and presented. There is the exception of the protagonist&#039;s human friend cuz, he&#039;s well... y&#039;know, normal. Kore wa Zombie~ is a harem of course, so there is the usual male lead and his entourage of female companions. What is great though is that unlike many harem (to Love-Ru for instance) that focuses on the protagonist&#039;s perverse interactions with the females, Kore wa Zombie~ instead chooses to emphasize building the relationship between the male lead and his companions, which I thought was a nice change of pace.<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t exactly call Kore wa Zombie&#039;s story solid, the plot itself isn&#039;t exactly complex; there are various backstories which were left untouched and minor plot hole issues. As far as harem-type story goes however, Kore wa Zombie&#039;s plot is definitely up there in with the rest. The interesting aspect of Kore wa Zombie~&#039;s story isn&#039;t WHAT is happening, but HOW it&#039;s happening, and I found that with Kore wa Zombie~’s almost surrealistic approach, I was caring about the actual plot a lot less that I normally would have, because I was too distracted that ridiculously hilarious thing that just happened.<br />
<br />
Another thing is the art. While Kore wa Kore~&#039;s animation quality is nothing too spectacular, the action scenes are unique in that they contain a very interesting combination of a dark tone, spectacle, gore, and an excess of pink. Yeah don&#039;t think too hard on that one. The OP is also surprisingly well done, and it almost makes me sad that they couldn&#039;t maintain the same level of quality throughout the entire episode.<br />
<br />
The only gripe I have with this anime is due to it&#039;s comical nature, there are various moments when supposedly serious scenes are ruined because they took the humor a little bit too far. To give one example (spoiler alert), in the final moments of the main antagonist&#039;s death, as he lies dying in the arms of his necromancer, he looks into her eyes in a touching scene, and he says:<br />
<br />
&quot;If I die, make me a penguin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hahaha... No wait. Seriously?<br />
<br />
This really isn&#039;t a major issue, but I was disappointed in the show slight deficiency in real consequential, solemn scenes which didn&#039;t involve some sort of joke tacked on the end. It made the anime feel a little bit one sided and narrow, and prevented me from giving it a higher score. One thing to mention though. They actually bothered air another episode after the &#039;big climatic battle&#039;. I literally can&#039;t count the number of times I&#039;ve watched anime that seemed to think that a 3 minute epilogue was sufficient in ending the story after the big boss goes down. Kore wa Zombie~ actually took the effort to give some rarely found closure to the story. Thank god.<br />
<br />
Kore wa Zombie~ is a rather unique anime, perhaps something you&#039;d expect if you crossed J.C. Staff with SHAFT. It definitely won&#039;t win any awards and it&#039;s not exactly thought provoking, but it easily makes up for it in sheer ridiculousness and outrage. So why should you watch Kore wa Zombie desu ka? <br />
<br />
I dunno lol, who cares? It&#039;s fucking hilarious!

    Is everything really better with zombies?<br />
<br />
Given the recent surge in stories involving the shambling undead it&#039;s pretty obvious that there are people out there who believe that they can improve any form of entertainment, so much so that at times it seems as though the world is already in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. Tales of creatures that wander aimlessly, groan a lot, and have the annoying habit of eating people while they&#039;re still alive are rife in movies and games (although I tend to class Resident Evil as more of a playable soap opera with added undead), but that&#039;s only the tip of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37176">
        the iceberg. Zombies are now appearing on prime time TV (The Walking Dead), and even literary works have fallen foul of them (Pride &amp; Prejudice &amp; Zombies).<br />
<br />
Of course, anime and manga are no strangers to stories of the undead, and while there are some interesting takes on the theme (and before you ask, no, the adolescent wet dream that is Highschool Of The Dead isn&#039;t one of them), the majority of titles on offer follow the George A. Romero method and offer up a healthy dose of body shock. While there are stories like Zombie Loan that try to do things differently, these are often lacklustre affairs that are more drama than actual horror.<br />
<br />
And then there are shows like Kore wa Zombie Desu ka (Is This A Zombie)?<br />
<br />
Originally a popular light novel series by Kimura Shinichi (which has also spawned three different manga that are set in the world of the story), the anime adaptation follows the life of Ayumu Aikawa, a highschool student who was murdered by a serial killer. He was quickly resurrected as a zombie by the necromancer Eucliwood Hellscythe, and since that time he has tried to make the best of a bad situation. His life now consists of everyday mundanity (barring an inability to tolerate the sun and avoiding fire hazards), as he lives in relative peace with his silent saviour, but all that changes when he meets the young, chainsaw wielding masou shoujo in training called Haruna (and no, that&#039;s not a spelling mistake).<br />
<br />
After that his life takes a turn for the worse.<br />
<br />
Okay, it all sounds pretty intriguing, but that&#039;s as far as it goes. The plot features some interesting tokens that work well with one or more of the themes in KoreZom, but the series composition has been poorly executed, so much so that viewers may find themselves wondering if there&#039;s any point to the show. The main problem is that there&#039;s simply too much going on, and because of this the storyline is so disjointed it can sometimes seem like the narrative is being held together with some glue and a couple of nails, and that&#039;s not the worst part.<br />
<br />
KoreZom attempts to parody some well known genres, and initially it may manage to raise a few laughs with its approach, but this quickly becomes tiresome as the series attempts to turn them into running gags. In addition to this the idea of putting all of the protagonists under one roof has only been done for those stereotypical comedy moments that are amusing to those with more teeth than braincells, which is a shame as there are a few hints of how funny the show could have been. The storyline appears to be desperately trying to reach for ... something, but what it is and how it could be achieved are things that only the producers may know.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the shoddy workmanship continues into the visuals where generic design seems to be the order of the day. Aside from the outfits, KoreZom features some truly unremarkable looking characters, all of whom look like they were copied directly from other harem based shows. That said, Studio DEEN are only partly to blame for this as the main inspiration came from the light novel&#039;s illustrations by Kobuichi and Muririn, which is a tad unfortunate as if the rest of the artwork is anything to go by, the series would have been better served with the producers creating everything from scratch. While the scenery and settings may sometimes be generic, they can also be atmospheric and detailed, and there&#039;s a variety to the imagery that highlights the difference in creative mentalities. Granted the character design may have been an attempt to support the parodying of specific genres, but that&#039;s no excuse for the obvious lack of originality or innovation.<br />
<br />
Which brings up the issue of fanservice.<br />
<br />
When a show has a transparently weak foundation there are many ways to bolster the viewer&#039;s opinion of it, but the one that takes the least effort follows the simple ethos that &quot;sex sells&quot;. Now somebody on the production team obviously realised very early on that KoreZom was a shaky proposition so not only is the fanservice aggressively blatant, it often feels more like a slap in the face.<br />
<br />
I mean seriously, is there any need for all those close ups during the fights? This is supposed to be a comedy, not Ikkitousen or Queen&#039;s Blade.<br />
<br />
Aside from the background imagery, the only other good point about the visuals is the animation, most of which is of a decent standard. There are a few blips here and there, some of which are purposeful to highlight certain comedic aspects while  others simply slipped through the net, but these can be forgiven in light of the major problems this series has.<br />
<br />
The opening sequence features a rather dramatic array of imagery depicting the main characters in various &quot;thoughtful&quot; poses before adding some action sequences to highlight their combat skills, all set to the song Leave-It-To-Me-Tonight by Nomizu Iori. Unlike the OP, the ending sequence is more true to the predominantly humourous tone of the series, and features the track Realize, Mr. Zombie, I Am Your Classmate by Rie Yamaguchi and Manzo. As for the background music, KoreZom has a nice variety of well choreographed accompaniments, but the truth is that a few of them are unnecessary as they don&#039;t really add much to the scene and seem like nothing more than another support for a weak storyline.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, especially given all of the production issues, the acting is actually pretty decent. The script is fairly mediocre as it follows an age old comedy format (so repetitive phrases abound), which isn&#039;t really the best thing for the serious moments in the show as it can be difficult to make the mental switch between humour and action - and this shows in several places. Thankfully the seiyuu are on hand to save the day, so what could have been very flat comedy routines gain some life and the more emotive scenes are provided with much needed personality. Unfortunately the actors are only human, so even though they do their best with the script, there&#039;s simply not enough viable content to support or develop their roles.<br />
<br />
Now given that KoreZom is supposed to be a parody of sorts it should be the case that characterisation is all that&#039;s needed to make the series work, so it&#039;s a little disappointing that the characters are nothing more than shallow copies based upon one or more archetypes that are generally found in harem romantic comedies. Aikawa is the typical clueless lead male with few future prospects who is suddenly surrounded by females who apparently like necrophilia (he&#039;s a zombie, remember?), and after his introduction viewers can engage in a spot of ornithology (bird watching).<br />
<br />
Oh look! There&#039;s the Greater Spotted Tsundere Loli, and over there is the Large Breasted Warrior trying not to look embarrassed, and in front of the TV you can see the Silver Haired Silent Warbler waiting to be entertained.<br />
<br />
Yes, KoreZom has a wealth of common character types that will keep any harem junkie entertained for five minutes, and the best thing about all of them is that viewers will never once believe that they could ever be real, so feeble is their characterisation and development.<br />
<br />
So is there actually anything good about this series?<br />
<br />
Well ... actually there are a few bits worthy of praise, and if one discounts the generally banal and inane humour then KoreZom has a few morsels to offer. There are some genuinely funny moments that are both surprising and well executed, and the while the initial parody of the mahou shouko genre is pretty bog standard, the second one actually refutes the idea that Puella Magi Madoka★Magica was in any way genre breaking.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the comedy can only carry the show so far, and the simple fact is that KoreZom simply doesn&#039;t know what it&#039;s supposed to be, so it winds up being nothing in particular. It&#039;s a shame really as the seeds are there for this to have been either an interesting supernatural tale, or a very good parody (if one removes the unnecessary fanservice), and it&#039;s nice to see a different take on zombies once again.<br />
<br />
The sad fact is that the traditional zombie is now almost extinct in entertainment media, and those that remain are treated as rare relics of the original belief that a person could be magically raised from the dead in order to complete tasks like carrying the shopping, painting the house, etc, etc. These old style zombies from West Africa and Haiti are usually a far cry from the modern take, often being better groomed, able to speak, and capable of following simple orders.<br />
<br />
Actually, they sound a lot like husbands.

    HOLY CRAP ANOTHER ZOMBIE ANIME!<br />
<br />
Hey wait a minute.. Aren&#039;t zombies suppose to be the living dead with rotting flesh and mindless expressions, mumbling &quot;braaaainnnnssss....&quot; <br />
No wait, that&#039;s my biology lecturer...<br />
<br />
Anyways, sure Aikawa Ayumu looks like a normal typical high school boy with a boring life etc etc, but isn&#039;t that how all the typical animes started out with?<br />
However, he is blessed with a special gift... No! Not a harem! Im talking about his gift of being the walking undead! (And for added fun, the ability to crossplay!)<br />
<br />
The anime started out pretty normal but just less then a minute everything turns haywire as his identity of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33653">
        his zombiefication (Is that even a word?) is exposed in a brutal but comedic manner.<br />
<br />
Art looks pretty well done and detailed (especially the gore part.. Wouldnt want that to be censored now would we?) <br />
Sound is pretty above average. Nothing to add here.<br />
<br />
Introducing the only male harem lead who is a Zombie...<br />
Aikawa Ayumu.. Hmm.. Other than the fact he possess inhuman powers, he is infact weak towards the sun.. Thats odd? Zombies are weak towards the sun but vampire ninjas are OK? <br />
So he also possess the power to change into a Masou Shojo which never fails to make me barf each time. Seriously, no kidding, I skip the entire transformation sequence, and you would too if you&#039;re a TRUE man.<br />
Sure he is a T.K wannabe in break dancing and he has a fetish for little sister and he has a perverted best friend and he doesn&#039;t live with his parents etc etc, the fact he has his own harem means deep down he is a good guy and every good guy deserves a harem. Just wondering why I haven&#039;t gotten mine yet...<br />
<br />
So lets review the girls shall we? My favorite part of all harem anime<br />
<br />
Candidate number #1<br />
A necromancer? Silver haired, endowed with super imbalanced powers, and yet a fragile existence you feel like you just wanna protect. Best part is? She won&#039;t say a word which means less arguments and more *ehmm* time if ya know what I mean? ;) What you dont know what I mean? Sheesh, what are they teaching you kids in class nowadays.<br />
Harem Girl score: 9.0<br />
<br />
Candidate number #2<br />
A masou shojo with a chainsaw who lets everyone change into a magical girl except herself. Typical tsundere with flat chest, but claims to have the highest IQ of them all. Sassy and courageous, she&#039;s the first of the magical that actually has an attitude. However, he inability to cook anything but eggs doesn&#039;t look in her favour for guys who&#039;s a glutton. Who cares anyways? Ayumu is a zombie and all he eats is brains.. (No seriously, zombies should eat brains)<br />
Harem Girl Score: 8.8<br />
<br />
Candidate number #3<br />
A Ninja Vampire?? Who writes this stuff anyways?? Approximately D-E cup, this natural beauty is equipped with not only a sharp tongue, but with a superiority complex. Master of the leaf blade but only able to use a single technique, terrible chef and not much of a genius, some guys still like her due to her busty looks and long black hair. Probably slim chances of being in Ayumu&#039;s harem but she&#039;s living under the same roof with him so she&#039;s practically in it without even knowing it herself. Good luck to Ayumu trying to get this one.<br />
Harem Girl score: 9.0<br />
<br />
Candidate number #4<br />
Another Ninja Vampire?? Oh c&#039;mon now.. Anyways, my personal favourite, tom boyish, a bit of an air head but still charming in her own way. Probably the only character up to date that actually have feelings for zombie boy over here due to some unforseen circumstances (If you&#039;re a cult member of the harem revolution, then you probably have a slight gist of how this happened)<br />
Harem Girl score: 9.2 <br />
EXTRA POINTS FOR BEING ABLE TO COOK!<br />
<br />
I rate the comedy of this anime to be a fusion of MM! + Dokuro-chan<br />
due to it&#039;s extreme slapstick jokes and the never ending pain the male lead has to suffer. But look at the bright side.. He can never be put out of his misery... Wouldn&#039;t you want an immortal body when you have a harem all to yourself?<br />
<br />
Overall Gore+Comedy+Supernatural+Chainsaw wielding Magical Girl+Crossplaying = Kore wa Zombie Desu, which can also be equals to animegasm. (Im just randomly adding words here) And some fan-service to boot.<br />
<br />
<br />
SPOILER!<br />
Everyone&#039;s favourite GIGA PUDDI made an appearance in episode 3 :)

    So what is &#039;Is This A Zombie?&#039; aka &#039;Koreha Zombie Desu ka?&#039;<br />
<br />
Zombie Desu ka (as I&#039;ll refer to it from now on) is an anime that abuses genre cliches, it&#039;s horrendously inconsistent, shockingly violent and has some of the most uncomfortable shots of a guy&#039;s ass on several occasions...and it&#039;s easily one of the funniest animes I&#039;ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
YES. Zombie Desuka is the BUSINESS. I honestly couldn&#039;t contain my laughter ever since the dynamic and hysterical first episode. What makes this anime so special is, as I&#039;ve mentioned, how it abuses genre cliches such as harem, shonen, fantasy, fanservice and even a bit of heavily

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113617">
        implied yaoi. There&#039;s an ample amount of fanservice in this anime, ranging from your typical &#039;pantsu&#039; shots to bouncing cleavage, but there&#039;s also a surprising amount of fujoshi bait (and by that I mean moments that would make girl fans cream themselves) which is a nice balance. So while it was uncomfortable to see the main character&#039;s ass every so often, I can take it as fair since modern animes try more to appeal to both perverse fanbases.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the main character, Ayumu is your typical, lazy-eyed, dangling spiky hair protagonist. You can draw comparisons between him and Tomoya from Clannad and Ichika from infinite Stratos, but I believe that he is a lot like Sato from the anime Ben-To. They&#039;re both energetic guys who don&#039;t go out of their way to be perverted but are definitely guys who wouldn&#039;t pass a chance to take a look, nor do they act all bashful when they&#039;re caught. In fact, there&#039;s a lot of similarities between Ben-To and Zombie Desu ka, from the absurd plot devices, the pacing and tone as well as the random comedy. And like Ben-To, I found myself surprised by wacky elements popping up every so often and it was great how it managed to blend with the semi-serious story. I&#039;ve grown fond of animes like this; the whole &#039;comedy action fanservice&#039; genre, cause it manages to not take itself too seriously but delivers a hilarious plot with some great action and fanservice shots. It&#039;s a delicate balance that few animes manage to achieve properly, but these few are pretty amazing. Animes such as Heaven&#039;s Lost Property and Highschool DxD have much &#039;darker&#039; stories and heavy ecchi/ fanservice, whereas animes like Ben-To and Zombie Desuka are lite on the fanservice but emphasize the wacky side more often.<br />
<br />
So as the title implies, the anime revolves around Ayumu being a zombie, resurrected by a quiet, moe necromancer named &#039;Eu&#039; who treats him as a servant and friend. He uses his newfound life, and surprisingly superhuman powers, to find his killer. If this all sounds awfully serious and deep, trust me the first episode derails that by the end. The dramatic air that the first few minutes of the first episode give off is immediately dispelled by a hilarious moment when Ayumu gets hit by a car in a wacky fashion. By the end of the episode, I shit you not, he becomes a magical garment girl on top of being a zombie, doing a whole long-ass magical girl transformation and everything, with PANTY SHOTS AND EVERYTHING *shudders*. The weird train doesn&#039;t end there, as he ends up having a &#039;masou-shoujo&#039; in this house, then later a vampire ninja girl (with big boobs, cause why not) and eventually has another vampire ninja girl (also well endowed) end up falling in love with him, under ridiculous, parody-cliche circumstances. While this all sounds like a cluster of absurd plot devices, it&#039;s exactly what makes this anime so hilarious.<br />
<br />
One of the defining features of Zombie Desu ka is the aforementioned moe necromancer, Eu. Her full name is &#039;Eucliwood Hellscythe&#039; and she takes the quiet moe girl cliche to a whole new level. What I found very creative is how, while she doesn&#039;t speak at all and prefers to write down what she wants to say, the main character imagines her voice in his head, saying perverted things in place of the normal request she asked. This is done each episode by a different voice actress (both in the sub and dub) so you&#039;re never sure which voice is her real one, and it&#039;s probably one of the most creative things about her character. While there&#039;s a lot of cliches in her design, her reason for not speaking are actually quite dramatic. The explanation comes off as a load of over-complicated fantasy mumbo-jumbo, but it fits in with the semi-serious tone of the show and it&#039;s a major plot device. I won&#039;t ruin too much but there&#039;s a lot of surprises in store regarding her reasons for not speaking, and trust me you&#039;ll wanna see what those reasons are.<br />
<br />
The antagonists in this anime are unexpected but manage to be entertaining in their own ways, and the overarching main bad guy delivers one of THE funniest lines in the second to last episode. The final episode decides to take all the cliches it hadn&#039;t touched upon and abuse them to a comedic end as well, and so does the OVA episode. While this can be considered a harem anime at its base level it surprisingly manages to dodge a ton of genre cliches or use them in moderation; strange for an anime that parodies cliches. It almost never uses the typical &#039;walk in on girl naked&#039; cliche and &#039;fall on and grope girl&#039; cliche that animes like To Love Ru are infamous for, and when it does the result is violent retribution (as usual) which is balanced by the fact that Ayumu is a zombie so any physical damage is real but doesn&#039;t last. The main character however does go through a ton of physical and verbal abuse from start to finish, being called &#039;pervert&#039; and &#039;maggot&#039; for a ton of different reasons, a lot of which is funny. However the vampire ninja girl Sera does weigh on your patience with her persistent insults and she&#039;s not even a tsundere or love interest waiting to happen, she&#039;s more of the freeloader who has her own motives and shits on the main character all the time. While she is hot and her insults are funny for the most part, it can become annoying after a while. Despite that, every character manages to be goofy and funny in a variety of ways so small things like that don&#039;t get in the way.<br />
<br />
That isn&#039;t to say that Zombie Desu Ka is perfect, far from it. There&#039;s a lot of plot holes, inconsistencies and moments that go unanswered. There&#039;s characters that get introduced but disappear just as quickly or aren&#039;t seen often. There&#039;s plot devices that are mentioned or implied, but never expanded upon. And there&#039;s a lot of issues regarding the depth of Ayumu&#039;s powers and why he&#039;s able to steal someone else&#039;s powers. However, I don&#039;t believe that any of these are an issue since the animes M.O. from the start was to abuse plot devices and cliches, so you tend to go with the flow rather than look for answers in a semi-serious anime. A lot of the occurrences in animes like Excel Saga go unexplained and we accept them purely because it&#039;s wacky fun, and whilst a lot of comedy animes have a decent amount of wacky elements I&#039;d say that Zombie Desu Ka is one of the few animes that fully embraces the wacky side. Despite the inconsistencies, there&#039;s a lot of subtle things that this anime does well. The animation is solid and the fight scenes are fluid and epic. The music is upbeat and can be mellow when dramatic things occur. The plot device of Ayumu hating the sun since it dries him up (strange plot device for a zombie, I know) is interestingly accentuated by how blinding the light is during the day and each character has one or two defining quirks just like this, including the main bad guy. So while it was the kind of anime you don&#039;t have to think too deeply about, it was easy on the eyes too.<br />
<br />
In the end, what can I say about Zombie Desu Ka? It&#039;s absurd, it&#039;s violent, it&#039;s random and it&#039;s just plain weird sometimes. But it&#039;s also hilarious, epic, touching at times and surprising at other times. I don&#039;t usually give numbered scores but if I could give this anime a score i&#039;d give it a 9/10. I&#039;ve only watched the first season so far so I have big hopes for the second. I watched the dub of it, and the cast did a phenomenal job, especially with the many voices that portrayed Eu in Ayumu&#039;s thoughts. Both the japanese and english versions manage to be funny for their own reasons in both the delivery of jokes and contexts of funny situations, so each is a unique watch. I look forward to watching the dub of the second season and I really hope it doesn&#039;t derail itself like too many second seasons do. However if it&#039;s like Heaven&#039;s Lost Property or Highschool DxD, it can only get better and funnier. Despite all the physical violence, verbal abuse, weird situations and world ending events that come across Ayumu&#039;s way, he can take it. Why? Cause he&#039;s a zombie.

    Have you ever seen an anime you were convinced was going to be really cool and interesting and only just to have it let you down to no end?  Welcome to my experience with Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka.  After two episodes which presented a genuinely interesting and refreshing take on the harem genre (interesting takes on mythological creatures, nobody particularly interested in each other romantically, basically just putting up with each other simply because they have to), this series succumbs to the harem tropes it actively avoids and just becomes ultimately a very lazy series.<br />
<br />
The initial concept for this show is actually

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37388">
        pretty interesting, with Ayumu who has just recently become a zombie living with the necromancer who resurrected him because, well what else is he going to do realistically.  After his transformation, they meet other mythological creatures and beings such as a magical school girl and a vampire ninja.  They fight creatures called megalos which are evil spirits that actually have some really creative and inspired designs to them.  In one episode, they fight a giant whale in a school uniform that would put Sin from Final Fantasy X to shame.  In another, they fight a giant enemy crab and attack its weak point for massive damage.  One of the big points of humor in these fights is how as a zombie Ayumu basically has no powers, so he has to use magical girl powers a la Sailor Moon, which include gratuitous transformation sequences (it’s actually pretty funny in practice.)  In this regard, the first half of the series is the best because it focuses on the sheer lunacy of the entire situation and the creatures they have to fight.   <br />
<br />
But then something terrible happens, Zombie No Desu Ka starts to take itself seriously.  This show, about a zombie living who uses magical girl powers and lives with a necromancer, another magical girl and a vampire ninja, starts to take itself incredibly seriously for some reason right around episode 4 or 5 and it absolutely kills the momentum.  When the show isn’t having fun with its ridiculous premise, its bogged down by pointless drama about Ayumu’s killer or a story arc later in the series that is so ridiculous that I can’t believe they even animated it.  On top of all this, after episode 6 the show just starts to become a victim of the same tired harem/ecchi anime tropes that we’ve seen a million times before.  The jokes start to get really lazy, the girls start to get interested in Ayumu, a new tsundere vampire ninja is introduced, and the entire show just becomes a drag.  It just drags itself through the motions up until the final episode, which is almost unwatchable.  It’s a pool episode featuring some terrible J-Pop performances from the cast of girls that I’m convinced almost made my ears bleed.  How in the hell did we get to this point?<br />
<br />
This is what happens when you completely forget why your show works and just start pulling stuff out of thin air to kill time.  This show could have been really cool by sticking to having fun with its absurd initial set up and following it through to the end.  I was completely on board to enjoy this show thoroughly.  Please don’t waste your time on this show.  It’s a crime that a show like this ended up getting better ratings across Japan than a masterpiece like Fractale, despite this being a wasted opportunity.  If you want a real comedy series, look elsewhere; this will just leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.<br />

    Hello, folks. Today we&#039;ll talk about `Koreha Zombie Desuka?&#039;, whose original name is 「これはゾンビですか？」, henceforth called `KoreZom&#039;. First, allow me to tell you that I&#039;ve never read the original Light Novel, as well as never read any of the adaptation manga. So, every opinion bases itself on the anime, and no comparisons between adaptations are made.<br />
<br />
Well then, let us begin.<br />
<br />
~!~<br />
<br />
Story: 9 out of 10.<br />
KoreZom has lots of comedy, but even though it manage to unfold an very interesting plot. Since, once again, it has great focus over the comedy, I really wasn&#039;t expecting any story at all. I&#039;ve seen comedy animes that just had almost

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34647">
        no plot; the anime seemed to flow only over its own jokes, but there was no development. Well then, KoreZom is not like that. As a matter of fact, its plot is much more well thought than other animes of this very season.<br />
I was going to give it 8, but it turned out 9 because the jokes are all very well timed and played, so much that they affect positively the story itself.<br />
By the way, every character seems to have cool backgrounds, but I fear those aren&#039;t going to be shown, unless we get a second season.<br />
<br />
~!~<br />
<br />
Art: 10 out of 10.<br />
It is beautiful. The characters&#039; designed is cool and well-done, from casual outfits to a necromancer&#039;s armored outfit. Emotions are well expressed, too. Also very fitting are the backgrounds, from a high school to a graveyard, they&#039;re all very expressing, and cool.<br />
<br />
~!~<br />
<br />
Sound: 10 out of 10.<br />
Great voice acting, general background effects, as well as a rocking awesome opening! The ending music kind of sucks, although being funny, but since there&#039;s no reason to hear it, I didn&#039;t count it.<br />
There&#039;s really not much to say, really. It is just great.<br />
<br />
~!~<br />
<br />
Character: 10 out of 10.<br />
Now that&#039;s where that show shines. A cool zombie lead male, an even cooler necromancer girl (well, she&#039;s my fav anime girl), a bad-mouthed vampire ninja, an extravagant masou-shoujo (a pun with mahou-shoujo), and that&#039;s not even the beginning. Funny as hell friends, psychopath villains, and (yet again) funny enemies called `Megalos&#039;.<br />
Damn, the characters are splendid, each one of them.<br />
<br />
~!~<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10 out of 10.<br />
Cool characters, well timed and played jokes, nice artwork, and a interesting story. How could you not enjoy it? You&#039;ll laugh out loud, pause at a certain zombie&#039;s delusions, re-watch the cool moments, and have chills in the spine with Yuu (also called Eu).<br />
<br />
~!~<br />
<br />
Overall: 10 out of 10.<br />
That&#039;s it, folks. There&#039;s absolutely no reason to look down or overlook this fantastic anime. Each episode proves better than the previous, and you&#039;ll catch yourself counting days until the next episode. The best thing is that there&#039;s more to come! And maybe we got even a second season.<br />
Now, I know that there will be folks that won&#039;t like it the way I do, for everybody has its own tastes. But well, that&#039;s my opinion: this anime is a masterpiece, whose only drawback is the low number of episodes.<br />
<br />
Until next time!

    &quot;Kore wa Zombie desu ka?&quot; is, despite what the &quot;Zombie&quot; in its title might suggest, the extreme opposite of every zombie show you&#039;ve ever seen before. Forget about mindless monsters trying to eat you alive. What we have here is a harem mixed with slapstick comedy, magic and lots of gore.<br />
<br />
Story: As in most harem animes, the actual story is not the show&#039;s main focus. However, at first glance, it seems quite a promising one for its genre, though pretty simple: A high school student is murdered after he is attacked by an unknown person. However, he is revived as a zombie with the help

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33855">
        of a weird necromancer girl. From then on, he serves as her undead servant, while at the same time searching for the one who killed him, as well as continuing his school life. Various other (female) characters are also introduced, including a magic girl and a vampire-ninja, each with their own mini-backstories.<br />
<br />
Art-Animation: Like most of the latest anime, the animation is very good. The designs are crisp and well drawn, and I dare say quite pretty. I can&#039;t say that I have any particular problem with it whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Sound: The voice acting does its job well, with the voices being properly funny or serious depending on what is needed. There is nothing really memorable about them, but that&#039;s not nececerily a bad thing, as long as the job gets done. What I do have to aplaud  is the OP, which is officially my third favourite OP of all time (behind only the OP of Umineko and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni).<br />
<br />
Characters: To the core, the characters in &quot;Kore wa Zombie desu ka?&quot; are pretty much the usual Harem stereotypes: A teenage guy surrounded by a bunch of girls (which include the typical tsundere, loli etc). However, the fact that they all belong in the supernatural world slightly changes things. They can all be quite kickass at times (except for the Necromancer girl, who is extremely docile 99% of the time, but bringing people back from the dead is even cooler anyway ;) ). They can all be hilariouly funny at the same time, and they all seem to have some higher goal in life than just sleeping with the other characters - which some of them also have, nontheless. To sum it up, they seem like proper characters, unlike in the majority of harem animes. I mean, what other harem features a zombie and a vampire ninja among the protagonists? <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: This a harem anime, so fanservice and tyical harem humor is always going to be there. But there is much more to it than that. The element of slapstic comedy is always there. What is unusual is the excecive (for the genre) amount of gore - which can be strangely funny, rather than shocking, at times. Add to that all the supernatural stuff... you &#039;ve got yourself a very good combination right?<br />
<br />
Overall: Harem, Comedy, Supernatural, Gore, School Life... there are not many series that combine all these. &quot;Kore wa Zombie desu ka?&quot; does so, and it seems to do so well. If you like any of the above genres, you &#039;ve got to give this a try. You might love it or you might not... but you&#039;ll never know until you try for yourself.

    Oh boy... This show. I find myself torn while writing this, on one hand there were some extremely funny and enjoyable moments where I could not stop laughing. But on the other hand there were some downright terrible moments where I was raising my head to the ceiling praying for the scene to end. Is this a Zombie is an anime that makes it&#039;s mark by throwing in every genre, every character type, every trope, just everything really. If you can think of it there is a high probability you&#039;ll find it in this show. But despite throwing everything under the sun into this anime,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182410">
        I would never dream of calling it cliche, and actually say it is extraordinarily unique. <br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
<br />
Guy meets girl, they kind of like each other, plot ensues, girl now lives with guy, more girls live with guy, etc, etc. While some of the specifics may be new, the overall concept is nothing we have not seen. <br />
The Zombie and Necromancer (a.k.a servant and master) relationship was well done. Tack onto that the school life setting with a guy just trying to pass through along with his nerdy best friend; it was all well done, though a bit unoriginal. The eccentricities and unique nature of this show come in when we meet a chain-saw wielding Magical Girl (though she uses her magic a whole lot less than Ayumu...) and a busty Vampire Ninja with a leaf sword. Not gonna lie, her concept is fucking amazing. This show throws in every concept you can think of but somehow manages to make it work. <br />
I would be remiss if I did not mention my largest gripe with the show, the fact that Ayumu is more or less our magical girl... Maybe I am alone, but I do not find cross-dressing to be a very funny plot point, I just don&#039;t. But even then I can sometimes see how it could work in a story if well done. But sadly, I did not find this to be one of those times. You see, Ayumu doesn&#039;t like it, first time, first episode, he dislikes transforming into a magical girl with a pink frilly outfit complete with panties and a bow. Hates it may be a more accurate statement. But every time he is forced to do so, he gets an unbelievable amount of shit from the other characters for doing it. Forced to cross dress in pink to save them all, and they insult him for doing so. Sorry, not a scenario I found even remotely amusing or entertaining. <br />
<br />
Art: 7 <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t really say much here, it felt exceedingly average. But since the average these days (for 2011) is still good, it gets a 7. Though I should mention I really liked the character designs. I can&#039;t say anything on their artistic value, just a specific aspect I found really nice. <br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
<br />
I found that the OST really just did it&#039;s job. Set the scene, nothing more. But what I absolutely loved was the voice acting. I came into this show long after it aired, long enough that there was in fact an English Dub, and that is what I watched. Stone me, go ahead. Spout your insults and hate for the one who neglected to watch it subbed but had the audacity to write a review. Ignoring the hate though, I loved the English Dub. I thought the voices were perfect and added to the hilarity of the scenes, while also capturing some of the more emotional moments fairly well. <br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
<br />
This was a rather fun cast of characters. They all seemed to fall into archetypes, but were extremely memorable despite that. <br />
<br />
Ayumu Aikawa- Our zombie protagonist who is a nice enough guy but with that laid back, bored disposition. I rather liked Ayumu, he was fairly similar to other harem leads in that he isn&#039;t the most popular, isn&#039;t extremely capable physically or intellectually, but still sits in the back right side of the classroom next to a window. He gets a lot of abuse in this show, verbal and physical. Being immortal the characters feel no guilt in stabbing him. Being the nice guy he takes it all with a bit of disbelief but really just goes along with it.<br />
<br />
Eucliwood Hellscythe- I thought I had seen the quiet character exhibited perfectly in Yuki Nagato. Boy was I wrong. Eucliwood (though everyone calls her Eu) is the character that I consider to be the ultimate moe blob of adorable. She takes the quiet nature to a whole new level by literally not saying a word, but writing everything on little notepads. Though giving off an uncaring persona, she is actually extremely kind hearted. Where I truly applaud the creators is the way Eu had a different voice actress for every episode. Now for a character that doesn&#039;t speak it may seem difficult to have a voice actress; luckily our perverted main is here to imagine Eu complimenting him in a suggestive format. It was well done and extremely enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Haruna- The resident Tsundere Magical Girl who is a self proclaimed genius and makes great eggs. She really is just a fun character with a ton of energy. She doesn&#039;t have the best memory and freeloads at Ayumu&#039;s home eating more food than anyone else. <br />
<br />
Seraphim- The busty Vampire Ninja, she is extremely cold towards our main character but gets along with others well enough. My issue with Seraphim is that she is accurately summed up by the word bitch. Obviously there is a bit more to her than that attribute alone, but that forms the crux of her character and it left liking her a very arduous task...<br />
<br />
My biggest issue with the characters is that they all seem to give Ayumu a bit too much crap. Don&#039;t get me wrong, at times it was hilarious to watch them all insult Ayumu. But in my not-so-professional opinion this show needed a character that Ayumu could get along with. In my head this equated to a character that acted in a more playful manner rather than a degrading one. Sexual innuendo or playfully teasing, just someone that alleviated the constant barrage of shit Ayumu received. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
<br />
My enjoyment overall is limited to a 7. When this show was good, it was GREAT, but when it wasn&#039;t great I honestly considered it be rather bad. My opinion in this facet is probably rather polarized from the majority, but for every scene I loved I found one I disliked as well. My enjoyment did swing in a positive manner on the whole, but nevertheless I had my issues. <br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
<br />
This show takes every thought that could pop into a writer&#039;s brain and throws it into an oddly coherent plot. Combined with a fun cast and good voice acting, comedy, some action, and even the occasional emotional moment, you get a genuinely good show. This show is definitely good for a laugh. Even if you are like me and dislike main characters who get a ton of shit, I would still recommend this show. If you&#039;re on the fence about the show than I would recommend watching the first two episodes as they perfectly exhibit what this show is: A fun 12 episodes that is even complimented by a second season. Is This a Zombie is a good anime that combines every cliche into something unique.

    alright this is my first review ever, so it might be kinda sloppy, lets see here<br />
<br />
Story 7/10<br />
The story itself isn&#039;t really anything special, the protagonist is a zombie, living with a necromancer, but it is different from most other magical anime&#039;s so i&#039;ll cut them some slack.<br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
The art for the majority of the episode is again, nothing amazing, but the show does have a well done intro with some satisfying looking animation, and i&#039;m hoping to see some animation like that in later episodes of the show, so for now they get an 8. Also random addition, this episode has lots of blood for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33644">
        those of you who are a little squeamish <br />
<br />
Sound 7/10<br />
Absolutely nothing about the music really stood out to me, except maybe a few moments where I went &quot;well this is kinda catchy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Character 9/10<br />
I give characters a 9 not because their especially compelling but most because their entertainment factor was through the roof for me. Just the way the protagonist seems to interact and react with his world, even the way he narrates as a character; I found very appealing. Additionally they did make some room in this episode for some potentially more serious and in depth character development later in the show, not much, but they did leave room.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
I&#039;ve only been watching anime for 6 months, but pilot episode literally made me laugh out loud, which only two other anime have been able to do so far, I spent a lot of the episode thinking about how ridiculous the situations were, but O so very entertaining :P. Just watch out for some unexpected fanservice and a lot of of wtf moments :P<br />
<br />
Overall 9/10<br />
If you like ridiculous comedies, magical girls, ecchi....and blood, you&#039;ll likely really enjoy this anime.

    *This may contain a few spoilers*<br />
<br />
At first I thought Kore wa zombie desu ka? was going to be one of those fantasy-comedy anime without an actual storyline and with lots of boring episodes. Fortunately, it was much better than I thought.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
I was very surprised that this had a plot. It really did. The story focuses on a high school boy, Ayumu, who is both a zombie and a Magiclad Girl (Yeah, I know, kinda weird) and his supernatural friends, Eu, Haruna and Sera who fight against all kind of creatures. This might seem a little mediocre and it is because as the show goes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review141125">
        on, more and more unearthly phenomena occur and strange characters show up. But, like I said, I am glad that the anime followed a decent plot with some unexpected events and it wasn&#039;t just a stupid comedy.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound: 9<br />
Both were good. The characters have many details and some distinctive features, the magical creatures are ok and the outdoor scenery is good, so I don&#039;t have much to say. My eyes liked what they saw.<br />
<br />
Character: 6<br />
Here, unfortunately, we have some stereotypical characters: Ayumu - the easy-going teenager who cares a lot about his friends and wants to protect them. Eu - the most powerfull character, silent but very smart, full of emotions and very altruistic. Haruna - the funny girl, always smiling who falls in love with Ayumu. Sera - the sensible one, with a strong character who likes being in charge of everything,<br />
There is truly nothing special about those characters, none of them stands out. On the other hand, I apperciate the huge character development. Ayumu starts to care about Eu when she leaves and realizes she&#039;s very important to him. Eu also realizes that she&#039;s not a soulless monster and she has friends who would die for her and Sera abandons her mission to kill Eu because she finally understood that friends are the most important thing in the world.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
It wasn&#039;t a brilliant anime, even far from a good one, but I somehow enjoyed watching it. It was funny indeed (especially Ayumu&#039;s transformation into a Magiclad Girl), it was violent indeed (which I liked the most) and it had some heartbreaking moments which really got to my feels. As I said, there were some boring episodes, unrelated to the actual plot but at least they were funny.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
I rated Kore wa zombie desu ka? 7 because it represented a nice surprise for me. The series exceeded my expectations which is really awesome and if the caracters were a little more original, I would give it an 8.<br />
What can I say... If you like fantasy-comedy-harem with some gore and romance anime, you should really watch this. It might be a disappointment for some people but on the contrary, I find this anime better than I thought it would be.

    Looking back on this show I question myself how I enjoyed this show. Riddled with fanservice, a harem which means no actual romance, and a cast of invincible characters. Our good male lead Ayumu is a zombie, taking an arm or two is but a flesh wound, and our female lead  has enough magic power that the universe is changed at her emotions and words. The action scenes are enjoyable and occur frequently but nothing extraordinary. They aren&#039;t afraid to show a bit of blood though!<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, there is something about the comedy in this set up that makes every episode worth watching. Of course

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37941">
        being undead gives the genre slapstick a new meaning, and by the end of the first episode Ayumu gains the power of Masou Shoujo. Yes that’s right - he is a magical zombie cross dresser wielding a pink chainsaw. If you don&#039;t find it funny the first time he transforms well you will definitely get sick of it by the end of the show. <br />
<br />
Now I did look down on the show earlier for the fanservice. However, that doesn&#039;t mean I didn&#039;t enjoy the female cast. Eu is our mute armored necromancer who doesn&#039;t get much of an appearance in the show till later because, well, she is mute. I liked her appearances but story wise she made a lot of decisions that didn&#039;t make sense. <br />
<br />
Haruna is the masou shoujo who has lost her powers and is the pain in the ass tsundere that lives in Ayumu&#039;s house. The fanservice target, she is the most prominent female character. Another person who can be a break or make on your takeaway from the show. <br />
<br />
Sera is a vampire, whose story of origin was horrible. Yet, voiced by Youko Hisaka, one of the more fun characters. She has a running gag of how horribly she can verbally abuse the main character, but is also a ninja at the same time. She is never prominent in the story, but makes steady appearances throughout.<br />
<br />
Yuki, another vampire, acts as the wife or Ayumu, reasons to be left to your imagination, and is the only character that&#039;s dere was actually enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Despite being a strong comedy, it attempts to have a serious plot at times. At these times it fails to be serious, and you are left wondering if they intended to make the plot a joke (in more ways than one). It starts out with how Ayumu wants to get revenge on his murderer, but despite how mysterious it seems like it will be at the start the intensity vanishes until he easily finds them a few episodes in. From there the plot switches to Eu&#039;s past mistake and the whole situation is rather ridiculous. <br />
<br />
If you enjoy a mix of peculiar comedy and have a tolerance for harem settings this could be the show for you. The atmosphere is typically bright except for those random serious moments they throw at the viewer. <br />

    I&#039;ve always suspected that sometimes people request anime reviews from me because they want to see how I&#039;ll react to a particular really bad anime. That suspicion has been confirmed. Today&#039;s review was requested specifically because &quot;Ive seen Ktulu review some real crappy stuff (I think I saw Baka to Test somewhere), so I thought this would be &#039;right up his alley&#039; reviewing-wise.&quot; Yes, that is an actual quote. Is it really that bad? Let&#039;s take a look and find out. <br />
<br />
Kore wa zombie desu ka follows a magical girl zombie who lives with the necromancer who brought him back to life, a magical girl

          <span style="display: none;" id="review64519">
        and a vampire ninja. It&#039;s every bit as stupid as it sounds. There is an over-arching story but it&#039;s really basic. An enemy shows up, the group has to fight him. You might think that, as stupid as the premise is, it has to get some good humour out of it. Nope. The humour is as weak and imbecilic as the story. Most of it is simply the same joke repeated. Ayumu is a zombie, watch as he gets abused. The series tries to mix comedy and seriousness but it fails at both and the mixing of the two just makes it more pronounced. The last episode is a pointless fan-service episode and the relationship developments are just grody. <br />
<br />
The characters are the same one-dimensional cliches that pop up in every poorly written harem anime. The clingy jealous girl, the quiet but kind girl, the tsundere girl, and the girl who gets pulled into the situation through an absurd plot contrivance that makes her feel like she has no choice but to pursue the main character and, of course, the completely unremarkable and utterly boring protagonist who can&#039;t make up his bloody mind. It doesn&#039;t help that all of the characters are idiots. We&#039;re told that Haruna is a genius, but she acts like a complete and utter twit so it&#039;s as much of an informed characteristic as the marksmanship skills of Imperial Stormtroopers. <br />
<br />
The art is mediocre. It could be better if not for the strange art decisions at some points and the over-reliance on fan-service. Yeah, there&#039;s a massive amount of fan-service. Since it&#039;s a harem anime, this should come as no surprise. <br />
<br />
The voice acting is pretty dull. The only actor who seems to be putting in any effort is Nomizu Iori, the rest of the main cast sound like they&#039;re bored most of the time. And she exaggerates to an absurd degree. If I wasn&#039;t familiar with the cast from other series I might suspect that they just made bad casting calls, but I&#039;ve heard all of the main cast and most of the secondary cast in roles where they gave much better performances These aren&#039;t incompetent actors, this is incompetent directing. The music is the best part of the series. It&#039;s actually pretty good. It&#039;s got a lot of energy and the performances are well done. <br />
<br />
The yuri factor is a 3/10. Seraphim and Haruna have some moments, and there&#039;s one moment with Haruna and Eu. But they never go anywhere and the series is quick to dismiss them. <br />
<br />
My final rating for Kore wa zombie desu ka is a 1.5/10. It&#039;s not one of the absolute worst anime I&#039;ve seen, but it comes pretty close. The story and humour are rubbish and the characters are completely unsympathetic with no redeeming qualities. The only thing worthwhile is the music and you don&#039;t have to watch the mind-numbingly stupid series to hear it.

    Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? was certainly an interesting show.  What initially attracted me to the show was that the main character was in fact a zombie and after seeing that it was labeled as a harem story I was interested to see where it would go.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
Ok, personally I really enjoyed this show.  However I would say that the story was the show&#039;s major weak point.  The initial premise of the story is extremely unique and interesting.  Main character and normal high schooler Ayumu Aikawa is murdered by a serial killer, is then brought back to life as a zombie

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36028">
        by a necromancer and now is trying to discover who killed him and why, certainly a somewhat dark and unique idea.  However with the introduction of Masou-Shoujo Haruna, the story takes a turn for the weird and comedic.  After being cut in half by Haruna&#039;s chainsaw during a battle, Ayumu accidentally absorbs her magic and must now take over her role of fighting demons as a Mahou-Shoujo, complete with transformation sequence and frilly pink dress.  And that basically is how the rest of the show proceeds.  It constantly walks the line between &quot;wow this is a dark bloody action anime&quot; and &quot;boy in a pink dress encounters harem hijinks.&quot;  This results in the pacing of the show being somewhat off and at times I felt as if I was watching two completely different shows.  Most of the time there was no particular reason for why the story progressed the way it did, things would just kind of happen and then the characters would respond.  <br />
<br />
This having all been said though, the comedic aspect of the show was great and almost every episode something would be said or happen that would provoke a laugh out of me and the show does tell a compelling and unique story when it decides to get serious.  Despite also being labeled a harem genre, this is only a minor detail in the events of the main story and the overall feel of the show.<br />
<br />
Art and Sound: 8.5/10<br />
The animation in the show was very good I felt.  The scenery was good, the landscapes realistic, and the character designs were very unique and fresh.  The fight sequences and gore were extremely well done yet equal attention was given when dealing with the more comedic and ridiculous aspects of the show (flying whale monsters for example).  The sound was also excellent, the opening got you hooked and the ending theme was just plain fun and both were very original.  The voice acting was good as well, everyone delivered a great performance and fit their roles to a tee.  Plus Yuu&#039;s plethora of different voice actresses contributed to a great part of the series&#039; humor.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
The characters were definitely (in my opinion) the best part of the show.  They were modeled off past traditional character types but they were very fleshed out and there was a good amount of character development in the show across the boards.  Ayumu is not your typical average harem lead ( for one he&#039;s a zombie).  He&#039;s not overly perverted or boring in any way, he&#039;s just an average guy forced to deal with ridiculous situations and handles them accordingly, and unlike a normal harem lead he&#039;s got some redeeming qualities and is more than capable of being a badass when its crunch time.  I thought that all of the characters were hilarious in their own way though.  All of the rest of the characters in the show were mostly there for comic relief and fulfilled their roles excellently.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
Despite its faults, I really liked Kore wa? The whole time I was watching it I was just thinking to myself &quot;wow I love this show&quot;, even when I noticed plot inconsistencies or when I felt they went over the top with something.  It was hilarious, the characters were crazy, the story was original, and while the romantic and the serious aspects of the show often clashed, I felt both worked in their own right and made the show amazing.<br />
<br />
Summary: If you are looking for a show with great comedic value, unique characters, or just a different or ridiculous story, then I would highly recommend watching Kore wa Zombie desu ka?.  It was always fun, with its fair share of serious moments and interesting characters.  I highly recommend for fans of harems or offbeat comedies.

    Story/Characters: 10/10 of 10<br />
<br />
At the half-way point, this is a well wrought tale, with significant twists along the way. There is a certain amount of &quot;cliche elements&quot; in the telling, but what sets Kore wa Zombie desu ka? apart from the crowd and saves it from being a cliche ridden also ran is the way it turns each and every one of those cliches on its ear, pokes a wet willy in it, strips it of its dignity, and then tells it &quot;It is OK! People still love you even with all your warts!&quot; In other words, the show has an overriding irreverent tone and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34985">
        a mocking sense of humor about itself and the various genres from which it harvests its plot fodder. The show is extremely well written and funny, eliciting several &quot;laugh out loud&quot; moments per episode on average, but at the same time, it actually approaches tear inducing tenderness when it takes the time to focus on the protagonist and his savior/master/goddess of all that is dandere, Yuu. (I said almost... I don&#039;t think I have cried yet, though I am a notorious softy... just ask my kids.)<br />
<br />
The character of Yuu is a thing to behold. Moe in the extreme, she takes dandere to a new height, as she isn&#039;t just quiet, she doesn&#039;t talk, with the exception of dream sequences, labeled &quot;This is fantasy of our weak-hearted protagonist Aikawa Ayumu&quot;, in which she speaks with a high, pleading voice and calls him Onii-chan, complete with mooney eyes, and frequently scantily clad. She communicates by writing notes on a pad, frequently with a tsun edge in the writing, making her, I guess, a tsun-dan-dere character.  The other characters are good as well. The heavily tsundere Haruna, who is living with them until she recovers her Masou Shojo powers from Ayumu, is a bundle of contradictions, as a genius magical girl that can&#039;t seem to be bothered to remember mundane things like names or where she was supposed to be buying tofu for her magical girl teacher. The third member of the harem is Sera, the Vampire-Ninja who seeks Yuu&#039;s aid and stays with them when she is refused, hoping to earn Yuu&#039;s help, all the while referring to Ayumu as various names similar to &quot;worthless pile of $%!#&quot;. There are also Ayumu&#039;s friends at school, who he doesn&#039;t want to discover the truth about his living/unliving situation, as being the male living with a harem of magical/dangerous women is not something he thinks his high school buddies can handle.<br />
<br />
All this would rate a high, but not stellar score if it weren&#039;t for one thing that the show does: surprise! Just when I think that I have a handle on the show, it throws a curve. Just when I think I know where the story is headed, it changes course. And just when I think I have things figured out, it turns another corner and reveals that most of what you have seen is not really the way things are. When that is combined with the consistently funny dialog and over the top humor, it makes for an enjoyable ride!<br />
<br />
Art: 7 of 10<br />
<br />
The main failing in Kore wa Zombie desu ka? is the art, at least in my opinion. There are frequently times when it seems the backgrounds are neglected, and the character renditions sometimes have shortcuts. Much of the combat animation is choppy and awkward looking, though I will grant that some of this is intentional due to the nature of the zombie protagonist. His body moves in awkward ways at times. The character designs, with the exception of  Yuu, are also a bit generic, with Sera being the only human character that I have not mistaken for someone else at least briefly at some point in the show. The men are particularly generic, with the glasses of the &#039;best friend&#039; character distinguishing him from the protagonist. Luckily there are not many shots of men other than Ayumu. It is possible that this is mostly a personal problem and others see more distinction between the designs, but I particularly find it hard to distinguish Haruna from some of the other girls, either at his school or the &quot;friend&quot; in the hospital that shows up in the third episode. There are some parts that are beautifully done, but others that fall short. The magical transformation sequences are quite striking, in their visual effect and the humor value as well! Another aspect that bothers some, but not me, is the level of fan service and gore. I consider most of the fan service to be parody, and it never becomes prurient or of an overtly sexual nature. The gore is also frequently used for comic effect, and the show is, after all, about a zombie! One must anticipate a certain amount of blood and gore!<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not saying that there aren&#039;t some bits of excellence. Where the animators take the time to make the art shine, it is great. I just feel there are too many points at which they let it slide along at average.<br />
<br />
Music/Sound Effects: 8 of 10<br />
<br />
The opening music is very good and the incidental music is frequently spot on. The end music is a catchy little tune, but also a bit annoying, as is the super deformed animation used during it.<br />
<br />
Voice Acting: 8 of 10<br />
<br />
The main voice actors are well done, with Haruna and Sera having a nice blend of acerbic tone with the occasional softer side. The male lead is well done but nothing really that special either. The best friend character&#039;s voice I find annoying, but I think you are supposed to. The Megalo tend to all sound alike to me. The &quot;friend in the hospital&quot; is one of the strongest vocal performances, as that character goes through some pretty impressive changes and variations across the episodes the is featured in. The absolute winner in terms of voice acting is the sickly sweet voice of Yuu in Ayumu&#039;s weak-hearted fantasy life! She sounds absolutely endearing and devoted, as is appropriate for a fantasy of that sort.<br />
<br />
Overall Enjoyment: 10 of 10<br />
<br />
I am loving this show! I watch it first of the Monday shows that come out on Cruncyroll and will re-watch episodes most weeks. The combination of broad comedy, fun action sequences, macabre zombie mayhem, and strong plotting with a touch of sentimentality that sparkles with joy when it bubbles up to the surface make it a fun, fast paced, and thoroughly enjoyable ride! Oh, and Yuu is muy, muy dandere moe!!! But that isn&#039;t really why I like it. Honest...

    Ok, so call me EL Diablo, amigos, for giving this anime a rating of all 6&#039;s, but, HEY! That&#039;s how I looked at it, anyway there are a couple of more episode to go before the &quot;PIECE DE RESISTANCE&quot; of this anime and move to the new season, so, why all the 6&#039;s?<br />
 <br />
Ist, the story:<br />
<br />
Even it &#039;s genre are: Action, ecchi and magic, I think that comedy and mystery should be inculded since this anime did played with our minds as to who really killed the muchaho(male lead) and how his realtionship doing with the tres chicas (Yu, Sera and Haruna) if there is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34691">
        a love connection with any of them before ep 7. There is also a lot of laughs involve especially when the muchacho (lead male) is a reluctant cross dressing Mahou shoujo and other funny secnes which the 3 chicas gives the muchacho a lot of cabeza del dolor (headache). I never thought that there is still a main villan involved aside from Kyoko whom we now know is the serial killer, but you know I think it is only FAIR ( number 6) enough that we wait just a few more episode and see how things will turn up. <br />
<br />
2nd, the art:<br />
<br />
I&#039;d say for a anime with an action genre, I think that the art itself as to how the characters were drawn should have been given a much more symmetric body figure. Then again since there is comedy in it, so a 6 will do.<br />
<br />
3rd, the sound:<br />
<br />
Here, I&#039;m referring to the soundtrack, particularly the opening theme......What can I say, soy mucho gusto. By the way, I really hate the closing theme. So 6 it is.<br />
<br />
4th, characters:<br />
<br />
Aikawa Ayumu- A loner at frist, until he get&#039;s skewed to dead and resurrected, though he&#039;s greatful for the unfortunated thing that happen to him - co&#039;z he ain&#039;t lonely anymore, he&#039;s unable to enjoy summer co&#039;z the intense sun shine willl dried him out. He kinda function as a male bitch for the 3 chicas and it is unclear if any of them has any feelings for him. He always fantasize about Yu talking in a cutsy manner and he also did the same with Sera (only once). Now he&#039;s linked to Yuki a vampire ninja from another tribe, question is, does he like her?<br />
<br />
Eucliwood &quot;Yu&quot; Hellscythe - she was found by Aikawa sitting near a conveniences store, as just like that, they started chatting - Yu writing down her words rather that saying it and then the next moment she&#039;s reviving Aikawa. At fist I thought that she&#039;s the villian (how wrong am I). It is not know wheather she has feeling for Aikawa since she declared him his servant. Among the characters she&#039;s probably the most mysterious of all to the viewers, co&#039;z as the episode progresses we see a lot more that what we think she is. Who wouldn&#039;t know that she doesn&#039;t just revivie dead people, she also has powers for fighting and she did mentioned that her magical powers would still fuction even when she&#039;s dead,  does that mean she&#039;ll never die?<br />
<br />
Haruna &#039;Masou Shoujo&quot; - It&#039;s very clear as to why she stayed with the muchacho, she want&#039;s her powers back from the muchacho and as unlucky as it get&#039;s, both of them don&#039;t know how to do it, what puzzles me is why would the author of this anime decide to let Haruna maintain some of her powers, while her true form is stuck with the muchacho, also why did she since she already saw her sensie in ep 7, why didn&#039;t she took the opportunity to ask for help in getting her true form back from Aikawa? By the way, her near naked scene really adds to the encchiness of this anime.<br />
<br />
Seraphim &#039;Sera&#039;- is a vampire ninja sent to request Yu&#039;s help to come to their village, though she&#039;s the muchacho&#039;s servant (in word only) she doesn&#039;t seems to be like one co&#039;z as we watch the anime she&#039;s always engage Aikawa in petty bikering and cusses the poor muchacho everytime, I like her boobs.<br />
<br />
Yoshida Yuki - she only came around in ep 7 and her weapons are pretty wierd, her tribe is probably the only ones who uses Tonkastu soup as a weapon of choice - or maybe they used something else. She&#039;s cute, but I prefer either Haruna or Sera to be the muchacho&#039;s love interest. Like, that will happen.<br />
<br />
Ariel - who we now know is haruna&#039;s Dai Sensie, I wonder if she&#039;s the main villian?<br />
<br />
And last but not lease, Kyoko &quot;The serial killer&quot;- I guess she&#039;s the &quot;Piece de resistance.&quot; Or is she?<br />
<br />
I do have some questions about the character, but, who am I talking to anyway? Well a number 6 rating will do for this part. <br />
<br />
<br />
5th and 6th, Enjoyment and Overall: <br />
<br />
I guess this anime if fair enough to be enjoyed by early teens as young as 13 -15, since the ecchiness is rather quite mild and the blood scene were artistically done, Strongly it is not for children as young as 10 and below. So I give both a fair 6  co&#039;z the anime itself is not that bad but not too good either.<br />
<br />
PS: I have not read the manga, so pls bear with me, amigos.

    Is This a Zombie? is an anime I seen pop up on Netflix and I&#039;m glad to say that I gave it a watch! It reminded me of so many different shows such as &quot;My Bride&#039;s A Mermaid&quot;, &quot;B Gata H Kei&quot;, and &quot;Heaven&#039;s Lost Property&quot;. This is not to say this anime doesn&#039;t have a charm of it&#039;s own. I went into this show with not knowing what I was getting into really because I had heard nothing about it. Not gonna lie, the 1st episode was a bit over the top for me at first, but you get adjusted to it shortly after.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180926">
        I believe the reason I liked this show so much was because of the expectations I had when I began to watch it. The thing is, I had none! So I was thoroughly surprised when certain scenes occurred. This anime is to never to be taken seriously, if you take it seriously you lose the whole point of the show, which is to entertain you rather than to tell some complex story with plot twists up the ass. Now let&#039;s get into the sections of the show and what I liked and disliked. (I haven&#039;t watched the OVAs and the 2nd season at the time I&#039;m writing this review)<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
The show&#039;s story is a extremely weird but I LOVED IT. It&#039;s all about a boy who&#039;s name is Ayumu who was tragically killed by a serial killer and is brought back to &quot;life&quot; by a Necromancer named Eucliwood Hellscythe (Eu). Eu is the most powerful magical being in the world, but having all that power comes at a cost. After this encounter with Eu, Ayumu&#039;s life will never be the same. He then becomes friends with a Magical Garment Girl and a Vampire Ninja. Story sounds pretty crazy right? It only gets crazier as the story progresses. It was pretty unique and different in my eyes, so I enjoyed a lot.<br />
<br />
Art:8<br />
I&#039;m not very good when it comes to determining how Art is, compared to other anime and what not. But I enjoyed the art style for what it was. The colors really gave the show a nice feeling to it because they would always match depending on the scenario. Never seen any flaws with it in my eyes.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
To be completely honest, I don&#039;t remember hearing anything really memorable from the show. Which is a good and a bad thing. Its a good thing because it shows I found nothing wrong with the sound itself, but it didn&#039;t stand out much. So it was ok, the only song I remember was that blasted Ending. It was AMAZING, I almost always watched it whenever it came around. I honestly got giddy when it came to the end of episode so I could hear it again. The animation that goes with the ending also added to my enjoyment to it.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
The characters were both the one of the greatest things about the show and one of the downfalls of it as well. If you&#039;re not closely watching the show and just enjoying it for what it is, you&#039;ll find the 95% of the the characters are likeable and funny in their own ways. The situations they get themselves in are pretty hilarious as well. But when I took a better look at them, most of them are just one dimensional, there are a few exceptions mind you, but again MOST OF THEM are. Characters won&#039;t be much of a problem if you don&#039;t this anime seriously though. Most of them are all zany, even if they don&#039;t show it at first.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
This is easily one of the funniest anime I&#039;ve seen in a while. From the parodying of clichés, to the overall humor this anime provides, it&#039;s just a riot. Some people may find some of the rehashed jokes some characters use to be annoying but, I didn&#039;t mind them one bit. Another thing people may have a problem with is when this show is trying to be serious. This anime has the tendency to have a serious moment, have some humor and then a serious moment again. This may cause viewers to have a disconnect with serious moments. BUT, as I said before, this show is just for enjoyment. So if you don&#039;t take it seriously, you&#039;ll actually find some of the serious moments to be funny in itself. Some moments just didn&#039;t make sense even when I replayed over several times, but it didn&#039;t take away from my enjoyment<br />
<br />
Overall: 8.5-9<br />
This show was something I didn&#039;t imagine I&#039;d like very much, contrary to this, halfway through the 1st episode is where I just fell in love with it. As I&#039;ve stated several times in this review, if you take this show seriously you&#039;re not going to enjoy it much. If you turn your brain off for the 12 episodes this show has, you&#039;ll most likely enjoy it very much. Even when you turn your brain off, you may notice some things in the show that don&#039;t seem right, but you&#039;ll get over it no time.<br />
<br />
P.S. In my opinion, I loved when this show showcased the different parodies of popular things that happen in other genres of anime and just of clichés in general. I would be bursting out with laughter XD<br />
<br />
P.P.S. I CAN&#039;T WAIT TO WATCH THE OVAS AND SEASON TWO!

    Out of all the anime I watched this season I would probably say Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? is one of the stronger series.  The reason I decided to give the series a try is because the picture caught my attention when I was selecting anime to watch.  However I&#039;m glad that I decided to watch this series<br />
<br />
The first half of the series doesn&#039;t really follow much of a story, instead we are given some gut busting comedy to pass the time.  The comedy did actually get me to laugh a lot and I would&#039;ve had no problem if the series kept

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35498">
        going like this, but in the second half of the series a plot started to unfold. After the plot was revealed, the amount of jokes in each episode dropped to advance the more serious plot.  There was still some comedy during the second half of the series and the jokes were still funny when they came around though.<br />
<br />
The plot itself wasn&#039;t actually bad. Sometimes the plot did feel rushed because they tried to fit it in the end, and there were some plot holes.  I think it would&#039;ve been  better if they either made the plot a bit longer to let it develop more or just taken it out entirely.  It&#039;s not the best plot out there but it is interesting nonetheless and it is certainly better than some of the other plots in series that aired this season. Also putting together a good plot with gut busting comedy isn&#039;t exactly the easiest thing to do, so I think the series did a respectable job with the plot<br />
<br />
The art is actually very good, I like the character designs and the backgrounds were okay too.  The animation during the opening was awesome and you could really tell the mood by the art. I have no complaints here.<br />
<br />
The sound was alright, I enjoyed listening to the opening and ending and the voice actors did a solid job with their character. However nothing really attached to me here.<br />
<br />
When I first saw the opening and saw the different characters that were going to be in this series I thought to myself, this seems to be a strange combination of characters. However the characters were done really well.  Our main protagonist, Ayumu is a zombie is probably one of the better protagonists I&#039;ve seen mainly because he&#039;s not weak like a lot of normal Harem leads. That already is a plus and he also seems know how to act in tight situations.  We also have a very adorable female lead, Eucliwood (Eu for short) who undergoes the most development and also doesn&#039;t talk, instead she writes on a notepad. She doesn&#039;t show her emotions much but as the series goes on she begins to open up to the main protagonist. <br />
<br />
The other characters are also very likable. They don&#039;t seem to undergo much development but that&#039;s just really asking for too much from a series like this.  We have a tsundere Mahou Shoujo and 2 other Vampire Ninjas.  They do have traits of harem stereotypes but they also have qualities that makes each one of them unique.<br />
<br />
Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? is really an enjoyable series, I couldn&#039;t count the amount of times that I laughed.  Add in very lovable characters and we have ourselves a very entertaining series. If you want a good laugh I would recommend watching this<br />
<br />
Overall Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? was one of the better series of the season and although the quality of it did dip slightly toward the end I still found the series to be very good. I give it a 8/10.<br />
<br />
Thanks for Reading<br />

    I am going to start this review by stating, if you like  a serious anime this is NOT for you. Those who watched this and took everything literal can not enjoy the beauty of this anime.<br />
<br />
Now to my review. I thoroughly like that this anime is just one solid joke after another. Nothing in this anime is serious and should not be taken serious. It makes fun of all aspects anime out there, and does a good job at it. It builds up great characters that are lovable and does a decent job at putting in background story considering the anime is more of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180035">
        a feel good funny show. <br />
<br />
Personally I think if you want a good laugh this is the anime for you

    Ayumu Aikawa is a zombie resurrected by a necromancer named Eucliwood Hellscythe after being killed by a serial killer. As he tries to make the best of his un-dead life, he encounters a mashou shoujo named Haruna and accidentally takes her magic powers, being forced to become a mashou shoujo in the process. With Eucliwood, Haruna, and a vampire ninja named Seraphim living with him, Ayumu helps battle demons known as Megalos while trying to figure out the mystery behind his own death.<br />
<br />
Story &amp; Characters (5/10)<br />
After watching enough gut-busting man-eating zombie movies you start thinking that you&#039;ve seen everything that is until you saw Kore

          <span style="display: none;" id="review66785">
        wa Zombie Desu ka? (aka KoreZom). This hybrid show takes those horror stuffs into a new leap with its flashiness like a magical girl chainsawing monsters or some guy trapped in your every harem jest.<br />
<br />
Plain-looking high school student Aikawa Ayumu is a normal teenager living a boring, laid-back life with no excitement except one thing: as he&#039;s ready to tell you, he&#039;s a zombie. But how come a zombie doesn&#039;t feed on human fleshes and goes to school? That&#039;s not a long story. His life dramatically changed after being butchered by a serial killer. Luckily, a silver-haired lady necromancer by the name of Eucliwood &quot;Eu&quot; Hellscythe brought him back to life and Ayumu has entered the world of the occult since. Meanwhile, super-powered beasts wearing traditional seifuku called Megalo appeared wrecking havoc in town. Armed with a high magical (pink) chainsaw and a Cardcaptor outfit, Ayumu battles these monsters while trying to get to the bottom of things.<br />
<br />
No mistake about it, KoreZom is utterly insane and comical. We&#039;ve all seen the scene where a character selflessly jumps in front of a vehicle to save an animal or person countless times in anime, but in this case the potential hero, right before being struck, turns his head towards the screen and says: &quot;Oh, yeah, I&#039;m a zombie.&quot; Wow, that&#039;s one heck of a start and it sets a variety you couldn&#039;t expect in a show with the title &quot;zombie.&quot; Wait, maybe you could.<br />
<br />
For most part, KoreZom is purely for fun. Breath-taking humor being thrown rubbed away the disturbing gore and intense psychopath. There&#039;s chaos with zombies, vampires and the undead but the show always seems on the verge of blowing apart under the pressure of its own insanity. Characters are introduced when convenient or seemingly for the hell of it, to be killed or excised on a whim perhaps lighten the series up a little.<br />
<br />
But they don&#039;t, being a typical harem trap, the female cast have convenient moe look yet their kinds don&#039;t attract much. Eu is an expressionless bishoujo with a hidden past, Seraphim is a busty hot chick with sword and Tomonori (naturally) is the protagonist&#039;s wife. For a &quot;harem leader&quot; achertype, Ayumu can pretty stand up for himself as he can dismember without hesitant, not exactly the &quot;loser&quot; formula. Crazy, but brilliant.<br />
<br />
Art (7/10)<br />
Studio Deen, an animation studio who is famous for those bloody gore such as Higurashi and Umineko, here produces a bright and colorful effort which is hardly a paragon of action animation but loads itself up so effectively on the cute factor. Its designs are uninteresting, mainly focus on the moe standard with is trademark hairstyle, facial expression and eyes (although Eu&#039;s Gothic-moe look is a joke unto itself). Ayumu&#039;s design is even worse, you can immediately tell that he&#039;s yet again another dating heroes. Still, the utterly absurd parody of a magical girl transformation scene, complete with the sexy gasp, involving Ayumu is a hoot and the ensuing panty shots of him show that even the series&#039; fairly frequent fan-service isn&#039;t immune to parody, either. Stick with this guy a little, and you&#039;ll see tons of crazy stuffs around him including his pervy delusion and &quot;man-service.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah right, because the title has the word zombie, there are expectations of violence. And speaking of violence, what is better than those moments full of all the decapitation, amputation and disemboweling that even the most juvenile of gore-hounds could desire.<br />
<br />
Sound (7/10)<br />
Casting features some familiar faces, giving KoreZom a bit of familiarity shared by its genre. Majima Junji again voices a colorless nice guy, while others such as Haruna or Seraphim&#039;s manage to give the show pushes with their cutie tsundere tones.<br />
<br />
The synthesizer-heavy musical score mixes some cheesy themes in with cutesy themes, an occasional mildly dramatic one, and themes which sound like they were directly borrowed from an ero game for an overall effect that is energetic but unimpressive. The same goes for OP &quot;Ma?Ka?Se?Te Tonight&quot; sung by Eu&#039;s seiyuu, a somewhat cute and spiritual the show has, and ED which composed with a highly enthusiastic male-female dual with the lead characters performing some new kind of caramelldansen in the background.<br />
<br />
Overall (6/10)<br />
Accept KoreZom for what it is – a simple cutesy fan-service show – and it can be quite entertaining. However, those who finished the show would find it quite disappointing. The plot is divided into two parts with little relation to each other: the first part is about the search for the mystery behind the murders while the second revolves Eu&#039;s past. But what more of an utter disappointment is how the producers turn the last episode into a mindless silly gag created for fan-service. There&#039;s still the OVA (or perhaps a sequel) to talk about, but I highly doubt they will continue the left-opened story. Just wait to see what other tricks they have up their sleeves. You will find lots of laughter here, depth probably not, but really, what can you expect in a series that has a guy wearing women&#039;s clothing as demon fighter?<br />
<br />
Good:<br />
+ An entertaining, breath-taking humor take on demon-fighting cliches.<br />
+ Ayumu is kind of manly for his achertype.<br />
<br />
Bad:<br />
+ Ridiculous villains.<br />
+ Last episode is a cheap trick.

    ZOMBIES!!! One almost immediately thinks of flesh-eating, mindless, corrupted humans when he hears this word. It also brings to mind gore and blood spilling! Today, the &quot;zombie&quot; genre is very widespread, so it no wonder that Japan has already opened its doors to it. <br />
<br />
There have already been other &quot;zombie&quot; anime that have been made, namely HOTD and the like. But unlike its other companions, Kore wa Zombie Desu ka is... unique! <br />
<br />
Kore wa Zombie is a hilarious anime that will most likely leave you gasping for air in every episode. It&#039;s a fun, worry-free, and not-so-serious anime. But as a &quot;zombie&quot; anime, it is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review63315">
        guaranteed to have lots of blood and gore to satisfy its fans.  But don&#039;t worry. The &quot;blood-gore&quot; level isn&#039;t that bad. So people with weak constitutions can watch it without worry. Although what you should be afraid of is the moments where one might lack oxygen due to laughing too much. It even has a touch of harem to boot!<br />
<br />
The art is pretty good. But it&#039;s not that note-worthy since almost all 2011-2012 anime use the same type of technique. It&#039;s all pretty balanced. But I&#039;m pretty sure you won&#039;t be pausing to look at the artwork, since its pretty fair.<br />
<br />
The OP and ED both sound pretty nice. And they have great Seiyuus to boot too. Once again, all of them totally fit their characters... Well all except maybe Hellscythe-dono. I&#039;ve noticed that her voice changes in several episodes, and it&#039;s bothered me a bit, but it&#039;s nothing serious.<br />
<br />
All in all, Kore wa Zombie is definitely a must watch! Guaranteed to satisfy all your hilarity needs. Warning: when asthmatic, please make sure you have your asthma attack spray ready, just in case of emergencies. (b&gt;w
