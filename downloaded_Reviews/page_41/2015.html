Cute Girls learning to overcome their problems and flourish as true manga artists by bonding, having fun and living the life of a high school girl as they confront their struggles together as friends and fellow professionals. <br />
<br />
Based off a popular 4 panel manga of the same name Comic Girls is a comedy and slice of life anime that gives us the rare opportunity

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281757">
        to see what the life of an aspiring manga artist is like and the kind of struggles that they have to face as they try to balance their personal lives with their professional careers. The first episode of the series made a pretty good impression on me and did a great job of hooking me as I was curious to see whether Kao’s would be able to fit in a dorm and live alongside fellow manga artists her age and learn from them to save her career as a manga artist over a period of just one year. I&#039;m glad that I decided to watch the series right to the end as it was a series that I really enjoyed watching.<br />
<br />
Taking place in modern day Japan the overall story of Comic Girls follows the life of Kaoruko Moeta a shy and timid high school girl and aspiring manga artist that thanks to a series of disastrous manga sales is forced to attend a well-known manga dorm for female manga artists in an effort to improve her manga drawing skills. At the dorm, she meets a number of fellow manga artists who while working in different genres of manga all share a passion for manga that Kao’s can relate too. These include the kind and older sister like Ruki, the energetic and positive Koyume, the tomboyish but confident Tsubasa and the quiet and eccentric but surprisingly understanding Fura. As Kaoruko lives and interacts with this colourful cast at the dorm and at school Kaoruko would soon learn that being a manga artist is not just about trying to imagine an idea that you have never encountered or experienced before but rather its about drawing in ideas that you yourself have enjoyed doing with the friends that you have befriended and bonded with. One cannot draw a manga until they have experienced the scenes that they want to draw with their friends. <br />
<br />
Kaoruko <br />
<br />
Kaoruko played by new seiyuu Hikaru Akao in her first main role as a seiyuu is one of the main characters of the series and is the series main protagonist. A high school girl and an aspiring manga artist at the beginning of the series Kaoruko better known as her pen name Kaos was a nervous and mentally fragile girl that had very low self-esteem and was very weak to any form of pressure. While passionate towards manga and a relatively hard worker Kaos was hampered greatly by the fact that she has yet to experience the scenes that she draws in her manga panels which ended up causing quite the negative feedback from her readers as to them her scenes were unrealistic. As a result of this Kaos was given the opportunity to move to a female dorm designed specifically to allow female manga artists to focus and improve their skills. As a result of her low self-esteem and nervousness, Kaos at the beginning of the series had some trouble fitting in at the dorm and had great trouble in befriending her fellow manga artists who were the same age as she was due to the fact that until now few people had been nice to her. In line with this fear is Kao’s belief that she is merely a background character when compared to the results that have been secured by others the same age as her. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on, however, Kao&#039;s personality gradually changes as a result of her new-found friendships and bonds with her fellow manga artists and dorm mates. As a result of being able to not just form friendships but also experience the very actions that she will need to draw within her manga panels Kaos was able to realise that no manga artist is ever alone and that the best way to improve your skills as a manga artist is to first improve yourself and secondly experience the very events that you are drawing into your manga by living a life as an actual high school girl. While still nervous and timid to a degree Kaos becomes determined to change herself and live the life that she had been missing and draw what she experiences into her manga. While Kaos in the beginning of the series was hesitant about helping her seniors within the dorm as a result of her determination to improve herself this fear of the unknown gradually vanishes and she becomes more earnest and willing to help others as well as developing an interest into finding out why someone is acting the way that they are with this latter one being more prevalent in her interactions with the dorms resident horror manga artist Fura. The character of Kaos I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed. Seeing Kaos transform from a quiet and meek girl that knew nothing about what an actual high school girl’s life is like to one that was determined to live the life of one and use the memories that she makes with her friends to improve her skills as a manga artist I thought was one of the best things about her character. I felt that her seiyuu Hikaru Akao really did an excellent job of portraying the character of Kaos. <br />
<br />
Ruki <br />
<br />
Ruki voiced by veteran seiyuu Saori Oonishi of Food wars and Clockwork planet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Kao’s fellow dorm mates. A high school freshman and classmate of Kaos Ruki, unlike Kaos, is an established manga artist with her genre being teens love. A confident, imaginative and positive young woman Ruki is someone that easily fits the image of an older sister being not just kind and considerate towards her juniors but also perceptive enough to notice when something is bothering them. As an experienced manga artist Ruki knows very well the types of challenges that aspiring manga artists face as they try to break into the industry and make their mark on it and as a result while hardworking and earnest tries hard to create the perfect balance between her personal life and her pro career all the while watching over and encouraging her kohai’s. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on and as Ruki’s character gets expanded upon it can be seen that Ruki also has a fair share of struggles that she has to deal with. While an experienced manga artist that has already established her place within the manga industry it can be seen that Ruki has mixed feelings about this. While happy that she has managed to establish a career in a field that she is interested in it can be seen that Ruki is somewhat embarrassed about the way people see her due to the fact that she’s an ero manga artist which isn’t helped by the fact that for whatever reason people often see her actions as being of the lewd nature even if she did not mean it to be so. A fact that I felt was hilarious as it contrasted with Ruki’s usually composed attitude. In line with this is Ruki’s complex in that she is conscious of the fact that her fans would imagine her as someone that is sexy and mature when she herself is not. As a result of this fear Ruki is shown to be wary of meeting new people and would go to great lengths to stop people from seeing her work on her manga due to both her embarrassment at having others see her work and at seeing the doubts that she has regarding whether this genre is really the one that she wants to be known for. As a result of these fears Ruki was shown to have a very deep fear of book signings as she was conscious of the reactions of her fans to her actual physical appearance an aspect of her that I really liked as it showed that no matter how skilled one was at writing and drawing the person behind that can be someone that’s far from what one can imagine their favourite author to be. As a character, I felt that Ruki was one that was well designed and developed with her many fears and embarrassments contrasting well with her usual calm and mature self. The older sister like personality that she exhibited I felt helped greatly in allowing her juniors to overcome the fear and struggles that they faced in making their first marks on their careers. I felt that her seiyuu Saori Oonishi really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Ruki. <br />
<br />
Tsubasa <br />
<br />
Tsubasa voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Rie Takahashi of Re Zero and Konosuba fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Kao’s fellow dorm mates. A high school freshman and a classmate of Kaos Tsubasa is unlike Kaos and Koyume an established manga artist with her speciality being a Shonen manga artist. A hardworking, positive and kind person by nature Tsubasa is someone that while quiet is someone that is friendly and kind to everyone that she meets whether they are juniors or adults. A confident and steadfast person by nature Tsubasa on initial appearance can easily be mistaken for a boy due to the fact that she insists on adapting the guise of a tomboy to hide her true identity from her friends and schoolmates. As a result of this Tsubasa is seen by many of her fellow schoolmates as someone that is cool, focused and calm something that she really appreciates as she feels that her normal self does not fit the image of her chosen speciality. While being less skilled with words than her fellow manga artist Ruki Tsubasa is shown to be someone that doesn’t mince words and is someone that can be quite direct with her praise and is always willing to offer her honest opinion on something when asked for advice by others. Despite being only a high school girl Tsubasa is shown to be someone that’s mature for her age and can easily take control of situations easily someone that I really like about her character. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on Tsubasa’s personality and character starts to gradually change as she interacts with her friends and fellow manga artists. While a quiet person by nature as the series goes on it can be seen that Tsubasa is someone that can get really focused into her work to the point where she can actually transform into the main character of her manga via the use of cosplay a fact that I found to be really hilarious. While having a well known and popular series can often make people arrogant this is not true for Tsubasa who seems to be fine with just being able to draw manga to her heart&#039;s content showing how humble she is regarding her profession. This aspect of her goes well with Tsubasa’s core belief that only by drawing the best you can, can you get closer to the idea that you want. A prominent trait of Tsubasa’s character is her insistence on adopting a tomboy persona that stems from the belief that her true appearance and the one that she adapts when going back home is unsuitable and not fitting the image of her speciality. While very determined to maintain her cool and mature tomboyish side to her fans and friends this feeling gradually changes as a result of Koyume’s actions that cause her to regain some of her girly spirit.  The character of Tsubasa I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with the constant transformation into her manga’s main character via the use of cosplay and the hilarity that this ensures being one of the best aspects of her character. Additionally, the struggle that Tsubasa has with her family and the decision to adopt an entirely new persona to allow her to better fit in her manga speciality I felt was well done and showed how determined Tsubasa was to make a name for herself in the manga world with or without her family’s support. I felt that her seiyuu Rie Takahashi really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Tsubasa.<br />
<br />
Koyume <br />
<br />
Koyume voiced by veteran seiyuu Kaede Hondo of Battle Girls High school and Girlish Number fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Kao’s fellow dorm mates. A high school freshman and schoolmate of Kaos Koyume like Kaos is an aspiring manga artist that while new already has a lot of experience in the industry due to her willingness to learn. A carefree, confident and positive girl by nature Koyume is someone that can freely fit into any environment that she enters whether it’s a new school or a new dorm due to her positive, friendly and caring nature. An intelligent and fast thinking person by nature Koyume though still a new artist approaches her work as a shojo manga artist with both determination and passion aspiring to be a successful manga artist within the field like her fellow dorm mates. While having a vivid imagination Koyume at the beginning of the series had great trouble drawing material for her manga due to a lack of knowledge on romance matters. As a result of this at the beginning of the series, she like Kaos were in a state where they were forced to find new inspiration to improve their skills. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on and Koyume’s character and personality gets expanded upon it can be seen that while confident and positive Koyume is someone that can easily get embarrassed and lose her normal composure which is best shown when discussing matters related to romance and her relationship and admiration of her fellow manga artist and friend Tsubasa. This latter interest in Tsubasa as a romantic partner is also used as a running gag within the series as Koyume has a habit of picturing her as the male in her manga stories to her embarrassment and the amusement of her friends. While possessing boundless optimism and faith in her skills as a manga artist Koyume can become discouraged if people don’t like her work but this latter part is offset by the fact that her happy and go lucky attitude always enables her to return back from the brink more energised and determined than before. The character of Koyume I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with her ability to stay positive and energetic at all times to offset Kao&#039;s sudden mood swings being the best aspects of her character. Additionally, her ability to come up with random ideas and expand them into crazy scenarios I thought was something that matched well with her personality. Her romantic interest into Tsubasa was also an aspect that I liked as it allowed us to see Koyume in a rare sight of panicking in embarrassment of having a secret found out. I felt that her seiyuu Kaede Hondo did an excellent job at portraying the character of Koyume. <br />
<br />
Suzu Fura<br />
<br />
Suzu Fura voiced by veteran seiyuu Reina Ueda of Relife fame is one of the main support characters of the series. A fellow manga artist and dorm mate of the girls Suzu Fura who is often called Fura sensei by the girls due to her experience is a quiet, isolated and awkward person by nature that seemingly prefers to stay within her room instead of socialising with her fellow dorm mates. A horror manga artist by trade Fura due to her awkwardness and lack of social skills is someone that has few friends in her life due to her scary nature that causes people to avoid her. As a result of this Fura often spends long periods of time in isolation creating material for her manga. As a result of this isolation, her first meeting with Kaos was about as much as a shock for her as it was for Kaos. In line with her isolation and her speciality as a horror manga artist Fura adapts a very distinctive physical appearance of white clothing that contrasts well with her dark hair that covers her eyes. An outfit that I thought suits both her chosen field and her personality of loving to hear others scream in terror really well. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on and Fura’s personality and character gets expanded upon it can be seen that Fura while a scary and somewhat unsettling person to be near is actually someone that is incredibly lonely due to her lack of friends. As a result of this loneliness Fura often compensates by acting overly friendly with people that she knows trying hard to savour the warmth that comes from being near people that she’s familiar with which is best shown in the strong bonds that she manages to establish with Kaos despite the latter’s initial fear of her. As a result of her awkwardness around people, it can be seen that Fura has a great deal of difficulty interacting with people that she’s not familiar with and as a result can easily misunderstand their actions. Because of this personality, Fura is someone that is unused to people being kind to her and as a result, she holds people that do so in very high regard counting them as one of her dear friends. When relaxed and in an environment that suits her though it can be seen that Fura reverts back to her normal personality that she keeps hidden behind her scary one a personality that contrasts a great deal with her usual one. Instead of being scary and awkward around people in this personality Fura is instead a kind, attentive and patient person that can be surprisingly talkative and is a very capable teacher that uses both jokes and scares to allow her students to concentrate more on their work a far cry from her default persona. As a character, I felt that the character of Fura was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with the contrast between her two personalities and her gradual opening of her heart to others as she bonds with and befriends her fellow manga artists and dorm mates being the best aspects of her character. I felt that her seiyuu Reina Ueda really did a fantastic job of portraying the character of Fura.  <br />
<br />
AMV <br />
<br />
Animation wise I thought that the dorm that the main cast live and work at and the school that they attend as students were very well designed and did a great job of showing that a manga artist is able to work from anywhere as long as they have the creative resources that they need to create their work. The character designs for the characters whether for the main cast or the supporting cast I felt was well designed and matched well with the personalities of each character. The inclusion of manga setting scenes to illustrate individual scenes within the anime I thought was also well designed and matched well with the theme of manga creation. In terms of music, I really liked the series OST as it matched well with the many different emotions and feelings that the cast experience in each scene. The opening and ending themes for the series which was Memories and Namida wa Misenai which was sung by the series main cast I felt was pretty good with both conveying a cheerful and positive mood to the listener and matching well with the series main theme. In terms of voice acting, I felt that each member of the voice cast was able to do an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I feel that Hikaru Akao, Saori Oonishi, Rie Takahashi, Kaede Hondo and Reina Ueda who portrayed the characters of Kaos, Ruki, Tsubasa, Koyume and Fura all deserve special praise as I felt that they all did a fantastic job at portraying their assigned characters. In addition, though I didn’t cover the members of the supporting cast I also felt that Aya Endo, Minami Tsuda and Ayaka Nanase who portrayed the characters of Ririka the dorms matron, Mayu Kao&#039;s editor and Miharu who was the homeroom teacher of Kao&#039;s class all deserve special mention as I felt that they did an excellent job of supporting the main cast in this series.<br />
<br />
Overall conclusion <br />
Overall Comic girls was a series that I really enjoyed watching and had among its strong points an interesting premise, an excellent story, interesting and well-developed characters, strong voice acting and its inclusion of real-world issues into the professional lives of the girls. <br />
<br />
The premise of the show I felt was an interesting one as unlike seiyuu’s and the making of anime the creation of manga and what the life of a manga artist actually is like is something that is largely unknown to us. Unlike anime and seiyuu’s the age of a manga artist is hard to ascertain because as human beings our skills and our innate talents at a particular action manifest at different times and as a result it’s perhaps not unusual to have talented manga artists to actually be high school freshman instead of say young adults that had just entered society. However, as a result of this unique premise of having the main cast as high school girls, we are also presented with an opportunity to see the types of problems that both manga artists and teenagers such as the members of the main cast face. This combination of having the main cast experience not just the problems that they face in their professional lives such as the dreaded slump that many a manga artist and light novel author has felt as well as more personal problems like being afraid of attending book signings for your work due to being afraid of what your fans would feel at seeing your actual physical appearance I felt was well done as it allowed us to see the kind of problems both personal and professional that manga artists can feel as they both start and maintain their careers in the field of manga. <br />
<br />
The overall story of the show I felt was also a strong point of the series as not only did it allow us to see the members of the main cast develop both as individuals and as manga artists but also allow us to see them doing so as they work alongside each other, bond with each other, have fun together and overcome problems together while at the same time not forgetting that at the end of the day they while professionals in their own right are still high school girls that are just at the beginning of their lives. Paired with this story is the strong chemistry that is established between Kaos and not just with her fellow manga artists but also with the many support staff that helps them in their everyday lives whether as high school students or as manga professionals. This chemistry when paired with the story is what really makes the story stand out as this allows us to see Kaos and the girls gradually mature as the series goes on both as individuals and as manga artists as they incorporate what they had learned from bonding with their friends into their work and improve not only themselves but also the work that they so cherish. One of the main themes of the series is, of course, the act of overcoming doubts and improving yourself to break your limits a theme that I felt was really appropriate for the series and handled really well within the series through the evolution of Kaos and the girls not just as manga artists but as individuals as well. Overall Comic girls was a series that I really enjoyed with its premise, story and the chemistry between its cast being the highlight of the series. As a final score, I would say that Comic girls would easily deserve a final score of 10/10 and is easily one of the best animes i seen this season. <br />

    A few years ago, I asked myself if we’ll ever get another series about characters making manga. Series like Bakuman and Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun are among some of the most entertaining anime I’ve seen that explored such ideas. In recent years, we had series about cute girls making games like New Game! or even characters working in the anime industry like Shirobako. Now it’s 2018 and we got Comic Girls. <br />
<br />
I’ll say right off the bat that the series is about as simple as it sounds. It’s an anime that explores the daily life misadventures of a group of female mangaka. For a series that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281753">
        deals with such a simple premise, the way it executes its storytelling is just as effective. At its core, the show uses its character cast to do the storytelling. Every day is an adventure of its own as we see how these characters interact and behave. In essence, the series provides the opportunity to showcase manga making in a very casual, everyday life environment.<br />
<br />
Our main characters consists of a group of young girls of similar age. They have nicknames and all have them different preferences in their manga tastes. For instance, Koyume prefer shoujo manga compared to other genres. Ruki loves ecchi and fan service in her work. Tsubasa’s passion for shounen manga is also reflected in personality. Then, there’s Kaoruko Moeta (Kaos) who just wants to improve herself as a manga artist after having her work met with overwhelming negative reception. The main selling point is how these characters are motivated to do what they love through their connections with each other. <br />
<br />
As a fan of the manga, the adaptation is relatively faithful and brings the mood of the series to life. The lighthearted tone of every episode is what you can expect from most “cute girls doing cute things” shows. Now I’ll be honest with you. If this type of show isn’t what you’re familiar with or a fan of, then it may be hard to enjoy this. There’s not much character development despite the series exploring a life journey of these young mangaka. Storytelling on most parts is very simple and doesn’t get any complicated as time goes on. Every episode has a repetitive nature and it feels like if you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all. There are some characters the series brings in that occasionally spark more popcorn entertainment such as horror mangaka Suzu Fuura, Tsubasa’s shounen style cosplays, and various misunderstandings. However, don’t expect this series to be one that’s dramatic or even competitive. In fact, the show is hardly about competition when it comes to manga craft but instead about characters working to improve themselves. The comedy is presented through reactions, character interactions, characters’ behaviors. There’s not much characterization although we do see some of the family backgrounds of the cast. In retrospect, these characters are pretty easy to understand along with the show itself.<br />
<br />
Nexus is a studio that’s probably known for its 2015’s anime adaptation, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry. While this series is nowhere near on that level of fan service, it still contains fan service and skinship. It’s mainly mild and nothing too distracting. In some places, it’s necessary as one of the mangaka wants to improve her skill of making “teenage love” manga. On a technical level, the series looks crisp with colorful quality and cute character designs. The series never hides Kao’s shyness or Tsubasa’s tomboy tendencies. Suzu Fuura and her mischievous personality is also animated with such intention. The series’ character designs may also be misleading at times as such characters look older than they seem. Luckily, it doesn’t hold them back as every characters’ voice fits well with their persona. The theme songs for the show overall also contains the style of what slice of life should be with mangaka theatrics. <br />
<br />
Comic Girls, the series about mangaka striving to improve their craft did what it needed to do and I didn’t expect anything more. It’s a simple series that capitalized on the chance to explore mangaka lifestyle. It succeeds doing that through the storytelling and can even occasionally surprise you. But if you’re not a fan of this type of series, then it may be hard to look back and enjoy what it is. Still, give the show a chance and see what awaits you on the other side.<br />

    The cute girls genre recieves a fantastic addition with Comic Girls, an anime I definitely didn&#039;t expect to be as good as it ended up being.<br />
<br />
This story is focused on a group of girls who love manga and either draw one professionally, or are trying to get a series published. This proves to be difficult for our lovable protagonist, Kaos, who honestly is just awful at it, and goes to live in a dormitory for female manga artists where she meets the other main characters of the series, hopefully getting inspiration from them.<br />
<br />
Comic Girls uses the setting really well to provide a fantastic comedy both

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281756">
        via the characters and the use of the manga elements. This anime doesn&#039;t focus on the profession like series as Bakuman or Shirobako do, but it&#039;s still quite informative and, most importantly, succeeds at using it for the comedic value it wants.<br />
<br />
There are four main characters in this story: our protagonist, Kaoruko Moeta (pen-name Kaos), who is an absurdly likeable and quite relatable girl who seems to be in constant state of panic, but is also a hard worker that you will want to adopt and protect, Tsubasa, a tomboyish girl who draws shounen manga and puts herself really seriously in the mind of the characters she creates, Ruki, who loves drawing cute things but ended up discovering her true skills at drawing lewd stuff instead to her embarassment, and Koyume, a cheerful shoujo manga artist and doughnut devourer who can&#039;t draw guys. Their personalities balance well and make for a lot of entertaining situations, and together with fantastic (and also quite touching at times) episodes focused on each character I ended up very attached to them. The number of secondary characters is pretty short but they do well when they appear and add to the fun that comes from this anime.<br />
<br />
The art style and character designs of the series are very visually appealing, with lots of nice character reactions and well done use of the camera angles, studio Nexus hasn&#039;t done many things yet but I would be totally in for them doing more series in the future because they never fail to deliver in terms of quality. The music on the other side is nothing memorable but fits well for the tone of the scenes, the opening and ending themes are two good songs by the VAs of the four protagonists, with the later having some really nice transitions into it at the end of some episodes.<br />
<br />
Comic Girls is a fantastic series I enjoyed a lot and I really recommend to watch to any fan of the cute girls genre, or for anyone looking for a comedy series to watch, because this one delivers hard.<br />

    Comic Girls fits in an interesting spot for CGDCT shows. While there is an abundance of CGDCT that manage to have nice light fluffy interactions but with little depth, it s rare to see a show like Comic Girls where the depth of the show is the highlight. With Comic Girls there is a lot of depth given to the characters, who they are, what they&#039;re aiming for, and the growth that they have as comic artists. While the characters do have their gimmicks and can seem a bit cliche at the start. There is much more to them than that. One thing I appreciate

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281750">
        is that they all seem to be modeled off the genre of manga that they are writing. Koyume acts like a shoujo protagonist. Tsubasa acts like a shounen protagonist. Moeta acts like a combination between the typical CGDCT protagonist and its audience. While it does lead them to be more prototypical than they could be it also creates and interesting and humorous meta joke.<br />
<br />
By itself that is nice but nothing special, but what is great is how it&#039;s used for their development and how their depth gets explored due to that. With Koyume, the shoujo mangaka, an empathsis on love is brought into her character arc, including her learning how it feels to actually be in love and the feelings that she has. With Ruki, a josei ecchi mangaka, she learns how to love herself and what she does even those it may seem shameful or something not to be proud of. With Moeta, the CGDCT mangaka, she learns how to have friends and be accepted by them as well as how to deal with all of her self-esteem issues. They all have issues that bring them to be more than just the meta archetypes that they start with. It makes them compelling as characters and their successes that much more satisfying.<br />
<br />
Another interesting point in Comic Girls&#039; depth is its yuri. While a lot of CGDCT like to do hints at yuri and make soft yuri ships, Comic Girls goes beyond that. There are explicit statements of love towards other girls as well as focus on those feelings. They aren&#039;t treated as a joke but rather with power and focus. Not only that but they&#039;re not content to just show it and have the fandom supply the rest. Comic Girls actually shows reasons why the two characters would fit together well, why they like each other, and how each other improves each other&#039;s lives. With a lot of romances it often feels like the main point is a statement of the characters being in love with each other rather than a focus on what makes them so good together. Comic Girls&#039; eschews that by showing how the two help each other, and why they like each other. It makes for a very satisfying romance, when many other CGDCT only teased at one.<br />
<br />
Interestingly while Comic Girls manages to handle its depth well it does have an issue with it&#039;s more SOL moments. While these are usually the bread and butter of CGDCT shows, and is the easier parts for a show to do Comic Girls&#039; SOL moments are pretty generic and standard. While the chemistry that the cast has goes a long way, the gimmicks are relied on a lot, and in general the jokes are nothing special, especially when compared to the large library of CGDCT works. Too often overused jokes are made, or the same material is riffed on over and over again.<br />
<br />
That said I feel like the characters, and the great depthful moments more than make up for that. The art is also quite nice and the general finished product is a good one although not a spectacular one. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day I&#039;d say Comic Girls is a really good CGDCT and one that any fan of CGDCT should happily pick up. It may not have the strongest jokes or fluff, but the overall combination of material is great.

    Comic Girls was a pleasant surprise. I was a bit worried at the beginning of episode one when the show cut between a manga author and editor. I assumed it would be similar to Bakuman, a show I wasn&#039;t very fond of. Luckily, the show takes a unique turn in showing the daily lives of well-known manga author roommates instead of aspiring manga authors still living with their parents. The show is well designed, with care put into the backgrounds as well as the character designs. Each girl has a unique and rounded personality, separating them from tropes associated with the slice of life genre.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279444">
        Situations these characters are put into for humor are far different from most comedy anime, making for great some jokes. These girls also love their jobs more than anything, and are as much fans of the manga medium as they authors and artists. You can see the characters bond over this common interest, despite each girl&#039;s writing style being completely different and being at different stages in their careers. My only real gripe with this show other than the start of the first episode is putting all of these girls in school. Fortunately, the characters don&#039;t stay there long and both the girl&#039;s preparation for school and the school&#039;s design are very creative. I&#039;m just a bit frustrated that this show couldn&#039;t just be about the lives of adults working creative jobs. Other than those very minor problems, this show was surprisingly entertaining. I&#039;d recommend this to any manga fan or anyone looking for a slice of life comedy to fill their time.

    To be honest, I really enjoy Shoujo manga/anime. And yes this anime very enjoyable. The story is telling us about shoujo mangakas (girls making manga) daily live. For someone loves shoujo manga can already imagine core of this anime, girl&#039;s life.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10<br />
I know shoujo manga/anime sometime can be so bored cuz many of them only focus on &#039;moe-moe&#039; and do any plot to make character more &#039;moe-moe&#039;. In this anime, yes still moe is important dishes, but the story, shoujo mangaka is a good one. Not so tasteless, but there&#039;s some crisp on it.<br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
Yes, this about moe. Shoujo anime must be moe! Definitely! And

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279178">
        the background effect is pretty good I think. Animation just soso, no battle scene, nothing must be noticeable.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10)<br />
Moe voice? Yes please! Some of seiyuu (voice actor) already popular. But one of the main characters is a fresh one. But still, very nice.<br />
<br />
Character (8/10)<br />
Unique personality for each character is very good! And it makes a daily life joke which very enjoyable and crisp.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9/10)<br />
Actually I want to give it 10/10. But I&#039;m a big fan of shoujo manga/anime, so let&#039;s just minus one it. If you love moe character, scene full of woman, just dive in! If you want some lite story and enjoyable, just put your ass down and start watching.<br />
<br />
Overall (8/10)<br />
It&#039;s a good anime to relax with. If you still consider it, just imagine a world of moe where you can watch all of moe interact with each other with a different moe personality. It&#039;s about MOE!

    Comic Girls is one of the most overlooked shows of the Spring 2018 season. At the time of this writing, it ranks in as the #16 new TV series of the season on MAL based on the number of members attached to it. I’m sure that a large part of this is due to many “serious” anime fans dismissing moe, slice of life, cute girls doing cute things (CGDCT) shows on reflex. But I feel that this show deserves much more recognition than its getting, not just from slice of life fans, but from anime fans in general.<br />
<br />
Comic Girls is part of the “cute girls

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282811">
        + activity” sub-genre of CGDCT shows which K-ON! largely brought into style. In this show, the activity that these cute girls are taking part in is creating manga. While the series doesn’t go as deep into manga production as a series like Bakuman, drawing manga is definitely a more significant part of the story than the music in K-ON! and the activities of many other shows of this type. If you are interested in how manga is made but felt that Bakuman was a little too dry (and if you think it could be improved by cute girls), then this might be a great alternative for you.<br />
<br />
So let’s go ahead and get into my category breakouts:<br />
<br />
-----Story - 9 out of 10-----<br />
The story centers around four girls as they work on their respective (individual) manga careers in a dormitory specifically set up for young manga artists. The story mainly focuses on Kaos-sensei, a very small high school girl who gets sent to the dorm by her editor when she’s having trouble producing anything good. She had a debut one-shot manga published which wasn’t particularly well received. She joins two established manga artists who both have ongoing series in serialization as well as a fellow newcomer. Being that this is largely a true slice of life series in form, not much in the way of actual “plot” goes on. Most of the story revolves around Kaos sucking, the other girls working and dealing with their production schedules, or just regular old everyday life stuff. However, in the context of the kind of story that is being told, it’s all rather well done. The comedy is well-paced with tight delivery and there is a steady stream of heartfelt moments. There are a few spots that are a little slower than they really needed to be (the final episode or two comes to mind), but the payoff was almost always worth it.<br />
<br />
-----Art - 9 out of 10-----<br />
True slice of life shows tend to be some of the least demanding in the art department. There are usually no grand landscapes or crazy effects or action sequences. However, Comic Girls still does a rather exceptional job in this regard. To go along with the manga theme, the art direction of the series tends to have a heavily manga-inspired look with cool cuts and panel-windows inserted on the screen. It works very well and the overall look of the series is fun and clean. They also don’t cut any corners when it comes to the presentation of the different girls’ manga art as they all have their own distinct styles. The animation of their manga production is also very good, showing both traditional and digital production in natural and believable ways. The cuts to drawing manga never looks bad and never breaks immersion.<br />
<br />
-----Sound - 9 out of 10-----<br />
The sound direction for Comic Girls is rather solid. The opening and ending theme songs are good and the score is nice. But where these kinds of shows really need to shine is in the voice acting and Comic Girls does not disappoint. All of the characters are voiced with feeling and they all seem to fit the characters well. You really sense the excitement when the girls are talking about their passions as well as how down they feel when something isn’t going quite right. It is all just very well done.<br />
<br />
-----Characters - 10 out of 10-----<br />
The success of slice of life and especially CGDCT shows absolutely hinges on their characters. Luckily, the characters in this series and their interactions with each other are all just wonderful! From the moment that we see Kaos, her weird small cuteness is evident, emphasized with her almost comical ability to attract animals. Koyume’s peppy airheaded nature is a lot of fun to watch as is her love for another character.... Tsubasa’s passion for her long-running shounen manga is exciting and funny to watch at the same time and it makes her sparse moments of distress all the more amusing. Then Ruki’s concern over making a series in a genre that she is embarrassed by (smut) and not really fitting the image of someone you’d expect to write such things (being an inexperienced high school girl with an unimpressive figure) causes her much more stress than it should while she is still able to maintain the status of being the most mature and well-put-together of the main four. The series also has a great supporting cast with very fun adults and a fifth girl who is one year older than the rest and not seen much because of “reasons”. The characters are truly all great fun and if you connect with them, it will make the series for you.<br />
<br />
-----Enjoyment - 10 out of 10-----<br />
I loved this series. Despite some minor pacing issues and maybe not going into enough detail with some of the story elements than it could have, everything just worked for me in the end. As I score based purely on enjoyment, this did end up getting a 10 from me on my personal list. Other than just getting immersed in the lives of these girls, I was also able to relate to a lot of the art elements as someone who did draw regularly in the past (especially in high school). While they don’t go particularly deep into the production of manga, I feel that there is enough here for anyone who has ever attempted to draw in any serious or semi-serious fashion to relate to. Early on the girls talk about things that they are just not very good at drawing and there are also instances of procrastination and just not knowing what to draw. While there are a lot of funny moments in the series, it also feels genuine, coming from a place of love and not just being some cash-in or purely an advertisement for the source manga.<br />
<br />
-----Overall - 9 out of 10 (Conclusion)-----<br />
Well, in case it isn’t clear already, I think this series is great. While it does stumble at times, I feel that everything else in the series makes up for it. If you enjoy this kind of show, it is definitely worth seeing. Let yourself get taken in by the characters and laugh and cry and smile ear-to-ear like an idiot. Now, would this be enough to convert the “serious” anime fans to the joys of CGDCT? Eh, probably not; they’ll most likely have their minds made up going in and not be able to see this as anything but the pointless moe dribble that is RUINING ANIME!! But for anyone else who can just let themselves watch something nice without any kind of earth-shattering plot, keep an open mind, and enjoy the lives of some cute girls, then you shouldn’t be disappointed, especially if you’ve ever enjoyed creating art of your own.

    I feel this anime really appeals to me as an artist. As an artist in high school myself, I feel I have some girls to relate to. I&#039;ve wanted to try making my own manga, and now this anime seems to be teaching me some techniques that I will use.<br />
<br />
Story 6/10:<br />
 The story overall isn&#039;t fantastic, but that kind of is the point! Kaoroku Moeta (or Kaos-chan) is a high school student who is a struggling artist. She moves into a dormitory for other female mangaka to get inspiration and learn new techniques and get a serialized manga. The anime follows Kaos and her new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280089">
        friends Konome (a shoujo artist who can&#039;t draw male characters), Tsubasa (a shonen mangaka who got her first series published and has a bit of a tendency to imitate her characters), and Rukki (a hentai artist who wants to draw kids manga) on their daily lives juggling school, serialized manga, fans, self-esteem issues, and improving drawing skills. It&#039;s meant to focus on the little things, as this is also a comedy anime. <br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
The art is important in a show on this topic, and Comic Girls delivers in that. Characters look distinct, have various facial expressions, and personality shown in their movements. Some side characters like animals even have this established (Nyaos is a prime example). All drawings shown that are created by the girls are well done (even the intentionally bad ones, as they are used for comedy making them good for their job), and some of the techniques used can easily be replicated. (DM me with some tips as I am trying to make my own manga too lol)<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
All characters have fitting voices. The actors all do a really good job. Shoutouts to Takahashi Rie, the actor of Tsubasa, as this tone she uses is different to how I last heard her voice in a anime (Takagi San). The OPs and EDs also have good musical composition. Every time a character appears on screen in the OP or ED, their voice is heard singing (I&#039;m imagining this with JOJO as Ono Daisuke tried to sing the OP and failed hilariously.) All these actresses are amazing at their job in singing and acting. It is so weird tho hearing Takahashi sing in character as she usually doesn&#039;t sing in the more monotone voice. Also the action music that plays with Tsubasa&#039;s impersonations is hilarious.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
These characters are so relatable to me.<br />
<br />
Kaos: Young struggling mangaka who can&#039;t draw well. She is also shy and easily scared. Also she openly is a bit homosexual lmao. (Reminds me of a younger me)<br />
<br />
Konome: Kaos&#039; best friend. She is energetic and this bounces off well with Kaos. A sort of Ryuji-Akira sort of vibe, in where they are so different but they like each other and support each other type of thing. Konome draws shoujo manga, but can&#039;t draw male characters. (Tbh i have a similar problem due to my art style). Her bubbly personality reminds me of myself.<br />
<br />
Tsubasa: MY WAIFU. SHE IS MINE! (second to Sheska) Tsubasa is a shonen mangaka (hmmmm that&#039;s what I&#039;m doing) who impersonates characters (kinda like I DO), and is a bit cold but loving (like when i had crippling depression). Tsubasa is more experienced than Kaos and Konome, and is willing to help them out and teach them new techniques, and even help out with finances (^o^). 10/10 waifu for me! Just need her to Jojo pose once and then she&#039;d be number 1.<br />
<br />
Rukki &quot;Big Boobies♥Himeko Chan&quot;: The master of hentai herself. Rukki is really perverted (she draws hardcore porno), imagines her friends doing it, and ends up looking like she is having sex on multiple occasions. She claims to have big titties as a mangaka, but she is depressed that she is actually flat. She also writes teen romances, but mostly P O R N.  Rukki wants to draw a kids manga, but is too perverse to do so. (TBH she reminds me of my addiction with this pervy stuff) She is a nice girl and is understanding and a bit of a mentor to Kaos. KaoRukki I ship it! Her pen name is Big Boobies♥Himeko Chan.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall I am enjoying this series a lot! After the anime finishes, I will read the manga, and pray for season 2, and a dub so I can get a Blu Ray release in my local tech store. I&#039;m going to also take the tips I&#039;ve learned and build up the courage to release my own manga. I&#039;m hoping I can be successful like these girls are (and trying to surpass themselves), and as an artist, this anime is a must watch. Also its fucking hilarious. <br />
<br />
<br />
(This review will be updated once any announcements are made, and once I complete the current season. The score won&#039;t change much, but some minor details in the review may be tweaked)<br />
<br />

    This is a very cute anime in and a nice anime. The characters are cute and their interactions were also cute and sometimes funny to me to what they were doing, well one of its genre was comedy. I liked the character that Moeta Kaoruko had at learning more about how to improve her art and how to have confidence in my opinion. This is just part of my taste in anime so you dont have to agree with me if you dont like my opinion. So i will recommend this anime to people that like cute things and slice of life.

    Is this the best Anime ever? Is it the best Anime of the season? Does it have the best characters and the best story?<br />
<br />
The answer to all the above questions will most probably be No, but don&#039;t let that hold you back.<br />
<br />
It might not thick the boxes that any other Anime does of this season, but somehow this was still my favourite Anime of this season. The story is simple and easy to follow. The characters are loveable and well designed, even has one of my favourite supporting characters of all time. The art is beautiful and pretty cute at times. Sound is also pretty

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281763">
        good, for reasons I can not really say without spoiling a bit.<br />
<br />
This Anime made me cry, it made me laugh and fall in love. And that is really all that matters. Would 100% recommend to give this a watch.

    Remember the archetype forms that we have come to know and love or hate all these years? More recently, the &quot;Cute Girls Doing Cute Things&quot; genre has set off recent classics such as Madhouse&#039;s amazing &quot;A Place Further Than The Universe&quot; last season and much earlier, to Passione&#039;s &quot;Hinako Note&quot; in the same season last year. This season introduces us to Comic Girls, which tells us the tales of 4 mangaka girls, each with their own aspirations to make it big in the comic zone (and potentially get their hard work paid out in the process).<br />
<br />
The series core is as simple as it can come

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281760">
        close to, but don&#039;t dismiss it as bad, because it is wholesomely good and holds well on its own. And who doesn&#039;t mid a simple premise yet the storytelling does the rest of its job maintaining the direction of the series? I&#039;ll take that any day than some convoluted storylines which only make sense towards the ending of some series (*cough* Dances of the Dragons &quot;cough*). At the very core, this series teaches us the ups and downs of life being mangaka, because in real-life Japan, while replicating as faithful as the manga adaptation was, it is a direct but not perfect exact situation. HOWEVER, what Comic Girls was able to slap with was some moments of literally comical-drawn scenes and some yuri (but thankfully not too much) scenes but what I loved is how everything comes together to form a single imperfect but pretty representation overall.<br />
<br />
The characters (Kaos, Tsubasa, Ruki, Koyume plus the illusive Fuura) all are really likeable on their own AND as a whole. Kaos being the childlike newcomer, learning the ropes from experienced mangaka, Tsubasa with her action sequences, earning her the name &quot;V-Wing Senpai&quot;, Ruki with her calm, composed yet flushed expressions, Koyume whose mindfulness rests on her health (bulging stomach) but still focuses on yuri manga (light-hearted) and the ghost-like Fuura which scares the heck of the cast every now and then. Overall, they mesh well together and as one, they overcome the extremes of being mangaka and are able to have quality time together regardless of the circumstances and that&#039;s pretty satisfying to watch.<br />
<br />
The art and animation is comical-like (you see the relation?), bringing the title to relation. For one, studio Nexus is a newly founded studio in recent years, whose reputation lies in the OK-made Wakaba Girl back in 2015 and the excellent &quot;Calvary of a Failed Knight&quot; (also in 2015). So you could discount this as a new studio...BUT! For another, their work on this series IS impressive to boot, bringing their prowess from Calvary over to here, and I&#039;ve gotta say, the art and animation is what hooked me into this series in the first place. It&#039;s just so beautiful and well-made, even the comical-drawn-esque scenes were well done with the classical character model faces made to replicate as mangaka would draw on comic grid paper. Another point that&#039;s seeing the effort of the people behind this series, absolutely marvelous.<br />
<br />
The music is something else too. For one, I absolutely have a love-hate relationship on the OST being handled by the cast and/or crew of series gone by, probably because they sound mediocre but decent at the same time, and this series broke my convention and having the OST delivered nicely is something I appreciate so much about this series. Yes, it&#039;s THE cast of the Comic Girls, but I love the OST here so much so that&#039;s it&#039;s energetic and calming respectively (for OP and ED).<br />
<br />
Overall, the elephant in the room? I&#039;m really quite sad that this series is underrated and underappreciated, just by the initial looks of it that people cast of as an generic anime and forgot about it. So take my word, try this series out and see how much it can surprise you by having less characters, a simple story and pretty good OST, and how everything combined forms a picture of a thousand words. Yet another CGDCT, BUT it&#039;s a well done CDGCT, a blast to watch and time well spent.

    I started watching this from the very first episode. But due to me starting to read LN, I got more interested in reading than watching. Now that I&#039;ve mostly caught up. I&#039;ve come back and finished this gem.<br />
<br />
This is honestly, My favorite show of the season. With only one other show I found interest in. It&#039;s not that surprising.<br />
<br />
The characters in this I really like. I ended up associating their hair-color more to their names than their actual names. For example. <br />
I call characters <br />
Purple-Hair-Girl &gt; Ruki<br />
Blonde-Hair-Girl ( Also could be Yellow-Hair-Girl )&gt; Koyume <br />
Blue-Hair-Girl &gt; Katsuki<br />
Black-Hair-girl &gt; Fuura<br />
Pink-Hair-Girl &lt; Kaos <br />
The names besides Kaos&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review283560">
        name weren&#039;t really that rememberable. So I ended up usually calling them by their most unique characteristic<br />
<br />
I like Kaos. She is probably the MC of the MC&#039;s. Although she usually isn&#039;t as focused on. I like her really pervy side while also being really innocent. She will always be filled with joy when being hugged by the other girls. I do end up feeling kind of bad for her that she is so small. I like imagining that off-screen she has a massive growth spurt and at least becomes as tall as the other girls. I&#039;d love if they went away for summer and when they come back, Kaos Is a giant girl with big boobs and what not, Just so I could see their reaction, I&#039;d imagine that Ruki would get a ton of... Material for her manga work.<br />
<br />
Ruki Is probably my favorite if not then 2nd favorite right next to Kaos. I like her character and personality. I also love how she only really exceeds in drawing Porn even though she&#039;s more of what you&#039;d call the level-headed one. There are plenty of Yuri themes in this. But I do think both Ruki and Kaos are the best together.<br />
<br />
Koyume Isn&#039;t a bad character. But I have seen her character before in other anime. So I don&#039;t have too much to say. She&#039;s the airhead of the group and has a crush on Katsuki.  She also loves food, That&#039;s mostly her character. She&#039;s still fun to have on screen. But boiled down and she seems kind of basic.<br />
<br />
Fuura Is probably my 3rd favorite even with her having the least amount of screen time. Her character fits her genre of music (Horror) I&#039;d say that both her and Ruki are probably the most attractive of the group. I do think both Ruki and Fuura would also be a good couple tbh. I have trouble deciding if I like Ruki and Kaos more or if I like Furra and Ruki more. So I decided to just settle it and say fuck it, We&#039;re going the Harem route.<br />
<br />
Katsuki Is probably my least favorite of the group. I do find things I like about her. But she didn&#039;t interest me from the start. So with the story focusing so much on her tell around episode 7. My dislike seems to have grown more. When I look back, She&#039;s bad. She has funny moments. It&#039;s just during the time with having stuff shoved down my throat. I eventually got annoyed. I always like Tomboy characters. But she just doesn&#039;t do it well. I think her character would be more interesting If she was a very girlish girl but she tries to act like a Tomboy for her stories or whatever. When she was acting girly, I think she was actually pretty interesting.<br />
<br />
I noticed from around episode 10 or 11 tell the end, That the creators got really creative with the animation. It was honestly a nice sudden change from the usual calm animation you&#039;d expect from a show of this genre. <br />
<br />
I do find episode 11 and 12 to be kind of depressing with them moving out and them seeing all the other Manga artist that have already grown up. I felt that was a little down but then we got to the very end of episode 12.<br />
<br />
Overall, This show is pretty good and much more then what I&#039;d expect with such a premise.<br />

    *Sorry for my bad english<br />
I doubt why this anime&#039;s reviews have people give so much score? My personal opinions I think this anime overrated.<br />
Story is simple, about four girl in manga&#039;s dormitory. If you expect this anime will be like bakuman or about manga&#039;s industry, I said nope. This anime will be like generic cute girl do cute things with content there can find in other that in same genres. For short this anime is only about 4 girls manga writer&#039;s life in dormitory. <br />
Art and Music is good. I&#039;m enjoy with them.<br />
Every characters in this anime will be different stereotype live together, If this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295016">
        can make charm from these stereotype will be okay, but result is every character is very annoying. Like they hired to make every action to match their stereotype. So much is Moeta and Katsuki. Moeta is one character is same since episode 1 to episode 12, I know she has develop in the end and that is very slowwwwwwww I think I will be annoy her for first, She should be like in the end episode since episode 5 or 6. But thing this anime make well is distributing characters&#039; story. If I&#039;m not interested in personality I think they have interesting background&#039;s story. Unfortunately If this anime more emphasize with this, I think I will like this anime.<br />
Thing I feel annoying from this anime is drama that swtich with comedy in every episode in level make tone in watching broken. For Example.<br />
(Every Character do something and make we laugh)<br />
One Character: Oh I have bad past bla bla ba<br />
(Sad Music come)<br />
Overall, This anime are not too bad, If you like cute girl do cute things or kira kira girls you may be like this anime. But It&#039;s bad and boring for me.<br />
Score:3 two from art/music and one from background stroy of every character.

    Adapted from a manga series,Comic Girls surely tries to bring the pain and struggle of the manga Industry into an anime,together with its own style.Although keeping its own style is important,they should also consider whether it&#039;d be a great idea from a general anime perspective.By now,it somehow shows its uniqueness,but doesn&#039;t feature Comic Girls really well.<br />
<br />
+good opening and ending song<br />
+diversified characters&#039; personalities <br />
+Hilarious and crazy characters&#039; actions<br />
+nice character reactions<br />
+Ending summed up the story<br />
<br />
-it feels episodic <br />
-Bad story premise<br />
-story feels shattered because characters work on their own<br />
-repetitive or overused ideas <br />
-undeveloped characters<br />
-poor transitions<br />
<br />
At my first glance,I was really excited about Comic Girls,I saw cute girls,beautiful visuals

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284312">
        with characters with different personalities,I also received servals laughters too.With such a great start,Comic Girls could be potential.However,it starts to get lame and boring later on,which I couldn&#039;t grow on the characters or the story anymore.<br />
<br />
The main problem of Comic Girls is its presentation.At first,I was supposed that the characters in Comic Girls are working together,but in fact,they&#039;re just working on their own.Although sometimes they managed to help each other,at the end the main focus would be just onto one or two characters.Therefore,there&#039;re not much remarkable character interactions.Moreover,The story feels extremely inconsistent.It feels episodic,each episode doesn&#039;t have any sort of relationship towards others,many weird transitions all over the place.Sometimes,it has comedy moments,but then it suddenly jumps to emotional moments.In other time,it seems to be concentrated on one character,but then it talks about another character,which seems the story is going to nowhere and I don&#039;t know what exactly Comic Girls wants to express through each episode.<br />
<br />
In addition,the character development doesn&#039;t seem to be good.Although each girl has their own personality,they feel pretty unrealistic and undeveloped.The setting that a bunch of highschool girls that are manga authors as well is a poor story premise for a slice of life anime,as this would be very unlikely happened in reality from a general perspective.In addition,there are also several unrealistic moments in Comic Girls as well.For example,teacher suddenly drags a student out of the classroom and said to him,I like your drawing.It feels very weird and abnormal.Apart from the characters just working on their own,the main storyline is just Kaos improving on her work.Other time,other main characters are just supporting cast,while only a few moments focusing on them.At the end,I just grew on a little on Kaos,but not for the others.<br />
<br />
I find that the comedy delivered to me is kinda funny and boring at the same time.At first,I get a lot of laughters because of the hilarious and crazy characters&#039; reactions.Unfortunately,by the more episodes you have watched,it will become lame and flat,as ideas are becoming repetitive and overused.Characters feel jealous about other characters&#039; boob size,scared of things and being sleepy during classes,it feels cliche,repetitive and boring,so overall the comedy offered in this show is unsatisfactory.If the comedy and ideas used in the show are refreshing and new,it&#039;ll be more interesting.Sadly,it doesn&#039;t happen in Comic Girls.<br />
<br />
After a long and rough ride,I finally come to the ending.The good news is that Comic Girls somehow manages to summarise the story events and the story ending is quite fine for a slice of life anime.<br />
<br />
Finally,let&#039;s talk about the animation and the sound in this show.I&#039;m kind of impressed with the animation in this show. Colourful visuals are used and cute moments in a comic style,looks original and nice,together with different cute character reactions.It is kinda nice,but if more visuals are used on the background would be better.Voice actors are trying to play their roles well,opening and ending are nice and interesting with its own style.I noticed some background music and soundtracks in this show,but if there&#039;re more of them used in the show,it&#039;ll be greater.<br />
<br />
Unless you&#039;re in a similar position as the character,you probably won&#039;t able to get much enjoyment from this show.Although Comic Girls tries to attempt a great story with hilarious moments,it feels like a total mess and a failed work at the end,except for the ending.Therefore,many improvements and efforts are needed in order to develop a better and an amusing slice of life,comedy anime.<br />
<br />
I used to love slice of life and comedy anime,but not this one apparently.<br />
<br />
Story:5/10 (D) (35%)<br />
Animation:8/10 (A) (10%)<br />
Sound:7/10 (B) (10%)<br />
Characters:4/10 (E) (25%)<br />
Enjoyment:5/10 (D) (20%)<br />
Overall:5/10 (D) (Fair)

    Now this was a surprising anime. I went in expecting your typical “cute girls doing cute things” moe slice of life comedy that we seem to get at least every season. And it was in fact a “cute girls doing cute things” moe slice of life comedy. I’m already extremely partial to these type of shows and it’s really hard to make them not enjoyable (With the exception Hinako Note. I’m falling asleep just thinking about that one.) Comic Girls follows 4 manga artists who all move into a dormitory to work on their original stories and attend school. Surprisingly, the whole school aspect of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281793">
        Comic Girls isn’t really embraced that much. There are a few scenes to be had in this environment, but most of the fun happens in the dorms or out in the city. From the get go, Comic Girls lets you know that you will love each and every character in this anime. All four of them manage to be so lovable and fun to see interact with one another. Kaos (The definite main character) should be protected and kept happy at all costs because she deserves to be loved and cherished. She’s a 4-koma manga artist who struggles being... Well, good at manga. Tsubasa is an athletic tomboy who really only cares about her popular Shounen manga series. When she gets into writing, she dons the outfit of the hero of her manga to hype herself up. Ruki is s rather innocent and serious manga artist who despite wanting to stick with children stories, somehow ended up writing more erotic ones, much to her disappointment. Koyume is another up and coming manga artist who’s always energized, peppy, and writes romance manga (She also has a crush on Tsubasa, so that’s a plus.)<br />
All the characters have different methods when it comes to writing their stories, how they prepare, how they relax, and how they help one another. All four look out for one another and become genuine friends quickly. <br />
The comedy always hits its mark. There’s never a joke that goes by that isn’t at least worth an inner laugh. Yet the anime also manages to add in very touching moments. It finds the perfect balance of when to be funny and when to get emotional. While the animation isn’t anything too special, Comic Girls does this thing where it’ll suddenly appear like a manga panel on screen which can add to the charm and humor in some cases.<br />
While it doesn’t have the biggest focus on what goes into making a manga itself, it still shows how time consuming and stressful it can be, especially since the c at are all high schoolers. By the end of the anime, they all have grown in their own way in order to make their manga better than ever. You get to see how they improve and the strides they make as manga artists. It was filled with lovable characters, had great humor, great chemistry among the cast, and surprisingly touching moments. This is an anime I will genuinely miss seeing each week. I haven’t heard much about the source material, but if there’s enough to work with, I would be so damn happy to see Comic Girls make a return someday. We need more Adventures of Kaos-chan.

    - Finally my review on Comic Girls, starting with the story that as you might expect, the story is extremely simple but very interesting and fun to follow thanks to the direction that knew how to create extremely fun and relaxed moments throughout the anime; in general there is not much to say about the story, it&#039;s a simple but fun story to follow.<br />
<br />
- About the technical parté, it is simply magnificent, the Nexus studio did an excellent job in Comic Girls, even being a comedy anime with slice of life; the animation and visual are simply magnificent, the scenery is beautiful, colorful and detailed;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282028">
        the direction is also another point that deserves to be highlighted, the direction has managed to transform a simple anime into something extremely relaxed and fun to accompany, and of course a great humor well balanced; now about the soundtrack, this is another point that Comic Girls stands out, the soundtrack is very good, especially for a slice of life anime.<br />
<br />
- Now about the cast, undoubtedly this is the strongest point of this work, the characters are extremely charismatic and easily conquered, in addition to being well developed throughout the episodes, with emphasis on the protistist Kaoruko Moeta, finally the cast of Comic Girls is simply magnificent, the characters are captivating and charismatic, perfectly matching the work&#039;s proposal.<br />
<br />
- Conclusion, Comic Girls is not only one of the best animes of the spring season 2018, but also one of the best slice of life anime comedy I&#039;ve seen to date; no doubt I recommend Comic Girls, the anime is simply sensational, with a first-rate direction, along with a dazzling technical part and, moreover, a cast of captivating and charismatic characters; Comic Girls is simply magnificent !! 🌺😍💖 !! <br />

    This is yet another wholesome series, with good characters and enjoyable character plots. The art is good and the OP and ED are perfect for the series. <br />
<br />
Story – 7<br />
It’s very enjoyable, with many different character plots that mostly feel complete. <br />
<br />
Art – 6 <br />
I enjoyed this, with impressive character reactions, backgrounds that feel real and many different locations for shenanigans. Some scenes feel like your reading a manga with a creative art style.<br />
<br />
Sound – 7<br />
The OP and ED are perfect for the series and are a great addition to the series. The background music helps emphasis character reactions and emotional scenes.<br />
<br />
Characters – 8<br />
I love

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326710">
        these characters with the secondary characters helping the series feel more vibrant. <br />
Kaos-sensei is a very emotional character and feels amazing to watch the different reactions she has to different situations.<br />
Koyume feels more like a supporting character and doesn’t have much character development, but helps Kaos-sensei flourish.<br />
Ruki is one of the better characters in the series with really funny scenes; she helps Kaos-sensei with her life while providing funny scenes.<br />
Tsubasa is a strong character, but I feel that she takes a real back scene in this series.<br />
<br />
Overall – 7<br />
I really enjoyed this series, the art, story and sound real creates a comfortable feel and allows the characters to have an emotional, wholesome series. the ending leaves most of the characters arks complete and leave a perfect ending for a sequel. I would recommend this series if you enjoy a cosy feel. I hope that they make a season 2 that can hold a torch to this series. <br />

    I might spoil the show when analyzing the characters. So don&#039;t read if you haven&#039;t watched the show! Unless you don&#039;t care...<br />
<br />
<br />
I am an artist. It may seem like I&#039;m bragging, sorry if it does, but it is pretty important to my enjoyment for this show. Cause even though every artist doesn&#039;t have the same experiences, there are things that many artists do feel. <br />
Being ashamed of oneself work, not feeling deserving of food and other self-destructive thoughts. <br />
I have never really seen an anime about art that shows this side of how artists feel. There are probably other shows that do this. Maybe even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298408">
        shows I have seen that do this. But this is the show that has made me remember that part the most. Cause the artist part in many anime characters is irrelevant in most cases. The character might be memorable, but the fact that they&#039;re an artist isn&#039;t. It isn&#039;t important for the character that they are an artist.<br />
I&#039;m not saying that a character should change because of a hobby they have. But that&#039;s kind of what it is. To most artist characters I have seen, it is just a hobby. Again, this is fine. But for me to really resonate with an artist character, the art part should be their personality. They&#039;re hobby effects them as a person. That might sound weird. But it is the one thing that makes me like Comic girls so much.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the show, Moeta moves into a dorm with exclusively artist. This was a way for her to gain experience from these artists. To find inspiration. But as I see it, I wouldn&#039;t say that living there was particularly good for her. Yes, she finds very good friends and the ending might have been different if she didn&#039;t live there. But, Moeta doesn&#039;t really feel good living there, even though the friend she makes, makes her happy. Cause as I said before, there are things that artist do when they&#039;re not happy with their work. And living with two artists that already have serialized works, this feeling is only amplified. As Moeta lives in the dorm, she does a lot of self-destructive things. She stays up all night to finish her comic ideas, that she knows will inevitably be trashed. She rejects food since she doesn&#039;t feel deserving of it. Of course, she doesn&#039;t even have a serialized comic yet. <br />
<br />
And as an artist, I resonated with her a lot. All of the feelings she gets around her art is something me and a lot of artists feel. I can tell that an artist wrote the story. <br />
<br />
And she wasn&#039;t the only artist that was written so well. We also have Ruki and Tsubasa. While they weren&#039;t as relatable, they were still really good. While Tsubasa doesn&#039;t have any particularly bad feelings against her art (At least from what we know), her parents do. They are very much against her drawing. That&#039;s why she moves to the dorm so that her parents wouldn&#039;t shame her. <br />
Ruki also experiences something a lot of artists do. When becoming an artist, her agent sees how attractive her art style. She advises her to draw more attractive manga since her art style compliments this genre. This leads to her being successful as a hentai artist. And while she tries to implement a romance aspect into the comics, that doesn&#039;t help her self-image. The fact that she&#039;s a hentai artist kills her. It&#039;s only when she meets her fans and she sees how much they care for her story that her self-respect gets better. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sadly, this was only how I felt in the beginning When we stopped learning about their insecurities, the story gets a lot more boring. We keep seeing Moeta&#039;s self-destructive nature from time to time. But it wasn&#039;t as interesting as before. <br />
<br />
<br />
But because of my bias, I will give this show an 8. I would have given it a 7 before. But the very accurate depiction of artists was just so interesting to see. <br />
<br />
Weak 8/10

Drawing quality is great, I like the art style. Images are colorful, pretty, characters are cute. <br />
Haven’t noticed any animation issues, movement seemed realistic (expect of course when intentionally tried to be funny). (It’s hard to do a good job, people can easily notice when something is out of place, just don’t feel right. So, this is a great sign.)<br />
Sound effects and music are on point. (dramatic/ominous sound drops)<br />
Story/characters are funny and sweet. (I laughed a lot and my eyes got teary from time to time.)<br />
Pacing was consistent. (Spoiler: Aliens don’t just unexpectedly show up in the last 20% of the show. …well, maybe

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295773">
        they do, I might just haven’t noticed them.)<br />
<br />
10/10 (in its category – I mean it’s not the most mind bending, edgy, genre defining peace with the most substance, but it has some value, life lessons… )<br />
