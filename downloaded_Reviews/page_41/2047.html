    Of all the Anime series that I have viewed, Record of Lodoss War holds a special place in my heart.  If you happen to be fond of fantasy adventure videogames as I am (or great literature such as J.R.R. Tolkien&#039;s The Lord of the Rings), then this 13-episode video series is a very clever hybrid of these two great works of art. It&#039;s got everything fans could ask for--dragons, elves, dark gods, unlikely yet compelling heroes, villains you&#039;ll either hate (or love, depending on who you side with), action, suspense, romance, a small dose of humor, and an engaging feel to keep on watching

        by the time each episode ends. <br />
<br />
This is a direct-to-video animation series produced back in 1990, which unfolds over thirteen half-hour episodes. Adapted from the fantasy novels of the same name by Japanese author Ryo Mizuno, Lodoss is a classic good-vs-evil story, exploring the chronicles of six adventurers: these include Parn, a young, inexperienced warrior eager to (literally) jump at any chance to clear his father&#039;s tarnished name; Deedlit, a spunky, mystical high elf who tries (with varying degrees of success) to prove her love to Parn; Etoh, a loyal, good-natured cleric; Slayn, a gentle wise mage; Ghim, a gruff and tough dwarf; and Woodchuck, a wanted criminal who nonetheless provides loyalty (and occasional chagrin) to his pals. <br />
<br />
The story is hardly original, and the plot tends to &amp;quot;jumps around&amp;quot; from one event to the next (for instance, the first episode starts off in the &amp;quot;middle&amp;quot; of the heroes&#039; quest; chronologically, it&#039;d be best to see eps 2-5, 1, and then 6-13)--yet the overall show is so engrossing that this fault (in addition to a few others I&#039;ll come to in a moment) becomes irrelevant.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s the characters which make Record Of Lodoss War so much fun, and much of the best scenes belong to Parn and Deedlit; especially in a royal banquet episode where she forces Parn to dance with her (one of my favorite sequences from the show). As is typical of a elf-dwarf rivalry, Ghim and Deed bicker about each other&#039;s differences yet maintain a somewhat begrudging level of self-respect. It&#039;s Parn, however, whose plight stays with you long after the show approaches its climax. Eager to discover whether his father died in disgrace or not, he finds a father figure in Kashue. (This gets on Deedlit&#039;s nerves; she continually competes with the king for Parn&#039;s attention--a running gag that plays out unfortunately for only a couple of episodes.) In the latter episodes, we meet two new characters who don&#039;t get much screen time but are no less fully realized. Shiris, the hotheaded young mercenary who vies with Deedlit for Parn&#039;s affections is strongly depicted, as is her partner (and secret love), Orson, the moody Berserker, who becomes an angry, uncontrollable monster at the sight of Shiris in trouble. <br />
<br />
Even the bad guys are richly developed. Ashram, as mentioned, isn&#039;t driven so much by malice as he is by what he believes is right; in fact, he becomes the most three-dimensional of the villains for that reason alone. For support, he has a Dark Elf accomplice named Pirotess (the opposite of Deedlit) who&#039;ll do anything to prove her loyalty to him... including sacrificing herself. Karla, incidentally, is no ordinary villainess. Her primary goal is to bring to Lodoss the balance she feels has been so greatly disturbed... yet her psychologically unbalanced persona leads her to cause far worse chaos with deadly consequences. She is shifty, cunning, manipulative -- an almost deadly combination. Wagnard, on the other hand, is just plain evil -- every bit the equivalent of Kefka from Final Fantasy III who cackles fiendishly as he puts his dark plans into action. When we first meet him, he appears to be a nondescript character, but when he becomes possessed by Kardis, he becomes frighteningly villainous. (Every scene he&#039;s in sends shivers down my spines.) <br />
<br />
Its the strength of the characters and their chemistry as well as the compelling (if jumpy) plot that make Lodoss as a whole that one can overlook its occasional shortcomings, notably the animation, which, although gorgeously drawn, uses a low cel count resulting with some stiff movements. Taking into account that this is an older show, however, this doesn&#039;t really detract all that much (although there are some later episodes where some of the same footage is reused, for cost cutting purposes). <br />
<br />
No fantasy adventure would be complete without a stirring soundtrack, and Record of Lodoss War delivers this in style. The musical score by Mitsuo Hagita is mostly symphonic, although it is (obviously) generated by electronics. Yet the compositions were so rich and lovely that they eventually grew on me over the course of the show. Equally lovely are the opening and ending theme songs, &amp;quot;Adesso e Fortuna -Now &amp;amp; Fortune-&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Fantasia of the Wind&amp;quot;, both of which are excellently sung in Japanese by Sherry. As a nice bonus, these songs were even translated for the English version; the woman who sings the dubbed songs, Lisa DeSimone, sings with an equally splendid voice. <br />
<br />
One aspect of Lodoss often criticized is the English dub, produced by New York-based Central Park Media in 1996, a time when most dubs had a low reputation. I&#039;ve read all kinds of mixed opinions about this English track; some say its fake and/or mediocre while other claims its unbearable, but here&#039;s a better review from one of its several (albeit outspoken on the net at least) enthusiastic fans (that&#039;s me). No, it&#039;s not perfect, and some lines do come off as a bit awkward, but a lot of the voice-overs are really good. In particular, Billy Regan (Parn), Lisa Ortiz (Deedlit), Al Muscari (Slayn), Jacques Le Can (Woodchuck), Simone Grant (Karla &amp;amp; Leylia), John Knox (Ashram), Jayce Reeves (Wagnard), and Alexander J. Rose (Wort and the Narrator), are among my favorites. Plus, the dialog is close to the subtitled script and packed with some memorable one-liners (Parn: &amp;quot;Quick, Deed, what&#039;s this dragon&#039;s weak spot?&amp;quot; Deedlit: &amp;quot;I&#039;m not a dragon expert! How should I know?!&amp;quot;) and great chemistry between the actors. I especially loved the interactions between Parn and Deedlit, the banter between Ghim and Deed, and a lot of other things. Which is why it saddens me that some would find all of this &amp;quot;inferior&amp;quot; to the Japanese language track. I listened to parts of the Japanese language track, too, and while I did find it to be of top-quality, I find that the dub still holds its own position decently. Of course, it may be in danger of being overshadowed by some of the better dub productions of today, but for a dub made in 1996, its a rather decent, if unspectacular listen. I&#039;m still fond of it, as a matter of fact, even after hearing some better ones.<br />
<br />
Record of Lodoss War has received its share of detractors over recent years, probably due to its cheap production values and/or inconsistent plotting. However, it is important to remember that these &amp;quot;shortcomings&amp;quot; is mainly because it&#039;s an older Anime series. While Lodoss may show its age in places, its infectious appeal and complexity rings true even after other shows of its ilk, and like most classics, it can stand against the test of time.

    Overview:<br />
<br />
Record of the Lodoss War was a HUGE hit when it came out in 1990 Japan. It also gained strong popularity among the tiny US anime fandom of the early 90s. Unfortunately, this anime has not aged gracefully. Normally I hate using the phrase &quot;aged poorly&quot;. It&#039;s something that young punks use too often to just shit on anything over 10 years old. In this one instance though, I&#039;m afraid it&#039;s kind of unavoidable.<br />
<br />
Background:<br />
<br />
Record of the Lodoss War was a 1990 OVA based on a Japanese short novel... based an a Japanese tabletop RPG...which was a ripoff of Dungeons and Dragons. Take the most cliche

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285863">
        Western high fantasy tropes and they are ALL here in Lodoss War, distilled down to their most basic. The characters go well beyond archetypes and into the realm of laughably generic. The plot was already just a standard D&amp;D campaign in the novel, but the 10 episode OVA had to cut out a LOT of the novel. If Wheel of Time is like bare bones high fantasy, this OVA is like sucking the marrow from those bones.<br />
<br />
Popularity:<br />
<br />
As I mentioned previously, this OVA was a smash hit and spawned a ton of video games, radio dramas, manga, and a 27 episode sequel! So HOW did it get so popular?! To understand this, we have to go back to the year 1990 and look at it from that perspective. Ring the bell sucka! School&#039;s in session! <br />
<br />
Just as it used to take a few years for a Japanese fad to spread to America, it took a little bit for American trends to spread to Japan. In the early 90s, Japan was heavily influenced by American culture of the 1980s. High fantasy was HUGE in the 1980s. The utterly mediocre Wheel of Time books were dominating the best seller lists in America. WOT gained such popularity in the Southern US that Atlanta created Dragon Con as a WOT convention. To this day it is the largest geek convention in the Southeast US! Dungeons and Dragons was an absolute cultural phenomenon. He-Man was the most popular toy in the US. You couldn&#039;t go anywhere without running into Tolkien inspired high fantasy with elves, dwarves, orcs, and all the rest. There were plenty of high fantasy based video games in Japan by 1990, but not really any high fantasy anime or manga at the time to meet this demand. Record of the Lodoss War was created to fill a hole that NEEDED filling back in that time. Today, there really isn&#039;t the same thirst for Tolkien style high fantasy and there are already 100  fantasy anime better than Lodoss War. Keep in mind that Japanese gamers LOVED Hydlide when it hit home PCs back in 1984. Today...there isn&#039;t much of a Hydlide fandom. Lodoss isn&#039;t THAT bad, but at times it feels close.<br />
<br />
There is one other reason that Lodoss sold like hotcakes back in its day. Deedlit the Elf chick and her sex appeal. Deedlit was in many ways the first true &quot;waifu&quot; in anime. Before this you really didn&#039;t see lonely virgins collecting TONS of figurines and body pillows of their favorite anime girls. You&#039;ve probably heard lots of people online waxing nostalgic for the anime heroes of the 80s. They all had chiseled muscles, hard jaws, broad shoulders, and looked MANLY! When have you heard people talk about how they want female designs from 80s anime back? That&#039;s right. You haven&#039;t. Look at the top 300 waifus on MAL. You&#039;ll see Yoko Littner, Senjougahara, Rei and Asuka, Lucy Heartfilia, Nami, Erza, Hinata, etc. NONE of these were around in 1990. Even Android 18 and Major Kusanagi weren&#039;t around yet. The only rivals Deedlit had were Lunch from Dragonball and Cutie Honey from the 1970s!<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
A young swordsman with no parents must team up with an elvish archer, an axe wielding dwarf named Gim, a Wizard, and a thief to go on a long journey and thwart an evil God. Did I mention this series has little imagination of its own? The only creative thing to come out of this series was an evil sword called &quot;Soul Crusher&quot; that took possession of its owner and had a giant eye in hilt. The game Soul Calibur BLATANTLY stole this from Lodoss War. I mentioned this before, but the novel had to be very abridged. In one episode, our heroes decide they need to go meet an old wizard and learn the weakness of an evil sorceress named Karla the Grey. In the next episode, it just announces that they have returned from seeing the wizard and learned all about her. Lodoss has a firm policy of &quot;Tell, don&#039;t show.&quot;<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The characters once again are SO generic that I can&#039;t really say much about them. Instead I&#039;ll focus on Deedlit, who is the only character ANYONE remembers from this series. She was drawn with long blonde hair, massive bouncy breasts, and very soft facial features. Deedlit was being drawn by a young Satoshi Urushihara, the KING of breasts! That&#039;s all I need to say. She IMMEDIATELY falls in love with the young swordsman right after meeting him and plays his sexy sidekick. She doesn&#039;t really have any chemistry with our leading hero Parn, but her looks still win her &quot;best girl of 1990&quot;. Fuck Bulma! She was still being a total bitch on Namek at this point.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The art by Studio Madhouse is decent for the most part, but this wasn&#039;t Madhouse&#039;s top performance here. In the 80s and early 90s, Madhouse was at its best with feature films like Wicked City or Ninja Scroll. It could also do 3 episode OVAs like Cyber City &quot;God Damn Vampire&quot; Oedo, which looks WAY better than Lodoss. With a 10 episode OVA, the budget got so strained that we end up with a still image of a dragon getting dragged across the screen in a moment of unintentional hilarity.<br />
<br />
Music: <br />
<br />
The soundtrack is pretty damn limited and plays the same tracks over and over. The closing theme is awesome though and contains the line &quot;please fall asleep on my breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Lodoss is not an anime that&#039;s going to knock the socks off new anime viewers in 2018. Still, if you are interested in anime history and want to see a neat time capsule of the year 1990, it is worth checking out. Just go into it knowing what to expect and put on your archaeologist hat.<br />

    Knights, clerics, elves, dwarves and dragons occupy some of our biggest inner-nerd imaginations. Some of my fondest memories were playing old school dungeon-crawler video games on the PC, and interacting with this type of fantasy lore. Lord of the Rings, Willow and the Chronicles of Narnia all come to mind when reminiscing of some of my favorite fictional fantasies, and there’s plenty of anime out there that scratch the itch. Legendary anime studio Madhouse attempted to tackle Record of Lodoss War in the early 90’s, a time when fantasy novels and movies were undoubtedly on the rise. It has a palpable Dungeons and Dragons feel,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249188">
        and is nostalgic of those all-nighters with friends, chugging our Mountain Dews and munching on Doritos while rolling the 20-sided die one more time. Unfortunately Lodoss is plagued with a sense of “generic” that’ll have you thirsting for more depth… which’ll sadly never come. Coupled with some of the most inconsistent English voice acting I’ve ever heard, it’ll be an anime you’ll probably forget soon after watching it.<br />
 <br />
My biggest complaint about Lodoss is that it wasn’t given the proper amount of episodes to expand its story properly. It has such an engrossing atmosphere and massive worldbuilding potential that is squandered terribly due to a lack of time investment. What we’re left with is a marginalized “good vs. evil” approach, thinning the cast of characters to generic protagonists and antagonists. A series with this much imagination needs the proper nurturing to ensure success, and 26 episodes would’ve given it more of a fighting chance. On top of that, they decided to drop the viewers into the middle of what is chronologically after the 5th episode… only leading to the confusion. I don’t know if different mediums of media were trying this reverse storytelling at the time, but it was entirely unnecessary and only confused the hell out of me, and I’m assuming a lot of other people.<br />
 <br />
You follow Parn (yep, sounds like porn) and his stereotypical group of fellow travelers (a cleric, wizard, elf, dwarf and thief) as they seek to prevent the destruction of the planet by baddies that want to control the universe. Sound intriguing? Well, I can assure you that this is the Dynasty Warriors button masher of plots. Considering the source material is actually written to emulate a D&amp;D experience, the dungeon master must’ve been rather disappointing. The main character transforms from useless fodder to going toe for toe with the most powerful foe on Lodoss (which has definitely never happened in an anime before), all in the course of like 5 episodes. There&#039;s a loose backstory referencing his father and restoring his family’s honor, but it’s unconvincing at best. Generic quotes like “I&#039;ll get you!” and “you&#039;re no match for me!” resonate from his vocabulary on occasion, and you sense there isn&#039;t much there are on his intellectual level. Parn’s childhood friend Etoh, the with perhaps the worst English voice actor of all time, accompanies him as a sworn companion.<br />
 <br />
Deedlit, a high elf and Parn’s hinted love interest, is a princess that randomly decides to join the adventure. Given the fact that she’s actually of royalty, she naturally drops everything to answer the underlying question of what is happening to her people. And honestly, the rest of the main pack is irrelevant. A gaggle of genericized fantasy tropes, which doesn’t create the best selling point. The most interesting character in the entire series is Ashram, a knight who seeks the highest power, but has some serious self-identification and reflecting to do in the process. He’s initially perceived as a villain, but can actually draw some empathy and understanding as the series elapses. <br />
 <br />
In addition to being a relatively generic series, Lodoss is littered with bits of randomness along the way. Although the “potential” romantic relationship between Parn and Deedlit never actually develops, there are plenty of awkward exchanges or long stares that force the viewer into thinking there’s something there. I’m just not buying it, there’s almost no chemistry between the two. Not to mention the interest fellow traveler Shiris (the girl with the berserker friend) has in Parn…. something that&#039;s awkwardly left by the wayside. There&#039;s also the evil witch Carla, with perhaps the most unassuming name in anime villainy existence, and another dark elf that sporadically falls for Ashram along the way. The more I get frustrated with the lack of finesse in writing, the more I realize what the anime was modeled after: a D&amp;D quest. Speaking from experience, the element of randomness doesn’t even scratch the surface of the ridiculous stuff me and my friends used to come up with when we played. So…. I guess there’s that.<br />
 <br />
Sometimes I don’t consider it fair to criticize animation from the 90’s or earlier, because it’s merely a sign of the times. In Lodoss’ case, the art style isn’t necessarily my cup of tea but it’s consistent with the art out at the time in terms of quality. From what I remember reading, the studio actually utilized a sizable budget in order to get exactly what they were looking for in terms of emulating various fantasy elements and characters. Some of the fight scenes are actually quite fluid as well, something that earlier anime had issues with. No choppiness or quality drop during the heavier action sequences, something I can really appreciate. Especially when you consider the issues modern day anime have with frame drops and inconsistent animation, likely without any legitimate excuse.<br />
 <br />
Did I mention how bad the voice acting is? Central Park Media, a NYC based company took the reigns dubbing Lodoss. It was clear they had no idea what they were doing. Some acting is decent, but others are absolutely atrocious. It’s almost as though when the producers signed off on it they were doing more of a “screw it”, knowing they’d be out of a job anyway. If you’re a fan of dubs due to convenience, I strongly suggest you watch the Japanese version or avoid it altogether. It’s THAT bad. Performances like this employs hopefulness for my future seiyuu career… I digress.<br />
 <br />
The rest of the music is slightly unfitting, but about what I expect from an early 90’s series. Anime was largely in a learning period, starkly evident by the slow female ballads present in their OPs. For a show so focused on action and fantasy elements, the OP just...doesn’t work. As a standalone track it’s quite present, reminiscent of “Fly Me to the Moon” from NGE, but not an anime fit. The background tracks depict the genre much better. They’re full of orchestral life, and build crescendos left and right. <br />
 <br />
As much as I disliked certain aspects of Lodoss, I enjoyed it overall. However, one must understand that most of my enjoyment comes from a mix of nostalgia and relatability. I was a HUGE nerd in my high school days, so Lodoss speaks to me in some ways other anime cannot. On the other hand, it’s leaps and bounds from being “good” by any normal definition. Perhaps I would’ve enjoyed it more if I had watched the Japanese dub vice the English, but a generic plot, short run time and forced romance all work to cripple Lodoss, dooming it from the start. I would recommend this series to fans of other fantasy anime or earlier shows, or those just looking for something different. As always, thanks for reading!

    Story:<br />
<br />
Overall though this was a good OVA. However, the Story is very scattered and doesn&#039;t have proper closure. The completest in me tells me I have to at least see the TV series that follows. I haven&#039;t had any luck finding it, however. This anime has a special place in my heart due to the nostalgia factor. I only hope that the TV series that follows this up somehow gives better closure. And one minor gripe, I think all of us understood the backstory of Lodoss by the 3rd episode so it really wasn&#039;t nessesary to retell it prior to every episode.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
It&#039;s very good looking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9209">
        for an older piece, however it&#039;s not so old as to forgive some of the shortcuts and mistakes that are noticable. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
I love good sound. This doesn&#039;t really diliver however. IMHO there&#039;s no excuse for 2.0 now that dvd has been on the market so long. other wise it&#039;s got repetative music that you&#039;ll never forget. But that doens&#039;t make it good. Sigh...<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
All of the characters have some sort of charisma to them. Parn and Deedlit are still one of the most recognized anime couples of all time. I just wish there was more down to earth characters like Woodchuck.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
I really do like this anime alot. It&#039;s more nostalgia than anything but I do like it. I recommend this Anime to fans of Lord of the Rings and Dungeons and Dragons or other swords and sorcery stories. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Fanboy opinions and nostalgia aside you should...<br />
<br />
Borrow it! <br />

    Going into this anime, I didn&#039;t have very high expectations, but it was part of one of my favorite genres. Also, this is one of the anime where I had some of the hardest time actually deciding on how to rate it.  Then, I realized that it is probably going to be just above average. And it did just that.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
It revolves around the wannabe swordsman named Parn and his fellow adventurers who are trying to avert further warfare and save Lodoss from the oncoming evil. This is a setup for a good anime, and I liked it. However, there were many plotholes that could

          <span style="display: none;" id="review196193">
        be dug into this anime, and for good reasons, and not necessarily bad ones. This story was meant to be more of a story about a hero who triumphed against all odds, and trust me, the odds were stacking against him WAY more than I anticipated, but he prevailed in the end, and got the girl. Also, it felt like it was VERY rushed too, so there is that. So basically, it wasn&#039;t horrible, but it definitely was what I expected, and did have some twists and turns I did not expect, but overall, it did its job. (5/10)<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Oh, I dreaded actually getting to this part, because it is a 90&#039;s anime, and I know I shouldn&#039;t bash a 90&#039;s anime for not looking very good, but sadly, the animation was bad, and that is even when you consider the times it was in. There was a whole lot of reused shots and reused still images. Also, some of the flames didn&#039;t look like flames, some of the blood didn&#039;t look like blood, and even some of the lip movements didn&#039;t even happen when a character was speaking, despite them not being too far away. It just looked like a big mess. Sure, I did enjoy seeing how some of the characters looked and how they moved, but oh my word, I sometimes had to pause the anime, when a particularly badly animated scene or movement occurred. (3/10)<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Now, the anime surprised me a little by adding in music that wasn&#039;t exactly fitting the tone all the time, nor was it varied, but it was consistent and knew what it was trying to say, even if it didn&#039;t always say it. It had a couple of REALLY good songs, or selections of songs, and some of the sound effects weren&#039;t that bad either. However, there were a couple songs that were mediocre at best. The voice acting was pretty good, but it just wasn&#039;t as great as it could have been, both dubbed and subbed included. It was just above average, but it didn&#039;t pull through all the time. (6/10)<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Well, what can I say, there were some I really liked and some I really disliked. Parn, for example, has some of the best luck I have seen of a fantasy anime protagonist, like seriously. He didn&#039;t even know how to fight with a sword until almost halfway through the third episode, and by the time the anime ended, he apparently was good enough to handle one of the main villains, who could easily kill him in the first few episodes. and even though this is the character section, another problem I had was the lack of time notifications about whats going on. I really didn&#039;t like that part, especially when it came to the development of characters. Also, the love story between Deedlit and Parn felt SO forced that I could become one of the most confused people on the planet after seeing it, and yet it was still so interesting, because you know it is part of the story. Also, everyone else just felt more like someone who was just there to fulfill a necessary spot, of both the different classes and races like humans, elves and dwarves. I don&#039;t know. They were all very likeable, but at the same time, there was not much time to explore into many of their stories. (5/10)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
However, this was the highest rated part of the series, and it is the shortest. I REALLY enjoyed watching this anime, despite all of these mediocre findings of mine. What can I say? I love fantasy, and this anime fulfills the role nicely, even though it has a lot of flaws in it. To me, its like seeing Lord of the Rings. Sure, there are a number of plotholes in it that I can think off the top of my head, but it definitely was very enjoyable to watch, and after watching this anime, I want to explore more of the lore in this universe, because it is so fascinating, and yet there was so little that was put forth out there.<br />
<br />
Overall, I really enjoyed this anime, despite its flaws. It may need a lot of work in different areas, but I do recommend you watch it, even if it might not be that great.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10.

    An excellent job of sword and sorcery, that has become an everlasting classic for anyone to enjoy. Many others like it fail where this anime grabs you and truly enthralls  from the very beginning. Its character progress is a defining aspect that leads to a wonderful adventure. It has everything in just the right dosage, not too mention great character interaction. The art work for its time is sure a landmark in anime. If i had never seen this great masterpiece i would have never acquired my addiction for all things anime.

    This is one of anime&#039;s most beloved titles, even though I never learned about it until this year on TVTropes. Plus I felt bored of watching nothing but Pokemon and Sword Art Online all throughout the semester, so I figured I might as well try something I&#039;ve never seen before. This has gotten a lot of praise from fans, and I thought I&#039;d like it. To an extent, I did, but...honestly, I can&#039;t really see why people like this. Now don&#039;t get me wrong, it&#039;s not a BAD anime. Heck, I&#039;d watch this over every ecchi anime in the world! However, there&#039;s just too much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review123659">
        wrong with it to really be conceived as anything other than decent. But the show&#039;s main problem is that it&#039;s just way too short and way too convoluted for its own good. By convoluted I mean like Digimon Adventure 02 convoluted. What do I mean? Let&#039;s explain, shall we? (Note: this review is only about the OVA, not the TV series. I haven&#039;t seen the latter, and don&#039;t know if I&#039;m going to or not)<br />
<br />
There&#039;s definitely a story to this anime. But the problem is, I can barely comprehend it, as there&#039;s just WAAAY too much being shoved down my throat. All I managed to comprehend was that a group of people meet and join forces, an evil empire called Marmo is trying to take control of Lodoss, there&#039;s some evil spirit trying to manipulate everything, and at the end, some wizard tries to resurrect one of the goddesses that split Lodoss. That&#039;s about it, really. Remember when I said Escaflowne isn&#039;t giving people time to absorb its story? Well, I take it back. Lodoss does it too, but far worse. There&#039;s so much going on within that timespan that it tries to bite off more than it can chew. It doesn&#039;t help that everything jumps around like a kangaroo high on sugar, so you can barely tell exactly what the heck is going on! Part of it could be the fact that its thirteen episodes long, and had it been extended to 26 or even 52 episodes, the story would be more comprehensible, and everything would feel more connected and flow better. If you want to tell a good story, don&#039;t just throw in a bunch of events and shove them down our throats without giving us time to chew it! Popolocrois had 25 episodes, yet it had a perfect balance between the story and the characters, the episodes felt more connected, and they kept a consistent yet restrained output. It gave time to develop its story and explain what was going on, and it didn&#039;t need to rely on adding in as much stuff as possible. It knew how much it could chew at a time and managed to come out fine in the end. Lodoss really needs to work on that.<br />
<br />
The animation...I&#039;ll be honest here, it really hasn&#039;t aged well, and there&#039;s lots of errors. Heck, one part of the opening sequence looks like two of the characters were cut from paper and pasted on a background! There&#039;s too many still frames, and I think the animators wasted too much budget on making everybody&#039;s costumes as elaborate and fantasy-like as possible. But I do like the character designs, though! Plus nobody looks the same. In a time where modern anime characters look too much the same except with different eye and hair colors and different hair lengths, the character designs in this are very refreshing. I&#039;ll at least give the show credit for that. The music...while the opening and ending are nice, they&#039;re still a little bit generic, and the background music isn&#039;t really all that memorable. Some pieces sound like they came from popular video games, like Zelda or Final Fantasy.<br />
<br />
The characters...eh. They&#039;re all kinda bland to me. Nobody was even remotely interesting to me. We have the hero, the chick, the mage, the skeevy guy, the evil villains, etc. Because the story is so freakishly convoluted to the point of looking like an overflowing trash bag, it really suffered in characterization. They could have made these characters into real characters, but here they&#039;re just a bunch of bland archetypes. The only characters I thought were even remotely interesting were Orson and Shiris, and they don&#039;t appear until episode eight! I really want to like these characters, but even after 13 whole episodes, I still feel like I&#039;ve only JUST started getting to know them. They could have been more fleshed out, which is a shame. Had the creators gotten more episodes and didn&#039;t try so hard, they could have been able to do great things with them.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a difference between balancing things out and biting off more than you can chew, and unfortunately, Lodoss is the latter. While I appreciate its efforts, it was just trying too hard, and because it tried too hard, it suffered greatly as a result. Escaflowne had somewhat the same problem, but it had 26 episodes (it was going to be longer but their budget was cut so they had to make do with 26), and it at least tried everything it could to get its story out, and it wasn&#039;t freakishly convoluted either. It also did its best to fit in a lot of character progression, even though it was also extremely focused on its story. Plus, their characters were more interesting! Escaflowne, while it didn&#039;t entirely succeed in its effort, at least tried to balance out its story and characters, and for what its worth, it did a good job. Popolocrois has 25 episodes, yet it knew what its story wanted to be, didn&#039;t try to go for anything big, and balanced out its story and characters in whatever time it had, and it really worked in its favor. Lodoss...it just wound up biting off way more than it could chew, and wound up suffocating in the process. All it really needed was more episodes and more time to flesh out both its story and characters so we&#039;d be able to comprehend everything better. Maybe they had budget issues and couldn&#039;t do it? Were they not able to get it to air on TV? I dunno. Also, we also get reminded that there was a great war resulting in the creation of Lodoss. It&#039;d be one thing if this was said once, but he explains it in EVERY SINGLE EPISODE!! We freaking get it! The story&#039;s hard enough to comprehend as it is! That pointless opening scene was really not necessary, and Lodoss has suffered enough as it is.<br />
<br />
All in all, Lodoss isn&#039;t a bad anime. It was just too short and took on more than it could handle. All it really needed was more episodes and a lot of polishing. But I can at least appreciate its good points, and if you&#039;re looking for an escapist fantasy anime, check it out.

    First of all, i can slap myself for not watching or seeing it  as an kid, though i noticed it decades ago the collection in the VHS store´s, but i had no idea about it until recently and its MAGICAL.<br />
 This ova serie´s that i think a side or continuation of the t.v serie´s ( 1990) that was a cornerstone for fantasy anime till this day with exception of Y´S ( 1989).<br />
But there is a catch if u watch it for the 1st time ever, and its that u have to watch the epidose´s in the right order, start with episode 2,3,4,5 after that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review124181">
        watch the 1st episode , than # 6 till 13 in order wich i never was able to solve why they did it. <br />
Storywise it was definetly a epic fantasy , dark and well put together with the whole package, dragons, Knights, spells, ancient kingdoms, sort of a ´fellowship´, princesses, trolls, treasures ect. ect. and ofc could be very violent at parts.<br />
 As for the animation , in my eyes it was almost flawless for its time, very low background animation fails, charachters and villians design was quite well done and had the right outfits, but what i love the most are the DRAGONS!!!!!!! for 1990 it looked tight and well animated , fluend movements and drawn to look terrifying, we don´t see it like that anymore , sad.<br />
FANTASY OPERA as i call this,and i not mean only the intro but througout the ova serie´s has numerous moments with opera music blended in nicely, to me the intro alone i played it repeatedly in my head, rememberable.<br />
 Most of the charachters had a good relationship , likable and not the sort to be forgotten easely, especially if u are an anime fantasy fan, only the main protagonist has still some of that oldskool hotheaded type like that rushed in fights without thinking , those kind of chara popped out everywhere in the late 80´s and 90´s, a bit tasteless, but does have a good turnaround later on. <br />
Elves are some of the main basis as charachters and storywise, if ur talk about fantasy ofc, and they have a great role in lodoss.It was more than entertaining, it was a very colorful and memorable experience to me that finally i watched lodoss war, till i gonna get the full t.v serie´s, too bad i never saw it aired because it somethinf like Record of lodoss war could fill up lots of today´s fantasy anime that has rushed or weak substance!

    I&#039;ll go ahead and get the inevitable comparison out of the way. Record of Lodoss War is The Lord of the Rings of anime. Maybe not as highly regarded as Tolkiens fantasy trilogy but still a spectacular addition to the genre.<br />
<br />
One of the very first OVAs I was introduced to back in the late 90s ROLW was everything I&#039;d ever wanted out of american animation but never recieved. A dark and serious fantasy adventure that touched on all the familar qualites that the genre is known for. Knights, Elves, Dwarves, Dragons, Wizards, and epic bloody battles. This was a show strictly made for Fantasy fans.<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review92581">
        story is pretty straight forward with a few twists and surprises here and there but it&#039;s mostly the world is in peril from a great evil and our band of heroes must set out to defeat this evil and save the peoples of Lodoss. It&#039;s simple but satisfying. Theres great characters throughout the entire series and just when you think theres no one else to introduce we get treated to probably my two favorite characters Shiris and Orson. A couple of bandits that join up with our heroes around the midway point that gives the show a breath of fresh air after the few dark eps leading up to their introduction.<br />
<br />
Last thing I want to touch on is the animation. Now remember this is 1990. So its not going to be nearly as pretty as what your use to watching these days. But theres  a certain charm to its dark and dirty old school style approach that makes me apprechiate it even more today then I did back then. It&#039;s a great product of an art style long gone.<br />
<br />
Record of Lodoss War. Fantasy fans shoud love it. Casuals should apprechiate it. Whichever catergory you fall under one things for sure. You should respect it.

    This one is a little bit serious. If you want to talk about this in DnD perspective, these are the guys that take everything serious and say that you can’t talk out of character and all that. Sure there is a little comedy but it is pretty much ether nurd-ifide or magically complicated. Maybe this is why I don’t really get along with the serious people… because I didn’t much care for it. Now this doesn’t mean that it is bad, oh no. It’s far from bad even to today’s standards. It just takes a lot of talking and standing around before anything really significant

          <span style="display: none;" id="review71077">
        gets done.<br />
<br />
The characters are alright though I have to wonder about the names and character designs. Ghim, the dwarf, reminds me a lot of Ghimbli from Lord of the Rings, and I’m not sure but depending on when Rune Soldier was made, Deedlit looks a lot like Crysta, the elf girl they meet. No matter how you try to sugar coat it, Parn is pretty much a weakling trying to fit into his father’s armor, though that’s mostly what he looks like. He does have a brave heart though, which I have to sit down and roll my eyes at since it’s pretty much generic. The whole thing is freaken generic and rather boring to me most of the time. <br />
<br />
The animation, though beautiful, felt more like still shots with lips flapping because The fight scenes aren’t well done in today’s standard. They might have been fine back then but I come from a generation where we like our active fight scenes and not this ‘clash swords and talk’ thing most of the characters do.<br />
<br />
The voices, mostly actually miss in the English version and since I couldn’t find the Japanese, I couldn’t see weather it was the same there too. This is just one that I really wish had some more comedy to keep me interested. The narrator got on my nerves a hell of a lot more then the others though. It seemed ever part that could have been better without any sound was voiced over to talk about what was right in front of us!<br />

    Once, a young man toured the empty, echoing halls of an ancient dungeon, a place abandoned by time and now slowly, painfully grinding towards a final collapse named &quot;Blockbuster Video&quot;.  A few petty coins were left behind for his prize, a priceless treasure known as &quot;Record of Lodoss War&quot;...<br />
<br />
OK, enough of that, you want to see a review of the 13-episode OVA series Record of Lodoss War.  So, right off the bat, here&#039;s my objective opinion: This is a flawed, often deeply-flawed series, but one that has a lot of high points to go along with its flaws.  Personal opinion, though? 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241995">
        I love this series.  I love this series because its creators clearly loved it, and that shows.<br />
<br />
So let&#039;s talk about those flaws.  The story is strong, but the pace of the story is fairly uneven, taking its sweet time here and there while rushing (or even skipping) ahead at other parts.  In fact, &#039;uneven&#039; could probably be the big criticism of Record of Lodoss War as a whole, since it can, thanks in part to those pacing issues, be applied to the problems with the characters as well, since we&#039;re missing or at least have poorly emphasized elements of their development and arc.<br />
<br />
The animation is another thing, and part of where I&#039;d like to point out being able to see a creator&#039;s love for something: The images are all gorgeous.  Look at just about any still from the show and chances are you&#039;ll be able to like what you see.  Now, I don&#039;t actually know the production history of Record of Lodoss War, but later on, when you just know the budget was running dry and corners had to be cut they just use... less of it, relying on slow pans over their scenes and very limited movement.  It never looks worse, just less animated.  The &quot;Budget is out, have to cut corners&quot; ending situation is hardly unique to Lodoss, but unlike other examples the creators of Record of Lodoss War knew where they could cut those corners and where they absolutely could not cut them in order to still tell the story they wanted to tell and transport the viewer to this fantastical world.  Again, trying to think of it objectively I have to mark the show down for what it did there, but I think they found the best solution they could to their problem that it seems clear from the final product that they faced.<br />
<br />
For all its problems, Record of Lodoss War has a very timeless quality to it, a trait it tends to share with the best of the best in fantasy if not in media in general.  It&#039;s very earnest.  It feels natural.  It feels, I dare say, real.  Or perhaps more than real it feels like an actual legend.  In this day and age when so many works pillage their predecessors all the way back to the myths and legends of the world and end up feeling hollow or artificial it&#039;s somewhat astounding to see something, much less something with the fairly shallow roots of Record of Lodoss War (which clearly owes much to the 1974 genre-shaper Dungeons &amp; Dragons) that feels like it could stand up alongside them.  <br />
<br />
Part of that is because, I personally feel, that the people involved clearly wanted to tell this story and tell it well.  Another part I realize now might actually be the very flaws of the piece helping to propel it forward.  Few indeed are the myths and legends that are complete and self contained, so when Record of Lodoss War frays at the edges but manages to do so in a graceful manner it ends up invoking not dissatisfaction with what was missing, skipped, accelerated through, or seemingly riddled with plot holes or continuity errors, but rather it evokes the sense of those old tales that are generally told and retold through many sources, leaving them misty-edged glimpses of a tapestry that can never be beheld in a full and finished state.  Whether by design or by accident, it seems possible to me that the elements that make Record of Lodoss War technically weaker may be, in some ways, actually enhancing the emotional experience.<br />
<br />
And in the end, that&#039;s what Lodoss best delivers: an experience.  If you&#039;re going to come in to this like a health inspector setting foot in the kitchen of some old, beloved diner you&#039;re going to find problems here and there and you certainly won&#039;t enjoy yourself as would the patron soaking in the warm hues of the yellowed wallpaper and rich bread-and-grease aroma of the patty melt brunch on its way to them.  To an extent, that&#039;s true of any work of media.  Someone watching something as a critic can&#039;t be forced to get invested if they&#039;re too busy thinking and analyzing to feel.  But it&#039;s especially true for works like Record of Lodoss War that play more strongly to the viewer&#039;s emotions, rather than a mystery or think-piece that goes primarily for the intellect.

    This OVA is Considered An Underrated Masterpiece!! Yep!! The characters are Well developed. Parn &amp; Deedlit&#039;s Relationship is way better than generic Anime relationship. The Music Of This Anime IS FREAKING ORCHESTRAL-LIKE MASTERPIECE. The Story is Reminded Me Dungeons and Dragons With Mix elements with Lord Of The Rings(BTW, I Didn&#039;t Watch Lord of The Ring movie trilogy yet, Surely I Plan too). The Artstyle is Unlikely Generic Fantasy light novels yeah!! This Artstyle Looks Mature Period. Animation is The Best If you watch in Blu Ray Version. This Could Be Everyone&#039;s Favorite &amp; Became My Favorite OVA. Also English &amp; Japanese audio Are Great.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254073">
        I&#039;ve watched in Japanese Audio cause Ashram is Voiced By Akira Kamiya(Voice of Kenshiro from Fist Of The North Star, Ryo Saeba from City Hunter &amp; Kinnikuman From Kinnikuman)

    Record of Lodoss War is the greatest fantasy anime I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
The animation is gorgeous for the time. The design of everything is just spot-on for Western D&amp;D-inspired adventure fantasy. So spot-on that some will claim Record of Lodoss War is too generic. In my opinion, this is a case of &quot;if it ain&#039;t broke don&#039;t fix it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The story itself is predictable, but hits every note you would hope to see perfectly. I appreciate how there isn&#039;t any lewdness or humor forced in. This is just Tolkienesque fantasy with no catch. Just a party of adventurers slayin dragons and saving the world.

    A fantastic piece of fantasy anime that feels like it brings alive the lore of a Dungeons &amp; Dragons in the medium of Japanese Animation. I really liked the heroes who were all well-drawn personalities despite their fantasy archetypes and the villains were well imagined as well with several morally &#039;grey&#039; entities inhabiting the moral ground between the armies of Darkness and Light struggling for Lodoss such as the Grey Witch Karla and wildcard Dragons. With even secondary characters like the Good King Fahn and the Dark Emperor Beld receiving some impressive development the series has a sense of history and worldbuilding that helps create

    A classic by definition is used to describe a certain piece of media that had stand in a test of time for its insurmountable quality. Record of the Lodoss War, for its time in the 90s, had a cult following with the high fantasy genre booming in the West and Japan taking heavy influences of these genres such as space operas and of course, high fantasy. Record of Lodoss War&#039;s blatant influences can be stemmed from the 1974&#039;s tabletop RPG, Dungeons and Dragons and certain elements from the publication of J. R. R Tolkien&#039;s Lord of the Rings are implemented into the 1990 OVA series.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review288710">
        The original novelization of Record of Lodoss War was penned by Ryo Mizuno, who must&#039;ve adored Dungeons and Dragons and decided to write a series as an inspiration. Then, later adapted into a 13-episode OVA or Original Video Animation produced by Studio Madhouse (Yes the same Madhouse that did One Punch Man, Overlord, Monster, etc.) They have been around for the longest time in the industry. For those who don&#039;t know, OVAs are straight to video that were commonly known for its minimal production value. The 90s were the times OVAs was constantly littered into VHS, DVDs, and other physical copies that nowadays, are rare. <br />
<br />
So, how does Record of Lodoss War holds up in modern day standards? Honestly, no except visually. The story, characters, setting, aesthetics; everything is a love letter to the high fantasy genre and considering how much an inspiration the series has taken from, Record of Lodoss War is none other than a shallow recreation of the beloved tabletop RPG or other fantasy series. You have knights, elves, dwarfs, sorcerers, clerics, thieves, and many other standard tropes of high fantasy imaginable. It is Western-styled based high fantasy except it&#039;s the Japanese version of it. For its time, it is understandable how it can appeal such an audience (nerds/geeks) in the 90s. However, despite the beloved series, it is nothing more than nostalgia fest.<br />
<br />
Record of Lodoss War&#039;s presentation is as basic as any setup for a high fantasy; wars, dragons, quests, conquests, kingdoms, you name it. Each episode starts off with a narration foretelling the events that most likely happen to the world of Lodoss. The rest of the series follows a really by-the-books adventure with our central protagonist, Parn and his group of generic template RPG class group members: Etoh, a bowl cut cleric, a long-bearded axe-wielding, Ghim, a wise mage, Slayn and the most popular character everyone remembers; Deedlit, a high elf who is beautiful and courageous. How they met was merely out of circumstances that forced the group to be together to further the plot. There&#039;s also the forces of good versus evil the characters brought themselves into and this is where the majority of the plot revolves around. There&#039;s no excitement throughout and if you an avid watcher of anime, the predictability can be apparent. The lore itself is also half-baked and usually when its mentioned, used as a exposition device to pan the runtime. <br />
<br />
Of course, the story won&#039;t be interesting without the characters, right? Well, the investment towards the main cast aren&#039;t well developed enough. We never know most of the main group&#039;s motivations except Parn&#039;s curiosity of his late father. Deedlit, the most beloved waifu, has no depth either. Deedlit&#039;s main role is to act flirty around Parn for some forced and flat romance or to act spunky. The rest of the characters are similar of having no depth. Therefore, the connection is skewed and left with no care to what happen to them. Even the side characters aren&#039;t interesting in the slightest. Karen for example, without spoiling, served a role to give the characters a sense of danger and threat that supposed to make Karen as intimidating as possible. The so called villains aren&#039;t nuanced in particular shape or form; they are the most mustache twirling villains template, its laughably generic. As if, everyone are bound to be plot devices.<br />
<br />
It may looked like I am bashing on Lodoss but not entirely. Lodoss has some really good aspects aside from the lack of characterization and story. As previously mentioned, Mizuno wrote Lodoss as an inspiration and Madhouse achieved that vision in the visual department. The artwork is mesmerizing, the attention to detail in the costume design, monsters/goblins/dragons, weapon sets that look amazing, environment that stayed true to its fantasy counterparts like castles and its interiors, and character designs that look ethereal. Specifically, the female characters. The artist, Satoshi Urushihara, was known for his exquisite female characters with very voluptuous &quot;body shapes&quot;. Yes, he was most known for his hentai works apparently. Other than that, we have the soundtrack. Composed by Mitsuo Hagita, mostly deal with symphonic sounds to capture the feeling of majestic in a fantasy setting. The opening theme song (recently becoming one of my favorites), Adesso e Fortuna, encapsulates that high fantasy vibe in a romantic way. These aspects I praised for capturing the aesthetics of high fantasy Lodoss was known for. <br />
<br />
Should Record of Lodoss War be considered a classic? Well, in a sense, yes it is. If speaking on the perspective of the majority in the West who have grown with the OVA series, there is a certain magic that resonated with them because it was a time period the genre of high fantasy was booming. Of course, the &quot;similarities&quot; to the tabletop RPG and J. R. R. Tolkien&#039;s Lord of the Rings are present with Lodoss, as a love letter to Western high fantasy. The comparison to Lodoss to D&amp;D is unavoidable. Despite these massive flaws, the fans of the series adore Lodoss and there is an enjoyment factor when watching Lodoss. I liked the detail in the art (the dragons are drawn superbly) and the soundtrack. Although, I find it to be a chore to sit through from its lack of depth and originality. Not that it is god awful, I wish I could find the charm of the series but I just couldn&#039;t. The mediocrity stuck with me start to finish. <br />
<br />
If you think you can get into this series, there are other series like Lodoss such as Grancrest Senki, who was penned by the same author. There&#039;s the supposed sequel, Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, which is supposed to be the alternative version of the 8th episode of the OVA, just extended. Lastly, there&#039;s Legend of Crystania, a spinoff. I can certainly recommend Record of Lodoss War for diehard fantasy fans if you don&#039;t mind the tropes and simply experience it, you will have a great time. Overall, a hugely flawed love letter to Western high fantasy.

    first anime I ever watched and i been hooked on the genre ever since!!!<br />
I just loved how it was basically an RPG come to life, tell me an epic story any day of the week!!! From start to finish character development/progression is prevalent in ALL characters, not just the main. even the villains have motivations for their actions. I honestly wish it was longer but even for 13 episodes it felt like an &#039;epic&#039; tale without sacrificing the pacing at all.<br />
<br />
Depending on the time frame you pick this up, you may be off-put by the art style but for the early &#039;90s this was gold,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314293">
        pure animated goodness!!! though its been a while between this review and my actual watching of the show i can&#039;t recall the musical score being anything but appropriate. bass drops occurred in time with the action beats, not a whole lot of &#039;BIG EXPLOSION&#039; moments but the fight choreography was impressive and well thought out between knights crossing swords with wizards chanting spells from the rear to assist everyone was in place where you would expect them to be and if they weren&#039;t... then things most likely didn&#039;t go well for the side that slipped up.<br />
<br />
All in all great work done well with lots of care and it shows. give it a view and see for yourself!!!

    The age of this series shows, but the OVAs still hold up today as a classic high fantasy anime. The story itself isn&#039;t anything special and plays out like a D&amp;D campaign, and the characters are pretty much ripped out of a D&amp;D session as well. But that&#039;s the charm of it, It&#039;s just a straightforward high fantasy story. I&#039;ll also admit the influx of the &quot;Isekai&quot; genre has influenced my review as the most generic fantasy plots are masterpieces compared to that garbage.  <br />
<br />
Animation and sound wise it still holds up fairly well for something it&#039;s age, and the first episode in particular

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262684">
        had animation that puts some series today to shame in comparison. Story wise as I said before, it&#039;s pretty much a D&amp;D campaign in animated format. Your enjoyment of it hinges on whether you like those kinds of plots, I did so I liked it. The characters are all pretty generic, but that&#039;s what makes them endearing. They aren&#039;t some ridiculous over the top anime trope like a lot of &quot;fantasy&quot; anime does these days. Parn the main character isn&#039;t a Japanese teenager who got killed by a truck and sent to this fantasy world where he&#039;s given a ridiculous OP power that&#039;s considered weak. He&#039;s just the son of a knight who starts off as a complete greenhorn, and by the end you see his progression both in his combat skills and his personality.<br />
<br />
All in all, it&#039;s a classic series that I&#039;d recommend anybody who loves Fantasy or those who are tired of the bland self insert Isekai genre to check out.<br />
<br />

    Record of Lodoss War was recommended by a classmate back in university, during a time when VHS was still a thing. Anime releases in North America back then were generally abysmal, favoring titillating shows or big productions over diamonds in the rough, and you usually were stuck with shows with low-budget dubbing, replacing passable or overacted Japanese acting with terrible acting by unknown actors or extras furiously trying to stay in sync with the animation.<br />
<br />
When I watched this in the university dorm (complete with so-so fan subtitles), I couldn&#039;t wait for the next episode. And the next. Great shows always leave you wanting more (terrible

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278513">
        shows leave you demanding a refund), and Lodoss War is probably the anime that, to me, sets the bar for quality.<br />
<br />
So, yes, the animation is dated. Well, think about the computers that were available in 1988-89. Apple IIs, greyscale Macs, an Amiga if you cared about graphic quality. None of these were used in the animation business at the time (that I know of, anyway-- graphical processing power just wasn&#039;t up to snuff). Anime was hand-drawn on cels, every single frame, 24 frames per second. Sometimes they will loop an animation and zoom out the camera to save a few yen, but that kind of shortcut breaks the illusion easily and was used sparingly. If the director or anyone in charge of production calls for a retake of a scene, it had to be redrawn, completely. If the colors were off, you didn&#039;t have color correction, you had to redraw it. Don&#039;t believe me? Watch Shirobako. They&#039;re not kidding when they say animation was extremely hard work in these days. Just as Steamboat Willie was state-of-the-art in its day, so was the animation in Lodoss War, and doubly so because OVAs allow a good production staff to take its time to make sure everything was right, unlike the mad dash of a weekly television series. Sure, showing the glint of the blade tip rather than the full animated swing is a shortcut, but it is undeniably effective (and no anime since has used this nearly as effectively). The animation staff knew exactly how to employ the imagination of the audience and draw them in. I&#039;m sorry to say, this is a lost art today largely because animators now have the tools to show us all the gory details, overload our senses, and leave plot and characterization in the dust.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack. Oh, yes, the soundtrack. The score&#039;s soaring battle themes evoke Carl Orff&#039;s Carmina Burana (which is fitting, because that was the soundtrack of the film Excalibur). The composer, while he&#039;s no Yoko Kanno (let alone Howard Shore, James Horner, or John Williams), nevertheless demonstrates his mastery of every section of the orchestra, from tracks that would probably evoke zombie apocalypses, to tracks that Vivaldi could&#039;ve written for a royal court, to tracks that could be the backdrop of Eomer&#039;s counterattack in The Two Towers. I usually don&#039;t remember anime soundtracks because they&#039;re totally unimpressive (or I remember them because they&#039;re terrible)-- I cannot say that about the soundtrack to Lodoss War.<br />
<br />
Adesso e Fortuna is the only anime song with a tango beat that I can remember (it&#039;s a slow tango-- listen to the bass line and the harp), and while romance isn&#039;t a particularly important part of the show until the final 3 episodes or so, it turns out to be a great match. The ending theme is good as well, but I never really got into it nearly as much.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is very well cast, written, directed, and performed. How do I know this? As another reviewer mentioned, there is chemistry. In the behind-the-scenes to Star Wars, we see that one reason why George Lucas cast (a very young and terrified) Carrie Fisher wasn&#039;t because of her Hollywood star parents, but because of her chemistry with Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill. If you want to see why casting matters, look at early deleted scenes of Star Trek: Voyager with a very different Captain Janeway. Poor casting (especially political casting) is never a benefit to a production, and thankfully here all the voices fit like gloves.<br />
<br />
Now, sure, it seems like an anime cliche-- fantasy theme, RPG party of a fighter, a mage, a healer, a dwarf, a thief, and an elf, now go and fight {dragon|evil warlord|wizard}. But you need to understand that you are watching the series that in my opinion set the standard for this genre. In fact, it probably did its job too well-- nearly every fantasy anime I&#039;ve seen since was either a cliched copy of this party, or a parody (intentional, in the case of Slayers, or otherwise, in the case of follow-up productions). Without a good script, the characters can&#039;t grow. Without good direction, the audience won&#039;t care about the characters. Here, the characters have depth, they don&#039;t remain who they are in the beginning, and they all have journeys, for good or ill. Good casting, great script, good direction.<br />
<br />
Part of me wishes that there are more episodes, and part of me dreads what happens when there isn&#039;t enough plot to go around. The pace is just right to me, and other than an introductory episode, there isn&#039;t much of &quot;jumping around&quot; to my recollection (which means I should rewatch the DVD). The story does meander a bit, and despite all the stuff happening, the show never loses its focus on the main cast. For all the liberties taken with the original RPG/novels, this is the best adaptation to animation, hands down.<br />
<br />
Am I biased in thinking this is the bar for all fantasy anime? Damn straight I am, and proud of it too.

    Oh Boy...I Wish I liked you More Lodoss...<br />
<br />
Ahem, Lets get this out of the way, The art, Sound and animation are for the most part really great. but as soon as we come down the Characters and cinematography, problems start to arrive in Spades.<br />
<br />
I see what Lodoss is trying to do with their limited 13 episodes and only giving us the nessesary bits and pieces to link the story together. but because of this it feels like the anime lacks a lot of focuss on what it actually wants to tell. and this effects the relation between it&#039;s main cast members the most.<br />
<br />
some of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254759">
        characters have pre-existing relationships and are together naturally from the start. others join the group seemingly out of convinience for the story. Both, without ANY naritive reason to stick together for the long run. there is ZERO character chemistry between any of them. it doesn&#039;t feel like a group that has been through thick and thin who came together for a collective cause. but more like a DnD-group that the DM threw together for the sake of it.<br />
<br />
Another thing that bothers me are the jumpcuts in the episodes. Some of them are place very akwardly and really make you go &quot;Eh Wait? was a part of the episode just cut out?&quot; Which makes everything feel very Choppy. One of the most notable example&#039;s of this is an assasination atempt inside a ballroom which instantly jump-cuts the main cast resting and the main character training with someone. WHAT HAPPENED INBETWEEN?<br />
<br />
I can see why Record Of Lodoss War is considered a classic by it&#039;s tone, style and aesthetic, but it&#039;s terrible jumpcuts and lack of character development makes it ultimately a very mediocer show.

    Record of Lodoss War is a basic high fantasy story that is carried by its gorgeous art, outstanding designs, and wonderful music. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s not much to say about the stories, characters, and themes. Your average RPG starter character Parn gets together with a group of RPG archetypes to go on a quest to stop a war orchestrated by some dark deity. The characters in the group are fine; they&#039;re not given much exploration, development, or backstory but they&#039;re each competent at what they do and their dialogue and interactions are fine. Deedlit falls into that category as well--- despite having an awesome character design that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325947">
        suggests she would play a bigger role, she&#039;s just there to be the chick to Parn. <br />
<br />
The story opts to focus on fledgling hero Parn, who of course talks a lot about saving people and rushes into battle but doesn&#039;t have any of the fighting skill to back it up. He&#039;s pretty much a noob who tries to be a hero up until the very last episodes and it gets tiresome to watch him get bailed out by the other, much more competent characters in the group. The emphasis on Parn over the more capable and potentially more interesting members of the group severely hurts the story. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the story, the group also just doesn&#039;t do much in general; for the first 8 episodes or so they simply travel from place to place. There&#039;s nothing egregious about the plot (except for one thing), but it would have had some life if the battles that they fought were actually well animated. I understand it was 1990 and their budget was limited, but still the slowness and reliance on still frames for the action sequences limits their entertainment value. That&#039;s not to say the art is bad, though. The backgrounds and characters are beautifully drawn and really convey that classic fantasy setting. <br />
<br />
I was OK with the plot until they damseled Deedlit so that Parn could finally man up and save her. Not only did they damsel her, they also seemed to use this as an opportunity to sexualize her. This is a cardinal sin in my book- they took a character with a strong design and objectified her. When Parn saves her, they act like he&#039;s a big hero who&#039;s gone through a lot of development, but in reality he didn&#039;t learn much and his sword skills made an inexplicable jump from noob to master. <br />
<br />
Anyway, enough about the plot and characters. Let&#039;s talk about the art and design. Like I said, the art is gorgeous. The designs are some of the best I&#039;ve seen in anime and in fantasy in general. Parn&#039;s suit is a great knight design and Deedlit&#039;s outfit, with its broad shoulder pads, is powerful and elegant. The face designs are among my favorite in anime. Each character&#039;s face is unique and handsomely constructed, achieving a perfect blend of anime beauty and realism. The male faces are actually handsome and not pretty in the feminine way that anime designs usually do it. Parn&#039;s eyes, in particular, do a lot to soften my dislike of him. The second series blindly discarded these face designs in favor of more generic ones. <br />
<br />
The music has an otherworldly beauty that capture the finest feelings of the fantasy genre, doing the job that the story and characters couldn&#039;t. The opening and ending songs feel like they embody the quintessential fantasy adventure aesthetic. <br />
<br />
The design and music alone make the series worth checking out, but don&#039;t expect too much from the actual story. <br />
