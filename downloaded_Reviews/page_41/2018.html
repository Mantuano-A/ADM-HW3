    Its been a long time since I&#039;ve seen a DB/DBZ Movie, and unlike all the other usual <br />
macho good guy vs bad guy films that I&#039;ve seen in the past of this franchise before.<br />
This film takes an interesting alternative within the series and starts to proceed in a different dimension in this movie compared to the other usual movies in the past.<br />
<br />
It would seem that this movie is actually cannon to the series stated by Akira Toriyama himself as this takes place 3 years after kid buu&#039;s defeat and 4 years before Uub&#039;s appearance at the world martial arts tournament within the anime. Don&#039;t worry

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113363">
        NO SPOILERS.<br />
<br />
Story - 7 <br />
If you have seen previous movies of this franchise, you will know that the premise within its own story is usually Basic and doesn&#039;t have much depth to them since its main focus is on Mindless and intense fights most of the time. <br />
<br />
The action scenes in this movie are few and have been tone down to show a lot of the characters from the series present within the film. <br />
This movie mainly follows a God that is known for destruction by the name of <br />
Birusu / Beerus / Bills? ( hmm however you address his name ), is woken up by his flamboyant assistant and caretaker Wiss after a 39 year slumber. <br />
Wiss informs Birusu of Frieza&#039;s defeat at the hands of a mysterious Saiyan (Goku) who transformed against him during their epic battle. upon hearing this, Birusu recalls a prophesy 39 years before his sleep, About an Oracle fish that told him about a So called Super Saiyan God that will compete against him in the future.<br />
<br />
Having witness Goku&#039;s Super Saiyan transformation against Frieza, <br />
Birusu feels now the time is right to face this saiyan with this SSG power.<br />
So him and Wiss decide to find the remaining surviving saiyans after the destruction <br />
of planet vegeta in order for birusu to test his God Powers against the one who possess this SSG power which eventually leads them across the galaxy to King Kai&#039;s planet where both Goku and Birusu face off for the first time.<br />
<br />
Ultimately the story starts of really well with its introduction and brings a fresh new look to the progression and feel of the characters from the anime however as soon as it gets to the middle where Birusu and Wiss arrive to earth and enter Bulma&#039;s 38th birthday party (Which by the way who even celebrates their 38th birthday anyway? since she is so Loaded.)<br />
its during these moments in the film where things for me personally became more tedious and a little too weird and random at times.<br />
<br />
The movie had some nice comedy and interaction scenes with many of the characters within the set pieces of this film. <br />
But during the middle I could see it started to drag on a little and it made the pacing of this film a little awkward to sometimes to keep watching which is understandable since this film has a more of a comedic tone to it, especially about that desert scene which perhaps could of used a different scenario perhaps. I know some people who did not like this scene involving a dispute between Birusu and Buu over a pudding cup (which believe me I&#039;ve seen worse). but ultimately I found it hilarious XD. <br />
<br />
This didn&#039;t turn me off instead however it kept me hyped for the tension and action that was happening and through the Last quarter of the film we find out the revelation of this Super Saiyan God and after, the incredible main event fight between Birusu and Goku which ends up taking place in many awesome locations from the city, forest, desert, mountains, cliffs, river, from underground labyrinth to the skies above and into the outer atmosphere of space itself (puff) it literally was Outstanding to watch to the end.<br />
<br />
Art - 9 <br />
A really Great plus to this movie was the animation as it looks awesome, which was also one of the reasons it was worth seeing and not only that but this film is also the first anime film to be shown on screen in IMAX. <br />
The locations throughout this film looked amazing as well as the action scenes, the CGI looked good within the angles even though its a little tricky to see here and there it still works really well. The character designs were nice apart from a few the super saiyan god form whether you like it or not I felt they could have done a better design <br />
(mainly the look of the hair and few other things but thats just my opinion) <br />
But also not to mention how Goku gains his SSG powers seems a little off, <br />
Also ox king (Seriously what is he wearing?) and I could also say the same about the look of Wiss too. Also I felt Trunks and Goten could of looked a little bit older but that is just only a minor nitpick.<br />
<br />
But anyway despite those nitpicks I felt that the most unique design was Birusu who has this Egyptian Siamese Cat God look to him almost resembling Anubis the Egyptian god of judgement which brings a lot more of a unique look to his character other than the typical generic steroid looking villains that we are so used to seeing in most Dragon ball movies.<br />
<br />
Sound - 7<br />
Not much in this music score stood out to me unfortunately. A few tracks suited some good moments and other scenes in the film including the original opening and closing theme performed by FLOW was good, however i found the music score at times to be quite generic especially with Goku turning into a super saiyan god. I didn&#039;t mind the heavy metal use in the fight between Goku and Birusu in the forest which was cool but apart from that, the music i felt wasn&#039;t really all that special.<br />
<br />
Characters - 8<br />
The characters are pretty much the same as always, there are a few changes in the behaviour of the characters like Goku, Vegeta, King Kai for reasons mainly due to the story which viewers will find out while watching it and not to mention some old faces that fans of the original <br />
dragon ball will remember from the past like Emperor Pilaf, Mai and Shu, But again 1 of the most interesting characters that stood out to me in the film was of course Birusu.<br />
<br />
Birusu is awesome, he isn&#039;t actually that evil as you think he is but he can be obnoxious. <br />
He is casual and easy going yet has a playful manner about his personality and a lot of swag which is not something you get in a lot of db/dbz villains<br />
he is quick to anger especially over pudding which sounds very silly. <br />
But believe me people I have seen MUCH worse.<br />
He is not only a powerful fighter, but he is also both quirky and entertaining at the same time which made me like his character a lot. Wiss despite his appearance also seems very calm and casual like Birusu not to mention A little mysterious at the same time. I kind of wish more characters were utilized a little more within the more<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 9<br />
The thing is honestly I love how different this film is to a lot of the other films in this franchise, there were interesting moments I enjoyed besides the action, there were some nice comedic moments of nostalgia especially for those who like the Dragon ball series with a few hidden stories closely related to the Dbz series which will keep fans interested. And most of the characters from the Dbz series are in this film too along with some old familiar faces which is Great, they might not get as much screen time in this film but at least they are there in the film regardless.<br />
<br />
Towards the end of the film it leaves off on a cliff hangar and one that will raise some questions from there on in. Also this film had some decent and memorable moments as well like for example Birusu final attack in outer space in the film which I like to call (Star Blaze of Judgement) which is basically like the sun being thrown at goku&#039;s face i have to admit was awesome! also (Bulma getting slapped by Birusu was also 1 of my favorite moments too ) I&#039;m sorry to any bulma fans out there but that had me in stitches XD.<br />
<br />
Overall - 8<br />
I would like to say personally I didn&#039;t feel this was the best DB movie but it is one of my favorites alongside Wrath of the dragon and Broly The Legendary Super Saiyan and a nice addition to the story itself.<br />
I know for some fans and others, its a Film where i feel its not going to be for everyone,<br />
sure there is some hiccups and plot holes I notice in a few places here and there<br />
which I can&#039;t deny that. <br />
But this did not stop me from enjoying it since it had many parts catered to fans of the series.<br />
<br />
Note: You should be aware that this is cannon material to the actual series created by Mr.Toriyama himself and for Db/Dbz fans its more than enough reason for this movie to be seen, Whether the creator Akira Toriyama would want to make a series or a set of movies or specials for the franchise only time will tell.<br />
<br />
But for hardcore fans looking for a Bunch of straight up intense explosive action (Its over 9000!!) well there is action but not as consistent enough to meet everyone&#039;s needs like some of the other movies, but despite that as a fan, the film is still worth a watch.

    Taking place a few years after the final battle with Buu comes a new threat, Birusu, The God of Destruction. He is feared by even the Kaious and Kaiou-shin himself. After a 39 year slumber (since the destruction of the Planet Vegeta), Birusu awakens and wonders how Freeza is doing and always talked about fighting him. Apparently, his assistant informs him that Freeza was defeated by Gokuu and that he obtained the form of Super Saiya-jin. During his slumber, Birusu had a dream about fighting the Super Saiya-Jin God and wishes to do battle with him. Always loving a good fight for the sake of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91889">
        the fight at times, Gokuu tries to challenge him but sees that he is strong and must find a way to defeat him. <br />
<br />
For a good percentage of this movie, up until the ending, this will follow the basic DBZ formula. I won&#039;t give away the ending, but all I can say is it does something very different and will probably be controversial amongst western fans of the franchise. The movie does a good job of justifying the way that it ends and I think this movie deserves credit for doing something different. On one hand, you don&#039;t really expect to see it coming, but on the other hand, it does make good sense. What you can take out of this ending is how we all interpret Dragon Ball and the spirit of it. <br />
<br />
Overall, this movie brings back a good portion of the charms of this series. The humor, the action, the intensity, and so on. So hardcore fans may enjoy this but the ending is very disputable at this point. Birusu as a villain is very distinct from other villains in Dragon Ball. I won&#039;t get too much into him since they would be spoilers, but I do think he is rather unique.  <br />
<br />
The action is pretty much in tune with how Dragon Ball Z always has been. Very destructive, explosive, and hyper paced. I wish in terms of special moves it was more diverse but it is more centric on hand to hand and the flying combat. I won&#039;t get into too much of what I think should have been used since they would be spoilers. The CG used in this movie isn&#039;t top notch. It is PS3 DBZ game quality, but the imagination I feel is what it counts. It demonstrates the devastation and the intensity very effectively and that is enough for me. <br />
<br />
As for Birusu&#039;s style, his posture is a lot like Freeza&#039;s where he will wrap his arms around his back but he will use hands while fighting. As for his mannerisms, he does remind me of Thanatos from Saint Seiya The Lost Canvas. He is very powerful and a bit of a show off when it comes to demonstrating his strength against the other DBZ characters. <br />
<br />
As for the general animation and design, its very much in tune with the franchise overall so no other complaints. <br />
<br />
The music from the TV series and old movies is not present and is mostly using new BGM tracks. The tracks are more techno and a bit more orchestrated. It brings a more fresher feel to the series and it works in its own way. The only ending spoiler I can give is that the ending song is a new rendition of Cha-La Head Cha-La which I thought was ok. <br />
<br />
The voice acting is still in tune with the original TV series. Nozawa Masako still captures Gokuu and doesn&#039;t sound like she&#039;s aged. She also does Goten and Gohan very well, too. She still has a great grasp of the character. Horikawa Ryo still does a great job as Vegeta, but due to the writing in context of the story, it does allow Horikawa to show more of his other voice talents in this portrayal of Vegeta. Horikawa Ryo is a very versatile actor and he did a great job of playing Vegeta. I think this is probably one of his best performances with the character. Last, Yamadera Kouichi plays Birusu. Yes, it is the voice of Spike from Cowboy Bebop. I didn&#039;t recognize his voice at all throughout the movie and when I saw the credits, I was surprised it was him. His voice as Spike had this really distinct charm to it while in this one, he is also a playful character but also something of a sadist. I think he captures the character in his own way where he is scary and also has his own distinct charm. Other voice actors are back that are still alive and reprised their roles did a great job with re-capturing their characters. And there will be some surprise cameos from some other characters. <br />
<br />
I say this movie is certainly a give it a shot movie for the fans. I say people not familiar with Dragon Ball Z will be slightly confused and some familiarity with the franchise should be a prerequisite before watching. Like I said, a lot of the things are still the same, and some things will be different this time around. I don&#039;t think it is as good as the first Brolly movie or the Cooler movies, but it does bring a refreshing feel to Dragon Ball at some capacity. I think when this movie is made internationally available, it will get people intelligently discussing about the movie and franchise based on the ending. I am still trying to in-take it but I do understand why the movie chooses to go with the ending it has but I do have some issues with it. But feel free to watch it when you can.

    First thing I just have to talk about is the art/animation... Seriously, I see a lot of people complain about the animation of the original DBZ series (though I personally love it and find it to be amazing for a 80&#039;s/90&#039;s show), well watch this and observe some of the best 2D animation in the history of 2D animated movies/tv shows. Seriously, practically every scene is accurately drawn, complexly shaded (as in they have shades, mid-tones, and highlights, whereas most 2D animations only have shades, and mid-tones - oh and One Piece where there&#039;s only mid-tones), and basically any other positive thing you can possibly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review112933">
        say about 2D Animation. Then there&#039;s the 3D CGI animation done for backgrounds when there&#039;s complex camera motion. Most people hate 3D CGI mixed with Anime, but I mean, it&#039;s way too hard to do with hand-drawing and get the accurate details in. In this movie, I found it all to be well done; other than that there isn&#039;t much to say about it.<br />
<br />
Now, finally, I&#039;ll talk about the story. Right before the Super Saiyan God part, it was 100% perfect for me. I wasn&#039;t keeping track of time, and so the entire movie before Goku came back to Earth felt like the intro to me. Now, that makes it seem like they spent too long on those parts, but I didn&#039;t find it to drag on, I was enjoying it. It just ended up feeling rushed when Goku got there. I don&#039;t know, it&#039;s like, you don&#039;t see Goku, and then suddenly, here he is and in a minute or two becomes Super Saiyan God. So yeah, that was my main problem, but I understand it&#039;s a movie (and an anime movie at that - they tend to be just over an hour) and so they have to try and get to the end pretty quick. If the movie was twice as long or even just 40 minutes longer, I feel this problem wouldn&#039;t have shown up. But yeah, just Goku&#039;s transformation feeling rushed was my main problem here. After that it was pretty much just Bills VS Goku, which was an epic fight with some real badass animation, and then after that was the ending, which I enjoyed and had no problems with.<br />
<br />
In terms of sound, I just didn&#039;t like King Kai&#039;s (Kaio-sama&#039;s) voice acting in the beginning of the Anime; everything else was good. Unlike the Anime series, there aren&#039;t any &quot;staying-in-your-head&quot; soundtracks except for the theme song that plays during Bills vs Goku, which I didn&#039;t think was needed, but it didn&#039;t do any harm - made it feel kind of..... &quot;AMV-ish&quot; I guess. <br />
<br />
In terms of characters, I love Goku&#039;s character in both the original series and in here. Also, Vegeta too; Vegeta&#039;s best moments are always when he&#039;s avenging his family and the part where he battered Bills after Bulma got hurt was pure badassery - though it didn&#039;t feel as serious as the scene in DBZ where he beats up Cell after Cell kills Trunks. And then of course there are the two new characters Bills and Whis. I liked Bills because he brought some comedy with him despite his title of &quot;God of Destruction&quot; and his immense power. And to avoid spoiling it for anyone who reads this without watching the movie first, let&#039;s just say the end of the fight is the ending of a fight that you probably haven&#039;t seen in DBZ since somewhere in the original Dragon Ball series; this is also something I like, because I preferred Dragon Ball and always wish maybe Akira Toriyama could someday do something with DBZ but takes it back to its original roots where Goku&#039;s friends are involved and every enemy isn&#039;t 100% pure evil. Oh and Whis is someone who has a lot of power but doesn&#039;t care to show it - it&#039;s not a new trait of a character within Anime, but I think other than Mr Popo and Master Roshi (in DB), this is a first in DB(Z).<br />
<br />
I enjoyed this; best Anime movie I&#039;ve seen to be honest. Especially considering it&#039;s a movie based on an already produced anime series, but then again, this is kind of different from Naruto and Bleach movies in that DBZ ended like 17 years ago. So yeah, I absolutely LOVED it, and hope there&#039;s probably more new Dragon Ball content coming in the future!

    Give me pudding or I destroy the Earth!<br />
<br />
Just when I thought this movie might be the rebirth of Dragon Ball, it presented itself as a lousy, high quality, piece of junk. Perhaps it was the initial hype from trailers that got me excited, but after thoroughly watching the movie twice, I just can’t seem to appreciate it. At all. But let us first get the good points of the movie out of the way since there are very few to talk about anyway. <br />
<br />
The animation is quite something. If only the recently remastered DBZ TV series could be completely re-animated like that, I’m sure the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review112999">
        fans will all wet their pants to see it. The CG used in flying and combat scenes were great. Not top notch, but still a welcome change especially when compared to the older DBZ movies. The remix of the popular theme song, Cha-La Head Cha-La, at the end of the movie give a nostalgia feeling. Talking about nostalgia, it was awesome to hear Goku’s voice actress, Nozawa Masako, still so lively. Brings back memories. Yeah.<br />
<br />
God, I never ever dreamt of the day I have to criticize my childhood favourite anime. Where should I begin? How about the plot? Except there is none to start with. Unlike other Dragon Ball movies that has a villain with a sense of purpose to do evil, this movie tried to steer away from that tradition. I applaud its attempt, but there is nothing good about it. What we have is a god that got bored and want to have fun. When things didn’t go his way, he naturally become this “evil” threatening to destroy Earth. Cool story, bro. What is missing in the movie is the struggle of our heroes and how they eventually prevail. Isn’t this what Dragon Ball has always been about? The DBZ fighters always give it their all and fight one bloody hopeless battle after another, all the while viewers cheer and cry and finally a miracle happens leading to victory. We see none of that here. Very disappointing.<br />
<br />
Not only is the plot non-existent, but the overall execution of the movie is just terrible. With a quarter of the movie dedicated to super minor side-kicks that most viewers simply doesn’t care about (not to mention their appearance serve no purpose to the plot), it felt like a complete drag to watch. While I understand people watch Dragon Ball for the fast paced action and cool fighting effects, this movie may have served its purpose in that regard, but it is a disappointment in every other category. This is just another sad case of milking money from an old established series by fooling loyal fans. Highly not recommend.

    Dragon Ball Z is Back! I was so excited to see this movie and it didn&#039;t disappoint. Not like that other piece of shit Dragon Ball: Evolution which will go down as the absolute worst piece of cinema I have ever seen in my life. But I&#039;m not here to talk about that I&#039;m here to review Dragon Ball Z: Kami to Kami a.k.a. Battle of Gods.<br />
<br />
The overall story is that Lord Beerus and his master Whis travel to Earth in order to find the Super Saiyan God for him to fight. After hearing that Frieza was defeated by Goku he decides to locate him

          <span style="display: none;" id="review172949">
        and challenge him to a fight. After kicking Goku&#039;s ass in their first encounter Beerus travels to Earth and arrives at Bulma&#039;s Birthday party and if he wasn&#039;t amused about with the Earth&#039;s culture, people, food, etc. he would destroy the planet. Vegeta then tries to make sure Beerus was happy, so he could make sure that the Earth doesn&#039;t get destroyed. However, after Buu wouldn&#039;t share his pudding with Beerus, he throws a tantrum and starts a brawl with the Z-fighters. Goku arrives and later summons Shenron, who is also scared of Beerus, and tells Goku that a Super Saiyan God does exist and how to become one. After his transformation he and Beerus battle to decide if Beerus will destroy the Earth or not.<br />
<br />
One major thing about this movie is that it is hands down the funniest DBZ movie I have ever seen. I mean there are so many funny moments in this movie. In addition there is kind of a breaking the forth wall joke in the beginning of the movie that got the whole theater laughing. The problem I had with this movie is how Goku becomes a Super Saiyan God. It was strange how someone becomes one, but it&#039;s even more strange on what they needed to turn Goku into a Super Saiyan God. Another, problem was Super Saiyan God itself. It just looks like a Kaio-ken. Even though it looks awesome with the reddish gold aura around him it wasn&#039;t that impressive of a design.<br />
<br />
The art is outstanding. This was something I wanted to see and see how the fight scenes were going to play out with the updated animation. And my god is its amazing. Now this is a double-edged sword because even though the animation was beautiful it was a little unusual to watch because the animation was so much different then what I remembered as a kid.<br />
<br />
The voice acting, as expected, was awesome. I mean come on it&#039;s Funimation and all the voices I remembered as a kid. However, got to give major praise to Manica Rial who wasn&#039;t the original voice of Bulma, but she did such a superb job that I didn&#039;t even recognize it.<br />
<br />
The characters are basically the same. The one I want to talk about is Lord Beerus. His design is like an Egyptian cat which was a good design seeing that cats were considered gods back in ancient Egypt. He is incredible powerful, but still not as strong as Whis. Not to mention he has the title of &quot;The God of Destruction&quot;. Beerus acts like a spoiled child, but acts like a gentlemen at the same time giving him a likable personality.<br />
<br />
Overall this movie was a blast. It was funny, it had action, it had badass characters... It&#039;s Dragon Ball Z. What else it there to say. If you can find this movie in the DVD section of a store I recommend you buy it. Not only that it was just a delight to finally have a new DBZ movie be released. Did it have it problems, Yes, but it&#039;s still DBZ being DBZ and it will always be awesome.

    First off, i&#039;ll make it clear that I don&#039;t and have not watched Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Z, however I know a considerable amount about the show aside from the gritty details, and anything I didn&#039;t know I simply asked my friend who was sitting right next to me. That said, the fact that I haven&#039;t watched DBZ didn&#039;t affect my enjoyment at all as you can see by the score I gave.<br />
<br />
Dragon Ball Z: Kami to Kami a.k.a Battle of the God&#039;s is an original story written by Akira Toriyama as apart of the Dragon Ball canon storyline. Right off the bat the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181893">
        fact that this film IS canon makes it more interesting to me, and the movie did such a good job of using the canon appropriately, introducing a new character; Beerus the Destroyer, as well as forwardly expanding the story with some things I won&#039;t spoil. Now the movie&#039;s undoubtably best aspect is that they combined the hilarious comedy and character interaction style of Dragon Ball, while at the same time adding the over-the-top crazy action of DBZ. As much as I wanted to see Goku kicking ass I simply loved the character interaction. The cast&#039;s chemistry was so good and seeing the voice actors reprise their role&#039;s with effort and emotion is such nice detail. There were some hilarious moments throughout the film, even during the action sequences which were fantastic. The fights didn&#039;t by any means drag, I feel people will penalize the movie for not incorporating a plethora of action but in my opinion the film had a perfect balance. Not only were the fights coordinated well, but they looked phenomenal in the remastered HD animation of DBZ. The animation wasn&#039;t the best i&#039;ve ever seen, but seeing the old animation style of the show being reverberated in beauty all while keeping it&#039;s 90&#039;s aesthetic is eye candy to me. The effects look as good as any top notch anime you&#039;ll see, Super Saiyan God mode looks great as well as the transformations and other CGI and particle effects you see. That animation coped with the original sound effects and soundtrack make for a pleseant bundle of fine details that add to the movie. Moving onto the plot, the incorporation of the new character Beerus, couldn&#039;t have been done any better as I mentioned before. He&#039;s not just some enemy that Goku will overcome adversity to beat so don&#039;t worry about any clichés in that sense. And Beerus himself is brought to life by voice actor Jason Douglas, and having a very interesting and unique character design. The film does a good job and making you believe he&#039;s insanely powerful, and I only hope I can see him again. The film was also structured very well, there was a sub plot involving Emporer Pilaf that I thought was a little unnecessary but in the end it did add to the comedy at least a little bit so I didn&#039;t mind. <br />
<br />
Overall I loved this movie despite not being a watcher of DBZ or Dragon Ball, the movie expects you to follow the story line, and I was able to follow since I know a majority of the story with the exception of the fine details. The story isn&#039;t over complicated though, it&#039;s very easy to follow and paced very well. If you&#039;re a fan of Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Z I highly recommend this to you, as well as the casual anime watcher if you know a decent amount about the show of course. If you don&#039;t like DBZ, this isn&#039;t going to change your mind. However I loved it and am now more compelled to watch the show.<br />

    Before asking yourself if you should see Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods, you should just answer this simple question: Are you a fan of the Dragon Ball franchise? If yes, then chances are you will quite thoroughly enjoy this film. If no, then it&#039;s rather unlikely to do anything to sway you over.<br />
<br />
The story of Battle of Gods is, as usual for Dragon Ball movies, exceedingly simple; Beers, the God of Destruction, awakens from his 37-year long slumber due to having received a prophecy that a powerful enemy would appear before him around this time, and, due to having had dreams of fighting a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review99869">
        certain &quot;Super Saiyan God&quot;, he and his servant Whis set off to find the few remaining Saiyans to see if they can meet this being. There are a few twists on the formula here and there, and the movie does rather refreshingly actually let Beers interact with the rest of the cast for quite a while before the fight breaks out rather than just saying &quot;OMG GOD OF DESTRUCTION! LET&#039;S FIGHT HIM FOR 85% OF THIS MOVIE&#039;S TOTAL RUNNING-TIME!!!&quot; but on the whole, the story of this movie is nothing particularly noteworthy... Which, according to staff interviews, was in fact Toriyama&#039;s intention, as he didn&#039;t want the story to get overly dark or serious. There are a few continuity-errors scattered about, (like how at one point Bulma&#039;s age is mentioned... and if she really was the age they claim she is, she would have to have been a kindergartener back when the series began) but they do not distract too much from the larger picture.<br />
<br />
Animation-wise, the 2D-art and animation is largely well done, with one sequence during the final showdown in particular being quite impressive, but unfortunately the movie also has a slightly annoying amount of 3D-animated backgrounds which sadly do not blend in with the 2D characters very well at all, and lends the movie a somewhat disjointed look. Also when I say there is one sequence in the final showdown that&#039;s particularly impressive, I do in fact mean that this minute or so is the ONLY legitimately outstanding piece of animation in the movie. Not that the rest of it looks BAD, but this is definitely not the best-looking piece of Dragon Ball animation out there. I will say though, that the CGI-effects used for various ki-attacks, as well as Super Saiyan God&#039;s aura, are quite impressive.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack was, for me, easily the weakest aspect of the film. The majority of the soundtrack just consists of uninspired synthesized music, and while FLOW&#039;s insert-song &quot;HERO ~Kibou no Uta~&quot; compliments the final showdown between Goku and Beers wonderfully, their remix of &quot;CHA-LA HEAD-CHA-LA&quot; also falls under the same category as the majority of the movie&#039;s instrumental music, in that the instrumental backing seems to be completely synthesized and the vocals reek of auto-tuning, which is quite disappointing considering how their energetic vocals have always been one of the band&#039;s defining features for me. But even putting aside my very underwhelmed reaction to the soundtrack as-is... This movie plays very heavily on nostalgia (obviously, being the first Dragon Ball movie in 17 years and all), so... was there really no way for them to get Shunsuke Kikuchi and Hironobu Kageyama back to do the BGM and theme-songs respectively? I mean, I suppose Kikuchi hasn&#039;t had any involvment with the franchise since the end of the Z TV-series and I don&#039;t even know if he&#039;s still in the business, but Kageyama is very much still active, and I would have loved to have gotten a new song or two from him.<br />
<br />
Character-wise... What is there even to say? It&#039;s Dragon Ball, written by the author of Dragon Ball, and chances are hardly anyone outside of the pre-established Dragon Ball fans would have much of an interest in this movie anyway. The movie does try and make sure all of the main characters from the TV-series make an appearance and at least one line, though sadly a lot of them don&#039;t really contribute that much... But then again, this story is set after the Boo-saga, and by that point, pretty much every single non-Saiyan character barely even qualified as fodder. That said, all the characters are very much acting in-character, and their interactions are definitely fun to watch and feel quite natural. Beers and Whis are also very entertaining characters, and they definitely stand miles above the average DBZ-movie antagonists, most of whom were just shallow knock-offs of TV-series antagonists with utterly uninspired designs. (Though Beers does have some definite shades of Majin Boo about him, but it&#039;s hardly blatant enough to the point where he can be called a ripoff of him.)<br />
<br />
As for the enjoyment, I already said this at the start of this review; If you are a fan of Dragon Ball Z, you WILL enjoy this movie. Sure, it&#039;s not exactly a deep, thought-provoking, complex story, or even an all that well-written one, but as a fun little revisit to a world that has obviously meant a lot to many people over the years, the film delivers magnificently. And really, at the end of the day, that does seem to be exactly what Toei and Akira Toriyama were going for here. And I for one was very much entertained, both the first and second time I saw the film. Highly recommended for fans, probably a decent enough way to kill an hour and a half for newcomers.

    Story<br />
So the story in this film involves Beerus, the God of Destruction, learning of the defeat of the galactic overlord Freeza by the hands of Son Goku. Seeking an opponent worthy of his power, Beerus, along with his companion Whis, travels to the north galaxy to challenge Goku to a battle.<br />
<br />
First off I have to say I really liked the story in this film. It wasn’t overly complicated or dark a moody, just simple stuff that is straight-to-the-point. The film felt just like the days of Dragon Ball with DBZ aspects meshed together, it felt so nostalgic and new at the same time and I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review134691">
        think that is due to Akira Toriyama’s involvement in the film as you can feel is presence here. One thing I didn’t expect was the amount of humour, much like the recent Iron Man 3, Battle of Gods plays the balancing act between seriousness and humour and for the most part it works. There is a lot to laugh at it is thanks to some good jokes and comedic timing when it comes to the dialogue and physical stuff. Another great thing about this film is all the ties to previous DB history whether it be flashbacks of verbal mentions, it is littered with references and I loved it. Now I will say that the story isn’t your straight-up action adventure, there is a lot of down-time and very silly moments throughout the film, some secondary characters also get ignored, some things happen to no consequence and there is an anti climatic nature of the film. Some of these elements will probably turn a few fans off but for me it wasn’t too much of an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
As for the characters they are all pretty much exactly how you remember them. Goku is still the loveable oaf who is super strong and always wants to battle the next strongest fighter. Vegeta is still the prince with a lot of pride and moodiness, but he is given a lot more screen time than I thought he’d get and has one of the most unexpected funny moments ever int his film. I also really liked Gohan’s contribution to this film, the return of Emperor Pilaf, Mai and Shou was very welcomed and Buu was another funny guy as well. Now let’s talk about the big new bad guy Beerus, man he was not what I was expecting, he’s like the nicest, quirky and most odd bad guy ever. He is very eccentric, lazy and confident, but he has anger issues and one small thing can make him switch like a light. I loved his more light-hearted side because it lend to some really funny dialogue moments. As for Whis, Beerus’ partner, he was very strange, but also funny.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art<br />
Considering how great Toei are with One Piece films, it should come as no surprise that Battle of Gods looks awesome. Everything is visually crisp, vivid, full of colour and the fluidity of the animation is INSANE with some of the most crazy dynamic tracking shots and camera angles that have ever been used for a DB animation. The character designs are also very nice, detailed and are familiar and yet slightly new. This film also employs Toei’s use of blending a lot of 2D and 3D animation and for the most part it works, though there are times I wish it was more 2D.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The soundtrack by Norihito Sumitomo is another aspect I like about this film, it is very good and suits every situation it is used in. I especially like it when the music when it ramps up and gets all epic when something serious is going down on-screen. Also the cover of Hironobu Kageyama’s “Cha-La Head-Cha-La“, the original opening theme of DBZ, by the rock band Flow is alright, it has its moments but it never gets as exciting as the original version.4<br />
<br />
Overall Enjoyment<br />
In conclusion Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods is a lot of fun and is another solid addition to the animated world of Dragon Ball. The film feels new but at the same time incredibly familiar thanks to its comedic tone, memorable characters and chaotic action sequences. Some fans may be turned off by the more light-hearted tone, villain personality and the overall ending of the film, but if you’re a true DB fan who enjoys this franchise then this is the film for you. It is all sorts of awesome.<br />

    I didn&#039;t have the highest of hopes after watching past Dragon Ball movies since they are quite nonsensical and non-canon but Battle of Gods changed this and gives new life to a staple of the Anime industry. <br />
<br />
The amount of fan-service in this movie is godly. You even have pilaf and crew making an appearance. The humour is certainly strong in this movie, it&#039;s very comical and brings back memories of the original Dragon Ball series. We have all our favourite characters and they each get quite a bit of screen time which is unusual for Dragon Ball Z which usually focuses on action and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review183176">
        fighting. This movie was a nice mixture of fun and action. <br />
<br />
The animation is absolutely gorgeous. The budget for this movie was obviously much larger than past movies along with the creativity. The character designs are very good and high quality but what most impressed me was the tactical use of 3D. The 3D is spectacular and blends perfectly with the 2D elements of animation. The colours are also very vibrant and in general, the colour pallet was good. The characters were all well represented.<br />
<br />
I love the theme music for Dragon Ball, the Japanese version and this modified theme song was perfection. <br />
<br />
The characters are great as usual. I don&#039;t feel the need to explain why you should like them because it&#039;s obvious that Dragon Ball has well developed and interesting characters. I would have loved to see Vegeta wear his pink shirt however. <br />
<br />
The movie was impressive and deserves a higher rating. My ratings for other Dragon Ball movies have been 6 or 7. My rating for Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z has been 8 but the quality of this movie is amazing. The animation is incredible, the time and love poured into this movie is obvious to any fan of Dragon Ball and thus this movie deserves 9/10.<br />

Story - 8<br />

    Overview:<br />
<br />
Did this movie have some large flaws? Obviously. Did I still enjoy every stupid minute of it? You bet your ass I did!<br />
<br />
Spoilers!<br />
<br />
Plot and characters: 6/10<br />
<br />
The plot is that the Lord of Destruction Beerus has awakened from his slumber and finds out that a Saiyan defeated Freeza. Beerus is informed that Super Saiyans now exist and this reminds him of a dream he had about fighting a &quot;Super Saiyan God&quot;. Goku must now reach a new form of power to give an entertaining fight to Beerus or else the shaved Egyptian cat God will destroy the Earth. For no reason, there is also a sub-plot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171161">
        involving Pilaf and his gang that was simply there. Here are just a few questions I had about this movie: How the hell did Pilaf get the dragonballs and wish for eternal youth without the Z warriors ever learning about it? Wouldn&#039;t they be concerned that someone not exactly good was gathering up the balls and making a wish? Why didn&#039;t Bulma recognize Pilaf? If this takes place 4 years after Majin Buu, why are Goten and Trunks the exact same ages? If Vegeta know about Beerus and knew that Beerus was by far the stongest in the universe, why didn&#039;t he ever mention him before? Why didn&#039;t Beerus recognize Majin Buu or ever mention him, when he was a MUCH bigger threat to the universe than Freeza ever was? Who the hell thought shipping Trunks with Mai from Dragonball was a good idea? Despite the many plotholes and ridiculous nature of the film, it is an entertaining watch that actually does a great job combining the humor of the original Dragonball with the action of DBZ. The movie also introduces Beerus and Whis, who are fun characters and actually feel new and not simply a rehash of Freeza, Cell, Buu, etc. <br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
<br />
The animators had a very difficult task in blending modern CGI with Toriyama&#039;s old school art style. However, they did a good job for the most part and I would say the movie looks pretty good...at least by DBZ standards.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
Not alot new, but we did get a snazzy new version of Head-Chala, so that&#039;s something I guess.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
<br />
The primary purpose of this movie wasn&#039;t to be deep or challenge our view of the world, but rather simply to be enjoyable. The movie accomplished this goal quite well and I genuinely was entertained throughout the film&#039;s rougly 100 minute run time.<br />
<br />
overall: 7/10<br />
<br />
Is this movie a masterpiece that all anime fans absolutely need to see right now?! No. Is it a fun movie that old time fans of DBZ will probably enjoy? Yep. This movie knew what it wanted to be and met its goals. I reward it with a nice 7/10.<br />

    I&#039;ll like to start off with a disclaimer for my review since I&#039;m sure some of you will flair up after seeing my overall score. I&#039;m a big fan of the dragon ball series with Z being my most favourite. The version of DBZ i grew up watching was the funimation dub that aired on Toonami which had the soundtrack composed by Bruce Faulconer. I believe that the enjoyment of this movie might be influenced by which version of DBZ you you have seen growing up; whether it was the sub or one of the two different dubs. Now with that out of the way

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113259">
        I&#039;ll start my review and please bare in mind that the types of DBZ movies I am used to watching are the English dub and a few more recent ones in English sub that does not have a dub for it yet.<br />
<br />
Story <br />
<br />
The story was a very poor one. Even though DBZ isn&#039;t necessarily known to have a good story, this movie probably has the weakest story in the entire dragon ball z series. I don&#039;t want to spoil anything but their enemy was not the typical bad guy that wants to rule the Universe by destroying those who opposed him. Instead what we have here is a bad guy that is bored of having a long life and just wants to seek out strong warriors to fight and blow up planets for fun. My description of the enemy might sound like an interesting plot but it was poorly executed in this movie. The movie dragged on with fillers in between that made me constantly check the progress of the movie to see how far am i from the climax or what was supposed to be an epic battle in the end. The final battle itself had some things in it that made no sense what so ever similar to when Omega Shenron used minus energy ball on kid goku in GT while he was holding the spirit bomb but didn&#039;t even scratch him. That kind of thing really destroys the credibility it had going up to that point. The conclusion was very disappointing and it&#039;s the first time a DBZ movie has ended like that but it does give a hint that there may be more movies and adventures ahead. <br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
The art work here was really good. It was similar the opening of Dragon Ball Z kai. My biggest gripe however was the CGI backgound they used during the final battle because it was out of place and very distracting but i don&#039;t think many people will find it hard to deal with and some might even welcome this but for me, they should have just stuck to the cartoon backgrounds they normally used in the movie and series.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
As stated before, I am a fan of the English dub dragon ball Z movies and I think the Japanese dub voices were a bad match for the characters and they were very distracting. The sound tracks used for this movie were almost none existent where it is dead silent at time with only the voices in the foreground. One of my favourite parts of the dragon ball z movies were always the epic sound tracks they chose for the movies to keep things exciting and to keep the viewers from getting bored in the slow parts.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
<br />
The characters are the same as you would expect from the DBZ characters. Trunks was my favourite this time because of how badly he wanted to look superior to Goten. I don&#039;t want to spoil this but Goku&#039;s newly found philosophy  contradicts his fighting style up until this movie where he would mostly rely on fusion or spirit bomb to defeat his enemies.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; conclusion<br />
<br />
The enjoyment of this movie is dependent on what version of dragon ball Z series/movies you grew up watching. If you were watching dragon ball z in pure Japanese audio then this movie will be more bearable. This movie distances itself from the usual dragon ball Z formula where this is not a serious movie and is around the same level of the one piece, toriko, dragon ball cross over episode that came out not too long ago which consisted of forced humour and a terrible story. This could be enjoyable or dreadful depending on the individual viewer&#039;s values but for me this was the worst animated Dragon Ball Z movie of all time.

    To view Battle of the Gods is to see something truly unique: a Dragonball Z full length movie that is completely consistent with the series, with a story designed by Akira Toriyama himself. The feel of the movie is unlike any other, the interactions between the characters is truly classic and feels every bit like the series. Rather than a random event out of time disregarding all continuity, everything feels genuine; because it IS genuine. <br />
<br />
So why isn&#039;t this movie hands down awesome? Why, actually, is it disappointing and substandard? Mostly because of the art, partially because of the failure at epicness, and a little

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113081">
        because of the acting. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not sure why, but the voice acting in this movie stands out to me many times... which is never a good thing. From King Kai&#039;s somewhat lackadaisical tones while the character animation is very irate and, well, animated... to Goku&#039;s ridiculously silly-sounding battle-cries, the voice acting is just downright dissonant with the animation at times. Though the acting for the new, and quite amazing, character Bills-sama is refreshingly perfect.<br />
<br />
The art, though, is what kills this in the crib for me. Everyone looks shiny, which is fine. Kind of reminds me of GT, which isn&#039;t so fine. The real problem is that the fight scenes are filled to the brim with bad 3D animations. It is jarring. One might even say that it ruins the whole DBZ experience, it certainly ruined mine. It&#039;s reminiscent of the switch in the DBZ games from Budokai 3 to Tenkaichi. If you liked that change, then you may not find the art to be as detrimental to your experience and may gain more enjoyment out of the film.<br />
<br />
Now, it is not to be said that there is no enjoyment to be found here. As I said before, it&#039;s a nice look at the post-Buu continuation of the world, and a heart-warming reunion with our favorite old characters the way they were meant to be. Yet the content does not quite live up to the epic name. There are no great moments, no really memorable feats, as a stand-alone film it&#039;s a bit of a letdown.

    I&#039;m a huge DB fan. Loved all three series and most of the movies. Till they put out this one.<br />
<br />
The story was very lame. But like most of the DB movies has little to nothing to do with the episodes.<br />
<br />
The art was great. It was a nice face-lift from the old.<br />
<br />
Sound was good, but if you&#039;re like me who grew up watching the dubbed versions you&#039;ll probably be pissed. From the very start of the series Son-Goke has been played by a person with a less than manly voice.<br />
<br />
The characters were nicely done again giving them a much needed upgrade.<br />
<br />
Now down to the enjoyment. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113263">
        would have rather sit through all the Naruto story fillers episodes than watch this. The opening wasn&#039;t bad But the fight scenes were quickly over and mostly lame. They try and make it to kiddy and kills it for the people that love the series. <br />
<br />
So it was a very big let down from all the wait for new DB.

    This is my first review so please bear with me.<br />
<br />
Dragon Ball Z is the show that marked an entire generation, it is easily one of the most beloved anime series to people from Latin America (the other being Saint Seiya). Suffice it to say this movie was met with great expectation. That expectation was met with mixed reviews, on one hand you have your die-hard hardcore fanboys who truly believe that everything that has &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; in it is shitted by God himself. On the other hand, you have people who love DBZ, and have come to appreciate the great quality this show is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review115199">
        known for. I consider myself from the second group.<br />
<br />
In story terms, I felt the movie was lacking. The main premise was quite attractive and gave way to what could have been and enthralling story, instead it was deeply hindered by an excessive amount of humour. Not to say humour is bad, but as it is with everything, you have to measure the amount you use, too much of something could spoil everything, happily this wasn´t the case, though it did diminished the overall enjoyement of the film.<br />
<br />
Come on lads! We all loved DBZ for its epic fights, the despair from the main characters when faced with overwhelming odds and the struggle to overcome those odds. In the movie, almost all of that magic is lost, giving way to a more casual approach (there is only one kame hame ha, for fuck´s sake, and no Genkidama!!).<br />
<br />
The art department worked just right with this one, though I´m not so fond of CG and animation mixtures, it didn´t hurt the production at all, it actually enhanced the animation in many ways. But still, I prefer one style for the whole work, call me a backwards-thinking individual, but that´s yours truly.<br />
<br />
One thing that has always been in need of great improvement in DBZ is the soundtrack. Sound effects are awesome, nigh perfect. But that soundtrack just doesn´t convey the epic feeling this show deserves. The movie is no different in this matter, using old tracks and new ones that resemble Disney´s musicals. Please do tell me who doesn´t enjoy the soundtrack of Naruto, Bleach, Fate (series), Fairy Tail, Sword Art Online and many more (their overall quality is another thing). I was strongly hoping for a more epic, symphonic soundtrack, sadly I was disappointed.<br />
<br />
Character progression is non-existent, I don´t complain since it is the fourteenth movie after all. Characters motivations, fears and psyche should be quite understood at this point. What I truly appreciated were the funny moments of the antagonist, but he did lacked progression, his character was just too plain. I´m mad; I fight, I´m happy; I eat...not great depth in this one.<br />
<br />
Being able to meet such high standards imposed by your predecessor is a difficult thing indeed. DBZ Kami to Kami struggles to keep up with the expectations delivered by the original show and movies (Broly should never be forgotten), its struggle is commendable but falls short of our great childhood memories. Not saying this movie is rubbish, it´s actually quite enjoyable, you will smile if not outright laugh. I say you should give it a try and enjoy the fond memories you had when enjoying this show.<br />
<br />
English is not my mother tongue, so I apologize for any and all mistakes.

    15 years after GT, Toriyama decided that he wasn’t making enough money from all the poorly created videogames, card games, and countless types of merchandise that were constantly being produced based on his badly written franchise. So, he officially labeled GT to be not canon, and that Super is the real sequel, in effect rendering worthless terabytes of fan fiction and fan art. He still hired Toyotaro as his best imitator and the one doing all the drawing, since he couldn’t be bothered to draw as he used to. The result was a lifeless continuation that could no longer excuse itself being bad because Toriyama

          <span style="display: none;" id="review383107">
        was not part of it.<br />
<br />
It was also not really a continuation, since that would demand a new story with new characters, in order to start fresh and avoid all the inconsistencies that piled up over the years. But who would buy that? We live in the age of sequels and franchises that reboot every few years. Toyotaro ended up tracing over Toriyama’s artwork, and kept rehashing the exact same shit, regardless of not making any sense. It was basically fan service for nostalgiafags and it worked spectacularly since many idiots ate it up immediately and called it amazing despite being a shameless cashgrab.<br />
<br />
So, everything began with a pilot movie called Battle of Gods. It was mostly comedy and had another terribly handled power-up. They had 15 years to take out the power creep which ruined the franchise, and not only they didn’t do anything about it, they instead made it even worse.<br />
-It was lazily acquired, since all it took was joining hands<br />
-It foddered everyone who was not a saiyan even further, since only saiyans could be used to unlock it and use it<br />
-It ridiculed the concept of SSJ even further, since at this point even a fetus could count as one<br />
-It foddered even the SSJs, since Goku became even more overpowered and in less need of everyone else to support him in battle<br />
-Visually, it was just a hair color-swap<br />
-Its abilities were never explained properly, as they kept changing every few episodes (untraceable aura, power output, healing, zero ki drain)<br />
-It was pointless, as it had no significance, didn’t defeat someone, and was quickly overshadowed by the next power-up<br />
<br />
The new villain, Beerus, was not even a villain, but rather a cosmic bureaucrat doing his job. Really badly I must add, since not only he slept for millions of years, he also wasn’t around to stop super villains when they were threatening the universe, and instead all he did was blow up planets that didn’t have tasty food. He was essentially a comic relief with ridiculously high enough power to destroy the universe with a few punches. And somehow they managed to screw up even this simple character by constantly contradicting what he did in the past.<br />
-He said he killed all the dinosaurs, although they still exist<br />
-He said he ordered Frieza to kill the Saiyans, but he never addresses it afterwards and even planned to kill Frieza for doing what he was ordered<br />
-The old kaioshin said he was trapped in the sword by someone weaker than Buu, although Beerus is stronger<br />
<br />
What baffles me is how they rewrote his backdrop story, from the one who made the Saiyans evil, to a generic destroyer of worlds looking for some excitement by fighting the Super Saiyan God. This removed the personal connection he could have with the heroes, since he would be the one who kickstarted their battle frenzy. Without that, he was just another guy who wants to fight for the sake of fighting. He even goes as far as letting the heroes turn Goku into a Saiyan God, proving how little he cares about the whole thing.<br />
<br />
And I have to point out the plot hole with the prophecy. The reason he knew there is a Saiyan God out there is because of an oracle fish which foretold it a million years ago. How can there be destiny in a universe with multiple timelines? Future Trunks came from the original timeline where everybody had died and it was impossible for someone to acquire the god form. Thus this whole concept was bullshit. The legend of the SSJ may have been a convenience for Goku to defeat Frieza, but it wasn’t contradicting the in-series logic, unlike the prophecy of the Saiyan God. And that’s why it’s proven once again why destiny and time travel are some of the worst plot devices ever conceived by man.<br />
<br />
Anyways, back to what was supposed to be a plot, the battle between Beerus and Goku was the most anti-climactic thing ever. Because of modern limitations, they couldn’t show gore and violence in the same volume as they could in the past, everything felt like a videogame because it wasn’t hand-drawn anymore, and the terrible low budget of the tv version made it laughable in the eyes of everyone who were simply looking for a cool fight. Many voice actors were also so old at this point, and couldn’t do their job properly. Kaio in specific can barely talk, so when he’s supposed to be screaming, nothing comes out. And even Goku’s voice actress shows her age too much at this point, you can easily tell it’s an 80 year old lady. How can you enjoy this?<br />
<br />
Not even the conclusion was satisfactory, since Goku lost, and Beerus did not destroy the planet because he liked the food. And he didn’t barely manage to overpower Goku either. Even in his god form, Goku was a billion times weaker than Beerus. Essentially, this battle was a troll, since there was no way for Goku could win despite making it seem he stood a chance. This continues the terrible tradition of characters holding back from using their full power right away, and making it seem like they are equal in power with whoever they are fighting.<br />
<br />
This first arc of Super was terrible. GT may have been awful for having no idea of how to use its good ideas, but at least it had good ideas. Not only Super does not have good ideas, it contradicts its own concepts every five minutes and keeps trolling you with fake tension. It doesn’t even deserve a 1/10, it was an abomination that should have never been made.

    Dragonball Z is another franchise everyone&#039;s heard of. People tend to either love it for its characters and action sequences or think it&#039;s kind of stupid because it&#039;s kind of a mindless action series where people scream to get stronger. Whatever your opinion on the series, Toriyama Akira&#039;s creation has certainly had a profound impact on pop culture. It also has over a dozen films. So, you may have wondered which one I&#039;m looking at today. Well, that would be the most recent film from just last year. Dragonball Z: Battle of  Gods. <br />
<br />
Story: <br />
<br />
The narrative begins with the Northern Kai talking to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review152323">
        Supreme Kai, using their long distance communication technique, about the awakening of the God of destruction, Beerus. Goku overhears, being on the Kai&#039;s planet for training because taking care of his family would not be fun and it&#039;s much better to wander off to distant planets where they can&#039;t find him. We cut to Beerus, who&#039;s waking up from his slumber. He and his companion, Wiss, discuss what&#039;s been happening with Frieza and Beerus learns that he was killed by a super saiyan. This reminds him of something he heard from the oracle fish, which is apparently a thing, about a Super Saiyan God. So, he and Wiss go on a mission to find out what that is. They start with Goku, whom Beerus easily defeats in a quick sparring match. Then they head to Earth, the Northern Kai warning Vegeta to not fight or upset Beerus, lest the God decide to destroy the planet. <br />
<br />
There are several things the movie does well. It has a great sense of humour. It&#039;s also really interesting to see Vegeta try to appease Beerus, even though you know it&#039;s Dragonball Z and it&#039;s only a matter of time until the fight sequence. I also do like that the ultimate resolution isn&#039;t what you&#039;d expect from the franchise. There&#039;s also one really satisfying fact about the film. It invalidates GT. If you&#039;re not a fan of the franchise, let me give you the short version. GT was a sequel to Dragonball Z that the original writer, Toriyama Akira, had absolutely nothing to do with. Most fans hated it. So, how does Battle of Gods flip this unwanted sequel the proverbial bird? Pilaf, Shu and Mai, three antagonists from the original Dragonball, appear in the film as little kids, having wished for youth at some unspecified time before. In GT the three of them appear as elderly and decrepit, while characters who are now older than them are just middle-aged. <br />
<br />
Now, let&#039;s go into the negative aspects. There are really two major narrative problems with the film. The first just doesn&#039;t make much sense. Why does the Northern Kai only warn Vegeta? I get the reason from a comedic perspective. It puts Vegeta in a situation where he has to try to keep this guy calmed down while no one else realises the danger. But from a story perspective, it doesn&#039;t make any bloody sense. Why tell the guy who&#039;s known for his bad temper  but not tell any of the people who could exercise a more calming influence? It&#039;s not like Piccolo or Gohan is going to panic because someone ridiculously strong is coming or they&#039;re going to deliberately antagonise him when they know the risk just to see his power. <br />
<br />
That brings me to the second problem, which is a bit of a spoiler. I know, I usually try to avoid telling you major plot details, but this one needs to be talked about. Basically, they discover that summoning the “Super Saiyan God” requires five Saiyans putting their energy into a sixth. That leads to a bit of a pinch. They only have five; Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Trunks and Goten. Enter one of the dumbest plot points I&#039;ve ever seen. Videl is pregnant and the baby is going to be a quarter Saiyan, so they&#039;re able to draw upon the... power of the fetus to complete the transformation. You may notice that your brain actually hurts from reading that sentence. Let me assure you, I am not making that up. I know, it&#039;s hard to believe that any franchise would do something that profoundly stupid, but it actually happens. <br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
<br />
Since Dragonball Z has a massive cast, I&#039;ll keep the bulk of the discussion to the characters who play an important role in the film Yeah, you see most of the major supporting characters from the series like Yamcha, Krillin, Tenshinhan, Chiaotzu and so on. They get very little dialogue and they don&#039;t do much. If you&#039;re a fan of their characters you&#039;ll probably be happy to see them otherwise you&#039;ll just notice that they&#039;re there. <br />
<br />
Vegeta gets some really good character moments in this. Actually, his entire family does. Vegeta, Bulma and Trunks all get some great moments and they interact with each other really strongly. Surprisingly so given that the film is only an hour and a half long. I also really like the Pilaf, Mai &amp; Shu scenes. They were really funny in the original Dragonball and this film sees their triumphant return. Beerus is also a great antagonist. He&#039;s hilarious and just a delight. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The art in this is superb. It has Toriyama&#039;s signature character designs with really detailed backgrounds. I especially loved Beerus&#039;s world. It looks amazing. The fight scenes are what you&#039;d expect with quick movements and flashy attacks. Although, being a movie, they don&#039;t spend nearly as much time with characters powering up or with moves that take a long time to charge. Which is frankly for the best since the fights in the series proper tend to drag because of that kind of thing. The fights in this are a lot smoother.<br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
<br />
Everyone in the cast is pretty good. The best performances come from Tsuru Hiromi, Horikawa Ryo and Yamadera Kouichi as Bulma, Vegeta and Beerus respectively. The music is also really good. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay: <br />
<br />
There is none. 1/10.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts: <br />
<br />
There are some really good things about this film. The comedic moments, the antagonist, the interactions with Vegeta and his family, the non-traditional ending and invalidating GT are all reasons to give it a watch. That being said, there are also some serious problems. The Northern Kai&#039;s decision to warn only Vegeta makes no sense. The fetus helping them power up is oh so mind-numbingly stupid. All of the characters who are in the background but neither say nor do anything important beyond giving Bulma&#039;s party a sense of size. Which is kind of a flimsy justification for their presence. Still, I would recommend it to fans of the Dragonball franchise and I did enjoy watching it over all. As such, my final rating is going to be a 7/10. Tomorrow, Film Festival week continues with something more... futuristic.

    In my opinion, this movie is not particularly bad, but there is for me two problems I can&#039;t put aside.<br />
<br />
First of all, and this is something recurring in DBZ movies, the logic of the original manga isn&#039;t followed, especially about power level. It might look like a fanboy complaint, but I undertake the critic. Why did Gohan is so lame? Why SSJ2 Vegeta is way stronger than Gohan? Why Buu is defeated in one hint? These questions have no response, and it&#039;s somehow a shame. The fact is due to commercial issues, Toriyama didn&#039;t follow his own story logic, and it turned the movie into

          <span style="display: none;" id="review115243">
        non sense. More than this, I&#039;m not convinced concerning the eternal quest of power. Super saiyan is supposed to be a very strong mode, super saiyan 2 an awesome one, and super saiyan 3 a dreadful one. Considering there is an amount of others forms even more powerful (Mystic Gohan, SSJ3 Gotenk, Buu gohan absorbed, Vegito..), I think it begins to become non sense as well.<br />
<br />
The second problem is concerning the tempo of the movie itself. The first half is quite good, but the other half seemed a bit weird to me. Maybe because contrary to Wrath of the Dragon or Fusions, the movie don&#039;t take a dramatic tone. It looks like the characters are taking a break by fighting Bills, and thus there is no real tension all along (and that&#039;s not by saying &quot;i&#039;m gonna destroy this planet&quot; randomly in the movie that it will add stress and tension..).<br />
<br />
But this is still a good DBZ movie, with some well animated fighting scenes, with badass transformations, and with a 2013 lifting.<br />
Though it never won&#039;t be better than the 42 tomes of DBZ.

    This Dragon Ball Z movie, really surprised me in a very positive way.<br />
When I began watching this, I expected a generic Dragon Ball Z movie, with a villain threatening Earth or Goku&#039;s friends.<br />
But what I found was so much more. It took a different route with this movie, which I really liked, and wish they would do sooner, or more of. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story is really simple, not to complicated for kids to not understand, but a the same time, enjoyable enough for old fans and adults to enjoy. And everyone that has seen or heard about Dragon Ball Z, should know what to expect. &#039;&#039;Fight

          <span style="display: none;" id="review138395">
        the bad guy, save the world, and save his friends&#039;&#039;. It&#039;s nothing new with this film(Although it take&#039;s it on a new twist, which I really loved).<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
And this is where the film shine&#039;s for me. Dragon Ball has always had a very lovable cast of characters. All the characters have been gathered, even Emperor Pilaf and his gang make&#039;s a very welcome appearance. And they simple put a new spin on all of them. And with that we get to see a different side of some characters, and some old one&#039;s too.<br />
Even the villain is very likable, and simple isn&#039;t there to destroy the earth, but to enjoy himself!<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound:<br />
I have never seen a better animated Dragon Ball than this. They went all the way with the animation and effects in this movie. The fighting scene was just amazing, with different camera perspective. I have never seen such a nice and clean Dragon Ball then this.<br />
I have nothing to complain about.<br />
<br />
Final Thought:<br />
To me, my biggest enjoyment was to see all the characters come together, and see what a great gang it really is. And watching Vegeta throwing away his pride, to save his friends and get mad, when Lord Beerus, hits Bulma. It is a all around a great movie.<br />
If you haven&#039;t seen Dragon Ball for a long time. This is a great way to re-experience Dragon Ball on. And put&#039;s a new whole twist on it all.<br />
And it really might surprise you. It certainly did me!

    The first DBZ movie in a long time and this is what we get. A film about the awakening of the God of Destruction, Lord Beerus, and his desire to fight a &quot;Super Saiyan God&quot; that he saw in a dream.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The film starts out interestingly enough with King Kai talking with the Supreme Kai about Beerus&#039;s awakening, and within a couple of minutes Goku has a fight with him where he is easily defeated as a Super Saiyan 3. Wanting to find out if anyone knows what the Super Saiyan God is, Beerus and his mentor, Whis, travel to Earth to find the other Saiyans

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113329">
        and ask them.<br />
<br />
First off, being the God of Destruction Lord Beerus is inherently evil, and yet while he is the film&#039;s antagonist the only reason he wants to destroy Earth is because he gets annoyed while on it, mainly from Majin Boo not sharing pudding with him. So the reasoning is stupid. Secondly there is no character development for Lord Beerus besides this. Even Freeza, Cell, and Boo from the main series had more explanation for their thoughts and actions. But here it&#039;s all over pudding and that Lord Beerus is supposed to destroy.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Second the fighting isn&#039;t amazing. There are no new moves seen here, unlike when Goku first became a Super Saiyan when he fought Freeza, pulled off the Warp Kamehameha with Cell, or when he became a Super Saiyan 3 and then merged with Vegeta to become Vegetto during the fight with Boo. All Goku does is turn into a Super Saiyan God, which makes him slimmer and have red hair. That&#039;s it.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The music was pretty nice, but not was more complimentary than additive which is to say it wasn&#039;t anything like Bruce Faulconer&#039;s music. But it was much better than Kai&#039;s or the original soundtrack for the show when it aired in Japan.<br />
<br />
Character Development:<br />
As for the characters, you have to have seen the main series to understand who everyone is. They didn&#039;t take the time to introduce all the characters for newbies to the series; this show is for those of us who watched the show when we were kids. However, Lord Beerus and Whis could&#039;ve been drawn out a LOT more.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Unlike the previous films, a good half of this film doesn&#039;t even have fighting. Ninety percent of the film takes place on Earth at Bulma&#039;s birthday party (her age I won&#039;t reveal here) and most of it is Vegeta trying to stop Beerus from getting mad and destroying the planet after hearing he defeated SSJ 3 Goku easily. While there are some funny moments, it&#039;s really just a bunch of filler for what could be an awesome, long fight with Goku and Beerus like in other films.<br />
<br />
The ending to the film is weak, but I won&#039;t spoil it but it could&#039;ve ended a LOT better. I&#039;ll say that the outcome of the battle is disappointing, but not terrible. But it&#039;s nothing we&#039;ve seen in DBZ before. However, being a DBZ film it&#039;s still fun to watch and reminds me of my childhood days from when I used to watch it after getting home from school, so I&#039;ll give the final score a 7/10. It&#039;s still DBZ.

    Warning This Review Contains Spoilers<br />

There is no question that Dragon Ball Z is one of the most well known animes out there.  From its humble beginnings on toonami along with its great action, it was cemented in the minds of many young anime fans.  And I was not one of those children.  While I did see DBZ playing every so often on cartoon network it never managed to hook me.  My cousins managed to get me

          <span style="display: none;" id="review183194">
        into it and watched kai while it was airing and it was exactly what I expected from the ancestor of the shonen battle genre, it had good fights, but nothing else really.  Eventually, I started watching the DBZ movies and they still gave me more of the same.  I was initially planning to skip this one, until a youtuber I follow recommended this movie.  After I watched this movie I can say with a bit of doubt this is the best DBZ film I have seen (and for reference I have seen both Cooler movies, super android 13, the first two Broly movies, wrath of the dragon, and the one with Janenba).<br />
<br />
The Story  <br />
<br />
The premise is simple, while Goku is training at King Kai&#039;s place King Kai senses that the god of destruction, Beerus, has reawakened and come to do what is  his title says, destroy, and as a sub-plot it is Bulma&#039;s birthday and some familiar faces from Dragon Ball are attempting to steal the dragon balls.  Also, Beerus eventually ends up at Bulma&#039;s party.  <br />
<br />
Now this story sounds simple enough, but based on how they describe Beerus it makes his actions not seem evil, but as a simple cycle of the universe.  They say destruction has to happen so more planets and species can be born after the ones  have been destroyed.  This really makes the conflict of this movie stand out compared to the other ones.  Goku isn&#039;t fighting space Hitler (Frieza) or a doctor with a revenge scheme (Gero and the androids), he is the literal embodiment of a natural force in the universe and life itself. I know this comparison is a bit hyperbolic, Goku is like Ahab in Moby Dick fighting against Moby Dick, an allegory for the force of nature itself, and as such it is portrayed realistically, Goku does not win, even with the god power up (yes it is named that) that appeared in this movie.    <br />
<br />
Breaking formula like this and applying realism to an already unrealistic world was a great change of pace and a  breath of life for this old franchise.  Its not perfect there is a stupid and kind of creepy side plot about Trunks falling in love with Pilaf&#039;s female minion (who is a kid for eventsI don&#039;t know about in Dragon Ball) and the nature of destruction and death is only touched upon briefly, but taking this knowledge into the final fight adds to the struggle.  The story is also rather slow with Bulma&#039;s party.  I didn&#039;t mind that, but I know some other will.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
      <br />
You still have your same cast of characters.  Most of the characters who aren&#039;t saiyans are still useless and most of the characters are there just for background. Goku is still kind of one dimensional blood knight.  <br />
<br />
I do however want to give special mention to Vegeta because his character was put in a different situation than the others.  When Beerus first appeared Vegeta realizes his overwhelming power (because of a flashback) and he is put in a state of fear and paranoia to keep Beerus happy and not angry so he does not destroy the planet.  Seeing Vegeta like this is incredibly rare (only acting like this in the first Broly movie) and portrays how Vegeta has gotten more of a heart after reluctantly turning good.  We also got a funny scene of Vegeta dancing to entertain Beerus in which everyone said https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_9mRXo-fYE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=8m26s and Vegeta getting downright pissed when Berrus hit Bulma.<br />
<br />
Now on to the two new characters.  Beerus is interesting compared to the other DBZ villains and other villains in general. I really don&#039;t know how to properly describe him, but I will try.  He doesn&#039;t inherently show off his power like the other villains and isn&#039;t blatantly antagonistic (unless someone pisses him off and I am looking at you Majin Buu). His power is so great when he says he will destroy you it seems like an inevitability and not a threat. Despite that he enjoys himself while he is on Earth and acts like a pretty nice guy. Hell the reason he doesn&#039;t destroy the Earth was because he enjoyed his time there (okay technically he delays destroying Earth, but that isn&#039;t for a long time).  I will also give mention to Whis, Beerus&#039;s assistant/tutor, who is calm and collected providing a good contrast for Beerus.     <br />
<br />
Animation <br />
<br />
The art and animation is higher than the DBZ series and the movies which makes the fights in this movie much cooler.  Plus, the effects on the god power up was pretty cool.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
The music is pretty good setting the tone and using a wider variety of instruments for each piece (and by that I mean each piece uses different instruments not that there are a lot of instruments in each piece).  Nothing spectacular though.<br />
<br />
Conclusion <br />
<br />
Overall this is a good movie from franchise that needed a bit of life.  It is a definite recommendation for Dragon Ball fans and for those who like shonen battle anime, but a solid knowledge in DBZ and Dragon Ball would be nice to fully appreciate this movie (since I haven&#039;t seen Dragon Ball, but I bet if you did have knowledge of Dragon Ball you would have liked the touches I missed).
