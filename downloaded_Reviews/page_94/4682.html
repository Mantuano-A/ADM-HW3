You might be looking at the preview image right now thinking &amp;quot;Ahh... It doesn&#039;t look that appealing&amp;quot;.<br />
Well, to be honest, I&#039;m not that fond of that drawing style, but don&#039;t let it discourage you! You&#039;ll get used to it, I promise.<br />

If you&#039;re looking for a &#039;super developed&#039; plot on how the world suddenly became and apple and how humans must find a way to turn it back, forget it.<br />
This is a very lighthearted Anime, it won&#039;t confuse you with its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1496">
        scientific theories and plot twists that make you go &amp;quot;huh?&amp;quot;.<br />
<br />
It made me cheer up from &amp;quot;Ahh, why all my anime suddenly feel so boring?&amp;quot; to laughing by the end of the very first episode.<br />
<br />
Now, don&#039;t get me wrong about the plot twists. They exist! They&#039;re quite good at holding the mystery for the right amount of time and unleashing it into a laugher bomb of amusement.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think they exaggerated or forced on either comedy, drama or romance. To me it was well quite balanced.<br />
And I liked the ending too, so yay!<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Quite simple:<br />
Before watching, just ask yourself if you must you fall in love with every Opening and Ending Theme you see.  I usually skip them  unless I do, anyway. (And so I did, in I My Me! Strawberry-Eggs). I guess you can figure.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
I know some people just skipped the whole review to read about the characters. But if you did, I&#039;m sorry to disappoint you, I won&#039;t get into much detail for the fear or ruining the surprise.<br />
They do develop along the series. Those very subtle changes in the characters&#039; personalities really made me fall in love with them.<br />
<br />
And, must I say, I had quite a few good surprises as the anime was reaching its end!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts on I My Me! Strawberry-Eggs<br />
As I said, a very lighthearted anime that will probably lift up your mood. It&#039;ll make you laugh, and who knows; even might make you cry. It&#039;ll amuse and surprise just when you thought it couldn&#039;t, and you&#039;ll slowly understand what makes it so good.<br />
<br />
I completely recommend it!

::QUICK REVIEW::<br />
Story: 5 (Typical funny trap situations)<br />
Art: 3 (I cant forgive uneven fingers and ugly ears)<br />
Sound: 6 (voice actors are pretty good but nothing else)<br />
Character: 6 (cute as hell but still drawn poorly)<br />
Enjoyment: 4 (Traps and perverted old men running gags)<br />
Overall: 24/50 = 4.8 = ~5.0 (A really mediocre SoL comedy)<br />
<br />
<br />
This is quite a confusing anime since it almost feels like it&#039;s trying to pull both male and female audiences using unorthodox means. First off, its a typical ecchi-harem anime and i use the word harem pretty loosely. Because after episode one the main character will be a trap. YES a trap (man dressing up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6625">
        as a woman). If you don&#039;t feel comfortable watching that sort of thing please feel free to drop it. Because you&#039;re not missing much. Don&#039;t worry, everything will set itself out in episode one. Including the perverted old men trying to sneak ecchi pics of school girls as a running gag. All this stuff is all fine and dandy, but I thought traps usually gear toward a more female or FYG-type audience. <br />
<br />
Once the story layout is exposed, it&#039;s all downhill from here. Every episode has been done in other school SoL (slice of life) anime. And they&#039;re not even done very well in this show. But for what it&#039;s worth the girls are pretty cute and moe and it does a fairly decent chemistry between Hibiki and his/her students. You&#039;ll also pretty much guess how the ending will be from the start as well. But the path from start to finish, despite it being very cliche with a trap twist, isn&#039;t all THAT bad but it fairly decent at best. <br />
<br />
Another thing that&#039;s lacking in this show is the art quality. Which is kind of important in an ecchi/comedy/SoL/school/drama/romance show. You can tell it has a mediocre style artwork to it with over accentuating character outlines and very VERY simplistic school outfits. Its one of the worst school outfits i have ever seen in ANY show, period. It&#039;s a weird tank top/skirt compilation with this HUGE white sailor collar covering their shoulders. I&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;re not supposed to be that huge. <br />
<br />
One thing this show does have going for itself is definitely the school girl characters. They&#039;re all cute and moe in their own way. And you actually feel sorry for some of their slice of life situations. It still doesn&#039;t help the fact that this show is very mediocre and and a lot of times just wrong (in &#039;funny&#039; ways of course). Its obvious this show is drawing a male audience with all the ecchi, but at the same time its pulling a female audience by how a man has to adjust himself to a women&#039;s lifestyle. If that sounds like something you want to see give it a shot. But if you don&#039;t like mediocrity in your story or art work stay far away from this one. There are a lot of better ones out there.

    Okay I hate to admit this and I really hate to admit this because I&#039;m a guy but this was a damn good series story wise, if it was redrawn and remade I sure as hell would enjoy it about a thousand times more as I&#039;m sure most people will think as well. So without any further ado let us review.<br />
Story- Like I said the story in this was great, the ending was a real heart jerker, and the laughs I enjoyed were pretty genuine. The only thing that prevented it from getting a ten was some lack of substance and how short the series

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7167">
        was.<br />
Art- Okay yeah this series definitely lost points with me here mostly because everything was not well drawn. I understand that this series is kind of old but I have to draw a line somewhere.<br />
Sound- Okay I liked the voice actors in japanese and the voices really did match the characters; in terms of sound effects they did a decent job there too so yay good job.<br />
Character- Well for the important characters yes there was some development but there were sometimes where I just felt uneasy as to what a character was like...what I mean to say is either the character was as easy to read as a book or about as readable as Latin is speakable<br />
Enjoyment- I liked this series a lot it wasn&#039;t my first experience watching an anime that was at least roughly based around school life but it was definitely one of my more enjoyable experiences; it actually makes me expect great things from school life based animes unlike some series which will remain un-named cough cough super gals cough cough.<br />
Overall- If you like a heart warming kind of story and enjoy a little bit of drama here and there I suggest this series if not I&#039;m not sure why else you would pick it up unless the aspect of a man cross dressing to get a job as a teacher is just your thing...

    I started watching I My Me! Strawberry Eggs four years ago. It was one of my first forays into anime tinged with yuri and crossdressing, both elements that have become more popular in the years since. Now revisiting and finishing it, I feel a very strong appreciation for a show that tackles rarely handled topics such as reverse sexism and above all, what really matters when you fall in love with someone.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, Strawberry Eggs fails spectacularly as a comedy. The jokes are stale, the timing is terrible, and the visual gags are just lame. Its only existence in comedy seems to be to keep the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19746">
        series light-hearted, because when it dives into drama, it tends to dive deep. No surprise given the premise involves a man who crossdresses to teach at a school that only allows women to teach falling in love with one of his female students. Barriers invoking melodrama include age, gender, and sexual orientation, as well as the negative stereotypes that men typically have to bear. These issues are handled quite delicately while both the teacher and his students, both operating under entirely wholesome premises, attempt to understand each other in an environment that breeds discrimination on unwholesome assumptions. The way these issues are tackled and resolved are Strawberry Eggs&#039;s true strength and with great fortune, is what it blossoms toward, especially in its incredibly impressive final stretch.<br />
<br />
The characters are also a mixed breed. No one really stands out besides Hibiki and Kuzuha, but everyone is a well-rounded character and no one is entirely a cliche. The characters, despite their lack of discernible personalities, never come across as fake... well, except the apartment patrons. They&#039;re a joke and have no real puprose or need for existence within the series.<br />
<br />
The art is decent, not necessarily pretty but certainly not ugly. I suppose &quot;tolerable&quot; would be the right word which is coincidentally (or not) appropriate for this series given its message.<br />
<br />
The voice work is impressive and passionate, especially Yuki Masuda as the female voice of Hibiki. However, the BGM and OP/ED accompaniments are beyond bland.<br />
<br />
In short, though looking rather uninspired and bland, Strawberry Eggs ultimately blossoms into something strong, thoughtful, and sincere. A real treat for series of this nature that proves in many ways that looks are not only deceiving, but also not what really matters.<br />
<br />
Overall, I give I My Me! Strawberry Eggs a 7 out of 10.

    &quot;Aiii Maiii Miiii Strawberry Egg&quot; is undoubtably, unashamedly aimed at those otakus that spend a lot of their time fantasising about unlikely, perverted romances. It doesn&#039;t bother trying to disguise this fact. The premises is a total farce: a newly qualified school teacher Hibiki Amawa wants to work at Seito Santomiya school, but there&#039;s just one problem: the school only hire female teachers because of the principal&#039;s dislike for men... and Hibiki is a man. So, in order to prove a point, Hibiki dresses up as a woman and is successfully recruited into the school. One of the female students Fuko Kuzuha soon falls in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23934">
        love with him despite Hibiki&#039;s appearance as a female teacher... and yeah, things gets messy from there on. With more fan service and hackneyed breaking of taboos to shake a stick at, I really ought to have loathed this show with a passion.<br />
<br />
But I don&#039;t. Despite all its shortcomings, &quot;Strawberry Egg&quot; actually exhibits a charm that is typified by the warm, sunshine opening theme (something that reminds me a little of &quot;Fruits Basket&quot;). But with the exception of a couple of episodes, this series is mostly predictable trash. And even in the episodes that are not pure trash, only a few moments truly shines out amidst the absurdity. The best example is probably the parents visit episode, when Hibiki, being a PE teacher, gets the parents to go on a run with their kids. The whole activity is hilariously bad - PE seemed like the only lesson of the day, as though there was nothing else to do; the runners were not told the route; people could just quit and go back whenever they felt like it; not to mention the idea that someone who&#039;s incredibly unathletic could just go and outlast the rest of the class through determination alone is totally unbelievable. It was clear that the whole thing is just a contrived set up for the scene at the end of the run. But when that scene came, I couldn&#039;t help but feel moved by it, even though everything leading up to it was so poorly thought through. There was another scene in the last episode, where Fuka gives a speech. Though the speech itself is terrible and the reactions predictable, again, I was touched by it.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the secret is in the two characters, Hibiki and Fuka, that the anime revolves around. Being the anime that it is, there is no shortage of thinly veiled excuse for fanservice moments and lecherous characters and their dubious activities, but through it all, Hibiki and Fuka both managed to pull off their roles rather well. It feels as if Hibiki genuinely has the welfare of the students in mind (unlike his lecherous flatmates), and Fuka also comes off as the sweet, caring individual that she&#039;s meant to be, perhaps due to some rather skillful voice acting. The only facet of her character that feels too cliched is the whole clumsy, constantly tripping routine, which is way too exaggerated and has been done far, far too many times already.<br />
<br />
Even though &quot;Strawberry Egg&quot; does have some subtle redeemable qualities, I really hesitate to recommend this as a genuinely good watch because, let&#039;s face it, it&#039;s not. It&#039;s a mostly manipulative show with a story progression that, more often than not, feels forced and shallow (something that&#039;s exemplified by the big &quot;twist&quot; at the end that made no sense). But it must have done something right, otherwise I would be treating it with a lot more distain that I am now. It may not offer anything intelligent to chew on, but it does provide some aesthetic pleasures.

    So this is my first review, and it is on I My Me! Strawberry Eggs.<br />
<br />
*SPOILER ALERT*<br />
<br />
At the beginning I was really put off by this anime, and I would be lying if I didn&#039;t say it was corny and trying very hard to be sentimental, which it did achieve to an extent. I think I would have liked it a lot more if they would have went with an innocence route and not put in the creepy fan-service. It is rather uncomfortable to see direct panty-shots and cleavage of fourteen-year-old girls. <br />
Even so, I decided to watch it any way due to the awesome concept

          <span style="display: none;" id="review117575">
        of an ambitious male youth cross-dressing as a female to become a teacher at a sexist woman&#039;s school. (Still kinda creepy, but...)<br />
It was interesting to see how this kid&#039;s viewed each other too. The girls had been brainwashed by the principle and vice-principle to hate men, and then the boys boycotting the school for gender-equality, because they were oppressed and forced to be the school janitors. The anime did express slight homophobia though, which I&#039;m not happy about, but oh well.  <br />
But the corniness dropped away as the anime progressed.  It was like a slap in the face when they discovered he wasn&#039;t a woman and actually Bra Man-san. I knew they would take it like they did. They assumed he was a filthy pervert. It was good they remembered him with appreciation at the very end there, though, and realized he wasn&#039;t. I actually really liked the ending. It ended appropriately and realistically. I hope him and Fuka will get together someday when she is older. <br />
the art wasn&#039;t that good. It really could have been better, but It&#039;s easy enough to adjust to. It&#039;s just that vintage style I guess. <br />
The voice acting was alright. I really liked how masculine the male lead&#039;s voice was. It made it funny when he used a female&#039;s voice. As for Fuka, her voice was incredibly annoying at the beginning because all the &#039;wahs&#039; and &#039;uhs&#039; she was making every time she stumbled made her sound like a baby, but I became used to it. <br />
I feel like the music could have been better, but it set a certain feel for the anime so it still worked. It was really pushing towards sentimental, especially the opening. It did work well at the emotional parts, though. <br />
As for characters, I think they could have fleshed them out more. Especially Fuka. They also didn&#039;t really touch much on the side characters. A few of them were just there. <br />
At first I really didn&#039;t like Fukae. He was a jerk to everyone he didn&#039;t like. And I didn&#039;t get why the Karate girl fell for him. When she tried to punch him out, he overpowered her and said she&#039;d never be able to defeat him because she was a woman. Wtf? But he really redeemed himself in episode twelve, and showed a lot of emotion. I liked him after that. <br />
I didn&#039;t like Fuka at all at the beginning, but she grew on me. Sure she tried hard at everything, but I just didn&#039;t like how helpless and defenseless they made her. I feel like she would be the first one to die if zombie apocalypse happened. Even so, she was certainly not weak. She chose to speak up for Hibiki, in front of her entire school. It was also brave and sweet how she decided to stay in the burning building beside her unconscious teacher. That is an intense love. <br />
As for the Hibiki, the male lead, they made him a really good person. Caring about heart over body, comfortable enough in his masculinity to cross-dress, caring about his students, protecting them, etc. And he became the most popular teacher in his school because he was so awesome. It just really made me uncomfortable how he fell for innocent fourteen-year-old Fuka(even though his mind was in an innocent place most of the time, despite the fan-service-y world around him)Though, he knew it was an inappropriate love, and didn&#039;t go for her in the end, so that&#039;s good. <br />
And I really, really loved the land lady! Who knew she was actually a man!(?) She was a badass, and kept the two creepy perverts in line. She was so tiny, yet was probably the toughest character in the show. And she was amazing in her mecha motorcycle. <br />
Lastly, the principle was sexist and horrible, but the vice principle was worse. I hated her pathetic obsession over exposing Hibiki as a man, and their plot to drive all the boys out of the school. <br />
Overall, I liked this anime, and recommend it. It confronted concepts like gender and homophobia, and ended on a bitter-sweet note, It was a good anime, and so I give it a well-earned 7. <br />

    Being a future educator myself, this story really warmed my heart. I admit, the story is a little bit stupid and, yes, VERY far-fetched. However, you have to be willing to keep an open mind and look deeper, because the truth is, this story is about love, gender equality, and acceptance of others and of the self. Specifically, though, it is about the equal treatment of MEN. I enjoyed that they focused on this, because these days everything is usually about women being mistreated.<br />
<br />
The art is nothing special, and neither is the soundtrack. It&#039;s like any other school kid drama in that aspect. I wish

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30670">
        I had more to say about that.<br />
<br />
Let me just get this out of the way: (without giving too much away) YES, the main relationship between two characters is unrealistic and inappropriate under all circumstances. I want to stress that I do not condone that kind of behavior from a grown man. However, to enjoy this show, you have to look past the creepy stuff because, after all, it&#039;s just TV. DO NOT WATCH THIS IF YOU ARE EASILY SHOCKED/DISGUSTED BY SOCIAL SCANDALS. Though you&#039;re all anime connoisseurs, so I&#039;m sure you&#039;re used to it by now ;)<br />
<br />
Weird stuff aside, I can say that the main protagonist, Hibiki, is one of the most admirable characters I have ever encountered. His goal in life is to become a gym teacher and change the lives of children for the better. When he enters Seito Sannomiya Private School disguised as a woman, he enters with the intent of proving a point to the man-hating administration: that people should be judged by their character, not by their gender. As for the school kids, they were actually a very realistic group of middle schoolers. You know.. hormonally messed up, unsure of what&#039;s right, impressionable.<br />
<br />
I think that the LGBT community (or anyone who supports) would enjoy this because it has themes about accepting sexuality. Really anyone who&#039;s into civil rights will enjoy this.

    Story<br />
The story kind of reminded me of Ouran High School Host Club. Haruhi had to dress up as a boy to pay her debt to the Host Club, while Amawa Hibiki had to dress up as a girl to be a athletics teacher for a school who has a principal a grudge against males due to a past relationship with a guy. Of course he will soon fall in love with one of his students which is Fuuko.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
There are a lot of different characters in this anime. There is a guy who dresses up as a girl, a klutz, a cool kid, crazy old lady,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7280">
        two perverts, sexist principal and vice-principal, and a tough girl. I find that really interesting to bunch up a ton of different character personality. With characters like these it became really interesting.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
I enjoyed all 13 episodes of it. The last episode almost made me cry but no problem! If only there was a 2nd season to this anime. There were a lot of scenes that made me lol, sad, angry and surprised. I hope you enjoy this anime like the way I enjoyed it.

    Hmm, what can I say? This anime really came up with something original. The humor in here was classic, with some funny situations that could only be obtained through the power of cross-dressing and gender confusion. The only problem was length, I would have liked to see the anime go a couple more episodes.<br />

8/10

    Yay my first review ^_^.<br />
<br />
Overall from the start, it has a good story going, abt an enthusiastic man wanting to be a teacher, but has to cross-dress in order to teach. The beginning of his career and towards the end was quite coherent, and was very entertaining and tear-jerking. <br />
<br />
However, the ending parts of this series left me a lot of questions, and there were quite a cliffhangers as well... seeming to lead to another season, but there doesn&#039;t seem to be one. Therefore i felt that the ending pulled the score down.<br />
<br />
Moreover, the romance between the some of the characters in the series were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23229">
        not fully expressed, so this story is not so much of a romance type but rather an inspirational and tear-jerking one.<br />
<br />
O yea, the op was excellent, as they show you a few snap shots of what is going to come up later on in the episode in the first few secs of the op. And the op was great, lovely song. I didn&#039;t like the ed so much though.<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed this series very much and I think it is quite rewatchable as well (7.8/10 for rewatchable-ness)

    Strawberry Eggs stings. It stings despite the excess of comedy. It stings despite the mediocre quality. It stings despite its stupidity. This anime was a wild ride, I can say. It&#039;s probably one of the best 6 stars I&#039;ve ever seen in my life. I My Me! Strawberry Eggs is more than a Yuri bait anime. It&#039;s a masterpiece.<br />
<br />
I started this anime because I wanted some more Yuri. Yes, I consider cross-dressing as a form of Yuri as well as it is technically Yuri bait. However as I progressed through the show I began to overlook all the Yuris and focus on the story instead.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343796">
        The story about a man who is determined to teach and change an extremely feminist school, so determined that he was even willing to cross-dress. <br />
<br />
The ending of this anime was a big sting as its unexpectedly realistic as hell and I did not expect it at all. This anime is a hidden gem and it talks about equality between men and woman along with forbidden loves such as student-teacher and female-female. It&#039;s a really great show and I think everybody should see it. <br />
<br />
For those who are thinking of starting this anime for Yuri as well : <br />
Yes, you technically get Yuri as the cross-dress looks perfect like Astolfo.

    First of all this anime is quite under-rated. It really disappoints me seeing the score below 7 on MAL. Anyways a darn good anime. You may question the art style but you&#039;ll get used to it but those ears... They creeped me out.<br />
The story overall is good .... Your every day cross dressing hum teacher who teaches at a school where men are despised ..... Hmmm seems good xD.<br />
Sounds and sync of the show was a little disappointing .... But the characters were brilliant .... You could see an average class with average student each different from each other ..... The characters seemed they were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241133">
        taken from a real story <br />
Over all i give this anime 7 at least if not more and I&#039;d definitely recommend it to anyone who likes highschool drama and romance..<br />

    Good question!  wot does the title of this Anime Have anything to do with the story itself?  Your guess is as good as mine.  <br />
<br />
At first when i saw this Anime just by reading the title it didn&#039;t sound to appealing to me.  i thought it was going to be some &quot;kid&quot; type anime...little magical girls in funky type costumes.  then after watching the first episode i was shocked! O_O  a cross-dressing teach, a gender bias school principle...and ah, oh well also the normal stuff like perverted old men, and a pushy old lady...which is surprising agile like James

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29408">
        Bond.  you can pretty much say that this is NOT your everyday middle school.  <br />
<br />
The Art work is great not too over exaggerated like other &quot;school&quot; like anime.  the character&#039;s features aren&#039;t blow up out of proportion, if you know wot i mean. ^_^ although, damn that boy can really dress up!  there are too many give away features that men have that are undeniably UN-HIDEable!  oh, please can you really hid anything wearing those tight short that the girls wear?! com&#039;on boys you know if that were any where near possible i think that would hurt you guys very much in the nuts! O_O oh, and damn...he would be that attractive just by putting in makeup...ok...i know wot you are saying.  in this day and age &quot;Newhalf&quot; people can.  But, agree to this that teacher is not one of those.  <br />
<br />
Over all, i did enjoy this Anime.  Interestingly funny i might say.   watch it! <br />
<br />
^_^ Enjoy!!!

    I thoroughly enjoyed this anime from start to finish.<br />
<br />
The characters were likable from episode one and the unique story kept me watching. <br />
I loved the concept of a cross dressing girl/boy relationship and was <br />
interested how they would go about doing it.<br />
<br />
I was worried that the concept wouldn&#039;t work well for the romance between the main characters, but it was executed beautifully and left no doubt in my mind that this series deserved a 10/10.<br />
<br />
I was concerned when thinking about watching this because it was made in 2001 and the art style didn&#039;t look amazing but I definitely have to say im glad I did

          <span style="display: none;" id="review237659">
        watch this.<br />
<br />
Overall I highly recommend this to anyone who likes the romance genre or if you like Yuri to watch this series.

    im late to the show, just finished it and 3 days later im still emotional wreck after the last episode, i really wish this had a full OVA or is given a second chance, i think with the current climate of gender discussion and the rise of streaming services it would do extremely well <br />
<br />
the whole season is a roller coaster of emotion,<br />
<br />
you can see that hibiki struggles with their gender identity all the way through the season, at first taking on the mentor role, then a motherly role and finally lover, the statement that hibiki was going away to figure themselves out is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309044">
        massive trans precursor for trans story line, the fact that they admit to enjoying time with the girls and feminine past times. i think the undercurrent from bachan shows that as a trans woman herself she could see it in hibiki.<br />
<br />
overall it has so far been one of my favorite animes along with Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru (The Maidens Are Falling in Love with Me) mainly because of the very well written gender understanding and friendship along with character development 9/10

    I My Me! Strawberry Eggs was a good series, it would have gotten a 10 in my book but there were some things towards the end that kind of bugged me. <br />
<br />
The story, as soon as you know what it&#039;s about has that &quot;Oh my... Got to see how this goes over&quot; reaction. First episode and I was hooked. VERY funny and the awkward situations made it funnier. But unfortunately, the further and further the series went the more serious it became... That&#039;s what I didn&#039;t like about the series. Realistically though, what all happened in the series happened just as it would in real

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27463">
        life.<br />
<br />
Art was typical, it was good art, but not bad. Though there were some parts in the series that they could have left some details out...<br />
<br />
Characters were weird... At least the main characters. True, they didn&#039;t have much of a back story, but they were well developed and had their own personalities. Some had a little too much of their own personality... x_x;;;<br />
<br />
Overall, a very enjoyable series, except the ending which I said went from comical to serious. Provided many good laughs and leaves you wondering what will happen next?

    Alright, so Strawberry eggs probably doesn&#039;t resonate with everyone. It touches subjects such as cross dressing, hebephilia and rabid feminism, which aren&#039;t exactly uncontroversial in the west (or I suppose in Japan). Even if you approach this series with an open mind, you&#039;ll still have to get past the whacky story, the wierd jokes, the fanservice... All I can say is that Strawberry eggs hits a perfect wavelength for me personally.<br />
<br />
Graphically it actually looks really good, especially for a high school anime, and even more especially considering it was made in 2001. Vivid animation, nice lighting effects and above decent character design.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205307">
        good enough, the OP and ED have both been in my &quot;good anime music&quot; folder for over 10 years and the background music is varied and fitting.<br />
<br />
Very few high school animes manage to pull off a good combination of comedy and romance, but Strawberry eggs hits a sweet spot. The story itself, despite the whacky themes, isn&#039;t ground breaking but it&#039;s well paced and directed, and inhabited with great characters. <br />
<br />
This happens to be one of the very first animes I watched, so I guess some of it comes out of nostalgia, but it has turned out to be one of my absolute favourites.

    Short review tiiiiime!~<br />
<br />
I went into this anime because I like genderbender. TRUE genderbender, not crossdressing. But even then, if they fall in line with my tastes they can still be pretty good like Ouran High School.<br />
At first I didn&#039;t want to see this anime because the MC on the front cover had the skin tone men usually have in anime, and he didn&#039;t look like he would fit the &quot;female&quot; role. Luckily he looks 3x better in the anime and pulls it off perfectly.<br />
The story was fun and sweet and they didn&#039;t overplay filler type sequences to where it got annoying. It had a bittersweet

          <span style="display: none;" id="review260249">
        ending in my opinion that makes me long for a season two, but this was made in 16 years ago so R.I.P. my hopes and dreams.<br />
The art was pretty good for 2001 anime so it isn&#039;t unbearable to watch.<br />
Same with the sound.<br />
The characters were likable, especially the MC. Character development was okay as well. The romance wasn&#039;t amazing, but it&#039;ll still ping you in the heart where it counts, especially towards the end.<br />
Overall I really enjoyed this anime.<br />
It&#039;s so hard to find a good genderbender anime. There&#039;s a whole bunch of manga out there, but in the anime industry it&#039;s like it&#039;s a rare breed of animal... Really glad I gave this a try.

    The show is silly just as its title sounds. I won&#039;t get into story details because most of people have written about it - a man starts crossdressing to get a job in a school to become a good teacher and make sexist female superiors realise that everyone deserves to be treated equally. <br />
Topics such as men-women relations, prejudices, sexuality and love are unwrapped in these 13 episodes. Even though the number of episodes wasn&#039;t enough to cover the topics, they were developed in both silly and serious way. Watchers are entertained and provoked a bit at the same time, to relate events to real

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256161">
        world situations.  I&#039;m sure you frequently encounter topics about gender pay gap in media or discussions, this anime is an artificial laboratory where such things are experimented and boosted to make bigger impression. How would society react if a principal of a school would said that only females should be hired as teachers or if a school superiors claimed that men are disgusting and only good for cleaning? Take that outside the school and apply to any institution or society. Also, the anime did great with those characters, they have double standards - they claim to be caring for society for the greater good, but they are nothing more than a bunch of hypocrites. The anime&#039;s school motto fits that well, it&#039;s about love (&quot;love for all&quot;? I cannot remember the motto well) while in reality it&#039;s not practised. In numerous moments we see school society divided about some questions and tensions between men and women, which is mostly result of older people (such as vice-principal) interfering and creating such bad atmosphere. The only thing those people don&#039;t know is that youth is suffering from their harsh guidance where they force their prejudices into heads of youngsters. <br />
Summed up, it&#039;s a decent watch - it&#039;s short and has funny moments which will poke you to think of some topics like gender equality. Too bad many people skip it because of its rating.

    So, I&#039;ve heard about this anime a long time ago (about 03, I think?), but I didn&#039;t think anything of it (though it has been in the back of my mind just because of the title alone). When I first heard about this anime, I thought it might be something like a Magical Girl Shoujo anime just from the title alone but when I read the summary, I found I was wrong. But still, the plot line of a man, desperate to become a teacher, crossdresses to do so after being turned down due to his gender. It was rather interesting, to say the least

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250618">
        and it kind of reminded me of another anime and manga called Gokusen which had a similar plot, only it was a woman born to a Yakuza (Japanese mafia/gang family) becoming a teacher at an all boy&#039;s school and having to hide the fact that she&#039;s a yakuza woman.<br />
<br />
I, My, Me! Strawberry Eggs has an interesting story and interesting characters, even if the animation style isn&#039;t what you usually see in an anime. I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
Story;<br />
Like I said at the start of this review, I, My, Me! Strawberry Eggs is about a man named Hibeki Amawa, after being refused a job as a teacher at a prestigious school with an all-female staff, requests the help of his landlady, Lulu, to get a job, which is by turning him into a woman. While this sounds like a comedy plot, the comedy in this anime is a bit... weak. And the drama that unfolds is the strong point, albeit, it&#039;s all rushed. There&#039;s no real story arc except for Hibeki constantly having to keep his true gender a secret from the feminazi of a principal and vice-principal. I used feminazi (albeit a bit loosely) because the head of the school and her vice principal are completely against men due to various unexplained reasons and that&#039;s pretty much it. Everything is mostly one-shot adventures until around episode 9 or 10 when a huge love triangle forms between Hibiki and a few of his students. <br />
<br />
Other than the close to non-existent story arc, what I, My, Me! Strawberry Eggs have is still an amazing story. It does have it&#039;s funny moments, most of the comedic moments are of Hibeki nearly getting busted for being a man or close to being found out. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art/animation isn&#039;t exactly breathtaking, but once you get used to it, it is pretty to look at. It has a lot of pretty scenes and the characters are animated fairly well, except for a few cases where they make some of the male characters that are perverted look even creepier than usual.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Well, the sound is pretty good. The English dub was.... let&#039;s say the voice acting was well done. The characters sounded exactly as I would imagine the characters to be and the voices convey exactly what the characters are feeling and going through, though I do feel Lulu&#039;s voice could&#039;ve been done a bit better. Other than that, I also think the opening and ending songs are a bit catchy. They&#039;re not the best openings and endings to an anime but I still find myself humming the songs out loud. As a matter of fact, the opening is stuck in my head right now.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Well, as I said, the characters are definitely drawn well and voiced well, but are they realistic and enjoyable? Are they developed? My answer is... yes, they&#039;re realistic enough for me to enjoy watching all the hilarity that ensues from Hibiki trying to keep his secret. All the characters have their own personalities, especially Hibiki, Fuko, and Lulu. As for the more supporting and background characters, they&#039;re distinguishable and enjoyable enough, but they don&#039;t stand out like Hibiki and Fuko do though. While I loved watching all the interactions between Hibiki and all the other characters, whether it&#039;s as a woman or a man, I do wish that there was more character development. Hibiki, Fuko, Akira, and Fujio are the only ones who get any kind of character development at all. It&#039;d be nice if there were more episodes for the other students to grow because there seems to be something going on between a few of the background characters that never get fleshed out. It&#039;s just a shame that there weren&#039;t more episodes to flesh out all the characters properly.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I enjoyed this show a lot. I mean yeah, the comedy wasn&#039;t all that enjoyable but the characters, the music, and the show... everything was really enjoyable. I enjoyed watching Fuko experience her first love and Hibiki trying to persuade the evil feminazi Principal and vice principal to change their minds about segregating the girls and boys and seeing him stand up for all of his students and encouraging them to do their best, as both a man and a woman, was really touching. As a matter of fact, I thought Hibiki was going to be a typical manly man who would be perverted and think of cross-dressing as disgusting, but nope. <br />
<br />
This show proved me wrong. It definitely tackled a lot of issues that normally aren&#039;t featured in animes, let alone a tv show. It touched upon, reverse-sexism, feminism, well the extreme version of feminism, cross-dressing, and of course, the one thing that makes us all human: Love. Of course, Hibiki does have a few perverted moments but honestly, if you were convince to share the same bed with someone of the opposite gender (albeit it was for one night lol) then you wouldn’t be able to help, but notice how the other person looks while being so close to them in a small space.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Overall, I would say this is a damn good anime. It&#039;s not among the best animes I&#039;ve watched, but it&#039;s not the worst by any means. The characters are all enjoyable enough, the plot, what little there is, is entertaining and lighthearted, and everything ties together... mostly. My only complaint is that the story could&#039;ve been developed just a bit more so that the characters could be fleshed out. I mean there was something in the final episode, something about the Headmistress, that had me very intrigued. While I feel that this anime is a bit rushed, I still loved it and I highly recommend it if you don&#039;t mind a slightly rushed plot or a short Slice of Life anime. But it&#039;s not recommended if you&#039;re looking for something with more depth and character development. Why do I say this? Because there are only 13 episodes of this anime and it has a lot of potentials to be a good lighthearted story with a smidgeon of drama to spice it up. <br />
<br />
So with that said, if you really are interested or don&#039;t think my review doesn&#039;t convince you to watch I, My, Me! Strawberry Eggs, then see for yourself why this anime is good at what it does.<br />
