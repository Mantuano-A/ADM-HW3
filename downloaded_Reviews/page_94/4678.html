    I&#039;m amazed that there&#039;s no review for this movie, especially as Golgo 13 is pretty well known in anime circles. But then again, anime that are over 25 years old don&#039;t seem to get much love these days, no matter how good or bad they are.<br />
<br />
Golgo 13: The Professional was released in 1983, a full 7 years after the manga by Saito Takao ended serialisation. During it&#039;s run the manga saw phenomenal success in both Japan and the rest of the world, with over 200 million sales in various formats. The series was adapted into two live action movies in 1973 and 1977, both of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19047">
        which were reasonably well received, but were not the successes that had been hoped for.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to 1983, and the release of the first anime incarnation of the legendary assassin Duke Tougou. At that time anime was still in it&#039;s infancy in the Western market, with much of what was being released were either Ghibli affairs, or shows that were deemed suitable for Western audiences. Then, Golgo 13: The Professional arrived on the stage, and nothing was ever the same again. <br />

It&#039;s often commented about how Akira opened the Western markets for anime, however what is often overlooked are the shows that came before it that gradually forced their way into how we in the West viewed &quot;cartoons&quot;. Golgo 13 was not only responsible for giving that door a good kick, it also had the added bonus of being made specifically for an adult audience, something which was almost unheard of at the time.<br />
<br />
The story follows the exploits of Duke Tougou, the legendary assassin known only as Golgo 13. He has been comissioned to kill one Robert Dawson, the son of oil baron and owner of Dawson Enterprises, Leonard Dawson. Although Golgo 13 is successful in his task, Leonard Dawson has sworn bloody revenge for the murder of his son and heir. Throw in the army, FBI, CIA, other assasins, mass murderers and a distinct lack of morals, and you have a recipe for something..... unique.<br />
<br />
The pacing and style in which the plot unfolds is actually very good, and is very reminiscent of the better class of action movie. Indeed, the writers took their cues from several action movies from both the East and the West, which is ironic as this movie has in turn inspired others, from Luc Besson&#039;s &quot;Leon&quot;, to Tarantino&#039;s &quot;Kill Bill&quot; (even the videogame &quot;Hitman&quot; pays homage to the whole Golgo 13 series in several instances). The whole story starts with an innocuously languid feel, which belies the breakneck speed at which it progresses later on. <br />
<br />
One thing I did like about the plot for this movie was that it wasn&#039;t simply about Duke Tougou, but was seen from the perspective of Leonard Dawson as well. His blinding rage at Golgo 13 is the main driver for the story as a whole, and is also what adds some drama and tension to what would otherwise have been a fairly one dimensional action movie. Another thing that separates this from the herd is the huge twist at the end of the movie as it adds a new dimension to the events that occur, and also explains a lot about Leonard Dawson as a character.<br />
<br />
Given the age of the movie it would be fair to expect animation to be subpar compared to most titles on offer today. That said, Golgo 13 was one of the first anime to make regular use of CGI, something which did not become prominent in the medium until the mid 90s. This is only used in certain sequences, however it is used to good effect on the whole. Some of the buildings and backdrops are clearly CGI, but rather spartan with the detail. Those that are not are nicely drawn and detailed, making them a decent canvas upon which the action can take place.<br />
<br />
The design for Duke Tougou follows very close with that of the manga and, using the manga as inspiration, the other characters were also created using Saito&#039;s foundations. The nice thing about this is that each of the characters have a certain &quot;believable-unbelievability&quot; about them, in other words, they&#039;re visually larger than life characters in the style of any good action story.<br />
<br />
Animation-wise, the movie isn&#039;t too bad on the whole. It is, however, reflective of the time, which means that there is often an over-emphasis on speed and movement (the use of speed lines for example), which can detract from a given scene. These techniques were used often during the 70s, 80s, and early 90s though, so their usage can be forgiven if one remembers that fact.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I&#039;ve only seen the English dub for this movie (one of the few anime I haven&#039;t watched in both languages - yet), but don&#039;t be fooled into thinking that this is a bad thing. The dub is actually pretty well acted, if a little wooden on the whole. Gregory Snegoff, who plays the role of Duke Tougou, has also played several other anime based roles, however this role was a challenge for him and the rest of the cast as they were effectively being asked to speak and act like no other anime characters before. <br />
<br />
Ultimately the dub is pioneering stuff though as it effectively paved the way for more adult oriented anime like Akira, Crying Freeman, Wicked City, Genocyber, AD Police, etc, etc, to be released on the Western market.<br />
<br />
The music an eclectic blend of pop, rock and jazz, with some strange quasi-classical pieces thrown into the mix. This seemingly odd mixture of style and content has meant that some people have found the movie to be less than satisfying, primarily because the music and the atmosphere sometimes don&#039;t mix. Although this may be the case in certain circumstances, it&#039;s my belief that, at least musically, the movie is well served by the majority of the tracks it uses.<br />
<br />
As far as characters go, one would expect Duke Tougou to be the one who gets the most development. Ironically, and fittingly, it isn&#039;t actually him who is the driver for the movie. That role belongs to Leonard Dawson who, in my opinion, is one of the better anime antagonists to appear fro the 80s. Dawson&#039;s blind rage over the death of his son pushes him to act in ways that are both morally and legally wrong, however his thirst for revenge overrides everything else. What is interesting to see in the movie is how Golgo 13 remains unchanged and unchangeable - forever the quiet assasin, whilst all the hatred, evil and invective happen because of Leonard Dawson, which poses an intruiging moral argument as to who is actually the monster in this case.<br />
<br />
That said, the other characters aren&#039;t really developed all that well, and some of the supporting characters are extremely stereotypical. Laura Dawson (the widow of Robert), is a case in point, as she seems to be a character with almost no backbone whatsoever, no matter gets thrown at her. The other characters are equally as poor unfortunately, with almost no depth to them.<br />
<br />
This is a movie with numerous flaws, however it works as a straight up action flick simply because of the conflict between Duke and Leonard. The acting may be wooden at times, but this can easily be forgiven as the action does make up for it.<br />
<br />
So, will you enjoy this? If, like me, this was one of the first anime you owned back in the 80s, then the movie will have a certain nostalgic feel, especially when we recall how cool the CGI helicopter looked back then. Likewise, if you&#039;re a fan of the manga, or the recent TV series, then this is a movie you shouldn&#039;t miss as it does do justice to the franchise. <br />
<br />
Action junkies and people looking for something with a bit more bite may also want to give this a try as, even with the flaws, it&#039;s still makes for pretty entertaining viewing.<br />
<br />
But if you want romance, friendship, comedy, or twinkly stars and rainbows, then steer clear. <br />

    Overview:<br />
<br />
When you think of the most successful and best selling manga series of all time, you probably think of stuff like: One Piece, Bleach, Naruto, Dragonball, etc. However, there is a manga that has been running non-stop since the 1960s! That manga is Golgo 13, and it is basically unknown outside of Japan. Golgo is one of those series along with Lupin 3rd that is not just HUGE in Japan, but at the level of cultural icon, yet they are utterly irrelevant everywhere else outside of Japan. In Japan, Golgo has sold well over 200 million copies, which is more than Rurouni Kenshin, Yu Yu

          <span style="display: none;" id="review183791">
        Hakusho, Attack on Titan, and Inuyasha...combined! Is the anime movie of this highly successful manga any good? Not really.<br />
<br />
Golgo is a badass assassin who kills without mercy and sleeps with all the ladies. He is a smooth, sociopathic killing machine. However, Golgo never evolved outside a crude ripoff of James Bond in 50 freaking years. He is never given a background even in the manga, so it goes without saying that you learn NOTHING about the guy in the movie. It would be OK if only certain details were kept ambiguous like where he was born, how he became an assassin, why he became an assassin, but we don&#039;t even know his basic likes and dislikes, let alone his character motivation. Golgo may be GAR, but he is possibly the most flat, one dimensional character in anime history. For many viewers, this kind of makes Golgo a tad boring. We know he&#039;s going to win. We know he&#039;s going to kill his target without getting a scratch on him and he isn&#039;t going to feel bad for killing him. Eventually even something as awesome as sniping people in the head gets stale and redundant.<br />
<br />
The plot is that Golgo kills the son of a very wealthy man, who had a mysterious hit order placed on him. The wealthy father than sends legions of guys after Golgo only for Golgo to easily kill them all. The plot in this movie is honestly pretty simplistic, apart from having one of the absolute STUPIDEST twist endings in anime history. I won&#039;t spoil it, but even M. Night would say that was head bashingly retarded!<br />
<br />
To be honest, Golgo 13 doesn&#039;t even have the cheesy 1980s charm to it that Violence Jack has. It is honestly quite boring. Seriously. A movie about a hitman popping people in the fucking head is boring! If you want to see a Golgo movie, I would check out the live action version with Sonny Chiba! Why? Because Sonny Chiba makes everything better! He rips people&#039;s balls off, has a black belt in Ninjutsu, and has eyebrows even bushier than Leonid Brezhnev&#039;s! Golgo 13 the anime movie is a mediocre waste of time, but it is never a waste of time to see what kind of over the top performance good ol Shinichi Chiba will turn in!

    As a person new to anime, Golgo 13: The Professional was one of the most recommended movies. It ranked in the top 5, along with Ninja Scroll, and later, Ghost in the Shell, Akira, Vampyre Hunter D, and other classics.<br />
<br />
Over time, the graphics have come to appear a bit dated, so i would only give it 8/10 for graphics (unlike Ghost In The Shell, there doesn&#039;t seem to be a remake coming), but this is mostly in the CG sequences and, considering limits of the time, overall, it is still well presented. <br />
<br />
However, the reason why I came to like this movie is because of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21010">
        the protagonist, Golgo 13. Without spoiling the plot, he is one of the most consistent &quot;heroes&quot; in a series ever (after this movie, there was a sequel, a manga series, a series of games, and even an anime TV series). <br />
<br />
To use one word to describe him: stoic. <br />
<br />
Golgo 13 does not hesitate, respond emotionally, or ever seem out of control, even when things clearly go wrong and he is in danger. This may make him sound dry (like, say, K. Reeves / Neo in The Matrix Trilogy), but he isn&#039;t. He is quite an engaging character.<br />
<br />
The story of this movie is somewhat simple, but the details make it interesting. In fact, that is one of the things that makes it worth re-watching... a lot happens in a short space of time, which doesn&#039;t feel rushed, but afterwards, makes plot development in other movies feel pale and unprofessional. <br />
<br />
The presentation style, from opening credits to ending, sets the tone for this dramatic action, which takes itself seriously without being boring. Furthermore, it deals with mature themes such as betrayal and murder (in fact, the lead character is an assassin). <br />
<br />
Okay, if you haven&#039;t ever watched this yet, then go out an do so now... although, actually, I prefer the sequel to this (Golgo 13: Queen Bee) for pure entertainment value, even though this is overall a better movie. <br />

    Trashy 80s action! Relentlessly visually innovative! Fun to laugh at!<br />
<br />
Golgo 13 is the longest running manga ever, super well known in Japan. He&#039;s an assassin who tends to kill people in impossibly skillful and unpredictable ways, usually with just one shot, he&#039;s the ultimate sex machine even though he barely moves during the deed and keeps the same stern expression he always has... which is hilarious. Especially because of those trademark colossal stern eyebrows. He&#039;s cool. Too cool. Emotionless, meticulous, unchanging and amoral. He&#039;s the hyper masculine ideal. His codename is Golgo 13 but the name he goes by from day to day is Duke

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204828">
        Togo, which seemingly everyone knows, kinda defeating the point of a fake name. Heh.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the point of Golgo 13 is that he is unchanging. He is a fact. Whilst it&#039;s great to see how he completes his jobs, the main point of Golgo 13 is the effect he has on other people. Take the main antagonist in this film - Golgo is unchanging and emotionless whilst this character is driven by sheer emotion provoked by Golgo&#039;s actions. This film will seem pretty disjointed if you don&#039;t know the basic premise - that the antagonist&#039;s son is killed by Golgo at the start of the film and as Golgo goes from job to job he is pursued by agents of the antagonist.<br />
<br />
Know this. Golgo 13: The Professional has the most relentlessly innovative interesting visuals I&#039;ve ever seen in an anime... Now, this is disputable, but I&#039;d say more than even Mind Game. The sheer number of things they do with light is astonishing. ASTONISHING. The anime industry has adopted cgi which this was the first anime to use, and the postcard technique where animation turns into drawn stills was pioneered here. *CORRECTION - IT WASN&#039;T, THE DIRECTOR USED THE POSTCARD TECHNIQUE A BUNCH IN HIS OTHER WORK APPARENTLY... MAYBE IT WAS POPULARISED HERE?* When the cgi comes, try to get into the mentality that you&#039;ve never seen cgi in an anime before. It is awesome. I know it isn&#039;t awesome from our perspective, but just pretend that it&#039;s awesome and you&#039;ll have a blast.<br />
<br />
This film is obsessed with reflections, presumably because the antagonist is the mirror image of Golgo, at least in the emotional department. It&#039;s a game in and of itself just to look out for the countless mirror-esque reflections shown onscreen. Whatever you do, DON&#039;T MAKE IT A DRINKING GAME. YOU WILL NOT WIN.<br />
<br />
This is a great film to laugh at. The villainous Gold and Silver alone are worth the ticket price. All the villains are great fun.<br />
<br />
The music is fantastic as well. Lots of smooth jazz and otherwise just perfect music to make everything seem oh so cool.<br />
<br />
This is a truly special and unique anime. That being said, the other anime film and tv series are definitely worth a watch too if you like this, but don&#039;t expect the same level of visual innovation.<br />
<br />
BE WARNED THERE IS A GRATUITOUS RAPE SCENE. IT FINISHES AND THEN A WHILE LATER IT COMES BACK TO IT. I&#039;M SORRY IT&#039;S A GREAT ANIME APART FROM THAT.<br />

    There&#039;s so much wrong and mindless about this movie that it&#039;s laughable. I was familiar with the premise of Golgo 13 by reputation among older anime fans, so I decided to sample this movie via rental from Netflix and I feel like I wasted 90 minutes of my life on this. The movie features titular assassin Duke Togo getting entangled in a corrupt business tycoon&#039;s plot of revenge when Togo gunned down his son when hired for the job. The whole feel for this movie is quite over-the-top with its very violent gun fights; confusing direction of plot; ridiculous action sequences where Duke survives ridiculously

          <span style="display: none;" id="review53663">
        impossible dire situations and making very impossible gunshots that will make you flush your disbelief down the toilet; the tycoon baddie being fanatically obsessed with killing Duke and a completely irredeemable scumbag; and Duke screwing every attractive gal he comes across in several sex scenes (also be warned that there&#039;s a rape scene as well in this movie). Don&#039;t expect to connect with any of the characters either as they are either too shallow in personality for you to care about and/or just serve as meatbags for Duke to kill off when they try to kill him. Some folks could even find this movie to be quite sexist with the treatment and depiction of women within the movie and the said mentioned rape scene.<br />
<br />
The visuals to this movie are quite outdated compared to modern standards with its rough details and sparse colors, though this is forgivable considering the movie&#039;s age. And despite how ridiculous I found the believability of many of this movie&#039;s action scenes were, the movie does have some interesting animated scenes it delivers such as the first-person perspective of a bullet fired from Duke&#039;s sniper rifle as it is about to pump a hole into it&#039;s unlucky victim&#039;s head; a split screen shot of Duke and his unlucky foe getting shot; and what appears to be the earliest CG animation sequence rendered in an anime as several enemy helicopters try to gun down Duke during a later action scene. The third example is quite rough compared to what you can expect of CG animation from modern anime titles, but I was surprised that something like this was done in an early 80s anime title.<br />
<br />
Beyond my praise for some of The Professional&#039;s animation methods though, the movie is otherwise a huge laughable mess of offensive content and over-the-top elements involving its characters and action scenes. Considering this is my first look into the Golgo 13 franchise, I think this will be my last look into it unless I get some very convincing arguments to consider venturing into other titles of the anime franchise otherwise.

    Golgo 13 is an underappreciated classic by the great Osamu Dezaki, one of the most important figures in anime history. Golgo 13 excels in not just one way, but in three. First of all, this movie is a masterwork of nihilistic neo-noir pulp. Secondly it is an auteur art-house film by a truly visionary director. Finally, it is a poignant meditation on the nature of evil. The three elements are all delivered masterfully and tie into one another with incredible coherency.<br />
<br />
Golgo is a stoic assassin with little to no personality. He exists to kill and get paid for it, and is always inexpressive and cold.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266953">
        He has allies and business partners, who he is reliable to, but there is no warmth in any of his interactions, even with the women he beds. He is entirely amoral – killing is merely his business, he is empty. People often criticize the movie and this character for just that – Golgo is not really a human being; he is an amoral power fantasy, unspoiled by any sort of accessible charm or sentimentalism. Dezaki was willing to play this character straight, despite him being entirely unsuitable as a protagonist for standard movie goers, who look to empathize with their ‘heroes’, or at least enjoy the appealing side of an anti-hero.<br />
<br />
There are no heroes in the world of Golgo, at most there are victims and victimizers. Every sequence exemplifies a grimy, desperate and corrupt late 70s dystopic atmosphere. Even bright scenes seem uncomfortably abrasive, as the light is always blinding and hard, and every landscape and person we see seems worn out. The music simultaneously has a kind of suave groove to it while sounding tragic, rough, and pained. At the moment I write this review I am listening to the song featured in the ending credits “Golgo 13 &amp; I”, featuring a sexy bemoaned chorus of “kill me, kill me once again” set to dirty jazzy J-Rock. It is incredibly evocative and fitting, as is the whole score.<br />
<br />
The story is paced and written bluntly, without any subtlety, and the plot itself is a simplistic sequence of violent and cruel events. The film achieves its powerful atmosphere with its absolute minimalism and willingness to abandon regular story telling conventions to maintain the purity of its vision of nihilistic cruelty. This is the ultimate exemplification of unmediated, brutal pulp, filled to brim with sex, violence (sexual violence as well) and hyper stoic masculinity. The world this film presents feels real enough that you can practically smell the cigarette smoke and gaudy cologne, and hear the tired desperate moans of its people as you watch it. I would liken it to an earlier take on Umetsu’s highly controversial and powerful “A Kite” in terms of its tone.<br />
<br />
At times character animation is used wonderfully to tell us what we need to know about characters without excessive dialogue, and the depictions of the characters are always highly detailed, often utilizing four or five tone shading for maximum dynamic effect that always matches with the inventive color palettes used to highlight the scenes&#039; mood. Golgo also utilizes a heavy use of hatching on the characters, which adds on an extra layer of grime to their presentation. The character designs themselves are hyper realistic, and Dezaki makes his women voluptuous and far more sexy and cunning than cute, something that makes me think of the female characters in Kawajiri works like Wicked City and Midnight Eye: Gokuu ,who have a similar aesthetic to them.<br />
<br />
What is most important about this film is that here Dezaki had come to perfect the style of limited animation that made him such a revolutionary figure in the industry back in the 70s (perhaps I will take this back upon seeing more of Dezaki’s later works, but this is clearly his style in its maturity). His sense of conveying atmosphere through color design and shot composition is unmatched here – as nearly every shot (not just scene, but shot) in this film is perfectly crafted to convey what it needs to. Dezaki uses visual motifs of reflective surfaces, blinding light work, and surrealistic, psychedelic, and nightmarish moments of emotional and physical impact to leave you breathless at every turn. This is of course also full of Dezaki’s signature postcard memories (sometimes in rapid fire), split screen sequences, and his use of complex background layering and motion to create immersive locations through the illusion of the parallax effect. Visually this is an auteur’s playground, and for this alone it could be considered a masterpiece, since Dezaki’s visionary approach has in many ways never been matched. <br />
<br />
However, there is 30 seconds of atrocious 1980s CGI that this movie has become famous for. At the very least the CGI sequence has an appropriate color design for the film, but the models used in the sequence are laughable. Still, 30 seconds out of a 90 minute movie is easy enough to excuse. The intro also utilized CGI, but surprisingly it worked well. It also really goes to show the degree to which Dezaki was willing to use this film as a playground for experimentation in animation. It is also worth mentioning that while structurally it is mostly successful there is an argument to be made for it overloading the story while new elements in the final third, which does make it seem like certain elements from the manga were thrown in just for the sake of appeasing fans, although it made the film less effective than it could have been.<br />
<br />
Finally, there is the thematic core of the film. In aphorism 146 of ‘Beyond Good and Evil’ Friedrich Nietzsche stated that “He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.” And nothing could more accurately convey the philosophical underpinnings of this meditation on human evil and resentiment. <br />
<br />
The main antagonist Dawson lost his son to Golgo, and the plot is based around Dawson’s attempt at revenge against Golgo. Golgo may be a monster, but he is an empty one, he is less than human. In contrast Dawson is the one who shows immensely human emotional outbursts and is constantly in a frenzy of pain and hatred throughout the film. Dawson becomes a far more horrifying monster than Golgo because of how human and relateable he is in his emotional agony, resentiment, and his need for revenge, and through his actions he winds up as even more empty and despicable than the man who he initially felt righteous indignation towards. Anyone who has comprehended the monstrous actions and attitudes of &quot;righteous victims&quot; throughout history and in our current historical moment will understand how much truth this message conveys.<br />
<br />
Golgo 13 is to my understanding the highest selling manga of all time, with its main demographic being an older male audience. It is something of a cult classic that has never really broken into the North American market. I cannot speak for the rest of the franchise, but Dezaki has caught my interest in the franchise through this flim. <br />

    The Professional: Golgo 13, I&#039;m a little biased as I count seeing this motion picture among my  happy childhood memories. The art is beautiful, a refelction of why we watch anime to this day. The simplistic beauty is enhanced by vibrant colors. But I want to take a moment to mention the soundtrack. I love the soundtrack to this film. It is the reason I started paying attention to who does the music in anime. It&#039;s 70&#039;s tyle stoic badassness and that&#039;s what makes it great. Only... having seen it dozens of times I can say watching it now; it&#039;s not really enthralling me.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review219864">
        Also it&#039;s NC-17 by today&#039;s standards. So it&#039;s not for those whose triggers require warnings.  Other than that, it&#039;s nostagia of the era that earne anime it&#039;s reputation for sex and violence. Bonus, today&#039;s the first time I&#039;ve seen the James Bond esque opening sequence for this film. I wish for beauty such as his.

    I’ve been wanting to dip my toes into the Golgo 13 franchise for a while now since it sounded cool, and simply chose to start here because MAL called it a prequel to the 2008 anime series. Now that I’ve finished this movie I can say that was probably only meant chronologically and should be changed since I doubt there’s any continuity, but I don’t regret my less common starting place. In this 1983 film, the professional assassin Duke Togo AKA “Golgo 13” is hired to kill the son of a wealthy oil baron. However, Golgo 13 has gone in over his head this time

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223899">
        as the father is mad with revenge over his son’s death, and the sniper soon finds himself under pursuit from one of the country’s wealthiest men who has even bought out the CIA and the Pentagon.<br />
<br />
Golgo 13 is a very simple concept. It’s an episodic format that takes the audience through the multiple hits of a legendary hitman who can do the impossible without fail. Despite Golgo 13’s impeccable skill, he does take damage and pain from his jobs to remind us that he’s human, and so there’s always some curiosity and admiration regarding how he’s going to get himself out of such dangerous scenarios even though we know he’s going to succeed in the end. Golgo 13 isn’t a complex character himself, a near mute man who is almost always wearing a poker face even when having sex with the countless women who instantly throw their clothes off for him (which makes the sex scenes just as hilarious as it sounds). But this basic premise belies what’s so appealing about this movie.<br />
<br />
Simply put, Golgo 13: The Professional has marvelous style. It’s a product of its time in the best possible way. Not because of common techniques of its decade, but rather an idiosyncratic style of direction that comes from a different pop culture head space than anything that someone would create now. It’s a movie that’s quintessentially 80s but twists that notion further to become something just weird enough to stand out among its time and also still possess a lot of character today. The movie’s opening consists of a bunch of images of computer-generated skeletons spinning around revolvers in strange poses that include holding their own head among other Halloween favorites. On a surface level it’s technically primitive CG being used for the sake of appearing modern that you can find in a lot of old animated movies, but this archaic charm only magnifies the weirdness of what it&#039;s actually constructing. The creepy macabre skeleton imagery that doesn’t fit in at all with the rest of the movie’s images, all juxtaposed with female-sung Japanese pop song that repeatedly says “pray for me” in English.<br />
<br />
Golgo 13 is a basic immortal assassin badass surrounded by a strange cinematic world that’s a perfect fit for the actual hyper-intense writing. The movie loves to use constantly shifting diagonal shots and inconsistently used editing techniques that add to the off-kilter narrative of insane violence and insane people. Golgo 13 is portrayed in a super serious hyper-realistic manner and yet he sometimes finds himself up against unexplained super mutant humans with randomly hideous appearances and abilities. One of which rapes a woman into losing her mind after he follows her around a locked room with corded desk lamp with a multi-colored glass shade that creates the only light in the pitch black room. There’s so much eccentricity to this movie that gives it a surreal nature, and in general it likes to play with a lot of contrasting 80s bright flashes of colored light added during editing that contrast with the heavily shaded comic book look that really accentuate certain details of scenes.<br />
<br />
There’s another scene where Golgo 13 has to fight off several men, but while this is happening footage is intercut of a woman peacefully swimming nude by herself in a lake while soft synthetic music plays uninterrupted during both the serene and violent parts. Golgo 13’s first hit in the movie has him targeting a cruise ship, and on the deck there’s a pool that’s in the shape of a casket where the oil baron’s son falls into after being shot. What seems like subtle symbolism takes on an even more clever meaning with the rest of the movie’s plot. There’s a part where a man falls from the top of a skyscraper, and this fall is portrayed in slow motion while gentle nostalgic ambiance plays and the camera rotates around him from several angles to give the real impact of just how far he’s falling, both literally and figuratively. Golgo 13 is extremely well-directed with many memorable frames and quirky techniques and lighting effects to make it all stand out. The movie also frequently uses still manga-like images that are drawn in a darker and more heavily shaded style than the rest of the movie to punctuate the hits of certain action scenes or transition scenes. <br />
<br />
Over all the action in Golgo 13: The Professional is a downright surreal experience that transcends a typical action movie plot. It’s unpredictably strange and loose with its construction and style while moving slow enough to not draw too much attention to itself. It’s a cool, acidic burn whose style drips off of it rather than burst outwards. It’s a lot of fun when it comes to its story and action, and charmingly unorthodox when it comes to its style that’s a mix of intelligent craftsmanship and strange 80s kitsch. While not a universal classic, it’s a movie that deserves more than historical respect and stands out today if you look at it with a curious lens.

    This is just way too kool man, this film is better than the entire new series of golgo 13, this is more hardcore, much better script, better lighting, much more effort put into this, music is way better, i gave art an 8 because theres about 30 seconds that hurts the eyes with the helicopters scene. apart from that the film is just a pleasure to watch. Great characters in this. if your a woman,or womanly man, stick to your new jap animation for little kids, but if your a man, watch this on youtube, right about now... peace

    Golgo 13: The Professional.<br />
<br />
To me, its was The Eighties: The Anime. <br />
<br />
Golgo 13, an assassin who lives by a samurai code and never breaks his word, shoots his way through a Sicilian mafia and uncovers that a mysterious organisation is trying to put him 6 feet into the ground. He&#039;s a mix of James Bond and Agent 47, which makes him even more badass.<br />
<br />
This movie has all the action you could wish for, and more. He pulls off seemingly impossible shots with his rifle, gets into fistfights with special forces and extremely sinister villains, engages in high speed car chases where he drifts round the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213531">
        streets of San Francisco, and makes love to several women whilst saxophones perform a romantic rendition in the background. <br />
<br />
All this whilst the art is gorgeously drawn, no shots are the same as Golgo 13 stoicly fights through the movie from beginning to end. However, there are some flaws to this movie. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s the worst CGI scene I&#039;ve ever witnessed near the end of the spectacle which ruined my immersion completely. I couldn&#039;t help but laugh at how out of place the CGI was. Did they run out of money for that scene or something?<br />
<br />
Another flaw was that they had spent the entire movie building up the 3 counter assassins who seemed impossible to kill and has Golgo 13 dispatch of them within minutes. On one hand, it does show how invulnerable Golgo is, but on the other hand it does leave me and possibly a lot of other people underwhelmed by how easily they were killed. <br />
<br />
All in all, this is a great movie to watch despite the flaws if you&#039;re big on action, mystery and maybe even romance and love the eighties as a decade.

    Golgo 13 is actually one of my first forays into motion picture anime and as such holds a very special place in my heart and for many good reasons. Duke Togo is still among my top 10 in terms of very dark anti-hero&#039;s and he is a big reason why Golgo 13 left such a big impression on me. <br />
<br />
The story is pretty simple Golgo 13, an assassin for hire, is contracted to kill the son of a big oil tycoon. As a result, the tables turn on the assassin and it all goes downhill from there. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s important to note the the art style

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252419">
        is dated and while other animations at those times stand up well, Golgo 13&#039;s unfortunately does not. The animation does have its moments but there were to many unforgivable still shots and often time shoddy animations that could have been done SO much better to relay what was happening at the moment. <br />
<br />
That being said, its a small complaint for much of what I felt was such a dark anime and what keeps me compelled is mainly the comparisons of both the antagonist and protagonist. <br />
<br />
The main character Duke is the assassin that you expect an assassin to be, an emotionless individual who understands entirely that death comes with the job, even with that being said, some of his actions gave me pause and in some ways were very unexpected. After all, I had no clue what kind of man Duke really was but you definitely find out by the end of the film. <br />
<br />
Giving the act of Duke&#039;s assassination, you may start the anime off championing the cause of the antagonist oil tycoon but as the story progresses the character may sway you in ways that your not going to believe. By the end of the film you are left to question who was truly the more righteous of the two and it is one of the main reasons why I enjoy the film the most. <br />
<br />
As far as the sound track goes, it&#039;s your generic 90&#039;s anime fare ,something that I&#039;ve always adored and never had a complaint for. <br />
<br />
Overall I enjoyed this movie and have re-watched it several times hoping to pick something else up I might have missed out on. This to me is still the best Golgo anime out of anything that has been made which is a shame because Duke is such an intriguing character to me and I would have jumped at the chance to see him at his most vulnerable moment if the manga did in fact have an arc that captured that. <br />
<br />
This film seems like it was close to vulnerable as it was going to get from the main character...and that is not really saying much as you will find out when you watch.

    Golgo 13 is a man among men. He is slick, hard faced and brutal, and only goes by his rules. He is an assassin for hire, and he&#039;s very good at his job. His latest venture has him going after a mafia boss lord named Dr. Z, after killing a mans entire family Golgo is hired by him to take out the entire organization. But once he gets involved with Dr. Z&#039;s daughter Cindy, a lushes goddess of a women who, like many other women, fall into his spell. But it seems Golgo&#039;s past is catching up to him, as he is being tracked down

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203662">
        by one assassin after another. From the mysterious and evil Gold and Silver, to the ruthless and bizarre Snake. Why has the ultimate hunter, suddenly become the hunted? <br />
<br />
A true staple of 1980&#039;s anime, THE PROFESSIONAL: GOLGO 13 is based on a huge manga series by Tako Saitou, this film displays the character to his fullest in terms of anime format. Golgo 13 is a bad ass, someone James Bond should inspire to be, in fact, he kind of reminds me of how James Bond should be. A cold killer with an unknown background. The film itself looks and feels like an 80&#039;s anime, with classic music and beautifully hand drawn animation. Everything from the city skyscrapers to the facial expressions of the very realistic characters. These aren&#039;t your big eyed, goofy looking &quot;cartoon&quot; anime characters. These look like real, chiseled people it&#039;s really quite extraordinary. <br />
<br />
A fun action film that doesn&#039;t hold back, another prime example of how anime isn&#039;t your child&#039;s cartoons. This film is full of bullet frenzy, head exploding violence with fully naked women and all. But I dug it a lot, its like one of those VHS tapes at Blockbuster way back when, with their anime section that actually had, mature adult anime. I was always fascinated with that section, and even though my mom would never let me rent them, I was always interested in them, I guess you could say that was my first real introduction into anime until I discovered Toonami. It&#039;s a bad ass ride, its wild and woolly. It&#039;s the sex, drugs and rock n roll of anime.

    Absolutely brilliant, Golgo 13: The Professional (1983) is slick, macho, and sexy. Directed by the great Osamu Dezaki (episode director of Astro Boy 1963-66, Dororo 1964-65, Ashita no Joe) it&#039;s another brilliant hit from one of the biggest anime directors of all time.<br />
<br />
Fun Fact: This is the first anime film to have 3D CGI<br />
<br />
Golgo 13 is the longest running currently releasing manga franchise of all time since 1968 (as of writing the 3rd longest manga ever made only under Dokaben and Kochikame) and one of the highest selling in manga history, yet Golgo hasn&#039;t recieved too many adaptations, only 2 films, 2 live action films,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review355166">
        and a 2 season anime from 2008-2009, which is shocking for a series so influential and popular.<br />
<br />
The series follows Duke Togo, Golgo 13, a gun for hire who always gets the job done, and that&#039;s all you need to know. He&#039;s quiet, always gets the ladies, and moves on once a job is over.<br />
<br />
The movie follows Duke after the successful assassination of the son of the oil baron  named Leonard Dawson, who throughout the movie tries to enact revenge on Duke using a genetically modified assassin named Snake, and is also aided by the FBI, CIA, and Pentagon to take down Duke. <br />
<br />
The presentation of this movie is phenomenal, from the opening scenes of Sicily&#039;s sunny atmosphere to the neon lighted nights of California, to the skyscrapers of New York City.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is utterly fantastic to the opening of &#039;Pray for You, an OUTSTANDING piece of music which stays in line with the theme and story of the film, with outstanding visuals and a lot of outstanding music that keeps the movies blood pumping macho atmosphere, or when it needs to a somber song to contrast with Golgo&#039;s murderous sprees.<br />
<br />
What ends in one of the coolest and flashiest final scenes in animation and action film history, leaves on possible stealth commentary on the macho/action films of the era with the final twist at the end.<br />
<br />
<br />
Golgo 13: The Professional is an outstanding and influential film that absolutely defines that classic 1970-80s macho era of storytelling and always keeps the hype, fun, and action flowing.<br />
<br />

    I finished the Golgo 13 series (50 episodes) and wanted to watch some more Golgo. To my disappointment, the manga does not convey the same emotions as the anime !<br />
<br />
I decided to give this 1983 movie a try. Surprizingly it was quite enjoyable, despite being more than 35 years old! <br />
<br />
If you like Golgo you will certainly like this movie. However remember not to judge this one as harshly as the anime you may see in the 2000s, as the animation is a bit dated and janky.<br />
<br />
The music is fantastic and very 80s though. Golgo, always the same : killing without emotion, sleeping with beauties

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287956">
        without seemingly enjoying it, living his life free of worries.<br />
<br />
Highly recommend for the fans!

Golgo 13 is an old anime, and for what I know, the manga is much older, a friend told me that it&#039;s one of the few mangas that were good in almost all the arcs, a manga that kept a good quality in storyes and all. <br />
<br />
Golgo 13: The professional, is about a professional murder, Golgo, who accepts contracts in order to kill people, the story starts when he kills the son of an old man, who is owner of a billionaire company.<br />
Now, what happens when you make an adaptation of a manga that contais

          <span style="display: none;" id="review355825">
        good stories with an animation that looks so rad, that it could keep you watching it hours and hours just for it&#039;s quality? Then, you got Golgo 13.<br />
The first aspect that calls your look, is the animation, the fucking animation, man. Honestly, it looks awesome, they got this camera plans that make the action more bombastic, the movements of the cars, the destruction, all looks incredible, and in general, it has a very good direction. That was the strongest point of the movie: it&#039;s direction, now, in terms of characters, they are simple, and you can perfectly forget them, but luckily, the movie is more centered in the protagonist, which is more memorable than the secondaryes, but not the best that the movie could had, come on, it could be better, he is more a plot device than a character.<br />
And I left the story for the end: It&#039;s simple, really, it&#039;s very simple, but it&#039;s well done. The final plot twist hits hard, and plus, the direction makes it even more epic, but thats all the good stuff, the rest of the movie is Golgo killing random people, while other characters hire asssasins and soldiers to kill him, in certain parts of the movie, this feels like filling content, so it&#039;s not so good. But yeah, if you are wanting to see a simple movie, with and story thats easy to catch, a magnificent direction and a well done plot twist, then this is your movie. Really, the direction worths it.<br />
<br />
This goes with a delicious seven, ma boiiiiiiii.<br />

    Duke Togo is an assassin for hire.He&quot;ll take almost any job at the right price.His latest assignment is to eliminate a crime boss by the name of Dr Z, a thug with almost limitless power and who&quot;s appearance is shrouded in mystery.His already difficult assignment gets even more complicated because after killing the son of the world wealthiest man he becomes public enemy number of some of the U.S.A most powerful government organization.<br />
<br />
Firstly this anime is more than just mindless { shoot to kill},the plot although straight forward has elements of mystery and betrayal where nothing is what it really appears.It has the action of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review72389">
         a war movie with the detail and finesse of James Bond.The action sequence are terrific with enough gore to satisfy anyone thirst.<br />
<br />
The music is mostly a mixture of slow to more fast paced jazz and really helped to compliment each scene quite well. The animation although quite dated with a few shoddy drawing and inconsistent animation still looked quite nice especially shots of the city and sex scenes{yes there quits a few of those}.<br />
<br />
I really liked the characters,they all came across as convincing and realistic with none feeling out of place.The main character code name Golgo 13 isn&#039;t the most charismatic lead in an anime but he has enough presence with his lone wolf demeanor to keep you interested. <br />
<br />
Overall a truly entertaining anime that&#039;s worth a look.
