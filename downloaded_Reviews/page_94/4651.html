    Rosario + Vampire the anime is the adaptation of a manga of the same name, or at least, thats what it was supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Story: I&#039;m trying to best not to rip this show apart but bear with me, Tsukune is your unfortunate high-school male who has just been enrolled in a school he doesnt even know when his parents found an admission pass on the ground by accident. Little does he know is that the school is for monsters than hate humans and would prob kill any on sight. It is when he meets Moka, a beautiful girl who in reality is a powerful

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3606">
        vampire. What I just wrote was basically what you would get introduced with on the first episode, everything was cool then. As the &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; moved on, I slowly started to get irritated at the EXCESSIVE amount of panty shots this anime had. Now I enjoy fanservice every now and then like any other guy but in this show the fanservice was given to you in large and unnecessary quantities, a girl could be standing doing nothing WITHOUT EVEN WIND BLOWING, but they would still show you her panties for no real reason. I thought this was just another one of those fanservice shows so I didnt really wanted to hate this show for that reason. Around ep 5 I decided to pick up the manga as well since I heard good things about it, it was then when I realized what a mess this anime had become. They turned a good manga with interesting plot and good action, into a fanservice driven anime that had tunned down the action and REALLY changed the storyline just to turn it into an ecchi comedy. Also EVERY episode follows the same old formula, If I could describe a R+V episode it would be as follows:<br />
Tsukune meets Moka<br />
Tsukune meets an antagonist<br />
Tsukune gets in trouble<br />
Moka tries to help<br />
Tsukune accidentally removes Moka&#039;s rosary<br />
Vampire Moka beats everyone up<br />
Everything is happy again<br />
This same formula is applies for every episode of this show with exception of the last 2 episodes, which were good on its own right but still managed to butcher the goodness of the manga. If you watch animes to get a good story you wont find it here.<br />
<br />
Art: As terrible as the story is, this anime&#039;s best feature was its animation. The colours were all great and the animation was fluent everytime. I failed to notice any sign of quality drop throughout the show. I will give this show props for that.<br />
<br />
Sound: It wasnt bad, nothing really out of the ordinary. The ED song was really good though....IMO the best part of every episode was the end credits XD<br />
<br />
Character: The characters of this anime are likeable, well Tsukune is the typicial guy who tries to help but ends up being helped instead because of its uselessness. Moka&#039;s normal form is a contrast to her vampire form as one is sweet and friendly and the other is rough and swift to act. To be honest my only motivation to finish this show was Shirayuki Mizore aka Ice Girl. Voiced by Kugimiya Rie it was nice to see her use a non loli voice and well the character itself IMO is awesome. She could&#039;ve been the main character :)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I&#039;ll keep this simple, I didnt like this anime. It was hard to finish some episodes and then try my best not to drop it right after. Its safe to say I will not be watching the second season if they havent learned their lesson on this one.<br />
<br />
Overall Rosario + Vampire was a rather disappointing show considering how Gonzo had a really good source to work with but decided to ruin it in order to bring ecchi comedy and pointless plot. If you are the type of person who likes this kind of ecchi comedy and mindless fanservice then R+V will be a good show for you to watch and I recommend it for you (also rejoice as a season 2 will be coming). For someone who likes a good story, dont bother, this anime is not worth it.

    &amp;quot;Side tracked from its original story and ended up being a half-baked series.&amp;quot;<br />
<br />
Before we begin, let me drill this into your mind. Fan service; Fan service; Fan service; Fan service; Fan service! That&#039;s the theme for this anime so don&#039;t start having high hopes for an amazing story or what not (at least nothing in comparison to the manga original). Rosario + Vampire, like many manga-to-anime adaptation series, made fans screamed with joy at first, but only to have their hopes and dreams shattered bit by bit as the anime progresses. It is true that the anime&#039;s story plot deviates from its origin, but it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10390">
        is also true that the artwork is astounding (the animation version of the characters look more attractive to me). So let us get into a deeper analysis of Rosario + Vampire.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The anime is considered pretty episodic (ie. standalone episodes) with a few exceptions near the end of the series. This goes parallel with its manga originals so it is nothing new to the readers. However, what is new is the extremely formulaic sequence in all episodes with an introduction to the &amp;quot;monster of the episode&amp;quot; (these monsters tend to get defeated and then become friends with the protagonists). Not only that, but the actual story coverage is also very minimal in the anime (only covered up to chapter 10 of the manga out of 40 chapters). But that is not to say it is all bad. In fact, certain portions of the story that were remade into anime were better planned (events flow smoother/made more logical sense) than the manga version. Overall, the story serve its purpose as an introduction to the Rosario + Vampire series.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
Consistent animation quality throughout, beautifully animated characters, plus smooth transition from scene to scene, what more can you ask for? Gonzo, while not exactly known for extremely high quality animation (at least not at the level of KyotoAnimation), does indeed proved itself a worthy opponent to other studios in the industry.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
OP and ED are both very enjoyable for me (I didn&#039;t skip them like I did for a lot of other anime). It should not be an annoyance to you either (I hope). As for seiyu, there are many talented and well known professionals to voice for our pretty girls (and boys). For instance, there is the cute Rie Kugimiya voicing for the &amp;quot;icy cold&amp;quot; Mizore, and Saeko Chiba voicing for the &amp;quot;very funny&amp;quot; Ruby. <br />
<br />
I would like to bring the attention to Nana Mizuki who is the CV for our super hot/cute/pretty/gorgeous Moka and also the singer for the OP and ED of the series (and the singer for Capu2 as well). Nana is not only famous in the seiyu community, but is admired by all. She has an amazing ability to sing (even rivals those so-called &amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; singers) thanks to her powerful singing voice despite being a pretty tiny girl. She was also the winner of the &amp;ldquo;Best Musical Performance&amp;rdquo; award in the first Seiyu Awards. For those who have not yet experienced her excellent character voicing ability (and as a singer), I strongly suggest you give this series a try. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Aside from the fact that most character&#039;s hidden abilities were not included in the anime, the show did a pretty good job with the characters. Plenty of character developments and showing their inner feelings toward each other (especially near the end when certain secrets were discovered). In addition, the interaction between the many different types of monsters can be quite refreshing from the traditional harem-oriented anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment + Final Thought:<br />
Judging Rosario + Vampire solely as an anime, it has plenty of ups and downs. Judging it as an adaptation from a manga, it was pretty disappointing except for the animation and sound department. I recommend this to all people who have not yet read the manga (got some nice fan service), but for those who know the story already, you might want to skip this and move on.

    Rosario Vampire is a typical male targeted anime filled with comedy, ecchi, and action. Typical school comedy with typical jokes associated with high school comedies. The &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; twist for this show would be that this school happens to be a school for monsters. To twist it even further, a human is accidentally accepted to the university and if he&#039;s found out he will literally be killed. Reading from the other reviews it appears that the manga had a &amp;quot;real story and plot.&amp;quot; ...lets think about it for a second. How can someone take a story so serious about a boy trying to survive a monster

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4255">
        school? Regardless, this review will be biased based on the anime and not being tied to any book. <br />
<br />
As I was saying, this show is about a human boy accidentally being accepted at a monster school. But on his way there the literally gets hit by a beautiful girl on a bike. Long story short, he finds out she&#039;s a vampire (hence the title), they hook up and the adventure begins. The episode structure is typically built the same for every episode: Story + new character + problem + fight = one Rosario vampire episode. Some shows don&#039;t pull that formula off very well (Jigoku Shoujo Season 1) but R+V does it pretty good. Each episode is very different from the last all thanks to being a high school full of monsters. Being a Japanese anime, it would be easy for them to follow the normal Japanese way and make their own random monsters. Thankfully, they pulled MOST of their monsters out of typical folklores and old wives tales like vampires, succubus, witches, etc ...with their own anime twist of course. At least they use east and and west references instead of making their own which is very refreshing. But the story line isn&#039;t the shows strong point....<br />
<br />
This is an ecchi comedy and you will figure that out within the first 15 seconds of watching the show, that it&#039;s more ecchi than comedy. And the only way to be a successful ecchi show is if the art and animation is top of the line, this is where the show shines the most. All the backgrounds are hand painted with care. They even designed the school to resemble a Gothic style building with excellent accuracy. All the main and background characters are drawn with such perfection only an ecchi fan can understand. Every girl is drawn beautifully and have their own style. It even looks like they borrowed a few things from the book of Tenjo Tenge: Hairstyles, miniskirts, fighting, and even Moka acts alot like Aya Natusme But then again, they do pull off a few subtle spoofs and parodies. <br />
<br />
Speaking of characters they&#039;re all very ...addicting. As an ecchi comedy they covered all bases of moe. You&#039;ll most likely get addicted to one or more of the main characters or villains. And to top it off, their voices are so mind numbingly addicting, you&#039;ll practically melt. (Kappuchuuu~). Apparently it&#039;s a requirement now that if you have fan service characters, their seiyu&#039;s have to have their own music cd. Each girl does have one and they even have some songs posted in the show. Be sure to look out for Kimiko Koyama (I&#039;m listening while writing this ^_^) As for the op and ed songs, they fit perfectly for what you would expect from an anime titled Rosario Vampire. Other than the great music and great seiyu cast, the sound effects are pretty standard. <br />
<br />
Sure theres alot of fanservice in this show...it is an ecchi comedy after all. I don&#039;t understand why people are so surprised. This is the 21st century, movie/tv adaptations NEVER follow the book/manga. So haters should get over it or they will be constantly let down for the rest of their lives. Take this show for what it is... a fun ecchi comedy with great characters, fun fight scenes, and hilarious fanservice. I sure hope this show will last a few seasons.

    R+V is an ecchi anime that has been received surprisingly good in my eyes. I mean, the only thing that makes it different are the elements of action which have found their way into each episode. It starts out with Tsukune Aono, the typical ecchi wimp main. He is starting high school, and due to some strange circumstances he ends up getting admitted into a youkai academy. On his way there he bumps into gets bumped into by a beauty, who&#039;s actually a vampire. She&#039;s supposedly one of the beauties in school, so you know what&#039;s coming... yeah, she ends up befriending the wimp, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11657">
        hangs out with him all the time. But of course, she isn&#039;t the only one; soon there comes a girl who wants to steal him away, and on top of that, a tiny brat, tags along with the group, and there you have it! Standard ecchi setting deluxe!<br />
<br />
The story fails to impress in any way aside the inital setting as well. Each episode brings about a new (mis)adventure for the group, which basically goes like this: Tsukune gets into bad company -&gt; Hangs out with the girls -&gt; The bad company comes to them -&gt; The three girls kick ass + Moka transforms -&gt; Tsukune whines -&gt; Everyone gets happy after kicking ass -&gt; End. And that&#039;s about it. The only refreshing thing is that it&#039;s actual action here, and that there&#039;s new youkai taking the role of bad guys every episode. But aside those, nothing worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
The characters are just about what you&#039;d expect: The moe girl, her rival, a small girl (loli?), and the wimp they all stalk to death. Unoriginal, boring and non-developing, that&#039;s pretty much what there&#039;s to say about the characters. Both the recurring side characters and the ones who get renewed each episode brings out nothing specuial; they&#039;re just standard filler for their position, be it teacher or bad guy of the day. The only slightly refreshing thing was that Tsukune seemed like he wanted to actually help out in the fights, instead of being a wimp and passively receiving whatever assaults of love the girls threw at him. Props to him for that.<br />
<br />
The art department was okay, but nothing bragworthy. The backgrounds were nice, yet a little artsy, and the character designs, whuile generic, were pleasing enough. The action scenes were animated nicely, and no slumping in the special effects department either. There was too much fanservice, however.<br />
<br />
The sound was pretty okay, and fit the series, but it was by no means anything special, and none of the tunes really captured me or made the scenes better. The OP and ED themes were good enough, fitting the series&#039; atmosphere and all, but nothing more.<br />
<br />
All in all, R+V is a failed attempt at an ecchi series, with plain characters and a boring story, but with an action element that served as decently refreshing and allowed for some plus points scored by the pathetic wimp main. And there&#039;s lots of fanservice, be warned.

    Rosario + Vampire is a typical Shounen, Supernatural, Harem, Romantic, Comedy about an average, human, high school boy (Tsukune) who couldn’t get into any private schools and was stuck going to a school for monsters. This may sound interesting but there’s nothing particularly special about this set-up, since it is just your average school Rom/Com but with monsters. What’s more is that each episode has some very predictable outcomes that get boring fast (monster appears, Moka transforms &amp; sucks blood). So in the end, the weak and repetitive story turned this into a series that you can only enjoy once you turn off your brain.<br />
<br />
There’s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2486">
        nothing unique about the characters, seeing how it does the same old thing; by having yet another “loser-kun” male protagonist and surrounded by hot and cute girls. Their personalities usually match the way they look as well, so don’t expect anyone to really stand out in this series, except maybe Mizore (snow girl). <br />
<br />
The quality of the animation is probably the best aspect, as the backgrounds and environments completely suit the ever changing horror atmosphere. Also everything is somewhat fluid, from the bouncing breast to swift action sequences. The music is also well done, especially during the short burst of action but it becomes fairly repetitive.<br />
<br />
Overall Rosario + Vampire proved to be a somewhat entertaining Rom/Com that quickly turns into a typical harem, full of everything shounen (misunderstandings, ecchi, nosebleeds, etc.). Apart from the supernatural element, everything else is the same as in any typical school comedy with the usual cliché situations we are all used to seeing. Fans of the manga will most definitely feel let down by the series, as it never managed to deliver the same story the manga produced and instead all it did deliver was an excessive amount of fanservice (100 panty shots per episode). Some may still enjoy this while the rest will wonder why you wasted your time on such a show.<br />
<br />

    Okay then, where to start? How about the fact that this was made by Gonzo. Now, before you go jumping down my throat, yes, Gonzo has made some really, REALLY good series, and are still making them today. However, they also have a very long list of bad shows they&#039;ve produced as well.<br />
<br />
This is one of those bad ones.<br />
<br />
I walked into this one having read the first two volumes of the manga and knowing fully that there was only a 50/50 chance of this series being any good. Unfortunately, my gamble didn&#039;t pay off. The first thing that bothers me is the fanservice. Yes, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23694">
        manga also has copious amounts of it, but it takes a backseat to the plot. Here in the anime, the reverse is true. The show reverts to a cliched monster-of-the-week formula with no real tension in any of the situations because you know exactly how it will be resolved by the end of the episode. There are no over-arcing storylines and absolutely no character development.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a shame, because there&#039;s a lot of potential here, with the setting they chose, putting a human in a school for monsters and all, but any clever setups we could have had are completely blown in favor of even more fanservice. The only consistent plot element is the insufferable on-again, off-again relationship between the two man characters, Tsukune and Moka, but even then, their arguments and troubles are not interesting, not sympathetic, and not really grounded in any sort of reality that would make us care for what&#039;s going on.<br />
<br />
Speaking of characters, that&#039;s also a place where the series falls flat on its ass. Moka and Tsukune are the only ones who have any real depth to them, and that&#039;s really only because of Moka&#039;s split personality, and their strained relationship. The rest of the characters, while having a few funny moments, only exist to create a little more conflict and to fill in the stereotypical rolls of a Harem anime: Kurumu&#039;s a bitch, Yukina&#039;s a loli, and Mizori&#039;s a quiet stalker. There, you know everything about them you&#039;ll ever need to know. Other characters, like Nekonome-sensei are actually far more fun to see, but they&#039;re only ever on screen for a small amount of time in each episode, if they&#039;re even featured at all. Oh, and since the villain changes every episode as well, don&#039;t expect any deep characterization for them either. They&#039;re all either perverts who want to get into one of the main characters&#039; pants (by force if necessary) or want to prove their strength by maiming one of the heroes. There is one exception to this rule, but to avoid spoilers, I can&#039;t talk about her, and again, she only appears in like, two episodes before conforming to another stereotype.<br />
<br />
Moving on to a different topic, the sound in this anime is probably the only really good part of this. The voice actors bring a lot of energy to their rolls, and it&#039;s competent enough, though a few of the characters do cross the annoyance line one too many times for my taste. The sound effects are also decent, if a little stock, though the one you&#039;ll probably hear the most often is the strange bouncing sound effect that happens whenever a female&#039;s breasts bounce. Yes, bouncing breasts have their own sound effect in this show. The music is also good, if a bit stock, and it has a good mixing of classical string scores and horn concertos, but there isn&#039;t a whole lot of variety.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation, well... it&#039;s Gonzo working on a school harem anime. The character designs are actually really well done and all of them do look very faithful to their original manga designs, though I do think a few of the coloring options for some of them was a tad strange... Kurumu having blue hair just doesn&#039;t seem right to me and Mizore&#039;s black and purple outfit and hair make me think she&#039;s going to turn into the Cheshire Cat at any moment. However, the designs are consistently good, but the animation itself is... well, Gonzo. Still frames abound, folks. Close-ups even moreso. Scenes of people running look a little choppy. You&#039;re getting the idea, I hope. The only parts that seem to be above this quality are during the fight scenes that take place in each episode, but these fights are so short (most of them end with a single blow, folks) that it&#039;s barely noticeable. The only other place that seems to have a budget on this show is the giggle physics. Seriously, an female who has breasts large enough to be noticeable, you will see jiggles and jumps all over the place that looks more fluent than the animation of the actual character.<br />
<br />
Like I&#039;ve said, I&#039;ve only read the first two (out of a total of six) volumes of the manga, but even then, I still feel like I know more about the characters, their motivations, their thoughts, and their personalities than after watching all thirteen episodes of this series. The characters aren&#039;t interesting and at best only serve to further the plot while at worst just exist for more fanservice, the plot is nonexistent and the characters (if you haven&#039;t figured out by now) aren&#039;t strong enough to drive the story forward, and while the main focus would appear to be on Moka and Tsukune&#039;s relationship, absolutely nothing changes or gets resolved at all by the end of the series!<br />
<br />
Bottom line, if you&#039;re really interested, skip the anime, skip the second season (capu 2) and just pick up the manga instead! trust me, you&#039;ll be glad you did... but hey, I do have one good thing to say about this: at no point during the series do any of the vampires sparkle!

    Rosario+Vampire Review:<br />
<br />
Rosario+Vampire was one of the first anime I ever watched. Due to this, I hold this show very close to my heart and may have a positively biased opinion so excuse me if it shows through. However, after revisiting the show and re-evaluating how good it actually is, I have to say that this show is perfectly &quot;meh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Story - 4.5/10:<br />
One thing that I have noticed MANY people complain about with this anime, is that it basically disgraces the manga. Both the anime and the manga have the same introductory premise of a high school boy named Tsukune accidentally being enrolled in a school for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125907">
        monsters. During his time here, he develops his own harem consisting of various sexy monster babes with different personalities. However, while the manga grows from this premise and turns into an action packed, exciting ride, the anime decides to settle in this groove and remain a standard high school harem with a monster twist. Now, I am not saying this is a bad thing, but from a story perspective, yes, this means the anime is not as good as the manga. However, the anime does succeed in creating some funny moments, and somewhat unique plotlines due to its unique concept. It by no means has any emotional depth, riveting action, or psychological themes. However, the story in Rosario+Vampire is not &quot;bad&quot;, it is merely just your average harem storyline with a monster twist.<br />
<br />
Art - 5.4/10:<br />
When I first saw this show I thought the animation was fantastic.... Oh how wrong I was. The main reason I thought the art was good, is because my prior anime experiences were with the likes of Girls Bravo, Pokemon, and DBZ, however, after watching more anime I have concluded that the art for this show is 100% average. The character designs were good at times, especially when we got to see the students change into monster form, however, for many reasons, this show does not stand out art-wise. First off, there is basically only one location, the school. Add in the fact that there are plenty of still frames and you can easily notice that not a lot of budget was needed for this show. There was also no eye-catching lighting or color schemes to go with it. The art wasn&#039;t poor, but not much better than average.<br />
<br />
Sound - 6.5/10:<br />
Here&#039;s where my nostalgia factor for this show might bring some bias. I really liked the music for this show. More specifically, I really liked the openings to this show. This remains true to this day and will likely not change. However, the voice acting could be cringe worthy at times and was extremely up and down for me. Add in the poor script and listening to those english voice actors could be painful. But none the less, the soundtrack was enjoyable for me and by no means was the voice acting &quot;bad&quot;, just not good.<br />
<br />
Characters - 5.2/10:<br />
I really wanna give this section a higher score but I know I can&#039;t. The manga has made me fall in love with the characters, but when i look back at the anime and how it portrayed the characters.... ehhh. I watched the anime first, and was pretty up and down about the characters, and now that I know more about the standard character archetypes, I am even more meh about the characters. Tsukune is the standard wimpy lead for a harem, and the girls are all typical archetypes (the caring one, the tomboy, the shy one, the loli). Even though the characters were all standard, they were likeable for the most part and for this reason I consider them slightly above average.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 6.5/10:<br />
Like I said: This was one of my first anime. For that reason, I really enjoyed this show when I first watched it. If I hadn&#039;t gotten to this show until let&#039;s say a week ago, I probably would drop it. But due to the fact that I watched it so early, I did really enjoy it. It was funny, the characters were likeable, and occasionally they will include some interesting fight scenes. The scenarios that the characters found themselves in tended to be interesting and definitely kept me enjoying the show.<br />
<br />
Overall - 5.62:<br />
It might be a lot different than the manga, but Rosario+Vampire&#039;s anime adaptation holds its own. It isn&#039;t really overwhelmingly impressive in any area, but it definitely does what it has to do in order to be an above average harem. I recommend watching the anime before reading the manga to prevent disappointment, because (especially for fans of harem anime) the anime is worth a shot. If you enjoy harem romcoms, definitely watch this show. However, if you are just looking for a new show to watch, don&#039;t expect too much from this show because it really is barely above average.<br />
<br />
The Verdict:<br />
An average high school harem with a monster twist.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
+ OPs are catchy<br />
+ Solid comedy<br />
+ Good concept<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- Plot has no direction<br />
- Manga fans will be disapointed<br />
- English dub is inconsistent<br />
<br />
If you liked Rosario Vampire, watch...<br />
Girls Bravo:<br />
If you liked the over the top adult humor that focused mainly on oversexual jokes and enjoy watching harems, this show is right for you.<br />
Sekirei:<br />
If you liked the harem idea (and boobs), but were more interested in the action than the comedy, Sekirei is for you.<br />
<br />
5.62 - Alright

    I first read the manga to rosario+vampire. It was a wonderful to read threw it all. so when I heard it was a anime too, I hough I have to watch this....<br />
Story:what the heck happen to 40% of the story plot? they either drag out esp. or skip entire story plot lines. these plot lines where imporant to! Like the art teacher. she was in the beging and the end too! how do you skip that? On the witches hill made my head hurt.that was also change at points that made no sense. the last of this horror story was the end. they tried to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17855">
        &quot;stay with the manga&quot; but failed! I mean if you cut out plot points it will make no sense , to bother. they wrap it up so badly if you try to think how does this make any sense at the school and what they heard about aono just does not make any sense.<br />
art: was great! this is how anime should be done! the back grounds to the characters.<br />
sound: was ok. at some points it grinded on my nerves ( like ever time there was a romic sense). but the songs in it was good.<br />
characters: sigh.......I  love them in the manga but in the anime was bad! everyone seem to try way to hard to get aono&#039;s love. the manga was not like that. missing some ( art teacher) and chainging others badliy (Ginie).<br />
enjoyment:<br />
was only had in the few esp. they did right. which was not a lot. why did they have so many panty shot&#039;s? I like fan service as much as the next guy but that was too much.<br />
overall:<br />
I only watch because of the manga. i know somtimes you need to cut some things out from the manga. but with 13 esp could they have spend the time  to make it 26 esp and did it right?

    I am rather disappointed with this series.  I&#039;ve seen 2 episodes and I&#039;ve noticed a recurring theme: FANSERVICE.  This really irritates me.  In my opinion it really pulls away from where the focus needs to be (which is on the characters).  This series has a great deal of potential.  However, with the overwhelming focus on T&amp;amp;A shots, There&#039;s no way for me to enjoy this.

    Let me start off by saying that the I love the manga Rosario + Vampire, written by Akihisa Ikeda; it is an amazing story that has high re-read value and plenty of entertainment. It is an unquestionable 10/10 for me.<br />
<br />
Rosario + Vampire, the anime adaption, on the other hand is complete garbage and remains one of the biggest fuck ups in the history of anime. <br />
<br />
The anime version of Rosario + Vampire takes out everything good that was in the manga (the story, meaningful character relationships) and replaces it with fan service.<br />
<br />
Gonzo basically took one of the best mangas and COMPLETELY ruined it with fan

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28640">
        service. A little bit of fan service is okay once in a while (I don&#039;t like it though), but Rosario + Vampire bases its entire show on fan service. Gonzo basically exploited a masterpiece and turned it into trash to earn a couple bucks.<br />
<br />
Lets talk about Tsukune Aono. In the manga, Tsukune is a three diminsional character who gradually learns how to adapt to a dangerous school full of monster. I&#039;m not going to say how, cause that will spoil the story. But in the anime, Tsukune is a stereotypical loser who somehow gets a harem of the hottest girls in school - I HATE this cliche. Why are all the characters so stereotypical and one dimensional?<br />
<br />
There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this anime adaption of Rosario + Vampire. <br />
<br />
This anime needs to be remade correctly!!<br />
<br />

    There is dumb fun, and then there is just plain asinine. Rosario + Vampire tries hard to convince us that it is the former, it tries very hard. The show is openly aware of how stupid it can get, and happily points out how dumb it is being as its main source of comedy. Unfortunately, this is not only a flimsy source of comedy that only occasionally works, it also makes it irritatingly evident that the plotting is shoddy and the characters are one-dimensional and poorly developed; plus that the show was made to blatantly exhibition girls&#039; cleavage. This results in a fan-service comedy that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review86575">
        is more obnoxious than it ever is funny.<br />
<br />
The poor idiot in the middle of this mess is Tsukune, a human who ends up going to a school for monsters through ridiculous circumstances; namely being sent there by his parents that know nothing about the school (well, aren&#039;t they responsible) after he failed the high school entrance exam. Luckily for him, Yokai Academy is a school which is meant to teach monsters to co-exist with humans; all students are required to take human form and stay that way. Here he meets the obvious main love interest, a vampire named Moka. Moka is a nice girl with a bad habit of drinking Tsukune&#039;s blood, and has a separate personality that emerges when the rosary on her neck is removed. He also meets other girls that eventually try gaining his love, like the big boobed succubus girl, and the loli witch gir... you know what, none of this really matters. It is basically the same set up as any harem anime, with a bunch of extraneous details that either don&#039;t add much to the story, or are used to incredibly stupid effect.<br />
<br />
Most of the show has a monster-of-the-week format, with silly school yard shenanigans and fan-service thrown in, of course. Most episodes go like this: Tsukune attends class and hangs out with Moka and other members of his growing harem; one of the monsters attending the school starts causing troubles for their group; when a confrontation finally flairs up, Tsukune removes Moka&#039;s rosary and she kicks the monster&#039;s ass; rinse and repeat. Needless to say, this formula gets boring quickly, but the show keeps at it with about three-fourths of the episodes more or less going like this.<br />
<br />
The show also implements every trite trope found in any anime with a school setting, like the harem of friendly love-rivals, the pool and beach episodes, and so on. This is something that the show is fully aware of. There is this token animal mascot talking bat that appears often, and spouts wise-cracks about the characters&#039; ridiculous behavior, how cliche a certain event is, or just says something during scene changes. This bat has to be one of the most annoying and obnoxious of mascot characters; he isn&#039;t the least bit funny because he comments on the most pointless of things, and he never says anything that is remotely witty. It is obvious what the show was going for with this, but it just completely fails. All it really does is make more apparent how poor the writing in the show is, and that the writers are aware how bad it is; this comes across as if they just didn&#039;t care.<br />
<br />
As lackluster as the comedy is, the show&#039;s attempt drama in the show is even worse. Most of the show&#039;s dramatics revolve around things getting in the way of Tskune and Moka&#039;s developing relationship... if it can even be called that. All there is between them is Tskune fawning over how pretty and nice Moka is, and Moka drinks his blood as if he was a drinking fountain but still wanting to be his friend/ love interest. There really isn&#039;t any depth or dynamic between the two even the show tries to convince us there is. Any other attempt at drama similarly fails because the characters are barely developed to be anymore than trite stereotypes found in this kind of show, so it is hard to care about any of them. Even the stuff about Yokai Academy being a school which teaches monsters to fit into human society goes out the window when Tskune is revealed to be a human, sending the entire student body to form a mob calling for his blood, while the faculty deciding to do nothing for no other reason than to make things needlessly dramatic.<br />
<br />
On the technical side of things, Rosario + Vampire is the definition of laziness. It isn&#039;t that it is terrible, it is just so damn generic looking. Girls with boobs that rival watermelons, flat chested lolis, really dumb looking hooligans, squirmy nerd losers, and a rainbow assortment of hair colors; every stereotype associated with anime character designs can be found in this show. The backgrounds are similarly bland, although admittedly the haunted looking woods surrounding the school are done pretty well. There are a lot of short cuts taken in the animation, in fact almost everything that is animated is a short cut. The use of music is unremarkable as is the soundtrack itself; mostly filled with bubbly pop compositions that accentuate silly moments, or slightly more aggressive compositions during tenser moments, so it is fitting but nothing sticks long after the scene passes.<br />
<br />
To sum things up, don&#039;t watch Rosario + Vampire. It is a show that encapsulates almost everything bad about modern anime. Characters are plastic stereotypes; Tsukune is a thoroughly uninteresting male lead, and all the girls are little more than walking fan-service. Ecchi anime are usually dumb fun best not taken seriously, but that is hardly an excuse for a show to be so poorly written and so lazily executed. What&#039;s worse is that the show actually takes a stab at drama that is so hackney that it drags the show even lower than the decidedly low standards it set for itself. It doesn&#039;t even qualify as dumb fun, it is just embarrassing.<br />

         With one episode this series is off to a some what fast but descent start.  Good points, very nice looking characters and well animated series.  The girls are cute and you get to see their panties.  Down side, you get to see there panties in every shot.  I&#039;m all for panty shots but there&#039;s a point where it gets old... :P  The plot is pretty weak but then again it&#039;s hard to judge because there has only been one episode.  I&#039;m definitely going to keep watching and I won&#039;t discourage anyone from trying the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1885">
        series out with me.  It strikes me as a somewhat light hearted series which is always welcome.<br />
     You do get descent back ground info on the characters in the first episode with is a huge plus.  Along time ago I found you have to watch the first 3 episodes of any series to really judge much about it because there is usually very little info/ character building in the first episode.

    I don’t even know where to begin to talk about this mess of an anime. Why this is such a popular anime is completely mind boggling to me. Is it because it’s trash? Is it because it’s just so much of a mess, it’s completely confusing everyone?<br />
Essentially, this is a story revolving around a gary stu. The main character is less than mediocre, and as to why an apparently amazing vampire is in love with his ugly perverted, absolutely useless self is absolutely beyond me.<br />
The other main character is of course a mary sue. She is loved by all, immensely powerful, confident, etc. As to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194837">
        why a supposedly “beautiful” and “wonderful” character would somehow hang around some sack of shit that isn’t even supposed to go to that school is bizarre. And this little girl witch is supposed to make him fall in love with her too? (Okay, are we even going to address how that little girl is catering to the literal pedophiles of the audience? She’s supposed to be seen as this innocent little girl that he’s going to love. What the fuck? Get that loli stuff out of my face. Not to mention, they body shame her for having the smallest breasts in the show. WHY ARE YOU SEXUAIZING A LITTLE GIRL?)<br />
Why are people involved with him? He is not even remotely attractive in any way possible. I could see how a vampire would be attracted, as she needs blood. (The way she bites him is very annoying and cutesy, by the way.) Why is he the main character when a toothpick would be more relevant to the plot? Why does this anime exist?<br />
The art is mediocre. It’s your typical anime series type of art, and every once in a while you’ll see the style improve. (Of course, it’s when the mary sue gets all powerful..) Also I would like to understand why on Earth it was necessary to ever add in a panty shot. Did we really need to see this? Is that necessary? Did seeing her “oh so sexy” underwear further the plot? Did it help the audience really understand the struggles these characters go through? Not at all. These are high school girls. They aren’t adults. Save the ecchi for a show with older characters.<br />
The logic in this series is an absolute mess, and it goes against the very (weak) fabric of the meaning of these characters. The main girl character is this amazing and all powerful vampire that can only really be that powerful once in a while? Okay, bye. Where are her REAL weaknesses? I’d love to know, and I’m sure the rest of the audience would like to as well.<br />
Furthermore, a succubus that attacked the gary stu once and then realized she was “in love” and wanted to “manually make him fall in love with her”? What the hell is this? The job of a succubus is to use men for sex, not to be romantically attracted to them. Even her mom points this out and she decides to ignore the obvious.<br />
ALSO the gary stu sometimes looks at other girls, unsurprisingly. And the mary sue gets upset EVEN THOUGH his crush on her is extremely obvious and she isn’t requiting it? There is literally no reason for you to be jealous, you two aren’t dating. There was no communication of this at all.<br />
Every second of this anime made me suffer, every “kyu~” and “mochaaaa!” made my ears bleed. Whoever edited this anime has my respect, I can barely watch this sack of shit once, god forbid several times. Don’t watch this anime, for the love of god. I don’t care if you want to watch it ironically or for a joke. Not even then would this anime be enjoyable. Don’t waste your time. Take up literally almost anything but this trash. Love yourself.

    It&#039;s a good concept. Although it&#039;s been done many times, the quirky characters and their personality grow on you. Having read all the way to chapter 33 of the manga I can say this for sure; the story is changed in a way that removes the depth of the characters and situations. The real problem is the Fan service, there is far too much. This anime had so much potential in the first few episodes, then the excess of fan service obliterated the depth of the story.<br />
<br />
From an artistic perspective the animation is of very good quality, the backgrounds are drawn very well and it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3060">
        is a pleasure to watch. If you love fan service than his anime will not disappoint you in that respect.<br />
<br />
The sound is great. The opening and ending themes also performed by Nana Mizuki are nice to get you into the watching mood. The songs during the episodes become quite annoying at times; however, the voice actors are very well suited to the personality of their characters, Nana Mizuki&#039;s performance as Moka is very good, and one of the best followed closely by Kugimiya, Rie as Shirayuki.<br />
<br />
The characters much like the story suffer the transition from manga to anime, however, the voice cast manages to make up for the shortcomings and bring the characters to life and make it fun to watch. <br />
<br />
If you love supernatural, fan service, cute girls, good voice acting and a pretty decent story, watch this anime.<br />
(However)<br />
If you love supernatural, fan-service, cute girls, a very good story, and romance, read the manga.<br />
<br />
This anime is good, it really is! I just happen to like substance over Fan service, as such; I will have to say that the manga is better than the anime.<br />

    Story - 6/10 (D): An average high schooler gets somehow transferred to a school full of Vampires who wear ridiculously short skirts.<br />
<br />
Uh-huh, real inspiring plot, all right. This show should just be labeled as Yuri or Hentai. Those two categories have absolutely zero plot. Yet i gave it a six because it tried to make something out of it, i&#039;ll give it that. I can stomach the first few episodes, after that it&#039;s fanservice and more fanservice.<br />
<br />
Art - 8/10 (B)<br />
Well, for a really lame show, it still looks pretty, right? <br />
<br />
Sound - 7/10 (C-)<br />
I&#039;ll admit it, i&#039;m hooked on Nana Mizuki&#039;s singing, including &amp;quot;Discotheque&amp;quot; for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10558">
        the second season. Forgive me.<br />
<br />
Character - 6/10 (D)<br />
This show has everything a school themed show should have: The perverted girls trying to flirt with the protagonist every episode in at least one scene, the male protagonist who can&#039;t turn away from yuri for 5 seconds, and the occasional geek or added-in character.  Rosario + Vampire brings all those kinds of characters we &amp;quot;love&amp;quot;.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall: 6/10 (D)<br />
Honestly, a show such as Rosario + Vampire gives anime a bad name for being called porn and slutty. Bible Black has more of a plot than this (Bible Black is a hentai, by the way.) Heck, even NARUTO has a better plot. But it can somewhat repair with the talent singing of the dual voice acting/singing talents of the Rosario cast. Each episode has professional-grade animation other shows should use. For a plot-less show, the Art is top notch.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Good: Animation, BGM.<br />
<br />
The Bad: Plot, character depth, basically everything.

    Having officially read the Manga a couple of days ago I pondered why I originally gave this show a 9 in the past when in all honesty it is incomparable to the manga in terms of plot, character and wait for it ~ external character design.<br />
<br />
But nevertheless both the show and manga succeeded in their own intended ways, both were done good so to say. Removing the manga out of this discussion for the sake of the review  Rosario Vampire is a episodic series following a simple plot:<br />
<br />
Mediocre guy who couldn&#039;t pass his HS entrance exams with no special talents gets admitted and sent

          <span style="display: none;" id="review124801">
        accidently to a a private school called Yolki academy ~ which plot twist is an academy that trains monsters to cope with blending in with the human realm. He meets a vampire named Moka. In the context of the series vampires are &#039;S Class&#039; monsters or top tier monsters in battle. She protects and helps him develop his inner personality as they together study at the school throughout the plot. A harem is developed and mini adventures are made ect.. But each episode adds an element to the plot that is revealed as a arc in the end of this series. So there&#039;s no existential angst involved.<br />
<br />
Story : 2/10<br />
<br />
Its episodic and follows the same syntax:<br />
<br />
while(more episodes) {<br />
<br />
if (fow) == male {<br />
 bringin (Moka);<br />
fow = null;<br />
<br />
else if (fow == female){<br />
 bringin (Moka);<br />
fow.savedbyProtagonist;<br />
harem++;<br />
 }<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Art/Animation : 8/10<br />
<br />
Shueisha did a good job at animating the characters and monsters invovled. There was alot of imagination involved in the show and although not spectacular it did a good job in portraying the characters emotions and scenery.<br />
<br />
Character  4/10 (Character Design 8/10)<br />
<br />
Typical harem characters. A mediocre guy with a good heart, a shy introverted sub-protagonist. But each of the girls is a monster with special abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Fan Service 10/10<br />
<br />
RV is the opiate of fan-service. The type of &#039;soul food&#039; you need when watching anime. Let me elaborate. In the past I witnessed countless anime that were centred around similar plot styles. However the way they included fan service involve naked girls or devices/monsters that tore clothing (sigh).  <br />
I like to call it forced fan service. With the exception of miniskirts Rosario Vampire added an element of &#039;Inner Moko&#039; which I wont spoil but added a excellent type of treat for the fans that made them claw for her to show and develop herself more. I wont spoil it but youll see how this anime is separated from the usual harem.<br />
<br />
Overall Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
<br />
if (intelligence &lt; ....)<br />
<br />
No Im joking. <br />
<br />
I enjoyed it and watched the series within a day. <br />
<br />
 <br />

    You would probably like this anime if you like comedy and real quick fighting scenes that last about 80 seconds long (most of the time) as long as you get over the fan service scenes.<br />
I gave the story a 10 because its original and its very interesting how Tsukune Aono and Moka Akashiya trys to hide the fact that Tsukune is a human from Tsukune&#039;s other friends who have a crush on him.The plot is very well also.<br />
I gave art/animation a 5 because the series have too much fan service in most of the episodes. But luckily, a few of the episodes don&#039;t have much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3487">
        of it (most of the fan service scenes are at the beginning of the series). Also the anime have some good fight scenes that you can see in almost every episode and the fighting scenes are really short unlike other shows.<br />
I gave sound a 9, because the sound was well and there was no pitch problems.<br />
I gave the characters an 8 because the characters are original, but you either have to like or hate the characters. Plus I really love the character Nazo Koumori who&#039;s a bat that provides useless information most of the time.<br />
Overall, I&#039;ve really enjoyed the series so I gave both a 10. I really liked this anime because of the comedy, fight scenes, and the romance in it. This is one of my favorites anime and I really hope they make a second season. I didn&#039;t really focused on the fanservice scenes and if you are going to watch this anime, don&#039;t focus on the fanservice or you might hate the series and give up on it before you have a chance to like it. So, if you are going to watch this anime, watch it to the very end.<br />

    Wait Guys before before being a troll and hitting the &#039;Not Helpful&#039; give it a chance.<br />
<br />
This is AMAZING............... until was adapted into an Anime :/<br />
What fans hate the most is when they turn their favourite amazing mindblowing series to just a good anime to watch in your free time.<br />
I watched the anime first then read the manga, I ended up crawling into a ball and asked myself<br />
<br />
&#039;Do adaptions like screwing you over?&#039;<br />
<br />
I came up with the simple answer &#039;YES&#039;<br />
<br />
There are 2 people who do not enjoy this show they are:<br />
1. Douchebags that watch ecchi and then bitch about fanservice<br />
2. The Manga Readers (fair enough I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review58229">
        feel for you guys)<br />
<br />
To the people who haven&#039;t read the manga, watch it its a great romcom that will make you laugh until your onto the second season.<br />
<br />
To the people who have read the manga and not seen the show, you most probably wont enjoy it to the adaption is a kick in the dick for all readers. But it is still enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Okay now onto the review<br />
<br />
The basic plot is about the main character Tsukune ends up accidently in a school only for monsters. Where he meets Moka a vampire, who becomes really powerful when her rosario seal is removed and an inner personality is revealed. Tsukune faces many troubles but is able to build up a harem over the season etc.<br />
<br />
Art is quite good nothing amazing but still effective for creating a good show. The music and the sound were also effective and a strong point towards the series.<br />
<br />
Characters- a reasonable amout of character development is good with the usual harem stereotypes.<br />
<br />
Though reading the manga i still enjoy this show and its a good couple of hours that you wont miss. Finishing it with you stomach sore from laughter.<br />
<br />
As an anime it is a good show that people should at least try.<br />
<br />
I hope its helpful! Cheers and have a good one!<br />
<br />

    A vapid, shallow exercise in brand promotion that offers little in the way of humor, or even titillation. <br />
Yes, RtV, please regale me more about this unlikeable loser who somehow has multiple attractive girls fawning over him. And make sure to keep them chaste, it would be such a SHAME if this wish-fulfillment centered premise actually fulfilled anyone&#039;s wishes. Or made jokes that were funny. Or had characters that were likable instead of half-assed archetypes. The characters have no sort of synergy or chemistry with one another, only existing to pad out each episode&#039;s runtime with tired, predictable hijinks that elicit more groans than laughs.

        Lead &quot;love interest&quot; Moka&#039;s interactions with Tsukune are so stilted and unbelievable you&#039;d think the guy who wrote them was raised by robots who spoke like Microsoft Sam. <br />
 Really, any sort of effort put into the story or characters world could have made it at least passable. As it stands, it&#039;s a tired, cynical attempt to cash in on teenagers who like staring at objectified girls fawn over someone they can project themselves onto.<br />
One cringeworthy entry in the harem subgenre to stand with all the others.

    I put Rosario Vampire on my list of anime that are simply so terrible that you can&#039;t stop watching them.  A simple, average, puny, wimpy boy, played by Shinji Ikari, surrounded by gorgeous teen and preteen girls who all for some reason or another desperately want him in the pants.  This theme has been done before and done to death, and the overabundance of panty shots (second in number only to Najica Blitz Tactics) just further pigeonholes this anime into the mediocre ecchi territory held by Steel Angel Kurumi and Ai Yori Aoshi.  <br />
<br />
So what sets Rosario Vampire apart?  I can&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5965">
        in good conscience see anyone as taking this anime seriously.  Every character, episode, and scene is done so ridiculously over-the-top and bizarrely cliched that it&#039;s really impossible to accept Rosario Vampire as anything but a joke.  It does for harem anime what Nadesico did for teen pilot mecha anime.  Stunningly beautiful art and animation (even if what is depicted typically consists of booties, boobies, and panties) only serves to enhance the eye candy that this series strives to be.<br />
<br />
If you have the ability to embrace the cheesy, ignore trite and overtroped plotlines and characterizations, and crack up head over heels laughing at the joke this series is, then Rosario Vampire is the show for you.
