    For some reason 22/7 has little to no negative reviews even with this relatively low MAL score so I thought I would take it upon myself to justify why it is the way it is.<br />
<br />
For one, 22/7 has a ridiculous premise. I will spoil it right here, so here we go: The reason why all 8 girls were summoned to become an idol group was because a giant Wall (yes, WALL) that an entire secret facility was build around on spit out a golden plate that said so. <br />
I want to inform anyone that might not know this, but 22/7 is a real idol group.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333515">
        Which decided to make a promo anime. With a magic fantasy wall that spit out the absolute order that these girls are the key to form the ideal idol group. If this isn’t a promo that shows you are a little too full of yourself, I don’t know what is.<br />
<br />
The wall’s orders are all absolute, truthful and all just work successfully every time. Meaning this series has no stakes. No stakes they might fail or any other emotional stakes because the series doesn’t bother to invest into any other element of a story.<br />
<br />
The entire show is the characters doing some idol shit, implying they are struggling, instead grotesquely succeeding because the WALL is just the baddest boss ever and giving every single member an artificially emotional and dramatic backstory for the viewers to feel for them. Because this is how we write anime.<br />
<br />
I don’t actually know if every member of this idol group has these backstories in real life, but I honestly doubt it by how anime and predictable they were. <br />
<br />
<br />
Aspects I liked about the show were the strong production values. Having Yukiko Horiguchi as character designer on your team as well as a director or episode directors that bump out several great layouts is in your favor. Though since this is not Kyoto Animation, most of the effort put into the animation falls relatively flat because this studio isn’t all too well equipped to draw the taxing character designs of Yukiko as well as the script not being tight enough to actually justify any of the creative decisions. I wouldn’t say much is off-model but some scenes look more cleaner and better polished up than others. All the characters are but only pretty character designs of specific-archetype-number X with fake emotional backstories to back them up, that are so artificially crafted most people couldn’t fall for it if they tried. Though the reviews and almost 7.0 average score are telling me that it worked for some folks for sure.<br />
I would be lying in denying that I didn’t enjoy the emotional core of episode 7, which not only striked me with its incredible storyboard layouts and fairly good plot, but I cannot say so for everything else in the show. All backstories, even the one I somewhat enjoyed, were just raw templates ripped out of the book “How to create a mediocre anime” and make no actual sense in context of the interal logic of the series. I will tell you a secret: Giving every character in your show a backstory isn’t going to make them get fleshed out or feel more authentic, especially when all the backstories are badly written and dishonest in their emotional core. The show is of one cour length, you could’ve made a competent idol anime out of what talent they already had on board by having a competent script writer just write idols be idols and fleshing them out with having to handle the struggles of the work and in their interactions with their group, but all of these aspects fall short because half of every episode has to be backstory time.<br />
<br />
And if that wasn’t the worst aspect: I don’t think some members can sing. Some sound completely tone-deaf and to that are terrible voice actors, some are a little more authentic. Overall making the idol group voice act their “character” was not a smart idea, as they mostly sound bad. Especially the performances are underwhelming. The melodies are generic and forgettable and the lyrics are self-important and pretentious. Especially the debute song is a pack off ass. Singing about “Life is so hard” – urgh, just makes me sick.<br />
<br />
<br />
So overall what makes 22/7 not great is the badly written script, artificial and bland characters but having a generally great production even if the team cannot handle it like a KyoAni would. But what made it really bad was the finale. The finale just flat out made the anime say to the viewers that they don’t care in explaining the Wall at all. The last episode was actually hilarious, I recommend watching that one at least.<br />
<br />
This anime didn’t give a fuck. For sure some of the production team did, because I consider it a good production, but the actual product is an empty husk and creatively bankrupt piece of “art” that serves exactly one point – promo for an idol group. <br />
They didn’t care to write an authentic, genuine and emotional script, they just wrote some “anime bullshit” premise and then threw in emotional backstories to sway any uneducated viewer easily. <br />
Also let the characters grow to love being an idol seemingly off-screen and make them all emotionally invested in the job right before the last order of the wall is delivered towards the end of the show, then let the plot commence and leave the show end with a “bang” – all to promote an idol group. One of the harshest industries there are. And they glorify this work in this anime as well. <br />
<br />
22/7 sucked and was among the most banal and shameless promos I have seen, while wasting some great animation talent in the same process. Truly shameful.<br />
<br />

Overview <br />
<br />
<br />

Art &amp; Animation: 7/10 – Really good with great layouts. Not on a KyoAni level, though it felt like they tried with having Yukiko on the team<br />
Sound: 4/10 – Terrible voice acting and pretentious and artificially emotional lyrics, falls in theme with the show. It did have a decent OST and sounddesign though.<br />
Character: 2/10 – Nothing humane.<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10 – I did have a good time even if some of it was laughing by how dumb it was<br />
Idol: 3/10 – It speaks for itself<br />

    An anime adaptation of 22/7 adds another title to the seasonal idol lineup we get every year. Usually, we get at least 1-2 idol theme anime per season but 22/7 is also known for being a real life idol group. And make no mistake, becoming a member of the 22/7 idol group is no easy task. Because out of over 10,000 candidates, only a few are selected as being worthy. On a few are born to be an idol. Only a few has what it takes to be a member of 22/7.<br />
<br />
Idol shows are known for their promotional material and a testament of having characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333231">
        as role models. The members have strict life styles and in Japanese culture, they must abide to rules or be eliminated. Because of this, becoming part of an idol group is a celebrated feat, an accomplishment that one should be proud of. 22/7 consists of 8 characters, all with different personalities, backgrounds, and ambitions. However, they are united under the same banner, to be idols and entertain the world through music. <br />
<br />
The idol culture graces us with facts that in the entertainment world, anything can happen. Being high school students, they’re still learning to grow up and taking steps into adolescence is no easy task. The first few episodes promises to set up a storytelling saga to showcase the reality of idol life. Being managed by “The Wall”, the show is unique in that it’s not managed by a talent agency. From the first episode, we are introduced to Miu Takuigawa, an ordinary high school teenager looking for work. After having trouble earning income for her family, she decides to become a member but interestingly enough, Miu is one of the less qualified members compared to the other cast. More interestingly, Miu is initially chosen as the lead center and with that comes a huge responsibility. It doesn’t take long for her to clash with fellow idol member Nicole in the second episode. And this shouldn’t be a surprise either as the audience should easily be able to see that Nicole qualifies more as a leader than Miu. The first two episodes brings together the melodrama and reality of being in an idol group. Even within the group, they have problems so what’s to say they won’t face even bigger problems?<br />
<br />
Luckily, differences can be put aside as by the time we reach the third episode, 22/7 is in line to perform their first live concert. It doesn’t go well at first due to equipment failure but as the leader, Miu takes charge for herself and manages to save them from humiliation. In essence, her actions earns the respect of the group and the audience. And because of her committment, it’s safe to say that Miu earned her spot. But this show isn’t just about Miu. Viewers should remember that there are 7 other girls and each of them come from different backgrounds. From episode 4 and onwards, we are given insights about some of their personalities and background stories on a personal level for the remaining cast. This form of storytelling is also important as it showcase the realism of the show. There’s obvious social problems that the idols deal with including social anxiety, loneliness, self-doubt, and even the deaths of a loved one. If we look at the bigger picture, this show seems to aim to be an emotional drama than the lighthearted pop culture such as Idolmaster or Love Live. Some of my favorite episodes in this season exists because it gets you emotionally invested into the cast such as Akane, Toda, and even Ayaka. Other times, the anime aims to collectively tell stories about the group as a whole to the world. In one of the later episodes, it tests the emotional connection of the group as they become attached together like a family. The more you watch 22/7, the more you realize it’s more than just a group of idols existing together to perform on stage. It’s about living a life to fulfill dreams and overcoming life obstacles that didn’t seem possible.<br />
<br />
From the theatrical performances to the character designs, A-1 Pictures adapted this anime like a play. The characters are the actors, or idols in this case, but always portrayed as realistic as possible. They are humans after all and even transcending into the idol realm doesn’t immortalize them as Gods. But as 22/7 grows more in popularity, you can see how the group improves themselves with better dance coordination, singing tunes, and even their stage outfits. On the technical level, the animated music videos themselves uses CGI with some 3D choreography. Now, before you throw the towel, I do want to say this show managed to animate itself rather well. The dance movements look sharp and chereography has coordination while not being overly reliant on the animation itself. It may take time to get used to but as it stands, 22/7’s CGI works wonders. <br />
<br />
Now, the big question remains. How should the music be judged? As “idols who cross dimensions”, the seiyu in this show had to undergo through lengthy process of being selected so rest assured that the music you hear is top tier quality. It relies a lot on conveying emotions and communicating the idols’ emotions to the audience. Sony Music Records bought top tier talent together to compose their discography. The most noticeable one is perhaps the OP theme song, “MuzuI” performed by Uta Kawase. Also distinguishable is the fact that almost every episode contains a different ED theme, most often featuring the prominent character related to that episode. Insert songs are also occasionally used in episodes during climatic moments.<br />
<br />
There’s a good chance people missed out on this show this year. It’s a niche anime targeted to the music demographic but from what’s shown, 22/7 itself went above expectations to be more than just idols performing on stage. The amount of melancholy is above the general consensus and in retrospect, it reinvents itself as a music drama. Spread the word and let it be known that 22/7 is a rewarding experience.

    22/7... That is the title of the anime...sounds like a mathematical thing. However, what is behind this mysterious number? This numerical value certainly seems familiar to one or the other in relation to π (Pi), but mathematics does not play a major role here.<br />
<br />
22/7 or &quot;Nanabun no Nijūni&quot; is an idol group that was formed in late 2016. The group itself consists of eleven members (2 + 2 + 7 = 11), eight of them appear here in the main anime (the other three will appear in the OVA, 13th episode).<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
With no idea in mind, our eight girls receive a mysterious letter that does not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333250">
        tell anything beside to meet in a zoo. From that point on, we get to know that they are the chosen ones to start a new idol group. Despite the different starting skills in singing and dancing, which is the most important thing for idols, they work together to improve their skills and knowledge. A deep friendship arises, together they manage to overcome hurdles and support each other.<br />
In the 21st century, AI (Artificial intelligence) is already an important part in our daily life. So is it possible to analyze everything and calculate even the perfect idol flow? Since all-important information (center position, performance times, etc.) is given by a mysterious &quot;wall&quot; from the headquarter and must be followed absolutely, this could be an indication of such an AI.<br />
However, we are humans and not machines, we know sadness, we know what makes us happy, me know the feeling of losing important things. Do we really have to do everything the AI suggests? Our girls also face this hurdle, because the AI demands many things that cannot be understood by humans.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
The first three episodes are focusing on the center member Miu. She is a very shy girl and had little confidence in the whole idol thing at the beginning. She did not want to become an idol even. We get to know her background situation in detail.<br />
Nevertheless, all eight members will already be seen in the first episode. After the first three episode, we will learn more and more about each girl. The background stories of them are very touching, some are also very sad. Instead of thinking negatively, they want to transmit new positive energy to people with their songs. All of the girls had a different past, but fate (and AI) brought them together as a unit. Together they spread the happiness among the people and can solve all problems! The harmony between them is definitely there.<br />
<br />
ART:<br />
The animations are a little different from their music videos, which were produced before the anime. It is definitely smoother and better now. The girls are portrayed sweetly, as it is often the case in idol anime.<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
One of the most important thing for a good idol anime in my opinion. Although the group has released only four singles yet, it is fun to hear their songs, idol music to brighten up your day. The entire 22/7 group also sing OP and ED. Each character will have their own unique ending song during the anime also. Idol music should spread a good mood and joy among its fans and listeners, their songs certainly succeeded in that way.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
I was looking forward every Saturday for a new episode of 22/7. I really like the new idea of 22/7 that differs from e.g. Love Live! or Re: Stage Dream Days. The &quot;AI wall&quot; is certainly an interesting thing that is not known from other idol anime. It reflects the power of AI nowadays.<br />
Besides that new idea, I really enjoyed the characters. We learn a lot about them and as a result they grow close to our hearts. The support of each other in difficult situations is really very touching. You can feel the love between them.<br />
<br />
For idol fans (like myself), 22/7 is definitely a recommendation. You will have cute girls, good music and an unique story line.<br />
<br />
(Looking forward for the OVA and hopefully a second season already!)

    Takigawa Miu<br />
<br />
It all started with Takigawa Miu, a shy and anti-social girl. One day Miu found a letter containing an invitation to join an idol named 22/7. The idol group which consists of 8 member, has its own story. in each episode there is a background and reasons for how these 8 member arrived at 22/7. There are lots of anime titles out there like this but none are as unique as 22/7.<br />
<br />
Carrying the theme of idol, this anime does not only contain girls singing, dancing, or cheering. what makes this interesting is that it contains not only those 3 things, but this anime is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333230">
        actually full of flashbacks or backgrounds of each character.<br />
<br />
In addition, the song was beautiful, the rhythm of the music hummed melodiously. but unfortunately 22/7 shows very few concerts.<br />
<br />
Although rarely appear this anime is worth watching and the idol anime should be like 22/7. Not only rely on songs, anime idols must also have a clear background and purpose about the idol itself.<br />
<br />
I know all of this is only for money, promotion, or fame but there is no harm in experimenting, because there are still many opportunities out there, like the sky does not end.

    Oh hey, another idol anime! How does this one match up to the rest?<br />
<br />
While 22/7 won&#039;t blow anyone out the water, it certainly is a good watch as far as I&#039;m concerned. I find it quite unique that the idols themselves are voicing the characters, it&#039;s a really nice touch. I really like Miu&#039;s voice overall, while it was strange at first, it felt different than normal anime voices you here. So a plus there.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Miu, she&#039;s quite the character. She reminds me a lot of Megumi from Food Wars. Got talent, just needs confidence brought into her. Which will drive the show forward,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328060">
        as with her personality, you&#039;ll only hope for the best for her, and the rest! As for other cast members? While they might have usual anime personalities, I feel like they mesh well enough to make an enjoyable and heartwarming cast. I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll know even more about them as the show goes on to like them even more, and to make them stand out!<br />
<br />
For the story itself? It&#039;s strange, and has a little sense of mystery with this &#039;wall&#039; thing. Though wouldn&#039;t be surprised if many girls chosen to form an idol group wouldn&#039;t be a common thing. I could be wrong, but the wall might know something if this turns out well, so I&#039;m curious to find out.<br />
<br />
The art is what you would expect from an idol anime. Rather pretty, bright and colourful. Which is great to see. I really like how when they&#039;re performing, they have a certain style, and when close up, it&#039;s normal anime style. Which I also find neat. The music and sound in general is really smashing too.<br />
<br />
22/7 won&#039;t be the best anime, but it&#039;s certainly a good watch. So give it a chance!

    22/7 is one of the best idol anime I&#039;ve ever seen. It&#039;s true that I was skeptical for the first two episodes, but by episode 3 I was hooked.<br />
<br />
The first episode had me questioning what was actually going on, as there was so much to think about concerning that wall, or as I like to call it, The magic Conch. I couldn&#039;t tell you if episode 1 was good at all though, i couldn&#039;t rate the series from it&#039;s first episode alone, and I still find myself unable to rate the first episode.<br />
<br />
Around episode 3, the series gives the hook, with strong character writing, directing,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331172">
        and animation. Episode 7 had found a way to animate someone crying so well that I myself started crying, it was that good.<br />
<br />
The directing of the series is on point, and feels very impactful, doing things like using a cherry blossom tree dying in tandem with a backstory character dying. The series is kind of predictable, but that&#039;s not a bad thing in my opinion, it&#039;s how it&#039;s executed that matters most, and the execution is amazing.<br />
<br />
PRAISE THE MAGIC CONCH!

    Real time: I&#039;ve never been a fan of idols, both the Western kind or Japan&#039;s versions of them. The same goes for idol-based anime, mostly because many of them tend to be formulaic or of poor quality. There have been some good ones, but I&#039;ve seen very few of them. Honestly, the only idol anime I can say that I really love is Fancy Lala, and even that&#039;s stretching it, as Fancy Lala&#039;s focus isn&#039;t really on being an idol. I haven&#039;t seen either The IdolM@ster nor Wake Up Girls (I do plan to see the former later on), AKB0048 was fun and ambitious though

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333338">
        kind of stupid at times, I&#039;ve heard great things about Skip Beat and ZombieLand Saga, but again, haven&#039;t seen them. I like Aikatsu well enough, though it is a show aimed at children and is much more on the silly, idealistic side of things, and anyone who&#039;s talked to me at all knows I&#039;m not touching Love Live with a ten foot pole, mostly because of the fact that it plays sexual harassment for comedy, and that absolutely does not sit right with me. I wasn&#039;t intending on watching the newest idol anime, 22/7, but reading someone&#039;s review of the first episode had me intrigued, because it had a main character who was very cynical and bitter, far from your typical idol anime protagonist, and it had an interesting, if stupid premise. I know nothing of the actual real life idol group 22/7, so the review will solely focus on the anime. To be honest, the first episode did win me over, and I was really hoping this would be good. And it tried. It really tried...but it fell flat on its face. Big time.<br />
<br />
So what&#039;s the story? It begins with a girl named Miu who finds a mysterious letter in her mail. She and seven other girls are made to gather at a zoo, and a man named Gouda takes them down to an underground facility. There, they find out that they&#039;ve all been recruited to start an idol group called 22/7, and everything they do is going to be dictated by a magical, sentient wall that spits orders on brass plates. In order to be successful, they have to follow the wall&#039;s orders to the letter. Understandably, many of the girls don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on and are opposed to it, Miu especially, as she&#039;s not too keen on the idea of being used to fulfill someone else&#039;s whims, wall or no. But then she gets fired from her job, and has no source of income. Reluctantly, she and the other girls return to the facility and decide to become the idol group 22/7, though they still have no idea what the wall even is or why they have to do everything it tells them to do.<br />
<br />
Yeah. The idea of a sentient wall dictating an entire idol group is pretty hilarious in how stupid it sounds, and it&#039;s inspired many a joke since the anime&#039;s premiere. But if you ignore that, the anime promised to be a more cynical, realistic look at the idol business, not unlike Wake Up Girls. And for the first four or so episodes, the anime seemed to hit the ground running. It has smooth, stunning animation, though not without the occasional glaring CGI, great music, Miu is a great, refreshing protagonist who actually had flaws she needed to overcome, and the anime seemed to actually care about characterization rather than making the girls into one note moe archetypes. In all honesty, 22/7 could have really been something great, and it promised to try and stand out from the sea of bad idol anime. So what went wrong? Why the low rating? Well...a lot of things.<br />
<br />
First off, for an anime about a group of idol singers, it doesn&#039;t really highlight a lot of things that are important to showing the girls becoming idols. We never see them take dance lessons or record songs in a recording booth, other than, like, one single scene and that&#039;s it. We rarely, if ever, see them actually putting in effort or learning about the ins and outs of the idol industry, and those things are really important if you want to show these girls growing as both individuals and as a group. Say what you will about Aikatsu, but it at least showed the girls taking the time to practice, train, and go deep into the business practices that make idols what they are. Even Fancy Lala didn&#039;t simply gloss over these important details, as it knew they were really important if it wanted to show how the idol industry worked. There&#039;s only one scene in episode 3 where the girls are having their first concert and have to deal with bad audio equipment, but it gets resolved right away and leaves no impact whatsoever. For what its worth, the actual soundtrack is good, and the songs are well sung, but I only have one issue with the opening theme: It seems to just cut off at the end, like it didn&#039;t have time to really wrap up before the show was set to start.<br />
<br />
The second main problem is the series&#039; overall structure. Every episode has two parts to it, with one half taking place in the present, showing the girls&#039; activities, and the other half consisting of flashbacks to the girls&#039; backstories, showing how they got to be where they are. But this can be a double edged sword, and without the right balance, this can really make or break a show, and not only does 22/7 suffer from this, its way of inserting flashbacks in their episodes results in a weird tonal whiplash. For example, episode 6 begins with Reika, as a baby, nearly dying of some unknown illness, with her mother doing so later, and the next scene? Bam! Girls at the beach in their swimsuits! Can you see how jarring that type of transition can be? 22/7 can be at its best when it actually puts effort into tying the girls&#039; pasts to current events (Sakura&#039;s episode being one such example), but at its worst when it&#039;s unable to find that balance (Again, Reika&#039;s episode). Because of the way the episodes are made, the show tends to gloss over things that are important while putting too much focus on things that don&#039;t really mean much in the big picture. For example, various episodes imply that Sakura returning to America is going to be important, but nothing ever comes out of it, and that plot thread is never resolved.<br />
<br />
If I could use one word to describe 22/7 in a nutshell, it&#039;d be...contradictory. The writing for this show is really inconsistent and it&#039;s like the writers don&#039;t really know what they want to do with their characters most of the time, Nicole being an example in that early on, she&#039;s established as a haughty, bitchy character, but she&#039;s occasionally nice to the girls, and just seems to flip-flop between the two personalities without a real reason for being either one. Not even her focus episode sheds any light on why she&#039;s so needlessly mean to the other girls. Some characters are better than others, with Miu being the standout example. In my opinion, I feel she&#039;s the best character. Both her backstory and personality are down to earth, and she&#039;s such a refreshing change from the happy, optimistic idol series mains who want to be idols, though I will admit, her low pitched voice really isn&#039;t going to win her any Oscars. But again, as the show loses steam halfway through its run, Miu&#039;s original personality seems to disappear until the very end. Ayaka is pretty much a non-entity as a character and her reasons for being an idol are...really stupid and dumb, and poor Reika really got the shaft, because her episode was not only poorly written and endorsed a bad message (Reika doesn&#039;t want to wear a skimpy swimsuit for a photo shoot because she doesn&#039;t want to be a teenage sex object, which would normally be valid and understandable? Too bad! Get in the bikini, Reika!), but was really sexist. Jun&#039;s episode wasn&#039;t much better: What do you do when all your idols save for one get sick from food poisoning? Instead of postponing their jobs and waiting a day for everyone to be back to normal, let&#039;s completely overwork a 15-year-old girl by having her do a crap ton of jobs, even the ones her idol friends were supposed to do, over the course of an entire day!<br />
<br />
Which then leads me to the show&#039;s biggest problem: The characters as individuals are fine, though kind of bland, but since we never really get to watch them evolve and grow as a group, any pathos that comes from events such as breaking up doesn&#039;t feel earned in spite of the show&#039;s attempts to milk as much drama as possible. We never really see them truly come together as a group despite the show&#039;s attempts at telling us that they&#039;re awesome as a group, because, you know, we never see them doing stuff like dance lessons or recording songs or actually working together. Basically, the show is paying lip service to the idea of developing them as a group. I think the show might have done better had it just focused on Miu and cut down the flashbacks in favor of putting more time into having the girls learn to function as a group, like the show tries to advertise. Finally, we don&#039;t learn much about the wall, and even at the end, what the hell it even is is never really resolved, making it yet another plot thread that&#039;s been abandoned for the sake of idol flashiness.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a shame that 22/7 turned out this way, as I really wanted to like this show. The first three episodes were great, but after that, it loses steam quickly and just ends on a whimper, too caught up in its own hubris to really attempt something meaningful. Then again, this is another commerical for a famous idol group, so I guess it turning out the way it did was inevitable. I mean, I&#039;ll still watch this over Love Live (Except episode 6. Screw that episode in the eye), but it&#039;s an idol show that tried, and failed, to stand out from the oversaturated genre, and just didn&#039;t deliver.

    22/7 I really thought that this would be a new kind of revolucionary idol anime, but oh i was totally wrong, 22/7 tell us the story of Miu takigawa, a shy and socially awkward girl, one day she receives one mysterious letter from a corporation call G.I Productions; the letter says that they are offering her to be an idol, miu take that letter as a Joke, and she just continue with her life, but eventually some circunstances like she getting fired, and the urgent need of money make her take the decision to actually go to the place where the mysterious letter tell her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332429">
        to go, there she will meet with other girls and thats basically all.<br />
<br />
Story 4/10<br />
<br />
Lets start with the story, its bad, initially the episode 1 was nice it show us that maybe 22/7 will be an interesting idol anime but it wasnt, lets start talking about the Wall, the wall is a Wall that send orders to the corporation that make the girls of the group form 22/7 but that its it just sends orders, and also YOU CANT DISOBEY THE WALL, thats what that the &quot;mananger&quot; says to the idols, but what are the consecuences what is the wall, why you cant disobey it, THEY NEVER TELL US THAT , is just bad, its like the creators of the series didnt even try to make a history, they just make the wall to avoid making history, what i mean is that  the plot is &quot;empty&quot; the idols dont even have to try because theres a corporation that come out of nowhere to turn them into idols, and they even dont have to take hard decisions because the all mighty wall tell them what to do.<br />
Eventually with the past of the episodes i visualize what would happen in the next episodes, they just will show us the sad past of all the idols and the progress in their carreers but without obstacles because the all mighty wall and the corporations is there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art 3/10<br />
<br />
Well the art was good, the colors match up well BUT, that CGI hurt my eyes, the CGI was ugly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound  8/10 <br />
<br />
I mean its an idol anime, the songs were good i personally think it was the best thing about the anime, the songs arent masterpieces but they are good, also i apreciate the fact that they made or put a different song for each episode ending, i especially enjoy the episode 3 ending song.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character 3/10<br />
<br />
All the girls except for miu the protagonist have the most cliche personalities, im not a professional in idol animes i have barely seen 5 idol animes but I can compare all of the girls&#039; personalities (not worth mentioning their names) with any other personality from any other idol anime (that i have seen), maybe I haven&#039;t seen 100 idol anime but the personalities clearly are not something to stand out from 22 / 7.<br />
And talking about other character that arent the idols the mananger is another blank character same as the most part of the characters in this show.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 3/10 <br />
<br />
As i say before im pretty dissapointed with this anime, some things were good at the beginning but in the episode 3 the show start going completly shitty, with the plot of the wall and the corporation with the past of the girls the could make a incredible story, just imagine a psychological drama, The girls and their &quot;sad stories&quot; and what being an idol means to them, like the fight between Nicole and Miu because the wall want the shy miu in the middle of the dance and Nicole dream to be an idol, the creators could make a better plot for the wall beyond being an excuse for making a better plot.<br />
At least the songs were kinda good. <br />
<br />
Overall 3/10<br />
<br />
22/7 Start with a good episode one showing more drama than idols and that was actually good but start turning bad until the show end up being a non memorable and cliche idol anime.<br />
My final conclusion is that the only thing 22/7 had to do was follow an unexplored plot that has not been seen before in any idol anime.<br />
22/7 (at least in my case) failed on doing the most important thing, making me feel the drama and making me feel empathy with the sad past of the group members.<br />
<br />
And Yes i know that the anime is based on a real idol group.<br />

    (Contains spoilers in order to contextualize the review)<br />
<br />
22/7&#039;s anime tries to be many things at once and somehow fails at all of them, leaving the viewers with a frustating and pointless experience. For long time 22/7 fans, it almost feels like a joke.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been following 22/7 since the characters were but designs created by various artists. Next to each design, there were also small descriptions of how each girl was like - Sakura&#039;s, for example, mentioned a &#039;dark past&#039;. Knowing that Akimoto-P was behind the project, any idol fan would keep their eyes open for where 22/7 would go next.<br />
<br />
As a real life idol group,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338712">
        they&#039;re great. Their songs are catchy and the relationship between the members is enjoyable to read and watch about in their lives, video clips, and their youtube channels. They&#039;re in no way industry professionals, however. Comparing their voice acting from the first to the last song, you can see how they&#039;ve improved. There are documentaries and interviews you can read to take a peek into how the group works. These improvements were fought for by each of the girls, from their hard work as a group. <br />
<br />
So, we can conclude that 22/7 is a group with plenty of struggles in real life. What did the anime project do with these struggles? Did they show how one seiyuu had difficulty keeping up with the dances, or how one had to turn their life around in a new country? Would they adapt the character descriptions into interesting and relatable storylines?<br />
<br />
No. No, they didn&#039;t. Instead, they made this... bizarre animation that doesn&#039;t know what it wants. Is it an anime about the idol industry? Is it about how the group came together? Or is it about each of the members&#039; pasts? I don&#039;t think anybody knows.<br />
<br />
22/7 throws these subjects at you with little rhyme or reason, and expects you to get engaged with it. One moment, we see a baby girl almost dying. Then, SWIMSUIT SCENE! Oops, wait, the girl actually hates the swimsuit and this sexualization is really harmful - haha just kidding, look at how close the members are! The end!<br />
<br />
Seriously. That&#039;s basically how Reika&#039;s episode went.<br />
<br />
None of the plotlines above ever really went anywhere - they get dropped in and out like hot potatoes, then the episode ends. Add that with baffling logic, (WHY WOULD YOU MAKE JUN TAKE CARE OF *EVERYONE&#039;S* SCHEDULES INSTEAD OF RESCHEDULING THEM? WHY? NO REAL LIFE GROUP DOES THIS!) meh animation with many shortcuts taken thanks to a clearly small budget, and a lack of any stakes at all in the plot - that&#039;s 22/7. A big blend of many things. <br />
<br />
The absolute joke - especially for long time 22/7 fans - lies in that last point. The plot has no stakes at all in it. We don&#039;t see the girls (other than Miu in her centric episode) struggle with idol stuff. In the second episode, they hold an audition. Wouldn&#039;t that be the perfect time to show each member&#039;s strengths and weaknesses? Sure, we know Nicole is perfect and Miu has no confidence, but what about Sakura? Does she have trouble with the dancing? What is Akane good at? What were the good and bad points in Reika&#039;s audition?<br />
<br />
None of that matters. Their struggles and hard work don&#039;t matter. Everything is decided by the Wall, and it is always right. They don&#039;t have any trouble in securing fans and getting a spot in a magazine. Everyone just loves them. Everyone talks about them. All they have to do is follow the Wall. It&#039;s bordeline offensive for a group that barely broke 6,000 units sold in their first single. What was the message the writers were trying to sell here?! <br />
<br />
Even in AKB0048 there were stakes and struggles - the girls had rivals, senpais, they had their weaknesses and strengths - and they had a character that was very similiar to the wall! Love Live had each girl fight their personal issues and come together to save the place they loved, they had rivals and competitions. Heck, even Wake Up Girls had the members struggle with getting recognized and getting fans! <br />
<br />
22/7 failed to be an interesting idol anime, it failed to be even fanservice to hardcore fans. It didn&#039;t know what it wanted to be, and these flaws are so apparent it&#039;s hard to take the serious and emotional scenes seriously. It&#039;s a shame that a group that I enjoy and support so much ended up with this mashed mess of an animation to its name.<br />
<br />
Do yourself a favor and skip this one if you don&#039;t know the group - go watch the interviews, the lives, and the MVs. Listen to the songs. Don&#039;t waste your time with this anime.

    Story:<br />
I never have been a fan of idols anime but this was different in a way where an AI machine in a shape of a wall gives orders to the idols by printing words on a sheet of steel and all of it&#039;s order always has a reason. I liked the story because it&#039;s very mysterious and different than the other idol animes like &quot;Love live&quot; I always keep thinking what will the next order will be. The Wall never seems to let me down with it&#039;s orders sometimes the orders are hard and sometimes it&#039;s confusing but the girls always seems to do it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333446">
        since nothing is impossible right?<br />
The title of the anime is 22/7 which is also mysterious It&#039;s like the AI used PI as it&#039;s general calculation to evaluate how will the girls be famous cause at the beginning of the anime it looked like the girls were choosen randomly but they were not it&#039;s amazing how the Wall chosed the girls.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
I mean ofcourse it&#039;s coming from A1 pictures the sutdio that produced &quot;Sword art online, Violet Evergarden, Your lie in april&quot;<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
idk what to say about sound nothing related tio sound seems to bother me so just give it a 9.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
The girls are cute and had different personalities from kuuderes to deredere&#039;s  they had such sad Story from back when they were kids those memories are what builds them after all, each episode will reveal the secret life of the girls one by one so far &quot;Jun toda&quot; was the saddest.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Did I enjoy? Yes. Ever felt bored? No. Anything that might make you want to drop the anime? Probably because it&#039;s an idol but I stayed because of the cute girls and the Wall&#039;s orders but still because it&#039;s an idol anime you get to feel the hardships of the girls and how hard it was to become an idol.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I do recommend u to watch it if like a new way to watch an Idol anime.

    After years of waiting and several OVAs, finally 22/7 fans got what we’d been wanting, a well done anime. <br />
<br />
22/7 is based on the 22/7 multimedia project which was started about 4 years ago. The anime follows the origins of the group and their first year or so together. Unlike traditional idol shows that I’ve seen, 22/7 takes a grittier and dare I say it, darker approach to the idol genre. <br />
<br />
From the get go, we see it’s not all rainbows and sunshines in this world. This just feels pretty real. The colour palette even reflects it, opting for more muted shades and tones. This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333252">
        isn’t edge for the sake of edge, however. The reasons for this are all well explained and the issues each of the girls have are all given their own episodes to be explored. <br />
<br />
The series is very much character driven as you would expect from an idol anime. Every episode essentially deals with one of the girls’ backstory and gives them necessary characterisation and development. From bullying, to the deaths of family members, every girl has been through some realistic rough periods and holding baggage from that. By the end of each episode, you’ll have come to appreciate a new girl and understand why they’re the way they are.<br />
<br />
As for the technical aspects of the show, A-1 employed the same character designer from K-on and several other Kyoani series to do the character designs for 22/7. If you’re a fan of that art style, you’ll love the art here. The show features a darker colour palette which I believe serves the tone well. The Voice Acting is absolutely phenomenal and consistently does a great job of making every girl feel alive. As with any idol show, the OST is mainly songs from the group themselves and are all very enjoyable. <br />
<br />
22/7 is my favourite idol group and the show has gone on to become my fave idol show. It was a blast to see these girls come to life with a cool story, good voice acting and great direction. I certainly believe the low ratings are harsh and unearned. If you’re a fan of idol shows, which many in the west are not, give it a try. I don’t think you’ll be disappointed. <br />
<br />
22/7 gets 8 letters out of 10 from me.

    What is this? Is this another Idol-based Anime?<br />
<br />
Yes and no... this is one of the titles that&#039;s shamelessly going to be overlooked because idol Anime might have a stigma that they are all the same. It&#039;s just young girls acting cute in from of the stage, isn&#039;t it?<br />
<br />
Well, the difference between this show and perhaps many, is that this show takes a somber route. We start off the show being introduced to Miyu. Miyu isn&#039;t the most social person possible and she doesn&#039;t have a positive outlook to the adult world. She gets given an invitation to join in to become an idol with several

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333294">
        girls that have been called in to become the unit known as, 22/7.<br />
<br />
At first, she wasn&#039;t very motivated because she already had the job to support her family but eventually, she gets laid off and decided to join in the group. Her story is very relatable.<br />
<br />
Throughout the duration of the series, we start to look into the other members&#039; backstories and one is heartbreaking and heart-wrenching than the other. It shows the pain that everyone of the girls have  went through before joining in the idol group. There are so many tear-jerking moments and once they start singing together, you can sense the tears of joy from inside. These girls feel like human and it could happen to anyone around. They all come across extremely likable through what they went through.<br />
<br />
One thing that I also enjoyed about this Anime is the music. The music does play a bit part of the show from the intro, that is beautifully somber, and every ending, starting from episode 4, has its own song and theme related to that character&#039;s backstory that we&#039;ve been through. That makes every character shine and stick with you in your mind. They make everyone really important and not just the main character and even though, she&#039;s still my favorite out of the eight ladies.<br />
<br />
This show went from a 7 to a solid 9 because the last episode, it brought a shine to everyone and honestly, it almost made me tear up from this journey. I do recommend this title if you enjoy idol shows with a bittersweet/somber mood to it.

    5 - There was something you enjoyed. Still a bit forgettable, but not a waste of time.<br />
<br />
So this is a 5, but a good 5. Simply put, I&#039;m not too much of a fan of Idol stuff. Even Zombieland Saga barely got a 7 for me, and I&#039;d imagine that&#039;s a top tier Idol anime- although I don&#039;t know for sure because I haven&#039;t watched more than like 3. <br />
<br />
Tips and guidelines says don&#039;t include story summaries, but it is important to point out the key point of this idol anime. It doesn&#039;t focus at all on the dancing or singing. Instead it focuses on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335561">
        the life of someone who is an idol, and that if very interesting. It is interesting seeing the things an idol group me go through on a day to day basis on how to be successful. Being told what to do and to follow directions.<br />
<br />
The other key point is that almost each episode is catered to a member&#039;s pass. Jun having the best episode and story in episode 7, though none of the others really compare to her. Her episode was truly great. It definitely stood out, and I do think it was a turning point to the anime as the story did get somewhat better. The final two episodes were also fine.<br />
<br />
It just doesn&#039;t really stand it. It does feel a bit stale, certainly doesnt make me want to seek out the real idol group. It could have done a better job building the relationship between the members, their hardships, and how they were overcame. <br />
<br />
I enjoyed this because it gave a perspective to idols I may have never cared for. The background stuff that the public doesn&#039;t always see. There&#039;s no real drama, but just a certain members difficulty in life and trying to be a better person. Being an idol is not easy, and this anime showcases that.<br />
<br />
However, like I said before, it doesnt make me want to watch it again. I&#039;m good on one watch, and sometimes I flat out wasnt even paying attention. I would not recommended this for a weekend binge unless you are a fan of 22/7 or idol groups in general. <br />
<br />

    I don&#039;t really like idol anime at all. In fact, I believe this is the second idol anime I have ever watched.<br />
&quot;Well dumb dumb, why did you watch an idol anime?&quot; Well, I believe you always gotta give things a shot before you rate something badly. And well, I gave it a shot, I guess.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m just going to give a very quick run down of my experience:<br />
<br />
Well, in the very first minute of the show, you already know you&#039;re going to hear the main character is &quot;edgy,&quot; &quot;depressed,&quot; and will get some &quot;emotional support&quot; or whatever down the line.<br />
<br />
In the first 5 minutes, I had

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335174">
        some predictions:<br />
1. MC will be center (well duh, probably should have known by minute 0)<br />
2. MC will be conflicted about joining an idol group and there&#039;ll be some stupid group emotional/cheering up bs.<br />
3. MC will be bullied or whatever by her idol groupmates<br />
4. MC will drastically change personality to lead the group to victory<br />
5. MC will be &quot;forced&quot; to join the idol group<br />
<br />
Anyways, what am I trying to say? I&#039;m saying that the plot is very predictable despite advertising it as &quot;mysterious&quot; due to the &quot;WALL&quot; giving orders. It&#039;s not exactly mysterious if I can predict everything that&#039;s going to happen since the plot is terribly linear. You might say that my predictions were very basic and generic, but honestly, I should still expect something more.<br />
<br />
Also, the MC is just incredibly insufferable. Just wow. Going to just paraphrase here, but she basically states that &quot;adults are selfish, people lie, I can&#039;t stand those types of people. I can&#039;t make basic conversation, because that involves exaggeration and lying.&quot; To me, it kind of just sounded conceited and egotistical. Wow, you&#039;re special because you aren&#039;t like the rest. Wow, you&#039;re actually just a better human being! Better just scoff at everyone else for being below you. Oh, but on the outside, she&#039;s polite and apologizing. Wait a second...wasn&#039;t she just the person who was complaining about people lying? Also, for a person who hates people who lies, she certainly can&#039;t take any honest criticism at anyone. Wasn&#039;t that what you wanted buddy? And, she&#039;ll basically take any compliment and take it at face value. Don&#039;t people lie? Hello? I would get it if this anime was a coming of age story like March Comes in Like a Lion, but it&#039;s an idol anime. Her &quot;depression&quot; gets better within a few blinks of an eye to progress the plot. I mean, it makes sense. It&#039;s not really the main focus of the show, so why her personality so complicated to transition to an idol in the first place? Did you think having a &quot;different&quot; MC than your standard idol anime would somehow make the show better? Well, maybe, if it made sense or was executed well.<br />
And that brings me up to the second point. Sure, it&#039;s kind of &quot;unique&quot; I guess, to have something supernatural like the &quot;Wall&quot; being involved in an anime. But don&#039;t you think something like the &quot;wall&quot; being very disharmonious with the idol anime premise? The girls act like they have to play a damn death game of something when the order is something stupid like &quot;play some music.&quot;<br />
CGI is also bad. What did you expect from an anime?<br />
I couldn&#039;t take it all of these points. I peeked at the last 4-5 episodes, and it was stuff that I probably would have predicted because it was so basic. So it was dropped.

    22/7 is an idol group created by Yasushi Akimoto of AKB48 fame. They are described as “idols who transcend dimensions” meaning that they exist in more than one dimension, yes, they exist in 3-D and in 2-D and in 3-D (animated and motion-captured). But it gets tricky because the series is fictionalized but the idol group isn’t. The voice actors are actual idols from the actual idol-group 22/7, hence the voice acting is horrendous, but the characters they play are utterly and completely fiction. So really what transcends dimensions is the name 22/7.<br />
<br />
22/7 is an anime about random girls who were chosen randomly for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334966">
        purpose of being idols. They met their manager who does everything in his power to make the girls successful by following the commands of the wall; a mysterious entity of nebulous origin that gives orders via a credit card shaped and sized metal card. You might be forgiven if you think that this is perhaps a genre deconstruction or a dark retelling of the idol anime genre. All the signs pointed to it: the ominous wall, a mysterious company that built the wall, the manner in which the group was formed. But the creators had a different idea.<br />
<br />
What we got instead was a good and enjoyable show. Sure I was disappointed no one died (I was hoping this was like Madoka Magica but with idols) but I was happy with the end result.<br />
<br />
The show wasn’t concerned about the idol business but was about the characters themselves. The show focused on almost entirely on the idols and their determination or lack thereof to be an idol and how being an idol influenced their lives. How the idol industry was portrayed was interesting. Being a real-life idol group, they had to show us the positives of the idol industry but the negatives weren’t completely avoided. This was refreshing because we know it’s not all cute uniforms and rainbows; even though they didn’t get into it as much as I let on (it was a couple of lines in one of the episodes).<br />
<br />
What surprised me was how relatable the characters were. They weren’t as ‘larger than life’ as you would expect idols to be, ‘Down to earth’ would be more appropriate. This was the secret spice. <br />
<br />
Another surprise was the lack of chemistry. Sure the group had their own cheer and whatnot not but they never seemed to mesh. That is due to two things. Bad Voice acting and the character arcs. You can’t expect us to believe they are friends if they don’t sound like it. The character arcs were good don’t get me wrong. They were entertaining, the stories were engaging but the problems the characters had they solved themselves. This isn’t bad in itself but the sense of unity was lost.    <br />
<br />
 I see this show as an experiment and maybe a cash grab. Idols were popular and so were anime idols so Yasushi got the idea to create an idol group that transcends dimensions. It wasn’t a bad idea and I would call it a success. The anime was actually good, enjoyable and might send me into a rabbit hole I have been avoiding these last couple of years, I might start watching Idol anime.<br />

    2. One episode into this anime and I&#039;m really questioning its existence on my to-watch list. If they were trying to be Love Live, which they weren&#039;t even going in the direction of this saturated milked franchise, it was just appalling.<br />
<br />
The most helpful review here by eff-fume pretty much sums up how I feel. Regardless of art and music by the AKB48 man himself Yasushi Akimoto because its not even that interesting since its the same idol formula, the worst worst absolute worst thing here is the voice acting.<br />
<br />
You are fortunate to have 6/8 of these idols to have decent voice acting and sound acting,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403904">
        but the protagonist Miu and her pissy rival who finds Miu&#039;s ideology annoying are absolutely appalling. Miu&#039;s voice is, I don&#039;t even know how to describe it: destroys any mood or joy you feel for her show. Not to mention her depressed teen angst who hates the world is really over-the-top annoying, and she is genuinely the first character from my entire life of watching anime where I&#039;ve actually felt that whatever I&#039;m listening is not a match with the lip/mouth animations. BECAUSE THE VOICE IS SO UNAPPEALING. Like idc what Miu&#039;s gender identity is supposed to be, I&#039;ve heard deep voiced manly women in my life that sound more women than Miu&#039;s non feminine/masculine, lost in grey and emptiness voice. Even when she&#039;s talknig about her family she sounds bloody dreadful.<br />
<br />
The short hair blondie Nicole who finds Miu annoying and is kind of pretentious, thank god she&#039;s better but if Miu&#039;s voice acting isi a 1/10, this girl is 2/10. SOmething feels SO OFF about it; she&#039;s accentuating every other word with an accent sound that doesn&#039;t even make sense, which no normal Japanese person speaks like that anyway, its like there&#039;s smt lodged in her throat. CHrist her singing voice. SHE&#039;S SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST OF THE BUNCH but you can hear how fake her voice is and how much throat voice she&#039;s using to hit those high notes that are just out of her range.<br />
<br />
Then of course stock / stereotypical characters that are just- sigh.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m going to stop watching this anime.<br />
<br />

    I love every single member from 22/7 with all my heart, and that&#039;s because this anime does a great job at presenting each member individually and also how they develop as a group. I know this sounds really generic but this anime really made me warm inside unlike any other idol anime has. It isn&#039;t anything new, but overall really great. I guess one thing I like is how the group is relatively small and there aren&#039;t any other groups (in the anime at least) so it can explore each member without leaving anyone behind within the given number of episodes, unlike for example bang

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349577">
        dream, where it has multiple groups and can only afford to focus on 1 or 2 in the anime.<br />
I won&#039;t spoil anything but I will say straight up the plot is a little strange for an idol anime, but I don&#039;t mind it too much since I think it helps with the development of the group in the unique way, just a heads up if you&#039;re not into that.<br />
Overall, stan 22/7 their music is bomb.

    Story 6/10<br />
<br />
A group of eight young women are brought together to form an idol group but this is no normal idol group brought together as a result of auditions but solely through the orders of the mysterious wall and as a result everything done by this group is ordered by the wall and must be obeyed regardless of whether the members of the group actually want to do it with some members not even wanting to be idols in the first place.<br />
<br />
I thought the whole wall thing was a bit silly although some arguments can be made that this is some sort of commentary on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346027">
        the modern world and idol culture which I can understand but personally I felt this hampered the story in some of the final episodes. Despite these issues I really liked how 22/7 focuses more on the characters and their side stories with every episode focusing on one of the group with their background and personality impacting their particular episode which was excellent and was one of the highlights of my experience with 22/7.<br />
<br />
Art 6/10<br />
<br />
The actual art here was pretty good for the most part however some of the CG animation looked noticeably janky when the group were performing.<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
<br />
As an idol show the music has to be excellent and I thought that it was with all the songs being the sort of enjoyable J-Pop Idol music that you would expect. The sound and voice acting was also good for the most part.<br />
<br />
Characters 8/10<br />
<br />
I did really like the characters here they are all different people with different personalities and the way they come together and help each other through the issues that they face is excellent I also liked the character development through focusing on each of the characters and their back stories on each episode.<br />
<br />
My personal favorite character was the center of the group Miu Takagawa she is a quiet girl who has a distrust for adults and doesn’t feel comfortable communicating with others this obviously makes it difficult for her to become an Idol something she has never wanted to be but she has also just lost her job and cares deeply for her mother and sister this love for her family leads to her showing her great determination when asked to join 22/7.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8/10<br />
<br />
I had a lot of fun here it mixes good music which likable characters and is very easy to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall 7/10  <br />

    “I hate adults. They segregate, command, direct and force. Idols are no better. They laugh at stupid things, shake their butts for customers, it&#039;s stupid! I came here to do the job I hate the most. To be an adult, I need to be good at it. To protect those precious to me. I&#039;ll do anything!&quot; MC at Ep 1.<br />
<br />
In society there’s a layer of social status that control us, ground worker must obey the higher up, adult giving nonsense order to youngster, etc. Even if the bottom people already fed up with all those bullsh!t but it can’t be helped, they keep endure it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394024">
        because it’s the way to be higher up adult themself. On another side, the above people did it also for the sake of their junior in life/work, or else workers would be slacking jobs, and teenagers would be walking in dark future path, etc.<br />
<br />
22/7 is not a pure idol anime, it’s more like a drama slice of life teenangers stepping into mature world facing the upcoming responsibilty being an adults, dealing with another higher adults, strugling between looking for jobs and/or chasing dream, but it all packed in an Idol themed genre as a medium. I repeat, it’s not an idol anime, so don’t worry too much if you don’t like idol anime, but if you already like idol anime please don’t demand too much about their concert.<br />
<br />
(+) This anime potrays really well about social levels. How an adults doing watever they want to youngster. At first, the order from higher ups might sound unreasonably absurd but as they follow properly, turns out it all went well in the end. Because a secret of parents in raising a child is the secret itself. Kids don’t need to know the details what happen in background. But as they became more mature, of course there’s a rebellion state as a sign they grow into adult themself. Here we see how idol work in realistic detail: training, concert, side-jobs, dailies etc. We also got the dark side of any workplace like distrust, disappointment, burdensome member, self-doubt, fatal mistake, etc.<br />
<br />
In fact 22/7 is an actual idol, more precisely a virtual idol. So characters got story from the actual member. Their 3D is using a motion-capture tech so it feels natural, including the anime. Handled by pro studio A1 Pict, delivers a smooth animation both 2D daily &amp; 3D concert. Since audition, backed up by Sony Music Records to find talents with great voice is easy. So don’t worry about sounds aspect, I like the unique voice of MC also the one with Kansai dialect, it’s easily recognizable. There’s a lot of good OST you might add to playlist. The OP, ED (Ep 1 3 4 OVA), &amp; insert Ep 3 8, is into my taste.<br />
<br />
(-)Yes, the story is realistic but not all humans life is interesting, 50% members have a flat plot (Ep 4 6 8 9). The first 3 Ep was a good start &amp; conclusion but members story in middle eps still missing a climax. Yet the OVA also didn’t bother to, it only introduce 3 new member &amp; nerfing one old member. Differentiating each members may not easy but not that hard, about 2-3 Ep needed to finally understand all 8 characteristic as summarized in Ep 3 at how they act when 1 by 1 entering building.<br />
<br />
Yes, the animation is smooth, but just from OP we can sense something wrong with their 3D anatomy. Ok, they want to keep realistic with motion-capture so It can’t be helped because logic in anime &amp; real life is different since start. Example the eye size, nose contour, neck length, head &amp; body proportions, etc. On 2D part, as the episodes progress we can feel a cut in budgets that result in some characters look similar. But since at that time we already know all members, this might not a big deal.<br />
<br />
Yes, their voice is pretty but most of member’s personal songs isn’t catchy like the group’s song. And if only have + budgets, they could at least make animated solo perform on each member ED. Also at Ep 8, the encore feel so cringe for new viewer, without that it would be the best perfom.<br />
<br />
(=) In the end this is a drama anime with some Idol theme, not an Idol anime with some drama. For you who like drama, this would be good also as a training if you plan to try pure Idol anime.

    The whole series was fair..<br />
There were some places I found it boring..<br />
The background of the characters had nothing to do with their selection.<br />
The episodes of every character was boring..<br />
The only thing I enjoyed were the songs and the music..<br />
Else was fine.. the animators did a fine job.. but I hoped the character designs to be a bit more vibrant and a bit of bright background..<br />
The character development of the wall is bad.. <br />
And what is the working system of the wall? An AI or Magic? <br />
<br />
<br />
Listen to their songs from their albums made me watch this anime.. but compared to the songs I am a
