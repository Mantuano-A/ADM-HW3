    The continuation of the ever-so-great series Tsubasa Chronicle, this OVA (Original Video Animation) series was as good as expected, maybe even better. The group we are familiar with has now entered a Tokyo in which all but two buildings has been destroyed by acid rain. They encounter new people, and as the title suggests, there&#039;s some revelations waiting for them as well as anyone who watch this.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the story. Albeit too rushed: I had trouble understanding at times, though everything&#039;s clear now. I think it could&#039;ve been twice the length it was without really being any worse. Anyway, it was really great, from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3361">
        the original Syaoran&#039;s and the Clone&#039;s awakening to the revelation of Fei Wong&#039;s plans and how much he has actually affected the group&#039;s journey so far.<br />

The animation style of this was... wow. At first, I was surprised to see a completely new animation style, but I soon got accustomed to it, and soon after I fell in love with it. It was a quantum leap in quality, which was most likely due to the fact that it was an OVA. If only the entire series had been like this... Oh, well. At any rate, you&#039;ll most likely enjoy the improved animation.<br />
<br />
The music in this series is - and will always be - legendary, at least in my heart. Nay but astounding pieces of music; themes and songs which I could listen to over and over again without growing bored of them (and so have I done). This is how an anime soundtrack should be, and I can almost certainly guarantee that you&#039;ll enjoy the music in this series.<br />
<br />
In this OVA, the characters experienced a change for the better; growing much more deeper. The characters were somewhat the same as the original series, but I felt that there were changes to them - both at the start of and during the series. Die-hard fans of the original series might get turned off by the fact that the characters changed a bit, but I felt that they were much more enjoyable, and I&#039;m sure you will too, even though you might require some time to get used to it.<br />
<br />
All in all, I really, really enjoyed the OVA; there were many changes for the better, but it also kept the best from the earlier seasons, making this much better. There are some changes you might have to get used to, and the story was definitely a bit rushed, but I can guarantee that you will enjoy this OVA at least as much as you enjoyed the original series.<br />

    I actually stumbled on this series by accident.  After only watching the first OVA i was enthralled.  The characters seemed to be extremely developed and have quite a lot of emotion infused into them, the animation was fluid and believable, the sound was above average, and it definitely kept me entertained.<br />
<br />
After finishing what OVAs were out I decided to watch the previous two seasons.  This was a bit of a mistake I am sad to say.  The TV series is slow and painfully full of filler.  Read the manga instead.<br />
<br />
The good news is that these OVAs return to the source

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2109">
        and appear to have eliminated the slow progression and needless blather.  Manga and general Tsubasa fans rejoice: this has a POINT!<br />
<br />
As an OVA there is no time to waste, no painfully slow panning across faces while playing the same tired song, simply to take up time.  This appears as if the story will actually progress and keep true the entire time.  I am looking forward to the continuation.

    Tsubasa Chronicle&#039;s anime experience has been a very rocky one. In spite of staying true to the manga to an extent, the original TV series was shameless in it&#039;s amateur art styl, jilted animation, and wholly uneven pacing. Fans got a brief look at something amazing when the short movie came out and wondered, &amp;quot;what if Production I.G. did the canon story of Tsubasa?&amp;quot;<br />
<br />
Wonder no more.<br />
<br />
Tsubasa Chronicle: Tokyo Revelations is quite literally a godsend, not only for the poor souls that suffered through the uninspired Bee Train adaptation, but also those (myself included) who felt the artwork and pacing for the manga chapters the OVA

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5948">
        covers were way off-balance. For the revelations at hand, no one delivers the goods better.<br />
<br />
First thing fans are going to recognize is the art style, which is much more defined and fluid than the TV series. The fight scenes are seamless and perfect in nearly every way, and backgrounds are fleshed out wonderfully. Moreso, the series&#039; shining point, the OST, is abundant here. Unlike the TV series, however, the OVA uses Yuki Kajiura&#039;s compositions minimally and saves the big pieces for dramatic effect. For me, the OST just got better. Also, I adore the melancholy OP.<br />
<br />
Of course, Tsubasa has a story and, in this case, one Bee Train decided to ignore completely due to the dark nature of the titular revelations. Production I.G. did not sway. Though some minor plot points are rearranged, everything flows and follows the manga as if you were watching a full-color, audio-enhanced slideshow of the chapter panels. Though these chapters suffer themselves from pacing, the OVA makes things clearer and much less muddled than the manga. Still, too much happens at once and the OVA faults in not giving each revelation enough due reaction with all that&#039;s going on.<br />
<br />
Naturally, characters also take some turns as this is the manga&#039;s turning point. And wow, what changes they are! Really, going any further would risk massive spoiler territory, but the OVA crams a series&#039; worth of character development into these 3 episodes. Phenomenal is an understatement, and the way the seiyuu handle these changes is nothing short of vocal mastery. It is easily the high point of this already excellent OVA.<br />
<br />
When everything comes together, it&#039;s definitely something worth appreciating, and one can only hope that more Tsubasa anime will follow from Production I.G. It is very much enjoyable, but it won&#039;t leave a serious impact on you. The only thing I really took from this was &amp;quot;this is Tsubasa done right&amp;quot;, but for me that is enough to warrant a high enjoyment rating.<br />
<br />
Overall, Tsubasa Chronicle: Tokyo Revelations gets a 9. Best anime adaption of the series to date, and excels beyond the manga in delivering the goods in a way that isn&#039;t horribly confusing.

    Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles was a great series in and of itself. It was portrayed in the anime in a very hit or miss fashion  with the quality and editting. The way Bee Train hurt Tsubasa is the equivalent of what 4kids does to anime here. Be that as it may, we&#039;re not talking about the original 2 seasons, i&#039;m here to recommend to you.<br />
<br />
Tsubasa Chronicle: Tokyo Revelations<br />
<br />
This OAV is astounding. The characters have more development then they did throughout the first two seasons. The art style was more defined, more &amp;quot;Mature&amp;quot; in the scope that Tsubasa truely is. Syaoran simply looked taller, more defined

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3257">
        and slender, like a cross between Kurogane and Fai, the way a main characters body should look.<br />
<br />
Following the manga pretty much to a T, the &amp;quot;Revelations&amp;quot; that are discovered and exposed in the dreary acid rain filled town that once was Tokyo, were mind blowing to me. Each character went through something big in just 3 episodes, and the best part is it didn&#039;t feel rushed. <br />
<br />
My enjoyment with these OAV&#039;s was through the roof. Seeing the characters for who they really are. It is indeed a must see if you love anything about Tsubasa.

    Let me start off by saying I am among a minority of critics that feels the Anime series is a work of misunderstood genius and I&#039;m probably the only one who&#039;s tired of the Bee Train haterz because OCD CLAMP fans can&#039;t stand anything that&#039;s different from the Manga.  That&#039;s not to say I don&#039;t recognize the flaws in Bee Train&#039;s TV anime series, but nothing is with out it&#039;s flaws.   With Tokyo Revelations being picked up by Production I.G from BEE TRAIN I wasn&#039;t sure what to really expect.<br />
<br />
That being said I&#039;ve always been a long Tsubasa fan more so because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10042">
        I&#039;ve enjoyed the story telling by CLAMP.   Tokyo Revelations I had mixed feelings going into, on the one hand I was delighted to see another anime adaption, on the other hand I wasn&#039;t particularly  looking forward to Production I.G&#039;s  new Gothic style.  But still I wanted to see if Tokyo was worth the hype and for the most part it is.<br />
<br />
Tokyo was very strange, dark and an extreme departure from the campy and brighter anime series broadcasted by NHK sure enough to please the OCD CLAMP fans.<br />
<br />
I want to talk about Nanase (or Aghea) Okawa&#039;s writing, which I found to be exceptional quality for her.   Mostly I&#039;ve known Okawa&#039;s screenwriting skills for my guilty pleasure series Cardcaptor Sakura.  Okawa brought out the strong writing that really attracted me to Tsubasa and held me as I read the Manga.  I haven&#039;t read since the end of the Ashura Arc (having already seen the Dangerous Race I didn&#039;t really want to read it again) anyway Okawa probably brought out the strongest story telling so far of any Tsubasa anime adaption, which something the series writer, Hiroyuki Kawasaki, couldn&#039;t quite accomplish  but still managed in spirit.   <br />
<br />
The dramatic and somber story telling was done in a very stylistic way that I wasn&#039;t expecting really.   The writing was action packed and dramatic with out being dark and mopey like other pseudo-Goth animes like Boogiepop or Serial Experiments Lain.   This also includes giving the much left out Sakura more of a central role and a pretty kick-ass story arc later, whereas in all earlier volumes of the manga and anime she has been the classical damsel in distress.  The awakening of the Clones was beyond strange yes, and even a little confusing but again Okawa wrote that in a sense that it was almost like watching a thriller as opposed to a fantasy.<br />
<br />
A highly unusual departure and downright scary it blew me away, it was intense and highly packed full emotion.   Overall you may be blown aback unless you just simply like this stuff to begin with.  <br />
<br />
The new art and character designs is to be expected with a new studio taking over the production, as such I&#039;m not a fan of the psudo-Gothic style of anime, so naturally, I can&#039;t say I particularly liked Yoko Kikuchi&#039;s new designs.  I did not care for the new animation style, I do want to say that director Shunsuke Tada was at least able to keep it balanced.  He didn&#039;t allow it to become overly saturated with blacks and shadows and dull unexpressive character designs and animation as most directors in this style do.   He allowed enough darkness to show a different style and allowed the tone and mood to be set to get us in the new world and not hit us over the head with it.  Tada has an easy style that is again often missed by most in this kind of Genre so my hat is off to him for keeping a relatively easy story line, and decent animation style.   But he dropped the ball in the Music Department overall.<br />
<br />
Music wise you&#039;ll notice 98% of the music is from the TV series slightly altered.  It&#039;s almost appalling that a production company of  I.G&#039;s status can&#039;t make a slightly more original, original soundtrack.  I&#039;m certainly glad they have been keeping Yuki Kajiura on as Composer since she was previously brought in under Koichi Mashimo&#039;s direction.   Whether simply Kajiura was too busy to write new material I don&#039;t know but this is one of the reason I find Koichi Mashimo and his company Bee Train to be above the par with most.   All I can say is if you are looking forward to another potentially great score, you&#039;ll be rather disappointed as I probably heard 5 new musical pieces including the opening theme and closing theme.  It&#039;s almost silly people have complained about repetitive music in the TV series when it&#039;s equally obvious in this OAV Series.<br />
<br />
However, the opening theme song Synchronicity once again shows off the immense talent Yui Makino has especially when she&#039;s working with Kajiura and Maaya Sakamoto delivers a pleasant and well crafted ending theme.  Both Kajiura and Sakamoto are talented writers, and both can do wonders if they are given the chance.  <br />
<br />
With the up and coming OAD&#039;s I really hope Tada get&#039;s his act together and starts having Kajiura write some newer compositions.   OAV or no OAV if you have a sequel make some new music, if BEE TRAIN could do it for their small 4 OAV series .hack//Liminality, surely a company like Production I.G can do it too.  (especially the way CLAMP fans have been making IG into a Mecca).<br />
<br />
Overall Revelations is worthy of a checkout and a full watch.  How much, is up to you.   I am happy to say it wasn&#039;t a waste of my time and I will look forward anything new I.G. brings to the Tsubasa Universe.  <br />
<br />

    Tsubasa Chronicle: Tokyo Revelations did what the rest of the anime series failed to do: be interesting. While the art style is more or less the same, it is obvious in the first few minutes that it has been supplemented with greater detail, some additional special effects here and there, and the animation seems to move more smoothly and remain more &amp;quot;active&amp;quot;, versus the all-too-boring and sluggish feel of Tsubasa Chronicle and Tsubasa Chronicle 2nd Season.<br />
<br />
Story: 8 - Very Good<br />
<br />
We all know the story of Tsubasa Chronicle from the manga, because chances are, if you are not a manga reader, you have not seen this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6323">
        OVA, and if you are not a manga reader, you stumbled upon it through recommendation or pure curiosity. My point is, I&#039;m not going to get into the story here because I&#039;m sure 90% of the people reading this know it more or less. It has a very good story for CLAMP material if you consider the manga and forget the abomination of an anime exists.<br />
<br />
Art: 9 - Great<br />
<br />
The art was very well done, but could have been better. I wasn&#039;t seeing anything in the art here that I haven&#039;t seen in other OVA productions before, nothing that really sets it apart and goes the extra mile. But it&#039;s definitely up there in the quality department. It&#039;s great.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9 - Great<br />
<br />
Good music, nice sound effects. The sound and music in this series does a good job in setting the mood and keeping it in check at the right moments, and changing when it should change. It&#039;s not extremely repetitive which is always good, and is nice to listen to. It&#039;s great, but at the same time there are a lot of OVAs out there which more or less match this series in terms of quality and the amount of effort (seemingly) put in. But it is very nice.<br />
<br />
Character: 7 - Good<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t go there since I&#039;m assuming you all know who the characters are and how they were developed in the manga, and further in this OVA. Character development in this show is pretty good, each character has a back-story that can be identified. However, overall, I don&#039;t find these characters all that interesting (except for Fai and Kurogane), or at least, as interesting as they could be. They tend to be repetitive in their actions, and become somewhat predictable. Not that this is a bad thing, it&#039;s simply not as interesting as compared to if they were to develop more to a point where their personality itself changed. That isn&#039;t the case in this series, after the initial character development, every is pretty much just static. It&#039;s not a bad thing, as I said, but it&#039;s not all that brilliant either. It&#039;s good the way it works out though, I suppose.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7 - Good<br />
<br />
This OVA was enjoyable, but nothing on a grandeur epic scale. Maybe it&#039;s because I knew exactly what was going to happen, or maybe it&#039;s because this particular arc in the story is only interesting closer to the middle and end. In any case, it was decent, and there were some parts I really did enjoy and was pleased with.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8 - Very Good<br />
<br />
This is a very good OVA for the typical Tsubasa Chronicle fan. You will not regret watching it, but you won&#039;t necessarily think it&#039;s the greatest thing since pie either. But heck, it&#039;s Tsubasa Chronicle, and you know you can&#039;t wait to see Kurogane open a can of whoop ass. It&#039;s definitely worth the watch, however if you are new to the series, I suggest you read the manga at least up to this arc first, or you will be lost, and if you do decide to read-back later to fill in the empty spots, you will just spoil it for yourself.<br />
<br />
So pick up Tsubasa RESERVOIR Chronicle and read it, and then supplement it with this wonderful OVA. The Menclave release comes highly recommended.

    I believe that Tsubasa Chronicle Tokyo Revelations was a fabulous continuation, giving us a clearer insight into the background of all the characters and the plot. For those who are slightly confused while having watched Tsubasa so far, these OVA&#039;s are of an extreme help in painting a more &#039;clearer&#039; picture of the story in general. It explains so much, while still providing us with even MORE surprises to keep our minds wheeling with excitement and curiosity. Compared to the seasons before, the artwork is exceptionally better and I also believe that the climax of the story still has yet to reach its peak. The

        more I keep watching Tsubasa, the more I get pulled in... I just can&#039;t seem to get enough of it! <br />
<br />
CardCaptor Sakura was a huge success, and so is Tsubasa Chronicle. I believe that the characters of both series are adored by its fans for the manga as well as the anime. So I don&#039;t doubt that there would be many disappointed hearts if talk of following seasons are discontinued. <br />
<br />
The story has yet to reveal itself, and something tells me that once the ending IS revealed, the entire story will suddenly fall into place and make everyone gasp in shock. Sakura and Syaoran still have much to endure together, and with the group by their side... their journey will definitely be more gratifying than the previous seasons before it. What will happen when Sakura finds all of her feathers, and what will become of her and Syaoran? <br />
<br />
I loved these OVA&#039;s, CCs, &amp;amp; all of Tsubasa Chronicle and I hope that it is decided to continue producing further seasons for us all!

Many might have wondered why Bee Train and NHK failed to adapt the glorious game-changing story arc that is Tokyo in the Tsubasa TV series. But even if you didn&#039;t look it up on TVTropes the reason behind this, it&#039;s not difficult to tell why NHK (producer of the fluffy and romantic Cardcaptor Sakura) refused to adapt the arc... after you have watched this OVA series. Disclaimer for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277203">
        the faint of heart: Tokyo Revelations is brutal, visually and emotionally.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Tokyo Arc&quot; features probably the most important character development in the entire story thus far, and it also surpasses all prior arcs in quality. Most impressive of all is its deconstruction of itself and the cliche of &quot;band of adventurers conveniently tagged along by companions with the proper skills and resources&quot; found in countless adventure stories. It also answers the question of what would happen if Sakura deprives a country of a feather that&#039;s an important power source to its citizens, a question that some viewers like myself have probably pondered prior to the Tokyo arc, I&#039;m sure.<br />
<br />
Understandably, NHK refused to adapt such a radical story arc that literally changes certain characters entirely - some of whom literally becoming unrecognizable from their prior self. After their refusal to compromise, CLAMP proceeded to disown the anime and terminate their business partnership with NHK and Bee Train as the artists felt the anime had trod down a path that&#039;s vastly different from what they had in mind following the Recort arc. And what CLAMP had in mind was not to continue on some merry journey having light laughs while teaching platitudes for the kiddies and offering gratuitous fanservice. Instead, what we have here are some very cruel character development that&#039;s true to Vonnegut&#039;s advice: Sakura is no longer a naive Mary-Sue, Fai ironically falls into deeper despair than right before Tokyo (when he had become more cheerful), Kurogane finally learns important information regarding his mother, and Syaoran... oh, poor Syaoran. If you thought Syaoran had it bad before in regards to Sakura&#039;s memory of him... his character is literally destroyed in this OVA. In short, the Tokyo arc is darker, edgier, and far more depressing than anything Tsubasa has dished out before.<br />
<br />
The animation team of Production I.G. behind the Tsubasa movie has returned, and with it the more detailed and crisper expressions. Aesthetically, everything has also become more graphic - and this is in spite of the censorship still present within some scenes. Blood is present now, as it should be since several scenes in the arc just don&#039;t carry the same emotional impact when you don&#039;t witness the grave injuries certain characters suffer. Even the OP theme is darker in tone with its melancholic lyrics and melody, signalling to the audience that from this point on, nothing will be the same ever again.<br />
<br />
While far more faithful to the manga than Bee Train has ever been, some content was yet again cut out for either censorship or time-constraint reasons. Being a standalone OVA, it&#039;s understandable that they had to cut down certain scenes and exposition that are unnecessary to understand the plot contained in this OVA, specifically Yuko&#039;s explanations regarding Fei Wang Reed. That said, along with the censorship still existent in an OVA, it&#039;s quite a disappointment they didn&#039;t manage to incorporate certain important plot elements in here, including the aforementioned explanation.<br />
<br />
But that&#039;s a nitpick at best, for Production I.G. has truly stood out with this amazing OVA that carried the same emotional resonance as the manga. The pain and suffering of the characters here (and boy, is there pain...) are beautifully animated in details. Along with its amazing voice work, I believe this is the best way to experience the Tokyo arc first hand as you&#039;ll undoubtedly grab for tissues crying along with our struggling heroes.

    ONLY for those who are already familiar with Tsubasa and even then probably only for those who have read the manga or have done some looking into outside of just watching the anime. Otherwise, you&#039;ll have little to no clue what is going on. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s hard to get plot specific without major spoilers, so I&#039;ll keep it generalized. Basically, since this anime was very clearly intended to have a third season and never did, I appreciate CLAMP going ahead and making these to try to compensate. They attack to resolve plot points, they reference characters and concepts hinted at earlier in the anime but never

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330906">
        actually seen and they try to stay as true as they can visually to the original concept. There are definitely a few noticeable animation differences as it was, in fact, drawn by a different studio. One that blatantly stands out to me is Mokona being way, way smaller than she is in the main series anime. <br />
<br />
A word of warning- this gets significantly darker, more violent, more bloody and far less cutesy than the main series. If you enjoyed the main series and thought it was cute and charming (and I&#039;d agree!) and a drastic tonal change would detract from your enjoyment perhaps it&#039;s best you don&#039;t watch these.<br />
<br />
A for effort for sure. Somewhere in the &quot;it&#039;s fine&quot; to &quot;it&#039;s pretty good I guess&quot; area for what you actually get. There is not, and never will be, any substitute for a proper season three that this anime desperately needs and deserves.

    This OVA was absolutely... AMAZING!<br />
<br />
It will leave you feeling breathless after seeing everything the characters have to go through.You will have your jaw hanging open, like a fish out of water. And the suspense will have you gripping your seat, wanting to know what happens after. You will be pulling out your hair from frustration by the ending of this. And you WILL be feeling... something after you see some of the revelations found out here.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t expect it to be this good. The first and second season had some slow moments sometimes, and after watching the Tsubasa movie i thought this OVA would be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27534">
        something like that.<br />
<br />
When i watched this i had just finished the 2nd season of Tsubasa and it was around 2am. I knew i had to go to sleep, but i decided to watch the first episode of Tokyo Revelations just to see how it was. I didn&#039;t expect to watch the whole thing that night, only the beginning or something so i could add it on my Ipod and watch it the next day when i was bored in class. <br />
<br />
However before i knew it, it was almost 4am and i had finished it Tsubasa Chronicles: Tokyo Revelations. I think i stared at my laptop for about 10 minutes, after i finished watching it, in shock. It just... raped my mind, and left me wanting to find out what would happen. It completely changed my view on the whole series and everything i knew!<br />
<br />
I really recommend watching this one even if you didn&#039;t like the first and second season a lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY (10/10):<br />
This OVA takes place right after they leave Record Country, the place that held the book of memories. Syaoran, Sakura, Fai, Kurogane, and Mokona end up in Tokyo Country, a blood-filled country  that has been destroyed by acid rain, where a war from opposing factions for natural resources and survival is going on. While they reluctantly get involved in the race to live, they faces their own problems as certain revelations are made, changing their journey forever.<br />
<br />
A shocking betrayal and a battle that risks all of their lives. After this revelation, they will never be the same again.<br />
<br />
<br />
ART (10/10):<br />
The Art in this OVA was astounding! It was weird at first considering i had just finished the second season and was used to the anime style there. However, i have to admit the art here is so much better. Syaoran looks older, taller, and more mature than in the first or second season. All the characters look more defined and well... &quot;mature&quot;. I don&#039;t know how to really explain it, but if you watch it you might understand what i mean.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND (10/10):<br />
The sound is perfect. I&#039;ve always loved the music the series used, and for this OVA is not any different. The opening song fits perfectly with the show in my opinion, and the background music through out, fits perfectly with whatever scene that is happening.<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTER (10/10):<br />
After watching the Characters through-out the series i fell in love with them, and after watching what they go through in here... my heart completely goes out to them. The risk and pain they go through had me screaming for the characters and wanting to pull my hair out.... or well one of the characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT (10/10):<br />
This is one of my favorite anime&#039;s out there, and i really enjoyed it. Even if i have seen it around 4 times already.<br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL (10/10):<br />
Like i said before.... This rapes your mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, sorry if i rambled to much. I end up getting distracted easily and have a problem putting my thought to words, and my words to paper.

    Tsubasa: Tokyo Revelations was pretty special at times, it had the kind of CLAMP magic that you see in various other media by them, such as Magic Knight Rayearth, Cardcaptor Sakura, or even Code Geass. <br />
<br />
The kind of annoying thing is it has this spark of imagination that is so often underpowered because it ends up being poured into a conventional kind of gooey cheesy romance. <br />
<br />
Moreover, there is a grating sense of disconnectedness fueled by the anime&#039;s bizzare relationship to the previous anime, the manga itself, and events in the future, as well as current events, which all do not ever really feel that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186796">
        they are all heading totally in the same direction. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a mixed experience for me, and this sounds like it almost wasn&#039;t worth watching, so I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if other people felt the same. In other words, but anytime CLAMP does anything I think it is something unique and interesting, but all the possibilities drown beneath so many other wild and erratic things it becomes difficult to stand firmly by it. <br />
<br />
CLAMP will always have this weird special thing with magic or honesty or something that tends to raise an interest or catch your attention, but outside of maybe Cardcaptor Sakura it never really felt like it coalesced into a formidable current (and maybe not even Cardcaptor)<br />
<br />
A 6 seems appropriate. <br />

Pretty much sums up Tokyo Revelations in a sentence, A few minutes in it shows a pile of corpses riddled with arrows and lots of blood stained clothes and Syaoran gets shot through the leg with an arrow. Which is quite a culture shock from the rest of the anime which I don&#039;t recall there being any blood in. It&#039;s like watching Sesame Street and all of a sudden Big Bird murders everyone and steals their clothes, It&#039;s not a gradual transition it changes from family friendly adventure to Macbeth.<br />
<br />
Though I did like the darker tone I felt as if it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review69127">
        should of been brought in a lot earlier in the 52 episodes prior rather than just &#039; bam here is the story you were looking for and lots of blood for good measure.&#039;<br />
<br />
The story is quite obviously rushed and makes little sense and doesn&#039;t flow with the rest of the anime&#039;s themes or slow pacing. But I enjoyed these 3 OVA episodes more than I did the 52 episodes before it, Tokyo Revelations kept me glued to the screen which I was not with the two seasons before, though this could be due to having no clue what was going on but I enjoyed the ride anyway.<br />
<br />
Tokyo Revelations art improves greatly on the fight scenes and general movements, they&#039;re a lot smoother and are higher quality compared to the two seasons before which were not bad either but is also a welcome change.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack in Tsubasa Chronicle as whole is fantastic but in Tokyo Revelations it is fitting as well, with the previous seasons consisting of mainly filler the epic soundtrack seemed out of place but with the amount of action and suspenseful scenes in Tokyo Revelations it complements the anime well and creates a epic atmosphere which was lacking in season 2.<br />
<br />
Personally speaking due to the drastic change in the atmosphere and story, the characters are not as developed and the characters feel two dimensional. Fai and Kurogane&#039;s characters fade rapidly it felt as if they were to a deadline to change personality for the next episode. All the characters they meet in Tokyo are unsubstantial due to there only being three episodes they&#039;re unable to develop the new characters more. Sakura and Syaoran change so much that they&#039;re not the same characters, Syaoran has an excuse but not Sakura who decides to throw out the years of being useless and be really nifty with a gun.<br />
<br />
(Trying my best to avoid spoilers)<br />
<br />
Syaoran&#039;s character is thrown to the wind by the rest of the characters despite them knowing the situation they appear to have no attachment to him, despite what happens I would think that as his friends you would try to find a solution. I didn&#039;t care for the new Syaoran, again there not being enough time to develop his character.<br />
<br />
Compared to the rest of the series this had my eyes glued to the screen rather than picking my nails waiting for the story to come into play, it was very hard to follow at times I found myself reading Wikipedia after each episode to make sure I got what happened right.<br />
<br />
Overall I would say it&#039;s a welcome change to the series but due to it&#039;s short length the story is disjointed and confusing. The characters are not as well developed and the character developments are rushed to fit to the three episode limit, all of these changes should have come into play earlier in the series and cut down the three episode bus journey. I would recommend you to read the manga first to get the story which the OVA doesn&#039;t get chance to explain. It forms together quite well despite the short limit ,they have done better with three episodes than they did with 52 to play with. If you can manage to get through the 52 filler fantastic before it is a good reward.<br />

    As a fan Tsubasa, this was a little too irresistible to keep from picking up. I was pretty happy in the end. If you haven&#039;t watched Tsubasa before, or if you don&#039;t know much about it (even just having seen the first season), I strongly recommend you don&#039;t watch this. There would be very little sense to it, and a lot of piecing together scraps of information.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;ve decided you&#039;ve seen, or even read, enough Tsubasa, go ahead and keep reading. <br />
<br />
The quality of the art is the same as always. While it bothers a few of my friends, I&#039;ve always gone head over heels

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37341">
        for Clamp&#039;s art. I love the lanky, there&#039;s-no-way-we&#039;re-really-human look of their characters. And the anime&#039;s company, Kodansha, I feel is particularly remarkable at making a sharp, clean image. Combine the two together, and you have a wonderfully fluid, vivid piece of art, which very well suits Tsubasa&#039;s magical elements, and it&#039;s swinging mood. One moment it&#039;s fun and light, the other it can be dark and &quot;dreary&quot; but the artwork never fails to keep up with the pace. <br />
<br />
Every song but the opening I recognized from the TV anime. While it may have been fun to hear a changed soundtrack, I have always been impressed with the music, so no harm done. Tokyo Revelations did better at keeping it less drawn forward however, which was much appreciated. I find in the anime, the soundtrack can be very overpowering, but I&#039;m not here to talk about that Tsubasa. So here&#039;s more about this one: <br />
<br />
While being as short as it was (it&#039;s an OVA after all), I was satisfied with how everything played out. In the three normal length episodes here, I felt like I was watching six or seven had it been in the normal season. So much happened, there&#039;s just no way it could have all fit so neatly, but I like being proved wrong, so there&#039;s a happy ending with this review.<br />
<br />
Overall, I was very satisfied. Tokyo Revelations is very true to what Tsubasa is and has been. There&#039;s a turn at most corners presented in the OVA, the art, music, and characters are all familiar and unaltered. It&#039;s what I wish OVA&#039;s would be, but tend not to be. Good job, Tokyo Revelations. You&#039;ve done well.<br />
<br />

    How can something so simple become so complicated? This will be my first thought while watching Tokyo Revelations...<br />
<br />
Main Characters: Sakura, Syaoran, Fai, Kurogane and Mokona<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve finished the 1st and 2nd seasons of TC a very long time ago so it took me a while to recall and to catch up with what the heck is going on here...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 7/10 <br />
<br />
Why? There was too much drama... I cannot even decide if this is an X OVA or a Tsubasa Chronicles OVA... it was quite original, yes... since characters from Clamp were shown in every possible way... kinda makes you feel nostalgic but it sometimes steers

          <span style="display: none;" id="review41185">
        off course... too many characters, too many unnecessary info...<br />
<br />
Overall - 8/10<br />
<br />
It&#039;s an 8 since everything came into place already... it was now explained why there were 2 Syaorans and why they were &quot;forced&quot; to travel from one world to another... story-wise this could have been done in 24eps... but i guess having just a few episodes might defeat the purpose of Sakura getting those &quot;experience points&quot;...<br />
<br />
Music was beautiful... BG had a chant-like feel to it... i&#039;ve always loved the music in TC... OP/ED were hauntingly catchy...<br />
<br />
My fave of the bunch will be in this order: Mokona, Fai, Kurogane, Syaoran then Sakura... Mokona had more personality than the female lead, who happens to be asleep 75% of the time... Fai, with his smiling face is still a mystery to me... Kurogane is a softy... Syaoran had good fighting scenes... Sakura - hmmm... i&#039;m not really a fan of those damsels-in-distress-but-tries-hard-to-help... but i guess she&#039;s okay... never did watch the Cardcaptor series...<br />
<br />
This would be recommended to people who adore the Clamp world since there would always be a little extra for the fans... To those who have time to watch the 57eps of this anime, (26+26+3+2), I suggest to get all since watching the entire thing will definitely make a difference... :)<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s hoping I can get my hands on the last one... *dang it*<br />
<br />

    In my mind, the animation was better than in the first seasons. I have to admit, that some scenes were unfortunately not able to keep up with the rest (third OVA: Fay looked like a fish desperately longing for air O.o). Nonetheless the storyline was very interesting and not so easy to understand, which I find very exciting.<br />
All in all &amp;quot;Tsubasa Chronicles - Tokyo Revelation&amp;quot; is something, fans should watch while keeping the manga in mind, in which the emotion and drama is portrayed much more intensively. =)  <br />

    *CLAP CLAP CLAP, Tsubasa Tokyo Revelations (TTR) Is a masterpiece, this OVA is Dark, mysterious, fucking amazing and something that makes your mind gone insane for some events, fucking events. . . <br />
<br />
***Guys, i was trying to not spoil for those who will read this but. . .  ALAS! It&#039;s verrry hard<br />
<br />
<br />
Story : it was based of the animation of the MAJOR PLOT TWIST of The whole manga, so hands down for making it go near to the manga itself. The writing style is GREAT<br />
<br />
animation : hands down to the animation so awesome, TTR&#039;s animation literally knocked down the animation of the anime itself,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149521">
        flawless events, fighting scenes are great, fucking awesome changing music, looks like they take a lot of effort for this OVA, hands down <br />
<br />
Characters : ahem. . . . If you are a Fai Flourite fan, i would like to say that you need to prepare for his Fate, FUCKING CHANGING CHARACTER&#039;S ATTITUDE, i wasn&#039;t prepared for this series and it makes me gone wild like touching the screen and goes like &quot;FAAIIIIII. . . NOOOOO. . . &quot;  but i&#039;m going to list it as characters<br />
<br />
-Sakura : if she didn&#039;t interrupt the fight, we will witness the MOST. EPIC. FIGHTING . SCENE. EVER. so i was like &quot;WHY SAKURA WHY?&quot;. But after that events, it seems that she developed a quite little, for me. <br />
<br />
-Syaoran : anyway i hate syaoran here, not because of what did he do to my Precious Fai, but because he was blocked by his confidence, his confidence is very annoying at this OVA and it was obviously that he was under spell or not true, that&#039;s a quite predictable<br />
<br />
-Fai : well well well, our little wizard here goes wild, he was so mysterious at first, and it was the sign that there&#039;s really something happens, predictable but i have no idea what is it until the events itself, he was wise here but his curiosity is the reason why he almost reach the end of the cliff of life. if he didn&#039;t jump to the water, maybe he&#039;ll not lose his Precious eye, TO BE HONEST but i like his character change here, this is not a Fan Talk even i&#039;m his fan for a long time<br />
<br />
-kurogane : he is much wiser than the series itself, he was developing at this OVA, yep yep yep, but it seems that he improve a little, and grow a bond to &quot;him&quot; , often he sacrifice just for &quot;him&quot; and his life<br />
<br />
-Mokona : soo annoying, our mokona here is sooo annoying i don&#039;t know why but i felt here that mokona is useless in this series, no offense . . . . .  Closed<br />
<br />
Character&#039;s voice : i&#039;ve never expect that Takayama Minami - sensei would appear at this series, i&#039;ve been a fan of her, so no doubt that i recognize two of characters there are voiced my Takayama Minami. I also notice that Daisuke Namikawa give us a Sexy Fai voice (especially the KuroFai scene there). <br />
<br />
Soundtrack : Synchronicity is a masterpiece, i was kinda meh because Sakura&#039;s seiyuu (Makino Yui) voice at the verse parts didn&#039;t fit to the instrumental but it was back at the chorus (chorus at this song is very amazing)<br />
saigo no Kajitsu is a song of feels, i was kinda &quot;right in the kokoro&quot; when i&#039;m listening that song, looks like a heart broken Sakura is singing the saigo no kajitsu in Maaya Sakamoto Voice<br />
<br />
soundtrack (The music itself in the story) : GOOD JOB KAJIURA YUKI FOR THE MASTERPIECE *clap clap clap* flawless music high definition sounds, GOOD JOB<br />
<br />
Effects (CGI in the animation itself) : HANDS DOWN, CGI here is updated, GOOD JOB<br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL : TTR is a very good OVA, if you want to mindfuck and shock after watching the series, then go watch this, i found sakura a bit annoying here, sleeping for a long time but wrong timing for waking up (FUCK why she doesn&#039;t have an alarm clock for it XD). our three boys here are facing a new fate for each of them, hands down to animation, hands down to sound, the characters too, TRULY A MASTERPIECE!

    Finally, it is here! The anime adaptation of Tsubasa Chronicle where the first huge revelations of the main plot unfolded.<br />
<br />
There’s a long review coming…….<br />
<br />
About the STORY<br />
From the title itself, this OVA focuses with some of the important revelations from the original story. When the previous seasons were more on introduction and the adventure part of the story, this sequel was way even greater. In season one and two, there were very few hints about the main plot but not enough to have a clear understanding of the amazing plots of the story. This time, though not all are being revealed, it was the first huge

          <span style="display: none;" id="review79650">
        confirmations and revelations of what were really happening to the storyline of the series. When in previous seasons it was more fun because of the adventures, this time the drama that comes with the revelations made the series a lot gloomier and darker. Still, the excitement that comes with all the revelations was just too much. It was beyond being amazing.<br />
<br />
About the CHARACTERS<br />
Of course, with the pain that comes with the revelations, makes the characters in a shock stage. It even made little distances from each other. However, I strongly believe it will make their bond stronger because knowing the truth about your companions will surely make you understand them more and so will make you closer to them. The situation made all the main characters changed, either for the better or made them put even more distance from one another. Fai became a lot more serious because he was afraid that he might be too close already that he might hurt them with their involvement with him. And so he became more secretive. Sakura, on the other hand, after learning the gravity of the situation became stronger when it comes to making her own decisions and resolves. Syaoran, obviously was the source of the biggest revelations. But even though, he might not be the one the main characters went to traveling, he was still the same compassionate and so very kind Syaoran considering he was the original. I guess, Kurogane was the only one who has not changed for the obvious reason that he was the only one among the main characters who was honest with others when it comes to his identity. Kurogane’s strong-willed, kind-hearted, and honest attitude was the only thing that makes the bond of the group intact despite the confusion because of the revelations. I also love how almost all the characters of X were gathered in this sequel.<br />
<br />
About the ANIMATION<br />
I believe the animation was way more amazing compared to the previous ones. In fact, it was one of the best as of today. It was not very different from the previous ones but you can still feel the evidence of being polish. The illustrations and the artworks were just magnificent. It was almost like watching a Hollywood anime motion picture.<br />
<br />
Of course, I’ve already read the manga form but considering I am such a visual person and preferred seeing them in anime form, indeed I a am having a blast watching this Ovas. I actually had goose bumps watching it. Every revelation was just so heart rate-raising and breath-taking. Until now, I am still having hard time comprehending how CLAMP was able to create such brilliant creation. I am dying to see more anime adaptation of this series.<br />

    Tsubasa Chronicles: Tokyo Revelations, the continue of one of my absolute FAVOURITE animes of all time. It&#039;s also where CLAMP unleashes a &quot;mind-blowing&quot; plot that kicks you in the ass, saying to watch it over and over again.<br />
<br />
Story: (10/10)<br />
From the masters of CLAMP, this moved at a slow, but &quot;musical&quot; and beautiful rate. From the OVA however, CLAMP&#039;s mind blowing plot came, shocking everyone. It&#039;s unmatched story plot, simply unmatched.<br />
<br />
Art: (10/10)<br />
Beautiful art, which is entirely copied from the manga. As expected from CLAMP.<br />
<br />
Sound: (9/10)<br />
Very unique songs which fit scenes almost flawlessly. They really do play with your emotions, and get you &quot;hyped&quot; up!<br />
<br />
Character: (10/10)<br />
Characters are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17750">
        rather unique, and can change depending on the arising situations. Starting out simple, and ending complex.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (10/10)<br />
I really love the scenes. They are really diverse, and not random at all.<br />
I especially love Mokona, that fuzzy little creature which loves to mess with people :)<br />
<br />
Overall: (10/10)<br />
It&#039;s a masterpiece, not perfect, but a complete masterpiece. There&#039;s no arguing the fact of the brilliance in these ova episodes. Packed with complete content, so you don&#039;t need to worry about pointless scenes which are similar to fillers ^-^

    Tokyo Revelations made the two whole season of an already fantastic show seem childish. The story is darker, bloodier and fight scenes even better. Sakura even seemed to have matured and is getting a bit more independent also the four main characters bonds seem to be even deeper than before.<br />
<br />
In my opinion Superb!! Plus the crossover characters were an added bonus!
