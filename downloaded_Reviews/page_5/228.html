    Diamond no Ace, a name that might not be heard as frequently as other largely popular sports shows out there. And that has always dumbfounded me. A show doing everything right, also up there as one of the best in its genre, yet still never has broke through the locks and that is evident with the relatively small amount of members it has on MAL compared to other popular sport shows.<br />
<br />
A collaboration of Madhouse and Production I.G., two of arguably the greatest ever studio&#039;s in this industry. With loads of experience behind them and even highly in the sports genre (Madhouse: Hajime no Ippo, One

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214514">
        Outs and Chihayafuru. Production I.G.: Haikyuu!!, Kuroko no Basket and Prince of Tennis) coming together for the first time. And it was a long runner at that, so you could always expect them to deliver the goods. This will be a combined review of both the seasons, and also may contain spoilers. <br />
<br />
After having agonizingly lost in the finals against Inashiro a year ago and missing out on an opportunity to play at the National level, it was no other way but to try again for the highly lauded Seido High School of Baseball. And with many of the acclaimed senior players retiring from the team, things looked bleak for Seido. With new freshmen joining the team, it was always hard to build back the team and try to challenge other clubs.<br />
 <br />
The characters as players also go through quite a lot development as they try to ramp up their game and take experience from the matches they play. Although Sawamura (aka Bakamura :p) remains the same idiot as ever, he actually does show what he&#039;s capable of and gets close to Furuya to become Seido&#039;s ace, and that inner battle between the two pitchers was amazing to see as always in the show. Miyuki Kazuya is the new captain of this refreshed Seido side, and we&#039;re treated to his super abilities as a captain and a catcher. He&#039;s the pillar of Seido which keeps the team intact. Quite a few of rivals and players have stepped up their game too, and we see a new rival for Seido in Yakushi with Raichi the monster-slogger and the cunning Sanada Shunpei, coming to the scene being better than before.<br />
<br />
The music for DnA too has never seized to amaze me. One after the other, DnA boasts of exciting new OP and ED songs. It also has a great set of OST&#039;s and Background Music that totally ignites the fiery and tense moments in a game. Good consistent voice acting all around, too. The animation is convincing for the fifty one episodes. They&#039;ve stuck to the basics with little exaggerated movements and it doesn&#039;t have any sort of flashy moves or any otherworldly techniques that would be impossible to execute in a real match. The better players realize the situations and play accordingly, occasionally taking inspirations from what their coaches or fellow players might&#039;ve said in the past. So DnA has had that realistic appeal all the time, something that makes this show all the more enjoyable. It&#039;s one of the best long-running sport anime there is. The enjoyment is worthwhile for the huge amount of episodes.<br />
<br />
DnA is a very simple show. We follow the dream of aspiring young baseball players and a club to play in the Nationals. It&#039;s a roller-coaster ride filled with endless excitement and emotions. <br />

    This was my first venture into the baseball sports anime genre. I have never watched a single baseball game in my life and was never intrested in one until I watched Diamond no Ace. I expected it to some boring anime of a team trying to play baseball as hard as they can. But sometime after that Diamond no Ace was approved for 52 episodes for its first season and the it was being produced by Madhouse. So I thought i would give it a try and to my surprise Diamond no Ace is now one of my all-time favourite shows.<br />
<br />
Story: 10 - Diamond no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204133">
        Ace is without a doubt the best Sports-Baseball anime ever. Diamond no Ace : Second Season is the continuation of Seidou&#039;s journey to win the Koushien. It also shows the path of Sawamura Eijun to become the ace and the best pitcher in all of japan.But the show provides us more than just following Sawamura&#039;s journey; we basically get an overall glimpse of how high school baseball in Japan. This show has taken time to progress , and over the 109 episodes (Season 1 - 75 ep , Season 2 - 34 ep) we have seen the development of Sawamura and Seidou over the time. <br />
<br />
And one thing that I love about Diamond no Ace is the SUSPENCE. The DnA knows hows to build up suspense leading up to the final scene in every episode..<br />
<br />
Art: 8 - The art is great. It is difficult to not like it. Overall, I have no complaints about the art , the only reason I did not give a higher rating is because I have seen more unique and well-made art-styles among the animes I watched so I the outcome was a 8/10 as you see.<br />
<br />
The baseball-playing scenes are very well-done especially some of the pitches which are animated showing clear movement of the ball (slow-mo shots of how the ball moves, or a clear arrow-like streak of light to see the course of the ball). Especially Sawamura&#039;s unique pitching form is well done. I never tire of seeing it. In later episodes, we also get to see how genius of a catcher Miyuki is with a few amazing saves.<br />
<br />
Because comedy is a big part of this show, sometimes we&#039;ll see chibi forms pop out now and then, or sudden solid-colored background changes (with sfx and the like) when the mood switches suddenly from serious to funny.<br />
<br />
Overall, the animation gives off a very shounen-like vibe: we get to see red-colored and blue-colored demon eyes for when they&#039;re fired up, players aura engulfing their bodies like a flame when they&#039;re pumped up, etc.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10 -  It is just the best. Madhouse has fitted every scene with the right and most fitting sound effects. Specially in the BGM, I found that madhouse has done a really great job of mixing the sound with each moment and situation. I could feel the intensity and suspense of the game from the screen. Also, I&#039;d like to include that the voice actors has a done a great job of voice acting. their voices fits the characters almost perfectly.<br />
<br />
As for the OP &amp; ED, I loved the OP  HEROES&quot; by Glay (frm eps 4-26) and ED &quot;KIMERO!!&quot; by OxT (frm eps 4-13) and  &quot;BLUE WINDING ROAD&quot;  which was great to hear and for sometime it had me humming and singing.<br />
<br />
Character: 10 - All of them are great. But only 4 cast including the main character is the most eye catching of them all. Believe me, the supporting characters are not inferior. Just that these 4 characters shine more brightly than others.<br />
<br />
Sawamura is the loud, cheerful, wears his heart on his sleeve kind of guy. So what kind of quirk does he have that makes him the Main Character? He&#039;s a southpaw (left-handed) pitcher and has a peculiar pitch (both of which make him a unique type of player). But, even though he&#039;s unique he isn&#039;t the type of MC that&#039;s super-talented right from the start, he doesn&#039;t suddenly &quot;power up&quot; in the middle of a game, is unstoppable and wins all the matches; on the contrary, he gets into Seidou and quickly realises it&#039;s not as easy as he thought to become the ace because there are other people there who are more skilled than him. He falters during important moments, and even if he doesn&#039;t get back up immediately, he does eventually pick himself up and learns to move on. In other words, he accepts that he has a lot of faults, and this is what makes him so likeable and seem more human. Though a bit of an idiot (well, a big idiot), he works hard, values friendship, supports the team and always puts 120% in everything that he does. And the best part for me, he&#039;s unpredictable. Just when you think he&#039;s turning the corner and well on his way to becoming the ace, he messes up a play or does something really silly. I&#039;m always on edge with him.<br />
<br />
Miyuki, the genius catcher, is personality-wise, almost the exact opposite of Sawamura, except for the cheerful part. He&#039;s as crafty and intelligent as they come and though on the outside he&#039;s always smiling, he has a bit of a dark side. He&#039;s like the evil genius.<br />
<br />
Furuya is our Main Character&#039;s rival for the ace spot. At first glance, he looks like the cool and collected type of person, also; but after a while I found him to be an adorable idiot as well: not being able to catch a simple throw and his insta-snooze reaction amongst others.<br />
<br />
Last but not least of our main cast quartet, is Haruichi. Character-design wise, he&#039;s the cutest one. Specially love his new haircut. And though he might be cute, he&#039;s one amazing baseball player: not only is he a batting prodigy, but an exceptional fielder as well. At the same time, he&#039;s so humble and shy. Cuteness overload!<br />
<br />
And then we have the other Seidou members, who all play an important role in the show. All have distinctive and quirky personalties and you will grow attached to at least one after watching Diamond no Ace.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9 - So far I have been watching Diamond no Ace every week  from Season 1. Whenever I&#039;m watch it can always expect a good dose of humour interlaced with the appropriate amount of emotional moments and also a killer cliff-hanger. And what Diamond no Ace has no fillers and each episode is filled with action or drama.<br />
<br />
Also, the funny moments are funny, they never ruin the atmosphere, they actually make it more interesting.And what makes it more enjoyable, is the details about the training, and how every character has a specialty, and even though they support each other, they&#039;re rivals as well.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10 -  Diamond no Ace is a great anime I recommend if you like to explore new genres or if you like anime like Haikyuu , Kuroko no Baske , Prince of Tennis and ... in other words fo sports anime fans. I&#039;d say this is amust watch.

    No spoilers...<br />
<br />
You&#039;re probably thinking of an 7/10 a bit of a low rating, but I&#039;m taking in the account of 5/10 being an average. That, I consider an exceptional score. I also currently follow MLB (Major League Baseball) and used to play baseball. I just want you to keep all that in mind.<br />
<br />
I first thought the 2nd season will be like the 1st season, this was going to be a long drag and have a pretty cliche/predictable story. This is considering having to go through the previous season’s 75 episodes, but still enjoyed it enough for the nostalgia and epic moments.<br />
<br />
Boy, I was so wrong.<br />
<br />
For

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215472">
        sports anime, there always the main team&#039;s goal to win nationals or blah blah blah, win the tournament. However, for this one, that wasn&#039;t really solely that goal. I can&#039;t give away anything (cuz spoilers), but this gives a twist to the series I wasn&#039;t totally expecting. Still, generally a sport anime story though...<br />
<br />
What really makes this a great sport anime is the characters. There are so many character that I can’t even keep up. Each character has some kind of unique quirk, style, backstory, or even the way they&#039;re drawn is what makes them stand out. This certainly the case for Sawamura and new characters to follow. Many aren’t really one dimensional.<br />
<br />
The art direction is still solid, but not amazing. What really brought this score down was the art. There wasn’t really improvement since the previous season. I don’t mean the art was bad to begin with, but a lot of the characters are drawn inconsistently and the background NPCs are even worse. The backgrounds are sometimes inconsistent too. But the little details like the strings on the fielding gloves and the designs on the batting gloves are a plus.<br />
<br />
As for the sound, the OST is still amazing as in the first season and the openings/endings are just as good as well. Sound effects are nice too.<br />
<br />
This was also prominent in the 1st season as well. I’ve been hearing complaints of during the 2nd season of: “Oh is this Furuya no Ace?” or “When will Sawamura have the spotlight?” It seems some people don’t really understand why this is necessary. Although it is painstaking that Sawamura doesn’t really get to show his stuff and Furuya still butts in, this helps the MC develop. Without Furuya, Sawamura wouldn’t have a burning passion he does right now. Furuya completes Sawamura. Please don’t be like those butthurt fans. I just want you to keep that in mind into the 2nd season from the 1st.<br />
<br />
Overall, I really enjoyed the 2nd season, well worth going through the 1st. Oh don’t forget the dreadful cliffhangers! ;)

    This is my first time to write a review because I truly think that this anime deserves way more praise than it currently receives. In my circle of friends, I&#039;m the only one who watched this anime because of the fact that the sport featured in this anime - baseball, is boring. But don&#039;t let that stop you since you&#039;d be missing out on one of the best sports anime out there.<br />
<br />
Story (10/10)<br />
I give it a 10 because somehow, the story still grips me even if it does follow the same formula of the 1st season. (get the team to be stronger to get to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213812">
        Koshien... yada yada) Aside from this, the addition of new characters adds more spice to the story which continued from season 1. One of the notable additions would be Coach Ochiai. (not gonna say anything more to keep this spoiler-free)<br />
<br />
Another notable feature about this anime is its cliffhangers. There are quite a lot of episodes in this season which led to a lot of cliffhangers and I love it! The episodes where the main protagonist - Eijun Sawamura gets to pitch really puts the hype through the roof! Those scenes are intense, and this anime really changed my view on baseball. <br />
<br />
In the 1st season, I must admit that the last few episodes were a bit dragging, but in this season, after watching 50 out of 51 episodes, I must say that all the episodes near the end were pretty frigging hype.<br />
<br />
Art (10/10)<br />
I could find nothing wrong with the art style of this anime. It&#039;s easy on the eyes and I like it. :) Another thing I like about this anime is that the character designs are somewhat realistic - you wouldn&#039;t find a player with green hair or orange hair out of the blue. (with an exception for the Kominato brothers) This gives the anime a grounded feeling.<br />
<br />
Sound (10/10)<br />
The hype in this anime is even tripled with this anime&#039;s sounds. The opening and ending songs are not bad either.<br />
<br />
Character (10/10)<br />
It&#039;s the 2nd season, and naturally the seniors of the team had to graduate from the team. I thought that it would lessen my love for this anime since I loved the senior characters from the 1st season, but to my surprise, it really didn&#039;t! The new characters added to the team really added more spice to the story, and we get to see Miyuki, Maezono, and Kuramochi really step it up to become the new seniors of the team. Those 3 had a lot of character development in this season. Aside from this, more first years have been added to the team, and they&#039;re all so likable that it&#039;s easy to care about them with just a few episodes. <br />
<br />
And of course we&#039;ve also got Eijun Sawamura who&#039;s still an idiot - but really developed into a reliable, well-pitching idiot this season. :)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10)<br />
If you have not already noticed then I&#039;ll say it: I REAAAALLLY ENJOYED THIS ANIME. &lt;3<br />
<br />
Overall (10/10)<br />
Go watch it now. It would be worth it.<br />

    I was quite excited to find that Diamond no Ace was getting a second season basically straight after it finished. Although the first few episodes were recaps, I found this sequel on-par with, or maybe even better than, the first season.<br />
<br />
Story: <br />
Just like the prequel, the story is nothing too unique. However, it is good to see competition between the main character and his rival, as they are on the same team. One of the things I like the most about sports anime is watching the players improve, this show certainly boasts this quality because the MC is far from perfect and neither is the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205658">
        rest of the team since the upperclassmen have left. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art was generally clean and simple. The colours used during the games were good for surprises or shocks and really showed the emotions of the characters (focus/concentration, anger, fear, etc.).<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
I really do like the music. The opening and ending themes were catchy and suit the animations. The background music was good for building up the suspense.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
It was great to see how realistic the characters were. Nobody was overly OP, even if there was a really strong character you would get a view of their backstory, showing you just how much effort and practice was put in to make them so powerful.<br />
<br />
The main characters each have different personalities, points of view and goals. I will not go too deep into each of the characters as they are mostly explained in the first season.<br />
<br />
I really liked the fact that the others teams all got their spotlight as well, and even afterwards they weren&#039;t tossed aside because they had done their part in the story. The side characters certainly weren&#039;t unimportant and very quite likeable (though some of them had forgettable faces).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I really did enjoy this anime. Maybe even more than the first season. Every week I wait impatiently for a new episode to come out, which really does add to the tension the anime gives at the end of every episode. Although strategy talk may bore some, the games played are quite exciting to watch (however it is sometimes annoying when a character you like doesn&#039;t get much screentime).<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Definitely a must-watch in the sports anime genre with many ups and downs, a decent sense of humour and great fun in itself.

    Holy hot damn, this anime just keeps surprising me. I&#039;ll tell you what, the end of this season had me so stressed that my heart was beating as though I&#039;d just run the mile. I&#039;m gonna try to keep this review short because my review of the first season was pretty through in explaining why this anime is so good, but I&#039;m gonna hit some of the points that got better for me this season or things I noticed more.<br />
<br />
This go around, I was really able to appreciate how the music was working to further the plot. I don&#039;t believe the main pieces were changed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324268">
        too much, but they were used just as well. You can perfectly understand what&#039;s going on in the story just through the music, and that&#039;s really special. It&#039;s even better when the plot follows suit and then completely switches gears immediately after. The sound design did really well to draw the viewer into the moment and then kick them out just as quickly. When the music stopped, you knew something was up, even if the plot hadn&#039;t revealed it yet. It&#039;s so well done.<br />
<br />
Since I&#039;m bringing up the plot, I wanna talk about the story. I was serious about my heart racing like that of an athlete in the middle of a match. The first season did well with tension, too, but this season stepped it up for sure. You absolutely cannot know what&#039;s going to happen. Even if you guess correctly, the plot is gonna make you second-guess it over and over. The result of the story using tension so well is that the successes and failures hit that much harder. It&#039;s able to make you hope, and then it either rewards it or snatches it way in the most technically amazing way possible. Something unexpected always happens, and the story becomes so phenomenal because of that.<br />
<br />
This series also takes brilliant care of its characters and their development. It&#039;s something I have difficulty describing while still keeping it vague, but any time a character gets a chance to grow, you really feel like you&#039;re taking every step with them. Whether they&#039;re good steps, bad steps, or something in between, nothing is written lazily. This anime has made me connect with certain characters more than any other anime in this genre. Since the writing takes the care to develop the characters slowly and realistically within the parameters they&#039;ve set for realism in the anime, it makes them a lot easier to sympathize with and love.<br />

I can&#039;t praise this anime enough. I&#039;m never gonna be able to stop praising it, and I&#039;m glad I get to have all these new experiences because of the quality of it all. I&#039;m sad that it may end soon, but it&#039;s something I&#039;d never give up because... I&#039;m having so much fun. I guess I&#039;m off to burn more calories through stressful watch-time, so I&#039;ll see you at the end of the next one.<br />

    Starting this series was an impulsive decision, but I don’t regret it. Even though I’ve never watched a real baseball game and the sport is non-existent in my country, I quickly grew to like it.<br />
<br />
*Contains NO spoilers*<br />
<br />
Characters - 8/10<br />
Its dynamic characters are Diamond no Ace’s (DnA) strong suit. They&#039;re all unique - in character design, personality, and purpose. I fell in love with most of them from the first season and that didn&#039;t change during this one. The plot makes you admire the players&#039; efforts and camaraderie. <br />
<br />
The start of this season was bittersweet for me because the Third Years (who I loved and named

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214668">
        my cats after) left. Was I worried that DnA: Second Season wouldn&#039;t be able to fill the resulting hole in my heart? Yes. Did it compensate for the loss by doing something that I&#039;ve always wanted this show to do? Yes! They finally upped the focus on the non-First-String players this season. With our favorite seniors gone, these guys had big shoes to fill and the opportunity to make their senpais and coach proud. Even if they didn&#039;t make the team, some characters still contributed significantly to it (in ways I won&#039;t spoil). <br />
<br />
DnA has a huge cast, so its focus on side characters during the first season was refreshing. Sometimes, after learning the stories of opposing teams and their players, I wasn&#039;t sure who I wanted to win a match. I also loved that each coach had an adorable quirk. This time around, some side characters just felt like cardboard. They could have done much more with Raichi in particular, who spent 65% of his screen time laughing asininely. We didn&#039;t need to see so much of the pair of journalists covering the games either.  <br />
<br />
Art - 7/10<br />
The animation was pretty good. My only qualms are that some scenes could have been done more fluidly with fewer (loooong) freeze frames and split panels to make parts of the game more exciting. DnA gets it right at key points during gameplay but not consistently throughout it. Even when the more artsy route is explored (for example: adding auras or other elements to a character/scene at crucial parts in the game), it fails to be compelling. The series makes up for it in the more humorous scenes featuring chibi forms of characters, though, and the result is HILARIOUS and cute!<br />
<br />
Sound - 5/10<br />
The sounds effects were lacking. Some sounds were overused (constantly reused), which made hearing them more of a nuisance than something that improved the atmosphere of a scene. I grew tired of the random &quot;ping&quot; that they used during tense scenes, split frames, or when a ball was hit. Plus, hearing that ONE track introduced whenever the game picked up (if you watched season 1, you know what I&#039;m talking about) frustrated me. The soundtrack needed more diversity. I would have also appreciated hearing a common cheer that I could chant along with the team/crowd, like the crowd does in Haikyuu!!. <br />
<br />
Now for the good: the opening and ending themes were great. Never skip them. ^_^  <br />
<br />
Story - 9/10<br />
The story&#039;s pretty straightforward. A baseball team that missed out on nationals in the previous season tries again to achieve their ultimate goal. But the journey to nationals isn&#039;t as straightforward. You&#039;ll enjoy seeing the team members and coach develop throughout the season. Why? Because of the support they afford each other and the challenges that certain opponents pose. This is not the story of an overpowered MC. It&#039;s an authentic tale about the benefits of healthy rivalry, tenacity, and teamwork. <br />
<br />
As a total novice to baseball, I appreciated how explanations of pitches and plays (basically of anything baseball) were seamlessly incorporated into the storyline. My only issue is with the directing; the pacing was horrible sometimes. Some games were far too long, and the LITTLE plot development accomplished in one episode would annoy you. For me, that dulled the excitement.<br />
<br />
Overall - 7/10<br />
Watch it: It&#039;s a good anime that you&#039;ll learn worthwhile lessons from. Some lines make great inspirational quotes. For example:<br />
<br />
&quot;Doing the same boring thing over and over every day will surprisingly give you strength when it really matters. I want to live an easier life...but...life doesn&#039;t work that way.&quot;

    The 2nd season for Diamond no Ace keeps the hope of winning a ticket to national tournament alive!<br />
<br />
Story: Like almost every sport anime I have seen the goal is very simple indeed. (Baby Steps, Prince of Tennis) Still the story keeps surprising by different factors which are common in real life, not everything can go as planned. This is exactly why Diamond no Ace gives this refreshing &quot;slice-off&quot; life feeling. Even though the story isn&#039;t that awesome, they manage to perform so well. Main protagonists are pitcher Sawamura Eijun, Furuya Satoru and catcher Miyuki Kazuya, but because of this is about baseball a team sport

          <span style="display: none;" id="review219354">
        we will also watch how other players will grow as a players. Story pacing is very good, individual elements like slice of life amazing! Especially the moments where pitcher was about to pitch felt thrilling. Ending was satisfying and almost just almost got tear. <br />
<br />
7/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Art:  Art is pretty memorable, but nothing &quot;overly&quot; unique. Animation is fluid through the whole series. Character design is well done and my favorite is Miyuki Kazuya. Best animations were in action scenes so pitching and batting were intense, well described and overall good. Background animations and so on weren&#039;t impressive quite dull, but at least they managed to do the most important thing right!<br />
<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
Sound: Characters voice actors were very fitting and I liked a lot of Kataoka Tesshin voice. Background music was the most amazing of all sounds. They enhanced feelings like fear, excitement, frustration and the moment when you success and win! My favorite OSTS are Grow Stronger step by step, Grow stronger day by day theme of Sawamura (same kind of as the earlier one) and Climb over Wall. I think they are pretty much the same as in previous season.  (Can&#039;t remember the one they used when batting to intensify the feeling). Openings (2x) are catchy, but I liked the final opening much more. Endings are good but nothing significant.<br />
<br />
10/10<br />
<br />
Characters: Characters are almost well-rounded but for some odd reason there is a trend for little bit &quot;dumb&quot; characters. Fortunately it doesn&#039;t stick out that much that it would disturb. Characters reacted to things realistically  especially in depression, feeling of the loss and victory. Character growth isn&#039;t that versatile but it happens when people want to learn from their mistakes or support their teammates. Sawamura learns to be more confident in his pitches and Furuya learns the responsibility as a pitcher. Characters like Sawamura, Furuya, Miyuki and Haruichi are more fleshed in the series than their teammates. There aren&#039;t any &quot;villains&quot; there are just amazing players who want to win for different reasons. I will remember especially the main characters I said and probably Haruichi and Miyuki better because I liked their design more.<br />
<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
Sport anime can split opinions from one end to other end, but I started watching sport anime with a little hesitation, but pretty open minded. So yes, I think that non-anime fans can enjoy this if they are pretty close to sport overall. Re-watching this series will lower the emotions which were felt because successful and unsuccessful pitches and batting are remembered. This anime is memorable also because I don&#039;t watch that much sport anime but also because I enjoyed a lot considering that it&#039;s belongs to &quot;sport&quot; genre.<br />
<br />
10/10<br />

      Since  you came to read the reviews of the 2nd season i assume you ve already seen the 1st. (if not, well you are a bit of an oddball)<br />
  <br />
  The 2nd season starts off with the defeated team that didn&#039;t manage to go to nationals. At first, it&#039;s rather normal for everyone to be sad about the 3rd years leaving because they were all extremely interesting characters, and it makes you wonder, is the 2nd season gonna be good without them ? Well yes it is! Even though the about to retired 3rd years aren&#039;t at the scene much,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review232521">
        other characters get more scene time and a deeper character development. When watching the new team i wondered &quot;was this guy always here?&quot; but after awhile you cant imagine the season without the new characters. <br />
  This season puts more depth to the players emotions, instead of only polishing flashy moves you get to follow the protagonists mostly mental struggle. Even if you aren&#039;t into sports it makes you understand that not only physical training is important. Even though the main character isn&#039;t the sharpest pen of the shed (and his intelligence doesn&#039;t get any better) you can clearly see the character development in his own aspects. Off-course due to the 3rd years not being there all the characters are forced to grow (along with everyone&#039;s favorite Miyuki who becomes the new captain, a befitting title don&#039;t you think?) Well my personal favorite is Kuramochi and he plays a pretty important role this season!<br />
  I have never watched nor do i plan on watching a real baseball match, yet i loved this anime and i highly recommend it. I think if an anime makes you watch over 100 episodes about a generally not so popular sport and never be bored it&#039;s worth watching.

    S2 of Diamond no Ace isn&#039;t complete yet but I feel like I have watched enough to write a review. Generally, its as good and entertaining as S1. :)<br />
<br />
The S1 cast remain intact but are joined by new teams and also new faces. In S2, some character developments are now more obvious than others, while the rest continue to develop slowly. Again, don&#039;t get frustrated here (especially with the main protagonist and some people surrounding him) because this is a more realistic anime and imo, the development of the characters steadily depend on their &quot;persona&quot; and their &quot;experiences&quot; ( I hope you get my point

          <span style="display: none;" id="review209639">
        here, otherwise, just keep an open mind. :) )<br />
<br />
The matches are as awesome as ever-- smart, unpredictable and engaging -- and sometimes, you might actually find yourself swept away by the audience and cheering for the underdog. The tracks are basically the same and well used, but the OP songs have lesser hype, imo. <br />
<br />
Overall, this is a very enjoyable sequel to watch. :)

    Following this series for two years, left me devastated when I knew my Monday will go on without a new episode of this series.<br />
<br />
Ace of Diamond : Second Season has proven to me the art and meaning of Japanese High School Baseball or kokoyakyu since the story resolved around it. It was the continuation of the first season, when the boys and the new team struggles their way to perform in Koshien that they failed to do during the summer. The main drama of this season is somewhat more personal and we get to see and learn more about the bunch of old and new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215834">
        characters of this series. In this series, we also get to see more of the realistic kokoyakyu side and how &#039;youth&#039; really is portrayed here from the friendship, rivals, worries, improvement, determination and hard work. The story has became more and more interesting. <br />
<br />
You could compare the old art (the 2013 series) with this second season by comparing it side by side and you could told the difference and see the improvement the staff did to this series. I&#039;m not going to lie but yes, they still use same animations for different scenes but they managed to differentiate it and spice it up! It&#039;s nice to see the staff improve the art :)<br />
<br />
To be honest, I prefer the endings more than the openings. Sure GLAY sings well and right on the heart at one point and another, but somehow the endings have something that the openings don&#039;t have. For example, KIMERO! the first ending of the season, that has a very upbeat and full of spirit ending which introduces us to the new &#039;core&#039; characters of the season and shows that both Eijun and the new team has a pretty long way to go but they undergo it with spirit and determination, or Brand New Blue, the last ending, with a slow build melody but then changes into a cheer upbeat, pointing out that Seidou new team is finally in sync and is ready to face the trials and challenges that awaits them. <br />
<br />
The seiyuus also delivered their greatest performance. They mentioned several times that sometimes the studio turned into a somewhat boys locker room or a real club room due to the &#039;youth&#039; atmosphere and that the studio is full with men who longs their youthful years. After the series end, you also could tell that for some seiyuus, Diamond no Ace, was a wonderful project and that they are thankful to be a part of it.<br />
<br />
I could write a long essay about all of the characters. No really. A summary about it would be that the most of the characters, like 98% of them, are all baseball idiots with a young and full of youth personality. They are also very lovable and I find myself couldn&#039;t hate any of them. Their matters are also somewhat relatable in my own life that I find myself sympathize with them. <br />
<br />
Lastly, as I said in the beginning of the review, going through Monday without Ace of Diamond : Second Season was pretty much devastating since Daiya was the reason I could smile every Monday evening. That is how much I love watching Daiya and how much I enjoyed it. It taught me many things and one of the lesson that I remembered and held dear is that &#039;Hard work makes perfect&#039;. I 100% recommend to you (after you watch the first season) if you want to know the continuation of real Japanese High School Baseball or maybe you want to watch boys playing baseball with dirt, drama and an angst here and there or for just.. Miyuki.

    This is my first time to write a fullest review,really I&#039;ve been write the same review abuout before.but,I thought previous most contents wrong grammar so I deleted it.why I write first for this? it causes most so wonderous and unforgottable story.I ever thought that so difficult and boring to playing baseball.nevertheless,my view got changed while I completed it.so,don&#039;t you&#039;d be missing out on one of the best sports anime here.<br />
<br />
Story (10/10)<br />
I give it a perfect score because it&#039;s always bring neatly-structured story.with forward plot,we have to still grips main problematics together with ascended story as first season like.notably while this season are lot of cliffhanger

        scenes.I very inspired by the dilematic and fightings so it what changed my view on baseball.also adding new characters there increases excites of fighting.<br />
<br />
Art (9/10)<br />
It might be like artistic of comedy sense.most by chibi character,part-display like a comic,Sawamura&#039;s flat face,or sometime Furuya-aura&#039;s.the placement art so accurate and nice to be funny with the personal-condition and situation.especially,while the player got playing ball.the ball movement so clear without other addings.we have to see how neat Pitcher moves while throwing ball by all-dimension,how Miyuki got amazing-catch reflect on his hand,and many more.it main cause why We got satisfied about their plays.<br />
<br />
Overall,the animation are nice and very exact if We see by the genres.don&#039;t forgot on shounen-likes art.We got shows a demon-eyes and flame-bodies while they&#039;re so spirited<br />
<br />
Sound (9/10)<br />
Madhouse has done a really great job of placing the sound with each moment and condition.there are has filled by right-fitted sound effects anf soundtracks so I got feel the excite and suspensr of their game.also I&#039;d like to include that the Seiyuu for their job.them voice it&#039;s so exact eith chararacteristic of each character.it seems like their &#039;Unite&#039; with character feelings.<br />
<br />
Overall,I&#039;d the best for this,except for the soundtracks.it was nice and properly,however about lot of complex scenes,the OST&#039;s become shortly duration.<br />
<br />
Character (9/100<br />
Even though as I said in DNA the focus is on the team and not on individual but it doesn’t mean it doesn’t have good characters in fact in my opinion the character cast of the anime is so amazing that you not only fell in love with the regular starter but also for the ones who are in the bench and are desperately pushing for the regular position. Even the opposition team gets a certain development which makes you feel bad when they get beaten. The coaches who usually don’t get the limelight are the star attraction in the anime. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10)<br />
I very enjoyed it because it can always expect a good dose of humour interlaced with the appropriate amount of emotional moments and also most contents killer cliffhunger scenes.and DnA more filled by actions each episodes more often than drama.<br />
<br />
Also the funny moments are really funny,never leave a warm-up atmosphere,they actually make it more interesting and what makes it more enjoyable.is the details about the training and how every has a specially,and even though they support to other rival as well.<br />
<br />
Overall - 9<br />
I thought this series reasonable to amust watch.it&#039;s not lose by the attractive sport anime with other.it cause that comedy sense and real-fights are main surplus of this anime.<br />

    Comparing to season 1, this season has improved a whole lot. Sawamura finally became useful. If you like Miyuki then this is the season where he shines the most. There were some epic moments here and there as well as touching moments. What I do not enjoy however, is the episode where Seido had to compete against a school with many bulky school member. I know for a fact that the author is trying to make it as a challenge that Seido had to overcome, however, it made it seem like the author is encouraging violence in sports. I can elaborate more but it can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336395">
        be seen as a spoiler so I&#039;ll just say the things that the other school did, the other school coach and the umpire at that time just really encourages violence. I really hope Seido doesn&#039;t meet that team ever again in the future.

    Note:<br />
The review is targeted to the people who have not yet seen the anime at all not even season 1 cause I believe if you have seen season 1 then it’s kind of obvious that you would have craved for season 2. But if you belong to the rare species who actually have seen the season 1 and still wondering whether to watch this season or not then I would say please watch it if not better than equally amazing equally thrilling as the 1st season was.  So I would keep the review as spoiler free as I can so that people who haven’t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213677">
        yet seen would definitely give it a try and may be have a same level of experience like I had.<br />
<br />
Well the considering the fact that the  last episode of the season would be telecasted next week  even then  it have only 3 reviews before me makes me wonder why it not so popular like other sports anime which I don’t consider it better than this anime. DNA also get compared with Major which is also an anime based on baseball which I feel is completely incorrect because as Major is anime which follows the main protagonist who is so OP that he always goes to the school / team which not good enough and end up challenging or wining against the favourites but instead of that DNA is an anime based on the TEAM and not on certain individual it also explain why a strong team needs equally strong bench players basically how a powerful team should work.  <br />
<br />
Plot: <br />
<br />
The story is about Eijun Sawamura who is pitcher who can pitch a unique moving ball because of which he is being scouted by a famous high school in Tokyo to play baseball. The story in the beginning feels like a story of naruto in baseball environment because the main protagonist has similar character traits of naruto but that’s not completely true. Instead of that the story is of Seidou high school baseball team and their journey to the ultimate destination of high school baseball in japan the Koushien.<br />
<br />
Character: <br />
<br />
Even though as I said in DNA the focus is on the team and not on individual but it doesn’t mean it doesn’t have good characters in fact in my opinion the character cast of the anime is so amazing that you not only fell in love with the regular starter but also for the ones who are in the bench and are desperately pushing for the regular position. Even the opposition team gets a certain development which makes you feel bad when they get beaten. The coaches who usually don’t get the limelight are the star attraction in the anime. <br />
<br />
Art and Sound: <br />
<br />
Well the art is done by Production I.G &amp; Madhouse who definitely have mastered how a sports anime should be done considering the fact that they have done a lot of other sports anime too so am pretty sure nobody would have any queries with the art style of the anime. It is pretty constant, colourful and vibrant. I should give them a special acknowledgment for making so many characters with almost no similarity giving them a certain level of individuality.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the sound department I think the 1st opening of the 1st season was good but rest of the opening and closing were not so much great so I end up skipping them. But the sound track in between episode was sublime I really love it. It definitely provides the extra impact in the required scenes. The work done by voice actors is also good especially coach katoaka is my favourite . <br />
<br />
Flaws: <br />

Well I don’t know a lot of them but one of the flaws is the female characters. The show has a dozens of female character but none of them really shine. Even the main so called love interest also is there because character needs a chat friend I guess. So the romances in the anime Is really negligible. The second flaw which people might feel is the pacing well I didn’t had the problem even though am a week by week regular viewer but some people feel anime could have been shorter if the pacing had been done properly . But I think you should enjoy the anime more if you marathon it because you don’t have to wait a week for a cliff-hanger to be resolved.<br />
<br />
Overall verdict: <br />
<br />
Well even with its flaws it is an exceptional anime which people consider a hidden gem and I rate it as one of the best sports anime. It’s a perfect example of an ideal slice of life, sports and shounen anime. I very much recommend it to anybody who has even a little bit of interest in any of the genre mentioned above. It can also be consider as a perfect gateway to the amazing world of sports animes which have so much to offer. I would give a solid 9/10 in a hope of watching and experiencing an anime who could even beat this. <br />

    ⠀⠀So of course I loved season two of DNA it&#039;s my 3rd favorite sport anime! And season 2 just made everything better, with Seido getting they&#039;re ticket to Nationals! <br />
 My favorite part of season 2 was when Sawamura stroke todoroki out, after 2 innings he hit it. Because it&#039;s showed how all that practice paid off, and it was the best feeling seeing Sawamura grow stronger! Overall Seido was still Seido which is the best Seido.  Some of the upcoming new teammates were introduced but hardly having any screen time. I also had a bitter sweet smile watching the 3rd years graduate, bc

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233664">
        the other years wouldn&#039;t gotten they&#039;re where they almost got last year without them. <br />
⠀So again ofc the animation was great I mean Production I.G and MADHOUSE, duh. There&#039;s some awkward things but that&#039;s just because of how its drawn in the manga, no biggie I like it better that way.<br />
 The music was fantastic as always the first opening Heroes is the catchiest thing, plus op 2 Sora ga Aozora de aru Tame ni was just everything I expect from a DNA opening. XD The BLOOM OF YOUTH ending is my favorite ending song of all anime now TRUST ME ITS SUPER CATCHY, but the seiyuu&#039;s singing the last Ed brand new blue tugged at my heart strings. <br />
 ⠀I highly recommend DNA the characters are great and it&#039;s hilariously drama filled baseball!  (Heh heh baseball is my favorite sport) I&#039;m just really bias with my sports anime.

    There are no spoilers in this review. My rating system counts story for 30% of the total, characters as 30%, art as 20%, and 20% for the sound.  <br />
<br />
I give this anime a 7.1 and I&#039;ll tell you why. For those looking for a brief summary, skip to the “Overall” at the bottom of this review. <br />
<br />
Story: 6 <br />
<br />
The story is literally about a pitcher who needs to overcome his yips (yes same exact thing as Major) in order to pitch and steal the ace number from his rival. I can’t really give the story a higher rating than 6 simply because it’s nothing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214984">
        new. I suppose the reason I’m giving this as high as a 6 is because despite the unoriginal storyline, I was hooked and eagerly awaited each new episode as it came out. If there was even a little romance involved than I might have given it a 7.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
<br />
I would have loved to give the characters higher since I really enjoyed Sawamura’s personality as the lovable loudmouth, Miyuki as the genius, and Raichi as the baseball loving freak, but Furuya ruined it for me. They also gave a serious amount of backstory to the enemy teams Seidou faced which I thoroughly enjoyed. I didn’t mind that Furuya was given as much screen time, if not more screen time than Sawamura since it worked really well in the first season to show us Sawamura’s frustration and growth, but this season there was literally no character development for Furuya at all. He had the depth of Saitama from One Punch Man except this wasn’t a satirical anime. Sure Sawamura had some development, but for someone who got so much screen time, I would have loved to see Furuya do more than literally blow steam from his body and have an intense aura. He had no development despite his huge role in the anime. <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
<br />
The art was probably the strong suit of this anime as it really knew how to bring out the intensity behind every pitch. Normally an anime that shows mostly sports games, such as Kuroku no Basket, would get boring to me after the first 50 episodes depending on how well it was done. This anime kept my attention throughout because of the careful attention paid to the backgrounds and auras of the characters when the situation on the field grew intense. Really well done.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
<br />
The sound of this anime helped carry the unoriginal story and terribly boring rival character. Shout out to Raichi’s addicting laugh and Sawamura’s chant. Also shout out to the decision to use silence as the sound that makes the most important scenes more intense.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7.1<br />
<br />
Despite the anime’s unoriginal story I found myself hooked and eagerly anticipating each episode as I waited each week. The cast had some truly memorable characters but since the character with literally no development got most of the screen time, it dragged down the anime. If not for the art and amazing sound, I probably would have dropped this anime, but they kept my eyes glued to the screen and my heart hammering. Well done Ace of Diamond. I will be watching season 3 if one comes but pray that they give the MC’s rival more development.<br />

    History: 8.5<br />
<br />
In retrospect in a show that fulfills its mission very well, it continues with what was agreed upon since its first delivery and although it feels like a repetitive process in some way, it is what this type of sports series demands and &quot;DnA&quot; takes it I ended up in a very gratifying way giving great meetings and pending promises that manage to pay off, so I don&#039;t have much more to say about this point, it fulfills its function in a gratifying way<br />
<br />
Art: 9.25<br />
<br />
On the animation side, the colors have been one of the great attractions that Diamond no Ace proposes even since

          <span style="display: none;" id="review355489">
        its prequel, and this time it maintains the same level or even I am encouraged to say that it surpasses itself, giving rise to great plays and emotional moments that transmit to the viewer<br />
<br />
Sound: 7.75<br />
<br />
In this section I continue to maintain the same position as his first season. I feel that it fulfills its task very well from OST but the OP / ED is still a pending account and I think that having the endorsement that comes with having 2 large studios like I.G. and Madhouse I think they could have played it with something more epic and deserved for this title<br />
<br />
Characters: 9<br />
<br />
This is where mainly the &quot;clip&quot; of change compared to the first installment, with characters in general much more mature and although the loss of the 3rd year was felt, they have occupied their spaces very well with new characters that They did not appear on the scene until an adaptation ago and although, perhaps, the level is not the same, they showed to have more variants in terms of players to measure up at the right times.<br />
Now going more specifically to the main trio is the most rewarding thing, especially to see Sawamura in another, more competitive facet next to Furuya and raising his level widely (although he is still Bakamura). The other great face of the show is Miyuki without a doubt, she was seen much more entrenched in her new role as captain and more than demonstrating her position.<br />
<br />
Entertainment: 9.5<br />
<br />
Personally, since the change of progression in Sawamura, the show lifts enormously from my perspective, because it was precisely what had &quot;sinned&quot; during its prequel and as I mentioned earlier it looks much more reliable as this &quot;2nd season&quot; progresses. , added to certain contemporaries that occur during the series and the epilogue that leaves it, makes it an adaptation for my irreproachable taste<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 8.8<br />
<br />
A very gratifying show that left me very hype in the face of &quot;Act II&quot; and although I know that there were certain important changes in the face of production with the Absence of I.G, we hope it will be just as fun and entertaining at least.<br />

Historia: 8,5<br />
<br />
En retrospectiva en un espectaculo que cumple muy bien su cometido, continua con lo que dejo pactado desde su primer entrega y si bien se siente como un proceso repetitivo del alguna forma, es lo que demanda este tipo de series deportivas y &quot;DnA&quot; lo lleva acabo de una manera muy gratificamente dando grandes encuentros y promesas pendientes que logran saldarse, por lo que no tengo mucho mas que decir de este punto cumple su funcion de manera gratificante<br />
<br />
Arte: 9,25<br />
<br />
Por el lado de la animacion, los colores a sido de las grandes atracciones que propone Diamond no Ace aun desde su precuela, y en esta ocasion mantiene el mismo nivel o inclusive me animo a decir que se supera a si mismo, dando lugar a grandes jugadas y momentos emotivos que trasnmite al espectador<br />
<br />
Sonido: 7,75<br />
<br />
En este apartado sigo manteniendo la misma postura que su primer temporada. Siento que cumple muy bien su tarea desde OST pero me sigue siendo una cuenta pendiente los OP / ED y creo que teniendo el aval que conlleva tener 2 grandes estudios como I.G. y Madhouse pienso que se la podrian haber jugado con algo mas epico y merecido para este titulo<br />
<br />
Personajes: 9<br />
<br />
Aqui es donde principalmente hace el &quot;clip&quot; de cambio a comparacion de la primer entrega, con unos personajes en general mucho mas maduros y si bien se sintio la perdida de los de 3° año, han ocupado muy bien sus espacios con nuevos personajes que no aparecian en escena hasta hace una adaptacion atras y si bien, tal vez, el nivel no sea el mismo demostraron tener mas variantes en cuanto a jugadores para dar la talla en los momentos justos.<br />
Ahora yendo mas especificamente al trio protagonista es lo verdaderamente mas gratificante sobretodo el ver a Sawamura en otra facetas mas competitivo al lado de Furuya y elevando su nivel ampliamente (aunque siga siendo Bakamura). La otra gran cara del espectaculo es Miyuki sin dudas se lo vio mucho mas afianzado en su nuevo rol de capitan y demostrando con creces su puesto.<br />
<br />
Entretenimiento: 9,5<br />
<br />
Personalmente desde el cambio de progresion en Sawamura el espectaculo levanta enormemente desde mi perspectiva, por que era justamente lo que habia &quot;pecado&quot; durante su precuela y como ya mencione anteriormente se lo ve mucho mas confiable a medida que avanza esta &quot;2° season&quot;, sumado a ciertos a contecimiento que suceden el transcurso de la serie y el epilogo que deja la vuelve una adaptacion para mi gusto irreprochable

    SPOILERS<br />
<br />
I’m enjoying this season just like last season. I liked a lot of the new characters too! I think they did a great job of building the story and adding a few new elements from the first season.<br />
<br />
It took me a while to get used to the new team, but I like them. I still really miss the third years but I’m glad they show up occasionally.<br />
<br />
In the first season, I liked Mei but thought that he was way too cocky. I wanted their team to lose so he could get a second humbling, but that didn’t happen. They lost nationals, but he wasn’t as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414363">
        hard on himself. They did really well but again he was overconfident before the finals. He really got a cold and blunt wake up call from the coach during their first fall game. I was shook with every word he said, but it’s true. It doesn’t matter that the team basically had a roster of star players, most of the team were playing for themselves and not as a team. Mei’s greed got him and compromised the team. It was actually quite satisfying even though I was not expecting it to go that way. Bad habits die hard.<br />
<br />
Ochiai was annoying as ever for most of the season, but it was so satisfying seeing everyone continue to prove him wrong. By seeing the players exceed his expectations after giving tips to how Coach Kataoka makes such an impact of them slowly changes Ochiai.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really appreciate best boy Nabe! He’s such a precious cutie! I’m glad he found something he enjoys while being appreciated. It’s definitely a difficult thing to suddenly lose passion or motivation for something you’ve worked hard for. It’s also tough confronting others about it, but he did a great job overcoming his fears.<br />
<br />
I’ve always loved Miyuki and seeing him grow as a captain was nice to see. He wasn&#039;t perfect, but tried his best. Zono and Kuramochi helped him too and were just as important.<br />
<br />
I loved seeing Sawamura growth. He has faced so many obstacles but overcame them. He really did so well! Despite knowing his weaknesses and that there are others who are better, he doesn’t lose his positive attitude. It motivates him to do better and to be open to suggestions. I also love the animal nicknames he start giving everyone. I just was upset that people often overlook his hard work and growth. I don’t know why people kept losing their faith or was too nervous about him pitching when he proved so often that he has changed for the better. It’s a little annoying that they focus on other players and forget what he was achieved. He didn’t even make that many mistakes during the season. To me he seemed more like the ace and I’m waiting for that to happen in season 3! The ace title is more than just skill. He’s gotten more mature, but I still love his goofy side. Both really helped bring the team up and put their trust in him.
