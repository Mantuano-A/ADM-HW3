    I never thought a story about street car racing would be this entertaining.  And if I had known what I would be watching when my friend made me watch the first few episodes, I would have said thanks, but no thanks.  ...Boy, am I glad I didn&#039;t know.<br />

Story:  On the surface, it&#039;s about a pretty bland high school guy who&#039;s got a bunch of car-crazy friends... and turns out to be the 2nd fastest driver in Akina.  (Who&#039;s first?  Ooooh, don&#039;t you wanna know?)  Below the surface...?  Okay, pretty much the same thing. ;)  Most of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review872">
        &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; is just a bunch of kids in cars racing through dark mountain passes ...or talking about racing through dark mountain passes.  I know it doesn&#039;t sound interesting if you&#039;re not into car races, but it was.  There&#039;s something about the speed and the pressure and the tension that sucks you into the show.  And of course, there&#039;s also your normal sports anime type general plot of competition and desire, rising to the challenge, overcoming obstacles, etc.<br />
<br />
Art:  I have to say, this is the biggest downside of the show.  Especially in the first season.  Thankfully, by the fourth season, there&#039;s a remarkable improvement overall in animation quality.  One of the most jarring things is the awkward usage of computer graphics for the racing scenes in the first season.  There&#039;s kind of an old-school feel to the way the people look and the brightness of the show... and then all of sudden out of no where, there&#039;s a cgi car that looks like it&#039;s from a different decade than the guy driving it.  I don&#039;t think I ever got used to that.<br />
<br />
Sound:  Personally, I always prefer subs to dubs.  Here, I would really suggest the subs... the voices for English dub didn&#039;t feel anywhere near as &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; as the Japanese actors.  Whenever I heard the dub, I felt like the voices made me like the characters less.  The downside of watching the sub, however, is the Japanese soundtrack.  Maybe it&#039;s my close-minded American taste, but I would have preferred hearing the hip-hop on the dub to whatever that was used originally.<br />
<br />
Character:  The main character, Takumi, was somewhat atypical for this genre, I think, and I liked it.  Unlike the normal archetypes like the loser who tries really hard or the cocky natural-born genius, Takumi is sort of actually unique: he doesn&#039;t know anything about cars and doesn&#039;t even really like driving.  It was a nice way for the series to start because I didn&#039;t care about street racing when I started the show either.  So, even though they toss around a little bit of racing lingo, I was never more behind than the main character was... and, as a viewer, I got a chance to become interested in street racing while Takumi got interested in it.  I really liked that his development on the show kind of went down the same road that mine did as a viewer.  So I thought they did a great job on his character design and development because his attitude and experience is what hooks you and reels you in to what I assume would be an otherwise complicated and technical world of street racing.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:  I think you can tell I enjoyed it, right?  I had to make mental notes to slow down while driving for a bit after watching the show.  Thankfully, I&#039;m too cowardly to try drifting for real!  ...And let me tell you, my Corolla never drove like the 86. ;)  I think it was also really appealling because Takumi starts off the show as what seems like a normal, typical driver -- it made me feel like there was an inner Takumi just waiting to be woken up buried somewhere in me.  (There&#039;s not, unfortunately, but I like to delude myself sometimes.)

    Vroom vroom vroom it’s anime’s most popular racing series, Initial D. Initial D stars Takumi Fujiwara, a constantly spaced-out and quiet gas station worker with no hobbies or interests in life. The normally reserved Takumi is forced into the spotlight when his incredible talent for street racing is discovered, honed by years of doing tofu deliveries for his father’s business. Takumi is forcibly encouraged by his coworkers and friends into putting his racing abilities to the test in order to defend Akina’s hometown pride. Takumi, who first considers racing completely uninteresting and cars a bore, gradually discovers the sense of accomplishment and pride his new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236689">
        skills bring, and he’s even more desperate to prove himself as a racer when his carsick love interest compliments his smooth driving.<br />
<br />
Takumi is supported by his best friend and racing fanatic Itsuki, as well as upperclassman and lead racer of the Akina Speed Stars, Iketani. Also important are the opponents Takumi races against, most notably the Takahashi brothers, elite racers whose region-ruling elder brother Takahashi analytically plots to defeat the new unstoppable racer. Initial D’s cast is generally realistic and likeable, with mild yet distinct personality archetypes. Characters are passionate about their hobby and take it seriously, but winning or losing at the sport is hardly considered the end of the world. Takumi’s interest in cars and racing grows at an appropriately slow pace and noticing the nuances of his changed perspective on the subject is rewarding and feels natural, but beyond that little of the cast evolves as people. Takumi’s hobby brings out a competitive spirit in him, but he remains unassertive and distant throughout the season. It’s endearing at first when Takumi is the underdog, his lack of charisma going full circle and becoming genuine charisma when contrasted with his confident opponents, but the small range of his personality gets old. His incompetent relationship with Natsuki is cute and does evolve throughout the show, but is otherwise uninteresting to follow. Natsuki has no involvement with the part of the show having to do with racing, and their chemistry is only supported by the childhood friend angle. I have no idea why Natsuki would be interested in a guy who only gives one word responses, doesn’t start conversations, and has no interests or hobbies, but she’s all over him. The supporting cast is weak because everyone plays diffident comic cheerleader to Takumi. The screeching and melodramatic Itsuki straddles the fine line between endearing and unbelievably annoying, just barely landing on the former because of the few subplots in which his incompetency with racing and people despite his passion garners genuine sympathy from the viewer. Iketani ends up listless outside of a short romantic subplot. He’s supposed to be Akina’s number one racer until Takumi shows up, but what little we see of his driving ability is completely unimpressive and far from knowledgeable about racing compared to the rest of the cast. Takumi is also observed in the shadows by his father Bunta, a former street racer who was legendary in his time, and his boss Yuuichi, an experienced driver and friend of Bunta.<br />
<br />
The main attraction of Initial D are the races, but there can be a lot of time between them spent on developing the next opponent, preparation, or comedy/daily life between the main characters. Probably more so than most sports anime. This can occasionally be a drag as the races themselves are never in more than three episodes, with even the final race being a meager two. The anime does assume a fair bit of prior knowledge regarding racing and car terminology on the viewer, and it’s arbitrary which parts are explained and to what detail. I had a particularly problem following the physical logic of the races, where characters would explain how a technique was pulled off but without any kind of visual aid. With little racing knowledge such as myself, hearing about how one of the cars moved by shifting gravity and whatnot seems sensible, but it’s difficult to envision and perfectly understand just through dialogue and the simple racing animations which also makes it harder to appreciate the creativity behind the races and the technique itself.<br />
<br />
While the framerate of Initial D can be choppy and there might not be a lot of movement, the art itself is solid and pleasant to look at – for the most part. Many criticize the “fish-like” eyes and lips of the character designs, but they’re meant to resemble original manga artist Shigeno Shuuichi’s art style and it’s distinct otherwise, so I like it. By far the most controversial aspect of Initial D’s animation is its use of computer-generated 3D renders for the cars. CG animation was starting to catch on around this time with many studios believing it was the natural evolution of animation. Initial D’s studios jumped the gun on what was still a niche form of animation and haphazardly shoved it into their series in an attempt to look hip and progressive. The irony, as we know now, is that the CG is immediately the aspect of Initial D that dates it the most. Even though CG was a newer animation form than the cel animation used otherwise, the older form is professionally done by experienced animators and has hit around a universal standard of quality in anime, while the CG is technologically primitive and employed by people who have less experience using it. Initial D’s CG cars are basic models that lack texture to give them a realistic surface and have bold, flat colors that contrast heavily with the surrounding environment of 2D animation. So the animation styles clash, look ugly, and break the series cohesion, but what else?<br />
<br />
Initial D’s studios also use the CG as an excuse to cut corners (as is often the case with CG ever since). One of the most noticeable things about scenes with CG in the frames is that the 2D cels they’re on will be completely unanimated. Not only is this awkward if you take the time to notice how everyone and everything in the background is as still as a tree as a car pulls up, but any attempts to mask this lack of moving frames is hilariously embarrassing. A constant technique used is to have a CG car pass in front of a group of people in the background, such as driving across a road horizontally, and then have that still frame of spectators swapped another single frame of them looking in the other direction. Cheap animation has been a part of anime since its inception, but not often will you find a 90s anime that reminds you of Astro Boy of all things. And It really is laziness – I can count on one hand the amount of times the series has 2D animation in the same frame as CG animation, but they can clearly do it. There are also occasional instances of disproportional scales and perspective, where a person standing by a car is way bigger than they should be given their distance. Use of CG also discourages use of traditional animation techniques to emphasize a sense of speed. There’s no motion lines, blur, or anything of that sort to drive that sense of whiplash in your face. <br />
<br />
This makes the way the races are directed and portrayed far duller than they have to be, or should be. Without such things as those traditional techniques noted earlier there are no ways to distinguish how fast the cars are going in the animation other than speeding up the rate at which the CG model is dragged across the screen, which could look ridiculous. The visual dynamic of the races is extremely hindered in this way, as the cars going across the screen looks the same no matter how many times they do it throughout the series. This means the drama and intensity of the races is primarily conveyed to the viewer literally, by characters commenting on what’s happening during the race or the sense of speed. But the audience should feel like a front row spectator, not needing to have it explained to them in a visual medium about racing what the stakes are or what the rhythm of the race is. The visuals should shift throughout the races to mimic the adrenaline rush and conflicts of the drivers themselves and recreate the dramatic perspective of what the characters are experiencing, rather than have it delivered in such a plain, flavorless manner that it doesn’t sell the intensity of the race but instead dilutes it by having it conflict with the excitement of the literal narrative as delivered through the dialogue. This is, without a doubt, the weakest part of Initial D. The CG cars are not cute or endearing, nor do they simply look aesthetically unappealing as they clash with the primary animation style. The real issue is that they’re an active detriment to the very core purpose of the series, that are used to circumvent positive direction and animation techniques that would make the series more exciting. The studios didn’t have the ambition to take Initial D to the level it should have been and the most important part of the show, the races, suffer greatly for it. Basically, watch Redline and note the masterful ways it manipulates the motion of its animation to emphasize fluidity and speed and notice how none of them are used in Initial D. Even noting the fact that Redline is a blatant fantasy while Initial D is more grounded, that’s no excuse why a series in that vein can’t attempt more tactful use of such techniques to push the action without crossing the line into absurdity. If it’s not even going to try any of that, then what’s the point of animating?<br />
<br />
I’m definitely interested in the future of Initial D. While storytelling progress in this first season has been leisurely at best, it hasn’t paused for long enough to give me the impression that Initial D has reached its full potential. Shuuichi Shigeno seems to realize the basics of having to introduce twists to keep the races interesting, and as he should predictably become more desperate he’ll hopefully bring more dramatic and significant deviations to the formula. This is all presumption though, as it still depends on Shigeno’s intelligence and ambition to take Initial D to the next level. Improvements in directing and animation could also be a major help. Though Initial D is a lukewarm thriller so far, there are enough hints of promise to keep me curious in where it could go so I’ll probably watch to its completion. A street racing anime is a fine concept, but it hasn’t come close to full throttle.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
I just finished this series and I KNEW I had to review it right away! Holy shit this series was a trip! Initial D is a series that everyone has heard of, but not as many people have actually watched it. It&#039;s not in the top 600 most viewed series on MAL, yet it&#039;s somehow so famous that non-anime fans know about it. We all know it&#039;s that racing anime with the CHEESIEST OST in existence that spawned all those memes. It&#039;s also one of the only pre-2000 series in the MAL top 250. The others are all series like Rose of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358457">
        Versailles, Galactic Heroes, Ashita no Joe, Evangelion. All of them are very serious, artsy kind of shows considered the crème de la crème of elitist anime...and then there&#039;s Initial D for some reason. Let me tell you straight up that this show does NOT fit in with those others. Initial D is dumb, DUMB anime and never tries to hide that for a second!<br />
<br />
Why is this anime so glorious stupid? Oh my God, where do we even start? How about our main character, Takumi Fujiwara. He&#039;s an average high school kid who works a part-time job at the local gas station and doesn&#039;t have much ambition in life. He gets poor grades, has no real plans besides inheriting his dad&#039;s tofu shop and is a very spacey, sleepy looking guy. Oh and for some reason he&#039;s the best rally driver to ever live! His dad was a great street racer and he&#039;s been forcing Takumi to deliver groceries early in the morning since he was 14. That&#039;s all the explanation we get. He&#039;s the best driver in the world and instinctively knows how to pull off physics defying drifts and drive 140 MPH around corners because he&#039;s been delivering groceries in the morning for 2 years. It&#039;s like Saitama&#039;s explanation of his powers from One Punch Man, only Initial D isn&#039;t a comedy! Well, not intentionally anyways. <br />
<br />
If you thought Kirito from SAO was OP, you haven&#039;t seen NOTHIN! In the first couple episodes, we find out that Takumi&#039;s buddies at the gas station have a local street racing team and they&#039;re horrible. They drag Takumi into racing for them and he instantly beats one of the best drivers in Japan. Takumi doesn&#039;t even know what model car he drives! He doesn&#039;t give a shit about racing. He just assumed he&#039;s an average driver and everyone in the world drove around corners at 140 MPH because he drives in the early morning and somehow has never seen anyone else drive. Yes...that&#039;s really the dumbass explanation the show goes with! This feels like an average shonen so far. Now Takumi will meet his first rival and lose for the first time right? NOPE! Takumi doesn&#039;t lose in all of season 1. He just smokes everyone for 26 episodes! It gets even better! He&#039;s driving a worse car than every one of his opponents! Takumi wins using a fucking Toyota Corolla! If Takumi was using a good car, he would have won every race in season 1 like Secretariat at the Belmont! This shit goes on for 7 seasons and he&#039;s already the best driver in Japan at the end of season 1! When I was watching the last episode I was in complete disbelief. SURELY this is where he loses. There&#039;s no way this show would be stupid enough to...OH MY GOD! I laughed so fucking hard. I LOVE this show!<br />
<br />
You might think that Initial D is just another sports shonen, but you quickly learn there is something a little &quot;off&quot; about this series. Here&#039;s a fun example. Takumi&#039;s girlfriend is a whore. I mean she&#039;s literally an underaged whore, but Takumi is so spacey and thickheaded that he never figures out he&#039;s getting cucked by half the town. Eventually Takumi finds out and confronts the issue, but that&#039;s not until about 30 volumes deep into the manga and after readers kept incessantly sending letters to the mangaka to address it. Why is that a part of this story if the mangaka never intended to write drama and wanted to focus on fast cars like he&#039;s said in interviews? Did he just think it was funny? Why?! Here&#039;s another example. There&#039;s this racer chick who tells one of Takumi&#039;s stupid friends that she&#039;ll sleep with him if he can convince Takumi to race her. After Takumi races her and utterly destroys her, she tells the buddy to meet her at 8 for sex. He gets stuck in traffic and she becomes frustrated and drives off. This sub-plot never resolves. The racing chick never gets back together with Takumi&#039;s buddy and the buddy as far as we know remains a virgin for the rest of the 48 volumes! Who in the FUCK writes like this?! Another time, Takumi finds a date for this other super obnoxious friend and she leaves him the next episode. That sub-plot also is never resolved. Why does this series keep taunting us with these romances and then jerking back at the last minute? <br />
<br />
Initial D is a seinen series. The Western equivalent would be like a Vertigo graphic novel. Something like Watchmen or Sandman. This is intended primarily for college students. You would expect that a sports drama for college students and older would take itself at least kind of seriously if it&#039;s not trying to be a raunchy comedy. Initial D is not here to play by the rules of your pathetic human logic! This is a series where an evil racer wins by forcing his opponents to crash at high speeds. Yet nobody ever gets seriously injured or dies in this series. He forces Takumi to race him by minorly injuring several of his friends in quick succession, because this show isn&#039;t even written at shonen level. It&#039;s written like bad professional wrestling! Takumi accepts the challenge and starts winning. Even though they&#039;re playing in a &quot;Super Gum Gum Death Match&quot; where you have to tie your left hand to the wheel. This is straight up some Yugioh Season Zero bullshit! What does the bad guy do? He attempts to kamikaze ram Takumi and kill them both rather than lose! Takumi dodges with a physics defying drift and the bad guy rams into the guard rail on a mountain pass at over 90 MPH. The bad guy gets some minor scrapes, but is perfectly fine. This series actually operates on &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; logic! &quot;Nobody is allowed to die in this story, just get really big boo boos!&quot; <br />
<br />
The OST is most famous aspect of Initial D and it lives up to its reputation. High energy, disco Eurotrash all the way. You know how everyone on Rateyourmusic says they only enjoy Radiohead, Bob Dylan and Richard Wagner? This music is so tasteless I think those guys would react to it like the Nazis when Indiana Jones opens the Arc of Covenant. I have an offline buddy whose favorite band is Eiffel 65 and even he might be embarrassed to blast this shit in the car! I loved every second of it!<br />
<br />
The cars are CGI and this is 1998, so gird your expectations. For the time though, it actually looked REALLY good! What doesn&#039;t look so great is the character art. Not only does it often feature those huge lips that I hate in anime, but half the male cast looks way too similar. Well it&#039;s a 90s anime, who cares if a few background characters look similar? No, I mean the main character looks similar enough to 2 other rivals that I had to do a double take a couple times. Wait was that Takumi?! Ok, yeah it was. <br />
<br />
I know I spent this entire review just kicking the shit out of it, but I actually did love Initial D. This is the perfect guilty pleasure anime! It&#039;s gloriously dumb, but ceaselessly entertaining for 26 episodes! I can&#039;t count how many times I cheered when Takumi drifted into the lead accompanied by cheesy Eurobeat. It&#039;s wonderful! Simply wonderful! I highly recommend you watch this shit!<br />

    I like watching sports anime. People who know me and have accepted the fact that I am a hardcore couch-potato find this hilarious. But the irony doesn&#039;t end there. I am a member of minority who does not possess a driving license nor has the faintest clue about driving. <br />
After my Yawara &quot;Brain-Imploding-Annoyance-Rage&quot; I was rather desperate. There were very few sports animes left I hadn&#039;t watched yet. And I was - still am actually, I can&#039;t take bludgeoned faces!- digging my heels in not to watch Hajime no Ippo. <br />
Barring any alternatives I gave in to desperation and started watching Initial D though in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review96441">
        my couch potato opinion Street-Car-Racing is no sport. <br />
<br />
The art took some getting used to. Every time I saw one of those &quot;fish-on-land-gasping-for-air&quot; mouths I just wanted to smash my fist into it. But then pretty soon something weird happened. I got sucked into the Takumi-Bunta duo. <br />
The story itself is nothing world-moving; the synopsis tells it perfectly accurate. <br />
Like ParaParaJMo says, this anime&#039;s hook for me was and is Takumi. He is not only a reluctant hero, but rather a lethargic hero. He breaths, he talks and he walks and he helps out his father with the tofu shop by driving out the goods but driving, it is a chore, that must be done. His heart is not in it. It is not that he is lazy but he has no passion nor any direction in life. Enter the &quot;woman&quot; and the rock starts rolling. <br />
God knows, I would have been as much interested if not more if this was Bunta&#039;s -Takumi&#039;s father- story, because Bunta is a character like Hiruma &amp; Co (Eyeshield 21). He does things with a purpose even if the main character doesn&#039;t have the dream of a clue why. In that manner, Bunta started his son on driving 5 years ago, when he was barely out of diapers and from what we understand he was a strict master. And the fruits of that are now very visible in Takumi. <br />
I like an anime if I like the characters. I have watched and liked animes, anime-lovers would diss. I watch sports animes;  yet I barely know the rules of any of the sports; just because I like the characters. The characters here grew on me too. Well most of them anyway. And in Itsuki&#039;s case (Takumi&#039;s best friend) it was rather like fungus. The development and growth of the characters drives the story on. Even though it is a repeated plot reel, - there is a challenge, Takumi drives, Takumi wins- weirdly it never gets old and you find yourself engaged time and again. <br />
The music is just awesome. It had me wiggling around on my couch so much so that I had a b.tt-print on it every time I watched it.<br />
I would have enjoyed it to the max if the female folk wasn&#039;t in there. And that is my only gripe about this anime. Honestly, I think the Mangaka needed to get laid really bad, or may be I am too outlandish but the female folk of this anime is just horrendous. Here is a summary of the female cast in this anime<br />
Takumi&#039;s first love interest: A teenage prostitute. Literally. Also rather &quot;I haven&#039;t exposed myself in the last 30 seconds so let me show you my panties&quot; type. Color me stiff but if my girlfriend is ok with showing her panties to my father, I&#039;d be rather &quot;peeved&quot;!<br />
Mako: a challenger, also a love interest to Iketani, one of Takumi&#039;s friends/Sempai; here is what she says to Iketani: If you make the race happen between me and Takumi I will sleep with you. <br />
Kyoko, a love interest to Keisuke: 3 Seconds after she sees him, he is her &quot;Darling&quot; and she is a whiny, clingy, .... something. <br />
Oh and the mother is not even mentioned. <br />
The art does get better, And by that I mean, thank God they do lose their utmost annoying fish mouths. And the girls are not always there so my annoyance was kept in check, which is why Initial D gets 9 Enjoyment points and 8 overall. <br />
I recommend trying out Initial D. And extend the 3 episode rule to 4 if you are still undecided because Takumi doesn&#039;t officially race before the 4th episode.  Initial D is worth at least that much of your time.<br />
<br />

    I was really hard-pressed to decide what to rate this anime. I&#039;ve known about this anime for more than 10 years but never came around to watching it. The thing I find amazing about this anime is how much it pulls you in to the story. Everything is executed perfectly. I admit, especially from watching it now when CG is so much better than it was almost 20 years ago, that the CG kind of turned me off but overlooking this anime because of that reason would be a big mistake. This anime manages to create excitement, intensity, great comedy, compelling romance and wonderful character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review94173">
        development. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not into cars nor am I into racing but this anime somehow pulls me in anyway? How?? I can only speculate that the characters and execution of the plot and story is just too well done. Even when ignoring the racing aspect, the setting of having a character completely un-interested in racing grow as a character was so entrancing. All the characters see the main character Takumi grow. The interesting thing is even when the story focuses on other characters in the story, I didn&#039;t lose any momentum or interest in the show. All of the character were well-rounded and all had their own worries, goals, and ambitions in the show. Each racer was striving to become better and find their own identity. This anime, consistently manages to introduce to people with no interest in racing or cars, and keep glued in anticipation to the outcome of the race, and the outcome to the character&#039;s problems. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack was very great. And I&#039;ve become hooked on the ringtone that Sayuki used on her phone. If anyone finds it leave me a comment on my profile. xD I thorougly enjoyed this anime not only because I learned about racing and the racing culture but I discovered some good romance in the story as well. Part of the reason for this is the way they executed the drawing of the girls as well as they used, and the plot made the romance engrossing and personal. Despite their blocky like heads, the artists managed to capture that moment when you see a girl that just makes you drop your jaw and heart skip a beat. Being able to create a mood like that especially when I&#039;m biased against older looking anime just speaks of how well the animators created mood using the art, costume, character, and music. It just does everything right.<br />
<br />
The climax and situation reversals were logically well-thought out and never have I been unsatisfied or bored with the characters in the show or the outcome of the races. The characters are all utilized to their full effect for the main plot, racing, comedy, romance, or some combination thereof. Despite some of the technical nature of racing itself, the show feels really authentic and still manages to pull off some great comedy and romance as well. The reason why I&#039;ve decided to give this a 9 (Great) versus an 8 (Very Good) is not all anime can pull in an audience that have no interest in the sport of racing or race cars and this anime manages to pull that off by having an amazing story. Initial D: First Stage is not only an example of how to do things right but how to introduce audience to a world completely foreign to them and suck them into the story. This isn&#039;t an anime about racing alone but about racers, a racer&#039;s identity, and the people&#039;s stories surrounding them. A studio could&#039;ve done everything the same, the races, the plot, the music, the art and with different pacing and transitions executed poorly. But Initial D: First Stage from racing to comedy, comedy to romance, romance to racing, gets it all right, all the way till the finale.

    At first, I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that I did not think I would like the concept at first, but other factors which I will further elaborate on would keep on pulling me into this franchise and would like it more and more. I know it&amp;rsquo;s not the most exciting or appealing anime, and that I&amp;rsquo;m not the biggest gear head, but I felt something special about this one. Even though Takumi is not exactly the most appealing anime character of all time, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of weird that his lack of charisma in some ways makes him charismatic at the same time because he does all his talking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8589">
        behind the wheel and he&amp;rsquo;s a monster at it, and yet, he thinks his abilities are nothing special. The cast is well rounded and they all get equal attention for the most part. There&amp;rsquo;s not much that goes with story, but the characters is what really drives this anime. But it still has a lot of elements such as some romance, lots of comedy, and it&amp;rsquo;s a different kind of coming of age story.<br />
<br />
I&amp;rsquo;ll admit the character design isn&amp;rsquo;t really the most beautiful, nor is the coloring the most glossy. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s nothing really great, but the character design is diverse and distinctive in lets say in comparison to Gundam SEED&amp;rsquo;s, nor way too generic like History&amp;rsquo;s Strongest Disciple Kenichi. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit Shigeno, the manga artist has a weird way of drawing, but he does have a style of making some of his characters, especially Ryosuke, look distinctively Japanese rather than relying too much on the trademark anime big eyes. Plus, there is none of this wacky hairstyle or hair color bull crap that is so trendy, so I was able to be glad to be away from that.<br />
<br />
Plus, the designs of the cars are of course accurate to that of the real cars themselves. I really like how they used CG for the races and it brings a trademark trait to this show. Granted the CG isn&amp;rsquo;t that impressive looking, but this was 1998. Look at the other CG cartoons that were out back then and compare it to where CG is now in 2008. But despite that, the physics for the most part I will probably have to assume are 95% real because the drift king himself, Tsuchiya Keiichi, was an advisor to the races. A lot of environmental factors are put into play with the outcome such as gutter gripping on the corners for traction. Also, all of the courses present in the show are real life mountains, except Akina is really named Haruna and from what I have heard, they are accurately represented. The show has a lot of technical jargon in relation to the cars and driving techniques. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have any prior knowledge, it will be hard to understand but at least you&amp;rsquo;re getting something educational in some bizarre regard.<br />
<br />
Now time to really talk about what made me a fan, the Eurobeat music. I first got into this anime in 2000 and was a junior in high school, and I was playing Para Para Paradise every weekend at my local arcade. I loved the music and even found other non-game dance routines on the internet and got addicted to the music. Then one day, my friend gave me this anime to watch and told me to watch it. I thought the opening theme, Around the World by Move, was pretty cool and catchy. Then, the moment things got underway, I immediately recognized the first song, Space Boy by Dave Rodgers and the last song, No One Sleeps in Tokyo by Edo Boys, and I thought, hey, this soundtrack alone has me sold. The Eurobeat in this anime is as synomous and central as is the jazz in Cowboy Bebop. I never watched the dub and to this day, I will refuse to watch it. I heard they change the music to 7th grade level grunge rock and to me, doing that is like replacing the jazz in Cowboy Bebop to Achy Breaky Heart! But trying to put a portion of my biases aside, I felt that the fast paced nature of Eurobeat really suits the fast paced atmosphere of this anime in its own unique way like that.<br />
<br />
The Japanese voice cast is also very excellent and multi-talented. I think Miki Shin&amp;rsquo;ichiro does a great job as Takumi. He does a great job of being quiet and unassuming, but in certain moments, he knows how to sound enraged if you push the right buttons on him. And the voice of Kaneda from Akira, Iwata Mitsuo, is funny as Itsuki. I just love it when he goes Kuuuuuu sound when he&amp;rsquo;s excited. And I really loved Koyasu Takehito as Ryosuke and his role in playing Ryosuke is why he&amp;rsquo;s my favorite character. He&amp;rsquo;s very serious about what he does and he is very charismatic and intimidating, but yet, knows how to act approachable at the same time. Tomokazu Seki as Keisuke I like him being so moody, hot tempered, and is straight out no nonsense. And to conclude, the sounds of the car engines are actually based on the real cars themselves. I saw a documentary on Initial D one time and they showed how they got the real car engine sounds and applied them to the anime. Unfortunately, I will restate I have never seen the dub, but have heard only bad things about it. <br />
<br />
OK, I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that you might not be able to relate to this anime nor most of its characters, or more specifically their situations. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely not for casual anime fans, or those who like Naruto, Bleach or DBZ. Hell, it&amp;rsquo;s not even for a lot more dedicated anime fans as well. But as a Para Para Paradise veteran, I just felt the music alone was something I could relate to and I know it&amp;rsquo;s weird to get into some animes based on that. But eventually, I personally came to embrace Initial D the anime itself. I just felt because it was something out of the norm, I was able to enjoy it. So if you&amp;rsquo;re truly looking for something different, I say give Initial D a try. I know this anime is not for everyone, but it takes the right circumstances when you get into it to enjoy it for some people.

    Vroom Vroom, if you&#039;re into street racing then you&#039;ll love initial D. Tak is so gosh darn thicc and irresistible, and my homeboy Shingo can hit a drift faster than anybody can smack that nae nae. Whevever my homeboy Tak does a drift everyone goes zoo wee mama, including me. Bunta is smarter than any Rick and Morty and he smokes really cool. Because of him i&#039;ve become a heavy smoker and my life expectancy has gone down to 30 years. My boy itsuki sucks at drifting, but he is such a qt π and he does the most epic fails xD. Overall, I&#039;d give

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269298">

    Yeah, this is one of those shows that have a niche audience that I&#039;m not gonna have interest in continuing further with. I&#039;ve heard quite a bit about Initial D since college where it was popular with street racing fans and even served as a gateway drug to anime for some. It even gets poked fun of for its subpar animation in some comedy anime like Lucky Star and School Rumble, which I&#039;ll cover a little later in this review.<br />
<br />
Pretty much, Initial D&#039;s selling point is the various street racing competitions that male lead Takumi and his friends are involved with. Plenty of in-depth terminology

          <span style="display: none;" id="review146143">
        on the various cars and their parts are part of regular conversation between racers as they hype up the capabilities of their car and driving, as well as any reputation that a reputable racer within the series has. The races are genuinely suspenseful, albeit predictable in their outcomes and usually defy real-life physics, as Takumi finds himself regularly challenged by other street racers throughout the course of the series as he adjusts to the street racing craze and improves his skills in later episodes against unique challenges like a &quot;duck tape death match&quot; or racing in unfamiliar territory. The series does delve into backgrounds and developments of some prominent characters in the series, but many are hard to connect with due either to lacking much in personality (mostly applies with Takumi), are archetypal to a great extent or only exist as challengers to Takumi and to gawk at his exceptional driving skills when he beats them. Essentially, Initial D is mostly focused on racing and you will find yourself rather bored of the series if you are expecting anything more out of it.<br />
<br />
Visually, Initial D is quite subpar sporting rough lining and washed-out colors for its scenery and characters designs, the latter sticking out quite prominently with the faces of said characters looking quite off. The races and cars within the series are animated entirely in CGI which looks quite a bit on the cheap side in terms of rendering and the audience in said races looking like cardboard cut-outs while races are in action during many shots. On the plus side, Initial D&#039;s techno soundtrack is quite catchy and upbeat, going along nicely with many parts of the show and doing well at making the races in the series seem genuinely intense.<br />
<br />
Even with said soundtrack though, it isn&#039;t enough to have me wanting to see more of Initial D. The title&#039;s premise appeals to a rather niche audience and doesn&#039;t have much else that sticks out with it beyond its cliched characters and subpar visual presentation. Your mileage will definitely vary with this one.

    Welcome, to my first ever review on this website!<br />
<br />
Introduction:<br />
Initial D is one of the first anime I&#039;ve ever watched, back when I was young and did not know much about anime and cars. Every single race that immediately got me hooked on, the mesmerizing euro beat soundtracks on standing out on a league of their own and of course, the characters, changed me. We&#039;ll get onto those in detail in a bit. To me, cars and anime were never really my thing, but after watching this show I wanted to get a license, I could not wait until I was legally allowed to get one.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415762">
        It motivated me, to advance in my life.<br />
<br />
Story (10/10):<br />
The story of Initial D is quite simple and easy to grasp. You can watch your TV, phone, computer screen, or whatever you watch it on laid back. A high school student works part time at a gas station, where he meets his co-workers, who are car freaks and members of the &quot;Akina Speed Stars&quot;. I shall not tell you more about it. If what you read convinced you so far, you should watch it unfold yourself.<br />
<br />
Art (7/10):<br />
The weakest point of Initial D. The animation is sometimes fully computer generated, which I am not really judgeful against, it&#039;s more of a &quot;save the budget&quot; thing. The artstyle of this anime though, is not far from the manga. Their facial expressions and the way they look in general look exactly how they looked in Shigeno Shuuichi&#039;s source material, if not, even better. With sharp details onto the characters that tend to be underlooked at distant angles, but a problem it is not, as it&#039;s not a series that focuses the most on its art and animation.<br />
<br />
Sound (10/10):<br />
Music<br />
Car racing and Eurobeat go hand-to-hand now, that is because of Initial D. I would not blame anyone that would listen to a 10 hour playlist of just Initial D music and doing a car crash. The music is just so fitting. The uplifting and energetic atmosphere work perfectly mixed together.<br />
Voice Acting (Sub)<br />
I have watched this series with subtitles, therefore, hearing their original &quot;Seiyuus&quot;. The voice acting is pretty good. Takumi Fujiwara was one of Shinichiro Miki&#039;s first roles and I could not say it was a disappointing one. It managed to portrait the type of a human being Takumi is. The rest of the cast&#039;s voices match their personality also, as most of the people chosen to voice are solid voice actors that provided hard work in the industry for decades. I would not go on with this until I talk about Keiji Fujiwara, which was an amazing voice actor. His voice was just so awesome and in character and I would never forget him. May rest in peace, Keiji Fujiwara! Your work shall always be remembered.<br />
<br />
Character (10/10):<br />
A strong point to this series are its characters. Takumi Fujiwara, an 18 years old genius. He is not an archetype of a driving series&#039; main character, in fact, his apathic attitude makes him stand out. He is not this overly energetic loud bastard, he is rather reserved but sharp. Looking at him for the first time, you would not think to yourself that he, is the second fastest racer in Mount Akina. The rest of the characters blend in perfectly and their interactions are real. There is rivalry, there is friendship, even a tad bit of romantic atmosphere between some characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10):<br />
I absolutely LOVED watching this show. Every single episode, every single minute spent on it felt like a ride. A night ride, that is. This show has actually changed me as a person, as well, as I previously stated in the introduction. Developed an inner love for cars in me that I didn&#039;t even know I had.<br />
<br />
Overall (10/10):<br />
Treat yourself and start watching this series right now. I could not recommend it to you more. Likeable characters, simple story, absolutely amazing soundtrack and an enjoyable one, that is. Watch it and see for yourself.<br />
<br />
If you agree with my review, be sure to give it a &quot;Helpful&quot; button. If you don&#039;t agree, haha, well that&#039;s unfortunate. Maybe talk to me about it, as I&#039;m open to discussions about this series.

    Short Review: (click &quot;Overall Rating&quot; for scores)<br />
<br />
Overall: The best racing/ car anime. I think people who are not into cars and racing will enjoy it too. Definitely worth to watch!<br />
<br />
The show starts slow but after a few episodes when the racing starts you are instantly hooked. The story is good, and is like an introduction to the later seasons. <br />
This anime is from the late 90&#039;s so the art style is not high quality, and probably the worst aspect of this season (art style becomes better in later seasons). Sound is ok, nothing notable negative. <br />
Caracters have development, but might not seem very deep (in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387364">
        first season). <br />
I really enjoyed this anime and the way the races are presented really keeps you on edge and your eyes glued to the screen. This anime has made a number of people interessted in carculture and racing for a reason.

    THIS THING IS A MASTERPIECE! When I first started watching Initial D, I dodn&#039;t like the old CGI and art style, but that&#039;s only the first season. And OH MAN is the story good. Also the music is outstanding. The show builds up drama in a very good and entertaining way. From a person that likes cars, I want to say that this is the best show I have ever watched. <br />
if you don&#039;t like cars/japanese car culture, this could be a great incroduction, but that&#039;s not what you watch a show for, so I&#039;ll just leave it here. Peace!

    A friend told me about this Series, the other day. I was skeptical when he explained what it was about. He said it was about street racing and mainly about the cars. To be honest, I am not all that interested in cars. I am like the next person and have a mediocre interest, but not enough where I would be overly excited to watch a series about cars. <br />
<br />
I was hanging out with my friends at his house when he insisted that we watch Initial D. Still skeptical, i try to convince him to put in something else.. but he was dead set on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27888">
        me watching this series. We started watching the series in the morning, and by the time we stopped I had watched nearly every episode in the first stage.<br />
<br />
It never accrued to me that I would have any interest in cars or street racing, until i watched this show. I found myself getting excited or anxious about the coming scene. We ended on episode 20 of 26. Immediately upon going home I decided watch the remainder of the stage online. <br />
<br />
I won&#039;t say this series was the best I had ever watched, because it most definitely falls short of my favorites, but it definitely made my must see list. The series had a couple major downfalls in my eyes. 1: The Animation was little to be desired. 2. The Animation of the cars did not mesh very well with the animation of the characters. However, the plot and entertainment of the series definitely made up for the shortcomings of the two. Besides those two it was very enjoyable. It doesn&#039;t matter if you have interests in cars or racing, it is enjoyable nonetheless.<br />
<br />
In my eyes the characters were &quot;iffy&quot;. I didn&#039;t so much enjoy some major traits in a few of the characters. For example Iggy. I understand that some people are naturally like Iggy, but to me he was pretty annoying. Then again, the series wouldn&#039;t be what it is without him. I&#039;m just saying, i get frustrated with him while watching. Looking back in retrospect, that was more than likely what the developers had in mind; to keep the viewer interested.<br />
<br />
As for the sound: They did very well in the Japanese Version. The opening theme for the Japanese Version is much better than the opening for the English version. The Japanese version seemed to have more crisp sound compared to the English version. It simply fell short. However, I only watch English Dub. So the English Version sufficed.<br />
<br />
Overall the series was very enjoyable. It made my must see list. I will recommend this series to anyone. It was worth my time, so I believe it is worth yours too. Rewatch Value: Medium- Very High

    To be as brief as possible:<br />
<br />
If you like other competition/battle anime because of:<br />
<br />
* Tension of who is going to win/stakes<br />
* Strategy/technique/application of abilities<br />
* Visuals/audio/spectacle<br />
* A passionate, interesting main character or team<br />
<br />
There is nothing for you here. Turn back while you can. <br />
<br />
In a normal sport/battle show, you might have the main character be good at *one* or *two* things at the start. Just a couple advantages that let them really shine under the right conditions. Takumi, the main character, is not like that. He is a god of racing, ordained to always win no matter how stacked the odds are against him. He never has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review385534">
        to practice or ask for help. A perfect driver, incapable of failure or struggle. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s no tension there.<br />
<br />
That could be excusable if the *how* of him winning was interesting. Slowing down the race, moment by moment, and showing his thought process and how both himself and his competitor were thinking and what techniques they were using. Really keying us in to how they&#039;re both using the differences in their vehicles to get whatever advantage they can. Using the quirks of their respective vehicles in interesting ways we can appreciate. It has none of those sorts of things you might see in a show like Hajime no Ippo or Hunter X Hunter - but for driving. <br />
<br />
Regarding visuals - they&#039;re OK but ultimately hurt the show too. The 3D and 3D animation is solid enough considering the time period. However, it heavily re-uses shots, and doesn&#039;t ever seem to get creative with the camera - which is unfortunate as it&#039;s the most major advantage of 3D. Unlike 2D, the animation can&#039;t &quot;bend&quot; to make things appear fast or exciting, so a lot of the shots feel really stale and slow even if the cars are moving at high speed. <br />
<br />
Finally, Takumi is a passive character. The story happens *to* him, not as a result of his own ambition or drive. He&#039;s a boring, laid-back character and it sucks a lot of the life out of it. Why should I root for this guy? <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t see how this show is as popular as it is. Yes, Takumi is an underdog that wins. But that on its own does not a story make. There needs to be suspension of disbelief, a gradual improvement in the character&#039;s abilities and their application, something. *Anything*. <br />
<br />
Music is cool though, so it&#039;s got that I guess.

    First Stage review<br />
Who would have thought that the fastest driver in town is just your everyday tofu delivery boy. High schooler Takumi Fujiwara’s perception of driving changes after being encouraged to enter his first street race. Remember it’s illegal!<br />
Story –<br />
You would think that an anime revolving around street racing would get pretty dull after a couple of races or so but that is not the case with Initial D. The story begins with the laid-back Takumi being forced to enter a street race by his father which was meant to be Ikitani’s problem who is his co-worker at his part-time job. Takumi accepts the proposal

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203140">
        and wins it in convincing fashion with an ulterior motive, which is he would be rewarded with a full tank of gas for his date with a girl named Natsuki. <br />
There is romance development but it’s not a major thing in this season from what I’ve seen. After seemingly doing the impossible, Takumi inevitably gains a reputation of being the fastest driver on Mt. Akina that drives a [i]’Toreno 8-6’[/i] which gets rumours spreading mainly about his skill. This results in numerous challenges being thrown at Takumi one after another, with each being under different circumstances that gives rise to an entertaining racing series. After overcoming many challenges, Takumi comes to a realisation that there is more to being a good driver in street racing.<br />
<br />
Art –<br />
The computer graphics should be highlighted as it’s either a hit or miss with some people. The fact that it composes 50% of the driving scenes signifies its overall importance as without it, this anime just may not be possible. The fact that the CG used in an anime made in the late 90s makes it kind of surreal in a sense, as the quality was fantastic and maybe on par with series further down the timeline. The CG animation was smooth throughout and never really dragged too much which left a great impression on me. The only real downside to the CG is when certain scenes are used for more impact such as the slow-motion which makes the CG look awkward compared to a faster moving scene that is more natural.<br />
 That said, the CG was well choreographed with the human backgrounds being used effectively at certain angles. The hand-drawn art however was tolerable as it used standard designs that are prevalent in many series but I hadn’t set any expectations considering how dated it was anyway. The background art was more pleasing to the eyes than the character designs personally which adds to the overall experience. I’d rather watch this show for the CG which just shows you the sheer difference between the two elements.<br />
Sound -<br />
Probably one of my favourite aspects of the show. The method in which the tracks were used every time a street race would take place would get me excited. The tracks that were used in the races were various and consisted of some very nice vocals. The tempo and pace at which the pace at which the tracks were played is another plus, as they never went on for too long whilst remaining sufficient and appropriate for the different parts. The show had that natural 90s tune every time a slice of life scene came into play which always gets to me. The OP/END themes were OK as they really are there just to get you hyped for the contents of the episode. Skip them and save time.<br />
Characters<br />
Character development for the MC is evident throughout this show and so you must be blind to casually dismiss it. Takumi is very caring and holds much respect to the ones close to him as he detests other making vulgar remarks humiliating his friends which brings consequences. Takumi is quick to act, which is seen from him getting into a physical brawl or through a driving challenge. Takumi before being addicted to street racing would just see driving as a normal thing that helped his family’s business. After his numerous feats against other drivers, he really understood the joy of being in the race and the thrills it gave off to the competitors and even the spectators who are everywhere.<br />
The side characters were also explored in some depth such as his chummy best friend Itsuki and co-worker Ikitani who both had their fair share of problems regarding other drivers. The number of mistakes that led to Takumi being called to correct their faults was numerous, which was something I despised greatly as it gave off the impression that he is truly dependable at any time.<br />
The other challengers were analysed to various levels such as the Takahashi brothers from the Redstuns who were primarily responsible for Takumi’s awakening for the streets. The Night Kids also had some members who literally put Takumi in a tricky situation that may be interpreted as being too extreme. There was also a lot of focus on identity evaluation/perceptions as was the case with the female driver at Uuso pass.<br />
Verdict –<br />
The series was so enjoyable that it didn’t take me that long to finish it. I would recommend this to anyone seeking a competitive racing series with high stakes involved or maybe any car enthusiast as some of the terminology really threw me for a loop. A very good series 8/10.<br />

    To start off this review, I have to say; the saying &quot;it&#039;s not for everybody&quot; has never been more accurate for anime.  As a huge car enthusiast, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and finished it in only two days (first stage).  Because most cars are automatic nowadays, most people won&#039;t have any idea about how manuals work or even about the lost art of double clutching or toe/heel techniques.  Seeing little things like this was totally nostalgic and made the show just that much better for me.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
<br />
I thought it had a pretty interesting story-line, and while some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181898">
        may not agree; I feel Initial D was very strong in setting up situations to force Takumi into racing.  The races themselves were extremely enjoyable as well not to mention intense, seeing a beefed up Corolla go against the likes of &quot;Godzilla&quot;, the RX-7&#039;s rotary engine even to the unicorn farting V-TEC.  In all serious, these cars were legends in the 90&#039;s; especially the RX-7 so much so that when two of your favorite cars go at it in this anime you&#039;d never want to see one or the other lose.  Only thing that annoyed me was all the Silvia&#039;s in this show and they were pretty much fodder for the other cars.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
<br />
Alright, now this is an anime from 1998.  Comparing this to Nagi no Asukara&#039;s art, it quite literally looks like a 16 bit NES game.  However, the CGI when racing was pretty good especially for 15-16 year old anime.  Other than that, character designs were pretty inconsistent, the backgrounds like the ones at school were okay.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
<br />
I&#039;d have to say sound quality was pretty bad.  If I wasn&#039;t watching subtitles I&#039;d imagine trying to pick up what Itsuki was saying would be pretty challenging as his audio seemed to be muffled a lot.  The exhaust and engine sounds were pretty good, though you&#039;d never really be able to notice a turbo kicking in even though I&#039;d say they were in the 1500-3000 rpm range most of the time.  <br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
<br />
I would have to say the opponents were often the most interesting characters.  They each had their own style or method of winning whether it be higher horsepower numbers or playing around with weight distribution to mess someone up.  Takumi is a pretty bland main character, but I absolutely hated his girlfriend; mostly for being a slut.  Itsuki got pretty annoying at times but I felt he was a necessity.  To be frank, the one with the most personality was probably the AE86.  I enjoyed seeing that car and its Tofu vinyl more than anyone in the show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
Like I said before, this anime isn&#039;t for everyone.  If you love cars I would highly recommend watching this. Despite all the flaws in it, I still enjoyed it thoroughly.  I&#039;m about to start watching the Second Stage and am looking forward to it because it seems that the AWD EVO is up next.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
Even if you don&#039;t like cars, I would still suggest trying it out.  If you watch the first race and still don&#039;t like it, then from there I would suggest dropping it.  I would highly recommend doing a little research on Japanese Automotives and its history as well as notable vehicles before watching it though.  It&#039;ll make the experience much more enjoyable.

    Just finished Initial D, and I have to say it was a wild ride, it was a lot of fun. The races were pretty much the only attraction to this show, but they were filled with a lot of hype, tension and excitement. Just watching the cool drifting and thinking about how a certain character was going to win was a lot of fun, the racing was great. <br />
<br />
The sound track was also really good, it had a huge variety in tracks and the famous eurobeat music just added to the excitement of the races and the show overall. The eds/ops were also really nice,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review360621">
        musically this show was great and it has its own unique identity with its Eurobeat.<br />
<br />
Other than that the show is a bit lacking, the story is kind of simple, and the writing is fine. I do think the MC Takumi is a bit too good, I know he practiced driving before but he beat other prodigies who had years of experience and practice and the MC would waltz into a race without so much as a day of practice and just improv and win. But maybe that added to the excitement as there were a lot of foes who Takumi in theory shouldn&#039;t have been able to beat, but he did somehow manage to scrape one. <br />
<br />
I like Takumi&#039;s laid back personality and his adventure on slowly discovering his passion, I think he still has a little bit to go with that which is hopefully picked back up in the sequels. I think most of the other side characters are fine, nothing that exceptional about them but likable enough. With the exception of the best friend character who was very loud, obnoxious, stupid, the best friend character generally annoyed me a lot of the time, this show would be slightly improved if he just didn&#039;t exist.<br />
<br />
The animation is kind of low quality, the CGI cars did bug me initially, I became fine with it after a while and for this era it may have been hard to do all the drifting in 2D without a really big budget.<br />
<br />
Despite Initial D&#039;s faults it was a lot of fun and that mainly comes down to the races and soundtrack, it lacks in other areas, but I don&#039;t think that really matters as I still had a blast.

    This is my first review and I just finished Initial D so I thought that writing a review could be a good idea. This review is only about the first stage and not the whole franchise.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10: The story is pretty classic and is all you might want from an anime about street-racing. It&#039;s about recklessness, the will to aim always higher, etc...It&#039;s most of the time over the top, but in a good way: after each episode of Initial D you&#039;ll get seriously fired up, and even eating a sandwhich afterward will be fucking epic, it will have the taste of sweat and victory

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175123">
        as you headbang to techno music.<br />
Which is my next subject:<br />
<br />
Music: 9/10: Damn, that OST is awesome. If you are into Eurobeat, just watch it already, but if you hate that 90s techno music, just go away, this anime is simply not for you and you will dislike it even if you like the characters and the story. However, I did not rate it 10/10 for one reason: when the race start, the music is intense and all, but once it ends and you come back to the daily life of the protagonists, the OST becomes old and unoriginal, sadly.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10: This anime isn&#039;t just a race after an other, there&#039;s actually a lot of enjoyable characters. The MC, while some people might call him a Gary Stu (his ennemies have literally no chance to win), there&#039;s actually some character development and your typical sleepyhead who becomes a beast when driving actually shows some depth. The same can be said about his crew and his opponents.<br />
Also, the interaction between the characters are really interesting in the sense that they are rather mature and it shows (the way they handle the romance, for exemple, isn&#039;t the way it would be in your typical anime).<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10: And now the worst part. Time wasn&#039;t really gentle with that anime. The art isn&#039;t great, the animation isn&#039;t fluid and worse, the CGI is horrible. Of course, I can easily imagine that at the time it was airing, those who watched it found it outstanding, but CGI gets old really fast, sadly.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10: It was amazing, I just can&#039;t stop listening to Night of Fire at full blast (and my mom now thinks I&#039;m weird) and even if the CGi got old, the anime is still as enjoyable nowadays as it was before because a good anime never really dies and Initial D is definitely one of those.

    Takumi Fujiwara is an average 18-year old high school student with an average job as a gas station attendant, and a not-so-average hand in the family business. To help his father&#039;s tofu shop, Takumi has been delivering tofu in his father&#039;s &#039;Eight-Six&#039; Trueno to a hotel at the peak of Mt. Akina. Every night at 4 a.m. He&#039;s is brought into a world full of street racing and eventually over time feels compelled to become the best drift racer in all of tokyo. He is soon plunged into a world of competition and contests against some of the greatest racers in the japan prefecture.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review96171">
        story may not be its strongest aspect and just by reading it, may turn some viewers off if they are not the type of car junkie otaku fans but the focus and attention in this series is to the Characters. Takumi which has the personality of a very layed back fellow who just enjoys his work and doesn&#039;t think much of his driving skills. Using his fathers car to deliver tofu on the downhill at Mt. Akina. That is until fate decides to change his determination and course of action when lots of rivals wonder who is the driver in the AE86, thus many challengers want to challenge this ghost of the streets. The journey towards takumi becoming a legendary racer begins.<br />
<br />
Takumi has a very charismatic and charming personality and will do anything to protect his friends. Itske his closest and best friend, at first glance is like the otaku nerd of all things cars but even though he may be in over his head some times and some times gets him self into trouble or overthinking things at times. Takumi is always their to have his back. Both of these characters have great contrast between each other, other characters you will meet soon join up with takumi at first our rivals, but soon their after become great friends.<br />
<br />
<br />
Created in 2-D animation, contrasting noticeably with the technically detailed look of the cars and races, which are recreated with 3-D CGI for the anime. While the integration of 2-D and 3-D is somewhat awkward in the early episodes, it improves greatly as the series progresses to the point to where both the CGI and animation blend pretty seamlessly together. The character designs get better also, with more detailed facial expressions becoming quite evident later in the series.<br />
<br />
The races are edited and designed with great skill and thought. These sequences are genuinely exciting even to those of us who never followed any kind of racing action sequences before and action movie car chases. Most fans will feel that they need to be a greese monkey or an automobile expert to enjoy this show. That is not true.  The technical aspects of this form of racing, particularly the all-important practice of &quot;drifting,&quot; are adequately spelled out for novices to the point to where the series might even be called educational.<br />
<br />
The music track deserves singling out for its lively collection of pulsating, catchy songs in the &quot;Eurobeat&quot; style popular in Japan a mix of rock, hip hop, and techno. The songs come into play in the opening and closing credit sequences and during the racing sequences where they work perfectly. The instrumental tracks during the quieter scenes are expertly done as well when trying to convey emotion through the characters. <br />
<br />
Though the series does primarily focus on racing as a  core concept for the driving of the plot and characters, their is a blend of romance and relations and i like how the series balances both of these elements together creating something that is not just about racing, but also what happens to these characters in their every day lives and their romantic encounters they come across, this obviously being the first season i expect more development in this area in subsequent seasons.<br />
<br />
I have seen quite my share of anime in a variety of different genre&#039;s, but ive never seen an authentic car racing anime before, that being one of the smallest target audiences. At first glance it was hard for me to get into the show because im not entirely what you would call a &quot;metal head&quot; but i was really blown away when i finally watched this series. The characters are all very inspiring and entertaining to watch, the MC is one of the most outstanding characters in any anime iv&#039;e seen, watching him grow throughout the season and probably alot more in other season&#039;s. The races are just awesome, lots of dynamics and it really makes you feel as though your tuning to your favorite racing station and watching the real race cars attack the corners at every turn. The CGI i have to admit is a perfect contrast to really help portray the realistic vision of real street racing.<br />
<br />
I was actually turned onto to this anime by a friend of mine and i won&#039;t regret it, even though this is a very niche genre in the anime industry, initial D is a must watch for any advid fans who enjoy car racing or any fans for that matter who just like an enjoyable cast of characters, great musical sound tracks, and a well structured series from beginning to end.<br />

    This show is based exactly 1995 years after the birth of Jesus Christ, which I find a little odd since this number is very uncommon, but oh well.<br />
This is a sci-fi anime about racing in which we follow a bunch of street racers competing on the roads of futuristic tokyo. These racers use super advanced versions of old  japanese cars but don&#039;t let looks deceive you, these are heavily modified.<br />
The story is set particularly on the life of a boring teenager who&#039;s dad had his eyes removed in the first war against the incoming alien invasion. For this reason he decides to let his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review78351">
        son do the delivering in his homemade tofu business. (Yes, there is still tofu in the future)<br />
After sleeping inside his father&#039;s car for years in automatic mode, he realizes that under those hideous looks lies an amazingly powerful car made out of alien spaceship parts. That&#039;s when he decides to call it Herbie and ride it against other racers who then turn out to be aliens too planning to take over the world.<br />
He must then ride Herbie with his eyes closed because after sleeping so much in his car he doesnt need to see the road anymore and so he realizes that that&#039;s exactly why his dad never opens his eyes either and so after saving earth from aliens the truth is revealed that he is really his dad and he never actually had a dad.

    Initial D is a bit of a mixed bag. When it&#039;s actually focused on the races, the drivers,  and Takumi&#039;s developing interest in the sport, it becomes clear as to why its THE anime you go to for racing. It&#039;s enjoyable to see how Tak manages to outmaneuver his opponents in a slower car. The soundtrack is unique and iconic, and it complements the racing well. However, these highlights only comprise about half the show, and its the frequent detours into the slice-of-life/romance genre that really drag the show down for me.<br />
<br />
This is mainly referring to Itsuki and Iketani, two of Tak&#039;s friends and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345669">
        &quot;teammates&quot; in the show. There interactions in the show are bearable at best, and painfully annoying at worst. Won&#039;t spoil too heavily, but Iketani&#039;s romance arc is easily one of the most confusing I&#039;ve seen in all the anime I&#039;ve watched. There&#039;s also fact that neither of them ever participate in a race; or anyone on their team for that matter. It&#039;s only Tak, everyone other member is relegated to a cheerleading role.<br />
<br />
The other side characters, like Bunta and the other competitors, were mostly fine. It was interesting to see their motivations behind racing and their gameplans against Tak. <br />
<br />
To reiterate, this is basically the only relevant racing anime. The only other I&#039;ve seen at this point is Redline, and that&#039;s more of an action movie than anything. It&#039;s unfortunate the parts I found enjoyable don&#039;t make up the majority of the runtime, but regardless, I&#039;d still heavily recommend Initial D if your looking for a racing anime.
