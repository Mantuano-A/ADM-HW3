    ~THIS REVIEW COVERS PART 1 AND 2 AND MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS~ <br />
<br />
Welcome to the flavour of the season isekai where the mc gets randomly transferred to an unknown world, is super op for no reason, has super op allies just because to help him win every battle by default and also forgets about his previous life like it never happened at all. The show starts off as a popcorn feel good series where you turn off your brain while watching mindless action and people building things here and there like Minecraft, only to take a complete turn and fail miserably. With each passing season,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417624">
        it becomes more evident to me that the author is clueless on how to write a compelling story with thought-provoking themes mixed with dynamic characters and exciting world building. His interest lies solely in exposition dumping instead of showing us throughout the story, big flashy battles where characters shout their new epic moves, redundant dialogue and power ups left and right. What&#039;s worse is that he habitually tries to create fake tension and suspense, brimmed with shallow political aspects and surface level solutions to arising conflict. Repeatedly spending half of the arcs building up for the climax, but it isn&#039;t rewarding since we already know that Great Rimuru will win every battle by default and in a very uneventful fashion. Usually by pulling something out of his ass with no prior foreshadowing. <br />
<br />
The supporting cast, much like the mc are cookie cutters who do nothing but rave about how great Rimuru-sama is, as the Gary Stu faces no opposition nor repercussion. The one time he does face consequences however, leads to his friends&#039; demise. This creates an interesting twist which places him in a dichotomy. &quot;The opportunity of a lifetime for character development!&quot; I thought to myself. Though it seems that the author had other plans in mind, or rather, had no plans at all since he had no interest in prolonging this narrative. He only meant to use this pretentious hot garbage as a sorry excuse of a setup to give him more power ups. After that, he pretty much becomes Jesus and revives the dead. Rimuru has a walking plot device capable of doing anything when required: It creates portals when said to be almost impossible, extremely risky and demanding; It breaks 300 years seals in mere months; It gives life as it revives the dead as mentioned above; It averts clear limitations set on Treyni, a spiritual guardian bound to the forest by transferring her soul in another body like it&#039;s nothing; and it goes autopilot when Rimuru fails to defeat an enemy, which allows him to find ultimate victory with no casualties. This makes the show unbearable as there is no complexity to it. No threat, no tension, no stakes and no consequences. Raphael has a contingency plan for everything as it&#039;s a Batman belt in the literal sense strapped with gadgets we may only discover when the plot demands it. Breaking every rule set forth by its universe and making me wonder why said rules were even brought up in the first place. <br />
<br />
You would expect a production befitting the light novel&#039;s popularity as its sales consistently tops the category&#039;s charts yearly. Instead, we get a cash grab made of powerpoint presentations filled with excessive usage of still shots, visibly low budget CGI and subpar background art. I mean what did we achingly waste half of the season sleeping through the prologue for? It feels as though the animators emanate no sense of creativity in trying to bring the light novel to life with extremely uninspiring fight choreographies. They would rather spend the budget on the openings instead of the actual episodes. I mean A for marketing but F for the finishing product. This is uncharacteristic since light novels usually get good adaptions. Also, the villains are bland and look non-threatening. They evoke no intriguing motif, as they solely exist for the plot, to give Rimuru-sama enough reason to power up more than he needs to. They&#039;re your typical &quot;everybody looked down on me and now I&#039;m going to make everyone feel what I felt&quot; sadistic villains. The funny thing is so much time is spent building these villains up like they were going to be a big threat. Forming alliances with different kingdoms, reviving Veldora, putting strategies in place with constant meetings, but let&#039;s not lie to ourselves, we all knew that he would eventually become Rimuru&#039;s punching bag. I knew it, you knew, everybody knew it. The comedy is also pretty bad as it becomes repetitive overtime while heavily relying on all the common clichés that you find in anime, but this is entirely subjective to the individual. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, it was painful to watch this show. I tortured myself just to complete it near the end. He always wants to do what&#039;s right and always has his way eventually, despite how immoral or contradictory his actions may be and I&#039;m honestly just sick of it. I wish that isekai creators would put more effort into building up their world organically instead of always overly relying on the common tropes of power fantasies. The isekai genre is an interesting idea but is often so poorly executed into what would sell most, instead of what would make a decent story. <br />
<br />
In the end, this is just my opinion.

    The story of Great Rimuru-sama continues. Everyone planning to watch this season should already be familiar with the story and what has already occurred. Don&#039;t read further unless you&#039;ve watched previous seasons.<br />
<br />
But I&#039;ll show my kindness and give ya&#039;ll a short summarization. The second part of season two starts immediately where the first part ended. Rimuru is on a quest to get revenge for the attack that happened in the previous part. <br />
(You know, where a lot of villagers got &quot;killed&quot; and immediately resurrected because it&#039;s an unforgivable act to let characters die, according to the author.)<br />
<br />
However back to the genuine &quot;review&quot; if you could

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410207">
        even call it that, since the season is nowhere near finished at the point of writing this.<br />
But I actually enjoyed the first season, but I have to be honest and say it&#039;s really been a downfall for the series as a whole. When the story changed focus from trying to build up a village and its people. To instead switch the focus on becoming just another overpowered isekai protagonist with a personification of mashed potatoes endeavoring to be an edgelord, to preserve its poor people in an act of revenge. <br />
<br />
I can more or less guarantee that this season will be more heavily fixated on the action and the rivalries among the demon lords. It is safe to surmise more demon lords will get introduced and we&#039;ll learn more about them.<br />
<br />
Well, it&#039;s too early to really tell if it will succeed or not, however. I&#039;m starting to lose patience as I think the pacing has been really awful since the start of the season. But only time could tell if any of the problems I have with the show will get solved or complete the opposite and end as another generic isekai that didn&#039;t live up to its expectations.<br />
<br />
Do I recommend this season? Well, if you didn&#039;t like the first two seasons then I think this is the time to drop the series. But if you enjoyed the previous installments you should give it a try and watch it for yourself and form your own opinion.

    Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken, the most anticipated anime out of all in the heat of summer. The first half of the second season left us off with the appearance of the storm dragon, Veldora and also the newborn demon lord, Rimuru. I couldn’t wait to see both of them, and the day has finally come at last. <br />
<br />
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
In the second part, we’re introduced by a lot of interesting characters, but the one that stands out the most is Veldora. We got to know more about his traits. As an evil dragon himself, he is surprisingly active and funny, and it is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410179">
        mostly because of how immature he can be most of the time. Aside from Veldora, there’s another character that has been brought back from the first season, Yuuki Kagurazaka. I didn’t recognize him at a glance, but maybe some of you could recognise him immediately.  From what I recall, he was one of Shizue’s students. He will play an active role in the second half, and I’m excited to see what he is capable of doing later in the episode. <br />
<br />
The story will be very intriguing in the second part. We can expect a lot of fierce battles between nations and intense rivalry among demon lords. We will also get to meet the other demon lords other than Milim. The only ones that have been introduced so far are demon lord Valentine and former demon lord Kazaream. Valentine belongs to the Western Holy Church, so we can expect something compelling from him.<br />
<br />
I’m more than impressed to see how consistent 8-bit can be over the past few years. The animation, sound, vibes, and everything else is just like the old slime I cherish. Nothing has changed. I don’t see it as an understatement. I mean, why would you change something that’s already close to being perfect? Sure, there’s always room for improvement, but at this state, I find it hard to pick out the flaws to complain about. I could still be fond of slime up until now thanks to 8-bit, and that reason should be more than enough to give them all the praise. <br />
<br />
Slime gets 9 cookies out of 10.

    If there&#039;s one word to sum TenSura&#039;s 2nd Cour (or 2nd half) of Season 2, it would be &quot;Walpurgis&quot;. This part of the season literally exists because of the pandemic, from an in-between of a stopgap that is Spring&#039;s TenSura Nikki a.k.a The Slime Diaries, and A WHOLE LOT of waiting and kinda unnecessary tension build-up over the majority of the season just to have this part of the story blow up in the final stretch. Yeah, pacing issues as they say.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this will be the last time that we&#039;ll see TenSura on the small screen, so here&#039;s the highlights of this season being the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417616">
        sole Volume 6 of the LN in a full course dinner&#039;s worth of a complete package:<br />
- The appetizer: At the end of the 1st half of TenSura Season 2, Rimuru meets up with Veldora (in his storm dragon appearance), and they do the E.T. thing again, but this time, Veldora gets a major change of its character to change the landscape of the fantasy world in an abrupt turn to everyone&#039;s shock.<br />
- The entrée/main course: The man-and-monster summit between the Jura Tempest Federation and other allied kingdoms and nations. A fair bit of reconciliation and recreation firsthand, then the major analyses to discuss about Demon Lord Clayman&#039;s atrocities (and other factions a.k.a the Kingdom of Falmuth attached to it) which laid waste to Tempest incurring huge losses in the 1st half of Season 2.<br />
- The dessert: The final course that is the meeting of the Demon Lords, or &quot;Walpurgis&quot; to settle this conflict once and for all between Clayman and Rimuru, whom the latter has completed the Demon Lord ascension evolution in Part 1.<br />
<br />
Overall, Part 2 adds to the complements of Part 1 (that aired in Winter), just in the split-cour fashion because of the pandemic. Combine both parts together, and we the audience know how extensive the destruction of Tempest was brought about, and surpisingly, this whole incident we were led to believe that Clayman was the one behind all of this. But don&#039;t forget, there&#039;s the Master puppeteer that is Yuuki Kagurazaka&#039;s devious act of instigating a huge and significant conflict such as this, and this is just the beginning of this wayward intelligent and nihilistic enemy that was once tutored by Shizue before she passed away. It&#039;s just that I couldn&#039;t understand why it takes about more than half of the season (which are like 200-300 pages worth of content) to drag through one of the most hyped events in TenSura&#039;s anime to date.<br />
<br />
Everything&#039;s the same as of Part 1, but boy did 8-Bit pump it up in the action scenes. Sure, it&#039;s a tad above the quality seen when Tempest was at its destruction phases, but the age-old quote of &quot;saving the best for last&quot; applies here with the same and improved touché to go out with a bang. The supposedly last OST set is not what I will call memorable, but I can say that they&#039;re good songs at the very least. MindaRyn&#039;s 2nd featured Anisong &quot;Like Flames&quot; for this part&#039;s OP is a step above Kamitachi Otoko&#039;s ED, though they share similar vibes with the same outlandish vocols. Takuma Terashima has been a mainstay ever since TenSura&#039;s anime adaptation started back in 2018, and while this ED &quot;Reincarnate&quot; is IMO the worst of the songs he&#039;s performed for the series, every song of his has never sounded stale at the very least.<br />
<br />
If you like the previous installments, then this should be the same and vice versa if otherwise. Nuff said that we should all know TenSura by heart by now and before.

    *Sighs* It seems it&#039;s time to get Cancelled,<br />
<br />
Before calling me hater or edgelord let me throw in some background.<br />
<br />
<br />
I loved slime, I was the OG watcher of slime season 1 when it was trolled on by multiple  anitubers who believed it was gonna be a generic kirito clone isekai. I was still not talked out of it and watched it from start to finish.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then came season 2 part 1<br />
<br />
Even though it was not the same level of quality the hype that this season had bought me to tears this was the best underdog story to finally get its shine and Although i was let

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410183">
        down by the very significant  reason which I did mention in my review of season 2 part 1 - overloaded with way too many relevant characters with not enough screen time and I thought …….<br />
<br />
2)somehow cut the lesser relevant characters as background characters and provide a richer experience with the more relevant ones.  ---------december review<br />
<br />
<br />
I was wrong about that !<br />
<br />
Slime diaries Was the perfect solution. The sheer amount of lore and character interactions it had was mind blowing and it was a side series hence no one was gonna watch it and say … the series is getting way too slow or boring…. Since it&#039;s not the original story line anyway .<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And thus sprayquaza11 falls into the hype trap once again……<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When this season’s first episode aired it was an absolute hit i loved it and so did many others MAl ratings shot to 8.5 above and it looked like it was gonna be the best anime this season but then came the sloppy as fuck Diplomacy Parts that absolutely killed it for me .<br />
<br />
<br />
Season 2 part 1 <br />
1)The diplomacy was way better where king gazel and rimuru talks were exciting and rimuru took his own shortcomings seriously . <br />
2)Rimuru asserts his Rule and appears strong as a King must at all times  <br />
3)The demon lord clayman actually feels like a threat and.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Season 2 part 2<br />
1)Diplomacy = people of high authority and importance must clap for at least 30 seconds(to save animation budget ) after every important decision (which totally kills the seriousness of the decision) <br />
2)Rimuru Looks lost all the time either he acts like a child or gives his input like he s a puppet of the rest of his friends , he is either distracted half the time or just wants to fuck around.<br />
3)Rimuru has totally lost his KINGLy aura he just seems like a spoilt brat that just wants to get this all over with .<br />
4)More clapping <br />
5)leagues of many important characters not giving any input (the gob king , the oni prince , lizardmen prince etc) they are all basically one character at this point and i will call it the Rimuru-fan-club kun.No inputs no objections nothing whatsoever they only exist to make the room feel filled .<br />
<br />
<br />
Although i do agree,<br />
Rimuru used to  forgive too easily, making the less nice people get off the hook and setting the wrong example as a king multiple times by now(it was understandable as the orcs were under control). This is the only character development I have seen OF THE ONLY MAIN CHARACTER OF THE ENTIRE SERIES !<br />
<br />
<br />
I love slime but they just keep introducing more characters than they can handle ,at least kill some of them off? It builds some tension , makes the villain seem like he actually has a chance and may do something significant and in the long run , reduces the number of characters you have to draw and give a personality to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Can we seriously have a more serious and smart  diplomacy scene like the one with yuuki ? the villains seem to feel more likable at this point . they don&#039;t clap all the time either . <br />
<br />
<br />
AH yes stats time, i wrote a lot already so ,<br />
<br />
Plot - 9/10<br />
Characters- 2/10<br />
Animation and art- 8/10<br />
Voice acting- 10/10<br />
Overall 7/10<br />

    	If there’s one ingredient that’s absolutely core to my enjoyment of a show, it’s relatability. It’s not necessarily that the characters have to be similar to me, it’s that I have to connect with some facet of their motivation. Rimuru Tempest (which I will refer to as “he,” despite being genderless, for ease of discussion) was easily the most appealing aspect of this narrative as he’s a character we all wish we could be. What made him stand out from the myriad of lackluster self-inserts was his open-mindedness and uncanny ability to befriend those who were once enemies--mostly due to his exuberant generosity and resources--which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417619">
        allowed him to build a robust, ethnically diverse, RPG-esque community. It was fascinating to see all the moving parts of Tempest, how each individual can utilize their unique talents to contribute to their little society. Even if it’s all fictitious, there was a level of comfort in knowing that such a welcoming community exists where even a bumbling fool like Gobta has inherent value as a member. And while it has somewhat maintained this general appeal, I feel as though it has lost its luster over the course of Season 2. Spoilers ahead.<br />
<br />
There was a defining moment in Season 2 that dramatically shifted the dynamic of the narrative, and that was the Falmuth invasion. At first, I thought this was a good direction for the story to take. As the saying goes, you don’t know when something’s valuable until you’ve lost it, and witnessing the heartbreaking massacre on Tempest added some much-needed stakes to the story. It highlights just how fragile the city of Tempest can be, and it reinforces the idea that it’s something worth protecting. Such a loving community utterly devastated by humans, a race infamously known for their close-minded fear and ignorance. This can easily be seen as a metaphor for how minorities are often misunderstood and shunned because of it. The city of Tempest is truly the lifeline of the show, so it’s understandable that Rimuru would want to retaliate, but I feel as though he went too far. Up until this point, Rimuru kept that casualties to a minimum, only killing when absolutely necessary, so I was expecting the kind-hearted Rimuru to mourn the loss of his people, then try to establish a more sound relationship with the human race; this is a fantasy, after all, and I would like to believe people are actually able to be reasoned with, but the story took an unexpected turn. It introduced this cheap plot device where, if Rimuru evolves to Demon Lord, he can revive everyone who died in his city. Yea, you can kiss those stakes goodbye, ‘cuz from here on out, there will be none. <br />
<br />
There’s really no going back from this error. From now on, I know Rimuru will ALWAYS come out ahead no matter what, because the story can just pull something out of its ass to make sure of it. Throughout the show’s entirety, Rimuru’s powers and resources were handed to him on a silver platter, so I was genuinely interested to see how Rimuru would respond when things didn’t go his way, but of course, that doesn’t matter anymore. Yes, I understand that Slime is trying to be an escapist fantasy where everything goes right, but the invasion of Falmuth was an honest attempt at introducing a compelling conflict, and it fell flat because it’s trying to have its cake and eat it too. Needless to say, this has made Part 2 kinda boring...ish?<br />
	<br />
Funnily enough, despite having no narrative stakes, it didn’t totally ruin the experience for me. I guess watching Rimuru and co. is enough to simply enjoy the show, so it wasn’t a chore to sit through, but it definitely isn’t as charming as it used to be. I, personally, enjoy shows from a spectator’s point of view, and I seldom enjoy things that require self-insert. While most people might project themselves onto Rimuru to live out their fantasy, I simply admire Rimuru as if I’m a part of the community, but after seeing the oh-so-kind Rimuru slaughter thousands of humans, it’s hard to appreciate him in the same light. Sure, he did slaughter hundreds of orcs in the previous season, but this time, he did it with this eerie sense of malice to him. It almost feels as though he’s this communist overlord coated with a veneer of humble benevolence and prosperity. I dunno, it’s kind of unsettling to see all of his subordinates obsequiously worship him with this unquestionable loyalty, and when someone does question Rimuru, he just responds with: “I want to make the world a better place!” and everyone is just like: “wow, Rimuru, you’re such a nice guy!” and I’m here like “dude, you just killed thousands of people in cold blood, who’s making their world a better place?” It’s hard to relate to all the characters who are doing nothing but blindly jerking off Rimuru, and it’s even harder to relate to the slime king who can do no wrong. Because the show has lost that relatability, the show just isn’t as engaging as it used to be. Now, the character interactions aren’t nearly as endearing and actually slightly obnoxious. The fight scenes have become overlong and exhausting. It’s well animated, but it’s just a bunch of badass wannabes standing around announcing meaningless attack names and doing some flashy nonsense, and the dreadfully loud, bassy sound effects make it especially nauseating to sit through. These are ultimately small, nitpicky details, but they do add up and take away from the experience. <br />
<br />
I should also mention, Slime has had a villain problem for a while now where their only motivation is that they’re evil, but Part 2 has exacerbated this issue. Clayman was the “big bad” the show’s been building up to for a long while now. Every conflict before now alludes to him being the guy pulling the strings, and now that we actually see him in action, it turns out he’s actually quite cartoonish and pathetic. It’s as if reviving half the population wasn’t enough, and they just had to hammer home the fact that this show has absolutely zero tension. Oh wait, but Clayman isn’t actually the guy pulling the strings, turns out there’s a guy above him who’s the REAL villain! Oh boy, I can’t wait to see that confrontation, isn’t it exciting? No. No, it’s not. Remember back in 2012, everyone was freaking out about Thanos in the Avengers mid-credit scene? Yea, that was a cool reveal because Loki was already a cunning, world-ending threat. I suppose Clayman is the Loki of this universe, but this shouty dumbass is laughable at best and pompously overbearing at his worst. Seriously, this is just a pitiful attempt at raising the stakes where there is none, since Rimuru is so OP that he’ll probably just brush off the next villain with ease anyways.<br />
<br />
I know I’ve been pretty negative throughout this review, but I still kind of enjoy the show despite all of its flaws. I wish I could just ignore these thoughts and experience the show for what it is, but alas, these things do indeed distract me. Like I said before, building the city of Tempest was what I found to be the most enticing aspect of the show, and I guess at some point, the show stopped being about the community and solely about Rimuru. Everyone either praises him or is impressed by him. We get a scene where 2 big bad demon lords talk about how mysterious and fascinating Rimuru is. In every fight scene, we have people shouting out how cool he is, and that kind of excessive stanning is lost on me.<br />

    Everyone’s lord and saviour Rimuru-sama has returned yet again, and this entry of Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken continues to be enjoyable despite its overall lack of narrative stakes. The characters remain just as entertaining to watch and help deliver on a well-timed arc that many previous fans of the series were most likely waiting for. Fans of the series know what to expect by now and this season makes sure not to disappoint them. Unfortunately for others who weren’t as keen on the previous seasons, many major issues remain as the show continues to play into its strengths rather than improve upon its weaknesses.<br />
<br />
This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417617">
        entry of Tensei Shitara knows it’s largest audience well. We get to see more one-sided battles from our carefree, overpowered protagonist, Rimuru, while all his friends are off engaging in their own rather insignificant battles. Under most circumstances the repeated lack of stakes would’ve resulted in a stale or boring story, however, Tensei Shitara manages to weasel its way out of any feeling of repetition through entertaining characters and a story structure that keeps you engaged. Plot points hinted at in previous seasons are delivered on and more plot points are set up for future developments. It keeps fans wanting more while making sure the current arc is interesting, and this continues to pay off greatly as the show progresses. There are numerous obstacles and antagonists, new and old, so don’t expect it to run out of ideas anytime soon.<br />
<br />
This season focuses a lot more on the demon lords, Clayman and his army in particular, and it was a good change of pace that resolved many issues brought in in previous arcs. It’s properly built up with numerous scenes of Clayman that allow the viewer to have become familiar with him as an antagonist by the end of the season. He can be pretty underwhelming at times though, and a more competent villain would’ve been much better for the series. This gets more evident the more the season progresses. The arc is wrapped up nicely in the twelve episodes though, with a satisfying conclusion to all the plot points it tackled. Other demon lords are also introduced, with some maintaining an aura of uncertainty around them adding a slight layer of unpredictability to the story.<br />
<br />
The exceptionally large number of characters continues to increase whilst quite honestly being one of the few things keeping the anime from dropping in entertainment value. You can expect to see previously introduced characters return, each one of them adding to the story in some way. Multiple new characters are introduced to set up for future arcs and there are only a select few characters introduced that seem to add no real value to the story whatsoever. At some points the number of characters can seem too large, with the series struggling to give enough screentime to them all. It’s forced to throw in a few random battles to make sure every character is doing something. While the fights were still entertaining to watch they can feel rather meaningless when looking back on the season as a whole.<br />
<br />
Although the large cast of characters keep on providing a fun and refreshing feel to the show there is still a noticeable lack of proper character development. All the major events that happen seem to barely phase any characters involved and by the end of the season they’re practically the same people they were at the beginning of it. Every event and battle just happens to play out in a way that leaves every character in great condition by the end of it. The events of Part One practically confirmed that you won’t have to worry about anything bad happening to the characters. Character development was never a goal for this series, this has been obvious since the first season, and it continues to prioritise fun and entertaining characters over more thought-out ones.<br />
<br />
Tensei Shitara has always had a slight focus on fantasy politics and this is now true more than ever. It makes sure you know this as well, with multiple episodes in a row being dedicated to having the characters sit in a circle and talk about… something. I’m not going to try and convince you that the political aspects of this season are particularly well thought out or complicated when they honestly aren’t. However, I can say that it was surprisingly easy to follow and digest, and the characters and dialogue made sure it never felt like it was wasting my time. There were genuinely comedic moments thrown in that helped stop making any long scenes of exposition from becoming uninteresting. Things like the relationships and conflicts between nations are explained well through dialogue rather than a narrator, which is just one small thing the series does that increases my appreciation for it. Tensei Slime never tries to be a complicated story and is able to clearly explain its world to the audience thanks to this.<br />
<br />
Visuals-wise the series maintains the quality seen in previous seasons. The animation gets the job done, with fight scenes being neither great nor bad. All the different races occasionally provide unique fight scenes that I think the animators do a fine job of showcasing. Some outfit changes such as Rimuru’s now all-black clothes added a sense of individuality to the season which was nice. The soundtrack was decent enough and went along well with whatever was taking place in the scene. Various sound effects stood out during fight scenes, for example certain abilities would leave a lasting impression thanks to the booming audio that went with them. The opening was great, standing out from previous ones it’s with English lyrics, something that is always refreshing to see.<br />
<br />
Anyone who’s seen previous seasons knows what to expect by now. This season of Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken show manages to meet expectations while delivering on an arc that has been built up in previous seasons, giving more of the same without the story ever dropping off in quality. It’s still a power fantasy through and through, but it’s still an entertaining one in the end.<br />

    I thoroughly enjoyed the first season in all honesty, the action, development of characters and in general the overall experience was very enjoyable, but as far as the quality of this series goes, much like Tokyo Ghoul, the following seasons have been a letdown. <br />
<br />
Firstly, the animation:<br />
<br />
Previously, in my opinion, the animation was very good; fluid, attentive to detail and generally effectively communicated the amount of effort that Eight Bit had put in this anime. However, second season animation was reduced to a seemingly PowerPoint-style (not as bad as the way of the house husband), with a plethora of static scenes, a monocoloured background that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410301">
        lacked detail, minimising the amount of enjoyment viewers can attain. <br />
<br />
Secondly, the content:<br />
<br />
Scenes are unnecessarily drawn out. This could be seen in the early parts of season 2 part 1 where dialogue was added seemingly just to fill the episode quota, resulting in it lasting an unnecessary amount of episodes that could have been action, USEFUL CONTENT and actual character development. An example of this (which was repeated throughout season 2) was the absurd number of cuts to show EVERYONE&#039;s reaction towards what Rimuru said. These reactions were also just static images, void of any actual meaning and emotion that lasted too many seconds. Like, I know, Rimuru is cool and all but we already know that having a 20-second segment just consisting of constant cuts and pans of static images isn&#039;t necessary but instead feels like Eight Bit wanting to fill episode durations. Instead, you could&#039;ve had Rimuru or anyone doing something, displaying that wow factor rather than boring images that really don&#039;t connect with viewers.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, character development: <br />
<br />
Who remembers the heroes? Because frankly, I don&#039;t. The building &#039;tension&#039; that producers were aiming for simply fell out in this season. Instead of showing that they were vicious, evil and greedy, what was communicated was instead a group of psychopathic clowns, typical in those B grade animes or even Hentai antagonists. Overall, I am saying that they missed the mark for this and by a fair margin. But the voice actors were quite good in communicating their clown-like behaviours, if only it was intended. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, this season has so far been quite a letdown, beginning with a 4 episode streak of them just nodding and being &quot;shocked&quot; at the meeting providing nothing really constructive or worthwhile for the viewers. However, despite this people will still rate it a &gt;8 which is an overstatement, but people will still watch because of their trash taste such as myself, with the market being saturated by isekais I guess this is somewhat decent. However, I would argue that people are merely holding on with faith that this season will be better and hence giving it a 9 saying that it has great potential despite watching a group of demi-humans and monsters just nodding for 4 episodes straight. <br />
<br />
Congrats, you have fooled yourself. <br />
<br />
Stop lingering to the glorious past and be real with yourself, is this really a &gt;8, or really just a 5-7.<br />
<br />

    TLDR; I don&#039;t like the second part of season 2. A ton of build up for nothing. <br />
<br />
I was insanely hyped after the first part of season 2. After slime boy became a Demon Lord, I thought, man its all up from here. I guess I was wrong.<br />
<br />
From reading the comment sections and stuff the best parts people like is how absolutely ridiculous, characters act in serious moments, aka the comedy (I&#039;m looking at you Veldora). I assumed, from the general tone of the first season and the first part of the second season that this wasn&#039;t going to be a comedy anime. It has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416646">
        some funny moments sure but thankfully it never felt like the main objective of any episode.  This &quot;part&quot; however has been boring and has had an extreme focus on comedy. I enjoyed the lighthearted nature of season 1 and having that escalate into a dark showdown of revenge was extremely compelling.  However.....nothing.<br />
<br />
The story feels boring, the characters feel boring, the scenes that are supposed to be epic, intense, and heart wrenching...boring. All the emotion that was built up at the end of season one and season 2 part one has been lost. I don&#039;t mind having a super OP main character, if you at least make a villain of similar strength. Something that still gives the fight meaning even though u know the MC is going to win anyways.  <br />
<br />
For me this second part was a huge step down and I feel like I&#039;ve wasted my time. I can only hope the final episode provides a little bit of satisfaction and maybe next season improves/goes back to the more serious tone with only small bits of humor thrown in. Honestly this &quot;part&quot; feels like they got stuck in writing the Slime Diaries and forgot to stop.

    So i came into this series as a big fan and i&#039;m leaving as someone who is completely done with Tensura, i&#039;ll never read the novels, never rewatch any of the anime and while i managed to finish episode 11 to watch even one more episode is just too much to ask.<br />
<br />
And here the problem: This series is a absolute pisstake!<br />
<br />
Now the main issue, as others have mentioned, is the first 6 episodes are just filled with nothing but talking (the majority of which is all done in just one location and by just one group of people). But what others have failed to mention

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416642">
        (at least the reviews i&#039;ve read) is that the talking done within the first 4 episodes is exclusively about things we already know! 4 episodes, FOUR, are basically used as the catch up for what happened in the previous half of this season!<br />
<br />
Episodes 5 and 6 at least go into new territory with their talking (discussing what&#039;s going to happen rather than what has happened) but by that point all the good will and excitement that i had from the previous half of this season had been completely destroyed and i simply could not bring myself to care!<br />
<br />
This was all compounded by the fact that the show continues to insist on using every opportunity it can to unleash it&#039;s tired and cliched &quot;jokes&quot; upon us. I&#039;ve never found Tensura&#039;s comedy funny, cause i&#039;ve seen it all so many times before, but i never minded until now when it feels so much like they&#039;re just doing it to waste our time.<br />
<br />
On top of all of this is the continuing problem that none of the characters (outside of Rimuru himself) receive any kind of development or even possess any actual depth to them. The cast continues to be the very same one note characters they were when we were first introduced to them. Now this issue is exasperated by the fact that the cast is huge so most of them get little time on screen and are largely left uninvolved in things. But this issue is particularly galling when the show decides to waste at least 4 episodes telling you what you already know when they could&#039;ve instead explored some of these characters or given them something to actually do other than make lame cliched jokes!<br />
<br />
Finally Rimuru himself has suffered from a sort of character assassination this season. The tension of events is supposed to be high and very serious (his city was attacked, many of his friends killed, they&#039;re all going to war, he himself is going to face off against his opponent as well as numerous powerful individuals who may decide to kill him) and yet he doesn&#039;t seem to care. He&#039;s just arsing around makin&#039; terrible jokes, laughing off important developments, ignoring warnings, behaving inappropriately in front of foreign delegates, and basically treating the entire thing (and world) like he&#039;s a kid and it&#039;s some sort of game. Gone is the character which, tho unsure of himself at times, you could believe to be an inspiring and competent ruler. Heck during the main confrontation he even goes so far as to interrupt and ignore Raphael, his greatest and most critical tool, 3 times despite the severity of the consequences should he fail!<br />
<br />
And it&#039;s that that&#039;s made me quit Tensura entirely. No longer is the main character someone i&#039;m interested in who i want to see succeed. Rather he has become the instrument that tells me that none of this matters, that the events unfolding are meaningless, that the characters around him aren&#039;t worth caring about, and that the world itself is just a worthless waste of time. Cause if he doesn&#039;t care enough to take it seriously when it should matter why should i?<br />
<br />
Well it was that and the first 4 episodes... what the heck were they thinking a FOUR EPISODE RECAP?!!!

    Tensura Season 2 Part 1 went out on a relatively high note, and the hype for the continuation was real. This was my most anticipated summer anime of 2021. <br />
<br />
I am in shock and awe over what a disappointment it’s been.<br />
<br />
Story: 1/10<br />
<br />
At the end of S2P1, it was clear that Rimuru would be spending the next arc taking down the antagonist, Clayman. The stage is set for an epic war between demon lords. Episode one rolls around, and the entirety is spent with the main, supporting, and minor characters talking it out. Okay, fair enough, it is the first episode, so it’s alright to spend

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417696">
        it setting up the epic action teased to come.<br />
<br />
Then the second episode’s credits roll, and wouldn’t you know it, Rimuru and his pals are still talking it out in Tempest.<br />
<br />
Then the third episode’s credits roll… and the fourth’s…<br />
<br />
Wouldn’t you know it, we’re six entire episodes in and there has been no demon lord showdown as promised, but a whole lot of talking heads. If I wasn’t already three cours into this show, it would be an easy drop for this absolute travesty of pacing alone.<br />
<br />
Action finally starts with the seventh episode, but it amounts to little more than dick-measuring contests of power levels. No threat Rimuru’s underlings face are enough to create even an in-universe sense of urgency. As viewers, that’s one thing, but when the characters themselves show this level of apathy, why are we watching them? It’s the story equivalent of beating the stuffing out of early-game enemies after beating the final boss of a video game… but for entire episodes. It’s as senseless as it is boring.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Rimuru… what in the actual nine circles of hell was that Clayman fight? Episode ten ends with getting our hopes up with the promise of finally(!!) delivering the epic Clayman fight we were promised, and then the writing comes in and smashes the tiny strand of tension the narrative had finally managed to build up in favor of an episode worth of braindead sitcom gags that have no place in the middle of any fight sequence, much less to the death. This is paired with one of the dumbest plot reveals I’ve ever seen in my anime-watching career. Tension looks like it’s going to come back… and then evaporates moments later, rinse and repeat for as long as the airtime needs to fill the time slot. The sheer audacity of this entire trainwreck of bad writing is enough to put Tensura S2P2 alongside the very worst dregs of cheap cash-grabbing isekai properties.<br />
<br />
Art: 3/10<br />
<br />
I can’t in good conscience give the art anything high when so much of the show has been the cast sitting around and talking with the enthusiasm of a cold bologna sandwich. While no animation jumps out as janky or mismatched, I know what Tensura is capable of showing us, and so I can’t help but be disappointed. <br />
<br />
At this point, the new character designs a have lost their charm as well. No more monsters for us, part of the selling point of the original imho, just generic mass-produced bishonen and bland waifus. The demon lords could have been really cool, but instead they have been designed as generically attractive human(oid)s in generic outfits designed to market sex appeal. It’s disappointing that this once-beloved anime has fallen so low.<br />
<br />
Sakuga might have made Tensura worth watching despite the atrocious state of its story. Unfortunately, there is very little, if any. Even the fight scenes somehow feel as comparatively devoid of life as the strategy room scenes. The best sakuga is found in the OP and ED sequences; speaking of which, why the slight updates halfway through the show? It’s not like it was particularly spoilery, so was it just not animated in time for the release, or what?<br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10<br />
<br />
The OP and ED are okay. The rest of the soundtrack is nothing to write home about. The voice acting is hammy, but not as horrible as the other aspects of this show. Actors can only do so much with the script they’re given, after all. In that regard, the VAs are the most impressive aspect of the show. Thanks for trying, VAs, but you couldn’t save this one.<br />
<br />
Character: 1/10<br />
<br />
The cast has undergone sitcom-ification. The script has never been Tensura’s strong suit. With a dearth of action scenes, any potential character of Rimuru’s posse has been killed in favor of unfunny jokes and tired cliches. Veldora suffers from this the worst, going from an intimidating dragon of few words to an insufferable buff bishie who’s about as intimidating as any character whose purpose is to be the butt of jokes.<br />
<br />
Clayman, the villain, is basically Baby’s First Antagonist. He’s as one dimensional as they come. Considering the arc focus is supposed to be between him and Rimuru, it’s extremely disappointing. If we have to be stuck in talking-head limbo, why not explore his motivations beyond being an evil, power-grabbing stereotype? <br />
<br />
Clayman is so transparently evil, arrogant, and abrasive to everyone(!) that it makes one wonder why none of the other demon lords have put him in his place. He feels like the author tried to evoke Roswaal from Re:Zero on a surface level, without the love and care that made Roswaal a compelling character. After being hyped up as an antagonist for so long, calling this a disappointment is an understatement.<br />
<br />
The other demon lords come off as a mix of arrogant as well as dumber than a sack of rocks, which is a combination of traits as odd as it is infuriating to watch for characters that are supposedly the cream of the crop. It comes off not as regal or powerful, but as an attempt to make the lowest common denominator of the audience feel smart. It’s hard to have respect for them as characters.<br />
<br />
Seriously, Tensura… it’s been a while since I’ve been so uninvested in a major faction reveal of all things. Not a single new demon lord is worth singling out to write about. There’s a certain level of horrid writing you have to reach to kill that kind of natural hype.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the original Tensura immensely. It has a charm to it that I still believe sets it apart from your mixed bag of the seemingly endless amount of Isekai anime series churned out every seasonal cour, copycatting each other in an ouroboros of bad writing. S2P1 departed from the feel-good vibe of the original season in favor of edge, yet for all its controversy, I found it to be a strong enough and satisfying sequel.<br />
<br />
This one, though…<br />
<br />
I knew Tensura jumped the shark the moment Veldora began guffawing at manga in what was otherwise a high-profile political meeting, but I was determined to see it through to the end. Despite this, I couldn’t have anticipated how much worse the show got. I expected the show to throw me a bone, a reason to keep watching besides the sunken costs of having watched the earlier seasons. It never happened.<br />
<br />
Regarding any potential future seasons of Tensura, I would much rather watch an obvious bargain bin isekai anime where things actually happen than listen to the Rimuru Simp Squad kiss ass to their idol with just enough drip-feeding of plot to bait me into watching again next week, only to be let down again by more sitting and talking, a smattering of unhumorous, forced gags, and maybe watch someone gloat about their power levels if we’re lucky.<br />
<br />
If you enjoyed the previous Tensura seasons, do yourself a favor and pretend like S2P1 was the series finale and S2P2 never got funded.<br />
<br />
If that isn’t enough to stop you, at least turn it into a drinking game. Maybe the alcohol will help wash the bad taste of the writing out of your mouth.<br />
<br />
Overall, 2 out of 10.

    Let&#039;s raise the bar a little bit and make the silent majority talk shall we ? Because yes, even if poor reviews are throning because a few hundreds people found them hopeful, you know that&#039;s it&#039;s one of the best if not the best part of Slime Tensei just watching at the score and the number of people voting (exactly the same thing with part 1 btw)<br />
<br />
Story 10 : You give people a few episodes of world building and settlement at the beginning of a season and everyone is ready to go whine on MAL, that&#039;s crazy. <br />
<br />
Yes the meetings are stretched and could have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416366">
        been a little bit shorter, but it&#039;s a primordial part of Slime Tensei. If you watch Slime Tensei because of its fighting scenes and its &quot;shonen&quot; like battles, then you should probably STOP watching Slime Tensei. Because ST is a political anime first and foremost. Most of the LN is about Rimuru working his way to build a country that has his ideals. And to do that, he needs to develop his country and manage its international relations. To be honest, it&#039;s the focus of the LN and the battles and war are just a way of developing that part of the story (the country&#039;s building). <br />
<br />
So the first part of the season that so many people found annoying is arguably the most important one. And you will see the fruit of that building in the next seasons. Because believe me, there will be more seasons, when you animate such a good story, people are asking for more and it&#039;s normal. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m pretty sure those whines come from Anime only or Manga only reader, as an LN reader I really appreciated spending time on those meeting because every meeting there is is at the center of a major political change in ST&#039;s world. I even thought they didn&#039;t spend time on some part that were quite important, in the LN we are clearly said &quot;it was the first meeting of what would be known as the jura tempest coalition&quot; or something like that, I don&#039;t have the LN open, but believe me this coalition is a focus point in the next part of the story.<br />
<br />
Art 8 : The art is still great, I like how the battles are animated. The quality is a bit poor but I feel like the LN (maybe the manga too but I don&#039;t read it) is quite respected in the way the battles are animated as it&#039;s quite close the way I imagined them when I was reading the LN. <br />
<br />
Sound 10 : We stay on typical Slime OSTs which are bangers, let&#039;s not lie to ourselves. Whether it&#039;s battles, comedy or drama/sad theme, the OST is on point and is really pleasing to the ear. Especially the Warpurgis meeting opening OST, what a blast that was, I wish I listened to that when I was reading it. OP is a banger, ED is not my jam but it&#039;s still cool to listen.<br />
<br />
Character 10 : <br />
<br />
Honestly, that&#039;s the most unfair judgement I saw here. Anybody that says there is no Character development just because they are still depending on Rimuru, that&#039;s the dumbest thing ever.<br />
<br />
Rimuru is their leader and is OP, of course he will stay as the center of the anime, that&#039;s pretty much why the f-ing anime is called &quot;Slime Tensei&quot; isn&#039;t it ? Does it mean there are no character development though ? <br />
<br />
What about Shuna ? I&#039;m not gonna spoil in this review so I can&#039;t go into details but is she still the sheltered princess she was at the beginning of the show ? <br />
What about Benimaru ? Is he still the same bull who burns everything on sight without thinking ? <br />
What about Gobta ? Is he still a little kid without any part in the story ? <br />
What about Shion ? Is she the same as before adoring Rimuru and just acting crazy for him ? (Ok maybe she is still the same after all ;p)<br />
<br />
But let&#039;s talk seriously here. The character development is one of the best I&#039;ve seen. The character develops themselves at a steady pace, yes they won&#039;t change overnight because it wouldn&#039;t be f-ing logical. Nobody changes overnight. But little by little you can see them change in the way they act and in the decision they take. Because Rimuru is still the leader, but the side cast has a lot free room to act based on their own decision, in this second part and in part 1 as well. That&#039;s where you see their development.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, the author also makes them grow into a more compact community. You can see in this second season a much more improved way of co existing between species. A new way of living in this new city/country that is Rimuru. That&#039;s what Rimuru has in mind for his country, and that developed as well since season 1. We have culture exchange, different species helping each others, development of school, shops, military, etc. That&#039;s in the department of world building but also character development, how they act in community. <br />
<br />
But like for people who are rating this part so low, I&#039;m betting character development for them is just a character that is ruthless becoming a little bit nicer in the next episode or some stuff like that. Character Development needs to be discrete and seemingly natural for it to be efficient. You need to feel like the characters are growing without seeing it and I believe this show makes a great work on that. Because it respects the LN on that point (even if it omits some important stuff) and that&#039;s why it&#039;s quality.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; Overall 10 :<br />
<br />
Look, I just wanted to post a review because I&#039;m disgusted by the bad ratings which are only in a small number but are highlighted unfortunately. This season is straight fire. I say it and I stand by it, the second season is better than the first one. And as an LN reader I can tell you right now, if they continue like that, the third season will be the best also. Because Slime Tensei story is only getting better. <br />
<br />
So yeah, if you read those reviews to know if you should watch it or not, you will MISS OUT if you don&#039;t watch it, cause it&#039;s simply one of the GOATs. At least anybody who has been watching anime for a long time knows that Slime Tensei is part of the discussion.

the first season was amazing like really amazing. the second was a little

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415038">
        sad but it was so good. and i have read alot of reviews where people dont like overpowered characters, but i so love this, and i so love overpowered main character, almost all the isekai overpowered main character shows are in my favorite list. and i cant get enough of them i wish people started making this stuff about 10 or so years ago. then we would have so much amazing stuff, not that the shows made arn&#039;t amazing and good. but isekai plus overpowered is just the best. and recently alot of shows are coming out with this theme and i so love it.<br />
<br />
thanks a whole lot.

    Half of season is boring, full with bla bla bla talk that they could use like 2 episodes for this but no they have to use half of it or more.<br />
They could make OVA for this boring episodes. but no we have to know every characters what they think.<br />
It is in manga we have to give it full episodes for pointless talk because the producer dont know how to make a anime episode.<br />
It is not worth the money for subscription.<br />
Episode 6 have interesting things but first 5 are pointless.<br />
If i wanted to see diplomacy and things like that i have tv that i dont know

    Keeping this quick. If you&#039;re watching this you know the story up to this point and I&#039;m not going to spoil anything.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re reading this after the season is over, completely forget about everything said below and just binge the entire season already, what are you waiting for?<br />
<br />
This story keeps getting more and more hype every episode, the only issue is the pacing. It&#039;s both good and bad. There is a lot of world building that had to be done this season as Rimuru ventures more outside of his own forest so because of that there is a lot of talking. This is ultimately good

          <span style="display: none;" id="review413605">
        for the story but it feels like a bit of a c*ck tease seeing as we know there are awesome events and battles coming near the end of the season. It&#039;s not bad it&#039;s just agonizing to wait every week.

    Very good anime. I consider myself to be new to anime, and this one has been one the much better ones I have seen so far. I never find myself bored with any winding plot points. Art is quite good, some very compelling art at times and at worst it&#039;s simple and doesn&#039;t take away from the scene. Characters are probably the best part of the show, although some of the villains feel more like caricatures (which is intended to some extent without spoiling anything). I would rate this as a 8.5, but Geld is so awesome that it brings it to a 9. If

    Might seem like a biased rating becuase i love this anime...<br />
<br />
Been with the series since Season 1 and i&#039;ve loved every part of it, Story is pretty good, Artwork is very pleasing and nice to look at, especially those intense magic moments, and the sounds... The sounds are the best in my opinion... <br />
<br />
So far the sounds have me feel like i was right next to the caster, The sounds make everything magic related in this Anime even better... There not too in your ear but neither feel too far away...<br />
<br />
With regards to characters, Love the Characters and Character Design and love watching the characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415348">
        do there thing, especially rimaru, its also nice to see how the characters work together...<br />
<br />
Overall is a enjoyable Anime for me... Every aspect of it to me makes this anime a fun one to watch and listen too, Its nice watching Rimaru move on up in the world along with his family!

    The manga made the talk heavy parts more interesting. <br />
<br />
The anime is just exhausting to watch.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t dislike anime with lots of planning and thinking ahead, but the exposition in this season is handled lazy and uninteresting. <br />
<br />
They could at least try animate some parts of the things they are talking about to justify this being an anime adaptation, but it&#039;s just some guys sitting in a circle talking with each other.<br />
<br />
As LN this works out fine, but if you just try to copy what was written there and don&#039;t add some scenes for the anime, whats the point of having an anime?<br />
<br />
Read the manga

Some examples of talk heavy anime that are actually interesting.<br />
<br />
LoGH<br />
<br />
Death Note<br />
<br />
Kaguya-sama Love is War (This sounds like a troll compared to the other two anime, but most action in this series is the main characters talking to themselves)<br />

    Getting boring.<br />
<br />
First season was good and I really enjoyed it for what it was, but this season just keeps getting more and more boring. Can&#039;t get into specifics because of spoilers but I don&#039;t think that it really matters.<br />
<br />
Part 1 of this (2nd) season was alright even though I found it to be a bit sloppy and lacking in some aspects but part 2 has just been getting worse and worse. The characters for one, don&#039;t feel real enough and some of the new characters that have been introduced aren&#039;t nearly as interesting as you would have hoped -and that includes some of the more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415236">
        important characters. I don&#039;t mind the comedy bits even if they&#039;re a little cheesy but they do take away a lot from the personality of the characters because they keep making everyone look stupid and unrealistic during parts that I feel should be more serious. Then we also have some of the scenarios. A large part of the 2nd half for this season has been the characters just talking and planning. I don&#039;t mind that even though it&#039;s part of why I found it to be getting more and more boring but it definitely feels like they have been stalling for some reason. One of the fights during the 2nd half of this 2nd part of this 2nd season felt really unimportant and underwhelming and I can&#039;t really explain why but Rimuru could&#039;ve literally finished it all in 10 seconds and still have more than enough time to do other stuff.<br />
<br />
Even though I&#039;ve only watched 9 episodes thus far, I give it an overall score of 5. Might change my mind later depending on how the last few episodes go, but as of now I am not satisfied.

    In my opinion the first few episodes of the 2nd Season Part 2 is going much better than part 1 where i felt that the creators were rushing it a bit. In the last season i found that only the final 3-4 episodes were in a good  quality. <br />
<br />
This time i feel that they are taking their trying to give the best possible work. They are putting up the story in a detailed manner and the quality over all has increased greatly and hoping that they will continue to do the same with the rest . <br />
<br />
Right now i have put a 7 rating

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410191">
        as i want to see how they will pull of this arc in the end and will change it accordingly.I hope they will be able to put every detail as much as possible in accordance to the light novel and hope that they do not end this series after this arc.
