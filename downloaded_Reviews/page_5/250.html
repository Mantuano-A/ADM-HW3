But 7 episodes in and this show is full of snail-like pacing, poor attempts at inciting emotions, misplaced humor and one of the most aggravating, useless MC&#039;s.<br />
<br />
The first problem with Tokyo Revengers lies in its unbelievable representation of middle schoolers. You just can&#039;t look me in the eye and say these guys are meant to be 14-15 year olds - Draken, Osanai, Pah, Kiyomizu and a majority of the gangs would be better suited to play their characters&#039; dads here. Of course, inaccurate age depictions are no stranger in the world of anime, but this is one of the worst cases I&#039;ve seen of it by far because its existence constantly detracts from my enjoyment of the plot. I can imagine the story playing out so much better in the context of high school &quot;yankii&quot; instead, with the potential to go even darker, albeit more realistically.<br />
<br />
Sadly, it doesn&#039;t stop there. The second biggest problem that holds this show back is its ridiculous premise to begin with. The unique concept of time travel portrayed here deserves some praise, but it fails to be interesting when our two genius protagonists, Takemichi and Naoto, go out of their way to pick the most complex solution to their problem. One can conjure up numerous better ways to save Hinata, but no, the stakes must forced to be unneccesarily high or where would our entire plot and character development be? Speaking of the latter, it&#039;s pretty clear from the start that Takemichi&#039;s goal as a character is to learn from his regrets and become a better person but damn, if we haven&#039;t seen that one before. There is absolutely no redeeming factor or quality to keep me invested in his character (rather difficult when the MC just cries every episode) or anything that happens to anyone around him, really. And NO, to anyone claiming this is a good example of a &quot;multidimensional emotionally in touch with himself&quot; character, please go watch some josei to see what that looks like. Simply put, it&#039;s all just so BORING and predictable. Yes, even the &quot;plot twists&quot; which is where the dramatic soap opera vibes come in. Also, has no one stopped to question how fucking weird it is for someone who&#039;s mentally 26 to be crushing on a 14-year old girl? As someone who&#039;s normally a sucker for romances, this just isn&#039;t it.<br />
<br />
If all of that wasn&#039;t already enough to put me off, we have our final cherry on top: the art style. For a lot of anime that suffer from poor storylines and characters, the animation is something to fall back to as its saving grace. Not the case here at all. From the very first episode, there&#039;s just something about the cartoonish character designs that turns me off, regardless of the warped sense of age. What&#039;s worse is that it had the potential to be so much better; the manga&#039;s art style is far superior here and perhaps, it is better off consumed in that medium. But hey, I guess we got a pretty decent OP and ED out of this adaptation at least?<br />
<br />
It may not seem like it, but believe me when I say I really wanted to like this show. With all the hype it&#039;s been receiving since its release, my curiosity was piqued, but all that&#039;s left to be found here is an unrealistic, uninteresting and underwhelming story ft. aesthetically displeasing cardboard characters.

    Déjà vu.<br />
<br />
The dictionary tells us déjà vu is an unpleasantly familiar feeling. Tokyo Revengers made me feel déjà vu because it is the latest of many overhyped shounen adaptations with nothing to offer except for animation. But this adaptation of a multimillion-dollar franchise has the unbelievable audacity to look like it was animated on a shoe-string budget in the early 2000s. Its utterly unremarkable story about middle school gang wars is only worsened by sluggish pacing and ugly art.<br />
<br />
Two middle school gangs wrapped in a turf war lead to the murder of an innocent person—one man has the power to prevent it all. Takamichi is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417154">
        a 26-year-old loser with no future. After finding out his middle school crush died in a car crash, he’s given a chance to challenge fate. Mysteriously, Takamichi is granted time travel abilities. He to a fixed period, 12 years ago. Upon reaching the past, he collides with two angsty teens playing dress-up as gangbangers: Mikey and Draken. The President and vice president of the leading gang responsible for his ex-girlfriend’s death. There are two sides to the middle school turf war—Tokyo Manji Gang, a band of tough-as-nails bikers who value loyalty and honesty above all else. Secondly, the Black Dragons, known for their belligerent behavior.<br />
<br />
After his first foray into the past, Takamichi is sent back to the future™, where his life has suspiciously continued. He finds out his past alterations carry over in the present, such as a new scar on his hand. How the time travel mechanics work in Tokyo Revengers is left to our imagination. There’s hardly any logical consistency, and that’s the bare minimum. To travel between time periods, Takamichi has to shake hands with Naoto, the brother of his deceased girlfriend. For what reason? How does this work? Don’t think about it. When Takamichi returns to the future, the past Takamichi does not recall anything that happened. While Takamichi is in the past, he is shown sleeping in the future upon his return. Other times he reappears at different locations doing mundane daily activities. The time skips beg many questions: Does the past Takamichi inhabit the mind of the present one? The young version of Takamichi loses his memories; how does that affect his relationships with his girlfriend and the Tokyo Manji gang? Exploring these questions would make for a much more compelling and intelligent show. It is better not to think about the time travel mechanism of Tokyo Revengers because the more you do, the less it makes sense. A logically tight anime like Steins;Gate utilized its time travel element to tell a more compelling story, but it feels tacked on here.  <br />
<br />
The death of Naoto’s sister, Hinata, inspired him to seek justice alongside Takamichi. Assumably he utilizes his police power to track down criminals and map how they went from delinquents to a life of crime. Naoto’s purpose in the story is primarily as a plot device to assist Takamichi. Secondly, to motivate him to keep fighting. Namely, he slaps some sense into him after he has one of many emotional breakdowns. Speaking of which, this guy cries a lot—Takamichi puts every other crybaby shounen protagonist to shame. His frustratingly immature personality makes any potential investment in the show a difficult task. He is the kind of character who gets his lunch money stolen, beaten up, and shoved in a locker on the same day. Rather than coming up with rational solutions, he gets his ass kicked, blames himself, then metaphorically cries in someone’s lap until the problem disappears. The times he stands up for himself are few and far between. Weak and emotional character traits can make great protagonists. But rather than intervening, he is usually a helpless bystander—this defeats the purpose of traveling back in time. This man is 26 years old, yet 15-year-olds constantly outsmart him. Although he knows what will happen in the future, he only uses that information to say, “Hey, look, I remember that guy from the last episode!” The anime adapted two out of the five arcs, so Takamichi has time to redeem himself. Are you willing to struggle through an additional mediocre 24 episode season? I’m not. <br />
<br />
Though he grows to care about the Tokyo Meji gang members, Takamichi is driven to save Hinata. That must mean she’s a pretty great character, right? Or is she just a damsel in distress with a personality as deep as a puddle? She is more like a carrot at the end of a stick used to move the plot forward. She exists to add stakes, not to be a nuanced character. The occasional romantic moments between Hinata and Takamichi (in the body of a teen) attempt to be touching and heartfelt, but they come off as concerning. Remember, he’s 26, and she’s like 15 at most. Thankfully, her relevance is next to none, and their romance is mainly written off later. Despite her importance in the plot, Hinata has the least screentime out of every main character. Lack of character development is an issue that extends to everyone; the Tokyo Manji kids are thinly drawn archetypes. A few of them have aside backstories to give us an explanation of the gang’s origins. Draken and Mikey get the most screentime, and they’re two of the best characters in the show. Draken has sympathetic reasons for staying by Mikey’s side and wanting to protect him—there’s palpable tension when he is in danger. Mikey is a loose cannon because of traumatic experiences the show touches on in his backstory. I wanted to see more of them. If only their characterization wasn’t forgone in favor of uninteresting plot development. Ultimately Tokyo Revenger’s most vital point of writing was its wild Jojo’s-esque characters, but begrudgingly it is a plot-driven story.<br />
<br />
I’m thankful the anime’s tone stays pretty consistent. There’s no misplaced comedy to worry about, unlike Demon Slayer and its contemporaries. If anything, Tokyo Revengers can create a tense atmosphere; dramatic orchestral music plays during emotional moments and guitar riffs during tense confrontations. Dr. Stone’s excellent soundtrack was composed by the same musician… but the similarities are a little too plentiful. There’s not enough nuance to Tokyo Revengers’ OST. Frankly, it lacks a distinct or memorable identity and is another annoying source of déjà vu. The use of foley combined soundtrack is what makes the fights feel impactful—the squelching of a goon getting slugged sounds visceral. The sound effects enhance the atmosphere, but the art ruins it completely. This anime looks like it was created in 2005 and sent to the future along with Takamichi. Even up close, the characters’ facial proportions appear poorly drawn. Whenever there’s a group of people on screen, they look laughably warped. If you’re familiar with studio LIDENFILMS, you’ll recognize their work. They cut corners as often as possible.<br />
<br />
For a show that strives to be believable, its dialogue is melodramatic to the point it’s unintentionally funny. The gang members have superhuman strength that’d make them more suited to Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. In a different show, that’d be badass, but it’s difficult to suspend my disbelief when a 15-year-old takes down a guy twice his size with one kick. Their hyperbolic personalities fit their young age, but middle school students look much more youthful than these guys. It’s not like they are living in the inner city. Unless the screenwriters cut out background details, they seem privileged enough. Seeing kids put on tough-guy appearances is cringe-worthy. Although, the voice actors do a fair job of conveying the faux machismo of each middle school boy (most of which look and sound like they’re 25 years old). <br />
<br />
Seeing the dozens of middle schoolers rumbling in the streets of suburban Japan constantly made me wonder: Where the hell are their parents? Does no one see these kids are trying to kill each other? There is no one in this mid-2000s setting except for children. There are no parents, no police, not even an ambulance to pick up the kids bleeding onto the street. Excluding Takamichi’s family makes him less relatable and believable. Do his parents not care that he comes home bruised and beaten every night? If they do, show us more. <br />
<br />
Tokyo Revengers has an enticing premise: Go back in time to save your friends from a life of crime, despair, and early premature death. The show wastes half of its runtime on childish playground brawls following thinly written juvenile gangbangers. No doubt the complete lack of animation is to blame for the mind-numbingly boring Bloody Halloween arc.

    Such a boring show, typical time travelling, middle school gangs who look like adults, goofy mc, no emotion this show it the defenition of a hype train.<br />
<br />
Or so a fool would say...<br />
<br />
This spring season has been producing amazing and interesting shows but for me tokyo revengers takes the cake here. Our protagnist Takemitchi is on a mission to save Hina from her destined fate and has to work back in time solving events in order to stop the inevitable.<br />
<br />
What intrests me the most about this show is the way our protagnists wants to protect his girlfriend but 8 episodes in and hes already growing bonds

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400927">
        with others, I&#039;ve grown attached to characters like Mikey and Draken for their badass persona and their flucating relationship always has me on the edge of my seat because you know at the back of your mind that there will be a domono effect on events.<br />
<br />
The story is super compelling and has me intrested a few episodes in. The plot twists, turns and cliff hangers reminds me of watching attack on titan for the first time. We know that the main mission is to save Hina but boy oh boy are there some intresting obstacles that takemitchi has to execute almost perfectly.<br />
<br />
The art is really nice and if im not mistaken this is a pretty new studio and has done an excellent job  on creating vibrant colors especially shown in the intro. Aswell as this, this sound is absolutelty fitting and a pleasure to hear.<br />
<br />
The characters are really likeable and were only 8 episodes in. Theyre really intresting to learn about and there are so many more which im eager to discover aswell as the roots of Toman gang. Also, they are almost representative of gangs (not for middle schoolers lol) and really shows the Japanese side of things which is always super cool to learn.<br />
<br />
Overall, the enjoyment for this show is super high and always cant wait for it on saturdays after nagatoro, vivy, 86. and mha. I have high hopes for this show and cannot wait for ep 9.

    Although I want to bash Tokyo Revengers (TR) for all its worth, I found myself on the cheering side of the show. <br />
<br />
It is a fact that watching TR can be a bit frustrating at times, with its endlessly slow pace of development, musclebrain characters that are only full of punches, an exaggerated fight filled with bloody spurts, and the poorly excused plot just because it needs to. Can TR still be considered as a good series in the end? My answer would still be yes, it is. <br />
<br />
As a newcomer to the time-traveling genre, TR manages to present itself as a brand new story with a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417156">
        fresh foundation. It doesn&#039;t follow all its predecessors as it comes up with its brand new setting and premise. While it can be a bit more unrealistic at times, the series still manages to pull it off fairly well despite the odds. The story tells you the journey of one pathetic adult who tries to reclaim his long-lost regrets and undo that accursed past tragedy in his life.<br />
<br />
First thing first, the battle of the throne is viewed from Takemichi perspective. He is your typical cowardly grown-up adult who is a loser in life. A weak guy who cries at everything and there is nothing special about him that makes him loveable at all. Worse, it can be a bit unbearable to see that every fight will leave him all black and blue. But if there are one or two things that make him different from the rest, then it is his strong willpower and effort to make things change for the better. As the series progresses, we can notice that there is this one lone fighter who keeps standing up against all adversaries, no matter how beaten up he gets. He refused to give up and kept fighting while carrying those heavy responsibilities and burdens. For sure, he is not the brightest bulb when it comes to fighting or figuring things out, but his effort and willpower alone are second to none. And before we know it, our gaze is simply attracted to him. A guy who simply yearns for his long-lost loved one. As he struggled and sacrificed everything, again and again, to reach the happiest end, this is the story of the fall-and-rise of Takemichi. It is the main drive that makes me fall in love with this series. As they say, when one struggles in life, it is always a treat for the eyes.<br />
<br />
Although the pace and development of TR can be as slow as a turtle, it is more than rewarding once you have finished it. As it keeps getting more exciting as each episode passes by, the fights also begin to be more vicious than ever. But fret not, as it will always keep you on edge because the TR world can be a bit more demanding than your typical wholesome shounen story. Not to mention that the TR hype and gang wars feel way too real. It is so good to the point that it makes us yearn for more. And if there is one thing that TR doesn&#039;t lack, then it is its character development and growth. Here and there, you can see that every single one of them has grown quite considerably by the end of the series. And the relationship that they had with each other was beautiful enough to make one envious. There are times when you can simply smile or laugh because of the funny yet cute character interactions, and there are also times when you will cry and sob just because of how sad it was. It was a fun and loveable relationship. But unfortunately, not even these qualities managed to stop the fall and demise of TR. That is none other than the bad art and poorly animated animations that make it worse. It is atrocious enough to the point that not even Ghibli, Toei, or Mappa studios can save it from its falling grace. As much as I hate to say this, it is one of the biggest shortcomings in TR.<br />
<br />
And certainly, TR might not be a perfect masterpiece of gems, but that doesn&#039;t stop it from being an enjoyable show for you to enjoy. Do expect some edgy and cringe lines here and there, as it merely does its role to spice up things for an action series. Yet surprisingly, almost all of the characters are very charming, and the plot itself keeps us tightly invested till the end. Honestly, I think it wouldn&#039;t be fair for us to outright dismiss the series&#039; charm points, just because of the character who acts like a kid or a random stupid character in general. A friendly reminder that it always takes a lot of life experience to be mature. And sometimes, being an adult doesn&#039;t necessarily mean becoming more experienced in life struggles. Hence, this is what makes TR more interesting. As it isn&#039;t just there for the fight, but rather, to depict the struggle of Takemichi ever-changing life for the better. And the future happiness that is awaiting him at the end of the tunnel is more than enough. Personally, there is that one scene in TR that managed to make me tear up, and I&#039;d say it was a great treat for making me so emotional. And in the end, TR manages to flourish through all of its flaws with its distinctive characters and never-ending bombing action scenes.

    Even if you ignore the snail’s pace, the five minute recaps, and the shitty slide-show animation, this show is just dumb and bad. <br />
Spoilers ahead.<br />
<br />
Fans of shounen anime do themselves and their favorite new seasonal show a huge disservice when they label it as being “different” or unique, because when this ignorant praise catches the attention of anyone who has seen more than a few dozen anime, those people are immediately disappointed the second they see it. It’s often said the worst thing you can do to a series is overhype it, because when it inevitably turns out to be utterly mediocre, it won’t meet

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417132">
        anyone’s expectations. Tokyo Revengers is not only unexceptional, but it’s painfully generic and boring as sin, and since its production values are shoddy as shit, you’ll never be able to pull a Demon Slayer and use cool fights to excuse bad writing, because it usually just looks like garbage. Nothing about its plot or characters can stand up to other shows in the same genre which outdo it in every way, because there are better anime with delinquents, time travel, or somewhat retro designs. The character designs are not only hideous, but they just don’t make any sense. Our twenty six year old protagonist looks no different than his middle school self, and his middle school peers look twice as old as he did when he was twenty six. And, yes. I didn’t mean to so quickly brush past something that ridiculous, but this really is a show about time traveling middle-school delinquents.<br />
<br />
If you’ve hung around the anime community long enough, you should be quite familiar with the wannabe intellectuals who’ve taken upon themselves a mighty crusade against shows like Steins;Gate which they deem to be less intelligent than the average viewers does. I use Steins:Gate as an example because it’s about time travel, and shows about time travel are the number one target for people like this because, just in case you didn’t know, time travel doesn’t actually exists in real life. With enough theoretical pseudoscience on their side, your average keyboard warrior can dismantle even the most carefully constructed piece of fiction centered around time travel. The planning of Steins;Gate is shockingly thorough, and the concepts it uses to excuse its scientific elements which may not make perfect sense in real life is seriously well-researched, but since it is ultimately grounded in theory, anyone with enough contrarian spirit shouldn’t have too much trouble poking holes in its plot. Tokyo Revengers makes this effort look like a complete joke. The series makes no attempt to be logically comprehensive or take into account the timeline or butterfly effect, and when it first introduced its time travel mechanics, I could’ve sworn it was trying to be funny and parody Erased. But no. It’s actually taking itself seriously, and that’s fucking sad.<br />
<br />
It’s quite a common thing to complain about whinny, wimpy protagonists in anime. From the classics like Shinji Ikari to the modern horrors like Izuku Midoriya, anime made for teenage boys is filled to the brim with crybaby losers who you just want to shut up and do the thing, but in the case of shows which are actually well-written, the main character’s awful attitude is typically corrected, and they soon learn to grow up. The show which immediately comes to my mind when talking about this is Eureka Seven. Renton Thurston was universally hated at the time that show was airing, and to this day, people are still getting fed up with his bullshit and dropping that show early on. However, Renton undergoes an incredible character arc in that show, and by the end, he is a truly capable, respectable young man. I would argue Eureka Seven is still a bad show for different reasons, but that’s neither here nor there. The point is: character development makes a story worthwhile. In Tokyo Revengers, any praiseworthiness shown by Takemichi is impermanent. It’s an anime based on an incomplete shounen manga which is built to go on forever, getting dragged out until people stop buying it, and while I’m sure it’ll end with Takemichi being somewhat less of a pathetic pussy, that is not the case by the end of these torturous twenty four episodes. <br />
<br />
The setting, despite being the real world, is absurd. I’m not the first person to point this out, but nobody looks or acts like they’re realistically supposed to. These kids are supposed to be fourteen years old, and yet they look and act like professional mobsters. Anime is notorious for never showing parents, but this show takes that meme to the next level. Both the teachers and the police are presented—if at all—as being completely unable to stop a bunch of little boys from wrecking havoc. Remember how the setting of Kill la Kill was built around satirizing highschool anime, and how the students ran the city whilst the adults operated completely at the behest of the student council? At times, this show feels like that, only it’s not satire. It takes itself 100% seriously and expects you to do the same. Any attempt to make the story feel grounded is squandered by the characters’ goofy costumes, haircuts, and tattoos, and any attempt at high-stakes drama is laughable. The Power of Friendship; Talk no Jutsu; using Kirito’s “sheer willpower” to overcome the impossible; constant deus ex machina; WAITING FOR YOUR DYING FRIEND TO FINISH MONOLOGUING INSTEAD OF CALLING A FUCKING AMBULANCE; this series contains every awful shounen trope you can imagine, and watching it all unfold is as cringeworthy as you can imagine.<br />
<br />

    Tokyo Revengers hasn&#039;t even gone 1/2 of the way through its&#039; runtime, and already the flawless 10/10 scores have come flooding in-- many of which are written by readers of the source material. As someone who&#039;s also read the manga, I further affirm that Tokyo Manji Revengers is a fantastic read that had me on the edge of my seat and my heart jumping out of my chest.<br />
That being said, if you asked me if this anime adaption is equally entertaining, or an upgrade upon the source material? I would have to disappointedly tell you that, no, this animated version of the story does not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401591">
        make you cry or laugh quite the same as the black and white pages.<br />
Now I&#039;m going to go into a fair amount of detail about the exact reasons for my critique and score, but if you desire a summary/TL:DR I&#039;ll leave it right here:<br />
Tokyo Revengers&#039; anime adaptation features an amazing opening song, a captivating time-travel story, and does not do a disservice to the source material by staying true to the plot and making no deviations. Yet despite these good aspects: the cartoonish style of the anime compared to the realistic style of the manga, the abundance of still animation in action scenes and closeups, and the badly implemented soundtrack in otherwise emotional moments ruining the delivery makes Tokyo Revengers an extremely average adaption of an above average manga. <br />
<br />
Art: Lets start with arguably the biggest problem with this animation: tone. From a dark and gritty story about criminal gangs-- to a slice-of-life shonen school story, a glance at the art of the Tokyo Revengers anime would make you assume the latter more than the former. A big reason for this is the more elaborate and realistic design of the manga not being adapted into the anime. While one features faces where eyelashes, noses and mouths are sometimes drawn in life-like detail, the other opts for a look that is more akin to Boku no Hero than Berserk. While, on paper, that isn&#039;t a huge problem, it tends to ruin the more gritty gut-wrenching moments. The other big problem is that the animation features a lot of stills. Characters don&#039;t move or have any dynamic actions; every anime has these; but, even in the action there is a disappointing abundance of still frames, where there is neither dynamic &quot;camera movement&quot; or character animation. In this aspect, I suppose you could ironically say that the anime is faithful to the manga, but simply coloring in manga panels and calling it animation is definitely a negative rather than a positive. <br />
<br />
Sound: In this department I&#039;d call it a draw. I both love and hate the sound related aspects of this anime. <br />
Lets start with the positive sides: the opening and ending songs of the anime are beautifully done. Crybaby, the song by Hige Dandism is, I&#039;d argue, the greatest highlight of this anime; it perfectly encapsulates the vibe and emotions of the protagonist into a song, it has elements of despair/desperation in the singer&#039;s strained vocals, but also a sense of redemption &amp; determination in the drums/guitar &amp; piano in the backdrop. It is also a plus that the voice-acting cast is well chosen, and all the characters are done perfectly by their respective seiyuus. Every character&#039;s voice feels like it belongs, and the emotions within their voices feel genuine and add to every scene. (as for the english-dub though, I might be wrong, as I have less experience there).<br />
However, overshadowing the good, the sound-design throughout the anime is incredibly bland and does very little to elevate the emotions in the iconic scenes. The bigger sin, however, is that rather than failing to elevate the emotional impact of scenes, it actually takes away from the good work done on the voice-acting front. So far, scenes that left an impression on me from the manga have fallen so flat that I would sometimes feel like I missed the scene and have to play it back, only to realize that I simply was in denial that such emotion-filled drama could feel so drab when paired with the wrong music. <br />
<br />
Story: This is perhaps the one thing that I think the anime did a great job on, the general pacing of the story is acceptable so far. There are no major story elements of the manga being removed, like with the case of The Promised Neverland Season 2, or changed like in the 2003 version of Fullmetal Alchemist. That being said, it&#039;s hard to say much more at this stage as to whether or not the story is executed well, as a story&#039;s quality should be based on the sum of it&#039;s parts. So as far as this area is involved, I cannot give a proper review until later, when the final episode is aired. For now, lets just say that the story is still fairly captivating, though the art &amp; music for this show is decreasing my overall enjoyment of the plot as well. <br />
<br />
Overall Enjoyment: From the standpoint of someone who faintly remembers the plot and is experiencing the story for the second time: the Tokyo Revengers anime is fairly underwhelming, the emotional highs and lows are not the same, and the general aesthetic of the show is inferior to the books. The show is, so far, a bit different to swallow, like a piece of steak that you&#039;ve been trying to break apart but chewed all the flavor out of. That being said, that might not be the same for first time viewers, and whatever your experience of this fantastic story is, I highly suggest you give the manga a try, whether you pick it up at the end of the anime, or start from 0 or half way, it will surely give you a thrilling ride from start to finish.

    Okay, I was a little underwhelmed when first coming into this. But as the episodes played out one by one, The story just got better and better. I have seen people call this an Erased ripoff but what they fail to realize is how much they casually use this and it just becomes amazing as the plot progresses and each time Takemichi returns to the present, a new timeline unfolds and it just feels fresh instead of just repeating the cycle! <br />
<br />
Though character designs might not be the best, the sound not be the one to please your ears but the overall storyline combined with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401675">
        the cliffhanger of each episode just makes you come back for more , and that just brings more hype for the next episode! <br />
<br />
After all, this is definitely something to look out for this season!

    The most overrated anime of the year and perhaps the decade, even though the pacing of the story is bad you could have enjoyed the story if they changed the main character he has absolutely 0 likable attributes and makes You hate the whole anime.<br />
<br />
the author fails in explaining anything in regards of time travel and the trigger for it,<br />
<br />
 I have watched 9 episodes and there is 0 progress in the story and the main character development. <br />
It feels like you are wasting your time by watching it, you could spend the time on other anime’s you missed or tv series’s <br />
<br />

    Time travel, the most overworked setting of every sci-fi show to ever come out. It’s such a simple concept on paper yet extremely difficult to execute properly in any medium. Most time travel shows follow two paths. They either shine brightly and is remembered by people as a revolutionary piece of media such as Terminator or Back to the Future, or is over hyped and falls into the pit of mediocrity and is forgotten by most people. Tokyo Revengers unfortunately follows the latter of these two paths.<br />
<br />
If the word “Overhyped” had a picture, it would be the Tokyo Revengers poster. A show filled with annoying

        characters and a story with enough plot holes to make a sponge seem like a plain surface. The story follows our mc travelling back in time to save his girlfriend from her demise. It’s your classic cliché romance setting with a time travel aspect, which if explained carefully and presented properly, could be a hit of a show. Unfortunately it fails in both regards. It starts off pretty strong but pretty quickly loses its focus.<br />
 The initial problem is the time travelling aspect in this show which isn’t explained properly. The mcs actions while time travelling has serious consequences on the very people he is trying to save, but the seriousness of that is barely expressed as you see him make abhorrent and ridiculous decisions. The time travelling aspect is barely touched upon and nothing is properly explained. The story also plays out safe, it kills off characters meant to be killed off, and doesn’t force the mc to make a difficult choice. There’s no sacrifice that has to be made. It ventures in a straight, risk less line towards its goal, which doesn’t work as the whole point of time traveling is to create conflicts due to changing events of the past to the established future. We have barely any information on the time aspect, which leaves the story with too many plot holes. If the main theme remains convoluted, then the story is on a fast track to failure. <br />
The risks of infiltrating and living a delinquent lifestyle, mixed with the perils of constant time travelling could have been an extremely intriguing plot, filled with suspense and tension if executed properly. Unfortunately the mcs the most unlikable person to ever exist since Kirito. The plot holes gets you more and more disjointed from the story the further you watch. The show drags out a lot in the closing arcs, the pacing gets rough as some scenes that required more details are tossed aside. Characters make ridiculous and extremely stupid decisions which doesn’t make sense. “Appointing a member of the gang you just fought with as your captain” the thought itself should be enough to make you realize it’s a bad decision. <br />
The romance in this show just doesn’t work. We have Emma, she’s bland as flour. There’s nothing about her that makes Takemichis efforts in saving her worthwhile. She’s established as your classic, super likeable waifu character. In the show we rarely see her coming out of her shell or showing any signs of development. Her delusion towards Takemichi is unjustifiable. We get no coherent reasoning as to why she’s so accepting of him, even after all the shit he does. In the future she says how Takemichi hurt her, but then proceeds to express her love for him like bruhhh that isn’t how shit works. It goes vice versa too. Takemichi was an adult when Hinata died. Why is he this envious in saving the girls life whom he hasn’t interacted with for years? A mentally 26 year old guy crushing over a 14 year old is creepy to begin with, even without that, his whole dilemma towards her makes no sense. The romance in this show is horrible, super cliché and bland, with characters taking and doing ridiculous stunts in the name of “love”. There’s nothing to appreciate about these characters, let alone putting this much effort in saving them.<br />
In the later arcs of the show, we see a lot and I mean a lot of unneeded conflicts and fights. Now don’t get me wrong, that’s probably the most enjoyable aspect of the show, but it’s so unnecessary and completely splits away from the main goal of the show. We see some unneeded conflicts arise due to a lot of really stupid decisions. Some conflicts could have been solved if the mc was efficient enough in using his brain as he is using his fist. It’s really messy plot wise, but super entertaining otherwise. The ending couple of episodes is honestly the most entertaining mess I’ve watched recently.<br />
<br />
Now let’s get to the worst part of the show, the MC. Pathetic, whiny, displeasing, and aggravating. Every synonym of the word annoying can be used to describe him. He to me is like the modern day Kirito, annoying for a completely different reason. The whole aspect of going back to the past to change the future is complicated, and one needs to be intelligent and make the right decisions. Unfortunately our mc does none of those. He cries, uses himself like a punching bag, and has the most action over words type of attitude I’ve seen. He is extremely unlikable. He goes against every trope of a shounen protagonist. There’s no redeeming factors about him. He is meant to be a kid, but he plays that role a bit too well, so much so that there’s not even a hint of maturity coming from him. His whole persona revolves around making big goals then failing to fulfill them. Id honestly prefer a mute, personality less hentai mc than blonde crybaby Kirito.<br />
Onto the good characters. Draken and Mikey. There probably the most likeable aspects of the show. They go against every trope you think of when you see the word “Gang member”. We see this initially when they apologies to the mother of a girl who was a victim of a gang violence. It sets them apart from your classic gang member ideology, and the more time passes, the more you see these two characters come out of their shells. Definitely the most entertaining and likeable characters from the show. <br />
Other characters such as Kazutora, Chifuyu and Baji each have their roles to play, especially in the ending arcs of the anime. You don’t get as attached to them as Mikey or Draken due to their arguably short screen time, but they’re entertaining to watch nonetheless. Kazutora and his dive into insanity is intriguing. He choreographs his plan to kill Mikey as a scapegoat to justify the actions of him committing murder in his past, is super stereotypical yet really entertaining. His actions leads to the ending arc of the anime being something out of the Yakuza games. Fight after fights, completely unnecessary but extremely entertaining. <br />
Other characters like Naota, Hinata, and Emma gets left unexplored or paid much attention too. Naota’s meant to be a super smart cop and shit, but has the least impact in the show in any ways. The first half of the story revolves heavily around Hinata, but she herself doesn’t contribute much to the story itself. Her character doesn’t go against the basic anime waifu tropes. She simultaneously feels like a person and a robot. These characters could have been integral to the story, but were unused and unexplored which made them pretty forgettable and sometimes extremely redundant when it came to having an impact on the story.<br />
<br />
Coming to the art aspect of the show, it’s extremely mediocre. It’s visually eye-catching, but the more you get into the plot, the more the art style starts getting almost painful to watch. The characters look like they’re going through a mid-life crisis in their teens. The art style cannot clearly depict the characters ages at all. Adults look like overgrown children, and the actual children look like they hit puberty in their mother’s womb. The blood and gore in the uncensored version looks comical, and honestly less intimidating and more hilarious. The art in this show starts off as a high, but gets mediocre as you start relating it with the plots. It’s not enough to go bleach your eyes, but enough to reconsider putting your eyes through the pain of watching this lobotomites in every episode. The animation is no saving grace either, it’s definitely no Jujutsu Kaisen, and pretty sub-par often times, with enough still frames to give food wars a run for their money. But considering it’s a pretty new studios, it has done average with what resources they had. All in all, Tokyo Revengers was the Cyberpunk 2077 of anime, extremely hyped up and disappointing results.<br />
<br />
Now, is Tokyo Revengers a bad show?<br />
Objectively, Yes<br />
Personally, Fuck No<br />
<br />
The series being a big ball of messy plot, weird looking characters and unnecessary action makes this show fun. Just like how Cyberpunk was fun cause of its glitches, TR is fun cause of its convoluted plot and absolute abhorrent looking characters. It’s entertaining watching the cliché filled romance of the show. You realize that it’s stupid as shit and boring but that’s what’s entertaining. The last arc for me was amazing. I barely understood anything, I just enjoyed the constant beating up, blood gushing out of everyone while they give a friendship speech, and it was entertaining as hell. I can only describe it as the visual representation of Jamie Vardy’s “Chat shit get banged” tweet. It was an entertaining experience for me for a completely different reason. I do wish that the show would have been a lot more leaning towards conflicts being solved with proper decision making. This show is pure brainless fun. Apart from the mc being annoying enough to make you want to tear out your eardrums, every flawed aspect of the story was extremely amusing for me, and added more amusement to the show. Definitely would implore you to give this a shot if you’re bored. The show will make you scratch your head while simultaneously entertaining you with its awful yet entertaining, super convoluted, overtly dramatic, disproportional looking characters, and boy I enjoyed every second of it.

    Avoid this, if your 12 years old cousin, Virgil, is telling you that this anime is good, just tell him to get lost because this crap doesn&#039;t deserve your attention, dear sir, just go ahead and watch anything else, there are better movies about time traveling, better anime, better tv shows.<br />
First of all, I would like to point out the lack of mature characters and authority figures in this anime... So puffed up 15-16 years old kids can do whatever they want in Tokyo without anyone telling them anything, they live in gangs, they fight to the death in parks, they have access to knives,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407813">
        pumps even motorcycles at 16 years old, you can just add this anime to the genre &quot;fantasy&quot; because that&#039;s kind of what it is a wannabe Craiova (NOTE: Craiova is the city from Romania, where people often fight over anything and sometimes not even the police can stop them, lots of murders happen there every year because of any stupid reason you can think of.).<br />
Second of all, I have decided to drop this anime after 14 episodes because most of the characters are dreadful, boring, repetitive, there is always that character you suspect is behind everything bad that happens in the story, but he is not, and you keep on suspecting every new character evil-looking is behind the bad thing that had to happen to the main character. Shit repetitive twists like that make the story worse, and characters like Mikey and Draken lose their credibility when they refuse to side with our main character despite everything that he has done for them.<br />
I would say that kids will probably enjoy this, that is thought so 14-15 years old kids will love it, but with all this blood I don&#039;t think Tokyo Revengers aim for the younger generation as their audience<br />
<br />
Overall after 14 episodes watched I got to the conclusion that Tokyo Revengers is a reheated porridge that is served to us every week.

    Tokyo Revengers is one of, if not the worst anime to air this year.<br />
Had to quit this generic shitshow of an anime and picked up the manga to see if it actually improves but boy was I wrong, the manga is just as awful, maybe even worse. The Characters are super unlikeable &amp; generic, like I have frickin seen this same set so many times in other works. Plus this is like a copy of other manga/anime meshed together; the likes of Erased+Steins;gate, but I wouldn&#039;t critique it for this, since maybe they come off as inspiration. <br />
<br />
Anyway, Story: 1/10. This is a show about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407092">
        Juvenile Delinquents in middle school, bunch of teenage boys who come together to play gangster, fight and nearly beating each other to death. Where are the fucking adults is one thing that comes to mind, you never see the teachers or parents, ignore the fact that the MC is a fucking adult who goes back in time to his teenage years cause that&#039;s about all you get. These kids go on about as if they is in an anarchy system, all around organizing fights, and almost killing each other, sometimes someone ends up dead. <br />
<br />
The plot has no originality whatsoever, the time travel isn&#039;t even explored or properly gotten into, heck the characters do not even seem too shocked about the whole time travel stuff. They just go on about it as if it&#039;s something normal, the reaction to the entire time travel thing is just sad. The anime doesn&#039;t get any better, Takemitchy the MC is as useless as they come, the biggest Crybaby you&#039;d ever see, in every episode this guy is crying. Like Fucking Amano Yukiteru &amp; that loser from gleipnir are much better characters, development &amp; character wise. The story keeps circling over and over again with the littlest changes. Pretty much all the MC does is cry and vent about how fucking useless he is. Plot remains stagnant, doesn&#039;t go anywhere from starting point. <br />
<br />
Art: 5/10. Mediocre art style, nothing unique. Not horrible &amp; not even good. Well I don&#039;t got much to say about artstyle, I pretty much watch everything without criticizing the animation. But even I can identify great quality animation when I see one and appreciate.<br />
<br />
Sound: same as art. The OP/Ed isn&#039;t my cup of tea. Find myself skipping both, nothing special honestly. <br />
<br />
Characters: 1/10. I can&#039;t even stress the weakness of the characters in this anime. Most times the author goes for self-pity, yeah let&#039;s all pity this one guy &amp; he&#039;s just being a shitty person for this and that reason bullshit. Oh yeah, in the upcoming bloody halloween arc, we get to meet one of the founders of the Toman gang, the reason for why he goes bad &amp; turned against em is so fucking😂😂😂😂 I can&#039;t even, lemme nor spoil, see for yourselves. <br />
Honestly the characters are bland, uninteresting and the MC is just the worst, a crybaby that never changes. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10. Literally forced myself into watching this, would&#039;ve so quit at EP3, but a friend kept raving about how it gets better &amp; bullshit. I don&#039;t regret picking this up, it is just so horrible, not good, not even a little.<br />
Well I guess there&#039;s a target audience and I honestly can&#039;t comprehend how the score for it is so high lol. <br />
<br />
Overall: 2/10. This is a dreadful anime for me, with horrible pacing and Toddler level writing.<br />
<br />
<br />

    some spoilers ig<br />

TLDR: cliché, relationships of all kind are cliché, vocabulary is cliché, timing is cliché, animation is cliché, reactions are cliché, most characters are cliché. very good plot wasted.<br />
<br />
appalling that&#039;s all i can say, 8 episodes in and only 1 ep was enjoyable the rest is quite literally soft torture, fighting through every minute because i like the plot. constantly overexplaining stuff(even tho time travel is poorly explained), always letting the watcher know whats happening way before the characters, which makes their reactions pathetic, random stupid tiny mistakes that are easy to spot(eg hina spots takemitchy after he spots her even tho hes half

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400431">
        knocked out in ep8 18min), friendships are cringe, always smiling admiring each other caring constantly ab each other, with the power of friendship u can win over anything kind of anime, characters use very cartoon esq vocabulary, not realistic at all (tries to punch sm1, misses and goes flying across 10 meters), it just looks like it was made for kids that dont care ab all this stuff, but then the plot involves gangs, fighting, naked girls and romance, so really confusing anime.   <br />
love the plot i like the old school gang vibe, the fact that hes trying to help his childhood gf is p cool, the fact that hes falling in love with her again and then he probs wont be able to stay with her cuz he has to go back to the future is p cool (maybe he can decide between staying in the past or going back to future)the whole idea is lovely but very poorly portrayed into an anime.<br />
<br />
ig ill have to read the manga if i want to enjoy the plot.

    Time travel, a delinquent protagonist, and motorcycle gang fights? Sounds like a great concept, right? At least it does to me. That&#039;s what got me to start watching this show in the first place. After watching some episodes, I think that the score of this show is heavily inflated. <br />
<br />
This show was set up to be great, but main one thing really drags it down. That thing is the main character himself, Takemichi. Messing up the protagonist is a grave storytelling sin in my opinion. <br />
<br />
Takemichi is, to put it nicely, a bad character. His main role in the show is crying and getting beaten

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404232">
        half to death. Being physically or mentally weak isn&#039;t an issue if character development comes as a result of what happens, but the development here is pretty slow if not nonexistent. What&#039;s the appeal to seeing a main character be repeatedly battered and generally useless? <br />
<br />
The other characters of the main cast are better from what I&#039;ve seen. If Takemichi develops any more, I might think more highly of this series.

    I&#039;ve always loved astrophysics and the many concepts that come it. Such as the possibilities and constraints of how because we have mass, we cannot travel in time at the speed of light and thus need to hypothetically make use of black holes to warp time. And then comes the endless risks and possibilities about infinite timelines and the sorts. I&#039;m not stating this to seem smart or woke, it&#039;s just a branch of science that I love studying more about. However, in the case of this show, it does not implement it properly nor does it explore any compelling and imaginative methods on how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417155">
        to travel in time. The concept is mainly used as a deux ex machina to pull off asspulls at no risk. It&#039;s essentially a story about a 26 year old man who travels through Einstein Rosen bridges supposedly by shaking someone&#039;s hand and middleschoolers who could honestly give some of the best UFC fighters a run for their money. Had Takemitchy been present during Einsten&#039;s time to help him complete the theory of special relativity, we may have witnessed exponential growth throughout the history of mankind. Instead, he would rather use it to go back in time and join gangs to get beat up senseless by middleschoolers, while crying at least thrice per episode and doing nothing to change his situation. All of this feels even more unconvincing when you realise that it is all done for the sake of a girl he had completely forgotten about in the past 10 years. <br />
<br />
While we&#039;re on that topic, the further the show progressed, the more absurd it became: People got bonked with steel bars and stabbed repeatedly, yet walk off with a few scratches or live longer than necessary. Giving overly dramatic speeches when they should have died 30 minutes ago; Others boast supernatural strength capable of sending people flying with a single punch; And our protagonist can take hit after hit without losing consciousness, due to him persevering through &quot;the power of friendship.&quot; Something we&#039;ve all grown accustomed to. I wouldn&#039;t be so harsh on these points had the story been set in a fantasy premise but when the show is trying to portray realism, but often does the opposite. This would lead to a lot of questioning when unrealistic events occur. You would think that our protagonist would learn from his past experiences and refrain from gang activities. That he would journey on a new path of self-discovery presented by this golden opportunity to become a better person, focus on his studies, learn new life skills, find productive hobbies, meet dependable people who help him grow and leave the adults to solve issues beyond his control. Instead, he does not learn since he plunges even further into gang activities. The very thing that made him abandon the ones he cared about. Takemitchy is such a waste of a character. I tell you what, sometimes in life running away may be the best solution. It takes a lot of growth and maturity to recognize that. Especially when you&#039;re placed in an unfavorable situation like he was. What he failed to capitalize on was the opportunity he was given to start over when he ran away. He instead chose to wallow away for 10 years instead of actually taking a stance. <br />
<br />
The second time around is very similar but with a slight twist. He comes up with an unrealistic goal which came out of nowhere might I add, to become the leader of Toman and essentially try to save the people who bullied him. This guy just doesn&#039;t learn and it&#039;s incredibly frustrating. These ideals would have been more palatable had they come from a foolish teenager who had yet to learn about life&#039;s ordeals. The issue stems from that the individual piloting said teenager&#039;s body is in fact a 26 year old man who is at his second chance at redemption. There is no character development to be had in this story. He continued to fail and went back in time. Rinse and repeat, that&#039;s it. And speaking of development, Hinata was just a sorry excuse of a plot device to tell a story about middleschool gangs and prolong the snooze fest. Aside from its lazy writing, the show failed to deliver in other aspects as well: The fight choreographies are horrendous and often lack creativity; attack patterns are repetitive and defense is non-existent; camera view positioning lacks in motion fluidity; there is too much dependency on still shots; the comedy is dry and overused with grimaces that become redundant overtime; and the ending song sounds like it was recorded at a bar podium. Basically, the animation is an eyesore, the comedy is an unbearable attempt at cheap comedy and the sound direction is an earache. <br />
<br />
The story would have been more believable had the author removed the time travel aspect and placed the setting in high school or something. But I&#039;m guessing that he wanted to be different. The reality is that being different doesn&#039;t always warrant being better. Also, I&#039;m not so sold on middleschoolers tattooed like ex-convicts with extravagant hairstyles and piercings. They&#039;re repeatedly shoved down our throat as &quot;good guys&quot; that we should root for, but they look no different than the villains to me. They frequently beat their own friends to a bloody pulp, kill each other&#039;s brothers, vandalise stores and make their subordinates do uncomfortable things instead of them doing it. There isn&#039;t a single believable and relatable character except maybe Hinata, but she&#039;s barely present in the story. She just pops up here and there to give pretty gifts to our protagonist while he whimpers and vouches that he&#039;s going to save her for the hundredth time, only to go back and fail on repeat. In conclusion, if you&#039;re not interested in a compelling story and want mindless action, lack of character development, an MC who spouts idealism with inner dialogue 24/7 without taking action, then look no further. However, if you&#039;re looking for immersive storytelling with intricate characters and a believable setting, you may want to look elsewhere like myself. <br />
<br />
In the end, this is just my opinion.

    This is my First Review so I&#039;m sorry if its bad (This Review has Spoilers and sorry if the english is bad)<br />
<br />
First I was interested by the concept idea because it would be cool if done correctly. I thought I would like it but, it seems that this anime didn&#039;t explain what&#039;s happening and currently leave me confused. <br />
<br />
(Spoiler Alert)<br />
What leave me being confused is what happened on episode 1. The time travel thing wasn&#039;t explained thoroughly and I had a hard time thinking how it works. I know it is just fiction but even so it was hard to believe the time travel concept,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399815">
        unlike, Steins;Gate even though it was not explained scientifically, you know that even if its explained, you wouldn&#039;t get it so it just feels right.<br />
<br />
When the MC explained to Hina&#039;s brother that  they are going to die on that day, how can the brother faithfully believed him when you are just in elementary, if I&#039;m the one told that, I wouldn&#039;t believe it when I&#039;m finally out of elementary, I would think that it was just cap. <br />
Second how can the brother know how they are going to die, if the MC didn&#039;t even explain how. Even though he knows when he doesn&#039;t know the cause.<br />
<br />
TL:DR- There are part of the puzzles unsolved, I can&#039;t get in to it even though the concept was good. The author didn&#039;t explain everything so there are many plotholes. It was just like a parody of Erased, but high-schoolers are the one who wrote the plot.<br />
<br />
I just watched the latest episode and I can say that this anime is getting worse. The animation can&#039;t get exactly right what atmosphere are they going to put in that type of scenario. Then the heroine mc&#039;s &quot;girlfriend&quot; she got worried to the mc because she saw him beaten up and she doesn&#039;t even try to stop him from joining those so called gangs, it&#039;s like its fine for her if the mc is beaten up repeatedly.

    The anime started off strong, but as I watch the latest episode I just think to myself; &quot;where did it go wrong?&quot; It started off strong but really just devolved into mediocrity, even worse because it seemed like it was going places. However as the anime goes on, stuff gets ass pulled and the plot just becomes &quot;whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
I feel like in most time travel anime, the main character is smart enough to take that future knowledge and even be able enough, to improvise if things go different. However the MC is a failure by design, I&#039;m sure this is the authors intention but I&#039;m not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401683">
        going to wait around waiting for him to change and get good when it&#039;s been going downhill for 4 episodes already. <br />
<br />
Lastly just because the manga might be good, (as I have not read it) that doesn&#039;t mean the anime will be good. Really not sure what all these other good rating reviewers are seeing in this that I&#039;m not. <br />
<br />
I really don&#039;t have anything else to say right now, maybe I&#039;ll come back to this review as I intend to finish it after getting this far. However I don&#039;t have any hopes that&#039;s for sure. <br />
<br />
Final note: In the drop down menu 4 is &#039;Bad&#039; but when writing this review a 4 is &#039;Decent&#039; which this isn&#039;t. Therefore my rating dropped to &#039;3&#039; in line the appropriate description of &#039;Poor.&#039;

    The success of Tokyo Revengers may be no surprise for others, but it&#039;s a mystery for me. Because, although it presents itself as a time travel show at the start, it&#039;s a battle shounen that&#039;s filled with the tropes we saw countless times before. The only thing it differs itself from other popular battle shounens is it takes place in our world and our MC doesn&#039;t have any superpowers that will help him in fights. But most tropes the other battle shounens have are still there, and it uses them in the worst way possible. Unnecessary noisy MC? Check. Characters who win the fights by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417137">
        screaming? Check. Characters with 50 gallons of blood in their body? Check. And the list goes on... I wouldn&#039;t get surprised if Tokyo Revengers was a manga from the mid 00s, and people made it popular back in that time, but it got popular in 2020, seriously?<br />
<br />
The story of Tokyo Revengers follows a 26-year old Takemichi who just learned his ex-girlfriend was killed by a ruthless gang. After the bad news, he gets pushed into the trails in a train station by a mysterious person and when he thought he&#039;ll die, he goes back 12 years in time. The synopsis says these are the best days of his life, but I wonder if this has been written by a troll or not. Because these are the worst days of his life. He and his friends became slaves of stronger delinquents and get beaten by them every day. Aside from this trolling in the synopsis, Takemichi wants to save his girlfriend from Tokyo Manji Gang, so he needs to become the #1 delinquent in Japan and crush Tokyo Manji. So, how does it happen? By a lot of plot conveniences, of course. Because this isn&#039;t a show about a man who gains his second chance in life by working way harder and better than the first time, this is a show about a man child who gains his second chance by lucky encounters that happens so randomly. Everything happens so perfectly to help Takemichi save his ass from the shit, the only realistic explanation for this is all of the events in this show are Takemichi&#039;s dream. If you expected a time travel story where the MC uses his knowledge from the past to save his future, then sorry, just as I said before Tokyo Revengers is just another generic battle shounen.<br />
<br />
Characters are no different. They fit shounen tropes too, especially Takemichi. He&#039;s mostly a comic relief character who screams at every little thing, but when things get serious he will get a burst of courage and save the day. However, he will go back to his comic relief version after serious things are over just like nothing happened. The other main character of Mikey is generic too. He look and sound weak, but actually he&#039;s one of the strongest characters in the show. At least he&#039;s a likeable character unlike Takemitchi. And the supporting cast also doesn&#039;t offer anything good. Everyone in this show talks high and mighty, but when you remember they&#039;re a bunch of kids all the magic on them disappears. The only thing you see after that is stupid kids who fight over stupid things.<br />
<br />
There are also unanswered things regards to the time travel, but I won&#039;t talk about them because even the author didn&#039;t think too much on time travel so why would I do different? Also, I don&#039;t want to make this review any longer and finish it after talking about the production.<br />
<br />
Animations, backgrounds, character designs, etc. Every visual thing in this show looks like shit. LIDENFILMS isn&#039;t a studio that can pull a two-cour action anime, but they accepted the project. Why? Muh money. Animations look okay in the first episodes but fall of really fast. They used a lot of still images during fight scenes, and it killed most of the important scenes in the fights. Backgrounds look like they bought it from a random anime nobody knows. Character designs aren&#039;t that bad until you see the ears. You can question if they are actual humans or fennec foxes.<br />
<br />
Sound in Tokyo Revengers is a bit better than the visuals, but don&#039;t expect much. Some characters have good voice actings, but the person you will hear most, Takemichi, has one of the most annoying voices I&#039;ve heard in an anime. And when he screams at 60% of his screen time, this makes everything even worse. There isn&#039;t any soundtrack you&#039;ll remember after finishing the show too, so the sound is also another weakness of Tokyo Revengers.<br />
<br />
I talked harshly about most aspects of Tokyo Revengers, but the thing that concerns me most is there will be people who will idolize these characters. Characters of Tokyo Revengers may look cool and charismatic to you, but don&#039;t fall into this trap. If you want to idolize someone in this story, then idolize Naoto. He worked honestly and hard for saving his big sister. All the delinquents in this show need a teacher who will scold them hard and put them on a better path.

    The character design has a huge problem<br />
A grown-up MC would look exactly the same as he was in his high school years.<br />
But, a high-school mob character would look like they are in their middle age.<br />
Also, most of the characters have an extremely long neck which is kinda weird honestly.<br />
<br />
The time travel aspect of this anime is weak. It literally took 2 minutes for the characters to figure out what triggers the time travel that they did.<br />
Instead of spending time exploring how and why they time travel. this anime shows 0 effort in the time travel aspect. <br />
<br />
I know this is an anime about gangsters but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407540">
        I just can&#039;t help but wonder if the police, teachers, and their parents exist in the first place. I think most people have been to school at some point of their life and we can all relate to gangsterism in one way or another. But this is as far as what we have seen in reality. The &quot;gangster&quot; student seem to do whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted<br />
<br />
overall not a very good anime IMO, there are always much better options

    SPOILERFREE<br />
I never in my life wrote a review, but seeing this Anime and reading through all of the other peoples reviews, I just can&#039;t at all understand the overall score this Anime has. It not outright trash either, dont get me wrong, but here is my point of view:<br />
<br />
The Story is just shit really. Badly done Steins Gate, FULL of plotholes (and I didnt even try to look for it). Bad writing and nothing special at all. <br />
Girl dies, boy timetravels to save girl.<br />
When I felt like this Anime had a good conclusion in the 12th episode, everything turned upside down yet again, which is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404870">
        the reason I might just drop the show entirely.<br />
<br />
Add to that mediocre Animation and not so great sounddesign made me really dislike the show. <br />
<br />
Having that all in cosideration you could say that its all subjective at the end, but I feel like this show shouldnt be worth the &quot;masterpiece&quot;-status by anyone on an OBJECTIVE basis. This is not on the level of Steins Gate. Never. OBJECTIVELY.<br />
<br />
WTF; how is this anime so unbelievably highly rated, I just dont get it.<br />
<br />

    Tokyo Revengers is a very hilariously bad anime with quite a strong initial appeal but bafflingly weak execution. I really wanted to stop by episode 4; I held on to the endearing old school flair, but soon realized it&#039;s just a poor form of nostalgia bait that other anime have done and incorporated better.<br />
<br />
But being the special officially first dropped anime in my catalog as a MAL user, I feel compelled to at least put down my thoughts as to why I grew to just... be disconnected with it.<br />
<br />
Tokyo Revengers has laughably bad dialogue, very cheesy, very cliche, very predictable - all of which makes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404089">
        for a horribly slow pace that drawls on the screen. Initial appeal of the characters are solid and even charming, but the way the dialogue pretty much butchered the weight of their interactions just made the anime feel like a try-hard clownery.<br />
And hey, I also have to add how terribly amusing the time travel concept here in all the worst ways. I cannot for the life of me think how other people can see the time travel concept here as anything but a convenient plot device leaning on BS. If the anime wanted it to be a tribute to the old school atmosphere that it wanted to borrow, it could have at least done a decent job or handled things in a humorous self-aware notion... but it didn&#039;t. It clearly wants to be something grand in its presentation.<br />
<br />
No. It&#039;s bad. Laughably bad that grew to be amusing out of spite. It was fun to feel the atmosphere it wanted to portray. Other than that, no. This is one of the worst hyped anime I&#039;ve ever seen in recent seasons. Give it to other more deserving anime.
