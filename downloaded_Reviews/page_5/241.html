    Konosuba is pure, unbridled stupidity. Kazuma and crew are so unbelievably lacking in their mental faculties that it is a wonder how they are even capable of putting their own clothes on every day. That they even know how to breathe is surprising in its own right. <br />
<br />
Where most other anime in the fantasy genre-- Danmachi, Re:Zero and others of its ilk-- attempt to be absolutely and relentlessly serious at all times, Konosuba does away with the very notion of seriousness. It exists solely to be laughed at. And sometimes it does a pretty OK job at creating said laughs. It never aims to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242654">
        a &#039;good&#039; anime (least not in the traditional sense), and criticising it for not being such is kind of missing the point.<br />
<br />
It just becomes a bit difficult to keep laughing when they repeat the same jokes for the fifth or fiftieth time. <br />
<br />
Darkness is a thundering masochist who mentally orgasms and gets foamy-mouthed whenever she is treated poorly. The first season already made this joke several dozen times, so I get it. Kazuma will threaten her by promising to do unspeakable (!) things to her body, and, the deviant that she is, squirms in delight! No, look, I get it already-- I really, truly do. Her mind is so perverted that she will twist a friendly conversation into a suggestion of her being sexually assaulted by monsters and--- PLEASE, KONOSUBA. I GET IT. I get it, OK?<br />
<br />
For as much of a joke as Konosuba&#039;s characters are, there is only so much comedy they can create by repeating the same punch-line until the ends of time. There are other, more interesting things that can be done with Darkness&#039; character, surely. If this were pornography then maybe, perhaps, her characterisation would get a pass, but comedy requires considerably more effort than &quot;oh gee golly I am like so horny right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aqua, as tantalising as her mini-skirt is (and I have spent many a moment admiring her womanly curves), falls into much of the same issues, with her two defining traits being that she is a narcissist with an ego the size of Darkness&#039; breasts, and a crybaby who falls on her knees and wails at the top of her lungs when she doesn&#039;t get her way. Her gags, almost invariably, follow a pattern of these two traits: she uses her status as a goddess to demand favours and respect, and then breaks her character and cries immediately after. A little bit more involved than Darkness&#039; &#039;gag&#039;, sure, but it is still repeated to the point of nausea. <br />
<br />
Kazuma is likely the more interesting of the lot, since he at least exists as more than a vehicle for a single joke. He is not developed by any means-- lord, no, he is a complete dunce from beginning to end-- but his frequent switching from idiot to straight-man does at least provide some variety to the gags. Kazuma is a jerky little twat, incapable of respect and prone to molesting the opposite sex, and his assertive nature does well to set him apart from all the other spineless protagonists of the genre. His over-reactions to all the ridiculous nonsense around him (often the direct result of Aqua&#039;s or Darkness&#039; actions) are often still amusing, too, even if &#039;dude yells at stuff&#039; may not exactly be the most artful style of humour. You almost feel bad for the little bugger - I would probably want to off myself in his situation, too. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s not a whole lot to say about Megumin, considering she is pretty well non-existent for 90% of what happens in the second season. She&#039;s unquestionably the most sane of the four (though that isn&#039;t saying a whole lot...), and the one least susceptible to repeated gags. While the first season pushed it a bit by making her defective explosion magic and chuunibyou nature a recurring theme, the second season has next to none of it. And that&#039;s a good thing. I just wonder if, cute as she is, she might be a bit too normal the second time around.<br />
<br />
Konosuba just never capitalises on what made absurd comedy series like Osomatsu-san and Gintama so clever. There is wonderful opportunity here for it, as one of the only non-serious fantasy anime, to take the piss out of other titles in the genre and properly satirise them. Part of the joke is that the Gang of Stupid are woefully incapable of combat, unable to progress as one typically would in an MMO or fantasy world, and are able only to defeat monsters and enemies through luck and by surprising them with their colossal stupidity, provided they don&#039;t just scream and run away altogether. That&#039;s an amusing reversal of the genre&#039;s tropes. But that&#039;s all there is. There&#039;s no actual &quot;satire&quot;, no parody to be found in Konosuba - it is standard manzai comedy, living, and dying, by its own strengths and weaknesses. <br />
<br />
That isn&#039;t to say that Konosuba is without merit, or that watching it can&#039;t still be a fun time. If you enjoyed the first season or just want a short, easygoing anime that doesn&#039;t require much thought or focus, then, hey, it does its job just fine, even if it may at times feel more like a greatest hits compilation. Konosuba is a big, dumb show and it knows it. I just don&#039;t think that being dumb is an excuse for laziness.

    KonoSuba’s second season is here and it’s a fantastic follow up to last year’s fantasy/comedy series which deservedly became a massive hit among the anime community. <br />
<br />
One of the strongest points of this series is the characters and their interactions, Kazuma is one of the weird cases where I find the protagonist to be the best character of a comedy anime, he’s just such a lovable troll that has to deal with the weirdos around him, the first of them being Aqua, a cute but useless crybaby that has a godlike talent for performing party tricks. However, outside of that she lacks any other abilities

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242622">
        despite being an actual goddess. Most of the time she’s a hindrance to the group but damn she’s great.  There is also Megumin, a chuunibyou that wants to see the world explode (and she will be the one doing it, one explosion at a time). Last but not least there’s Darkness, a holy crusader that does her best in the front line, blocking the attacks of the enemies in order to defend her allies… well, that and to enjoy the pleasure of being hit, just masochist things. <br />
<br />
While the main cast are great, the side characters are certainly capable of stealing the spotlight. For example, there&#039;s Wiz, who is supposedly on the bad side but is probably the nicest person around, and Yunyun, another crimson mage like Megumin that really needs some love and headpats, poor girl. <br />
<br />
The characters are very enjoyable to watch and their wacky, random adventures are always hilarious. Their gags stay fresh and funny due to all the different situations the characters are thrown into. <br />
<br />
The RPG-like world adds a lot of variety to the comedy via fantasy elements and characters/monsters. Most series that use this type of setting tell a more serious story but KonoSuba uses it for comedic purposes. It’s a great, well-executed parody of the genre. Even the supposed ‘enemies’ are hilarious characters that add a lot of fun moments to this anime.<br />
<br />
Excluding the first episode, that for some motive had a derpier look, the art of this sequel was like in the first season, shining in showing the multiple reactions of the characters with comedic faces that add a lot to the humour of this anime. The music is similar to the first season, with a special mention for the new opening &quot;TOMORROW&quot;. It does a great job of showing what the anime is about, a bunch of weird people having lots of random, fun adventures. It&#039;s so easy to get in the mood for an episode once that opening starts playing.<br />
<br />
As someone who really enjoyed KonoSuba, this sequel offers the same great comedy while putting the characters into new different hilarious scenarios. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the first season.

    In the end of Season 1, I thought the story was actually going to go somewhere. But as soon as I was halfway through season 2, I realized nothing really happened to further the story. I thought season 1 to have some potential so I came into season 2 with some expectations. I was pretty disappointed to be honest. <br />
<br />
3/10 story: <br />
There was little to no story. This anime felt more like a slice of life than an adventure type anime. <br />
<br />
4/10 art:<br />
The art was a big let down compared to the previous season. It seems they just rushed this out to get some profit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242632">
        quickly. People say it fits the anime, but an anime can have good art while having their characters making retarded faces. I feel like detailed retarded faces would be funnier. I honestly think even fan animations on youtube have better quality.<br />
<br />
6/10 sound:<br />
Nothing really caught my ears during the anime, but I never skipped the opening and ending songs at least. <br />
<br />
6/10 characters:<br />
I don&#039;t think I like any characters and that&#039;s in a bad way. In It&#039;s always in Sunny in Philadelphia, they are all assholes to each other, but I like them as characters. But in this anime, they are all assholes and I don&#039;t like their characters. Darkness in any situation is a pervert and is never serious. This really gets annoying and it was never funny in the first place. Aqua reminds me of an annoying version of Shinpachi from Gintama. All she does is scream and complain. She has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Megumin is an alright character though. Besides from the refusal to learn another trick than explosion to help the group, she&#039;s probably the least annoying. Tbh I kinda like Kazuma as a character. He&#039;s interesting and steers away from the usual cliches. He doesn&#039;t take shit from other characters even if they&#039;re a girl and voices his opinions on things. Like equality and such. Most of the characters are presented as is and they don&#039;t seem to have another side to them that we can learn about. <br />
<br />
6/10 enjoyment:<br />
Although this anime overall was disappointing story wise and comedy wise, It still got a few chuckles out of me, just barely. Nothing major really happened. I don&#039;t mind anime with no story or being episodic, but at least be really really funny like Saiki, Gintama, The Daily Lives of Highschool Boys, Nichijou, etc. <br />
<br />
5/10 overall:<br />
I&#039;m not being a hater towards this anime, I just wanted it to go in a different direction. This had the potential to be one of my favorite comedies, but all the jokes were just sex jokes and they explored nothing more than that.

    Consistency is hard to find in comedy. Many shows can be funny some of the time, but few can build off their initial success to keep an audience engaged for the long haul. Konosuba avoids the common pitfalls found in its genre by building off the success of season 1, getting even crazier in its lampooning of trapped in another world tropes and continuing to satirize its characters who find creative ways to fail at life.<br />
<br />
Having already established the character cast and running gags, season 2 is able to hit the ground running immediately throwing viewers into the thick of a prosecution against Kazuma who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242621">
        yet again can&#039;t catch a break from misfortune. It takes a mere 30 seconds to remember why we were so fond of Konosuba to begin with, and the comedy never loses it&#039;s momentum from there.<br />
<br />
If you thought the characters were lazy idiots before, it&#039;s taken to another level where they&#039;re given the stage of an entire season to show just how ridiculous they can be together. Kazuma becomes the one true king of trash, Aqua an even bigger mess of tears and unwarranted self confidence, Megumin commits one adorable act of embarrassment after another and Darkness discovers creative new ways to flick her masochism switch. There&#039;s even a new character introduced in YunYun who&#039;s just as weird as the rest.<br />
<br />
As with any popular anime sequel there&#039;s a lot of criticism being levied towards Konosuba that I&#039;ll address here.  The arguments aren&#039;t necessarily incorrect - the art style is worse and the party doesn&#039;t make substantial progress, but these complaints show a lack of understanding of the point of the anime. This is a parody. They are supposed to suck. The joke is seeing just how many ways they can manage to make their situation even worse than before. The fact that they even managed to exit the town this season is cause for celebration, and of COURSE within minutes of leaving they run into another issue. <br />
<br />
Being beautifully animated wouldn&#039;t make Konosuba&#039;s humor any more effective. Some of the funniest moments are when the characters devolve into a frantic mess of panic like when Aqua cries herself into a moving blob. The opening theme, easiest place for animators to make beautiful, has a scene with all the characters dancing out of model and only a few seconds later is a gorgeously animated Megumin explosion. The final episode has some of the best animation of the Winter season interspersed with some of the worst. It&#039;s all intentional and works well for this show.<br />
<br />
After two strong additions to the comedy genre, Konosuba has inserted itself among the funniest anime in recent memory. A must watch series for those who can enjoy parodical slapstick humor, I pray that a third season is on the horizon for even more adventures from the worst group of travelers in virtual world gaming history.

    The wait is over. Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! 2 or simply KonoSuba 2 is here. The fun ride continues from the first season and we get to see Kazuma and his friends up the usual antics. The plots are funny and the story is mostly based on the manga(which is good thing). I would recommend that you read the manga along with the anime.<br />
<br />
The story progresses as the same in KonoSuba 1. The crew is up to their usual pranks and you get all of them together. Also joining the journey is the cute Chomsuke, who has become a sensation on the internet(I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239706">
        don&#039;t know why). <br />
<br />
The sexy masochist Darkness, cute Megumin(and her cuter friend YunYun), the great Damegami Aqua Sama and our hero Kazuma. along with the their friends continue completing missions. The story continues just from where the first season ended and we see our heroes fighting terrible monsters and doing brave deeds(I am joking).<br />
<br />
The plots are great and so are the sound effects. The only problem is that the animation quality has dropped considerably from the first season. They should really try to improve the animation.<br />
<br />
Overall if you loved KonoSuba and are looking for a healthy dose of laughter, KonoSuba 2 will not disappoint you.

    *THIS REVIEW WILL BE UPDATED EVERY FEW EPISODES*<br />
*Updated as of Episode 9*<br />
<br />
KonoSuba Season 2 can be described simply as &quot;Disappointing&quot; or &quot;Mediocre&quot;. There was lots of hype around the second season, however, thus far, it has been a mess. That&#039;s what I initially thought, however, it seems like KonoSuba Season 2 is just overrated. <br />
<br />
There are many problems with the second season of KonoSuba. Firstly, the art has gotten worse compared to the first season. There are many scenes where it feels like the animators just got lazy and didn&#039;t do their best. The character faces sometimes look weird with the eyes in &quot;interesting&quot; positions.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239704">
        The art isn&#039;t bad compared to other anime, but it isn&#039;t what it used to be, something that the animators could feel proud to have produced. The characters are also less detailed but the backgrounds are fine. It feels like the studio and animators have gotten lazy or maybe just didn&#039;t have enough money. Keep in mind that this anime has lots of fanservice and sorta feels like it could be an ecchi. After a thorough examination, the art isn&#039;t that bad. It&#039;s definitely a downgrade but it isn&#039;t bad. There are some parts where the framerate feels like I am using the crappy internet, but the problem was the animation. (Mostly Ep6)<br />
<br />
The story has been mostly filler for a majority of the episodes that have been aired so far. Nothing serious is happening yet, only time will tell if the story actually gets better. Many episodes have been detached from the main story and do not add anything new. After many episodes, there is finally some story development and things start happening. However, I&#039;m not sure how long this will last. Any plot development is limited by the character&#039;s stupidity. This is getting pretty annoying for me.<br />
<br />
Many new characters have been introduced and some seem promising, however, there is a lack of character development and most characters are one sided two-dimensional characters. The main character Kazuma is as funny as he was in season one. I think he has gotten funnier but the rest of the cast isn&#039;t doing too well. Over time, some of the characters get a bit annoying due to the lack of change and they keep making the same jokes again and again. The characters are more like a bunch of weird traits stuck together with crappy glue. Some of the characters *cough Aqua cough* get pretty annoying at times because she resets all the progress the team makes during the episode. This makes the story more painful to watch. Many of the characters have very large breasts, which can get annoying because of the fact that almost all of the female characters, except Megumin, have abnormally large breasts. If you love large breasts than this anime would be great to watch for you. If not, it may make the whole experience worse.<br />
<br />
The opening and ending songs are good like the first season and there are no problems with the VAs. The background music isn&#039;t memorable at all, like in most mediocre anime. <br />
<br />
However, most people don&#039;t watch KonoSuba for the story, but for the comedy. In my opinion, season two is very enjoyable to watch and even made me laugh out loud a few times, which isn&#039;t too common. My personal enjoyment is pretty good at a 7+. Personally, I don&#039;t want to review anime based on my enjoyment, but I prefer to show you the facts and let you decide if you like it. <br />
 <br />
If you want to laugh a bunch with some fanservice in between, then KonoSuba season two should be on your &quot;Plan to Watch&quot;. I look forward to laughing for 25 minutes each week. It is one of the best anime this season, even though the winter 2017 season is quite weak in my opinion. It is rated too high in my opinion, but typically most comedy anime are rated highly. <br />
<br />
If you want something with a more in-depth plot or characters, then you could consider skipping over KonoSuba unless it gets significantly better later in the season. Even though I do not think KonoSuba is the best thing in the world, it definitely isn&#039;t a bad anime, not even close, but it is also far from being something amazing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading! Feel free to message me if you have any questions or concerns. <br />

    KonoSuba 2 had potential to be much better than what we&#039;ve gotten so far , but it gets bogged down by bad art and animation, characters who are mere caricatures, and an inability to decide what it wants to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
The story is a direct continuation of the previous season. The first episode follows Kazuma as he gets arrested and tries to clear his name. This whole season will essentially follow Kauma and his adventuring band as they face (many) hiccups along their ultimate goal: defeating the demon king. A pretty standard goal for a fantasy setting, but we all know that KonoSuba differs when it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239703">
        comes to its execution. <br />
<br />
<br />
The characters are what made the original season of KonoSuba so unexpectedly entertaining. KonoSuba is a parody of anime set in a fantasy world (see: Sword Art Online), and most of the entertainment comes from how the character tropes from that setting are either subverted or exaggerated. Part of the reason why the first season seemed so entertaining was because of the novelty; what KonoSuba was doing felt like a breath of fresh air in a stale room filled with innumerable &quot;set in a fantasy/game world&quot; anime . However, by now, the novelty has worn off. KonoSuba is doing the same thing with its characters as it did in the first season, but it is no longer as entertaining as it was. <br />
<br />
The characters have a few quirks that provide for most of the comedy in season 2, but by now you should&#039;ve noticed how the characters&#039; personalities are defined almost only by their quirks and nothing else, which starts to become stale. In fact, most if not all of the characters can be summed up in one sentence. Buxom masochistic knight. Chuunibyou explosion loving loli wizard. And so on. So far, there is little character development to speak of. I know that that is par for the course for comedies. Character development isn&#039;t very funny, so it is sacrificed for comedic antics, but KonoSuba is not a plot-less show. As the plot develops without the characters significantly developing, the discord between the character and plot development becomes more and more apparent. And mixing comedy and character development is not impossible, it has been done before. <br />
<br />
<br />
Moving on to the art and animation, this might actually be the worst part of the anime. The art was a significant step down from season 1, even for my untrained eyes. The episodes aren&#039;t consistent either in terms of art quality. Talking specifically about the character designs, they aren&#039;t detailed enough. From certain angles, the characters have a shadow of a nose (which is just a speck) instead of having an actual nose. And the boob sizes were unnerving and unnecessary. I was left wondering how all those women weren&#039;t wearing back braces to deal with the back pain caused by the weight of those boobs. You may think i&#039;m exaggerating, but some of the characters had boobs that were bigger than their heads and had the movements of sturdy water balloons. It was comical, and not in a good way. The anime isn&#039;t following the source material in this regard, so that isn&#039;t the reason. The art otherwise is more or less the same it was in season 1. Bright colors with each main character having a particular color scheme, and pretty backgrounds. <br />
<br />
<br />
The music was decent. The OP is upbeat, the ED is lullabylike, and both fit the show well. The other situational tracks aren&#039;t memorable, but they serve their purpose well. <br />
<br />
<br />
One more point of contention before I wrap up this preview is how KonoSuba is slowly (but surely) going from a parody of the fantasy anime genre to becoming one of the anime it parodies. Assuming you consider parodies to be separate, it is possible to be both the thing you parody and a parody of it (Seto no Hanayome did it, and it did it well), but my first impression from season 1 of KonoSuba was that it was a clear cut parody. Let me clarify: KonoSuba slowly starts incorporating those fantasy anime tropes that it previously lambasted, and rather than a parody it starts becoming a comedic anime set in the fantasy world. <br />
<br />
<br />
To conclude, I know I may have criticized it quite a bit, but KonoSuba 2 is so far still a decent show which will definitely be a source of entertainment for people who enjoyed the first season. I know I will finish watching it (eventually) when it finishes. I just think it could&#039;ve been much, much better than what we have so far.<br />
<br />
Edit: I ended up dropping KonoSuba 2

    And now, I, the contrarian buzzkill present to you, Kono2ba: A middling, even less funny, and overall lower quality product that actually wants to be taken seriously at times. It fails by its predecessor&#039;s standards and it makes me feel like Kazuma. I&#039;ll grab the rotten tomatoes...<br />
<br />
*SPOILERS FOR KONOSUBA 2*<br />
<br />
I&#039;m gonna come clean. I do not like Konosuba. The first half was really funny but the second half was so stale and infuriating that I would not be looking forward to any more. Hell, I only came back due to the fact that I follow all franchises I&#039;ve seen, even the ones I dislike or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242688">
        hate. Even still, one can&#039;t deny that Konosuba had some novelty and genuine laughs, as well as a lot of heart. Kono2ba on the other hand, is a middling season that ends up being a downgrade in almost every way imaginable. It&#039;s more of the same things that made the second half of season 1 vastly inferior to the first half, only with some badly done plot, and a surprising amount of people seek to agree that this is at least inferior to the first season. Now, why the buzzkill viewpoint? Is this season as bad as I say? Well, before I get pelted like an Eris cultist, let&#039;s find out, shall we?<br />
<br />
STORY: 3/10<br />
<br />
Ideally, I wouldn&#039;t even try to rate the score of a comedy, as they tend to have stories that take no precedence and that are mostly episodic: a platform for the rest of the episode. However, this season actually tries to make us take this seriously at points and even reminds us that there is a central plot and not just a background for our characters to do whatever in. That means, I must take it into account. I&#039;m a monster, I know. Even still, with this we can conclude that this ain&#039;t no &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;.<br />
<br />
Episode 1 has got to be the most simultaneously dull and aggravating first episodes to any anime I&#039;ve seen to date. Presents everyone acting uncharacteristically douchey (which is a surprise given how awful some of these people are). Logic fore episode 1 is tossed aside as people make purposefully rash and assholish decisions for conflict that gets resolved at the episode, albeit with Kazuma getting the short end of the stick in the end, which is a common theme for this anime, but I&#039;ll get back to that. Some of the reasonings behind plot points, such as a member of the Demon Lord&#039;s generals surviving an explosion, or the Axis Cult being the worst people ever to their Goddess, or those same people finally worshiping her again and giving her a brand new power (God Requiem), are so damn plot convenient that they hurt. The Drifters level tone-shifts only make things worse, like in the most climactic moment of episode 10. They also like to make us have emotional moments in which we&#039;re supposed to feel for a character or see someone die, only for that to be revoked rather quickly, which sours everything. In the finale, Kazuma and a hot springs overseer are dissolved by a sludge monster that gets frozen, but we never see how they got set free and revived (since that would kill them both and we would need to see them getting revived, but Kazuma remains in the show but the other guy isn&#039;t seen again). There&#039;s that Darkness family subplot in episode 4 that amounts to nothing after all the buildup from the past 2 episodes.The last 4 episodes are spent on a bad Axis Cult arc that hardly does any progression aside from  taking down another bad guy and then returning to status quo, because that&#039;s what a story meant to progress needs. Progression isn&#039;t mandatory to any real stretch in this series, as that is not a major problem like many claim. Even then, the series progresses more than many give it credit for. However, given that the first half is largely just a rehash of jokes that got old in season 1 and season 2 is largely this aggravating detour, it makes me want to opt out.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 2/10<br />
<br />
Even in a comedy, having your characters be static, one-dimensional characters that only get &quot;flandarised&quot; (or having their main personality quirk get taken up to new extremes while being their only personality trait) over time is a bad thing, and will get on people&#039;s nerves, and boy did it ruin everything for me here...again. Let&#039;s start with Kazuma. Poor, poor Kazuma is never allowed to win. That is the golden rule. It&#039;s annoying to see the only sense of reason and human decency be the ultimate punching bag. He&#039;s even more observant this time, bur rarely does that come in handy. Sure, he&#039;s a but of a spiteful prick, but when you consider the toxic shits around him, can you blame him? Megumin is still a one-trick pony with a thing for explosion magic. Now, she also gets sexualized occasionally and is now as much of a prick as the rest of the group, especially towards Kazuma, because the only likable character isn&#039;t allowed to win. Yunyun (introduced in the OVA) is her hopeless and childish rival who doesn&#039;t serve much lurpose aside from being made fun of and having a backstory that, while tragic, is forgotten just as quickly as it was brought up. Darkness is the same as always, but with a little more antagonism towards Kazuma, and her shit was as annoying as ever to the point where it gloriously aggravated one of the villains in episode 5. Sena, the prosecutor that arrests Kazuma in episode 1, is an annoying lady who constantly shouts at him for everything and does nothing because we need an obnoxious authority character. The lord in episode 1 is just your stereotypical sleezebag ruler. Wiz, luckily, is still alright, and has a genuinely badass scene in the finale. Hans is a mediocre final villain, but his reasoning for wanting to fuck up the Axis Cult are reasonable; they are the most horrid, pathetic, stupid, and obnoxious people on the planet, just like their goddess, Aqua. Plus, they hate Eris because we gotta torture an actually decent person more because it&#039;s totally funny! Vanir, the villain in episode 4 who survives due to the convenient reasoning of being able to have multiple copies of himself, is an actually entertaining villain and eventual side-character. Now, to what really killed everything for me, above all else.<br />
<br />
Aqua is the worst character in this show by a long mile, and is one of the most unlikeable bitches I&#039;ve ever seen in fiction. This vain, worthless, problem-causing, obnoxious, pompous, stupid, and pathetic brat gets even worse here with how much they ramp up her stereotypcally bitchy attitude. They even lampshade all of this, but since character development (and, to a lesser extent, plot development) isn&#039;t allowed here, the bitch only gets worse with each passing episode. The only reason she helps out the obviously awful and disgusting Axis Cult, they worship her. The only reason she does decent things is because she hopes for benefit. She is the main source of Kazuma&#039;s suffering and it was never, ever funny for me. A stereotype of a bitch taken to an extreme that gets ramped up even further this season than last season. Luckily Eris is still tolerable and a safe haven for both myself and Kazuma, but she gets constantly shat on as well. I also hate how in the beginning of episode 1, after trying to help Kazuma not get arrested, and they are threatened, both Kazuma&#039;s &quot;friends&quot; and &quot;guild colleagues&quot; rat him out with absoluyte lies and totally betray him. This show often tries to make it seem like the tetrad of party-mates are friends, but they&#039;re played for deception to fuck over Kazuma because making a flawed yet decent person suffer for literally everything has got to be funny. You see my problem? The likable and actually decent people are always shit on, and the one-dimensional pricks only get worse and are just a bunch of obnoxious stereotypes in a fantasy world with different classes that they suck at. It&#039;s even worse here since they repeat each character joke at nauseum when they were already dry by the end of the first season, so there was a complete dearth of new comedy.<br />
<br />
ART: 6/10<br />
<br />
And now for the elephant in the room; the main point of division among the Konosuba 2 viewers. Studio DEEN handled this anime once again, and here&#039;s what I have to say about the visuals. The characters look far inferior, with how they handled going off-model. I get that they did this in order to make the characters even more expressive during jokes involving their reactions, but they should&#039;ve did what season 1 did and reserved that for those moments exclusively instead of making it the default design. It doesn&#039;t even help out those moments well due to how they don&#039;t often fit with the actual emotions the characters have during reactions. The characters are rarely off-model and it becomes really jarring and bad to look at, with the benefits being outweighed by the negatives. Hell, it even effects enemy animals to a lesser extent. Action scenes aren&#039;t well-handled either when involving Darkness. I get what the team was trying to go for, but where Klasky Chupo (the studio that did Ren &amp; Stimpy, Duckman, and Rugrsts) could pull it off, this studio can&#039;t. There are some fantastic animation moments and on the whole, the 2D animation is about on par, but when the rest of the visuals suffer, boy does the value of this fade.<br />
<br />
If that wasn&#039;t bad enough, there are a decent amount of moments with bad CGI involved, such as the bad CGI horses in episode 7 and 8, that one moment of bad CGI water in episode 7, or the CGI sword jabs against Vanir in episode 5. Season 1 never had nearly as many moments, as sporadic as they are here. Sure, some of the nice magic and level up effects are still in display, but not done so enough to help counterbalance all of this. The explosions are still cool to look at, though, and the interior backgrounds can look nice. Still, not enough to save all of this.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 6/10<br />
<br />
Again, the OST isn&#039;t anything interesting or memorable. They take way too long to add some new tracks, but those new ones are actually pretty decent, an are some of the emotional tracks used for the moments of tension and sadness we&#039;re supposed to have. The OP, &quot;Tomorrow&quot; by Machico, is a decent OP, is somewhat catchy and nice, and is much better than the first season&#039;s OP. The ED, &quot;Ouchi ni Kaeritai&quot;, is an ok enough ED, and is slightly better than the first season&#039;s ED. This is just about the only improvement this show has, and even then, it&#039;s not a big improvement, as the music is still overall, meh.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 3/10<br />
<br />
After loathing the first episode of this season, I wasn&#039;t sure how this season could make me feel anything other than bitterness.I was sorta right, but there were a few jokes here and there that I actually liked, such as Kazuma using his magic against people (for either new and satisfying digs at his douche allies, or for call backs to the better season 1 jokes) or Darkness landing on her neck after reveling in the lovely and rowdy pain she was in. That one actually made me bust. All of the other jokes made me feel aggravated, however. As stared constantly, I hated seeing actually decent people such as Kazuma get the shitter by everyone constantly. Along with all of the other recycled jokes from season 1 that were stretched way too thin this time, as well as the Axis BS, and every moment with Aqua, It wasn&#039;t a pleasant time. I was also groaning at how poorly they handled scenes that we&#039;re supposed to take seriously as plot and character moments, like when they are revoked just to give Kazuma another walloping. I didn&#039;t hate is as much as episode 1 made me think I would, but it was still a bitter experience that I don&#039;t want to go back to.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 4/10    RAW SCORE: 38/100<br />
<br />
This season was a middling mess of a sequel that embodied everything I hate about Konosuba while taking itself more seriously, and bring an overall inferior product in terms of quality and production. I can only look back at this with cynicism and say that I am actually tired of Konosuba in general, as well as all fantasy &quot;trapped in a fantasy game&quot; light novel adaptations this show parodies. I&#039;ll give it one thing, though: it made me respect Season 1 a bit more. Well, with all that aid, I bid you adieu.

    I will tell you this now, I&#039;m too lazy to type up a big review. This is basically the main parts you need to know. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really know why people are saying the 2nd season is &quot;overrated&quot; or &quot;messy&quot; but I think It hasn&#039;t changed as much as how some people think. I realized this for long time now, anime gets more criticism than it deserves. I suggest you ignore the reviews rated 6/10 and lower for this anime or you may be lead in their one sided thoughts. <br />
<br />
If you think the change of art or animation makes it worse, your mostly wrong.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240678">
        In my opinion the change makes it funnier and more enjoyable. For instance, the animation in the opening is more entertaining. I watched the opening with great interest, this was due to the art and how the characters acted. Of course this also refers to the actual anime content, its rather unique if I must say so. Not all people will understand the true qualities of the art since they want the very best of everything. What you shouldn&#039;t expect is beautiful scenery and a blissful fantasy world with very detailed characters. When you go into this you should expect it to be less serious and more sketchy for the comedy. So far I&#039;ve only found a few flaws in the art, that was during the ending and in episode 6,7 and 8 area. It was a low camera angle slowly showing Kazuma and co.. I didn&#039;t like any of the character art during that scene. It was difficult to take in seeing the characters I adore like that. Another flaw in the art was the art for Aqua in the ending song, though this might just be my own problem. This might be another problem only for me but I didn&#039;t like the CG for the wagon and the horses. I know that it&#039;s cheaper but it looks very bad. <br />
<br />
The sound is perfectly in sync with what&#039;s going on and works well with the comedy. The soundtracks are 10/10 on specific parts and makes some scenes better than how they would be if it had no sound (Manga as reference). This area is in the clear and only has 1small flaw that is again personal, the ending song. The ending song wasn&#039;t good enough to make me watch it, I usually just skipped. <br />
<br />
If I remember correctly, a few parts didn&#039;t stay true to the Manga. That is only for the content I read in the Manga (since the chapters are rarely released...). I know from the previous season that content gets changed a lot but it&#039;s still funny in the end so I&#039;m not going to continue.<br />
<br />
To be honest I got bored of this at the end. The sudden seriousness with the sketchy characters was kinda... you know eh. The art of Aqua at the end was virtually cr@p and was uneeded. I&#039;m not sure if they did it on purpose to make it funny or what. It took me a long time to finish this and it dropped my score. It may be different for you.<br />
<br />
Why I love it: <br />
The laughs. Honestly though I laughed so much during a episode I swear people heard me. The best trait of the anime is the comedy and the #1 thing I love about it.<br />
<br />
By all means, watch it and see for youself. 8/10 Very entertaining! Thanks for reading.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Episodes watched - 10<br />

    It’s back. 10 episodes of comedic fantasy with Kazuma and the gang. If you’re got a little kid lurking somewhere inside of you, then Konosuba Season 2 is here to please. If you’re familiar with the first season, then expect all the humor to return in full fold. It’s bright. It’s colorful. The plot sounds like it could have been written by someone who was half drunk. But make no mistake about it…Konosuba Season 2 is here again to entertain.<br />
<br />
The second season wastes little time to get the viewers familiar with the main characters again. It has a small cast yet each of them stand

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242620">
        out in their own way. The first episode has Kazuma, our well-known 16 year old hikikomori being in trouble again. With accusations pointed against him in an intimidating trial, the series wastes little time to make him look like a fool. Fans of the show should probably expect this as Konosuba satirizes fantasy drama into a comedy. Kazuma is more or less a fool although the rest of the cast isn’t off better than he is. The point is though, season 2 still knows how to have fun with its character cast. Aqua, Darkness, and Megumin all return in style with their roles. Each of them get their own spotlight in one way or another. <br />
<br />
Perhaps noticeable is the presence of Yunyun, a character that anime viewers may not be too familiar with. She showed up from the OVA episode but in this second season, her role is more expanded as a rival of Megumin. What’s important isn’t just giving the audience a familiarity of her character but also Megumin as well. We learn of her past and in essence, fans of Megumin will be pleased to learn about her besides just being the girl with an obsession for explosions. In addition, the story focuses a bit on Darkness too when she gets involved with a bothersome prince. I can honestly say that without a doubt, the show knows how to make the audience laugh. It’s not just with how the characters’ roles are played out but how this series amplifies their personalities. The sequel combines elements of the first season as well and reintroduces jokes such as frogs swallowing up Aqua in comedic fashion. Oh and who can forget about Kazuma’s panty stealing talent? It’s all back in glory.<br />
<br />
Now I have to admit, Kazuma is character that I find likeable yet repulsive. The show purposely makes him a self-serving character that can make viewers tear their hair out. Obviously, the show is self-aware about this but to be honest, how many times can you really watch such an idiot being idiotic? The other characters are also more or less the same whether it’s Darkness’ machoism, Aqua’s brutal honesty, or Megumin’s lack of self-control. Some may say that it’s because of their stupidity which makes this series entertaining. However, others can think of their lack of development as holding the show back. Regardless, the character cast supplements with the overall humor so be ready for a lot of that in the second season.<br />
<br />
Well, this isn’t news but even before picking up the show, it’s easy to tell that the sequel’s production quality diminished. The first season didn’t have good production quality either although it’s subverted to look that way from the start. It’s like a joke for fans to make fun of regarding the art in the first place. The character facial reactions is still over exaggerated at many humorous segments with visual gags. However in terms of quality, it seems that the sequel did drop the ball more so than the first season. Of course, fan service is still pretty noticeable especially if you’re got a keen eye on Darkness. On the other hand, soundtrack and character voice acting is still generally the same. The OP and ED theme songs still has that atmospheric feel with a catchy tune to go along with its humor. Of course, character voice mannerism still retains their magic so be ready for a wild ride.<br />
<br />
Konosuba is a joke of itself as it sells its comedy through the storytelling and characters. Selling comedy isn’t easy because fans can take it in the wrong way. However, Konosuba is successful because it’s aware of what it’s doing. The second season will take no time to get fans into the show again from the first episode. It’s like going to coming back to school after a Summer break where you’ll expect the expected.<br />

    TL;DR: Whether you love comedy or satire, maybe in the mood for some ecchi memes to quench your kinky desires. KonoSuba is your go to parody to complete all your guilty pleasures! <br />
<br />
&quot;Thou shalt love big breasts, Thou shalt love small breasts&quot;<br />
&quot;Whether you&#039;re a lolicon, a NEET or a questionably-human fan of animal-eared girls… just remember Konosuba is still the best&quot;<br />
<br />
KonoSuba S2 at its core is a comedy anime. Its purpose is to make parody of all the guild adventure style animes like S.A.O &amp; Log Horizon and it goes ahead to do that and more. Though each episode is random and zeroes in on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242619">
        specific anime tropes to ridicule, it still follows the underlying core plot of defeating the devil king. There isn&#039;t complexity in its story-telling but due to its bizarre plot-twists in their randomness, it makes the story unique. The pacing of the show is off-putting and some episodes may feel like filler with its repetitive jokes but because of its comedic &amp; ecchi elements, it&#039;s enjoyable. The ending isn&#039;t as satisfying as the first season but avid fans can expect more of such hilarity in the near future. <br />
<br />
The best part of the show are the main characters. Each of them are very distinct &amp; relatable from one another and this anime continues to set them apart by gregariously highlighting their flaws. It&#039;s hard to pick a fav one between Kazuma, Aqua, Darkness &amp; Megumin thanks to their voice actors. They alone added a whole new dimension to the characters. The villains and the side characters were a bit interesting but nothing out of the ordinary. The major flaw with the entire cast is their ambiguous decision making and future goals or purpose. Some characters even felt like space fillers. Regardless, Darkness and Kazuma will be highly memorable in this series since they had the most growth overall.  <br />
<br />
In terms of art &amp; sound the show went through a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde sort of phase. Due to two different directors taking turns directing the show, you kept going for overtly caricatured faces to overtly epic musical scores. If they found a harmony between these two directors style of delivery the show would flourish more in terms of quality. Still, the hand-drawn animation gives a vibrant feel to the anime and the character designs were always unique. One drawback this show had was the OP &amp; ED song. Unlike previous season, the OP &amp; ED songs aren&#039;t memorable nor catchy. The background OST on the other hand, was decent. <br />
<br />
Regardless, despite its glaring flaws in its unclear storyline, weak side characters and directing switcheroos, being a parody show at its core, this show is enjoyable to watch. It doesn&#039;t take itself seriously and viewers shouldn&#039;t either. They should go in with low expectation and be rewarded with a good comedy series to laugh and meme about. This show offered great quotes and I think it has potential as a show to be re-watched as a group. If you have a few hours to spend and want to watch a hilarious comedy with your friends or by yourself, give this show a watch. I know you will enjoy it!<br />

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Finishing up Konosuba’s second season, I’m very happy to report that it doesn’t suck. For context, Konosuba was going to be the first anime I’ve ever actually watched as it airs. Week after week. However, this show’s first few episodes were less than exceptional and didn’t have many of the elements I enjoyed in the first season. Well, more specifically, nothing in the show changed and I felt as though they are rehashing the entire story for the sake of an unestablished return to norm of this anime sitcom. So, I guess it had too much of what I enjoyed in the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243039">
        season, which made it too similar and therefore tedious.<br />
<br />
What I was ecstatic to see was that Konosuba rebounded gloriously with its second half, as the character dynamics tightened up and the show felt like it was back to what made it fairly enjoyable in its first season, without being overly reliant on established jokes. I’d be hard-pressed to call it anything but an above-average comedy, however, it does just enough to be appreciated in my eyes. With the gang of loveable misfits journeying just past their starting zone, we don’t really get a chance to see anything new. Even as the season concludes in a completely different area, the zone itself never felt as a completely new region. Just a region with a gimmick. But this is a comedy show after all and any talk of character development, world-building, and secondary characters often falls on deaf ears. <br />
<br />
I think there are particular elements that should be included when discussing a show’s return in a second season, though. The ability to craft a new story in a familiar world and setting. Every great sitcom never rests on its laurels and always strives to tell the best stories in the established setting. Whether it is Community, The Office, Arrested Development, or Always Sunny in Philadelphia, each great sitcom elevates something. It can be adding new dynamics, new worlds, or simply raising the stakes by adding unique story elements. <br />
<br />
Konosuba isn’t a great sitcom. Not yet anyway. However, as its thankfully short season wraps up, I finally start to see the kind of picture it is beginning to paint. In a generic yet whimsically ridiculous world full of wacky characters and unfortunately boring creature-design, we get a non-story that does just enough to stand out. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[What is a Second Season] <br />
<br />
After Konosuba’s less-than-stellar beginning to this season, I felt the need to write a long diatribe about why this show completely misses the point of having a second season. Since it isn’t telling a story of any substance, you are instead looking for different elements within a sitcom like this. An overtly cartoony sitcom, at that. These are the goals of a second season. <br />
<br />
1.)You should be raising the stakes. <br />
<br />
2.)You should be making sure those stakes stay raised and are actually something palpable, rather than tacked on for plot devices. <br />
<br />
3.)Don&#039;t rest on your laurels as a writer. As in, don&#039;t rely on past gags to fill up the comedy quota. <br />
<br />
4.)Understand and develop. Have a good knowledge on these characters and further push their interactions into different territories. <br />
<br />
5.)Bring in new, interesting characters to create different dynamics within the show that you haven&#039;t explored before. <br />
<br />
6.)Establish the world.<br />
<br />
These points aren’t all required. There are plenty of great sitcom’s that do one or two for their second season. However, to accomplish a great sophomore year, you want to be applying at least one of these elements. For example, NBC’s critically acclaimed sitcom Community, which just so happens to be the best comedy ever written, in my opinion, employed many of these tactics. For one, it added a background story that raised the stakes throughout the season, it introduced new, interesting tertiary characters that served to three, expand the world. The show also delved into concept-episodes, creating hilariously unique and original parody-esq episodic narratives that didn’t rely on previously established gags of the first season. But that’s Community, it is the best. <br />
Another example is Always Sunny in Philadelphia, where its semi-mediocre first season didn’t speak well for the show. To try and revitalize a show that is distinctly not about character development, they introduced a completely new primary character in Frank, played wonderfully by Danny DeVito. Or what about The Office, which reformed its second season, straying far away from the confines of copying the original show and going into more thematic sitcom storytelling? All of these shows brought something new to a second season. <br />
<br />
Konosuba didn’t. The biggest aspect to a sitcom is the actual comedy. So of course, you must be funny. And if you read my original KonoSuba review where I dissected the meaning of a joke, and how it works, you&#039;d know that the only way a joke works is if it isn&#039;t expected. Comedy works because it is unexpected, the only way an expected and obvious joke would make someone laugh is usually ironically. Comedy needs to stay unexpected to be fresh. The way it accomplishes this is by constantly switching up character dynamics and putting characters into different scenarios. A great example is Always Sunny, which has the entire cast usually embark on more and more audacious journeys as the show progresses, consistently ratcheting up the stakes and creating for new dynamics.I draw so many parallels to Always Sunny because it, similarly, doesn’t focus on a complete narrative and just follows these characters as they do wacky shit. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[The Problem with the First Half]<br />
<br />
This caused instant disappointment with Konosuba because it felt as though it was completely coasting on what made season one stand out. You know that funny gag where one of the characters gives a thumbs up? Or what about the entire concept of using a funny face as a punchline? Remember how it felt authentic in season one because the entire show had this rugged indescribable charm? Well, get ready for the creators becoming aware of that and running the entire concept into the ground. <br />
<br />
The first episode, for some odd reason, decided to make the characters look almost ridiculously ugly. Which is fine, but it completely conflicted with everything else in the previous season. They made the “funny face” gag a running punchline for numerous jokes. This made me instantly get sick of the entire concept. No face is that funny when it is surrounded by other, equally dumb looking faces. Konosuba was about dumb looking dumb people. Not about horrendously misshapen monsters that are also dumb people. <br />
<br />
Thankfully, this is quickly fixed. With the second episode, onwards, the art style miraculously improves and we are back to having high-momentum and movement-based animation which I really enjoyed from the first season. A cartoon is supposed to be fluid and dynamic with movement, by flooding the character with mesh-frames you get infinitely sillier looking scenarios and significantly more stretchy and lively designs. This makes the show feel like a cartoon, which it is. I love that. <br />
That being said, I wish I could say the same about anything else in these first four episodes. The show did this obnoxious narrative structure where it’d just separate characters completely, which made their interactions more predictable and banal. They remove Darkness from the show for the first three episodes for some pointless plotline that goes nowhere. While I’m not a massive fan of Darkness’ character gimmick, at least it added a potential for a new dynamic. Now it is just Megumin relying on her overt character design cuteness and affinity for explosions rather than those being a backline to her actual relationship with the characters. It felt as though these characters were already being flanderized, which is weird because they have literally no distinguishable traits to flanderize apart from their one character gimmick. <br />
<br />
Now we are left with Aqua and our protagonist, Kazuma, who have virtually the same kind of character interaction every god damn time. It is always Aqua being a brat and then Kazuma being dismissive and that leads to more yelling. This got boring in season one and since they split these characters apart at the start of season two, this is all we get to hear for the first three episodes. <br />
One of Konosuba’s strongest points is its knack for having all the characters involved in something. Doing this completely negates what is fundamentally enjoyable in the show. We are left with these hollow character interactions that lack any form of chemistry whatsoever. It felt stilted, awkward, and worst of all, unfunny. <br />
<br />
Konosuba also doesn’t bother adding any secondary or tertiary characters of any interest. There is a red-haired guy that just kind of walks around remarking about the gang’s travels. There’s a cute girl in a uniform whose gimmick is she gives orders, but also gets turned on by some sort of masochism I can’t pin down, which is way too like Darkness for such a small cast of characters. There is also a cat, who’s pretty much just used as a thing to have around so they can sell toys with that cat on them. <br />
<br />
We are left with a wholly sub-average product which is less-funny than the already not-too-funny original, relying too heavily on reusing jokes that worked and pummeling them into the ground. Even the story is the same thing as it was in season one. Except in season one it was natural for them to want money since they need housing, while here it is some shoehorned reason that they need to pay something back. So they are back as the underdogs. But that never lasts long for whatever reason. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[The Rebound]<br />
<br />
Then the show gets better. Substantially better. As the second mini-arc is introduced, I begin seeing that the show is slowly becoming a bit more serialized in a very limp sense of the word. We are starting to see things get call backed to as a tool for a story, rather than a joke. This is where the show begins to shine once again. The animation is looking better, the story it is telling is at least semi-coherent and reasonable of a comedy, and finally, all the characters are back together. <br />
<br />
The character interactions are just as predictable as they always have been. You’ve seen one you’ve seen em’ all. What I do enjoy is Kazuma’s growth as an actual spell-user. We slowly get to see him learning new skills that become useful in the grand scheme of things. This subtle increase in character power is intriguing. It is sad that every other character’s gimmick is so reliant on their power that I doubt we’ll be seeing them grow at all in any way. The scenarios are kept fresh though.<br />
<br />
The gang begins to travel to a different city, which serves to cap the season and create a beautifully animated conclusion. The animation is now consistently impressive to me, especially on this shows insistence that it is definitely a cartoon. It reminds me more of Spongebob than anything. There is so much physical humor with very light-characterization and similar premises executed fairly well that I can just imagine these characters living in Bikini Bottom. Of course we get to see more bottoms in this show. By that I mean there is copious amounts of fanservice which, honestly, I still don’t get. <br />
<br />
These characters aren’t that attractive. In fact, they are silly looking. The sexual fanservice is almost never actually funny, or even used as a joke at all. There are just characters in skimpy outfits posing in odd ways that just distracts you from what is happening. Even poor Megumin is there with all these other scantily clad big-tittied women. Every bend or bow these characters do is always shot in the back so we get a nice, long glimpse of their ass. It comes off as sleazy and distinctly not funny. <br />
Now this is anime and sexualization is nothing new. After all, the biggest selling point of most anime is colorful girls running around blushing. But I can’t help but feel that this show would be markedly more entertaining if it didn’t feel the need to distract you with this element. Konosuba also has a knack of doing something I now like to call “fake subversion”, where a show has the cake and eats it too. If it is setting up for a ridiculously generic anime cliché, such as walking in on someone while they are changing, it’ll point out that is happening… but still do it. For example, earlier on in the show during the awful first few episodes we get to see a totally not shoehorned scene of Kazuma offering to take a bath of Megumin. The cliché is of course pointed out, and Megumin instantly dismisses it. Great. That is where the joke ends, right? The actual subversion. But no, then Kazuma says some dumb petty shit and she strips naked in front of him and you get this weird moment where you are wondering if it’ll lead to a punchline, but it never does. <br />
<br />
Don’t do this. Ever. No one likes this. If you are someone who watches this show to watch a fourteen-year-old anime girl get naked, then you’ll be disappointed since this show is very careful with its nudity as it is a PG-13 product. If you are someone looking for subversive comedy you’ll be insulted because this fake-out subversion just ruins the joke. No one is left happy with this conclusion and that scene particularly frustrated me. That being said, the show actually does well to avoid being overly meta. A big complaint I had about Konosuba&#039;s first season was its over-reliance on pointing out cliches and going right ahead and doing other, equally stupid cliches. This made for a disjointed experience that felt like the writer/s were either unaware of the cliche, or simply lacked the creativity to properly subvert it.<br />
<br />
Regardless, the show gets better. While this can be chocked up to the gang getting back together, it is also worth noting that the change in location helps as well. This show is often praised for its world building, which I find baffling since this show’s world is as generic as it gets. The idea that the monsters in this show are “dumb-looking” would be a good one if they were dumb looking. The only monsters that are silly and over-the-top are the giant funny-looking frogs and the exploding rocks in the show’s opening. Everything else is unfortunately incredible generic. We get this scene of a stampede of animals running towards our hometown. They are virtually just colored big lizards. Their gimmick is they trample things. Then two episodes later we get yet another kind of animal that tramples things, but this time it is an ostrich. In what world is this creative? <br />
<br />
The unfortunate side here is that they can easily do the same kind of over-exaggerated animal designs as they do with their characters. Take preconceived MMO designs and blow them totally out of proportion, much like you did with the main four characters. This could’ve been ground for some funny parody elements, which this show’s second season is very light on. This show was never quite a parody, however, it definitely had MMO themes to it. Everything from the quest text to Kazuma’s reaction to things to the way abilities and learning them works. It hardly ever satirizes the concepts behinds these things, which is unfortunate since when it does it often leads to the funniest scenes in the show. As I’ve said in my season one review, this show is at its funniest when it does these parodies. It is also its least funny when it relies too heavily on being sexual. Which just comes off as plodding and lame. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[Conclusion]<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, Konosuba is still likeable. I think after it came back from the disappointment of the first few episodes, we returned to what made even the more tedious parts of season one likeable. Which is the characters in this setting. They aren’t developed or interesting, but they are comfortable. This show can be defined as comfortable. It is an extremely easy and light-hearted watch. Nothing about it is daring or shocking, it is just something to throw on because it makes you feel good and occasionally has you chuckle under your breath.<br />
<br />
I wish that this show didn’t have such a weak start this season because I feel like if it started strong, much like season one, it could’ve been equally as good, while still unfortunately relying on very predictable character interactions. The reason for this is because as you watch these characters’ adventure together, no matter how uninspired these adventures may be, you begin to enjoy watching them. Much like comfort food. <br />
<br />
Konosuba is very much like a classic kid&#039;s cartoon. It can just as easily be some weekly webisode series that lasts three minutes and I don’t think I would siphon anything different from it. It is that palatable. I remember arguing with someone about the show. They kept saying that it is like Seinfeld or Always Sunny in the sense that these characters are assholes and that’s where the comedy is buried. But I couldn’t help but disagree. These characters are dumb; they aren’t assholes in any sense of the word. The comedy in this show is well-meaning to a fault. If they were written like douchebags stuck together, like Always Sunny, the comedy would have to be significantly darker to be affective. In one scene, Kazuma, probably our more morally ambiguous character rejects the offer of free money because he doesn’t believe he’s earned it. If that isn’t light-hearted I don’t know what is.<br />
<br />
That is the heart of Konosuba and its second season. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Or, in Konosuba’s case, the more things stay the same, the more things stay the same. Because while it doesn’t do anything new, I can’t hate it for that as much as I may want to. It attempts to recapture the essence of season one and I think, for many, it did. Everything from the opening, which is actually better than the season one opening, and the closing track, which isn&#039;t better, all try to convey the same message. The most different element it employs is a ampler use of serialized storytelling, which I actually enjoyed for the most part. I hope that this show becomes a journey to remember, by creating consistently funny foundations to a big journey these characters could go on. But until that moment, I’m content with simply calling it a producer’s blessing on this wonderful world. <br />

    The first season of Konosuba was a surprise hit because it had great character interactions, well done comedy, good consistent visuals and a good soundtrack.<br />
When Konosuba 2 was announced, I was really excited because I wanted too, see this characters again but this time actually have character development. <br />
After binge-watching all 10 episodes of Konosuba 2 and I am going too, be real honest. Season 2 are far inferior too, season 1 in a lot of way.<br />
Why do I think Konosuba 2 isn’t as good as season 1?  You will find in this review<br />
Hello everyone this are Shawn aka PhantomKurata and welcome too, my review

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242721">
        of Konosuba 2 and with that out of the way let’s begin.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story. <br />
Honestly theyre are hardly story in this season whatsoever.<br />
It&#039;s just Satou and his gang just traveling around places doing comedic/pervy<br />
things from start too, finish without any story/character buildup whatsoever.<br />
That’s right this season of Konosuba has no objective, no build-up, hardly any world building and overall its feels more like a slice of life anime than an adventure/fantasy show that’s feels like filler.<br />
<br />
The lack of any story really annoyed this season at the end of the first season it hinted that the show was going somewhere due too, the events of the last season. Instead Konosuba 2 are a generic fantasy anime that doesn’t do much expect for comedy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now let’s talk about Konosuba’s comedy. The comedy in the first was greatly handled because one it was actually funny; two the comedy hardly repeats itself and three the character interactions during those comedy moments were funny and refreshing<br />
<br />
Not even the comedy can save this season in-fact the comedy here lost its charm completely.<br />
Its repetitive, abuse, predictable and not too, mention its honestly really boring seeing the same type comedy being used over and over and over! This are not good writing whatsoever. <br />
It’s just lazy, cheap and generally annoying.<br />
<br />
I know Konosuba are comedy anime set in a fantasy world but come on take more risks.<br />
Baka and Test are a show that great comedy that are mostly handled well and fresh. Also unlike Konosuba the characters in Baka and test actually do developed as well as having great and interesting backstory&#039;s especially in season 2.<br />
Also, Baka and Test has story that actually progresses theyre were some filler but least Baka and Test has great comedy and character chemistry too, back it up. <br />
<br />
Overall the story of KonoSuba are a disappointment.<br />
4/10 <br />
<br />
Characters. <br />
Seriously what the hell happened too, this characters after the first season. <br />
How do this characters become more repetitive and annoying? <br />
Not too, mention theyre are no character development whatsoever?<br />
<br />
Satou are still the same character from season 1 expect here he has no character development and he always does the same comedic/pervy things from season 1.<br />
I have nothing more too, say about this character.<br />
<br />
Next we have Aqua...<br />
What the hell happened too, you?<br />
Okay I liked Aqua in the first season because she was charming and funny but here she&#039; has been reduced too, an unlikeable and whiny character whom cries a lot. Not too, mention her jokes are no longer funny. Hell some of her jokes made me cringe. I really dislike Aqua here. <br />
<br />
Megium are the only character that I liked in this season.<br />
She are still funny as ever, very likable and she&#039;s still an entertaining character that I personally liked.<br />
<br />
Like with Satou Darkness are still the same character from season 1 whom hardly changes.<br />
<br />
The rest of the characters are all generic stereotypes in a fantasy setting whom do generic fantasy things.<br />
<br />
Overall the characters in Konosuba 2 are disappointing <br />
<br />
4/10<br />
<br />
Visuals.<br />
The first season of KonoSuba has some good visuals that was consistent for the most part. <br />
Like with the comedy the visuals in KonoSuba are a downgrade filled with inconstant art and lackluster animation that can get choppy at times. <br />
I still question Studio Deen for animating four shows at the same time because it’s clearly shows how much effort that Deen put into season 2.<br />
Also, theyre are more fan-service this time around and like with the comedy are abused, repetitive and annoying.<br />
The only good thing I can say about the visuals are the backgrounds because like with the first season the backgrounds are well detailed and colorful<br />
4/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound.<br />
The soundtrack of KonoSuba are the same as the first season. <br />
I have really nothing too, say about the soundtrack because it’s still an enjoyable soundtrack.<br />
<br />
I personally wasn’t a fan of the opening of Konosuba 2 Tomorrow because the opening itself was kinda out of tone and didn’t had the charm of the first opening called Fantastic Dreamer.<br />
The ending theme Ouchi ni Kaeritai are a really good ending theme that fits the tone of the show really well.<br />
<br />
The voice acting are good for what it are.<br />
It still needs a dub because like with season 1 it will add more charm too, the show.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts.<br />
Repetitive and annoying are the best words too, describe Konosuba 2.<br />
<br />
The story goes nowhere, most of the characters are a massive downgrade from the S1 counterparts with no charm too, them, terrible comedy, inconstant visuals with choppy animation and the soundtrack that the good thing I can say about this show.<br />
<br />
This are how you don&#039;t do a squeal!!!<br />
<br />
I personally don&#039;t recommend watching this squeal unless you are a die-hard fan of Konosuba.<br />
<br />
In short Konosuba 2 are a average show that ruined the charm that the first season had.<br />
<br />
I give Konosuba 2 a 5/10 <br />
<br />
Anime recommendations <br />
Baka and Test<br />
Slayers<br />
Log Horizon<br />
Gintama<br />
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash<br />
Excel Saga<br />
<br />
Anyway this has been Shawn aka KurataLordStage and I will see you guys next time.

    I loved Konosuba season 2.  You get more of the comedy you loved from season 1, plus additional bonuses.<br />
<br />
There still really isn&#039;t a story.  Defeating the devil king was clearly just an excuse to have Kazuma enter the world. It&#039;s still a great and simple excuse to get everything started though.<br />
<br />
Almost everyone is saying that the art quality dropped from the first season.  I personally didn&#039;t notice a huge difference.  The art was still really good and added to what the show was trying to convey.<br />
<br />
The sound is very similiar to season 1, but I still love the music.  Konosuba&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242655">
        soundtrack isn&#039;t my favorite, but it&#039;s still really good and it really helps with making the show more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
The characters are still the same too.  The whole cast is in what I&#039;d  call the &quot;love them or hate them&quot; category.  Season 2 does provide some more background information and development for the main crew (Kazuma, Darkness, Megumin, and Aqua) as well as Wiz.  You finally get to see Wiz use some of her magic.  <br />
<br />
Overall, I love this season.  I like it at least as much as season 1, if not more.  I recommend watching this season if you like the first one.

    Konosuba 2 Is Amazing<br />
Its Gods Gift on this wonderful world and let me tell you why<br />
Story: The story is consistent but because this is a comedy anime it didn&#039;t delve deep into the story Besides Darkness and maybe Aqua.<br />
<br />
Art: People keep saying the art is bad BUT IT IS NOT, the art may look mediocre but that&#039;s because it was created for comedy, so they want it to look funny for emphasis. If you look at their faces the entire episode the way it is drawn and put together with their words and sound it&#039;s simply beautiful.<br />
<br />
Sound: The sound is amazing Unlike last seasons bland

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242306">
        opening and Meh soundtrack, This one is memorable full of Perfectly Timed Sounds to go with what&#039;s going on. Their voice actors are amazing props to Kazuma, Darkness, and Megumin&#039;s voice actors for amazing work, it&#039;s almost like it&#039;s real the way they voice their characters like they are those characters is simply amazing.<br />
<br />
Character: The characters of this season are given depth along with new characters that when added to the cast make it even funnier, so much can be said on this I can only sum it up in one sentence &quot;Wow, *Wink and duck away*&quot;<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I enjoyed this anime because it is simply too lovable to hate.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10 Needs more explosions (Subject to change to ten once more explosion is seen)

    First of all, I have never written a review of an anime in my life, but this is surely something I&#039;v had on my mind for quite some time.<br />
<br />
*spoiler free*<br />
<br />
KonoSuba Season 2, a second round of the loveable and lively characters we saw come to life in the first season of the show, being this second season a direct continuation of where we left off in season 1.<br />
<br />
Many of you who want to watch this show after watching the first season might be wondering why the reviews for this show rank so badly, and that would be a fair question, but it all boils down

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241855">
        to how some people simply came into the show expecting exactly what it was not meant to be.<br />
<br />
KonoSuba Season 2 stands exactly the same as its prequel, its the story of an unlikely love-hate relationship between a group of friends brought together by sheer coincidence sharing adventures in the harsh reality of a Fantasy/Medieval world.<br />
<br />
-Art 8/10-<br />
<br />
The first critique people give this show is the art, wich I can guarantee isn&#039;t fair, since the art presented in this show is some of the most fleshed-out to ever come out of a modern anime, imediately giving off a goofy vibe while still being aesthetically pleasing.<br />
It&#039;s very colorful and lively and it fits the characters extremely well, and when all of that is brought together it really makes the show come alive.<br />
I think that given the budget cuts the animation team was given, they really did the best job they could and it doesn&#039;t disapoint at all.<br />
<br />
-Story 8/10-<br />
<br />
Where do i even begin, story, this is where the anime fails for most people.<br />
First of all, KonoSuba never set out an objective for itself, apart from all the &quot;Defeat the Demon King&quot; stuff, wich only exists to drive the characters forward.<br />
So what exactly is the story behind this fantastic and magically show? Its exactly what&#039;s described in the first season of the show, the mundane struggles of a NEET brought into the type of world he thinks he is the most accomodated with and his party of extremely weird people.<br />
Its an extremely clever comedy jab at the so-ever satured genre of &quot;brought into another world&quot;, coming to life in a comedy-driven show.<br />
So if you expected this beautiful show to have a dark turn and suddenly become serious and grim, don&#039;t even bother watching, but if you liked season 1 for what it was and want to see more, im sure you won&#039;t be disapointed.<br />
<br />
-Sound 9/10-<br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t really much to say sound wise, its consistent and has a beautifuly composed opening and ending, that goes perfectly along with the tone of the show.<br />
<br />
-Characters 9/10-<br />
<br />
This is where the show really shines, its characters, they are unique and down-to-earth, each one of them stands out for themselves and its really hard to pick a favourite one in the bunch of loveable dorks this show presents us with, most of them carry out from season one, but this second second season still introduces some new ones that are equally good and enjoyable as the likes of YunYun (If you haven&#039;t watched the first OVA that will be the first time seeing her).<br />
<br />
-Enjoyment 10/10-<br />
<br />
This is heavily opinion based, but there are some good reasons for enjoying this show so much, its exactly what i expected it to be and it feels like time well spent, it brightens the mood of anybody watching it and even though its kind of an episodical anime its hard to feel bored or annoyed on how the show isn&#039;t going anywhere especifically because there is just so much to look at in the world of this show that none of it feels like wasted time.<br />
I can guarantee anyone reading this that the enjoyment they had in season 1  will surely make them company throughout the enterity of this second season.<br />
<br />
-Overall 9/10-<br />
<br />
Given all the reasons stated above I urge every single person that liked season 1 or any other comedy animes to watch this show and form their own opinion on it, in the end reviews here are mostly the opinion of individuals on a certain Anime, and when in doubt you should always give it a try, even if other people don&#039;t enjoy it.<br />
<br />
The Amazing world of Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! Season 2 awaits you, and it&#039;s certainly worth your time.<br />
Thanks to anyone who bothered to read my review this far, and i hope it helped clearing some uncertainty over the reviews this show had been recieving.

    The main thing that I want to convey to you is that I really enjoyed this series! It made me laugh a lot in unpredictable ways and I loved the characters. For me is wasn&#039;t the type of anime that I thought about in the week between each episode but one that I really enjoyed coming back to each week and was really sad when I realised it only had 10 episodes and I had watched them all. So if you want something chill to watch that will make you laugh this is the show for you!<br />
<br />
The first series of KonoSuba was probably one of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242646">
        the most enjoyable shows I have watched and having just finished the second season I have to say that season 2 was just as good if not better than the first.<br />
<br />
The story revolves around a group of misfits and their adventures in a fantasy world. The story is quite slow pace but being a comedy that the story isn&#039;t always the best part of the show. I always found every episode was always very funny and this for me made up for the lack of progression in the story. I can see this story progressing a lot in future seasons (knock on wood).<br />
<br />
What is a big part of the humour is the characters. In this season you get to see different sides of characters and looking back at season 1 they have changed a lot in my opinion. Kazuma the main protagonist was a human who got dropped into the world after he died. He has lots of &quot;quirky&quot; skills that seem pointless but always seem to help out in life or death situations. He hasn&#039;t stopped being a scumbag but seems to care more about the party and has taken up more of a leading role which is good to see. Aqua is a Godess that was bought down to the world by Kazuma. She is a very funny character and always seems to get into the worst situations despite being arguably the most capable person in the group being a god and all. Darkness is a masochistic crusader who can&#039;t hit a thing with her sword but loves to take the hit for her companions in battle. She always seems to get excited in the wrong moments which is what makes her so great. Megumin (best girl) is an over powered wizard who can only use one spell that completely uses all her energy for that day, a bit of a glass cannon.<br />
<br />
The art is very fitting and the animation is pretty good, especially the explosions. I didn&#039;t really notice the sound much but for me that&#039;s a good thing because it means I didn&#039;t get bored of it which I have done with other series.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are still reading this then thank you for taking the time. This was my first review and I&#039;m not that good at writing and tend to write all my thought onto the page so if you have any pointer that you would care to share then drop me a message!

    It&#039;s kinda weird to see a second season of a show with such a drastically higher rating than its previous season while most of the top reviews are negative. So who&#039;s right? The people writing detailed reviews, or the people just throwing out high ratings? <br />
<br />
Well, they both are.<br />
<br />
I think the issue is that the reviewers&#039; criticisms aren&#039;t incorrect (the art and animation have gotten worse, the stakes haven&#039;t really been raised, etc.), they miss the point. KonoSuba is a comedy, and simply enough, KonoSuba has gotten funnier.<br />
<br />
Season 1 was good, no doubt, but in the first season it needed time to establish characters, running

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241500">
        jokes, it was a lot of establishing. This season, we&#039;re settled in and the comedy is flourishing. You can complain about how bad the art and animation look, but do you really think it&#039;s not intentional in this case? For what this show is, it&#039;s an IMPROVEMENT. Some of the biggest laughs I&#039;ve had from the show as a whole were just when Kazutrash or Aqua flips out, starts hyperventilating, and devolves into an off-model, under-detailed mess of panic and fear. The show&#039;s &quot;shitty&quot; look gives it character that it was kinda missing last season when it was only kinda shitty.<br />
<br />
The atmosphere of the show&#039;s setting and humor has also made a very slight (but welcome) shift from a clever, but pretty simple parody to It&#039;s Always Sunny in Slayersville. The characters have been given the platform to show off just how pathetic, useless, and depraved they are and they&#039;ve run with it. The &quot;fight&quot; between Kazutrash and Darkness in episode 4 is the hardest I&#039;ve laughed at anything this season easily and it perfectly exemplifies how great the character dynamic is now.<br />
<br />
While their hasn&#039;t been a drastic rise in &quot;stakes&quot;, the plot IS moving forward, and two more characters will soon become more important (Wiz and Eris). But to those who complain that the plot isn&#039;t advancing fast enough, I&#039;d ask if you get what this show is even trying to say? The characters are lazy, idiotic miscreants. Why would they aggressively pursue greater dangers? One of the bigger jokes is that whenever they get a hold of some money, Kazutrash says &quot;Fuck finding the Devil King, I&#039;m rich, I can eat good and stay inside all day&quot;. The plot usually hunts THEM down, which is exactly how it should be given our characters.<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t a plot driven show. The author intentionally set up the path to the end being so vague so that he can end it at any point, or never end it. It&#039;s a vehicle for comedy, just as One Piece is a vehicle for action and adventure. This isn&#039;t a show you watch for eye candy. Its visual based tactics aren&#039;t there to impress, they&#039;re there to evoke laughter, much like GTO&#039;s own terrible art. It achieves its goal in spades, moreso than season 1, and that&#039;s really all that matters.

    Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! 2<br />
<br />
The second season of the well-known Isekai parody title didn&#039;t disappoint, but it didn&#039;t surprise me either, despite all the skepticism.<br />
<br />
Here, too, every possible aspect of the well-known &quot;Isekai&quot; titles is taken up and ridiculed and exposed. In the sense, yes I love that kind of ridiculous exaggeration.<br />
The characters also made these scenes look authentic.<br />
<br />
It should also be noted that you should still not expect a -story- here, as the series is still a sheer comedy or at least an attempt to be one.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this season had the same weaknesses as its predecessor. There were significantly more episodes than

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400238">
        actually creative jokes to compensate for this. Mostly there were 1-2 subtle moments per episode in which you could either laugh or at least grin. The rest of the jokes in the episodes had no structure or actual content. It was mostly dull walking around, screaming, and exploding. What an 8-year-old child who is a fan of old-school cartoons would find funny, but none of them fit into the age group of this series.<br />
Among other things, the sex jokes lost some of their charm. Right from the start, you were levelless, I am aware of that. However, Konosuba had this &quot;open&quot; and &quot;innocent&quot; way of representing these sex jokes. Which had simply lost its charisma over the course of the episodes.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I would almost say that it is enough to watch a &quot;Best of KonoSuba&quot; video on Youtube with a duration of 10 minutes to internalize the best jokes without context. Since Konosuba has hardly any other strengths, apart from the wacky and open characters, you can save yourself a lot of time.<br />
<br />
On average, this Show is still not a disappointment, an average comedy that does not have much creativity but can still convince. Unfortunately, I&#039;ve seen dominantly better titles in this area, which is why this series hardly sees any land.<br />
<br />

    In all honesty I was expecting more from this series, especially since I heard a lot of good thing about it. I wouldnt say this was a bad series though, since  I laughed a several times and it had good vibes, so overall I enjoyed it. However...<br />
<br />
The story really didnt go anywhere. The characters development was non-existent, and they became boring after the a while. They didnt change at all trough the story. They was the same screaming idiots the whole time (which was funny at first, but it became stale). Which is a shame since the characters could have been interesting. Lalatina&#039;s masochistic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review392893">
        personality  had the pontential to be really good and unique (and really funny), but after a while even she became boring, since her only personality trait was her raging masochism... Megumi had the potential too, but without character development she wasnt that interesting either in the long run. Aqua... Its says a lot that I had to google what was her name even though I just finished the anime an hour ago.<br />
<br />
The relationships between characters was set in stone from the first minute, which is huge issue since this is a harem anime. The same jokes and the same episode structure became repetative.<br />
<br />
In summary nothing really happend in the anime, and nothing really changed. It wasnt a bad experience though, but nothing expectional either.
