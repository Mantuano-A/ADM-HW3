    Stretching towards 40 years since its original broadcast on 1 April 1970, &amp;quot;Ashita no Joe&amp;quot; is one of the very first few sports anime and almost certainly the first to revolve around boxing. Based on the manga by Takamori Asao and Chiba Tetsuya, both the manga and anime are noted for being pioneers of the genre as a whole, and are considered classics.<br />
<br />
Story: Joe is a deadbeat. He is a troubled orphan who chooses to abandon his orphanage in an attempt to find his own way of life. Walking through the slums of Tokyo, he encounters a drunkard as he is hurled from a bar.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2776">
        Joe disregards the drunk, and ends up in a scuff with members of the local gang. After quickly disposing of the gang members, the drunk is impressed by Joe&#039;s instincts and fighting ability. It is revealed that the drunk is Dampei Tange, a former boxing instructor, as he vows to straighten up and fulfill his dream of creating a world champion in Joe. Sounds like a typical shounen sports series in most senses, but it must be remembered that this was the story that pioneered the genre and inspired many future similar titles, and for that it is held by me in highest regard.<br />
<br />
Art: The artwork will most likely be hard for the modern anime fan to accept, what with its charcoal-like feel and overall scratchy look, but if you have the right frame of mind to appreciate the fact that it is from an era of anime long past it is sufficient in its own right. The animation is fairly consistent and portrays the action in just the right way to get the viewer involved. Just don&#039;t go into it expecting &amp;quot;Hajime no Ippo&amp;quot; standard animation.<br />
<br />
Sound: On the sound front, viewers must again appreciate the age of the anime. The opening and closing themes are extremely old-fashioned and do not exactly get your heart pumping in the same way a modern soundtrack might. Having said that, the in-episode soundtrack does contain some pretty classic tracks and certainly serve their purpose. The voice acting is more or less perfect, with each actor giving a truly believable performance for their respective characters. Really top stuff.<br />
<br />
Character: &amp;quot;Ashita no Joe&amp;quot; thrives in its array of characters. In the beginning, Joe is our protagonist and is a rebellious youth always looking to cause trouble. It&#039;s hard to like a character such as him, and at times you may want to backhand him for being so damn arrogant, but it his arrogance that drives the series initially. As times passes, he becomes tamer and you&#039;ll find yourself cheering him on from the sideline as he steps into the rings rather than wishing for his demise. Tange also sees a dramatic change, going from being a lowlife drunk good-for-nothing, to becoming a respectable man, fulfilling his role as the coach in the same way that, say, Mick does in the &amp;quot;Rocky&amp;quot; films. Later down the line, Nishi serves his role as the friend despite their troubled beginnings, Yohko as a potential love interest for Joe, and Rikiishi as a heated rival. I could go on and on about the many wonderful and colourful characters, but I would never be able to provide a complete analysis. There is just so much depth.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: At times, it can be downright depressing, but for all the right reasons. The series doesn&#039;t set out to be a happy series, and in that it excels. It manages to capture the emotion of the viewer perfectly, and so, in all respects, this is one of the most enjoyable series I have seen, and it really opened up the doors for similar series down the line. Frankly put, if there was no &amp;quot;Ashita no Joe&amp;quot;, manga and anime may not be the same today. It is not often that the death of a fictional character can warrant a real-life funeral. That&#039;s just how important this series is.<br />
<br />
Overall: Anyone with even so much as a passing interest in sports anime should consider this a must-watch. In Japan it is considered the king of its genre and rightly so. Even nearly 40 years on, the series never fails to provide a refreshing and exhilarating experience. If you can get past the age of the series, consider this highly recommended.

    While there are some earlier anime that are well-regarded, Ashita no Joe is often considered to be the anime medium&#039;s first true work of greatness. In many ways, it does hold up as the benchmark that it is regarded as being - but in many other ways, it requires a &quot;good for its time&quot; disclaimer, as do many of its contemporaries.<br />
<br />
From a production standpoint, Ashita no Joe has actually held up exceptionally well compared to many other 70s anime. While it does have animation errors all over the place, the rough, sketchy way in which it is drawn makes it look highly stylized for its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192650">
        time, and due to the rough nature of its art style, the animation errors are far less glaring than they would have been in something cleaner-looking. This style also translates to some very well-animated fight scenes, with surprisingly minimal use of stock animation. My only complaint regarding the production is some of the voice acting, which often sounds monotonous and amateurish. There are a few standouts, though, such as Shuusei Nakamura&#039;s take on Rikiishi Tooru, as well as Robert and Carlos being a rare examples of foreign characters in an anime having an audible accent (although why Venezuelans are speaking Engrish is never explained).<br />
<br />
The dialogue has aged much more badly, though, as around 90% of sentences spoken in this anime contain the word &quot;Joe&quot;, most likely uttered thousands of times over the course of the series, which gets about as grating as you&#039;d expect.<br />
<br />
This is a symptom of one of AnJ&#039;s most obvious flaws - everybody is obsessed with Joe to an unrealistic extent. This would be understandable if he were particularly charismatic or likeable, but Joe is an antisocial drifter whose earliest actions in the series mostly consist of theft and beating people up. As part of his character arc, Joe starts off as much of an anti-hero as possible, so the fact that he&#039;s regarded as though he were some kind of messiah by most people who know him makes very little sense.<br />
<br />
My single biggest complaint with the series is Joe&#039;s loyal followers, a band of delinquent children who clamour over Joe for reasons that are never adequately explained. They provide most of the show&#039;s comic relief, which is never actually funny. They serve no purpose in the plot other than to distract us from it. Their parents also seem to be disturbingly okay with their (sometimes near-suicidal) devotion to a homeless, dangerous, ex-con drifter who has involved them in criminal activity.<br />
<br />
This show&#039;s biggest strength, on the other hand, lies with the rest of its characters. More than boxing, this show is about becoming a better person. Many characters development revolves around this - Joe starts off as a juvenile delinquent, and progresses to someone trying to make a name for himself. Nishi also begins as a juvenile delinquent, but moves towards becoming a well-adjusted member of society. Danpei quits drinking and dedicates himself to restoring his career as a boxing coach.<br />
<br />
The highlights of the cast are Joe&#039;s two main rivals - Rikiishi Tooru, and Carlos Rivera. Anime has a strong history of great rivalries, and Rikiishi is perhaps the first great rival in the whole medium. He represents the opposite of Joe - where Joe is rash, easily-angered, and impulsive, Rikiishi is suave, calm, and collected. The direction he takes when he finally finds a boxer worthy of his rivalry in Joe makes for the most compelling arc in the show. Carlos, on the other hand, is supposed to be a clear parallel to Joe, coming from a similar background and rising from his upbringing in the slums.<br />
<br />
For all its ups and downs, Joe&#039;s story is an engrossing one, and the great characterisation makes it easy to become invested in Joe&#039;s developing career. The beginning is quite poor, but once the prison arc starts and Joe begins taking boxing seriously, it&#039;s easy to get hooked. The Rikiishi arc in particular is a masterpiece in its own right, and is unfortunately impossible to discuss in detail without tremendous spoilers. Joe is worth watching even just on the merits of that arc.<br />
<br />
Final Words: It takes a bit of patience to get into, but overall, I would recommend Joe as one of the better series I&#039;ve seen from the 1970s.<br />

    Welcome to what I call one of the most epic animes ever. Try to imagine a Japanese version of Rocky, and this is what you get. But I say Rocky is the American version of Ashita no Joe since Rocky came out in 1976, and the original manga of Ashita no Joe started in 1968 and ended in 1975. But anyway, they share the same charms and are both iconic to their respective nations in their owns rights. The story is reasonably paced and easy to follow, and tells a life story about a young man&amp;rsquo;s career and his struggles in and out of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8619">
        ring. Initially, Joe was just a bum who had nothing but the clothes on his back. He created controversy that makes Mike Tyson look like Disneyland but yet he was down to earth and had this aura to him in his neighborhood in the slums of Tokyo as if he were Manny Pacquiao in the Philippines. Despite how you can describe Joe in a personal level, it&amp;rsquo;s bizarre to see him as a hero at the same time. I just find it unique that in real life, people can react the same way when some athlete publicly acts crazy and doesn&amp;rsquo;t apologize for it, and we don&amp;rsquo;t really scorn them to some capacity sometimes.  The other characters are also unique and some may not be of significant use, but they still have some kind of overall unforgettable impact in advancing the story.<br />
<br />
Yes, the art and animation are old and outdated which is something that many people today can&amp;rsquo;t really get past by which I can understand, but if you&amp;rsquo;re a type of person that can still appreciate the old Rocky movies or old movies in general, then this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t bother you. After all, Chiba Tetsuya, the artist of the manga still draws in that manner to this day and if he were to draw the manga all over again for today, he&amp;rsquo;d still do it the same way. But getting past the outdated style, it still does an excellent job of bringing out the expressions in the characters and their builds are well appropriate for their respective weight classes. It&amp;rsquo;s also interesting to note that with some characters, they will show age and change such as Joe, Nishi, and Noriko. They will look more refined, taller, and have different looking hair to symbolize that they are growing up which I found very unique. I also thought they did a great job of making Rikiishi look dehydrated to make it to Joe&amp;rsquo;s weight class at 118 pounds, bantamweight, when his best weight class is at 126 pounds, featherweight.<br />
<br />
Sorry to bring up another Rocky comparison, but the fights are on the same epic level and Joe&amp;rsquo;s fighting style can be compared to that of the Rocky Balboa character himself. They are both in no ways text book boxers like Floyd Mayweather, Winky Wright, or Pernel Whitaker, and they are go for broke brawlers like Ricardo Mayorga, Rocky Marciano, Antonio Margarito, and Daniel Ponce De Leon. Every punch they throw, is intended to knock you out. Every fight in Ashita no Joe is truly different from the last and brings a different kind of flavors of intensity and will keep you on the edge of your seat. As I described Joe&amp;rsquo;s fighting style, sometimes you think you&amp;rsquo;re watching a street fight instead of a boxing match and I mean a brutal street fight. And the ending fight when Joe finally get his shot is one of the best pieces of work I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. Nothing, and I MEAN NOTHING in American, Japanese, Korean, or Mexican or whatever country&amp;rsquo;s animation or cinema industry can ever come near that fight except real life bouts such as the trilogy between Erik Morales and Marco Antonio Barrera, or the Thrilla in Manila, and the final fight sets up for the best ending you can ever get.<br />
<br />
The seiyuu cast is wonderfully top notch. Johnny&amp;rsquo;s singer Aoi Teruhiko does the voice of Joe Yabuki. He does an excellent job of making Joe sound like a smart ass. Ryuusei Nakao, the voice of Freeza in DBZ, in some versions has played Carlos Rivera and current J-Drama actor Kishibe Shiro does the voice of Nishi. Nishi always came across to me as a Japanese version of Lenny from Mice and Men at a physical level and his voice does come across in that manner also, but his way of speaking symbolizes his good intended heart as well. Unfortunately, some of the other cast members have now passed on but they created a legacy with this anime. <br />
<br />
Naturally, the music is just something that defines the old school feel to it. A strange way to describe it that, it&amp;rsquo;s just so masculine and touching at the same time. It&amp;rsquo;s about conquering adversity and how it will make you a man. But other than that the soundtrack is just one of the passionate singing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard.<br />
<br />
Well, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if Hajime no Ippo fans will like this, but I say if you&amp;rsquo;re more of a fan of Rocky, than this is probably more for you, while Hajime no Ippo on the other hand, tends to have more of the charms and appeal of the Karate Kid. Many other animes and mangas since then have paid tribute to this wonderful classic by restating lines or re-enacting scenes from it such as episodes and chapters of GTO, Fushigi Yuugi, Berserk, FLCL, Ranma &amp;frac12; and Urusei Yatsura. If you want to know impact this series has, when one of the characters died, the fans even held a funeral for him. That&amp;rsquo;s how big it was there, but unfortunately, Ashita no Joe never really made it to America until recently under the title Champion Joe. But to conclude this review, I will say one thing, REAL MEN WATCH ASHITA NO JOE.

    My Ashita no Joe Review on YouTube: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1JtotcBAwy8<br />
<br />
<br />
First of all I would like to say that I am very glad to make my first Review about my favorite Anime of all time and it could be my last Review too xD. I hope you can find it helpful.<br />
<br />
Before watching Ashita no Joe, I was aware of the fact that it is very old and it must have really Old Classic Art so if you care about the Art more than the Story you probably could find it disturbing. However if you are like me and you mainly care about Story then I guarantee that you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218176">
        would not regret wasting your time in it.<br />
<br />
Ashita no Joe Mainly focus on Yabuki Joe an Orphan who refuse to spend his life in Orphanages so decided to escape in search for his reason to live. One day he found his way to Doya Town which was a poor Town and the Mafia is taking control of it. While Joe was walking the Mafia were abusing some of the poor children in the town but Joe was not intimidated at all and he does not care about making Justice until the Mafia decided to mess with him so he showed them exactly what he is capable of beating them all down showing them the Wild Animal that lives inside of him. Meanwhile Danpei a drunk former Boxer who failed to make it to the top level saw what happened and was impressed of Joe&#039;s Abilities. Therefore, he wanted to see his dream accomplished and he believed Joe is the way to lead him to see a&quot; Bright Tomorrow &quot;. He asked if he wants to be a Boxer and from there the story takes place, what would happen? Will Joe accept Danpei&#039;s offer to lead him to be a Pro Boxer?<br />
<br />
<br />
Story - 10<br />
<br />
I honestly never saw anything like this story in my entire life, the Drama in this Anime reached a level of Maturity and Perfection that I at least did not think it is possible and I did not expect it will touch my heart so deeply. the beauty of it is that there is an important message and the end of Ashita no Joe 2 that touches you and make you realize something you might already know it but they show it to you in their own way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art - 4<br />
<br />
As I said comparing to the Art nowadays, The Art here is bad However it is decent to me I can understand and see what is going on without focusing hard which mainly what I need. Also to be fair I think it was good enough when you compare it to old anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound - 6<br />
<br />
I think the sound is decent you can clearly hear it despite the fact that the anime is old. The openings are really good also you will really love Joe&#039;s Whistle I try to practice doing it sometimes but its hard for me to do it *chuckles*.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character - 9<br />
<br />
I think the characters are great, you will really like them and you feel that every character made his touch on the series. I can not really think of any annoying Character I liked them all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10<br />
<br />
I can not describe the feeling to you exactly but each episode has touched me and made me feel like the series is going to the right way and made me think that I really can not expect anything out of it which was the fun part of the series.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall - 10<br />
<br />
Overall, when you finish it you probably would feel like what I feel right now and you would maybe understand my words and why it is the best anime to me of all time. When you put everything together it just become a perfect Masterpiece.<br />

    If you&#039;re looking for an anime with an excellent rivalry, then it is here where you&#039;ll meet the best boxers in anime.<br />
<br />
Joe Yabuki is a young man from the slums who doesn&#039;t believe in generosity nor trusts anybody. He eventually causes a theft which sends him to juvy, where he is beaten by the boxer Toru Rikkshi. Since then Joe has committed his life to boxing just to settle a score with Rikkishi.<br />
<br />
In his pursuit of rivalry, Joe learns more about himself &amp; begins to believe in kindness along with accepting his new founded life in sports. With the support of his coach, friends &amp;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review139129">
        neighbors, Joe is encouraged to keep winning until he settles his rematch with Rikkishi. <br />
<br />
This anime builds in atmosphere especially with its signature whistle theme that Joe is known for. If there&#039;s any sport anime that can be considered the best this may be it. While the summary sums up part of the story, the rest deals with gritty matches &amp; men&#039;s commitment to their promises. Both Joe &amp; Rikkishi are great characters who even rival the greats of today. While Joe begins as unlikeable he does mature however not everything is obtained easily. Training is the least of Joe&#039;s struggles as he must deal with poverty &amp; the responsibilities of becoming a professional boxer. Similar to Hajime No Ippo, the stories in Joe are quite tragic to the point where it influenced a real life funeral for a certain character. While the tone can be broody at times, it shall leave an impression as you see a wild beast become a man who considers respect, honor &amp; rivalry as important as life itself.<br />

    Ashita no Joe is a show about becoming a better person. Through the mastery of the sport of boxing, Joe rises up from his humble, dirty, ragged, violent beginnings to become more than he is and something truly great. This is the kind of show that is about being better than who you are and transcending where you&#039;re from and all hardship in the way.  Ashita no Joe is a heartrenching, inspiring story that everyone simply must see. The story holds up very well, and is both tightly and carefully paced. Joe begins as a character you don&#039;t even want to like, but you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7523">
        can see somewhere just past all that anger and attitude that he&#039;s a good person. Joe is the kind of character that you really want to believe in, even when he proves you wrong. You never want to give up on him because some part of him never gives up either. The art, though old, is quite beautiful and there are many moments were it freeze-frames that display simple fantastic old-fashioned cel art. As Joe delivers punches, it seems as though its a painting, a work that functions for artistic value as well.  The characters are all fun, enhanced by the art, of course. Not only do they look superb, they are interesting characters - characters that you want to believe in, that seem like real people that you want to see succeed. Also, the OP is amazing and fits the heartbreaking tone of the show. Ashita no Joe is worth every second as its masterful storytelling and beautiful art combine to tell the inspiring story of a total jerk of a street urchin becoming something bigger and better. In the end, Ashita no Joe is not only a show that you must watch, but Joe is the kind of person we should all strive to be.

    Warning! This review contains spoilers, so I recommend that you finish the first season before reading this review. <br />
Plot 9.3/10<br />
Ashita no Joe or known as in other parts of the world as Rocky Joe, Tomorrow Joe, Joe’s Tomorrow, Champion Joe, and Joe is about an orphan who ran away from the orphanage at a very young age who goes by the name Joe Yabuki. After a couple of years when Yabuki Joe is a teenager he meets an old man named Tange Danpei, who used to be a boxer and gets into a fight with Joe and loses. After that at some members of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review219113">
        yakuza show up to fight Joe, but in the end Joe wins. Danpei sees this and asks him if he would like to become a boxer and Joe’s responsese to this is “no “. Danpei still keeps trying until Joe finally accepts the offer, but the only reason why is because of the money. Then a rich woman shows up named Yoko Shiraki and Joe - with the help of the kids they scam her. She finds out about this and Joe gets sent to jail for one year and six months. During his jail time he meets Nishi who becomes a good friend later on and a man that gets into fight with Joe, who defeats Joe. This person is known as Toru Rikishi. After this a rivalry starts between the two of them which causes Joe to become a boxer in order to settle the score with Rikishi. <br />
Review of the plot:   Even though the plot is nothing really special, but the way they handle it makes it one of the best stories I have ever heard/seen. The main theme of this season is pretty much rivalry and the struggles of boxing. In the first season the relationship of Joe and Rikishi evolves to not just being rivals, but becoming closest friends. The struggle this season deals with is losing weight, getting ready to fight Rikishi in the ring, Joe learning boxing techniques, and the pain of killing someone in the ring. The way the handles it is something that left me in tears in how sad this series was becoming and sometimes hard to watch. <br />
Characters 10/10<br />
Joe Yabuki: The main character of the series is an asshole and acts like a wild animal. Due to his past he doesn’t know when his birthday is and who his parents are. Really the only thing he knew form his past is his name. Throughout the series Joe ends up loving boxing, ends up becoming a decent person and respects his rivals. Overall I would say at first Joe is a person that becomes hard to like, but later on he becomes so that you end up loving him to the end of it. It is because of his character development he become my favorite anime main character of all time. <br />
Toru Rikishi: He is Joe’s main rival of the series, a boxing genius, a person with a lot of determination, and also like Joe he is a delinquent. He got sent to jail for nearly killing someone who badmouthed him during one of his matches. Overall Rikishi is a total badass being able to beat up freaking bulls easily. He also is one of the coolest characters of the show. He’s also the person who left the biggest impact in the series and in anime in general. Rikishi is known to be the first character to have ever died in anime. This ended up being very risky for the two creators of Ashita no Joe because killing off a character was never heard of and the fact of killing a popular character could mean the end of the series. In unexpecting terms the fans of Rikishi end up hosting a funeral for him. It is also because of his death the series starts to take a darker tone as you seen with the last 21 episodes of the show and in season 2 of it. In the end Rikishi goes down as one of the greatest rivals ever made and becomes Joe closet friend. <br />
Tange Danpei: Joe’s boxing coach who used to be a boxer, but retired due the fact he can no longer see with his right eye. After he retires he becomes an alcoholic, but when he meets Joe his life starts to change. When Joe got sent to jail he started to write postcard that had boxing lessons such as the jab and uppercut. After that he decide to go over there to further teach more lesson to Joe such Cross Counter, Block, and Footwork. He known to very manipulate by confusing Joe by not train him, but instead training Aoyama instead him in order for Joe to learn how to block and footwork in order to beat Aoyama. His dream is to make Joe a champion since he was unable to do it himself. The best way I can describe Danpei is that he’s a person who’s obsessed with Joe and determinated to make Joe a champion.  <br />
Kanichi “Mammoth” Nishi: Is one of Joe’s closest friends and a person who gets scared easily in the beginning of the series until he decides to become a boxer to overcome his fears. The best way I can describe him is that he is a nice person who has a weight problem, but overcomes this thanks to Joe. <br />
Yoko Shiraki: Toru Rikishi’s manager and her relationship to Joe is the closest we will ever get of a love interest for Joe. In the beginning of the series she is seen as the person who doesn’t care about Joe but later on starts developing feelings for him and cares about him. This is shown when Joe needed a new rival in order to overcome Rikishi’s death.  She also serves a counterpart to Joe to the point it’s hard to doubt if she’s even a villain for the first half of the series. The best way I can describe her is that she’s a very calm person. <br />
Carlos Rivera: Joe’s second rival and the person Joe needed in order to overcome Rikishi’s death. He has a similar backstory to Joe that they were both orphans and both lived in the slums. Carlos is also a playboy who can’t stop hitting on women, a laid back and friendly person. Like Rikishi he also serves the foe Joe has to overcome and becomes really good friends with Joe. He’s also one of Joe most important opponents of Joe’s career since he is ranked 6 in the world.<br />
Wolf: Not much to say except he is the first major opponent of Joe’s boxing career. It is because of the fight they had in the locker why Joe was able to get his boxing license. It is because of this Wolf starts to hate Joe and do anything it takes in order to defeat him. <br />
Overall the characters are the strong point of the series because of how developed they are and how they are handled. I could talk about more characters such as the kids who follow Joe and Noriko, but I couldn’t since they haven’t received enough development and they haven’t really changed that much. <br />
Animation 8.8/10<br />
Due to the fact the show was made in 1970 the animation ends up begin very rough and coming out in a time where anime company was still not used to use colored animation yet. However, there are still moments where the animation does look good and times were it looks bad. It is because of this that it doesn’t really hold up well compared to anime from nowadays. <br />
Music/Voice acting 10/10<br />
The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and fits the series. The main genres they ended up using are jazz and rock. Tracks such as Joe’s whistle, Rikishi’s theme, the opening theme, the instrumental version of the ending. The music really handles up very well and there are some of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in anime. The voice acting, I gotta say was very well handled and each one fits their respective character. I can’t say anything about the Spanish dub, Italy dub, and English dub of it since I can only find a few clips of it and the English dub of it only covers the first eight episodes of it and the first movie. In the Italy dub and Spanish does change the title to Rocky Joe when they aired it. <br />
Adaption 9.4/10<br />
The first season over from the beginning all the way until the end of Joe vs Carlos Rivera, but it does have filler scenes in the series such as the doctor who treated Joe’s wounds and during the time Joe goes on his journey after Rikishi’s death. Even though the series has filler that doesn’t make the quality of it go down. The filler contributes to the story by adding more matches of Joe that the manga did end up skipping. It’s because of these fillers that makes it help making Joe’s boxing career seem more realistic. The filler moments also contribute to the development of Joe for example episode 69. However, the first series skips some scenes such as the moment Carlos kissed Yoko and the exhibition Joe had with Carlos. In my opinion comparing the first anime series to the manga I would have to say the manga is a bit better, but the first season does an amazing job adapting the manga. It also manages to handle things better than the manga such as Rikishi losing weight and Joe’s Journey. <br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
Out of all the series I havee seen they have never given me the same amount of enjoyment I had when I was watching Ashita no Joe. The reason why is because how immersed I was into the story, the characters, the fights, and everything that happened in the series. The fights are the most intense fights I have ever seen. A good example of this is when Joe was fighting Rikishi and you see the moment when both of them start using the “no-guard “position. I was amazed how quickly I started enjoying the series. Within the first 10 minutes of the first episode I was already hooked and I knew this would be a series I could never forget. This also was the first time I have experienced any form of entertainment that left me with a huge impact. This series made me feel like I was being part of the world they live in as an observer and I quickly became attached to the characters to the point I would break into tears the moment anything bad happen to them. <br />
Final Thoughts<br />
Overall this series probably will always stay as my favorite anime of all time because of how amazing it is and the impact it had on me to the point after I had finished the series I ended up going through a void that took me a year to get out of. Overall I give the first season a 9.6/10. Next time I will be working on season 2 and hopefully get that posted on MAL by the end of July. <br />

    WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAIN SPOILERS<br />
<br />
This is considered as one of the best anime ever, and I can say that it&#039;s statement is partially true. What this anime had to offer us? Let&#039;s find out together in this review. I&#039;m gonna make a review for each season of this franchise, so let&#039;s start with the first:<br />
<br />
POSITIVE ASPECTS<br />
<br />
1. Joe Yabuki: By far, one of the best protagonist ever created. We saw him start being a street boy with no interest in anything in particular. Unlike other anime/manga, where once the main sport, power or ability was revealed causing a convenient rewrite of the protagonist so that the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422191">
        story can be given, Joe turned down being a boxer at first, which was much more organic and enriched the story and the character. the transition of him being an street boy to a professional boxer was excellent. After commited a lot of crimes, he was jailed and, then, he found his biggest rival (Rikiishi), which he realized he couldn&#039;t beat with his current fighting knowledge. This is the point where he, finally, decided to be a boxer. <br />
<br />
The story, also, showed happy moments where, for example, he finally felt that he was part of a family (he&#039;s an orphan), and the satisfaction of being acepted by who he is, which was an great message that the anime offered in this particular scenes. <br />
<br />
Also, he is the original and, to this day, the best underdog. He reached the achievements that he made by his own effort, nothing was gifted to him unlike other anime, where, in order to defeat the enemy of the moment, the protagonists recieves power ups outta nowhere in order to beat them. One scene in particular that I really enjoyed about this premise, it was the way that he forced the box federation to enroll the Danpei&#039;s gym inside it. The moment he made the cross-counter against Wolf Kanagushi showed that he could also be resourceful, an attribute that he apparently did not possess and the execution of his plan felt very organic.<br />
<br />
Finally, the writer did a great job showing his downfall after Rikiishi&#039;s death. We saw him in his depressed stage losing a lot of fights for the trauma created, he went to a ilegal fights with no hopes on tomorrow and, then, watching the Carlos Rivera&#039;s showtime (it weren&#039;t fights to be honest), he regained his motivation and it was satisfying see him fight again after this bad moments.<br />
<br />
2.Rikiishi: If Joe Yabuki is the best underdog, Rikiishi is, definitively, the best rival. After stopping Joe from escape to the jail, we saw him, indirectly, encouraging Joe to beat him, where, it a very sutile and organic way, he started to care more about Joe and be better than him. This care got to the point where Rikiishi underwent an inhumane weight cut (which I will talk about later), in order to face and defeat him. The anime showed very well the consequences of this level of obsession that many people, without realizing it, have. After his death, Rikiishi stilled be relevant in the story and in the growth of Joe as a boxer and as a character, which shows the excellent job made with him.<br />
<br />
3. Danpei: He started with a dream to convert Joe in the greatest boxer, however, Joe didn&#039;t have this interest in the beginning. I appreciate how Danpei never gave up on him, knowing the dark past that the old man had. I enjoyed the interactions between him and Joe. It wasn&#039;t like everything that Joe plans to do is law and he just follows the current, the anime showed the conflicts between them, the resolutions and how the friendship between them increased thanks to this. This is a maturity writing level that not many shonen have.<br />
<br />
4. The rest of the cast: I can say that they did a good job with most of them. We know about who are them, their motivations and reason to be in the show (that are different from the Joe&#039;s one), and their grain on sand in the plot and it&#039;s development.<br />
<br />
As you can see, I only talked about the characters, and it was because this anime is about them more than the box. Everybody moved the story with their decisions and not the otherwise, which is something that I&#039;m very thankful with the writer. It was needed more than 30 chapters to see Joe finally having his first proffesional fight, showing the huge work made in the characterization and the narrative flow.<br />
<br />
NEGATIVE ASPECTS<br />
<br />
1. The jail&#039;s arc: In this arc, there was a lot of conveniences involving Yoko. For example, it&#039;s a casuality that Yoko and her grandad were box fans, it&#039;s also a casuality the relationship that she had with Rikiishi in that moment, but, the worst part of this is the fact that Yoko always had to visit the prision where Joe was jailed. It was so necessary that convenience level? Mystery. Without this conveniences, the story would have taken another way.<br />
<br />
2. Rikiishi&#039;s weight cut: Why did the Shiraki gym let Rikiishi to make 2 times this inhuman weight cut? It wasn&#039;t supossed that this is a high level gym and, with this, the protection and security of the boxers are more guaranteed? If we analyze this, all the weight cut part is, in realistic terms, a nonsense. Fortunately, the anime showed the consequences with his death, which saved these mistake from being something worse.<br />
<br />
3. Animation: Yes, I know that we&#039;re talking about the 70&#039;s, so the animation budget was limited during that period, however, it ended being awkward to watch, at least, during the first episodes. The anime improves this aspect with the advance of them.<br />
<br />
4. The ending: It was anticlimactic. I know that this was fixed in the second part, however, talking only about this first part, it didn&#039;t give a good impression after that epic fight against Carlos Rivera. The writer could have shown instead a ending where Joe continues his training to compete in the worlds league and give more hype to the audience.<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION<br />
<br />
It was a great experience watching this anime despite the mistakes that it did. Definitively the best sports anime. And it get&#039;s better in the second part. So, wait for my next reiview where I&#039;m gonna write about it.<br />

    I really wish I could recommend Ashita no Joe anime cause the manga’s story deserves to get a good adaptation and have more people experience it. Unfortunately, both as an adaptation and on it’s own show, AnJ is just bad.<br />
<br />
I initially wanted to approach this from a perspective of someone who hasn’t read the manga and judge the anime on its own strength but I couldn’t make it through beyond about 30 something episodes before dropping it and having a blast reading through the manga. <br />
<br />
There’s two very big reasons behind why I strongly dislike this anime. For one, AnJ has terrible pacing. In 79

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299929">
        episodes it adapts merely about 11 and a half volumes of the manga. That’s roughly 7 episodes per volume. Anyone watching the anime will likely notice the many ways in which Dezaki padded things out. Awkward pauses in dialogue, long scenes consisting of a few still shots, reused animations shown over and over, animation loops that are held for way longer than they should be.<br />
<br />
That stuff is all relatively innocent compared to the second big problem, the way it constantly pads out content with anime original material AND at the same time they manage to cut out some scenes and dialogue from the original. More often then not the stuff they cut is not some unimportant rubble but rather scenes that add nuance to the work as a whole, it removes teeth from a story that bites. I know anime was being produced roughly at the mid point of manga’s publication but they also only adapt about half of it so I don’t believe there’s any excuse to alter so much. Some might say just skip the filler and here’s what makes this even worse. AnJ doesn’t just have filler episodes, some of them are relatively self contained and can be ignored but those are tiny minority. For the most part original material mixes in with canon, at times completely ignoring the way plot unfolds for the sake of filler coming in more smoothly. However hard they try though, there’s always a clear contrast, because whoever wrote the filler didn’t have an ounce of writing talent compared to Asao Takamori. Filler is meandering, pointless, it moves nothing forward and at best reiterates previous material instead of moving forward. It downgrades character to acting like generic archetypes, it dumbs them down by trying to make their cold conclusions seem like the most shocking revelations. I strongly believe that there’s no alteration that had a positive impact and there a fuckload of alterations that build up until a shittastic climax that is Carlos vs Joe arc.<br />
<br />
When you do get to see the canon though, AnJ shows what it could’ve been. A story that still has few analogues in anime, a realistic and sincere story about a dregs of society fighting for a better tomorrow despite their tragic yesterdays. It’s not a drama that makes you feel good, because there’s no escapism to it. It doesn’t round off the edges of the real world, instead slamming you right against those edges and showing you how heartbreaking and hopeless things can be. However it does this not to make you feel depressed but to motivate you to push on forward, to improve yourself, to strive for better things instead of wallowing in the problems or trying to ignore them. Joe and many other characters constantly have to deal with problems, one worse than another and none of them are exactly equipped to handle them. Joe himself is a delinquent like no another. An orphan who constantly moved around and had to defend the only thing he had left, his pride, with his fists. The result of his upbringing is that he’s terrible at normal social interactions. Compromise is not in his dictionary and he lives his life scamming others and spending his nights wherever he can. When Danpei, an ex pro boxer and now pro alcoholic notices him in the slums it’s a starts of a very interesting co-dependent relationship. Joe sees Danpei as an opportunity to get stronger and beat the first opponent he can’t overcome while Danpei sees in Joe an opportunity to get into the world of boxing and climb back up the ladder. While Joe is most definitely the highlight, other characters still get developed into complex human beings with their own personalities, lives, goals and ideas.Unfortunately filler considerably undermines the journey characters go through cause while in the manga every volume is a difficult journey that shapes the characters, in the manga there’s too much a sideways shifts that significantly downplay the arcs people go through. <br />
<br />
Another occasionally strong point of the show is its presentation. One of the biggest advantages anime has over manga, is that you get to hear the characters and you get to see their acting and movement in more detail which in right hands can add a lot of intricacies. Voice actors in particular have to be the highlight of the entire anime in terms of presentation. It’s incredible how much passion comes through in their dialogue, how they manage to capture emotion with such sincerity that I can’t help but feel for them. One thing that always stood out to me is just one scene where the rarest thing happens and Joe actually cries, it feels like he’s genuinely sobbing while trying to hold himself. You get to HEAR that this is a man who’s used to putting up a tough front crying himself after possibly the first moment of genuine happiness in his miserable life. Tange similarly is just fantastic, it’s a travesty that both his and Joe’s VA never participated in voicing any anime other than AnJ.<br />
<br />
Yet, while I will praise voice acting for managing to depict emotional outbursts with rare sincerity, I can’t help but feel that Dezaki’s overly dramatic presentation often hurts the story. When it hits, it’s great, Dezaki has a sense for dramatic flair and it helps the moments that are meant to be exaggerated or shocking but sometimes you need the opposite of that. When seemingly dreadful things happen with little flash, it makes a point. Bad shit can happen anytime, anywhere and to anybody. You’re not special and there’s nothing to say that tomorrow you won’t become just another number in a small box on a piece of paper showing how many people died this year. It’s this kind of quiet dread that and insignificance of the individual in the big picture that can make tragedies all the more depressing and AnJ manga excels at that. When anime exaggerated everything tenfold it makes a common problem seem like a unbelievably cruel twist of fate. Overall it’s part of why anime ends up feeling so cartoonish and immature in the end.<br />
<br />
It’s hard to say how much the flaws I mentioned will impact one’s experience of watching the anime but it’s my honest opinion that as an adaptation it’s a travesty that tramples over excellent while simultaneously only surviving thanks to the strengths of said source material. As its own show I had to drop it due to how damn slow and stilted it is so take that as you will, I only managed to make it through out of morbid curiosity of how bad they’ll screw up the things I love. I know many people managed to genuinely fall in love with this show and maybe if I didn’t read the manga I’d be able to like it more but really hope that anyone who wants to experience this fantastic story choses the manga instead of a lackluster anime.

    Ashita no Joe is a anime that aired in the 1970&#039;s and is arguably one of the founders of sports anime as a whole. But calling this series just a sports anime would not be doing it justice. While yes the story does mainly focus around Joe&#039;s boxing career, intermixed with this is fantastic drama, superb character development, and absolutely gripping suspense.<br />
<br />
The biggest selling point for this series has to be its characters and plot. A lot of shows have tried to make the arrogant asshole lead work but to no avail, but Joe is one of those rare exceptions. Joe&#039;s massive over confidence, seeming

          <span style="display: none;" id="review375869">
        indifference, and his arrogant attitude just seem to work.<br />
<br />
I constantly went between cheering him on as he fought to wanting to reach into the screen and smack some sense into him. Watching Joe grow is a wild ride, but well worth it. And the supporting characters are all well fleshed out too. Every character feels like they fit into the world with real problems, relationships, and goals.<br />
<br />
Ashita no Joe is not a story where the main character experiences nothing but victory. Joe suffers humiliating defeats and struggles with real issues. Because of this there are some parts of the story that are frustrating for the viewer as Joe enters a slump. But at no point is a episode wasted. These bitter defeats Joe suffer make victory all the more sweet and we see Joe develop as a person and a boxer through these slumps.<br />
<br />
The issues this anime suffers from are direct results of its age. While the animation and sound is certainly great for its time period, it just cant compare with modern standards. But while it may not be as smooth as modern anime, once you get used to it you will find the rough gritty art style fits the nature of the anime perfectly.<br />
<br />
One problem I had with the series was the cartoonish design of the seven kids who act as Joe&#039;s entourage, including one little girl, Sachi. When Joe comes back from prison, after at least two years, the kids look exactly the same, not having aged or grown an inch at all. I&#039;m sorry, but young children tend to look noticeably different after two years. I assume this was a conscious choice on the part of the animators, but the rationale for it eludes me.<br />
<br />
Ashita no Joe is a absolute classic with a story as or even more epic than Rocky. If you have even a passing interest in sports anime I urge you to give this show a shot. If you can get past the dated art style you may just find a real gem.<br />
<br />
It really is a shame how tiny attention people give it these days, although I suppose that&#039;s inevitable. Not to sound up myself, but most people tend to only watch series that started in the 00s and after. I hope that more people broaden their horizons and search for some old but gold series.

    Note 1: I am not english speaker<br />
Note 2: This Review will refer to both seasons (Ashita no joe and Ashita no joe 2)<br />
<br />
One thing that i dont like of Sports Anime is that there´s nothing to lose in those series, there&#039;s no tragedy in losing a game, you can always try again and all the characters mistakes dont have great consequences, that´s why i dont like things like hajime no ippo or capitain tsubasa, yes, both series are entertaining, but both feel dry and because of the plot armor i dont care of the characters, because they arent in real danger. <br />
Even those sports anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review211966">
        that are over the average (For example. Ping Pong: The animation), have that plot armor issues.<br />
<br />
With This in mind, let me start the review of ashita no joe...<br />
<br />
Ashita no joe is a very old anime, and because of that the animation is static and the movement is limited and it has elements that have aged badly, but in it´s time it was a very good animation (Considering that this is a 70´s anime), and also the second season (animated by TMS)  the animation had an improvement in their quallity.<br />
<br />
The music is good and kept the tone of the series, but it was quite repetitive and the dirty audio at that time does not help.<br />
<br />
But, Neither the OST and the animated part isn&#039;t what makes ashita no joe an amazing anime, what makes Ashita no joe an amazing anime is something that i said in my introduction, &quot;i dont like sports anime because there´s nothing to lose in those series and the characters are never in danger&quot;, well,  ashita no joe is the exception to that rule...<br />
<br />
Ashita no joe is a boxing anime like hajime no ippo is, but there is a diference, Hajime no ippo treat boxing like Capitain tsubasa treats Soccer Games, in other words, Hajime no ippo treats boxing like Boxing fighting shounen, But Ashita no joe Treats boxing like boxing, with the good parts and the bad parts, and it includes not only Championships and the glory of winning but also deaths and serious injury withdrawls, because of the well balanced tone between the Good parts and bad parts of boxing not only works like a very well done drama, but also as a very valid critique of the 70´s boxing system.<br />
<br />
Also Boxing is used as catalyst to make joe (the main character) evolve from a jerk to a nice person and uses combats to show how much joe has changed after every combat combat. Also i liked rikishi in his role of friendly nemesis and how both evolve before their final Showdown.<br />
<br />
In conclusion ashita no joe is probably the best Sports Anime ever made, even ashita no joe is not perfect and the animatied part have aged badly, but the dramatic elements, character development using boxing as a cathalyst and the absence of plot armor in it´s characters make it ana amazing title and one of the best series i have watched in all my life.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10 &quot;The Japanese Rocky&quot;<br />

    Script - Joe is that type of show that proves quality as timeless. How could it be for a story from the late 60s about a boxer become so important, poignant and meaningful to me in the long term? I have no idea, but I&#039;m pretty sure Ikki Kajiwara knows that well enough to come up with one of the best sports tales ever known and that in my humble opinion wasn&#039;t surpassed ever since, at least not by any anime or manga. But what&#039;s Joe all about? It&#039;s about Joe, your not average underdog who&#039;s searching for meaning and is trained by an old

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262168">
        man that&#039;s also not your average sage coach but rather a flawed drunk one. He&#039;s searching for someone that can fulfill his now late dreams of becoming the world champion and well, that&#039;s pretty much the premise. Now let&#039;s begin training and increasing stakes each episode until the very end? Ehhh, absolutely not. This is not, by far, your average sports shounen full of unrealistic bullshit. Joe&#039;s characters will face a lot of heavy struggles through a lot of time and will learn from them, not forcedly, but slowly accepting certain facts, changing others and always, always and always developing. No action is taken on a whim, no silent moment is random, nothing is out of place, not overall at least. Some changes can seem too of a sudden, but the result is so meaningful that forgives completely the minor flaws. Joe is all about subtlety in each frame of it since simple phrases and glances can convey so much immediately and in the future. Sometimes Joe is the villain, the hero, the victim, the bastard, and at the end, none of them. No matter what you think of Joe, Yoko or Rikiishi, it&#039;s not their full picture or character. They&#039;re three-dimensional and practically real people with real struggles and fears, so harmoniously interlacing with each other, sometimes without a word spoken. A lot of episodes are spent solely in character building and only after we are presented to the actual fighting. There&#039;s also a very special rivalry subtly hiding both Joe and Rikiishi&#039;s desire to face someone they respect. Yoko, a character who represents a sort of intermediator, but that appeared as an antagonist that wasn&#039;t actually an antagonist and whose influence gets more and more present through time. She&#039;s indecisive, kind and polite but also afraid and full of will, it&#039;s awesome to see her gaining such in-depth development since I thought she was going to be forgotten easily. Indeed, most of Joe&#039;s characters have a face of who is going to be forgotten, but they are not. They are people and you will most likely treat them as such. It has one of the most impactful moments I&#039;ve seen in anime and you&#039;ll surely know which one. Also, my favorite episode of anime ever is contained here and the best rivalry, the best protagonist and best couple. See for yourself such a beautiful spectacle of development.<br />
<br />
Cinematography - This show is fucking old school. It may not be so pleasing of looking at, but considering how little it had in terms of production I can&#039;t see it as bad produced. On the contrary, I believe it is beautiful in a way no other anime at the time was. First, the ingenious director Dezaki developed a technique to save costs, the Pastel-Chalked Freeze Frame as TvTropes dictates, and it had some power upon the audience. The best moments ever from Joe are depicted in a high definition stopped image full of impact and surely helped a lot the production team. Limitations sometimes lead to wonderful results in terms of creativity, so I&#039;m happy in seeing Joe being such an amazing show in that matter as well. The character design is original and while the animation is not fluid at all and the repetition is rather common, I can&#039;t deny the impact some monochromatic panels had upon me given the mood in which it was applied.<br />
<br />
Sound - You will remember the whistle, wanting you or not. The opening is beautiful and the soundtrack is decent enough. The major problem, in my opinion, are the voices. While the voice acting isn&#039;t exactly the problem considering when it was recorded, the misplacement is recurrent and more than often irritating. The sound effects are fine.<br />
<br />
1234 - The cops of Joe are more useless than the most average of stormtrooper in existence. You can punch them, kick them, whatever you want, they&#039;ll not react. Kids are annoying af. I know, they become cute and beloved over time, but damn, sometimes it&#039;s just not cool. Since when do kids enter in a fucking prison on a fucking island? Repetitions all over the place, sometimes unnecessary. I would prefer extended moments of silence then filling some episodes with weird misplaced or just repeated actions of side characters. The voices are so misplaced it makes me cringe sometimes, even though I&#039;m surprised they aren&#039;t forced. I mean, Joe&#039;s one is sort of forced but sounds ok and the rest is just fine. If they just had edited well enough it would&#039;ve been way more pleasing to listen to.<br />
<br />
This show is old but gold. Joe is the most lovable asshole out there and you can&#039;t deny it. Talk about nuanced interactions son. If you endure some poor visuals and voice editing, the reward is big enough. Don&#039;t waste your time watching trash, go for it today. It&#039;s a masterpiece for sure. The End.

    The first time I heard of this anime was ,when it was referenced in Bakuman and somehow I was not blessed with seeing this classic until two years after I started watching anime. But damn am I glad I started watching it now.<br />
<br />
This is one of those few shows that I could show to any normal person and they wouldn&#039;t thing I had a screw loose or I was crazy. It far from most staple anime like Eva and Gurren Lagan ,but that&#039;s what makes it in it&#039;s own class.<br />
<br />
The story is better than any blockbuster film or Hollywood TV show I&#039;ve seen in the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309248">
        past decade. The well crafted story of Yabuki Joe fighting yakuza in the street and hustling people for money in the starting arch is brilliant. The portrayal of Joe as the mad dog street brawler to his Robin hood heroics with the slum kids masterfully sculpts the character of the man who is not swayed by words and speaks through his fist.<br />
<br />
Then it gets better Joe completely loses himself he goes from savor of the slums to deranged man in a few days. He is constantly given the chance to apologize and remorse ,but he refuses leaving his pride to be his demise. To avoid serious spoilers I won&#039;t go any deeper ,but I highly recommend this show to anyone who hasn&#039;t watched it.

    **This review is spoiler free**<br />
<br />
Down in the forgotten slums of Tokyo, under the &quot;bridge of tears&quot; by a polluted river, only crossed by those that have fallen to rock bottom - the lost, the broken and hopeless - a small spark leading towards tomorrow is ignited, burning steadily through rain and darkness, a spark filled with endless dreams for the future. Here is the modest Tange boxing gym, filled with second-hand equipment, run by Tange Danpei, an ex-boxer and hopeless alcoholic, along with our protagonist - Joe Yabuki - an aspiring boxer with boundless fighting spirit. <br />
<br />
But the story doesn&#039;t begin with Joe - the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279093">
        aspiring young boxer. <br />
<br />
It starts with Joe - the rebellious and troubled delinquent who has never had a home or known love or family, a boy constantly on the run without any destination in mind, a boy grappling to simply reach a place where he can truly be free. Joe doesn&#039;t start off likeable. He is a swindler, a sarcastic jerk who only knows how to think with his fists, and prioritizes himself above everything else. He fires his mouth off to every authority figure he crosses and constantly tries to upset any sense of order or societal rules. And for a long time he seems like a completely hopeless case. <br />
<br />
Danpei encounters Joe in the slums of Tokyo and almost immediately recognizes his boxing potential. He tries to convince Joe with every ouch of conceivable willpower to try boxing, but to no avail. And this is first thing which sets Ashita no Joe apart from a typical shonen or sports series. <br />
<br />
Joe refuses to box. Over and over again. No matter how hard Danpei tries. No matter what motivational words or random acts of kindness he is shown. He refuses. Joe has his own motivations and rules of freedom which he abides by. He doesn&#039;t simply accept the request of a drunken ex-boxer that he happens to run into because the plot requires it. No - Joe is more than just a character. He truly feels like a living, breathing person. Its almost like Joe doesn&#039;t just rebel against the rules of society. He rebels against his own story and even the author which crafted his existence. His character refuses to bend and yield to the viewers expectations to progress the story, or even what would be the easiest story route for the author. Instead, Joe constantly lives life through his own rhythm and stubbornly lives the way he wants. <br />
<br />
Of course, that stubbornness  and egoism eventually catches up to him. The world isn&#039;t so forgiving as to allow a rebellious teen to do whoever they please forever. And now we reach the second point which sets Ashita no Joe apart - things don&#039;t go smoothly just because Joe is the main character. Sure, he can choose to act like a rebellious asshole, but then he pays the consequences for it. His actions are not forgiven simply because this is his story. So Joe screws up and eventually lands his sorry self in juvie - the place where he meets the man who single-handedly changes the entire course of Joe&#039;s life - Toru Rikishi - a pro boxer. <br />
<br />
Joe&#039;s rivalry with Rikishi (later turned friendship) is what eventually draws Joe towards boxing. The desire to defeat Rikishi lights a fire in his heart that pushes Joe towards beginning a new journey in his life - a journey that ends up completely changing who he is. <br />
<br />
And that&#039;s the thing - Ashita no Joe - translated as &quot;Tomorrow&#039;s Joe&quot; is not a typical sports series about some kid who suddenly decides to be the best boxer in the world. Its simply the story of Joe and the journey he takes - its the story of the best and worst parts of his life, his ups and downs, his regrets and ambitions, and his struggle to find where his &quot;tomorrow&quot; lies. Its not particularly happy, because life was never designed to be happy and easy, but you see Joe find something worth fighting for and them striving towards it with everything he has. <br />
<br />
Throughout this journey, Joe doesn&#039;t remain &quot;a character.&quot; Somewhere along the way, it switches from &quot;the story of a guy named Joe&quot; to almost feeling like you&#039;re witnessing the memories of a long lost friend. You become attached to him, because he feels so real. There were so many times while watching that I would completely loss myself in the moment, and banged my fists on my desk screaming for Joe to just stand up during a fight, &quot;just one more time!&quot; or when I would feel his pain while watching him go through hardship and wish I could sit next to him to give him a pat on the back. There are moments when you want to punch him for being so damn stubborn, and moments when your left wide-eyed and shocked at his endless fighting spirit and tenacity. There are moments when your left feeling a dull, quiet ache in your chest, and moments when you can&#039;t stop yourself from crying.<br />
<br />
And this doesn&#039;t just apply to Joe (although he is the strongest example). All the characters feel realistic, and their interactions are complex. Even characters I originally was sure that I would dislike (the group of kids that always follow Joe around) eventually grew on me. <br />
<br />
Its hard to put all my feeling about this series into words, but for me, this was more than just an anime. It transcended way beyond that. <br />
<br />
I can only describe it as the breathless journey of watching Joe, living his life to fullest, in every moment, with all he has, against all odds and circumstances. His flame rises up and comes to life, igniting everything around him until &quot;all that is left is white ash.&quot; <br />
<br />
In case your still wondering, this is a masterpiece, so just go watch it already. Its worth every second. <br />
<br />
Some small notes: <br />
-The second season was produced about 10 years after the first, so there is dramatically improved art, animation, and even sound. The fights are completely fluid and beautifully animated. The first season also is actually quite well animated with plenty of worth while fights, but it definitely improves later. <br />
-The last 24 episodes of season 1 and the first 12 of season 2 are essentially the same in terms of plot. However, I&#039;m hesitant to say &quot;yeah, just skip the last 24 episodes and move on!&quot; because I feel the last 24 episodes did a better job of fleshing out the relationship between 2 important characters (Carlos and Robert) and explaining their motives, as well as rivalry between Carlos and Joe. However, due to running out of manga chapters, some segments might feel a bit drawn out. Season 2 reanimates everything beautifully and completely new, including increasing the epicness of the Carlos Vs. Joe fight, but at times it felt like it was missing the details I enjoyed during season 1 (such as the Carlos flashback). I think there is value in actually watching everything (both the last 24 episodes of season 1, as well as the reanimated first 12 episodes of season 2) despite there being plot redundancy. <br />
<br />
RATING FOR SEASON 1: <br />
Story:: 10/10<br />
Art and animation: 9/10 (due to some occasional art errors)<br />
Sound: 8/10 (the weakest aspect of season 1)<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
Overall: 10/10 <br />
<br />
RATING FOR SEASON 2: <br />
Story: 10/10 (with a flawless ending episode)<br />
Art and animation: 10/10 (dramatically improved from season 1)<br />
Sound: 10/10 (dramatically improved)<br />
Characters: 10/10 (the strongest aspect of both season 1 &amp; 2)<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
Overall: 10/10 - an unforgettable experience

    Ashita no Joe - The First Shonen Anime and the Best!<br />
<br />
Ashita no Joe is an anime that I added to my &quot;Plan to Watch&quot; list for some time, maybe two or three years. The story follows the young Joe Yabuki, a troublemaker from the Japanese suburbs. Joe has a natural talent for fighting, but he always gets in confusion, steals, and mind. Things change when Joe meets Danpei Tange, a former boxer who had to end his career after losing sight in one eye. From there, Danpei tries to straighten out Joe&#039;s life through boxing training.<br />
<br />
Ashita no Joe was released in the early seventies after

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271369">
        much other shounen anime in the 50&#039;s and 60&#039;s. But I would say that Ashita no Joe was the first anime that revolutionized the style, introducing all the features of a modern shounen.<br />
<br />
The graphics are certainly not the most precise although I like it very much even though this is due to the time the anime was released. In addition, this scarcity of bright colors and good animation technology give the anime an ambiance very conducive to what it represents: post-war Japan.<br />
<br />
Like any modern shounen style anime, Ashita no Joe surprises us with the humble roots of the protagonist, a rebel wall with a strong personality that will act-surpasses within the world of the professional boxing. The feeling of competition is incomparable. The comedy and the drama play innocently in this anime that is already mentioned as a classic but unfortunately unknown by many.<br />
<br />
Anyone who sees this anime will immediately recognize the origins of a style that gave rise to DragonBall, Saint Seiya, Bleach, Naruto but mostly Hajime no Ippo and Rurouni Kenshin, among others. But there is a warning: the protagonist Joe has a charisma that leaves all the others in the mud.<br />
<br />
Story: 9 | Art: 9 | Sound: 8 | Character: 9 | Enjoyment: 8<br />
Score: 9/10

     How can I describe in words the very high qualities of this work of art, a classic of Japanese culture that until today, is a symbol of references and inspirations of its archetypes. The anime, Ashita no Joe, has a great quality in its characters, especially the main one, which starts out as a damn annoying youngster to a young man that you will definitely love for the rest of the play, not only in Joe (main) but in his other main ones too, having their development and charisma only lifted over time. Ashita no Joe also shows her technical side with regard to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311926">
        her sport, boxing, only in a shallow but consistent and fun way all the time, presenting us with lively and masculine fights with different climates and tensions, a different way of showing how destructive and exhausting this area of ​​boxing is, together with its characters and their due convictions, who are reduced to dust to maintain their glory and love for what they do and love to do until the end, but with tragic consequences in the end. And also, we have the characteristics of the production, even being from 1970, are of decent quality and consistent with the atmosphere of history.<br />
It is also worth highlighting their soundtracks that mark much the work, be the opening, or the OST of a character that just to hear it, you already know who it is.<br />
<br />
In short, this anime is a masterpiece of the sport / drama genre, and that everyone admired of the genre or casual onlookers looking for new experiences should see or read in life. Final note 10/10.

    I&#039;ll open this review by saying that I sincerely respect this work for what it brought to the whole anime scene, given its age. But. BUT.<br />
Respect for an anime that defined the whole genre can only take you so far. Yes, this show is very old, yes you have to give it props for what it brought to the table, but at the end of the day, you&#039;re watching this with your current eyes, and your experience with anime. You&#039;re not watching this like a 70&#039;s kid would.<br />
To me, how people consider this anime is like how a Literature Teacher try to sell their 1700&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review379928">
        books to their students, with the trump card in their hand : &quot;It&#039;s a classic !&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashita no Joe is indeed a classic. If we were in 1972, I&#039;d tell all my friends about this, advising them to watch it. But we&#039;re not in 1972 anymore. We live in the present.<br />
There are far better shows to watch out there, even in the boxing sub-genre.<br />
The Story and the two main characters are by far the strongest parts of the anime. Joe and his coach are given a very extensive backstory for how they became who they are, which is thoroughly enjoyable. But when it comes to the rest of the cast... the child crew is annoying at best, insufferable at worst. The little girl only has 2 character traits (while the other are just NPCs that likes Joe) : she is a micro-tsundere, and she throws her shoes at whoever is doing something mildly annoying to her. But the real fallen is Nishi. The dude did a 180 in terms of attitude in the span of 3 episodes.<br />
<br />
Art and sound wise, I mean, the show is from 1970. There&#039;s nothing to expect. The only props I can give them is that it&#039;s pretty consistent throughout the show.<br />
<br />
I&#039;mma come back real quick on the characters. While the show is relatively coherent, there are a few moments that had me tilting my head to the side.<br />
First : The show takes place in a crooked slum in 1970 Japan. Did the police simply didn&#039;t care about outlaws ? Or was the penal system completely out of its mind ? With what Joe did, he should have had MUCH worse than what he got.<br />
Second : Every. Single. Person. Cares. About. Joe. The dude is a rebellious cringe teenager, and even the policemen he beat up come back to cheer him on. No. If there is one thing many people around the world are guilty of, it&#039;s holding on to grudges.<br />
Third : How in the searing pits of hell does Joe survives his matches ? It&#039;s especially true in the match against Wolf. Joe has one of the thickest plot armor I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m going off the trails, but I just want to point out that given the score AnJ got on MAL, many people are scoring it without today&#039;s standard in mind. And I believe it to be missleading to any anime fan that can come across this work of art. Reviewers are confusing respect and objectivity.<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, I like this show, and i&#039;m going to finish it. It&#039;s just not as good as people makes it out to be, especially regarding what the industry can offer right now.<br />
In conclusion : If you like Sports Animes with interesting story and a MC that has a backbone, you&#039;re in for a treat.

    Joe is a classic boxing anime that started in spring 1970. It was made by Mushi Productions and directed by Osamu Dezaki. The show follows Yabuki Joe&#039;s road from a juvenile delinquent kid, all the way to becoming a pro boxer. Joe is a rude and quick tempered guy who is quick to get into fights. Joe packs a serious punch though, and this catches the eye of ex-boxer Tange Denpei who wants Joe to become a boxer. But because of Joe&#039;s troublesome nature he gets sent to juvie. There he meets boxer Rikiishi Tooru, who becomes Joe&#039;s rival. <br />
<br />
I had high hopes going into

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251963">
        this show. I had heard a lot of good things about it, so I was hoping for an enjoyable ride, and boy did I get that. Ashita no Joe is one of the very best sports anime I&#039;ve ever watched. It might not look the best, but it still managed to hook me. I got seriously invested and hyped about the fights that happened, even though they barely even moved. And watching Joe change from that immature little delinquent who would start fights with anyone, into a more mature guy and a professional boxer was quite the ride. I can not sing this shows praises high enough without also going into spoilers. The only thing I can say is, this show is fantastic and you should definitely check it out. It might be old, but it&#039;s still gold.

    For fair warning, this review may contain some spoilers. I happened to have already done a review for this series, but I didn&#039;t like the way that I reviewed it before so I&#039;m doing it again. This is a review for both seasons of Ashita no Joe. I first found out about Ashita no Joe when I was browsing through recommended videos on YouTube. There was a video that showed a clip of the last big fight of the series. It spoiled the ending for me, but it got me interested in the series nonetheless. The thing that appealed to me about the series the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343461">
        most was the art style. The art style for the show is pretty old due to part 1 being made in the 1970s and part 2 being made in the 1980s. The story as a whole was enjoyable to me. It follows the story of a teenage wanderer named Joe Yabuki, who travels from town to town in Japan looking for food and shelter. He eventually stumbles across a poor town where he meets a former boxing coach named Tange Danpei. Tange Danpei takes a strong interest in Joe upon meeting him because of his wild nature as a street fighter. He then goes through a series of attempts to persuade Joe into letting him train him to be a professional boxer. Joe eventually accepts his offer, but only for the purpose of swindling food and shelter out of him. He also swindles money out of a respected and wealthy young woman who helps the town. This leads to him going to jail, and eventually being sent to a special juvenile prison. In prison, he finds his motivation to box when he crosses fists with a former professional boxer. In order to get the strength needs to take on this boxer in a professional ring, Joe decides to accept Tange Danpei&#039;s offer to train as a professional boxer. Joe eventually gets released from prison and begins his journey to becoming a professional boxer.<br />
<br />
The thing that I loved most about Ashita no Joe was Joe&#039;s development as a person throughout the series. Joe starts off in the beginning as a young man with no home, no ambitions, and no trust for others. He&#039;s someone who resists kind offers from people since he views most people as self-serving. He&#039;s a teen whose only concerns are finding food and shelter and maintaining his freedom as a wanderer. However, that all changes when Joe meets a professional boxer in jail by the name of Rikiishi Toru. Rikiishi is a young boxer who is very similar to Joe in his personality. Rikiishi is a more mature than Joe, but they both like to express there thoughts through their fists rather than words. Rikiishi became the first person Joe wanted to fight in a professional boxing ring because Rikiishi outclasses Joe in skill and experience as a fighter. He&#039;s the first person who ever outmatched Joe in fighting skills. Joe&#039;s departure from prison sets the stage for Joe&#039;s growth not only as a fighter, but as a person. Through each of the boxing match that Joe faces, Joe becomes mature in his resolve to fight as a boxer. In the beginning of his career, Joe only sees boxing as a sport for fun. However, as he meets boxers of different backgrounds and motivations, Joe realizes that boxing isn&#039;t simply a sport where two people duke it out for personal enjoyment. He realizes that boxers actually put their lives and well-being on the line just for the opportunity to be crowned the world&#039;s champion. This changes Joe&#039;s resolve from fighting for personal pleasure to fighting for those who have risked their lives and careers fighting to the top of the world&#039;s boxing ranks. <br />
<br />
Another thing I like about the show is its soundtrack and its art. While the art for Ashita no Joe is pretty old, it doesn&#039;t stop you from getting engaged in the fights. It may not be at Hajime no Ippo&#039;s level of animation, but it&#039;s still satisfying. I actually feel that its art quality and animation are actually appropriate for the tone of the show. The show focuses less on flashy animation and more on the human qualities of the characters. The soundtrack in Ashita no Joe is good because it conveys the mood of the characters and the story itself. If you&#039;re looking for a sports or action anime with a moving story, enjoyable characters, and wonderful character development, I highly recommend this series.
