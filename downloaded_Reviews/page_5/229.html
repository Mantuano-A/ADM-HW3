    What we have here is an expression of love for art. It’s a treat in every sense of the phrase, being sweet to the taste beyond expectation and a dietary rarity worth your appreciation and indulgence. As time goes on, television ad rates plummet, and production committees get stingier and stingier with their limited funding and man power, impossibly ambitious original anime become more and more financially harrowing to fund and logistically nightmarish to create. Yet somehow, here we have it, the beauty to behold: Great Pretender.<br />
<br />
How much of what I’m about to tell you which you find completely obvious is entirely dependent on how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356656">
        blind, deaf, and senseless you happen to be, because if you ask even such a staunch critic as myself, this is the hardest masterwork to overlook and the single most broadly appealing triumph of entertainment I can name. From the drop dead gorgeous artwork and animation to the surprisingly thoughtful, endlessly amusing storyline, and from the delightful cast of lifelike characters overflowing with charisma to the fantastic music which itself is just as charming and built with just as much personality as any one of the characters, every facet of the show is delivered with expert craftsmanship awarding its audaciously dedicated production values. Given just how expressive, experimental, and downright weird the roots of anime are, most of the standouts which you can find therein are just as esoteric, and Great Pretender stands to be an exception the likes of little before. Inspired by Western crime dramedies which it swiftly outclassed in a single debut episode of exceptionally clever episodic structuring and excellent visual direction, Great Pretender follows amateur swindler, Makoto Edamura, as he gets swept away by the real deal, a gang of con men with whom he exploits others and entertains himself all whilst reaping the seeds of trickery they’ve all sown together…which is what I meant by “broadly appealing.” Yes, I conveniently left out the show’s thought provoking themes, all its discussions and ideals on social injustice justifying an individual’s turn to crime, but my basic summary of the plot is no lie, and it is such a cliche setup as to be almost embarrassing, so the fact I can even get close to calling it the masterpiece which I nearly have already speaks to the brilliance of all involved in its peerless creation. Great Pretender is solid proof a simple concept can write its way to a classic. It’s exploding with life, love, and lavishness in every way it can, and anyone unable to appreciate the monumental effort and unrivaled talent necessary to deliver on such a beauty or empathize with the unflinchingly human psychological core behind all its scheming and hilarity is simply beyond my comprehension, or somehow just contrarian enough to deny it all. <br />
<br />
If I had to oversimplify it, what makes Great Pretender so good in a single phrase is the tact with which each episode is handled and the way in which they are uniquely cared for by whichever member of the directorial staff headed its careful creation. Despite being an arc structured show which does not hesitate to grab you with low-stakes, hardly annoying cliffhangers, the true method to the narrative’s madness is every single episode feeling like an open and shut case nailing the finish and leaving you as gratified as you are dying for more, whether you be left hanging on the cathartic conclusion to a resonant character development, the satisfying resolution to an episodic or overarching plot point, or simply on the butt of an actual joke, landing yet another delightful punch line driving home the show’s damn funny comedic identity just a little more. Unlike most anime and, quite frankly, most entertainment in general, Great Pretender is self-aware regarding all its metatextual eccentricities and in-universe contrivances, so no matter how hysterically outrageous nor matter how artistically bold the story goes about presenting itself, it will always be tongue in cheek enough to come across as jest as opposed to being an irksome logical conundrum, and while not every episode is as perfectly balanced as the last, the show as a whole certainly is. Most anime which aren’t made for TV find themselves with the privilege to be as uncensored as they’d like, and by extension, they often end up leaning too hard on their freedom to finally incorporate vulgarity and nudity to their heart’s content, but Great Pretender stands as a complete and total exception. Accompanying its boisterous comedy and sensational personality is an incessant sense of realism offered by—yes, those brands of obscenity—but also by its deftly paced character time and nuanced characterization sewn throughout the hijinks. Comparable only to the best of Shinichiro Watanabe’s works from Cowboy Bebop to Space☆Dandy, Great Pretender has mastered the art of endearing and repulsing the audience with its duplicitous adult cast, the push and pull which invests viewers in the among the most human yet still the most entertaining on-screen individuals one can find in the most natural way one can find them. <br />
<br />
What makes building a character such a delicate science is you want to make them worthy of the screen by having their actions be somewhat absurd enough to be entertaining, but you also want to keep their passions down-to-earth enough to be emotionally engaging as relatable human beings, and this is where Shinichiro Watanabe truly excels. No one just throws on episode one of Samurai Champloo immediately invested in characters as ostensibly ridiculous as Mugen, Jin, or even the comparatively normal Fū, but given how well-written and smartly characterized these misfits are over the course of the show—the show which itself makes a point to show them at their lowest, most vulnerable points in life and at their happiest, most unapologetically free spirited—even the most jaded among viewers will finish the journey completely immersed in their stories, assuming, of course, they weren’t cynical enough to drop the show before then. Great Pretender is not only a master of the exact same craft, but one which has just as handily mastered the accompanying craft of outstanding voice acting. Complementing the prepossessingly sharp character designs of industry legend, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, every character is deftly brought to life by a cast of talented actors and actresses who’s voices embody their respective characters to a tee. As Makoto and his compatriots march along the vibrant parade which the animation staff has made their lives, skeletons start falling out of closets just as you’d expect them to from the secret histories of real people, and the characters subtly progress in intimacy as they overcome problems of life and love alike. Be it Laurent, the mastermind fueling every fire under everyone’s asses; Abby, the blunt, stoic braun serving as the honest counterbalance to Laurent’s conniving brains; or Cynthia, the absolutely badass, electric heroine who you’ll be wanting as a best friend for life or desiring as a wife by the end of the show depending on your sexual preferences; every single one of the colorful personalities on screen has just as much to learn and love behind their beautiful faces as does the cover of the show itself. And speaking of having a colorful personality, Great Pretender is one hell of a feast for the eyes!<br />
<br />
Great Pretender, visually, is straight fucking unbelievable. While you may get this impression immediately, credit to Takeda Yūsuke’s ever legendary background art, all facets of this anime prove themselves to be crafted to the perfection of a Production IG classic back from the days of the Kamiyama Team who shared the same art director. Be it the explosive yet expertly balanced coloration and its astoundingly consistent shading, the flawless character artwork and the intricately detailed linework required by those razor sharp designs, or the flowingly lavish animation elegantly weaving it all together, every frame of Great Pretender is laudable to some degree even at its very lowest points and worthy of a standing ovation at its mountainous heights. Everything is overflowing with personality and branded with an unforgettable artistic identity such that I can promise with complete confidence you’ve never seen anything quite like it at such a high production value, and I promise just as easily you’ll never see anything like it again outside the purview of Production IG. This is the first project handled by WIT Studio with the exception of their debut series with Mitsuhisa Ishikawa’s full involvement, and his intimacy with this endeavor is no secret given the amount of IG names inscribed on this gem. With Takeda Yūsuke having already been mentioned, Kyouji Asano, the now legendary graduate of Team Oshii and Animation Director for Psycho-Pass and the first two seasons of Attack on Titan, has made his return along with too many animators to count, and Ishikawa also seems to’ve organized the recruitment of the best of the best not already under the illustrious IG umbrella. From the criminally obscure genius color designer behind works such as Space☆Dandy and Redline, Yūko Kobari, to the industry veteran sound director who’s so prolific and who’s been around for so long that he worked with Chiaki Konaka in bringing to life the brilliant soundscapes of Serial Experiments Lain and The Big O, Shouji Hata, Great Pretender is stacked with more talent than you could ever imagine, and somehow, every little bit of it shows. Great Pretender is the first time WIT Studio has fully lived up to both the technical perfection and unflinching consistency of their founders at Production IG, and it never ceased to take my breath away.<br />
<br />
The introductory paragraph of this review is worded in such a way to mirror the first anime review I ever read, which I’d directly quote if not for having unfortunately forgotten the address of whatever blog I saw it on. I only remember the impression its wordage left on me. Sentimental, I know. It was a review for an anime equally ambitious and equally outstanding as Great Pretender which shocked as many critics as fans it elated. It was a work also made at the dawn of a new decade, relatively speaking, and much like this decade, it was a time in which anime as a whole was on a downturn. Studio Madhouse had just thrown out Masao Maruyama in the face of their ambition fueled bankruptcy, and now, a decade later, their only remaining holdout of talent is Director Natsume, who’s work is the only excuse optimists have left to not call the studio dead. Gainax had been exposed for their toxic business environment which drove away Hideaki Anno only to then lose its remaining creative leads, who now, nine years later, are thriving in their own limelight at studio Trigger whilst proudly carrying the creative torch of the Gainax of old before it all went sour. More positively speaking, Kyoto Animation was redefining the word “polished” and winning award after award for their work on genres most powerhouse studios would scoff at, yet now, nine years later, a fifth of their staff was horrifically massacred in an inhuman arson which has gone down in history as the second most deadly mass killing on Japanese soil since the end of the Second World War. So much has changed since that review was posted, so much, except the studio which pioneered the anime it was reviewing. That’s right, the studio was Production IG, and the anime was Psycho-Pass. The reviewer offered his thanks to the pantheon of artistic prowess and creative genius which had, in such an incredible fashion and with such an epic production, restored their hope in an industry they saw as stagnating, and now it’s my turn to do the same. The son has grown into the shoes of the father, as WIT Studio has finally, unequivocally matched their founders at Production IG, and with their achievement, my own hope in the anime industry has been restored just as those of the cynics before me. <br />

    Story: 7<br />
I&#039;m gonna go ahead and say that the story isn&#039;t very good, it&#039;s at best slightly-better-than-average, and at worst predictable. In the first 5 episodes we get around 3 major twists. and they weren&#039;t well done. Almost all of the 3 twists can be &quot;predicted&quot; with a little more than 3 braincells. The story also does seem convenient at times, and some of the ways that our &#039;lovable&#039; main character Edamura gets out of trouble is fucking stupid. As for the time skip between the 5th and 6th episodes, I think it&#039;s pretty well executed, normally I hate the idea of a time skip,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343377">
        because character development can happen between then and it feels like the show&#039;s introducing a new character. However, this is not the case for this anime, as Edamura didn&#039;t change much except that he now wants to live an honest life, which makes sense after he&#039;s conned over 10 million USD. If anything can redeem this story, it&#039;s the fact that the show establishes that it has a lot of twists early on in the story , and personally I had a fun time trying to guess what twists are going to come later, because even though you can &quot;predict&quot; the twists, the actual twists are never exactly like your prediction.<br />
Art: 10<br />
Absolutely fantastic. The creativity of the styles and direction are absolutely fantastic, and keeps you entertained. I personally enjoyed how they used the exaggerated bright colors to depict Los Angeles, and used more toned down colors when depicting the past.<br />
Sound: 10<br />
I don&#039;t know what to say about this one. The ED stood out to me because they used the actual song sang by Freddie Mercury.<br />
Character: 8<br />
The characters in this anime are solid. Nothing they do come off as strange or out-of-character. The interactions and relationships between the characters are also very fun to watch. However, the developments for the character seem a bit fast and even rushed at times. At the end, Edamura seems to be care for Abby and Laurent despite having no reason to do so except sympathy.<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
I had quite a fun time watching this anime, and I am looking forward to the next few episodes.<br />
Overall: 9<br />
I highly recommend this anime to anyone who just wants to watch a fun story. If you are one of those people that try to critically analyze every scene of the anime and is not a fan of twists, I suggest you watch the first 3 episodes, if it doesn&#039;t catch your eye by then, I suggest dropping it.<br />

    Great Pretender was exceptionally disappointing. What I thought to be watching was a modern Lupin, it ended becoming the classic &#039;predictable but not fun&#039; kind of story. I wanted to like it and say originals aren&#039;t always bad... I couldn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Nothing in this godforsaken anime makes sense. Every &#039;plan&#039; is meant to show that our main cast is good at this, but everyone besides them are plain stupid so of course they&#039;re gonna succeed without breaking a sweat, or are they? Well, we&#039;re meant to believe that they&#039;re trying really hard but the &#039;challenges&#039; are never found. All of the outcomes are painfully predictable and you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356670">
        can see who is who and/or what she or he is up to based on their personalities alone. The supposedly villains are just there, often times without any reason and in the end they lose, as you would guess. What you don&#039;t know is that all of this feels underserved. You don&#039;t cheer for the main cast nor get to either love or hate the villains. You only feel empty. Like an emotionless humanoid who wanders in search of happiness. That empty.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, some of the characters are so smart that often times distort reality. &quot;Predicting the prediction one character has predicted once his prediction was predicted&quot; is the whole anime in a nutshell. When these guys start doing something you know they&#039;ll win, as aforementioned, undeservedly. Nothing can go wrong with them around and I don&#039;t like how their &quot;everyday life&quot; is portrayed. You see them walk all over and yet, after everything they&#039;ve done, they still live. How&#039;s that possible? Because it isn&#039;t. The &#039;Great Pretender&#039; world is modern and considering the whole thing is full of cameras (and more) I don&#039;t see any reason why the gang hasn&#039;t been killed yet or at the very least put in prison. Is this anime really expecting me to believe that despite all of that they keep outsmarting everyone? Because if that&#039;s intended to I don&#039;t buy it for a second. It&#039;s humanly impossible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great Pretender&quot; has a bad cast, a poorly written story with a immeasurable predictable results and even its ending song (which is best thing this anime has to offer) couldn&#039;t save it. If you want to hear my advice, stay away from this. Just my two cents.

    I have never felt so compelled to write a review about an anime until I watched the end of Great Pretender. <br />
<br />
To sum it up, I loved this show until the last arc. I genuinely thought that it would go down as one of my favorites of all time. The art is fantastic--every scene looks like it could be a convincing computer wallpaper, the animation is super fluid, the music and sound design is exceptional. And, until that last arc, the character development and plot seemed just as good. I felt attached to the main cast, invested in their backstories and growth as they worked

          <span style="display: none;" id="review359894">
        together in elaborate con jobs. The dialogue and pacing was great as well--it struck a delicate balance between funny moments and handling serious topics very well. There seemed to be strong foundations for a fantastic ending to this show.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s what I thought, at least, until I actually watched that last arc.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think there&#039;s really a way to address the problems I have with Great Pretender unless I spoil some things, simply because I truly thought it was amazing up until that last arc. So, if you still are interested in watching it and don&#039;t want to read on, a spoiler-free analysis of the show would be that it almost felt like the first 3 arcs and the last arc were from 2 completely different shows. In the last arc characters acted in complete opposite ways as they were built up, plotlines weren&#039;t fully developed and, at times, did not seem to make coherent sense, pacing was extremely rushed, and all of the accomplishments and character growth established in the plot of the first 3 arcs seemed to be erased--especially in the last episode. <br />
So, I would recommend to just watch the first 14 episodes, because they&#039;re really fantastic. If you do feel some compulsion to continue watching after that (and, if you really like the show, you probably will, since episode 14 doesn&#039;t really offer a satisfying conclusion), I would say go ahead, but just keep in mind that you&#039;re setting yourself up for disappointment and confusion.<br />
<br />
SPOILER REVIEW BEGINS HERE:<br />
<br />
I&#039;m going to review the easily most consistently good parts of the show first--briefly, since I don&#039;t really think there&#039;s much to say other than that they&#039;re really good.<br />
<br />
ART: 10/10<br />
<br />
EASY 10. As I said before, every shot looks like it could be screencapped and used as a photo or computer wallpaper. Animation is very clean, character designs are polished, and the color pallete is bright and creative. I am in love with the art style and direction, as both were inventive and made the anime really stand out.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 9/10<br />
<br />
I think all of it was great in terms of music--there was a variety of different music styles and variations of the theme that I loved to here recur throughout the show. The ED is fantastic because of course, it&#039;s Freddie Mercury, and the OP is really fun and poppy big band, which fits the show perfectly. The only thing I took issue with was the fact that there were often many different languages being spoken in a scene, and it wasn&#039;t clear what language people were speaking at times. This was mostly due to the fact that Japanese was established as being the substitute for English in the first episode to make it easier for VAs to actually voice act instead of speaking a foreign language. That distinction began to get muddled when scenarios started happening in Japan, where it became unclear as to who was speaking English vs Japanese since they all audibly were speaking Japanese in the show. It even got more unclear when one of the main characters actually started speaking English audibly, but the rest of the cast continued to speak Japanese while calling it English...it sounds confusing because it is. Overall though, it didn&#039;t really interfere with the story, except for in that last arc...but there are definitely bigger problems with that last arc than just weird translations.<br />
<br />
And now, for the parts that I feel extremely conflicted about--STORY and CHARACTER. I&#039;m addressing them both at the same time because I feel like it would be impossible to address one without having discussed the other.<br />
<br />
STORY and CHARACTER...I have no idea what to rate them. N/A?<br />
<br />
I genuinely cannot decide on a number to give the STORY and CHARACTER sections of this show. If I were just discussing the first 3 arcs, my ranking would probably fall within the 9-10 range--again, I really believe it was great. I think the only arguable detriment of that first arc would be the &quot;predictability&quot; of the cons. I personally don&#039;t believe that the twists were super predictable, moreso that the predicability came from audience always knew the outcome was always going to be in favor of the main characters, or else it wouldn&#039;t feel satisfying. I don&#039;t think that&#039;s necessarily a bad thing though--many shows thrive in the fact that you always know plots will resolve in a satisfying way. The interesting thing about Great Pretender&#039;s first 3 cases was not how the case would end, but how the con was handled, and how the plot would change one of the main characters and increase our knowledge of and empathy for them.<br />
<br />
Speaking of characters, all were likable and relatable in the first 3 cases. We got to see the backstories and growth from 3 out of the 4 main characters--Edamura, Abbie, and Cynthia. Each of the cases focused on something from their past that drew them to becoming conmen, and how that history related to the con at hand in the current case. Personally, I liked the first case (Edamura&#039;s case) the best just because the novelty of the main cast and certain twists in the case, such as Abbie and Laurent &quot;dying&quot; and Cynthia being a conwoman the whole time, were well-executed (however the initial shock of these &quot;deaths&quot; and reveals for the audience is what made them great...boy, it would be a shame to have the writers recycle these plot details again in the last arc...). Each character&#039;s traits and personalities are also explored well through the con--Edamura is kind-hearted and honest who is always kept in the dark about details of the con (acting as a lens for the audience to view the plot through), Abbie is rebellious and, to put it simply, a badass, and Cythia is the flirty, quick-witted and quick-tempered woman of the team (she reminded me a lot of Faye from Cowboy Bebop in ways). The only main character who isn&#039;t explored is Laurent, the smooth-talking classic conman who recruits Edamura and acts as the de-facto leader of the group. He&#039;s still good enough of a character to be likable while also remaining mysterious through these first 3 cases, which says a good deal about the talent of the writers up until episode 15. <br />
<br />
Basically, I think the characters and story were pretty solid for the first three cases. I could go on about certain plot details, but what drove me to write this review was my feeling about episodes 15-23 (aka the last arc/case), so let&#039;s just get right into that.<br />
<br />
The last case focuses on Laurent&#039;s past, which is certainly not a bad thing--his backstory is actually pretty interesting, and I thought the way they tied Laurent&#039;s connection to Edamura&#039;s dad was handled pretty well. I also think episode 15-middle of episode 18 isn&#039;t horrendous--Edamura is shown to have compassion for the kids that are being trafficked, and the narrative is showing the toll that being an undercover member of the trafficking company is having on his mental health. He begins smoking in every scene, and, when it comes down to it, forces the kids out of their imprisonment at gunpoint, this scene being harsh but necessary to expand the audience&#039;s perspective that Edamura spending a significant amount of time with bad people is wearing down on him, even though his intentions may be good. Judging by these actions, it seems like the plot is going in a direction of focusing on freeing those kids and absolutely destroying Suzaku (the human trafficking organization)...because human trafficking is WRONG. And anyone who participates in it is NOT GOOD. THAT IS THE PRECEDENT THEY ARE SETTING UP FOR THIS ARC. And, given what we know about Edamura so far and his actions in the past arcs, he seems to have a strong moral compass and will often do the right thing even in the face of adversity, even if it&#039;s rash or not completely thought-out. It&#039;s what makes you root for him, and the way others adapt to these actions during a con is what makes you root for them.<br />
<br />
However, things take a turn in the middle of episode 18 that sets the precedent for the rest of the show to plummet into confusion and inconsistency. The part I&#039;m specifically talking about is when Edamura&#039;s father appears to have ratted out Edamura, Abbie, and Cynthia to the Shanghai and Suzaku trading companies while they attempted to free the imprisoned trafficked children, and Edamura, Abbie, and Cynthia are all facing seemingly certain death, as they&#039;ve been taken to a boat and are being held at gunpoint over open water. Before this point, there are some minor red flags that have happened, mainly concerning Edamura&#039;s father. In the span of about 1 episode, the audience&#039;s perspective of him has flipped from being on the human trafficking side, to him conning the human trafficking side, to him conning Edamura and ultimately working with the trafficking side. It is a lot of side-flipping, which makes it kind of confusing for the audience, but not inherently self-destructive in terms of guiding the show&#039;s plot. Another thing to mention is that the leader of the Suzaku company is portrayed as a stern and vicious old woman who has a soft spot for Edamura. This last aspect has not influenced Edamura&#039;s actions so far because, like all of the audience, he understands that she is a BAD PERSON. Because she literally buys and sells children. So there should be NO SYMPATHY for her. <br />
<br />
What changes everything is when Edamura&#039;s father tells Edamura to kill Abbie and Cynthia to gain the respect of the Suzaku lady. When Edamura refuses, he &quot;kills&quot; them himself, which is a big no-no, because there are really only 2 options that this action creates for the audience to believe. The first option is that Cynthia and Abbie really have just died, which feels anticlimactic and disappointing, and, given that there are about 5 episodes left and so much work has been invested into their characters, probably not likely. The second, more believable (and yet somehow worse for the plot) option is that Cynthia and Abbie aren&#039;t really dead, and that Edamura&#039;s dad is actually working with THEM, not the trading companies (so...4 side flips within a single episode, at this point). This also feels unearned and does not bode well for the rest of the story because 1. they already used the &quot;OMG someone just died!&quot; trick during the first case, and 2. because of the frequent side-flipping, the audience starts to lose trust in the identities that have been established for characters.<br />
<br />
It only gets worse from here, though.<br />
<br />
The part that seals the deal (at least narratively for me, and seemingly for the rest of the case, given how everything proceeds from this point) is that as soon as Cynthia and Abbie &quot;die,&quot; the narrative immediately begins to push this idea that the Suzaku lady (who SELLS CHILDREN) is kind and compassionate. She takes pity on Edamura seconds after the people who she was most likely going to kill were just &quot;killed&quot; by giving Edamura the freedom to decide what he wanted to do with his father, giving him a gun and expressing her sympathy. Everything can still be fixed, though. At this point, the authors could still make it believable that Edamura&#039;s father truly is a scumbag who just killed his friends, or they could go the other route (as they did) and make it turn out that he&#039;s part of the con, and actually on Edamura&#039;s side. All they really had to do was just make sure they represent that Edamura is still exhibiting his traits of compassion and kindheartedness by NOT KILLING HIS DAD, despite everything his dad seems to have done. It&#039;s a little cliche, but it would allow the writers to show that, despite everything that Edamura has gone through, he will still make the morally right decision. This is something that has been accentuated in EVERY. SINGLE. CASE.<br />
<br />
And yet, they decide to have him just shoot his father in the chest. Which, of course, the audience is less likely to believe, because now we just got 3 sudden main character deaths, and we have the knowledge that they can fake dying.<br />
<br />
I think this choice was to accentuate the fact that being in the human trafficking business has taken such a large toll on Edamura, but I think the cost of doing this definitely outweighs the benefits in terms of creating an interesting story. For one, Edamura genuinely believes he is killing his dad in that scene. I don&#039;t care if that&#039;s just a ruse and his dad is actually fine (which is exactly what happens)--the sentiment behind that action cannot be taken back. If you&#039;re going to make such a dramatic move like that, there should be no room for lighthearted reconciliation between Edamura and his dad when everything&#039;s said and done (which is exactly what happens). <br />
<br />
What I also don&#039;t get is the real motive behind Edamura&#039;s dad&#039;s actions. He lies to his own son on the boat, &quot;kills&quot; Edamura&#039;s friends right in front of him (potentially causing trauma for his own son), and for what? Dorothy? While again I&#039;ll say I don&#039;t really have a problem with the Dorothy-Laurent backstory, I think it doesn&#039;t make sense that all the characters, which have been shown to be generally pretty reasonable, would go through so much to essentially just mess with Edamura while getting some kind of revenge for Dorothy. Seriously, why even bring Edamura into it at all if you genuinely want revenge for your dead friend, and why even go through all the trouble to deceive him and incite a possibly permanently broken relationship with your child?  This is addressed a little in the end of the show when Edamura is yelling at his dad with the Suzaku katana to his dad&#039;s chest (which, by the way, ends in Edamura getting killed...but not really, because, you know, faking your death is a great plot point when you use it 5 times in a row, right?) but the ending seems to show that they were working in kahoots the entire time...so was that even a real argument? The back-and-forth shifting of what &quot;side&quot; Edamura&#039;s really on and who he&#039;s fighting against from episode 18 onward, undermines all of the character development that was established for him before and makes the narrative feel like it&#039;s aiming to be confusing for the sake of being confusing.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s more frustrating is that the focus of human trafficking being bad is essentially thrown out the window after the &quot;deaths&quot; of Edamura&#039;s dad, Abbie, and Cynthia in episode 18. Edamura decides to throw out his conscience and LEGIT work for the Suzaku human trafficking business (which BUYS AND SELLS CHILDREN) because the Suzaku lady seems nice, and it&#039;s heavily implied he reminds her of her estranged son, and she reminds him of his mom...which is so messed up for so many reasons. I get that they&#039;re trying to humanize the villain, but this humanization is addressed so sloppily after setting this precedent that human trafficking is BAD and anyone who participates in it freely is a BAD PERSON (which is absolutely correct!). This, again, completely subverts the audience&#039;s belief that one of the sole aspects of the Edamura&#039;s character is that he&#039;s compassionate and kindhearted and the fact that he serves as a moral rock for the rest of the conman crew. And yet, the narrative still seems to want you to sympathize with him and the Suzaku lady. Which, not gonna lie, kind of feels like they&#039;re asking you to sympathize with human traffickers. I think a good story is capable of making you feel sympathy for anyone (take the Sopranos--the whole show is about making you feel sympathy for a mob boss that commits crimes and ruins lives on a daily basis), but completely changing the ideals of a main character to be sympathetic towards the head of a human trafficking company within the span a of a few episodes, after CLEARLY ESTABLISHING that this company is the ABSOLUTE WORST...that ain&#039;t it, chief. That ain&#039;t right.<br />
<br />
Another thing to mention is that, when they introduced the Dorothy-Laurent plotline, they essentially shifted audience&#039;s perspective of the goal of the conmen from being noble (destroying a terrible company that BUYS AND SELLS CHILDREN) to being vengeful (getting revenge for Dorothy). That second goal wouldn&#039;t be so bad if it didn&#039;t completely overshadow the first, seeming to prioritize the importance of revenge over fighting against human trafficking. The children and the plotline the writers started about them feeling like they&#039;ll &quot;never be wanted&quot; is completely forgotten as soon as that Dorothy plotline is introduced--the fate of the children is thrown in as an afterthought in the final minutes of the show. The main conflict at the end of the con isn&#039;t about fighting THE BUYING AND SELLING OF ACTUAL CHILDREN--it&#039;s about being mad about a friend dying because wow I can&#039;t believe someone died while trying to infiltrate a company that BUYS AND SELLS CHILDREN AND HAS NO MORALS. The worst part about this is that it&#039;s revealed that Dorothy isn&#039;t even dead--she just lost her memories and is just chillin&#039; with an old couple on the beach--which means that the &quot;revenge&quot; plotline holds less weight than it even did before. No, actually, scratch that--the worst part about this is that all they do to get &quot;revenge&quot; (and fight human trafficking, I guess) is put the leaders and a few of the members of the Shanghai and Suzaku trading companies on an island and let them just vibe there. Like BRO you&#039;re not even going to get them arrested?! They are either going to die on the island OR they&#039;re going to make it back to the mainland, the second option being more likely given that at least one of them probably has a phone and will be able to call for help at some point. Regardless of whether or not they make it back from the island alive, it&#039;s guaranteed that BOTH of those trafficking companies will be fine, unless they are so inept that they can&#039;t figure out a new leader and are so crippled by the financial sacrifice that both companies seemed pretty okay with making in that deal that was supposed to take place in the final episodes. I think the show doesn&#039;t make it clear enough that the company is &quot;ruined,&quot; unlike the other cases, where each villain was shown to have lost everything due to the conmen by either getting thrown in jail, losing all their money, or a mix of both.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the outcomes of the villains from the last cases...the icing on the salt-filled cake that is the last case of Great Pretender is that it appears that all the people who were established as TERRIBLE people from the previous cases are in on the con. Edamura appears to just happen to have the contacts of all three of the antagonists from the last 3 cases, and he has them help him with the con for reasons that I believe are not fully explained. And these actual criminals, one who one of the main characters (Cynthia) has had a personal vendetta against for about 20 YEARS, are just chilling on the boat, explaining to the audience how they regained their status and were totally content. The main characters don&#039;t even seem perturbed by these villains being involved with the con--the most surprising non-reaction is from Cynthia, who I would assume would be livid about someone who took advantage of her and her ex-partner&#039;s lives for his own benefit just chilling and gambling on a yacht like nothing happened. This particular development seemed to just erase both the goals of the conmen, which were to bring down bad people (which they clearly failed at or didn&#039;t care about, given that the three antagonists they had supposedly &quot;brought&quot; down seemed perfectly happy and content with their lives) and all of the deplorable acts that these antagonists were shown to have engaged in in the previous cases.<br />
<br />
In other words, it felt like the show almost betrayed everything that it said it stood for, in terms of dealing with serious topics and actual crime. Judging by the rest of the reviews I&#039;ve seen submitted here for this show, I think some other people feel similarly to me about this.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s not to say that all of the parts of this case were completely nonsensical and bad, however. If I am to say anything positive story-wise about case 4, I really thought Abbie was solid the whole way through, even though she had very little screentime. And, except for the last part where she just seems totally okay with that painter fraud guy just chilling on the yacht, I think Cynthia was fine as well--she provided some comic relief when her and the rest of the conmen gang were painting the fake Suzaku building...which I&#039;m not even going to get into how stupid and convoluted that whole idea was, given that I&#039;ve been writing this for approximately 2 hours straight and my exhaustion with just writing simple sentences is probably showing at this point.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT (...no number again)<br />
<br />
Once again, I don&#039;t really know how to rank this section either. I thoroughly enjoyed the first 3 cases, I was utterly baffled and disappointed by the last case. I don&#039;t know how any of that would translate to a comprehensive score of enjoyment without being completely biased towards my feelings towards either the first three cases or the last case. I will say once again that it really does feel like cases 1-3 were from a completely different show with completely different characters than case 4, so I don&#039;t feel like it&#039;s appropriate to group them into one score.<br />
<br />
OVERALL CONCLUSION (TLDR) (4/10)<br />
<br />
4/10 doesn&#039;t feel like it&#039;s a low OR high enough score when addressing this show. There are so many aspects that I absolutely adored from the first 3 cases that were just obliterated in the last few episodes from a few odd narrative choices that completely subverted the tone and our understanding of key characters. I am astonished by how plotlines were started and then just immediately thrown out and characters were just changed on a whim for shock value, and am just kind of awash in disappointment right now, as I really thought this show was going to go down as one of my favorite anime.<br />
<br />
It feels like the last case of Great Pretender was the big reveal of a giant con that ran through the entire show. The first 3 cases served as the deception that Great Pretender was truly going to be (and end) fantastically, with a solid cast of likable characters, a good sense of humor and dialogue, and a coherent plot that would make you wish you could just erase your memory and watch the show again for the first time. And that last case served to show all of us that, like any great con, things that you thought were undeniably true could easily be undermined. If someone were to tell me that I would be ranting about how much I was disappointed and infuriated by the the ending of Great Pretender about a month ago, when I was excitedly waiting for Case 4 to drop after bingeing all 3 of the cases within a few days, I would&#039;ve laughed. I just wouldn&#039;t have expected a show that seemed to exhibit such sensitivity for establishing solid characters and understandable plots to completely throw everything out the window within the last few episodes of a show...and yet, here I am, ignoring the real-life work I should&#039;ve done 2 hours ago, instead spending my time typing furiously at my keyboard, writing an overly long review that I&#039;ll be lucky if one person actually reads through, feeling like I&#039;ve just been duped.<br />

    We will, we will mislead you.<br />
<br />
There are many confident men in this world. Some people act for money. If they did a mistake once, they lose everything. It serves them right. Because they&#039;re villains. Well, an exception exists. They bring out excellent skills in some cases and keep surviving like pros. The group name is unknown but we can know their existence. &quot;GREAT PRETENDER&quot;.<br />
<br />
In Los Angeles, Makoto Edamura&#039;s trouble begins continuously. He is this show&#039;s MC and his nickname is Edamame. He is known as a very famous confident man in Japan. However, his luck didn&#039;t continue forever. One day, Edamura was cheated out of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356714">
        his money by a certain person. He was forced to go to America. The main story starts from here. Edamura would be caught up in lots of cases. At first, I love Edamura&#039;s personality so much. He is very clever, sensitive, and clumsy in a good way. His English locution is really funny. In other words, a strong accent. Edamura isn&#039;t a perfect human. His past is very cruel and sad. He became a confident man helplessly. His true dream is the opposite of something like that. More bright and hopeful, you know. He cherishes his family and friends at the same time. Especially his family is the biggest existence for him. Edamura is not evil. His life is thought-provoking and profound. You never know when our lives may come to the end. Actually, Edamura is struggling for his destiny so hard. You may misunderstand his first impression but wrong. Edamura is purely human. Following the above, I can respect him. He knows money is not everything. You can understand his identity by watching this show. He only thinks of his important people. Let&#039;s talk about Edamura&#039;s advantages more. He is a good talker because he is a confident man. So he can fool and steal someone&#039;s things. This point is involved in the main story deeply. He seems silly during every episode but different. He cheats some enemies with his own brain, and eventually, he gets the upper hand. That&#039;s why he continues to do his job very well.<br />
<br />
Not only Edamura but there are many smart characters in this show. Laurent, Abigail, Cynthia. They&#039;re also main characters. You can expect their character development. It&#039;s amazing. Abigail is a hot-tempered, grumpy, militant woman. She has a fatal bond with Laurent. Her past is so hard more than Edamura. I won&#039;t spoil her details but she is very delicate in terms of human feelings. Her special skill is Air Race. In a word, badass. Abigail knows how to win in betting. Almost the opponent loses to her. It can also be said gunfights. She is the strongest gunslinger. About Cynthia, she is quite a sexy and comprehensive woman. Cynthia has a lit sweetheart but their relationship is complex. Nevertheless, they keep a good relationship. Her fascinating looking and speaking would confuse every enemy. Don&#039;t underestimate her true power. She is understandable with her companions at the same time. How cute. Laurent is the most mysterious guy. His information is all riddle. But he is basically a good man. He already sees through Edamura&#039;s potential before the meeting. He is a genius. You should be seen relationships like Edamura and Laurent in many works: buddies theme. However, this show&#039;s case is wrong. Two relationships are just setting. Not including important elements. But you can expect their funny and interesting dialogues. Of course, this is not something limited to them. This show is full of surprises. Every case is really enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Wit Studio&#039;s visuals won&#039;t be disappointed you. They&#039;ve been doing a good job like Attack on Titan. Great Pretender is no exception, too. Very colorful, detailed, well-made. Especially OP animation with jazz. Reminds me of Baccano! and Cowboy Bebop strongly. Their work never betrays us. I praise their world-level hard work. I wanna appreciate them. Music and voice acting are also eargasm. ED song is brilliant. Freddie Mercury is known as Queen&#039;s vocalist. I was surprised staff members used The Great Pretender. Awesome. Every episode won&#039;t get bored us. Because the main writer is Ryouta Kosawa same as Confidence Man JP (Japanese TV program name). If I was to describe this show&#039;s slogan, Confidence Man USA. I&#039;m a big fan of Hiro Kaburagi (this show&#039;s director). His 91 Days (previous work) job was truly wonderful for me. Great Pretender can be the spiritual successor of 91 Days. Both have genes.<br />
<br />
Great Pretender is literally a GREAT show. Many exciting scenes, well-written characters, mature style. This show is definitely targeted at older people or adult audiences. Not your typical crime thriller at all. I love this show from my heart. I recommend this PRETENDER gem to you. I hope you will surely love it. This show deserves more attention. AOTY as Original category for me.

    This show is FUCKING FANTASTIC so far!<br />
WIT Studio did not come to play!<br />
<br />
The story is captivating and flows very well. It is also fast-paced and unpredictable! The tv and movie references are great as well. I loved that they mentioned Walter White from Breaking Bad, cause that was definitely what I was thinking of at that part of the story XD. (9/10)<br />
<br />
The art is very colorful and fun to look at, the animation is also very fluid and clean. It looks like arcs are going to take place in different countries and cities, so I&#039;m excited to see future landscapes as well! The landscapes and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343610">
        backgrounds for Los Angeles were great! (9/10)<br />
<br />
The ost is very jazzy and I&#039;m digging it. I feel like it fits the story and tone well. I absolutely love the opening and ending as well. (8/10)<br />
<br />
The characters are very fun, the great chemistry between characters is already apparent too. We&#039;ve only gotten a bit of Edamura&#039;s backstory so far, and it was a really good, sad, and relatable. (8/10)<br />
<br />
Obviously I&#039;m in love with this so far, so enjoyment is a (10/10)!<br />
<br />
Overall, I rate it a (9/10)!<br />
Don&#039;t let the current score steer you away from watching it! It seems to have received a lot of 1s by people who haven&#039;t even seen it!

Generic Crime Drama: The Anime.<br />
<br />
By that point anyone with a passing interest in the industry matters should be aware that Netflix is a cancer that kills anime, so I’m not gonna talk about that. The fact that The Great Pretender is a western TV show that only superficially looks like anime is of no consequence, the problem that it isn’t even a good western TV show.<br />
Every story beat seems to be ripped off from The Sopranos, Breaking Bad and every other “morally complex villain protagonist does crime” show ever, but the quality of presentation is severely lacking compared to those. There are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343321">
        too many things that feel thrown in just to be there, without any thought put into making them count for anything. Like a background character can suddenly get the spotlight and have half an episode telling his tragic backstory - only to become forever irrelevant immediately after. So what was the point of that?<br />
What really made me drop the show was contrived poorly-written developments that exist to advance the plot while not making any sense. I’m going to explain that with examples, so this is where the spoilers start:<br />
<br />
1) Here’s the very first scene of the show: an obvious crook tries to scam an old lady, the MC swoops in to save her and gets rewarded. Of course, the MC and the crook were actually in cahoots, that&#039;s how their whole scam works. Then stuff happens, and then we get a twist that reveals that the old lady was a plant and she was actually in cahoots with the crook to entrap the MC. Here’s the thing: the crook and the old lady work together - and the first scene has happened inside a house where the MC or anyone else couldn’t see them - which means they would just chill and drink tea for half an hour instead of playing out the whole “scam” for the audience. The show expects you to be a moron and gawk at the series of twists, instead of actually thinking about what you see, which isn’t good writing.<br />
<br />
2) An FBI team busts up a drug deal at the moment the money exchanges hands - and the reason their timing is perfect is because they have an informant (the MC). So, the criminals are on the floor, hands behind their back… and the chief of the operation walks up to the informant for the sole purpose of announcing to the criminals that this guy is an informant, which is pure cretinism. See, the point of it is that Character A snaps and tries to shoot the MC, gets riddled with bullets along with Character B who tries to shield them because he loves them, I guess, and the MC can feel bad about the whole thing. Not only the setup is pure cretinism, the outcome is also nonsensical because neither the love of Characters A and B was ever made relevant for the audience before that, nor the MC has any reasons give a fuck about those two beyond the blood splatters ruining his suit. There are actually even more twists after that, but I don’t care. You can only put in so many twists per minute before the entire show becomes a parody of the entire “plot twist” concept.<br />
<br />
Tl;dr: bad show is bad. Don’t watch it.<br />

    Great pretender is the latest anime from Wit Studio, creators of shingeki no kyojin and vinland saga. This anime is very different from their previous seres but it looks very good, at least what they have shown until now.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10<br />
The story is pretty straightforward, but its very funny. You will probably know how they will trick the victims, but that doesn&#039;t mean that it isn&#039;t well executed and hilarious, in its own way<br />
Art 9/10<br />
The art looks amazing. The use of different color palets and vivid colors to represent the scenery, and their characters looks wonderful and makes you want to continue watching just to see

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343723">
        the breathtaking art.<br />
Sound 9/10<br />
The soundtrack is another of its strong points. The ending and the opening are top notch. The ending is sang by Freddie Mercury so this gives the ending more points<br />
Character 8/10<br />
The main characters are funny and reletable, and i&#039;m sure that in future episodes we will see some interesting development from them.<br />
Enjoyment 8/10<br />
I&#039;m having a blast with this series and i&#039;m looking forward to the next episodes <br />
Overall 8/10<br />
So far what they have shown looks promising and it seems that it will get better in future episodes, so if you are thinking if you should give it a try, i will say yes.

    Some animes I feel like I have to write a review for it, this is one of those animes due to its ridiculously overrated score.<br />
This is one of those &quot;artistic&quot; anime, with hipster art, hipster soundtrack, bad/generic story and boring characters.<br />
<br />
It is one of those things the industry releases every now and then to get wannabe &quot;critics&quot; to give high scores and praises because of its predictability(put some 80s jazz soundtrack, generic holywood story and cheap-but-fluid art).<br />
<br />
Art is subjective, but I wont bash on it. Ill give it a straight 7/10.<br />
<br />
sound ill go with mediocre because of how generic, 5/10.<br />
<br />
character? enjoyment? story? there is none,

    Great Pretender has a decent soundtrack, and the art is quite pleasing, but these things don&#039;t matter when the story is poor. The emotional/dramatic scenes were well done, but I couldn&#039;t take it seriously knowing how absurd the plot was. If you don&#039;t get too hung up on how well the plot is written, you might enjoy it, but it was dreadful for me.<br />
<br />
Great Pretender is about a journey of international swindlers conning people that they deem evil. But the ones that are being conned aren&#039;t the &quot;evil&quot; individuals, but YOU, the viewer. The scriptwriters are trying to con you into thinking that there weren&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review374259">
        any enormous plot holes and that the show was good. <br />
<br />
Great Pretender wasn&#039;t able to fool me, so that&#039;s why I&#039;ll be exposing this deceitful scriptwriting to protect others from this scheme.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t want to read the whole thing, I&#039;d recommend reading section 2, which objectively states the plot holes, or section 4, which points out how nonhuman the characters are in a subjective manner.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: The sections below contain vulgar language at times.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
---------------------------------Spoiler Ahead---------------------------------------<br />
<br />
1)<br />
The problems start in the first episode. Laurent manages to lure Edamura to LA with his huge brain. Then Laurent visits Cassano with Edamura. When Laurent feeds the fake drug to Edamura with no prior explanation, Edamura freaks out and runs away like a maniac. If Edamura hadn&#039;t reacted like a maniac or tried to vomit it in a calm manner, Laurent&#039;s plan would&#039;ve failed. So the only explanation is Laurent was able to calculate Edamura&#039;s exact reaction, which is ridiculous. You&#039;re bound to run out of luck when you leave things to chances. <br />
<br />
2)<br />
Then comes the second arc. Even the premise of the second arc has plot holes. Ibrahim is fixing air races on his show, so that his brother Clark can always come first. Ibrahim is so determined to fix races that he was willing to sabotage Lewis&#039;s plane, which led to Lewis becoming crippled. My question is, why? Are people going to stop watching your air show the minute the current champion loses a single race? You can make Clark win ten matches again right after. I think the main reason the writers created this plot hole was to make sure Ibrahim was an &quot;evil&quot; person. Ibrahim is an evil person, so I&#039;m going to definitely root for the other criminals that are trying to steal money from him. <br />
<br />
The way Ibrahim trusted Edamura didn&#039;t make much sense. I understand that Laurent used his colossal brain to portray Edamura as a similar person to Ibrahim and make Ibrahim have an affinity toward Edamura, but that is still not a good reason to trust Edamura. <br />
<br />
Also, if the races are fixed, experienced pilots watching the show should be able to tell that certain people are throwing on purpose. With the power of the internet, it shouldn&#039;t take long to expose such a scheme. Yet, people are oblivious. So oblivious in fact, that it isn&#039;t odd for people to gamble on it. If this weren&#039;t the case, Ibrahim would&#039;ve thought the idea of gambling was ridiculous when he was introduced to the secret gambling society. Another problem is that Ibrahim could&#039;ve found another way to gamble on fixed races long before our swindlers came into the picture. Yet, he didn&#039;t and was adamant at using the one that got introduced to him. This problem can be somewhat explained, but it still ends up being a bit of a stretch. When Ibrahim gets banned from the gambling place for faking his identity, he wants to gamble again. That&#039;s why Edamura says that they will accept him again since he has a lot of money, which doesn&#039;t make any sense. As the owner of the air race, you would think any decent gambling place would bar you from gambling on races that take place on your show. After being persuaded by such shitty reasoning, Ibrahim does go back to the gambling society. <br />
<br />
They convinced Clark— a pilot skilled enough to compete with veterans— that Edamura had the hand of god or some shit like that. Edamura made adjustments to Clark&#039;s plane, and Clark took the plane for a ride. Clark&#039;s time didn&#039;t improve at all, but then came the fake journalists. The journalists said that even spectators such as themselves could tell that his plane had gotten faster. That&#039;s all it took for Clark and Ibrahim to be convinced that Edamura&#039;s skills were the real thing. Can a skilled person like Clark can&#039;t tell the bullshit that he&#039;s being fed? Of course he can&#039;t because the characters in this show can&#039;t think if the plot doesn&#039;t deem it appropriate.<br />
<br />
By the way, what was up with how our swindlers sabotaged the plane? They messed with the engine while people were there. No one heard the sound of the fuel cap, or the chemical being thrown inside the fuel cap? To be fair, you can just say it&#039;s an anime and ignore this one.<br />
<br />
3)<br />
I think the third arc was the best one out of the four. My criticisms are minor for this one. When Edamura got hungry and looked at the fridge, he saw a toffee box. He took the toffee box because he was hungry. Cynthia then took away the toffee box from Edamura and ordered pizza. The toffee box had the ring Thomas drew. This interaction later made Edamura look for the box due to curiosity. My question is, why was a special memento like that inside the fridge? Couldn&#039;t the writers find a better way to interject Edamura into Cynthia&#039;s personal relationship? I guess you can argue that Cynthia did it on purpose to tell Edamura, or Laurent was responsible, but both of those arguments feel hollow. There was an emotional scene where Cynthia threw the toffee box into the ocean, but I couldn&#039;t take it seriously, knowing that even the interactions regarding the box were a stretch.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the turning part in this arc was when Coleman badmouthed Fara. Abigail asks whether Fara will buy the painting for Coleman, and Coleman addresses Fara quite demeaningly. I find that quite ridiculous. Coleman has been hanging out with Fara for a while, and she&#039;s buying paintings worth millions of pounds for Coleman, and Coleman is going to talk shit about her to a girl he&#039;s known for a couple of days? Coleman isn&#039;t a decent person, but you wouldn&#039;t do such a thing out of safety. Abigail records Coleman&#039;s remarks, and our swindlers manage to convince Fara to abandon Coleman. So our swindlers very much got lucky here. But what if Coleman hadn&#039;t talked shit? These criminals were planning to take 70 million pounds from Fara, who was being manipulated by Coleman. Our swindlers, as righteous as they might act, are a bunch of assholes, and I&#039;ll elaborate on that by explaining the mess that is the fourth arc.<br />
<br />
4)<br />
I thought the fourth arc would be the turning point for the show because it started quite well with no visible plot holes. I was ready to give Great Pretender a 5 and move on with my life. Yet, it ended up being so frustrating that I ended up writing this review no one asked for.<br />
The viewers learn that the whole show was part of a grand scheme. Laurent planned to steal money from Liu for years after the girl he loved, Dorothy, was &quot;killed&quot; by Liu. Liu ordered Dorothy to be shot because she slapped Liu prior, got caught for being a swindler, and told Liu to die. I would argue it was well deserved. Laurent is devastated and tells Oz, Edamura&#039;s Father, to come up with a plan to steal money from Liu. The script already sounds quite stupid, but it gets worse when we look at how Laurent and Oz achieve their goal.<br />
<br />
They make Edamura join a Japanese company without telling him the company engages in child trafficking. The story doesn&#039;t explain how they managed to lure Edamura into the company, but who cares at this point. Edamura gets in contact with Laurent, and Laurent tells him that they will con the company. Fast forward, Edamura gets in contact with his father and still feels very affectionate towards him even though Oz ran away from his family after getting arrested years ago. Why did Oz even become a swindler in the first place? He was a lawyer; didn&#039;t he make enough money? Oz makes up garbage excuses to Edamura regarding neglecting his family. The problem with this scene is that we can&#039;t tell the writers&#039; intentions. Are the excuses intentionally bad because Oz is making excuses, or were the excuses supposed to make sense like the rest of the show did? Edamura tells Oz that they are going to escape and that he should join them. Oz then tells this plan to the Japanese crime syndicate, and everyone gets caught. They get brought to a boat. Oz even points a gun at Edamura to stop him from attacking him, and later tells him to shoot Cynthia and Abigail to show his loyalty. After Edamura refuses, Oz shoots Cynthia and Abigail. Then the head of the Japanese crime syndicate tells him to shoot his father, and Edamura gets forced to shoot his father even though he still cared a lot about him a day ago. As a result, Edamura gets fucked mentally. Who wouldn&#039;t after witnessing your love interest and friend getting shot, and shooting your father. He doesn&#039;t eat anything for three days, and becomes an active smoker. Here comes the banger— none of the characters are dead. This is Great Pretender, no one in this show can possibly die. Laurent and Oz planned it out, so they had the blood bags and everything ready apparently. Laurent&#039;s reasoning for not telling Edamura is because he was too honest to keep this plan under the wraps. You can&#039;t trick me Laurent. The reason you didn&#039;t tell us is that it would&#039;ve been boring to watch otherwise, and you&#039;re just trying to fuck with the viewer. For what cause are they ruining Edamura&#039;s mental health? They&#039;re messing with this kid to one-up a crime syndicate, jesus christ. How childish can Laurent and Oz be? Does Oz not give a fuck about his son at all? There was no good reason to mess with him in the first place, but they didn&#039;t bother to tell him that they were alive either? What is going to change after they succeed? They didn&#039;t even make money since they spent the money to swindle the syndicates. You would think that more people will catch onto how absurd this is since the viewer unconsciously empathizes with the main character. Apparently it&#039;s not obvious because the show has a score of 8.41 on MAL. <br />
<br />
They even executed their plan with the help of people they swindled in the past. Cassano helped them out in the end. You would normally expect the people you tricked would have a grudge against you and betray you. Not in Great Pretender. The characters can&#039;t think unless the plot deems it appropriate. Even if they did, I&#039;m sure Laurent&#039;s huge brain would detect it and create another plan. You can see Cassano, Coleman, and Ibrahim all hanging out and having fun. Even after losing money to our swindlers, it seems they are still quite wealthy. It just shows how irrelevant the actions of our swindlers are. Irrelevant as they might be, they didn&#039;t stop short at ruining a kid&#039;s mental health for it. Even Dorothy is alive. She got shot, got lost in the ocean, and didn&#039;t die. Of course she can&#039;t die. It&#039;s the Great Pretender after all. She conveniently has Amnesia. Otherwise, the story wouldn&#039;t have happened in the first place. I don&#039;t get these types of happy endings. They feel very forced.<br />

-Closing Statement-<br />
<br />
I&#039;m writing this review almost a week after watching it. I can make this many points because the show was filled with absurdities. I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve forgotten many things, but there were too many absurdities that I ended up recalling quite a lot. If you asked ten people to watch the show and list the plot holes, I think the lists would be quite distinct since there are so many. I still can go on, but I think I&#039;ve made my point.

<br />
art-colorful (Wit Studio crew visited the cities to add reality on thier art.)<br />
<br />
sound-really good.<br />
<br />
character-funny (I need to know thier backstory, but we&#039;ll see thier development.)<br />
<br />

    Man, in all of my years watching anime, I&#039;ve never watched such a good show that left me with such a bad taste in my mouth. Before I get into the meat and potatoes of my review, let me first say that I will try to avoid spoilers for those of you who aren&#039;t watching the sub online off of Netflix, since the final arc isn&#039;t available on US Netflix yet. Furthermore, a lot of my harsher scores in the story, character, and enjoyment areas are heavily influenced by the final arc, and especially the ending, so if you don&#039;t want to be jaded before

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357116">
        the final arc officially releases, just stop reading here.<br />
<br />
Story: 4<br />
The story follows the exploits of Makoto &quot;Edamame&quot; Edamura, a two-bit scam artist who took advantage of old people in Japan until he meets Laurent, the first person to con him. After joining up with Laurent, an enigmatic and charismatic confidence man, Edamura gets roped into several schemes all targeting wealthy criminals who have used their influence to avoid justice. The series takes  a mostly light-heated and fun approach to each of these cons, although there are moments of genuine emotion sprinkled throughout that help make the cast a lot more likeable and relatable. Furthermore, there are enough twists with each of the cons to keep them exciting, though some of them do require a good deal of suspension of disbelief. This fun story manages to stay consistent for 14 out of the 23 episodes before taking a sharp turn in the final arc. In order to avoid spoilers, I&#039;m not going to talk much about this final arc, but basically the plot becomes silly at best despite the grim subject matter -- international child sex trafficking -- and the resolution feels like a slap in the face given how the story had played out up until that point. One of the interesting ideas of the show is that Makoto is one of, if not the only good person in Laurent&#039;s crew, and he essentially acts as the heart of the group comprised of manipulative narcissists. Because of his earnesty, Makoto ends up being taken advantage of constantly in Laurent&#039;s schemes, often finding himself completely in the dark about what&#039;s going on until the final minutes. The final arc deconstructs this aspect of Makoto in a really interesting way as well, essentially exploring the hypocrisy of Laurent&#039;s group and how their actions might actually push Makoto far enough to turn on them. However, in a massive cop out that I will not reveal, this whole character arc gets completely uprooted, leading to an unsatisfying conclusion that completely ignores the previous 3 arcs and just feels hollow. On one hand, I understand why the show did this, given that one of its core themes, especially in the final arc, is forgiveness. In every previous arc, one or more of the characters learned either to forgive themselves or one of the people they were scamming, so it makes sense that this theme continues in the final arc. Hell, you could even try and call the ending a subversion of expectations given how it really does subvert the viewers expectations; however, subversion for subversion&#039;s sake isn&#039;t inherently good, the payoff has to be satisfying, and it just isn&#039;t here. Furthermore, the way that this theme is explored in the final arc with Makoto just isn&#039;t satisfactory and honestly felt very contrived. There&#039;s honestly no reason for Makoto to forgive these people, especially considering what they put him through, and yet he does anyway. Maybe this speaks to my own poor character more than poor writing on the part of the show, but still, there are still examples of undue forgiveness past this moment in the finale that are even more contrived and a lot harder to rationalize for me. Finally, there&#039;s the post credit scene at the end of the final episode, which I don&#039;t even want to think about and I honestly can&#039;t make sense of. It seems like sequel bait, but it completely spits in the face of everything the final arc was about, making the last nine episodes feel like more of a waste of time. All this being said, the actual resolutions for each character outside of all of this are really sweet and pretty satisfying, though what comes before it is legitimately awful.<br />
<br />
tl;dr: a great story that manages to drop the ball spectacularly in the final few episodes. If you&#039;re going to have a tonal shift in the final arc, at least follow through. Also, the way they pulled off the final con was stupid at best and reminded me of a quote from Community which I will paraphrase: So, according to the Sting, in order to pull off this grift, we need a full crew, a bunch of briefcases, and a fake hospital for some reason.<br />
<br />
Art: 9 <br />
Yeah, the art is mostly really great and expressive, but the CGI looks genuinely awful. Even though the CGI is stylized, it still looks super jarring and it&#039;s even worse when characters are modeled with CGI. Everyone keeps comparing this show to Lupin, but Lupin&#039;s recent anime and films blow GP out of the water completely.<br />
<br />
Muisic: 8<br />
A pretty above average soundtrack overall, though there are quite a few tracks that blend in with one another. The vocal tracks are all pretty excellent, though. <br />
<br />
Characters: 6<br />
Again, for the first half of the show, the characters are all really great. Edamura is a likable lead, Laurent is incredibly funny and commands the screen when he&#039;s on, Abbie is one of the most charming characters of the year, and Cynthia just oozes with charisma. Plus, each of these leads has a really compelling backstory and character motivation, and each is given some genuinely superb character development throughout the series. The villains are all fairly one-note, but it works in the show&#039;s favor because it gets you to really despise them. The one stand out is Suzaku, the villain of the final arc, who is not only despicable, but sympathetic in a way because she develops a really compelling relationship with Makoto, almost becoming like a surrogate mother to him. Unfortunately, the main cast outside of Abbie all become genuinely insufferable during the final arc and that&#039;s when you realize that they&#039;ve been self-serving, hypocritical narcissists for the entire series and have been insanely cruel to Makoto for almost no reason, seemingly enjoying his suffering and treating him as a joke throughout the entire series -- literally none of the characters actually call him by his proper name. As a minor spoiler, I think it&#039;s really telling that while Makoto is basically in the middle of a mental breakdown after a severely traumatic event, the rest of the cast is at a hot spring having the time of their lives -- it really shows how awful the rest of the cast are, which makes the resolution even more frustrating when none of them actually get what&#039;s coming to them in spite of Makoto&#039;s really passionate and eloquent rant about why he hates them all. Again, like the story, the characters are great until you realize that everyone but Makoto is a legitimate piece of shit who never gets theirs.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
I think the one takeaway from my review is that it&#039;s a really enjoyable show and if you just ignore the final arc, the show&#039;s probably like a 9/10. Unfortunately though, you can&#039;t just pretend that almost half of the show doesn&#039;t exist. Maybe I&#039;m an outlier in terms of how I wanted the ending to play out, but from what I&#039;ve seen online, I&#039;m not the only person upset with the ending in general. A bad ending can really mar what could have been a great show -- just look at GoT -- and Great Pretender has joined the ranks of other really promising shows that just couldn&#039;t follow through in the final stretch. It&#039;s the first show in a long time that has genuinely made me feel conflicted after watching it, not sure if it was worth my time or not. I enjoyed it, but I was only able to tolerate the show&#039;s absurdity up to a point.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
I was really rooting for this show, and it was genuinely the most fun I&#039;ve had with anime in a really long time. However, I just can&#039;t look past its ending and final arc in general. The writers seemed to through everything fun and compelling about the show out the window in the final arc in favor of a forced tonal shift that they didn&#039;t even have the guts to follow through with. I know my other scores average out to about a 7, but I felt that it deserved to be docked another point for the post credits scene, which just felt like a slap in the face after an already flawed and frustrating arc. <br />
<br />
Overall tl;dr:<br />
A good show that had a lot of potential, but completely squandered it in the final 9 episodes.<br />

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
“You can’t rely on anyone but yourself”, this quote is perfect for explaining the “Great Pretender”, every character in this world is fighting for themselves, trying to survive, being a lone wolf, and when a pack of hungry wolves group up, things get heated, really fast.<br />
<br />
As one of many Netflix original anime shows, Great Pretender was released and was not given the proper promotional treatment it definitely deserved and is a big contender for anime of the year 2020.<br />
<br />
The story is straightforward and does not try to expand on the plot, predictable but nevertheless enjoyable, it realizes it’s simplicity and makes the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review375581">
        best use of it, that is until the last arc, which is the worst one out of the bunch. The way the plot was structured was amazing, the character interactions were magnificent, but then it slipped on it’s own tail and got lost in all of the plot twists that happened within a few episodes, the stakes got lost during this arc, it felt like the main characters will just somehow get away with anything cast at them, any problem they had faced was already prepared for, planned to the smallest detail beforehand. In previous arcs, the shock value was present, but not the main moving point of the story, in the final arc, the shock value is so great and the story relies so heavily on it that the rewatch potential is almost nonexistent. Despite all of that, the ending felt satisfactory enough to not entirely erase all of the previous good and innovative things the show has done and was a nice closing point for the show and all of it’s characters.<br />
<br />
The characters are really what made this show special, from the small fish that outgrew the tank, Makoto, to the one person that was pulling the strings all along and was the person in charge, Laurent, each member of the main crew had their own personality, their reasons for becoming a swindler, a “confidence man”, their reasons to get back at the rich, at the people that took them all they ever had, all they ever wanted in life. Each of the cast members represents a different emotion; Cynthia was destroyed by her lover’s greed, cold heartedness and Coleman’s dirty nature to use people and then throw them into debt. Abigail represents being stuck in the past, bound by revenge, her whole life she was looking for the people that killed her friends, her only family. When faced with the option to act on her lifelong revenge, Abigail leaves the past behind, lives in the present and faces the future, she begins to open up, express her emotions, the shell that was once “protecting” her from the outside world, from feeling like she has lost something, has finally opened and Abigail is a completely different person, able to feel, her life looking colorful for the first time. Laurent is an example of wanting revenge and acting on it, he did not care that he was living in the past, he cast aside his morals, ideals and beliefs all for the sake of getting back at the person who took the only person he has ever loved away from him, Laurent has spent years preparing, setting all of the necessary things up, all to destroy one man’s life, the man that rid him of his everything, his world. On the outside, Laurent is just a regular lowlife that enjoys bringing agony and despair into other people’s lives, but on the inside he is hurting just as much, if not more, than any other person we see in this series, he was always present in the story in one way or another, it felt as though he would always be behind something, doing something in the back row of the operation, making the life of everyone around him even harder.<br />
<br />
Makoto Edamura is a character that made us believe he will be a secondary character in his own story, being only a stepping stone for Laurent to achieve even greater heights with new ideas and operations, but he fooled the audience in the last arc, even though Makoto was on Laurent’s side, he still managed to outsmart him and make him look scared, defeated, and that was enough for Makoto. Seeing him grow from being too scared to talk to someone he didn’t know to becoming the greatest swindler ever and deceiving multiple people at once and still staying calm, Makoto’s development was evident with each new job he found himself stumbling into, at first he was a timid, scared teenager who had found himself in a new environment and was completely lost. Once Makoto tasted the thrill of deceit, he could not let it go, he let himself loose and was enjoying life, but there was one thing that was constantly on the back of his mind. His father Oz. Makoto and Oz had amazing parallels and similarities which they both did not notice, Makoto was caring but also immature, Oz was a cold man who knew how to process the situation calmly at all times, while Makoto grew, so did his love for his father, which had not left him completely. <br />
<br />
The way Great Pretender plays with stakes is amazing. It feels like they are high enough to ruin the lives of the main cast, but just low enough for them to be able to bounce back, this is shown with Laurent’s character, it feels like he has nothing to lose but in reality, if he loses and gets jailed, he will never be able to avenge Dorothy, that revenge being his only goal and the only thing that is keeping him alive and struggling. With every operation, the stakes rose; They went from simple few million to billions of dollars and it was all very well executed, as the cast’s bond grew stronger, so did their opponents, people they had to outsmart and steal from.<br />
<br />
The villains were nothing too special, but were also above average, ranging from art’s equivalent of James Bond to a child trafficking organization chairman, we, along with the crew, met various people, all of whom were evil one way or another and deserved what they got, the Ibrahim brothers were the perfect duo for this story, one being the young, talented, sexy, athlete brother while the other was supporting and making his life easier from the shadows, always being serious and suspicious of others, never letting his guard down.<br />
<br />
The art was simply breathtaking, it was vivid, colorful, new, innovative, creative, the color palette was vast, colorful and unlike any that this medium has offered so far, every little scene felt alive, natural and realistic, it felt like the audience was there, that we were there with the crew, seeing these vast and new colors felt like a breath of fresh air among the mainly monotone colors anime tends to use, Netflix and WIT Studio went all out on enhancing this show’s impact even further.<br />
<br />
The sound was amazing. From the OST to the Ending, every bit of it was enjoyable and new, the Ending is one of the most creative pieces of music paired with a video that this medium has ever seen, and is in my personal favorites and will stay that way for a long time.<br />
<br />
All things considered, this was a really fulfilling, exciting and unforgettable experience, art, characters, arcs, I loved all of it. Great Pretender is not for everyone, it is a very unique experience that I doubt we will ever see again. A real hidden gem and a one of a kind anime. Along with Kaguya-Sama Season 2, this is my pick for the best anime of 2020.<br />

    People often like to dramatize how they feel about any given show for the sake of being theatrical, but I&#039;m telling the truth when I say that the Great Pretender is one the best, and most dissapointing anime I&#039;ve seen.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s visually stunning, with a great soundtrack and an appealing premise. And for the first half of the series everything is smooth sailing. It&#039;s nothing mind blowing, but the presentation and banter between the cast keeps things light and fast paced. Each arc focuses on one of the main characters and their backstory in an intelligent and well put together way.<br />
<br />
Except the last arc. Which is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review372064">
        a complete trainwreck narratively, morally and themetically. Aside from the deceptive way that the story is edited to come out with a twist that makes you scratch your head, everything leading up to that final moment is a disaster. I&#039;ll spare you the spoilers, but the show lets the audience down with a flimsy final act that says nothing and doesn&#039;t advance the characters in a meaningful way.<br />
<br />
That is to say, the Great Pretender is a show of two halves. The first is everything you could want, the second asks you to leave your brain at the door - because engaging critically even slightly with the events that unfold and their implications (and lack thereof) on the characters, will only upset you. The fact that the bad part of the show is longer than any other induvidual arc is an extra kick in the teeth.<br />
<br />
The main character, Edamura, gets the short end of the stick in terms of development. While the other characters have development that starts and ends within their own arcs, Edamura&#039;s resolution never arrives even though the series pretends that it has. This is thanks to a messy back half. Edamura never has a moment where he gets one over on Laurent, who for all intents and purposes is his main rival. And the most important revalations that are aimed at him are concealed from the character, meaning we never see his reaction to them.<br />
<br />
With all that said, it&#039;s still an above average production. I would reccomend it to people, but my feelings on the final arc are a serious detriment to the whole package.

    TLDR Review at the bottom. Hopefully, that helped, thank you for reading it in advance.<br />
<br />
Pretending. People do that. People pretend a lot. And whilst that may seem like something that could get to the wrong side of people once they have been uncovered, it does show that there is an interesting story to be told in each pretender people come to pass. I find myself being a pretender to the people I am with, whether it be family or friends, or just random strangers you get into a conversation with every now and then. Hell, even the people you may talk to on the internet

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356663">
        are probably pretenders. But why? What is the point? Do pretenders just try to hide their true nature out of embarrassment, or maybe trying to keep a low-key life? Or maybe, just for deceptions. Like some kind of con artist constantly working. <br />
<br />
That is what leads us to, from the studio behind Attack on Titan, Great Pretender. It may look a bit questionable at first due to its licensor being Netflix, being known for not the most promising of anime licenses with a few exceptions. But I can say that Great Pretender is one of those exceptions. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story - 7:<br />
We start off with Edamura joining the dark side which leads to him encountering Laurent and thus begins a new life of swindling. The execution and pacing for the start of the story are done pretty well, the story doesn&#039;t take too long to get into business, and there are no unnecessary prolonged plot devices used for the sake of character development, of course, character development is needed, just not so early on when the story is barely set.<br />
<br />
Rather than the start being bad, it is just what happens next. The story is consistent with what plots it gives, I mean, this is a story about con artists, after all, but that is just what was given. Con after con, nothing other than that which poses a big change in the story happens, it is quite a shame with the potential the story has. This isn&#039;t to say that the story in itself is bad, in fact, there are good stories within each cons, even though some are better than others, it is just that this one-way system of scripting doesn&#039;t give much variety, hindering possible chances to improve the story. Another problem with the story, more so the writing is when a story is very consistent in terms of how they bring forth plots due to the world&#039;s logic given at hand it usually is because that story uses an episodic formula to give a story. But that isn&#039;t the case with the show, or should I say that Great Pretender pretends to be somewhat episodic... the characters of the story (which will be in the character section of the review) will show why the show becomes conflicting at this point. What I will point out, however, even in this negative light I have seen the show in, within each con, there is a focus on a particular character for a said story arc, alongside the actual con happening. This all placed in a respectable fashion and not just thrown whenever the story needed to develop characters. What the show comes across makes me think that the show is rather confusing with what it wants to give, there no obvious set goal overarching the story, which brings an understandable consistent bases used for a story arc, yet as said before, it uses vague hints of trying to be something else, something where there is a set goal at hand. Whilst this doesn&#039;t actually harm the story greatly, it is still there to point out the flaw does actually harm the story&#039;s writing.<br />
<br />
The pacing and executions are done well which brings me no problems to complain about that. The dedicated few episodes for one arc is enough for something not too drawn out, or so quick that it will trip up due to a rushed script. Execution too, everything didn&#039;t seem out of place in the sense of connecting each plot element together. <br />
<br />
All in all, pretty good story. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art/Visuals - 8:<br />
The visuals aren&#039;t the best that Wit Studio can pull, but it is certainly not bad. In fact, the style looks quite original from what I have come across in my time of watching anime, it uses a really basic colour system but it is all bright and vibrant to produce this shining atmosphere. You can see the very strong colour gradients used to sperate the lighter colours from their darker counterparts and it really does a good job at setting the vivid atmosphere that was intended.<br />
<br />
The animation itself was handled in a good way too. There was a nice fluid motion to the movements whether it is the physical characters, the vehicles, or the other irrelevant entities showing on the screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound/Audio - 9:<br />
Now the sound is great, it really is awesome. I am not going to lie, I haven&#039;t listened to Freddie Mercury but after hearing &quot;The Great Pretender&quot;, I was really into the song to the point where I just hum or sing it at home somewhere. It is super catchy and it relates well to all the characters within Great Pretender, it is quite a clever use of the song which further enhances its impact on the audio category. &quot;Someday&quot; by YVY ft Emarie naturally, didn&#039;t have as great of an impact like &quot;The Great Pretender&quot;, but it was still beautiful to listen to. With astounding vocals, to all the singers, Freddie Mercury, YVY and Emarie. This show surely knows when to whip out good music for the audience.<br />
<br />
On the non-vocal side of things, the show is filled with fast pace jazz here and there usually used to convey a better scene in situations such as outsmarting or escaping the enemy. The OP uses fast-paced jazz too but it is on the same level as the other OST used throughout the show.<br />
<br />
On a voicing side of things, as someone who yearns for accents when voicing a foreign character, the show did one better and instead uses the intended language, literally, for each different character. For example, you will hear English (99% of the show is in Japanese for convenience to the Japanese audience but there is literal English used) and French used. The VCs retain the accents too. The VCs did a great job at voicing the different languages the character use, although I am not certain if there were different VCs for different languages. Plus points anyways for effort.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character - 7:<br />
I said that the show comes across as episodic due to characters. When I look over it, I think this due to Edamura&#039;s behaviour, he just conflicts with himself. One moment he is swindling the next he is being a good man, and the cycle continues indefinitely. In a show literally titled Great Pretender, you could say that it is clever in the sense that he is a pretender where he is a great swindler one moment, but realistically, he is a good man with good intentions. As much as I would want to agree with this take on his character, it is obvious that that is just a plot device needed for him to exist in the show. The number of times Edamura switches his intentions is just incredible. To be fair, it is usually due to some convenient plot device the writers just kinda half-assed their way through. But it goes to show that the show uses Edamura when it is convenient, which is more or less all the time, even if he himself as a character has other life plans for himself.<br />
<br />
Apart from that, the characters aren&#039;t anything special. Other than they are all pretenders. Every MC is a pretender in some aspect, whether it be hiding a broken past, hiding your good intentions or hiding past relationships. In a show that doesn&#039;t go into the topic of lying to one&#039;s true self, the show does indeed use its character to create connotations of, well, the greatest pretenders. The character development for each character does take its time but it gets there eventually, in addition to development there are insights on the characters too, using flashbacks here and there to show what said character has been through in their lives. Though I can only say that most of this applies to everyone who isn&#039;t Edamura. I felt that his insight was good, but his development is weaker than the other characters.<br />
<br />
Side characters are in a come and go situation, which would make sense since these con artists travel the world a lot. But even these come and go side characters do have the respect they deserve. Character insights and developments are used on them in the same respect as MCs, and whilst these characters don&#039;t last the entire show, they do make for some memorable characters.<br />
<br />
Conclusion, good characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 8:<br />
Man the show makes for a good watch, great swindlers using all kinds of rigged systems to con the hell out of their targets. seeing each target fall into cleverly placed traps made for a really enjoyable watch. The false behaviours, the false associations, everything, it&#039;s all fake, but it works. And whilst this is the formula used over and over again, the show does have its fair share of funny moments and wholesomeness. The con artists conning people does not seem to be boring, it is fun to watch every time. It isn&#039;t overused though, which makes it even better.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall - 7.8 (8)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
TLDR Review:<br />
<br />
Story - 7: Just cons all around, no other major plot. Also, the plot seems kinda confusing with its end goal.<br />
Art/Visuals - 8: Great stuff, really vibrant colours used as well as well made animation.<br />
Sound/Audio - 9: Great vocalists ranging from Freddie Mercury and YVY<br />
Character - 7: Everyone is a good character expect for Edamura and his conflictions. Also, there is a connotation for being a pretender in each MC<br />
Enjoyment - 8: Very entertaining cons pulled off, with a side of comedy and wholesome moments every now and then. <br />
Overall - 7.8 (8)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, I didn&#039;t even know what to expect, looking at the trailer I thought something out of Rush Hour would play, but damn I was wrong, not by a lot though. With its westaboo atmosphere, you could imagine why. If there is anything the show will leave you off with, it is the song &quot;The Great Pretender&quot; especially if you don&#039;t listen to Freddie Mercury. And so I leave you with the some on the lyrics, pretty much explaining most characters in the story as well as, who knows?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, I&#039;m the great pretender // Pretending that I&#039;m doing well // My need is such; I pretend too much // I&#039;m lonely but no one can tell.&quot;

    For someone who avoids writing reviews this is a first for me, I heard about this series when the trailer dropped a few months back and I was drawn in by the art style and the whole &#039;swindling heist&#039; genre.<br />
Now that I have completed I can say that its such a breath of fresh air from your usual<br />
seasonal anime with generic tropes.<br />
this show is a tribute to the ocean series (yes the Hollywood one), the show actually makes an effort and comes pretty close to replicating a semi realistic heists.<br />
the music is heavily inspired by jazz and bebop (reminds you of a certain show...) which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353227">
        is just a cherry on top.<br />
the animation and art style are very unique and the work done by wit studios shows the effort and research they put in. you can literally screenshot any Frame and it will be a good wallpaper.<br />
one thing I love about this show is the fact that they don&#039;t waste time with stretched out backstories its just the relevant parts.<br />
you will get hooked on from the first episode itself.<br />
highly recommend this.

    Great delivery all around. Currently on ep 13 as I write this review. <br />
Lets set aside the fact it&#039;s on Netflix and won&#039;t catch the light of day easily, however, god dang!<br />
<br />
The music and art are phenomenal, you&#039;re immediately hooked from the first episode. Every scene from the anime is wallpaper worthy and is so unique. The music is great and sets the mood super well. Especially during their &quot;vanishing act&quot;, which I absolutely love. <br />
<br />
The animation is a given because of WIT studio and people may be mad since WIT didn&#039;t do AOT yadda yadda but gosh! I&#039;m so happy they did Great Pretender.<br />
<br />
Love

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344632">
        the characters, they&#039;re all super unique and fun. Edamura is really cute lol~ <br />
Several plot twist in this story and I think you&#039;ll love great pretender no matter what you&#039;re looking for!!<br />
10/10 for me~

    WIT Studio did NOT come to fuck around.<br />
<br />
Review is for the very first arc of the series (ep 1-5)<br />
<br />
Characters are (overall) solid - but what REALLY was the icing on the cake for this series was the pacing, soundtrack, and twists and turns this series offers. You walk in thinking &quot;don&#039;t trust anyone&quot; and walk out thinking &quot;don&#039;t trust ANYTHING&quot;. Everyone gets shot, everyone&#039;s a traitor, everyone&#039;s scummy - but Wit Studio does it all so spectacularly that I don&#039;t even care. Every episode keeps me on my feet, every episode the situation changes. I&#039;ve seen some others say that some of the events are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343900">
        predictable - but so far I haven&#039;t really felt that way. <br />
<br />
The only problem I have is mostly with the main character. He feels really inconsistent - and while inconsistency isn&#039;t always terrible in a character - here Edamura really jumps back and forth between being a crafty bad guy and being a moral, goody two shoes that&#039;s kind to everyone. Of course, this series shows that &#039;bad&#039; guys definitely can have a &#039;good&#039; side to them - like Salazar - but while Edamura feels like a coinflip depending on whether the show is forcing us to try and like him, Salazar&#039;s story feels much more developed and in touch with reality. Edamura&#039;s back story feels incredibly forced. <br />
<br />
Overall, Great Pretender is so far a GREAT series to pick up.

    What can I say? That anime caught me in a way that I didn&#039;t think it would. It&#039;s fantastic.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
What makes a memorable story? Twists, deep plots, reflections? For me, the only thing that matters is how you can stay true to the things that are presented and stick to it. Great Pretender does that. The characthers are so smart and think two steps foward at any occasion, that&#039;s a constant in the anime. The thing that I don&#039;t like that much is that sometimes it come up a little bit forced. Many times it looks like they have no obstacle to overcome and things

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353558">
        just work exactly like they want.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
Hands down one of the most beautiful animes I have ever watched. Perfection.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
The sound makes this anime what it is. It fits amazingly at the scenes, so well thought.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
I love all of them, from protagonists to secondary, even though the bad guys are many times just... bad, nothing much more about it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10 <br />
Didn&#039;t get bored a single time And I will say more: I was thrilled the whole time.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9,4/10<br />
It&#039;s a great anime, really. It&#039;s not perfect, but it comes close.

    I haven&#039;t seen any comments about Great Pretender yet, but I can already foresee the many free praise for his art, which consists of a palette of colors quite different from the usual, but which does not suit the unity of the rest of the work at all.<br />
<br />
The truth is, I liked Great Pretender. It has a very dynamic and hurried plot, and this is very well combined with this agile cinematography at almost every moment. I think that the innovation of anime comes from this vitality of movements in animation, and that goes well with this narrative that is more down to earth and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365600">
        unpredictable at the same time.<br />
<br />
What prevents anime from boosting this feeling of dynamism to the rest of the other elements that I praised earlier, is this choice of an ultra stylized and unnecessary art. The truth is that mixing this glamor with a sophisticated look from the director sounds much more personal than it should, I don&#039;t think that was the right tone that Great Pretender should preserve.<br />
<br />
In some moments I even liked it, it gives a change of tones between the palette of colors to try to reflect some emotions for the viewer. It would even be possible to say that this free mannerism of the director could be aimed at his characters. If he had used this feature only in specific moments, it would be ok, but the scenarios insist on staying that way in several moments, which ends up harming even in the dramatic construction, it does not differ at all from any other situations that are occurring.<br />
<br />
It could have been the best anime of the year if the director hadn&#039;t been so mannerist with no justifiable purpose.
