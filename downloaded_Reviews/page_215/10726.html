    Hatena Illusion is a &quot;lovely&quot; anime that will shock every viewer. It is perfect for those that enjoy watching anime that have slow pace. <br />
I wonder why is included tag ecchi. I watched all episodes and didn&#039;t find there even slightest track of it.<br />
<br />
Story 2/10,<br />
I would say that story of this anime is something that you can&#039;t easily appraise here. It is simple-minded with a simple plot. The whole story is nothing special. Every other anime out there has a better story.<br />
<br />
Art 5/10,<br />

    A foreword to mangaka Tomohiro Matsu: we are sorry with deep condolences for your loss of life, but some people just can&#039;t stop trashing your work a lot more. If you are still alive, please stop people from taking advantage of a deceased&#039;s work and not caring one bit about the work that you&#039;ve laboriously done.<br />
<br />
Most of the mangaka&#039;s works are average, with Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai! being the best and this series being the worst. And apparently I don&#039;t know the people over at newbie studio Children&#039;s Playground Entertainment&#039;s work ethics are like, using a dead man&#039;s work as its first production? HELL

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333063">
        NO.<br />
<br />
Everything is trash, PERIOD. Story, boring as hell (though the similarity of this and Märchen Mädchen are the magical segments, but I&#039;d take the latter any day). Characters, one-note and just serving their purposes to be nothing but nuisances. Art, horrible with overzealousness passion. Sound, very forgettable.<br />
<br />
Do I feel like a long review is worth this show? Apparently not, short ones like this are more than enough to show the magic evidence of why this show should be avoided at all costs.

    	‘’If you come into Hatena Illusion without any expectations, like me who came in knowing absolutely nothing, you might actually come to enjoy this show more that you think. If you do expect this show to be up to par for its genre tags i.e. Ecchi, then you might be disappointed, but other than that, Hatena Illusion has been frankly, rather good for what it currently offers.’’ <br />
<br />
WELL BOY O BOY, that was what I wanted to say after watching the first episode, but damn, the following episodes were just, disappointing, there is just too much flaw compared to what the first episode’s premise showed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327698">
        us, and I’ll explain in detail with the following. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story / Character -5.5-<br />
A pretty generic plot, our MC Makoto Shiranui, as him name ‘Shira(不知)nui’ kinda suggest, is quite dull, but he is ambitious enough that he travels all the way to Tokyo in hopes to become an apprentice of the famous Magician, whom coincidentally is his childhood friend, our female protagonist’s father. Her daughter, Hate… Oh I mean Kana-chan, your typical tsundere, actually is quite a likable character (maybe I’m just biased to tsunderes) other than the times where she kinda 180 degree turn her emotions too fast, well it is to be expected, though surprisingly Hatena does have quite a bit of self-consciousness and do apologize for her mistakes, which is kinda a nice touch. Story starts out with Kana-chan mistakenly thinking that Makoto-kun is a female since younger age, and when she realizes it she becomes extra aware and cautious, especially when she founds out that Makoto has a ‘Artifact’, which are items created by Kana’s mother which posses actual magic power. However, many Artifacts has been stolen and Hatena wants to reclaim them back as these magic powers could cause great disaster had they been on the wrong hands. Then comes the more standard ‘Good’ vs ‘Bad’ action scenes, relationships between our both main protagonists deepen, and more plot points get reveal. <br />
<br />
Personally I don’t mind such a plot, but the problem with the show is that it feels like they are trying to cramp too much info into a single episode, which ultimately leads to pacing problems, and it really does show on almost all episodes after the first. The show honestly could benefit a lot simply by extending the dialogues and make the interactions between character longer, instead of having each character saying one important line, and the story just progresses. One can barely even be invested into the characters if they don’t even have enough screen time to start with. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art -6-<br />
By the studio that goes by this ridiculous name, Children’s Playground Entertainment, certainly not making this show as children friendly as they sound. Animation was pretty good for the first episode, following few are mediocre at best, where there are scenes that are rather janky, especially the face expressions, pan out shots of the scenes really suffers from the ‘6-year-old drawing’ look. For an ecchi, it really doesn’t show much of this genre throughout these few episodes, there are some here and there, well they do look decent on the times when they do show it, but nothing phenomenal. There are also scenes where it kinda makes me have flashbacks for my sister is a writer anime, well, let&#039;s hope it doesn’t go down that route. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound -7- <br />
The better part of the show, parts of this show does get salvaged by the fact that they have quite good OSTs, and most importantly, one of my favorite OPs this season, Magic Words by a debut singer, Liyuu is absolutely fantastic, very catchy, and I really like the rhythm and the light hearted feel to it. Voice acting is very good, as expected for the master VA for harem Matsuoka, well also not belittling the other VAs, again, probably the saving grace of this show. Following the same trend, the first episode had really good sound designs, then the next episodes just went downhill from there. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall -6-<br />
This is your average ‘goes under the radar because it is generic’ show of the season, if you can look pass the very cliché moments of the anime, well I certainly could recommend you to watch Hatena Illusion as of the episodes aired until now, assuming that you have free time on your hand and don’t mind watching something that isn’t that unique. For now, there is a lot of room for the show to improve, and I do hope that the story goes more in depth as there are quite a few interesting plot devices that the show can really dive in more in the future episodes, but as the story stands now, it really is kinda underwhelming after what I would consider a great first episode. <br />

    I like magic, you like magic, we all like magic! Well, unless you don’t, I guess there are some people like that. Magic comes in various forms. Oftentimes the type we see in anime tends to be the fantasy type of magic. I.e. people who control fire, water, earth, wind, ice, lighting, yatta yatta, etc. They live in worlds often full of magical creatures, and do magical things magically, of course. I find it interesting how the word “magic” now triggers these types of thoughts in people because of how popular this “fantasy” type of magic has become. But as much as I like that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343716">
        type of magic (believe me I do) that is not what we are going to be talking about today.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 Instead, I will be talking about the magician type of magic. No, not the fantasy type! Not the staff-wielding ones! I’m talking about the good old fashion illusionist type of magic. “Why?” you may ask. Because that’s exactly what (or it should have been) Hatena Illusion is all about! Published in 2014 and written by Tomohiro Matsu, Hatena Illusion is a romantic comedy light novel that ran four volumes long until it’s creator’s unfortunate death in 2016 at the young age of 43 from liver cancer. In 2018 it received a manga, and finally, on January 9th, 2020, Hatena Illusion received a 12 episode anime series adaption by Children’s Playground Entertainment. Not the most, eh, well known of studios, we’ll say, but that doesn’t always mean anything. Of the few works they did that numbered about 6, only one of them really stands out to me as being memorable and that was Citrus, though based on who you ask, that’s either a good thing or a bad thing. Regardless, a lesser-known studio doesn’t mean something has to be bad.<br />
 The anime was directed by Shin Matsuo. Though this was his first director position, he had worked as episode director and animation director for various things, including a couple One Piece movies, a few episodes of both Ouran Highschool Host Club and Tokyo Ghoul, as well as doing key animation for a few things, such as the 4th Pokemon movie and some episodes of Soul Eater. So our director does have a decent resume, despite being new to his position.<br />
 So, was Hatena Illusion very good? I don’t want to tell you that right now. You have to read on and find out. Hey, don’t look at me like that. I need to have some fun! Ok, you’re bored? Ok, how about a trick? First pick a card, well, in your imagination. Now close your eyes, stroll down a bit and open them again!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Now I’m safely down here. Tada! The card served no purpose. I never said I was very good, did I? Leave the illusions to the illusionists as I always say! Ahem! Anyway. Our story begins with Makoto Shiranui, a young boy who aspires to one day be a magician that can replace all the sadness in the world with happiness. Both because of a promise he made to his childhood friend, Kana (Hatena) Hoshisato and to accomplish his own dreams, he travels to the Hoshisato household to study under Kana’s father Mamoru, the magician he looks up to more than anyone else. Upon arrival in the Hoshisato residence, Kana realizes that her childhood friend and “prince” was more of a “prince” than she had originally thought when she learns that Makoto wasn’t a girl that dressed like a boy, but just a boy after all! Who’d have thought it? Kana’s more progressive than any of us! With this news in tow, Kana gains a bitter attitude towards Makoto and wants him to leave immediately. Which might have been a possibility had Makoto not been the clumsiest human on earth, knocking over and breaking a vase in the Hoshisato residence. Now he must become a butler to pay off his debt to the family but don’t worry he’s still allowed to go to school because anime. Eventually, Makoto learns of the oddities in possession of the Hoshisato mansion and its occupants: strange magical items called “Artifacts” that were once stolen and abused by those who were never to know of their existence. To stop this from happening, Kana’s mother, Maeve, became a thief to steal back the artifacts and keep them from evil hands, which she does with her husband Mamoru at her side. Kana, wanting to help her parents in their endeavors, is a thief in training using her artifact, Muff-Kun, to help her fulfill her duties. As if all of this wasn’t enough for the young magician-in-training, Makoto discovers that his magic wand Maeve gave him was also an artifact. Donning his artifact’s true power and naming it the...wait for it…”Smile Stick,” Makoto assists Hatena with her thievery as her one and only partner. And thus, the story of the thief who swears to steal sadness and the magician who vows to replace it with happiness begins.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 Truthfully, the story is a little odd. I like it, but I wish it was more about the actual magician business and less about the artifacts themselves. I originally was interested in Hatena Illusion for one reason: the artwork showed Kana and Makoto all dressed up in something that reminded me of a phantom (or gentlemen) thief, which is a concept I’ve been incredibly fascinated with ever since I first played Persona 5. Hatena Illusion kind of disappoints me there. It is very much about thievery, but only part of that is shown. It’s more like the anime is largely about Kana saying she’ll be a thief, but a small portion of it is her actually doing it. And when you finally get to the heist it’s over almost as soon as it began. As an example, the last arc revolves around the cast finding three special artifacts. Makoto and Hatena set out to find one of them. There&#039;s a solid episode and a half building up to this, and once they get there, they walk into a room, spook some guys with guns, and walk out. I could have gotten the artifact more stylishly than they did. Maybe they should learn something from the Phantom Thieves! Sorry, I got carried away there. As I did before my little outburst, I want to talk about the story arcs a bit. Most of the arcs are character-driven, which is generally good and I don’t exactly mind it here, I just think it takes away from the actual purpose of what the story should have been. I mean the first arc builds upon Makoto and Kana and introduces you to the artifacts. It’s fine and understandable they would start there. Then from there each of the main characters get an episode or two (or three) dedicated to them, and before you know it you&#039;re already at the end. I suppose it’s more that 12 episodes really wasn’t enough to focus on the characters, because as I said, it means the thievery and the magic plays second fiddle to it. It isn’t about a “master thief” stealing artifacts, It’s about a girl sorting out her family problems and occasionally doing some thievery. What should have been the main point only shows up typically at the end of each arc for a few minutes. It’s disappointing. However, when the anime does things right, they’re done right.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think Hatena Illusion has a great sense of humor and is its main strong point. Whether it’s from Mamoru’s desperate attempts to get his daughters’ attention or his...eccentricities, we’ll call it, Makoto’s ridiculous magic such as making a flower come out of the barrel of a gun that is pointed at his face (yes that happens) for defense, or just the amazing butler with the most butleriest name ever, Jeeves, Hatena Illusion never failed to make me laugh. Even if part of that was just because of how ridiculous the story was at times. Kana’s whole point is to steal sadness, right? It certainly did that more than a few times for me. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Though I admit her tsundere tropes did annoy me a bit, Kana isn’t as bad as others I’ve seen before. She felt like more of a tsundere just because, I suppose. Like they wanted to make her one, and every now and then threw in a scene where she acts like one to be like “look, fanboys, a tsundere!” But unlike a lot of tsundere’s she actually shows some growth by the end of the story, albeit it’s a little. Character growth you say? What a novel concept! Considering the story is character-driven that should mean the characters had time to develop, which they kind of did, at least some of them. Makoto and Kana get a decent amount of growth, but their relationship doesn’t really change much past the first arc where they’re like “be my partner!’ to each other and stare off into the sunset. Honestly, Kana’s little sister Yumemi (who’s story arc is super sweet and my favorite, except that it’s too long) is probably closer to Makoto than her sister even is. At least she’s hugged him once and never tried to kill him. Sadly Makoto and Kana get mostly stagnant, as far as their relationship goes, but they do both grow in their own ways. Such as at the end of the series Kana not punching Makoto into oblivion at the mere mention of a compliment, which as we know is an amazing accomplishment for one of her species<br />
<br />
<br />
Jeeves the butler, is basically a butler, but as I mentioned, he is the most butler-like butler to ever—um— butler...so yeah, take that as you will. Ema, the Hoshisato maid, gets quite a few episodes to her, yet she’s still largely the most uninteresting character to me. I think it took too long to do her arc frankly. I think you could have wrapped it up in like a single episode and sentence. You have some other characters that show up for an episode or two that are mostly forgettable. Seriously, Makoto has some friends in school that are only in the anime for like two scenes. They’re so uninteresting I don’t even remember what one of them looks like. I had to look it up to remember! Don’t even get me to tell you their names, I have a feeling the almighty internet could hardly tell you that. Watch Hatena Illusion, I bet you’ll forget by the end. By the end of the same episode probably. There’s an ok, if not confusing “villain” for most of Hatena Illusion, I have trouble really getting her character. She doesn’t make much sense to me honestly. Her motives—I can’t call them dumb—because they don’t exist! She just kinda does things, for little reason. The main “villain” I suppose would be Maeve&#039;s mother and Kana’s grandmother, but that’s only for one scene at the end of the anime, yeah. 12 episodes is a fickle thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps the biggest character-wise disappointment comes from Mamoru and Maeve, arguably the most important characters, as much of the stuff that happens in Hatena Illusion happens because of them. For mostly the entire Anime Mamoru is out doing god-knows-what, probably magic, so we see very little of him. He pops in (out of literally thin air, because magic) acts as some decent comedy relief then pops back out. You see him a bit in the final arc, but not much. Maeve is unfortunately far worse, as the entirety of the plot, save the final scene, she’s not even there. One time in the middle of the series she shows up as a duplicate from an artifact, but she’s always elsewhere. The last arc is about getting her back home. And the worst part is you&#039;re given no real explanation as to why this is. She’s either stuck finding an artifact, or stuck at her village with her mother, or something else. Like, why can’t you just break her out and bring her home or something? I know her mother is supposed to be strong, but you have tons of artifacts and magic. Just do it! Makoto has vanishing magic that lets him just make things disappear. Like, go bring her back, dude! I just wish that the one that Kana loves and admires so much she makes it her goal in life to be like her was actually shown for more than five minutes in the series. <br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah! Makoto has parents and a sister. He talks to them like once on the phone. I forgot but I suppose he had to be born somehow. Hey, at least they seem loving and actually care about their son. That’s more than you can say for most anime parents.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As I mentioned, the main reason I watched this anime was based on the artwork I saw for it. The funny thing is I didn’t even know it was about a thief, I just knew magic was involved in some way. It just goes to show how much Persona 5 has influenced me when I see these characters in very over the top costumes, I instantly think of it. And I’m talking about this because that was one thing about Hatena Illusion that, to my surprise, I really liked: the art. When the studio making an anime only has a small number of things under their belt, and those things aren’t the most beloved of things, you would expect the art to potentially suffer from it. In Hatena Illusion’s case, that’s not true...completely. Though I&#039;ve seen some conflicting views on this, I like the art style. It’s colorful, vibrant, cheerful even, and I think it’s fit the type of magic story it wants to tell. However, I’ll be the first to admit it suffers from a few things.<br />
One: Hatena Illusion suffers from (though not as bad as other series I’ve seen) a problem I like to call the “first episode curse.” This curse, at least I imagine, is the result of the creator working incredibly hard to make the artwork lovely for the first episode and then realize it would be impossible to keep up the same quality the whole series, thus the following episodes end up being a step down as a result. Hatena Illusion does suffer from this. The first episode is largely the best-looking part of the series, and the rest of the series isn’t as good looking, but it isn’t like the “normal” art is bad. Hatena Illusion’s art ranges from great to mediocre, generally hanging around the pretty good area and dipping into mediocre for certain zoomed out scenes, which are notoriously bad in certain anime, but in Hatena Illusion it isn’t awful I’d say, just noticeable.<br />
The way I’d describe it is the anime has different art qualities it shifts between. Some scenes look fantastic, some look ok, and very few of them look bad. The first episode is largely part of the better-looking art, while the subsequent episodes are a mixture of all of it. But the art, even at its worst will never really offend you, I&#039;ve seen far worse, and more importantly, when it works it works. Albeit the art ends up being a little inconsistent overall. I will admit that.<br />
<br />
<br />
To make mention of another aspect of the art I wasn’t fond of, and this is a nitpicky thing but something that did bother me, when I saw that Makoto was going to actually fight, I got super excited. “Whoa, he’s going to fight with magic?” I wondered happily. I thought maybe we’d get to see him throw cards, or coins, or do all sorts of Illusions. Unfortunately, the fight scenes in Hatena Illusion are underwhelming. The first time we see Makoto fight is when Kana is losing a fight with her aunt because the Hoshisato’s have family issues, he swoops in and does “vanishing magic” to teleport Kana. He then uses “Illusion Magic” to create blades of light to stab his enemies. Neat, and I get it, but I want them to have more fun with it. Freaking throws her in a box and stab it with fake swords like some magic iron maiden thing. Saw her in half! Throw some cards around, show me something! Your hero wears a top hat! However, despite them not running with the idea as much as I like at times, there are some memorable moments. The gun as I said earlier, and also a move where Makoto throws a bunch of doves at a woman, throws a cloth over her and just takes the artifact. I never expected to see magic like that in a fight, and I wish there was more of it. <br />
<br />
<br />
The music that accompanies the fights and other scenes of the show are nice as well. They sound like a piece you would hear as you take your seats, the lights dim, and you look in amazement as your favorite magician takes the stage, ready to perform their magic for all to see. Opening and endings for Hatena Illusion are fine, I prefer the latter. The former is more upbeat as you see the different characters floating in a trippy kaleidoscope-like visual in the background. The art overall is nice, and better than the ending, though I don’t like the song as much. The ending is much more up in your face and gets you pumped to watch the next episode. Art wise is focusing almost entirely on Kana and her being a “master thief.” A few neat visuals such as spotlights flashing by, causing her clothes to change from her normal outfit to her thief attire, to her school uniform. It shows the various identities that she has. I imagine this is the type of song she listens to before a heist to get ready. But I can’t help but laugh when I watch it. It gives off the impression that Kana is such a cool, calm, and collected thief, but she just isn’t. I suppose that’s part of her charm.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, we arrive at the end. The end can be sad sometimes, but it’s also the beginning or something deep and philosophical like that. The ending was what largely disappointed me the most about Hatena Illusion. Not that it was a bad ending, or that I was particularly sad for it to be over, it’s more that had the anime had more than 12 episodes I feel that it truly could have been something special. Had they had more time to flesh out the characters without taking away from time from the thievery. Had more focus been put on actual magic. I’d have loved to see Makoto actually learn some magic, not just use his Smile Stick. I feel like Hatena Illusion ended right when it could have begun. I would have loved to see more adventures of Makoto and Kana. I’d like to see more of Maeve. I&#039;d like to have seen a lot more, and I feel like largely the reason I’m left with these feelings is from the short length of the anime. Could they have used their time better? Sure, they certainly could have. I’ve seen anime with fewer episodes do more. Hatena Illusion could have had its priorities figured out better, but of course, that’s just a difference of opinion. In the same way, I would have loved to see more magic, some people would enjoy the more character-focused story. I just can’t help but see it as a waste. You have the various interesting character’s enveloped in this magical world, yet you choose to focus more on the boring aspects of their life. Like why show two episodes about Yumeimi getting bullied and not wanting to go to school when you could have used that time for something more interesting. Of course, that’s a problem with the source material, not the anime. I just wanted more, more of the interesting setting they gave me. I don’t often run into something that I feel is entirely unique, especially in the often oversaturated landscape that is anime, but that’s what Hatena Illusion was. Never had I have seen (or wanted to see) a young girl with her magical muffler become a master thief to steal sadness along with her tophat-wearing magician partner and all their shenanigans that ensue, but here I am, wishing I had a little more. Hatena Illusion is far from perfect, and I will be the first to tell anyone that, but if you want a unique approach to an anime about magic, give Hatena Illusion a try. I promise, if nothing else, that you will get a kick out of it once or twice.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As always, my opinion isn’t any more or less valid than yours...or Fred&#039;s back there. I would highly recommend not listening to any random idiot on the internet like me and instead go watch Hatena Illusion for yourself and form your own opinion because free will is a pretty neat thing! But I did just tell you not to listen to me, so do what you want, or don’t. I’m starting to confuse myself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways! “Ladies and gentlemen! I must bid you adieu!”<br />
<br />
Wait, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen&quot; is what magicians say when they arrive, not leave? Oh. Now I have to go change the script! Oh, whatever, nobody has to know.<br />
<br />
“Goodbye, Ladies and gentlemen! See you next week!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, it won’t be next week.<br />

After so long I wanted to look at a &quot;Mahou Shoujo&quot; again, but I yearned for it to be more refreshing, bring some Romance and put aside her characteristic &quot;Moe&quot; girl perspective. What in the first instance this title managed to bring me that nostalgia to the best Sakura card captor style with Magic Kaito mix. However, the illusion would only last a few first chapters, since as we entered the story it was only seen more and more simple, so it was not a very criticizable cause at the time because things were happening within Hatena&#039;s mansion, and it was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336483">
        still a nice anime to hang out on.<br />
Now, from chapter 7 it was when everything began to go to the toilet, changing the rhythm of the plot and development. They began to integrate characters into the cast that did not merit and that we did not even have enough causes to have empathy for them (whatever side they were), as if it were not enough about the end, our protagonist duo begins to lose weight both in dialogues and actions and minutes on stage being almost inconsequential about the ending. Honestly I would say that it was only a weight the last 2 chapters and I ended up finishing it more out of obligation than for pleasure, and to top it off they leave us an unfinished ending with a last scene cut out without more .... LOVELY SERVICE.<br />
In short, if you are someone new and looking for some somewhat childish magic, you may like this Anime, but from experience there are many better proposals within the genre than this one.<br />

Luego de tanto tiempo tuve deseos de volver a mirar un &quot;Mahou Shoujo&quot;, pero anhelaba que fuera mas refrescante, trajera algo de Romance y dejara a un lado su perspectiva característica de chicas &quot;Moe&quot;. Lo que en primer instancia este titulo logro traerme esa nostalgia al mejor estilo Sakura card captor con mezcla de Magic Kaito. Sin embargo la ilusión solo duraría unos pocos primeros capítulos, ya que a medida que nos adentramos en la historia solo se la veía mas y mas simple, por lo que no era una causa demasiado criticable en el momento por como se daban las cosas dentro de la mansión de Hatena, y seguía siendo un Anime agradable para pasar el rato.<br />
Ahora, a partir del capitulo 7 fue cuando todo se comenzó a ir al retrete, cambiando el ritmo de la trama y desarrollo. Empezaron a integrar personajes al elenco que no meritaban y que ni siquiera teníamos causas suficientes como para tenerles empatia (ya sean del bando que fuesen), como si fuera poco sobre el final nuestro dúo protagonista comienza a perder peso tanto en diálogos como acciones y minutos en escena siendo casi intrascendentes sobre el final. Sinceramente diría que fue solo un peso los últimos 2 capítulos y lo acabe terminando mas por obligación que por placer, y para rematar nos dejan un final inconcluso con una ultima escena cortada sin mas.... PÉSIMO SERVICIO.<br />
En fin, si eres alguien nuevo y busca algo de magia un tanto infantil tal vez te agrade este Anime, pero por experiencia hay muchas mejores propuestas dentro del genero que este.

    Here I am reviewing another whack anime and Forcing myself to watch garbage, so you guys don&#039;t have to. I review all kinds of anime and I enjoy doing this. Let&#039;s get started with the review, shall we?<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: The story is about friend&#039;s reuniting and Becoming magicians, which sounds fine and dandy, if the anime itself wasn&#039;t boring and slow like a tortoise. I&#039;m not even joking when I say the pacing for this anime is dreadful and I honestly wanted to bang my head against the wall just cause I myself have seen my fair share of trash anime, but Hatena Illusion is legit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369948">
        boring and pointless. This is one of those anime you drop and You drop it with no second thought given towards the anime, NONE AT ALL!<br />
<br />
Art: The art style isn&#039;t anything to brag about either, made by studio Children&#039;s Playground Entertainment which is the same studio that worked on Citrus which is another anime that people tend to have a Love/Hate relationship with and That is cause Citrus tends to have some harsh character designs and Most people walk away from said harsh character designs. The art as I said before isn&#039;t anything special, it legit just your average style of art. <br />
<br />
Sound: The intro is by Liyuu and The track name is &quot; Magic Words &quot;. Now then I don&#039;t mind the intro cause it has a romantic kind of vibe to it and I feel like it actually matches wit the anime itself. Also the intro is really catchy to the point where I actually like it. As for the outro? Hikari Iro no Uta by Aina Suzuki is also nice, very upbeat and It&#039;ll get you in the mood to party. <br />
<br />
Character Development: The character development is very poor within this anime I can literally say that the two main characters lack lots of development and The side characters are pretty much irrelevant since the plot is irrelevant and So is the character development. Notice how it all ties up into a really crappy anime? I do.  <br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment: I honestly disliked this anime, again another anime where the Intro/Outro are worked on while the anime is just boring and paced incorrectly. I feel like this has become another issue ever since we strayed away from the Isekai genre. Too much time goes into the intros and outros and The anime itself is heavily lacking in any content whatsoever. I did not enjoy this at all.<br />
<br />
Overall: I do not recommend watching this anime, unless your a fan of zero plot content and Horrible pacing, then by all means go ahead and Give it a watch. All I can say is this anime was bad and Has no redeeming qualities aside from the Intro/Outro themes. Even the main characters are pointless and That&#039;s something I can&#039;t stand. <br />
<br />
Final Verdict: 3/10 This Anime is BAD<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for giving my review a read and I hope you enjoyed it! I will be doing more reviews along the way and I hope you guys continue to read my reviews. Again, Thanks :D

    What could have been a decent anime ends up feeling like a watered down US children&#039;s cartoon. <br />
<br />
The story starts out with promise when a young boy named Makoto returns to Tokyo to learn magic under a famous magician whose daughter, Kana, was a childhood friend. The viewer is then treated humorous scene where Kana somehow believed that Makoto was female and is not shocked to find out otherwise. Setting up the stage for what could be humorous sexual tension as the two are destined to be paired to work together in pursing &quot;artifacts&quot; of magic power that are dangerous in the wrong hands.<br />
<br />
This never

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368800">
        fully materializes as nearly every moment between Makoto and Kana ends with a bland unfunny thud while rest of the plot sluggishly progresses in a broken mess. Over and over you keep hoping for the spark of humor or some kind of connection between the two characters, but it never happens and after a while it begins to feel like something is missing. <br />
<br />
Only after investigating the Manga does one confirms that a great deal of content has been excessively censored out. Near the end of the season it would be revealed this show was subject to influence by Funimation and other foreign involvement in Anime &quot;Production Committees&quot;. These are essential groups of westerners trying to apply their anti-sexual puritanism and extreme left western political views into Anime. <br />
<br />
All of this was further made possible by the unfortunate death of it&#039;s creator, Tomohiro Matsu, who must be spinning in his grave to have his work butchered like this.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t recommend this Anime for anyone as it&#039;s content has been censored and dumbed down to an extreme. What remains is nothing more that a soulless husk.<br />
<br />

    Eu só fiquei extremamente triste que n tem final véi, eu tava empolgado na história e acabou no meio. Eu gostei bastante da história, personagens e trama mas cortou no meio a história sabe, mas vale a pena gostei do anime. Pela nota, vi que teve muita gente que deu nota baixa, n entendi o pq mas ok né fazer o que.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eu n tenho mais nada a dizer porém eles pedem pra colocar uma Review maior então oi, tudo bem? Eu tô bem, colocando os animes em dia, explorando novos estilos de anime, tá sendo bem legal a quarentena

    A word of warning, some spoilers will be dropped to better tell you how bad it is, I&#039;ll warn again when its show time for the spoilers.<br />
<br />
Hatena☆Illusion… the art, is actually good, I do enjoy the art style, colors included. The OP &amp; ED songs are top notch, I love them both and they make Hatena herself seem so freakin COOL! They also make it seem like this is an anime with a GREAT story to come, however...  that gets mostly thrown out the window with episode 2 and onward. There&#039;s nothing else good about Hatena☆Illusion, which is sad to say as I saw

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333812">
        a diamond in the rough that could be a hidden gem but the anime goes out of its way to infuriate the viewer, throws the great set up mostly out the window as said and makes grand canyon sized plot holes…<br />
<br />
If you can overlook and get past the first three episodes where Hatena treats Mikoto like dirt, (I&#039;ll just mention, she acts like she&#039;s sexist against men, she isn&#039;t but that&#039;s how she comes off thanks to a misunderstanding and how she treats Mikoto as a result) which does stop mostly come the end of episode 3, then what awaits you after that is an anime with INFURIATING plot holes and DUMB crap that you just DO NOT DO!!! &gt;_&lt; <br />
<br />
*Ahem*<br />
<br />
Now for the spoilers so you can decide if this anime is worth your time or not. As said before, plot holes. One of the anime&#039;s set ups is they&#039;re living in a mansion out in broad daylight and putting on magic shows (despite being famous so already a plot hole right there) to hide from the ones after their magical artifacts and to prevent them from being misused. However, later we learn that mansion is OWNED by relatives who&#039;re the ones after their stuff and it doesn&#039;t stop there. Hatena&#039;s Mom? The one who can create these artifacts these people are after? is basically staying with the one in charge (We never see this as of 8 episodes in, its merely mentioned) so why then, go after the artifacts when you have someone who can make more? If this was just a lie (Can&#039;t confirm, just saying but there&#039;s no indication of this, I&#039;m just covering my bases here), then this is exactly what I mean by infuriating your viewers, trolling em too. Further more, The mansion is OWNED by these people and even try to KICK Hatena, her sis and co out of the mansion while trying to take away their artifacts in a real world way. &quot;We own this mansion, you must leave.&quot; Them learning they live in the mansion was known all along in case you were wondering, another plot hole...<br />
<br />
Further more, in one episode before this, Hatena is in danger, she is captured and her family and friends learn of this. What do they do? Get ready to rescue her but not before debating if her sis should come or not (There is a reason but still) and while that&#039;s been done before what REALLY was bad here and dumb is, until they see the state Hatena was in, they don&#039;t show the least bit of concern for her safety. Sure, the enemy who isn&#039;t family will not harm her, we should just take our sweet time while not being concerned for her safety at all *Rolls eyes* (That was sarcasm in case you couldn&#039;t tell) And the other dumb part comes once they make it to Hatena, you DON&#039;T place something on someone given the state they were in which is made worse thanks to Hatena&#039;s artifact yet this is brushed aside because, plot hole in the logic... (If you saw this episode you know exactly what I&#039;m referring to here)<br />
<br />
And so, the reason I dropped this anime at episode 8 despite it having a turning point which was more serious (And very laughable given it was even more plot holes and I just couldn&#039;t take it seriously) is because, I do not enjoy this anime, it makes me mad and despite it having a mere 3 episodes left (Side note: Its 4 episodes now, for some reason the 12th episode was delayed or added later and not listed on MAL as even existing till over a month later) I&#039;d rather spend that time writing this review to WARN YOU Reader-san, to STAY FAR AWAY from Hatena☆Illusion. This is also why I removed my original review made after the first 3 episodes were out because I did not feel it was helping anyone and was doing the opposite.<br />
<br />
And now ladies and gentlemen, we come to a close, the show mustn&#039;t go on any longer but I hope this review helps you. I give Hatena☆Illusion a rating of 4.0 out of 10.0. That&#039;s it for this review, I&#039;ll see you in my next review~<br />
<br />
Side Note:  I only use a number to rate anime and I do not use the words in MAL&#039;s rating score. E.g. a 4 is considered &quot;Decent&quot; to MAL, this is certainly not the case for this anime. Most anime I rate are 7.0 or above, just so you can compare how much I &quot;enjoyed&quot; this anime.
