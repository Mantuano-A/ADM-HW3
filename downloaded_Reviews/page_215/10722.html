The story topples even the greatest of literary works. William Shakesphere and Mark Train wish they&#039;d live to see this anime. It is about a young man named Edgy Yukiteru, who wishes to conquer the world after obtaining a Stand that allows him to control anything within an uncertain area. See how mighty Edgy is as his powers let him break out of any situation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220941">
        that is most convenient for the plot! Crucial plot elements like &quot;drama&quot; and &quot;tension&quot; shalt not exist in this grand adventure, for they are mere illusions created by humans. Big Order transcends our reality and is above such trivial things, and the great god Edgy cannot hope to be harmed by anything due to his awesome power.<br />
<br />
But, alas! Harsh trials await our dear Edgy, as he doesn&#039;t use his power in the most effective ways. Is it because he lacks intelligence? Heavens, no! One must not underestimate this seraph, for he is merely toying with his enemies and giving them the faintest chance of victory, allowing the intricate narrative to play its part. Such mighty foes lurk in the dark, with power over nuclear weapons and innocent hostages. Such cruelty! But that&#039;s not all! The entire world foolishly misunderstands Edgy&#039;s celestial presence as they blame him for the deaths of billions of people. With this, we are given an extraordinarily realistic representation of real people; it&#039;s as if the show were actually filmed live from a rally of the glorious Donald Trump! And even Edgy&#039;s friends are mysterious characters as he peacefully neglects to control them by force. Is there anyone he can trust!?<br />
<br />
Yea, Edgy does indeed have a loyal follower, his lone younger sister. A pure and innocent being, she plays a key role in the story as the motivation and love interest of our hero, for his order is dedicated to only her. Such a human relationship, it&#039;s as if the show were actually filmed live from a rally of the glorious Donald Trump! The adoration of his blessed imouto fills him with determination and motivates the audience to cheer on their beloved icon even more!<br />
<br />
See the intensity of the challenging duels between Order Users as they clash together; their gorgeous avatars dazzle the eyes of the audience, but only for a short time. While these battles appear to only last moments with few actions taking place, it is merely a sample of what lies hidden away. Our sinful beings are not worthy of witnessing the true battles of the gods, and such we are limited to quick brawls with ordinary tactics and simple abilities. Be grateful for what you have, mortal.<br />
<br />
Truly, no words can describe some of the bold details of the writing; I cannot name specifics, for that would be spoiling and therefore tarnishing the mystical plot, but you cannot prepare thy rear enough for them! Big Order is a shocking and surprising series with amazing dialogue and entertainingly absurd ideas that are sure to boggle your mind. When one thinks they know the secrets and intricate details of the world, they are greeted with new, astonishing discoveries. Such is the truth with Big Order.<br />
<br />
The cast is nothing short of brilliant. Edgy is truly an hero whose intellect and manliness is unmatched, as is depicted with the impregnation of Rei. His personality is locked away from all others--including us, the lesser audience. His lack of characteristics truly make him the perfect being. His short-lived accomplice, Yuno Gasai, is a murderous wench who seeks to destroy Edgy, but her attempts always end in failure, providing us with amusement. Only in Big Order shall you see menacing villains turned into comical relief! And the saintly Rei Ayanami is but an innocent wanderer in the story, but witnesses the excellence that is Edgy Yukiteru, and pledges loyalty to him for all eternity for small, simple reasons. May we all follow her example, for we too have small, simple reasons for our lives.<br />
<br />
Appropriately, Big Order is depicted through art that surpasses the fine works of Michael Angelo, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bob Ross, and so on. The holy Stands are gorgeously portrayed by fine computer-generated animation reminiscent of the year 2003, a golden age when shrubbery was leading a great country and Nickelodeon broadcasted amusing content. After all, if we are to go forward, we must go back. Studio Assread has once again proven to be the future of the anime industry. And no other anime has such breathtaking and unique character designs like Big Order does; they are masterfully crafted and gorgeous to watch. Some say they are “fanservice-y”, but that is merely a sin they have brought upon themselves for thinking such dirty things. It’s only natural for a lady with rock powers to have rock-hard nipples, and it is your duty to respect that. Shame on you. It’s no wonder why many viewers have reported sights of an Ultralight Beam covering much of their filthy screens; it is only visible to the eyes of sinners to prevent them from further descension. Should you repent, you may one day become capable of viewing the mature content like a responsible adult.<br />
<br />
Ah, the great sounds of jazz! An elegant series such as this has but the most charming of music pieces to accompany it. No matter the scene or situation, the power of brass trumpets and saxophones will sound triumphantly. The opening theme, performed by none other than the esteemed Babymetal, is an explosive tune that is sure to rock the audience, and the ending credits is a haunting, hallowing experience that leaves you craving another episode. But they cannot compare to the greatness of the jazzy soundtrack.<br />
<br />
...Oh, dear reader. How have you managed to read this much without rushing over to legally view this sanctifying experience!? Run along, my friend! Tell your friends and family about the good news, salvation is here! We have truly found perfection, and it is none other than the ten episodes of Big Order!

    Decent potential, miserable output. 1/10 Do not waste your time with this!<br />
<br />
This anime is a complete mess. The main chararacter is the most unrelatable unbelievably arrogant bratty annoying POS MC since Light Yagami (at least Light&#039;s ideals were not so incredibly base as doing his best Hitler impression to satisfy his sister-complex), the plot is just a constant stream of deus ex machinas, there&#039;s no sense of realism whatsoever (all the characters are one dimensional and their actionis/reactions make no sense), the theme has been butchered by unnecessary OPedness of the MC (due to lack of creative problem solving), and they are so inconsistent in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218120">
        trying to do everything that they don&#039;t succeed at anything - not humor, not dialogue, not emotion, not mystery, not psychological warfare, not cleverness,  not action, not magic, not character development, not dark themes, not light themes. There&#039;s just so much wrong with this anime. The mangaka should commit seppuku. This anime is a complete fail. <br />
<br />
If Sharknado is your favorite movie, then by all means, give this a try. But if not, stay away!

    Big Order is a mess. A real BAD mess. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen another anime with such bizarre execution, themes and ideas while also tripping over itself at every opportunity faster than the time grandma fell down the stairs. This show was so bad that I thought it was a joke or a satire of anime conventions. Boy, was I wrong. While, certainly, there were many parts of the anime I would classify as &quot;so bad it&#039;s good&quot;, by the end, the narrative became even more of a convoluted mess and all fun I had with the series quickly diminished. Hell, when I saw

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220945">
        the announcement for this show, I initially thought it was going to be a slice of life series about working in the fast-food industry. After learning that in fact, it was the same author as Mirai Nikki, I understood why it was such a big mess but I think this is far worse than Mirai Nikki in terms of writing, normally an author gets better over time, not the other way around.<br />
<br />
This doesn&#039;t help either that every character in Big Order looks like rejects from Mirai Nikki. To be perfectly fair this is expected to a certain extent since manga authors usually have a particular style or way of designing characters but the likeness of Nikki certainly felt more so reductive than innovative. <br />
<br />
Big Order&#039;s narrative begins with an extremely vague flying woman who goes around granting wishes to people, She eventually comes across the main character who informs her that he wishes to destroy the world since he was influenced by his favorite cartoon...the world was destroyed by a FUCKING cartoon. After the protagonist commits genocide, the narrative picks up ten years into the future (because fuck continuity) were we see the world has not been destroyed, and even after a massive calamity, society seems to have progressed enough to build another school. I certainly haven&#039;t lived through a disaster like the world being destroyed but I highly doubt a school or sometimes whole cities would still be running, but hey, this show doesn&#039;t care about its worldbuilding so why should I? The show shortly establishes that this woman, named Daisy, had been granting wishes to many other people too, who are thus given the label of &quot;orders&quot; and are hated by the remaining populace.<br />
<br />
Just a small tidbit if you&#039;d please excuse me, but if Daisy was granting random wishes to people, then why on earth didn&#039;t anyone wish for the world to be fixed or something? Was Eiji  (our genocide protagonist) the last person she ever granted a wish to? Anyway, Eiji is incredibly annoying. He is an edgy as fuck teenager and the world hates him, while also having a rather intimate relationship with his sister. Why? I don&#039;t know, incest is going to be in every bad show now? And it&#039;s not like it&#039;s subtle either. They literally have sex with each other. Neat. While on his way home from school one day, Eiji is attacked by a Yuno clone (minus everything that made Yuno a fun character). She vows vengeance on Eiji since his wish caused the great destruction which killed her parents. During this fight, he showcases his power which literally looks like a poor man&#039;s version of a stand from JoJo. In fact, every power is literally a JoJo stand except they&#039;re all CG and look like shit and none of the powers are ever developed or explained. <br />
<br />
Anyway, Eiji can control things within his &#039;domain&#039; and manipulate things within that space to do whatever he says...so not only is this show like JoJo, it&#039;s also like Code Geass, he even wants to take over the world in the name of peace like Lelouch. While Yuno-clone is in this domain, she is unable to kill Eiji but over the course of the show begins to fall in love with him which is the dumbest thing I&#039;ve ever heard because he kinda says that he will marry her or something...this makes no fucking sense.<br />
<br />
After deciding to take over the world for the sake of world peace and to protect his sister and is made king of some kind of organization or whatever... I don&#039;t fucking care anymore. Why should I care when the anime gives me no reason to. We&#039;re introduced to all these characters who are supposedly the strongest but they barely have any screen time and pretty much are useless<br />
<br />
The plot is all over the god damn place and nothing makes any sense what so ever. Things happen at random, all of the characters are stupid beyond belief. We rush through the plot at breakneck speed never allowing for any plot or character development at all. No character is likable in the slightest and no one is ever developed. For a while, the show could be pretty entertaining since it was so bad it was good. Such as in episode 4 when a nuke is dropped right above Eiji&#039;s head and he stops it his bare hands. Wouldn&#039;t it explode? Why didn&#039;t the people aim the nuke a few miles away from their location to ensure that it can&#039;t be stopped? Who fucking cares.<br />
<br />
The anime tries way too hard to be edgy featuring plenty of leg and arm amputations and some of the worst censoring I have seen in a long time for any kind of nudity. Don&#039;t you love scenes that are 90% white light? <br />
<br />
There were some parts that were just fucking dumb. Like the one scene in which Eiji touches the ears of the Miko character and she becomes pregnant. What the fuck.<br />
<br />
The powers are never explained and lack any originality. The characters are boring and badly written, there is crappy animation and bad CGI, dull script, extremely forced plot twists that make no sense near the end and combining that with one of the worst endings I have ever seen makes for one of the worst anime of this year.

    Before I begin my review, let me get it off my chest and say that I am not one of those elite posers or trolls who is quick to hop on the bandwagon and immediately dislike the show because the original creator was Sakae Esuno, the original artist and author of Mirai Nikki or Future Dairy (whichever you prefer.) <br />
<br />
Let me start with this, between Future Diary and Big order, with this series it&#039;s like characters that didn&#039;t make it into The future diary got their own spin-off thus Big order was born. Just watching the first episode, the  similarities with the characters and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220935">
        to a certain degree the story are of course obvious. Certain characters resemble, and to a certain extent act/behave almost the way characters in Future Diary did. In all honesty, it&#039;s like he made the same story twice but (Obviously) tweaked little things in the story, plot, etc to try to give Big order its own unique individuality. For the most part I think that it works out pretty well. I&#039;m not saying that Sakae is a bad writer, it&#039;s just that he needs to do a better job with making better distinctions with each of his works, that way it doesn&#039;t feel like the two shows are blending into each other. Unless of course he&#039;s doing this to make it seem like they take place in the same sort of universe however... we all (most of us) know how the universes in Future Dairy work out.. cough cough.  That aside, I could not establish any type of commitment to the story [for the most part.] I will certainly say that it is not Esuno&#039;s best work however, I am roughly around 86.7% convinced that he can do a better job with creating an engaging and intensely dramatic story-line [along with plot] that&#039;s not only fun to watch but also really keeps viewers like me satisfied and engaged with what&#039;s going on. To me it seems like he purposely adds, or &quot;tries too hard&quot; to keep his work &quot;dark&quot; while trying to add fear into the factor and it just wasn&#039;t working for me. I mean, [and I&#039;m going to try to stop bringing up the future dairy because again this is a different work] with the future dairy I was very satisfied with The story &amp; plot. It was full of drama and the studio, producers, and director did a great job of adding mystery and a bit of action parts to the story. Which kept me engaged for a majority of the time.  <br />
Big order really felt like (and I hate to use this word) but laziness, pure laziness. Now things did pick up for me after episode 5. To me, this is the point where the show finally start getting somewhat serious in both dialogue and starting drama. I cannot spoil anything but I loved the intense amount of dramatic battles, fights between Eiji and his squad. I was glad that things started to pick up in Big order. Because there are only 10 episodes, if things didn&#039;t pick up around episode 5-6 I probably would&#039;ve lost interest and dropped it. Il would probably had stuck to my guns and watched it anyway simply because once I start a show I make a commitment to see it through. Overall, I felt like dialogue between characters was dull, action scenes didn&#039;t really land a spark and it lacked an engaging story-line along with plot. I gave the 6.5 outta 10 because I didn&#039;t feel like Sakae had used his full potential.<br />
<br />
The animation, special effects, and CGI used during the show were pretty good however nothing major stands out too much to me. When I&#039;m watching battle scenes I often times felt like it was missing a certain charm.  Perhaps they lacked intensity &amp; replay value.  I was expecting, &quot;unless of course I missed some&quot; Easter eggs or references of the future dairy, I mean I saw the ball that Kami-Musubi had looked like the same one Tsubaki in Future dairy owned however, as far as I saw, that is the limit to how far Easter eggs go. Now character designs, the resemblances, I felt like at the very least the producers could have at least adjusted Eiji, Tairano, Daisy, Rin, and so many other characters original designs to look much different. This is because they stand out too much and look like the future dairy cast. They appear as cheesy, uninspired rip offs.  Sakae shouldn&#039;t draw Yukiteru and make him look more mature and call him &quot;Eiji.&quot; He shouldn&#039;t draw  Yuno make her look like a dolled up idol star and call her &quot;Daisy.&quot; More importantly he should not! and I mean should not! have taken Yuno&#039;s infamous &quot;Yandere archetype&quot; and Minene&#039;s cold, tough girl attitude and gave it to Kurenai I just think that lacks a bit of creativity. Overall, despite all of this I&#039;m still satisfied with the final results.<br />
<br />
I disliked all the characters. I don&#039;t know how much I can go into so I&#039;ll just put it bluntly. Big order has the most dullest, and lackluster characters I have seen in some time. Each character lacked their own unique individuality. As I mentioned many times before, the characters, for the most part are just copy and pasted from Mirai Nikki albeit with some changes. Character growth and development wasn&#039;t exciting because Eiji literally has an OP gift &quot;order.&quot; Although he does have this power he is often times beaten by other important characters but of course he cannot lose because you know, he&#039;s the main character. If I had to change anything from Esuno&#039;s work,  I would make characters more appealing in terms of personality, uniqueness and how they appeal to the viewers. Creativity and most importantly memorable characters in big order isn&#039;t possible for me because again, all I saw was laziness.  Overall I was beyond disappointed with the characters and this is the first time! This is perhaps the first and hopefully the last time I have to watch a show with a cast full of bad characters.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack was pretty good but no too impressive. Music is not as powerful and dramatic as the future diary soundtrack however, there are  still has a few good songs here to hear playing in the background here and there. Voice actors were pretty good so I don&#039;t have much to complain about in that department. Overall I didn&#039;t care too much about the soundtrack.<br />
<br />
Let me just say that I wasn&#039;t exactly too fond of what I watched. I&#039;m not going to say that it was completely bad because, as I mentioned earlier, the show does deliver lots of great moments however, in the long run, I felt like it was wasted potential. Overall I think it needed a lot of work in story and especially the characters department.

    *spoilers for Big Order*<br />
<br />
Big Order is an enigma. It&#039;s beyond our comprehension, in the worst way possible. It throws you for all kinds of loops in the dumbest, more surreal ways imaginable, thinking that&#039;s it&#039;s a clever, emotional, deep, and truly thought-provoking being when in reality, it&#039;s a sloppy, horrifically told mess. Trying to really understand everything about it is to succumb to a Lovecraftian horror that will destroy your mind and soul since it actually manages to be both convoluted in all the potentially interesting and deep ways while fucking it all up and being convoluted the wrong ways. It doesn&#039;t answer all the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249467">
        right questions we are left with, and it sometimes answers them in ways that make things worse. Hell, it doesn&#039;t even understand the revolting implications of some of its characters actions, so how the hell can it expect to understand the major plot it has created?<br />
<br />
It&#039;s actually futile to try to understand this anime since it doesn&#039;t even understand itself that well. It&#039;s like it&#039;s final antagonist, trying to delve deep into something it was never gonna truly get, making detrimentally wrong decisions, and losing sight of what it tried to do as it went and tried to one-up itself in &quot;craftiness&quot; and &quot;mind-bending twists&quot;. It knows what it&#039;s trying to be, but that it&#039;s trying to be is something it cannot handle, which is truly fitting given that many of its characters suffer that exact same fate. So, just how badly did Big Order implode in on itself? Or rather, just what happened to make it suffer that fate? Well, let&#039;s find out, shall we?<br />
<br />
Basically, 10 years ago, Eiji made a wish that ended up destroying the world, add that wish was to dominate it for world peace. Now, you&#039;re asking why didn&#039;t he say &quot;I want world peace&quot;? The thing is, it wasn&#039;t his actual wish, it was his sister&#039;s. I know I&#039;m jumping the gun but I need to tackle this early. The flashbacks make it seem like she&#039;s a girl who can comprehend full conversations and the state of our worlds as well as empathy by then we learn she was only 3, making this make little sense since actual 3 year olds don&#039;t do any of that. I know this because the flashback specifically states 10 years ago, as well as the fact that in the final episode, she turns 14 soon after the major events of the final episode. Now, basically, the plot tries to one up itself in terms of stringing its MC along for all sorts of twists, turns, betrayals, etc., so let&#039;s tackle some of them, as well as a few other moments and see what went wrong, shall we? After all, it&#039;s hard to really describe the plot well given how wrecked it is, but we can attack it&#039;s logic and see why the story falters, in sort of a rapid fire kind of fashion, though this isn&#039;t my usual formula.<br />
<br />
When Kurenai Rin stabs Eiji&#039;s sister (Sena) in the shoulder with a sword and she bleeds horribly, you&#039;d expect that when Eiji reaches her far more than 10 minutes later given how the episode presents itself, that she would actually be dead from blood loss. Eiji takes down two heavily armed and protected dudes by going ham with a sign (that was never shown), so yeah, that&#039;s dumb. If Rin wanted to finish off Eiji herself, she definitely shouldn&#039;t have ordered her men to riddle him with bullets (regardless of the fact that it didn&#039;t even work). When Eiji effectively puts her in his dominion, or rather, when he uses his order to block the shots before he uses his dominion order, she, for no reason, heals Sena and he never even ordered to. She wants to know why, and neither she nor we get a definite answer since we never hear him tell her to heal his sister. Barring the stuff I listed above that ultimately is explained away by the big Sena twist, this is basically all of the really crazy illogical moments from episode 1. Keep that in mind. Also at the end of the episode, Eiji uses his Order avatar to wrap Rin and given the audio and the way the episode fades to black for the credits, it basically sounds like he basically forced her into tentacle rape, and I&#039;m not sure if they really wanted that implication or maybe they did it as a joke. Dunno.<br />
<br />
Characters betray each other for no good reason. I mean, Franc betrays the group in episode 7 for no adequately explained reason only to do a face turn, only to do another heel turn in the finale. Characters also try to outsmart each other all the time, to varying and often pathetic degrees of success in terms of making any sense, like how in episode 4, one of the 10 members working for them was pretending to work for the enemy by giving the enemy heavily compromising information that jeopardizes his side&#039;s own plans to nearly getting their pawn (Eiji) killed (even though it easing their own order), or well, everything in one ginormous sequence in episode 7 that amounts to the two leaders trying to outwit each other until they are betrayed by one of their own (Rin for the bad guys and Franc for the &quot;good guys&quot;, except Rin&#039;s was a part of the bad guys&#039; plan). It&#039;s like the writer(s) decided to try to make the story one-up itself in terms of convoluted schemes of planning around plans and adding in betrayals regardless of whether or not it can be easy enough to remotely follow or if it all makes sense.<br />
<br />
Characters also don&#039;t use their OP AF powers on ways that actually make good sense in their situations. There are a few notable accounts of this. Episode 3: Eiji has the Group of 10 (what a boring name) under his dominion and claims to be in control (though that&#039;s what they want), and he doesn&#039;t even do anything to bind them under his will aside from &quot;don&#039;t leave my domain&quot;. If he really wanted to be in control, he should&#039;ve tried to make them actually submit to his power and decisions via his dominion instead of saying &quot;you&#039;re in my dominion&quot; and expecting them to just follow him and not get him entangled in their scenes. Episode 6: A swordsman has an inter-dimensional sword that can slash between dimensions, and when he has Eiji and Iyo in his sights (as well as a now useless colleague and Kuroko (the Miko of vitality and couples in episode 6 who is gorgeous AF), he swipes vertically to kill the latter two. Even if it&#039;s revealed that Eiji needed to be alive for his father (the main antagonist), did he swordsman know that? Why not swipe vertically to kill everyone, or if he knew that he needed Eiji alive, why not depends diagonally to try to cut off a limb to make him more susceptible to capture? Episode 10: Sena Wishes dominion over the world for world peace. Even if she was basically 3 at the time, why didn&#039;t she just wish for world peace? So that the plot could happen? There had to have been better ways of making this work, like maybe trying to justify why she didn&#039;t (like maybe she wanted to emulate the world domination aspect of her idol book comic character, or maybe she didn&#039;t think it through at all). Instead, she wished for world domination and couldn&#039;t handle the power so it fucked over the world. Also, when Eiji wished to shoulder all of the damage she did with that wish, how does it equate to him taking her power, messing both his and her memories, and basically suppressing and replacing their memories of their father? Bah! Moving on!<br />
<br />
As I said, this show doesn&#039;t understand any of the downright horrible implications of some of the characters&#039; actions. Let&#039;s run down the list, shall we? The Group of Ten basically leaked info to basically ruin a high schooler&#039;s life by turning the world against him and manipulating him into their schemes just so they can kill his father and stop his plans, even knowing that both he and his sister were crucial in his plot. That literally makes no sense and the fact that they expect him to go along with it is especially galling. They basically made him a global pariah worse than Adolf Hitler, so no shit he often has a hard time of complying! In episode 4, Eiji and Sena are in bed with him on top in a very sexual position, and then we next see all of their clothes on the floor and an open shower curtain. Regardless of the fact that we only blatantly know that they&#039;re just showering together, it&#039;s very creepy for a teenage boy to shower with his not much younger sister at their ages. Also, given all of this context, you can imagine that the implications of actual incest run rampant here, which is just not good. Hell, the fact that she kisses him in the final episode of the anime (without any context to blatantly suggest otherwise), it&#039;s basically confirmed that she was wanting to have incest with him, or at least heavy implications make it come off that way.<br />
<br />
Time for this last example to really sell my point home. In episode 9, Iyo has Eiji handcuffed to a bed with just his shirt off and they take off their clothes, but he is trying to decline sex in favor of current matters, and given the context of what&#039;s going on, it&#039;s implied from the anime that she was already sorta having sex anyway thanks to Eiji&#039;s line about her going any deeper, and again, he never actually consented and she was still trying to have sex with him. Does that sound like rape to you, because it does to me. Don&#039;t try to give me some bullshit spheal about &quot;women can&#039;t rape men, that&#039;s not how that works; at worst, it&#039;s only physically possible for it to be sexual harassment or assault&quot; since she had him chained up to something without his knowledge or consent and is trying to have (and given the anime&#039;s context, likely in the middle of having) sex regardless of his declining (likely because he&#039;d rather save it for a time where his sister wasn&#039;t in danger) so that counts as attempted rape, even if none of the characters realize it as such. Do you see what I mean by horrid implications that no character seems to take into consideration regarding their actions!<br />
<br />
Before we get to the real meat of the convoluted nature of the series, let’s also smash a few weird ass scenes apart since, well, this anime is beyond strange. The ultimate example of this is the beginning of episode 5. Kagekiyo basically grabs and fondles the tits of Rin, Mari (the chick with the glasses and lasers), and Iyo, all while basically having an orgasm over their “twin peaks” when she fondles them enough, getting her ass kicked every time, brushing it off like it&#039;s nothing before moving to her next target, and not learning not to be such a perv to other women. All this scene adds is time and discomfort. I&#039;ve already talked about the episode 4 scene that really hints at incest, so I&#039;ll tackle one more scene: Eiji gets an arm and a leg cut off in episode 8, and the moment he uses the Eiji x Iyo fusion of his Order avatar, he can suddenly manipulate his limbs to attach to him for no reason other than asspulls since it was never shown to be able to do that. I know orders defy conventional logic, but they only do that via the user’s ordered actions, not by nature of their existence.<br />
<br />
There’s this whole thing about how the people hate Order users because they hate Eiji for what happened to the world. Problem is, the way they go about this is hamfisted. Civilians in this show are absurdly hateful and are portrayed in this vicious, uncivilized, basically evil light. Also, you know, it seems like none of them try to move on from their grief and put it past them in order to try to live a better life. I get that their families were killed and their lives were inverted but everyone comes off as insanely hateful for the sake of it. I&#039;ll address the final thing that makes the civilians on the show horrible when we get there.<br />

Yeah, time to delve into the big plot of the second half. Given that the anime ended a few months before the manga did, I can only assume that all of this, or at least a good chunk of it (namely the final episode or 3) was filler, though even with the research I did (without reading the manga or knowing someone who has) I cannot prove this. Well, it turns out that the Group of 10 were initially meant to track down and kill Genai, Eiji’s father, and you can refer to a few paragraphs ago on why that is horse shit when taking everything into account. Also, the bad guys are tracking down and trying to kill mikos. Apparently it&#039;s because they are involved in this pentagram involved with the gate to this mental world that he wants to unlock because it was Sena that originally did so, though she couldn&#039;t control it, causing the world to be ravaged, apparently so that he can create an infinite amount of parallel universes, including ones where Sena’s wish was granted and she was happy and world peace, even if it means forsaking the universe that we are currently seeing our characters in and everyone storms the place and betrayals and Eiji denouncing his goal and getting stabbed by his sister and then fusing orders and kicking ass and winning and God shows up and the world is now good and now that means everyone sees Eiji as a hero which makes no sense given how much whiplash that is with how hateful they were and good ending and blah blah blah! I&#039;m not even gonna question any more aspects of the finale like the memory parasite robots or anything since my mind is fried beyond belief. <br />
<br />
Another crucial problem is that very few of these characters have any remotely interesting personality to speak of, so I&#039;ll prattle a lot of them off quick. The Group of 10 are mostly useless, with only a few of them being relevant like the leader, Mari, Iyo, and 3 other dudes who only do one specific thing like flying, teleporting, and punching, and some of them are so useless that they don&#039;t even have any real screen time, and of course, each of them is basically one note and dull, even the fun-loving flying and punching dudes are just meh, and are just there for deus ex machinas. Even the main character Eiji is a boring teen protagonist who is basically Lelouch if he had the personality of an ordinary school protagonist, including his devotion to making his sister happy. Rin is just an annoying chick who always wants to kill Eiji until one final sappy scene where she motivates him in the final episode. Also, yeah, different hair color aside, her design is strikingly similar to that of Yuno from Mirai Nikki. Kagekiyo is just a vengeful and quirky person who also happens to be a total perv (and probably either bi or lesbian given the twin peaks scene in episode 5), and is basically irrelevant aside from episodes 3 and 4, and one scene in the finale. Also, Sena is basically a worse Nunnally who sorta is in love with her brother and is the one  actually responsible for the world ending. Plus, her heel turn in episode 9 was abominable.<br />
<br />
Now into the full-blown antagonists. I don&#039;t even think most of them have names aside from Jyuubei (the sword guy) and Genai (the main antagonist). Aside from Genso, there nothing but generic, borderline personality-less baddies. It&#039;s sad when Fairy Tail can come up with tons of evil teams (Oración Seis, Tartarus, Grimoire Heart, Phantom Lord, and a good few others) that have each and every character have some kind of defined personality with some of them getting sort of fleshed out, and in rarer cases, even developed and yet no one here has a truly concrete personality aside from the most generic templates of a personality. Genai has this weird obsession with flowers and the series tries its damnedest to make him a sympathetic scientist father whose plans drove him insane and ruined everything for everyone, but when they can&#039;t even do a good job with his backstory, the backstory about him for one of the characters, or even how despite supposedly  caring so much for Eiji and Sena he never actually shows care after the major incident (he never looks for them orthopedic to get others to do the same, and he doesn&#039;t care how badly their hurt as long as they&#039;re alive and useful), even he misses the mark. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t even really begin to describe Daisy in any way that isn&#039;t how much teasing he does to Eiji about his powers and memories. She is as much of an enigma as the show itself, and I don&#039;t think it was as intentional as you might think since we know nothing about her backstory other than the fact that she was used as the vessel of an experiment that caused her to become some kind of floating person that hands out Orders. We never really see that from her perspective, nor does she really have anything concrete about her aside from her great looks and how much she teases Eiji about pertinent information. What was she like before? Did the change affect her in any way? Why did she get a job as a waitress at the end of the series! Despite being one of the more prominent characters in the series, I probably have the least feel for what kind of personality she has. Also, the only Miko we get to know aside from Iyo is Kuroko, a beautiful lady who has perfect vitality and spend her days basically forging couples, and it&#039;s funny to hear her get annoyed when Eiji and Iyo don&#039;t understand one another and have awkward moments despite them being obviously the pair that will be a couple, though she doesn&#039;t really get to do much since she was killed off unceremoniously. She was, all things considered, the best character in the show, and when a basically one-off character is the best character in your entire series, that&#039;s pretty pathetic.<br />
<br />
The character art...is inconsistent. Sometimes it looks amazing, with all sorts of wonderful shading to complement the (mostly) wonderful (albeit sometimes borderline copy paste) character designs, and other times, it looks flat with characters having none of that shading. It would&#039;ve been great if Studio Asread were capable of doing what Studio Wit did with Kabaneri and managed to have the perfect shading all the time instead of only sometimes, but hey, it&#039;s better than having the flat looking moments for the characters all the time. Only one design looks terrible and that&#039;s Kagekiyo’s, especially with those absurdly pointy nipples that stick out from her g-string big time. The actual animation isn&#039;t spectacular but ultimately competent, despite a few laughable moments like the way Eiji turns/slides in episode 2 (I bet you know the scene I&#039;m talking about). The censorship is pretty terrible though, but not as horrid as the usual black bars or even black circles. The kaleidoscope imagery looked nice though, even if the series doesn&#039;t really do well in terms of having contrasting light and shadow in the same frame. Also, the CGI is pretty terrible, not just with the avatars, but especially with the nukes in episode 4 and just how prevalent the CGI is, also bogs it all down, especially since it doesn&#039;t work well with the aesthetic of the series, nor does it look good on its own. I do at least like when the imagery gets really triply like with the world destruction and with most of the final episode.<br />
<br />
The OP “Disorder” by Yousei Teikoku...is certainly fitting in terms of its chaotic nature and how much of a mess Big Order is. I don&#039;t particularly like it, especially in comparison to some of her other songs like Mirai Nikki OP 1 or Deus’s character song. The ED “Kobore Sekai Oware (毀レ世カイ終ワレ)&quot; by Aki Hata is...fascinating. Both somewhat unnerving and simultaneously alluring. I really like it, more so than any other piece of music in the series. The Actual OST is somewhat ok but is really unfitting (with tons of jazz pieces that sound like they’d be playing at certain parts of a fun spy series instead of an anime like this), and some of them, especially the track “Dominate” are played over and over again and it gets annoying since none of the tracks (aside from track 7) are particularly good. It&#039;s not that they&#039;re bad, it&#039;s that they are overused and ill-fitting most of <br />
<br />
For a while now, Big Order was easily the most enjoyable train wreck I had ever seen. It&#039;s decisions were so baffling and out of left field that I couldn&#039;t help but laugh my ass off constantly throughout the first 6 episodes. It wasn&#039;t enjoyable in the conventional sense and the episodes got increasingly aggravating, but the last 4 episode felt more aggravating than funny bad, mainly due to how it grew stale and unbelievably convoluted, and the fact that it tried harder than ever to be serious and heartfelt rather than crazy and fun in terms of what it was trying to do. I don&#039;t actually hate the ending, partially because I couldn&#039;t even care anymore and my mind was crashing like Hindenburg or the Titanic, and blowing up like a Megaman boss. I was more distraught by its failures than infuriated or poised to laugh at them in the last 4 episodes, especially the finale. Plus, certain implications and true ramifications of situations really broke me at times. Nonetheless, I can say that for most part, I consider it to be the first truly effective schlock title I have ever seen, in the way that I laughed my ass off constantly throughout a majority of the run, for whatever that&#039;s worth.<br />
<br />
Big Order is an absolute mess. It&#039;s not just convoluted, but stupidly confusing and confusingly stupid. It becomes legitimately hard to grasp as to what is actually wrong with the story and what is just convoluted and/or absurd but intentional and not harmful. As your mind tries to parse all that, as well as the awful CGI and constant kaleidoscope imagery, as well as the unfitting music that makes you speculate as to what kind of series the OST would better suit, it all moves along at breakneck speeds. It&#039;s mentally taxing for sure, and not even mostly good character art, a few good songs, or even kaleidoscope imagery can remotely salvage that. You actively need to be mentally prepared to sit through this show or you will be left in the dust worse than any unprepared schmuck watching episode 20 of Ergo Proxy, which is an actually good anime that comes off as very convoluted at times. Big Order is a big pile ‘o shit and it deserves its dismal rating. It&#039;s sort of fascinating in a way if you’re capable of keeping up somewhat with the absurd narrative and decisions of the show, which is probably its biggest strength despite being fully comprised of the show’s fatal flaws. Only watch this if you&#039;re an expert at ripping bad anime to shreds. Everyone else, spare your brain cells. With all that said, I bid you adieu.

    You know how some jokes are so damn bad that you simply have to laugh at them for their &quot;badness&quot; ? Well Big Order is the embodiment of bad jokes in the form of anime. You either love it or hate it. <br />
<br />
I went in with zero expectations end the first episode delivered. Every episode was a trainwreck after trainwreck and I LOVED it. Nothing more to say, the story was shallow as could be and I got maximum enjoment out of it and at the end of the day that&#039;s what watching anime is all about. How much you enjoyed it.

I give this shit a 0 out of 10<br />
This anime is shit, don&#039;t bother with it, if you like Future Dairies and you want something similar then this show is a big waste of time, the MC is an idiot who forgot that he has a brain apparently, all the characters especially the girls are boring and uninteresting, not to mention how provocative they are, I mean, if you&#039;re looking for boobs then watch some hentai or whatever, the story is a fucking mess, it&#039;s inconsistent, illogical, ridiculous, and sometimes hilariously bad.<br />
<br />
I like:<br />
Nothing really, even the music is bad and unexciting.<br />
<br />
I hate:<br />
Pretty much everything.

    Warning this article may contain spoiler<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know why people often give this anime  score 1 out of 10, but this anime is not as bad as it look. Not bad as Divine Gate which is very disappointing. <br />
<br />
Big Order may seems like Mirai Nikki trying to do Code Geass because the character have special power to order someone like Code Geass and the design is similar from Mirai Nikki. But that actually make things interesting, it looks like a spin off.<br />
<br />
Story is 7, because the first few episode is not very original but there are lots of plot twist along the way even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221484">
        at episode 10, you cannot expect what will happen next. <br />
<br />
Art is 8, I can&#039;t complain enough because its great, the design is like Mirai Nikki with some awesome CG animation.<br />
<br />
Sound is 7, because there is awesome opening by Yousei Teikoku which takes me back dreaming about Mirai Nikki. But the ending is horrible and so creepy.<br />
<br />
(Major spoiler coming through) <br />
Character is 6, because I admit it that the character development is not very good maybe because of the mind erasing and brain washing (spoiler from episode 10)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment is 8, because there are many mind blowing scene including fan service and weird-nuts things like getting pregnant when someone touch the bunny ears hahaha (spoiler from episode 3) <br />
<br />
Overall is 9, the conclusion is Big Order is not bad and not very good also, so I&#039;m just hopping more people on MAL will rate it 7 or 6 instead of 1 or 2. <br />
<br />

    What is a &quot;Big Order.&quot; I often find myself asking this, but according to the show a big order is the manifestation of a persons needs or wants to come to come true, however is this anime really as skin-deep as it pretends to be? When starting this masterpiece you are introduced to some quirky characters, but what I told you that none of this matters because this happens to be the worlds longest BURGER KING commercial to ever be recorded. A sane person would be asking himself &quot;how does this show pertain to burger king?&quot; Well that&#039;s easy to answer, the main characters &quot;Big

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222999">
        Order&quot; is to literally have it his way which is the slogan the company introduced in early as the 1980s. It doesn&#039;t just end there with their famous slogan because the main character never shuts up about having it his way when it comes to women or even the world. In the end all I have to say is 10/10 had it my way

    WARNING: This review contains some spoilers for this masterpiece known as Big Order.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m fully confident to say that Big Order is the most misunderstood anime ever released, the fact that it has such a low score everywhere is truly baffling to me.<br />
<br />
Now wait, calm down. Drop those stones you&#039;re holding there and hear me out for a bit! I too once thought Big Order was a shitshow, especially because its author is the same fella who wrote that ungodly abomination called Mirai Nikki, and Big Order was full of random bullshit just like the previous series, which actually makes me question why Mirai Nikki has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295217">
        a higher score than this when both are essentially terribly-written trainwrecks that fail at every single thing they try to do... Or is it really how things are? Well, for Mirai Nikki that&#039;s definitely the case, but Big Order finally clicked with me on rewatch and I realized that the series is actually a lot smarter than most people think, because unlike Mirai Nikki, it actually treats its absurdly dumb plot points and twists like absurdly dumb plot points and twists! Big Order doesn&#039;t try to paint itself as some kind of brilliant 2deep4u work of art like Mirai Nikki does, it&#039;s actually quite the opposite: When you&#039;re watching it and say &quot;wow that&#039;s fucking ridiculous&quot;, Big Order turns to you and says &quot;I KNOW RIGHT?&quot; as it pulls another unbelievable twist right out of its ass in a glorious never-ending show of ingeniously crafted shitstorms. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s almost like Sakae Esuno is actually aware of how terrible Mirai Nikki was and decided to make Big Order into a parody of his previous work, laughing at himself for actually writing that garbage without the smallest bit of self-awareness, and maybe even laughing at people who actually think Mirai Nikki is a good series without being ironic about it. Yes, my friends, Sakae Esuno incorporated shitposting into anime and manga before it became a popular thing to do nowadays with shows like Pop Team Epic, Berserk 2016 and Darling in the FranXX. I haven&#039;t read the Big Order manga, but the anime adaptation even adds to the shitposting by having a soundtrack that couldn&#039;t be any less out-of-place with &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;dark&quot; scenes playing out as some bouncy jazz is playing on the background, it&#039;s clearly a deliberate move on the director and/or the composer for this anime, they&#039;re well aware of the true nature of Big Order and were happy to play along with Sakae Esuno&#039;s joke. I like to think that there&#039;s a bunch of ninjas who are always playing jazz while hiding themselves somewhere in the scenery, you&#039;ll never see them, but you certainly know they&#039;re around, and the characters in the series may also know of that, but they choose to ignore the background noise because there&#039;s always too much going on.<br />
<br />
Do you doubt that Big Order is a spoof of Mirai Nikki, and maybe even some other terribly-written anime? Alright then, explain to me why the protagonist Eiji and one of the girls in his ever-growing harem, Rin, have such a strong similarity with Yukiteru and Yuno from Mirai Nikki in their character designs! Is it because Esuno can only draw those types of characters and nothing more? Of course not, his other manga seems to have fairly distinct character designs, so why would he replicate characters from Mirai Nikki specifically for this particular series? I rest my case. But relax, just because these characters look like Yukiteru and Yuno, doesn&#039;t mean that they&#039;re the same, Eiji shows more balls in one episode of Big Order than Yukiteru shows in the entirety of Mirai Nikki for once, and Rin isn&#039;t really a yandere who wants to keep everyone away from Eiji&#039;s cock, in fact she actually hates him and wants him dead for most of the story, obviously because Esuno wants them to be the anti-Yukiteru and Yuno as part of the joke. The basic premise of the story is that there&#039;s a bunch of people known as Orders who have Stands with unique abilities each, because no shitposting anime would be fully realized without a JoJo reference, and Eiji is one of those people, he also apparently made some kind of fucked-up wish that caused the apocalypse and people hate him a little bit because of that, but he doesn&#039;t give a shit, he&#039;s got a cute little imouto called Sena who has AIDS and will die in a few months, but bigger than her disease is her lust for some onii-sama D, so he&#039;s just fine. However, it all changes when Rin tries to kill Eiji, which leads him to re-awakening his Stand power, which happens to be the Geass of Absolute Obedience! Thus, Eiji forces Rin to marry him and proceeds to legally rape her with his stand&#039;s pointy tentacles as the screen fades to black and some smooth jazz plays on the background.<br />
<br />
After that, Eiji becomes buddies with a bunch of other people who are also Orders and want to take over the world, but most of them don&#039;t really matter much aside from the bunny girl called Iyo who gets pregnant because Eiji touches her ribbon... Yes, she says that anyone who touches her ribbon which acts like bunny ears will impregnate her... This actually fucking happens! They take her to a nearby hospital, the nurse says a baby is coming out and later they actually have a discussion about pregnancy and raising kids. How in the world can anyone actually think this was meant to be taken seriously? The show is obviously taking the piss, you&#039;re supposed to laugh at how absurd this set-up for a &quot;romance&quot; subplot is and be on the edge of your seat for whatever the hell the series will want to throw at you next, and I assure that you won&#039;t be disappointed. I don&#039;t even want to spoil much of the plot, Big Order such an unpredictable beast that I could be ruining the experience if I spill out too much, and for the record, I showed this series to a friend of mine without letting her know much of what it&#039;s like, and she laughed her ass off from beginning to end, which is how we are all meant to react to it.<br />
<br />
By the way, the opening is pretty neat, yeah.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the only complaint I have about Big Order is the fact that it&#039;s only 10 episodes long, but... Oh God, it&#039;s 10 episodes of pure, unadulterated hilarity.

    Well, I picked up this show through the suggestion of a YouTuber whom I will not name. They made this series out to be epic, similar to Mirai Nikki (in a good way), and have a Yuno Gasai type girl.<br />
<br />
Right now, I&#039;m telling you to ignore this series entirely. You should not watch it under any circumstances unless you don&#039;t care about a story, character goals, premis, or anything else, making sense! Think of how Mirai Nikki, towards the end, had plot holes. This show is plot holes from start to finish. The only reason I didn&#039;t drop it after the first two episodes was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220971">
        because &quot;It&#039;s only 10 episodes, might as well add to my completed list, eh?&quot;. And, I will tell you that, yes I&#039;m pleased that I&#039;ve completed another show, but I&#039;m enraged with the ending to this shit fest.<br />
<br />
The only reputable thing about this garbage pile was its art, it&#039;s good art. &#039;kay? <br />
<br />
That&#039;s all I have to say, I&#039;m happy my life was wasted

    Unless you&#039;ve been living under a rock in recent years, you&#039;ve at least heard of the 2011 anime Mirai Nikki, known as Future Diary in English. Its one of the most popular anime of the last few years, though its reception is very mixed, with some people loving it and others flat-out despising it. A few years after it finished, another series by that series&#039; mangaka was announced to get an anime adaptation for the Spring 2016 season. That series, of course, being Big Order. While opinions on Mirai Nikki are rather split, most can agree with something about Big Order. Its trash.<br />
<br />
The series revolves

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221067">
        around the concept of the aptly named &quot;Orders&quot;, which are powers that originate via one&#039;s own wishes. Our story primarily focuses on Hoshimiya Eiji, a boy who supposedly caused an apocalypse that wiped out most of the population. As a result of this, he&#039;s despised by pretty much everyone, even so far as to get an assassin hired solely for killing him and him alone. Eiji now is on the run and has to save his sister, who is suffering from an illness likely to kill her in a few months. Well, that&#039;s what the story SUPPOSEDLY is. In actuality, the plot of Big Order is a huge pile of nonsense. The series can&#039;t decide on if it wants to be serious or silly. One of the biggest examples of this is when Eiji makes a miko pregnant but touching her bunny ears of all things during a major chase sequence (just roll with it), causing her belly to instantly swell up. Now, that may SEEM like a big plot point, but they decide to pretty much throw the idea away immediately in the next episode, pretty much making the supposed pregnancy subplot a complete waste of time. This is also one of those shows that thinks that shoving tits and ass into your story automatically redeems it, which it really doesn&#039;t. Some plot elements also feel like they&#039;re made up on the spot (and not even foreshadowed) solely to create Deus Ex Machinas. Most of the few things in this show that AREN&#039;T incomprehensible are overall dull and feel like they were lazily copied from other manga/anime. (Such as how the Orders have an uncanny resemblance to the Stands from Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure) Lastly, the pacing is so ridiculously fast that you have no idea on what&#039;s even going on. This is not helped by the atrocious world-building, or lack there of. In addition to having nothing in this world explained, there are some major inconsistencies. For instance, this is apparently a post-apocalyptic setting, but somehow, news buildings and schools survive because plot convenience. How lovely.<br />
<br />
Big Order&#039;s characters suffer from being both bland and unlikable. Eiji is the stereotypical edgy and obnoxiously loud shounen protagonist with some siscon thrown in for good measure (but its not incest cause they&#039;re not blood-related hurr durr (and yes, this IS something in the actual show)). Rin I guess is supposed to be a Yandere, but she lacks the charm of other characters of her type, and only acts according to the plot regardless of whether it fits her character, resulting in a blank slate basically. Sena is Eiji&#039;s blood-unrelated sister, and who we are supposed to sympathize for because she&#039;s cute and nothing more; even getting asspats by her brother even when she turns out to be a part of one of the major conflicts. The rest of the cast is so forgettable that I don&#039;t even remember their names. And considering that there&#039;s a lot of them, that&#039;s pretty bad. We&#039;re just introduced to them suddenly and the audience can&#039;t even feel to have a grasp of who they are (their actions make them come off as unmemorable at best); and at most they just serve as plot devices. They attempt to build romantic relationships, but the characters have no chemistry whatsoever so you can&#039;t feel invested in any of the romances present.<br />
<br />
Production wise I suppose it looks decent. There are several neat-looking effects used within each episode, though at times they feel sloppily done (particularly in the last episode). The OST, on the other hand, is generally cheesy 80&#039;s pop and doesn&#039;t even remotely fit in with the designated scenes, and as such, it kills any tension those scenes might&#039;ve had.<br />
<br />
The only thing big about Big Order is that it&#039;s a big mess. With a shoddily put together story, a dull cast of characters, and sheer laziness through out, Big Order offers nothing to the table, and as such, I suggest avoiding it like the plague. Now, there is something that may make Big Order somewhat recommendable. Its a great show to laugh at. Even then, its outclassed in that aspect even within its own season. Take Mayoiga, a series that provides the same unintentional hilarity, but at least it&#039;s made by staff who want to have fun first and foremost, even if it&#039;s not to everyone&#039;s liking. Not saying that Mayoiga&#039;s even remotely a good show unironically, but at least it&#039;s not this.

    I&#039;m just going to skip the foreplay and get my opinion out of the way: yes, Big Order is shit. The anime community and their family members who only know about Japanese cartoons through the posters on the wall have already declared it as shit from the moment the first episode aired, and the series quickly became known as one of the worst anime of all-time around the episode when a nuclear bomb was halted by a teenager boy&#039;s open palm. And whilst I never really care about popular word because I am a lonely hermit who refuses to join in &quot;best girl&quot; conversations for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review225269">
        fear of catching AIDS (Anime Is Da Shit), trying to defend Big Order is like trying to defend Bill Cosby. No matter what side you&#039;re on or what result comes out of this trail, the fact remains that the subject in question isn&#039;t going to win. Although Big Order did get licensed by Crunchyroll for a DVD release, so maybe that analogy is weaker than I already thought it was.<br />
<br />
Not quite sure where this show&#039;s massive hate base came from - at least, not compared to every other boring, inconsequential, and downright awful anime of which we get at least ten of every season - but I will say that if the parents in The Monkey&#039;s Paw had actually seen their kid, he&#039;d probably look like a visual representation of this series&#039; technicals. For starters, whenever something titillating happens in this show, there&#039;s always a bright flash of light that makes it look the images had been caught on fire prior to airing and the production team decided to just air it anyways because they made a deal with Satan and he&#039;s very stingy regarding when he wants his animu. Apparently, Satan isn&#039;t so stingy regarding whether he can actually see the underage boobage or what&#039;s actually happening in general, because the fire engulfed like 90% of the frames whenever a scene happens in order to make pre-pubescent boys experience their first erection, and since Big Order is a schlock anime, you&#039;re going to be seeing quite a bit of damaged footage by the time it finishes. You&#039;ll also notice watching the show that the violent images in this series were reportedly evacuated from the fire before it got too big, but because they&#039;re directed with about as much enthusiasm as a USA police officer has for a black person&#039;s safety and animated with a budget of three nickels, I speak no hyperbole when I say that a bunch of stick figures duking it out would have been more exciting to watch.<br />
<br />
And a lot has already been said about the sound mixing and choice of music, which is so utterly mismatched regarding what&#039;s going on that you could have put on one of those never-ending loop videos featuring a Rick Astley song and it would have blended in just as well. I wasn&#039;t really paying attention to it because the show aired on the same day as four other anime I kept up with and I mostly played video games when going through the boring half of that output just to keep myself from falling asleep, but the fact that I can&#039;t remember a single tune doesn&#039;t speak well for the composer of that shit. But of course, what else can you expect from asread? You know asread, right? The guys who gave us Shuffle, and then gave us Shuffle again? Can you imagine the censorship in that show if aired today? Depending on who you are, you&#039;ll either get more pissed off at the series than you already are now or laugh like a hyena because your mind has broken to the point that you can&#039;t imagine what you&#039;re watching.<br />
<br />
But even if you did put yourself into the mindset of the four or five complete freaks who will always like your horrible product and accept the horrendous production, you still have to deal with the story and characters - or lack thereof because this show&#039;s handling of them is so poor that it makes Angel Beats look like Six Feet Under. The plot is focused on a young middle-school kid named Eiji, a kid who screams &quot;I want to be Lelouch&quot; so much that he might as well have had the costume included with his summoning of the Jojo/Ajin stands that represent the superpowers in this show and give him the ability to control people. He was apparently responsible for destroying the world in his youth in order to protect his younger dying sister, and due to the terror caused by that incident, he isolates himself from the rest of the world with only some mysterious girl who&#039;s name I can&#039;t remember due to how little importance she actually had to keep him company. One day however, another mysterious girl named Rin transfers to his classroom, intent on taking revenge for her family due to them being a casualty of Eiji&#039;s crime, only to be put under his control and turned into his masochistic love slave thanks to her immortality. However, with her comes a giant organization intent on exploiting Eiji&#039;s powers for their own gain, and Eiji ends up awakening to his potential as an Order user in order to deal with all that happening in his life, keep his sister happy, and save/destroy the world. What follows is what I can only describe as the writers of this show throwing out a ton of toys from their Geass/Evangelion-ripoff box and seeing which one sticks.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s really appalling just how much happens in this show and yet not a single thing that does is engaging because of the show&#039;s utter disregard for context. There&#039;s a lot of plot, but there&#039;s so little story behind it to the point that it feels like an abridged series without the dubbing. Eiji himself is pretty bland as a lead character, only being defined by what the plot tells him to do and nothing else when it takes a break. The only thing close to an engaging hook is the questions brought up regarding whether you&#039;d save or destroy the world if you had the power to do so, but Big Order never expounds on the philosophies the characters have towards this theme with anything more than either a token &quot;well that&#039;s how they feel&quot; or because &quot;I&#039;m an anime character&quot;, which is about as tacked on a reason as you can get short of &quot;because I&#039;m in a porno&quot;. And speaking of being an anime character, it&#039;s really hard to take anyone seriously because they all look like rejected cosplay competitors, they&#039;re all lame anime stereotypes whose humor blends poorly with the setting, and all the girls and one or two guys fall for our bland male character&#039;s cock to the point that they don&#039;t mind actually getting pregnant from him. Oh and yes, that pregnant or not pregnant bunny girl looks a lot like Rei Ayanami. Because you can&#039;t be a post-90s anime if you&#039;re not ripping off Evangelion (and you can&#039;t be a post-2012 anime if you&#039;re not ripping off Jojo).<br />
<br />
I strongly advise not trying to connect everything that happens on your first watch, because there are some things in life that the human mind just isn&#039;t made to comprehend. The best I can summarize it is that there&#039;s this organization that opposes the one that wants to use Eiji, his father is the true reason behind the world&#039;s destruction, his sister is incredibly vital to the plan, there&#039;s a bunch of crazy men, there&#039;s a bunch of even crazier ladies, and not a single thing I just spoiled matters because the ending shits over everything that happened prior in a way that I won&#039;t go into, but let&#039;s just say I didn&#039;t make that Eiji: The Harem King joke earlier lightly. Oh, and there&#039;s incest. According to manga fans, the incest is something the anime added because…there is no justification to add incest. It&#039;s incest. It&#039;s fucking disgusting.<br />
<br />
But then again, I guess that&#039;s why it was included in the first place. Because one thing I&#039;ve learned from watching Evangelion clone after Evangelion clone is that they always focus on the more disturbing parts of that series and never on, y&#039;know, the reason why those disturbing parts worked in the first place? And Big Order definitely does not break that mold, what with its prepubescent sex, violent usage of superpowers, and of course, the nuclear missile I mentioned earlier. Of course, Devadasy at least had some balls in regards to its pretentious imagery. For all of Big Order&#039;s claims to be edgy trash, it never goes far enough with that adjective and just ends up being plain trash. None of that prepubescent sex I mentioned leads to anything interesting let alone actual penetration, and the violence is hard to take seriously when it&#039;s executed like a Xebec production. You know Xebec, right? The guys responsible for Argevollen and Tokyo ESP? Why yes, I did remind you those shows existed, and now you want to kill me for it.<br />
<br />
The only positive I really have for Big Order is that the monochrome effect used to indicate a different dimension in the final episode was alright. Other than that though, Big Order is a classic victim of being birthed from a lack of imagination and teeth, unable to make what it rips off its own and suffering massively for it. I wouldn&#039;t join its massive hate base in calling it one of the worst anime of all-time, but I also wouldn&#039;t recommend it even if you&#039;re a trash-lover. Most of the trash anime this year alone at least had good animation and visual direction that could carry you if you just mute the screen and turn off the subtitles. The only way Big Order would look good to you is if you wore sunglasses and then poured acid all over your eyes.

    How original! A Big Order review with a 1! But instead of explaining all the little details as to why this show sucks so much, I will explain why it deserves a 1 with a much more simple reason.<br />
<br />
Big Order is one of those shows were 15 minutes after I finish an episode, I completely forget what the hell I just watched.<br />
<br />
Not because the story is complex or deep, meaning the forgetting of a few themes here and there is only natural. (Big Order is a thematically heavy show but really who cares?)<br />
<br />
Not because I didn&#039;t want to remember anything, since the show was such

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222460">
        a chore to watch in the first place.<br />
<br />
But because remembering anything about this show would be detrimental to my health. Scientists call it post-traumatic amnesia. A state of confusion that occurs after a traumatic brain injury. That&#039;s Big Order in a nutshell.<br />
<br />
Quiz me on anything about Big Order and I&#039;ll probably either not remember anything, or my brain will shut itself off and I&#039;ll fall into a deep coma in order to protect my sanity from the nightmare fuel that is Big Order.<br />
<br />
You&#039;ll probably be like &quot;YO THIS MEANS YOUR REVIEW IS INACCURATE CAUSE AMNESIA! YOUR INFO IS FAULTY!&quot; While my info may be faulty, I&#039;m one of the many victims of this travesty, and we are first hand sources.<br />
<br />
I see a lot of people calling it THE COMEDY OF THE SEASON!!!! A show so stupid that it probably took more effort the dumb down the show to its current level than to write a coherent story. An &quot;intentionally unintentional comedy&quot; or some shit. And I somewhat agree. Except...<br />
<br />
First of all, Mayoiga is the comedy of the season, thank you very much.<br />
<br />
Second of all, I think being an intentional unintentional comedy really depends on one&#039;s viewing habits of the show. <br />
<br />
Mayoiga became so dumb so fast that I started watching FOR the dumbness. I watched it so that I could laugh at it with my friend. It has a bunch of themes sure, but the execution of the themes coincide with what made the show bad (theme of distrust among strangers = extremely stupid character decisions that never fail to bring a smirk to my ever emotionless face). So really, the themes were part of the unintentional comedy all along.<br />
<br />
Big Order isn&#039;t really like that... it has a bunch of themes that are just... there. Again, I really don&#039;t remember EXACTLY what the hell was in this pile of dung beetle food.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll need to think of a theme... hmm...<br />
<br />
Oh here&#039;s one I guess, the theme of obedience. Obey the order! Absolute authority over something! If you&#039;re abusing your power for the &quot;right cause,&quot; is it justified?<br />
<br />
The main character&#039;s power lets him do just that: have absolute control over those within an area around him. They could have done some amazing psychological stuff with this power, and well... they really don&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Some of it is used solely for comedy, like the Yuno reskin trying to find a way around this power, only to fail miserably. Some of it is used for forced drama, like when some character conveniently has a way around the power, only to result in more bullshit plot points. <br />
<br />
Oh, and can we also mention how the civilians have like no mind of their own? They are literally just one character copy and pasted a few dozen times. They all think the same, none of them have any sort of subtlety or doubt, and they just follow what some other character is thinking. One character thinks the main character must die, so do the civilians! One character thinks that the main character is worth forgiving, so do the civilians! It&#039;s like I&#039;m watching some monty python or something.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I don&#039;t want to wrack my brain about this show too long. I can already feel the cancer cells eating away at my temporal lobe. <br />
<br />
See you guys on the other side ;-;<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Hello, are you the one who ordered the Big Order of dog shit?<br />
<br />

    One of the most terrible shows I have ever seen, 8/10.<br />
<br />
Blend together Mirai Nikki with Code Geass, add in Jojo Stands, and the music of Persona 5, then try to fit it all into 10 episodes. That’s Big Order.<br />
<br />
Character motivations make no sense, the rules controlling what powers can and can’t do make no sense, half way through it seems as though the show itself has forgotten what the story is. It’s the just stuff happening one after the other without much pause to let anything connect. So much of this show feels as though it’s ripping off other anime, I’ve seen this before, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420303">
        done better…<br />
<br />
I should hate it, but I don’t, I love it.<br />
<br />
The music was funky enough to dance to, and didn’t go with the scenes often enough that that itself would make me burst into laughter. The story was so incomprehensible that it kept me engaged throughout, The way the show kept managing to outdo it’s own level of BS was hilarious.<br />
<br />
Grab some friends, some alcohol and binge it. I promise you that you’ll enjoy the experience. <br />
<br />
I may not have enjoyed the show for reasons that the makers would’ve wanted me to enjoy it, but nevertheless I really enjoyed it. And that’s the only thing that matters to me in scoring an anime.

    It is quite ironic that the OP track is named DISORDER because evidently; big order has a disorder to say the least.<br />
<br />
Where do I start?<br />
<br />
I am still trying to come to terms how the same person who made this travesty also made the thrilling Future Diary. Funny enough, everything that was wrong with Future Diary is exemplified with the biggest microscope you could find:<br />
<br />
Inconsistent story-line (✓) <br />
Second rate Yuno Gasai (✓)<br />
Animation that makes one piece look like it was produced by Ufotable (✓)<br />
Big Order being Big Stupid 99% of the time (✓)<br />
Main character being a p*ssy magnet (✓)<br />
so SO  many underdeveloped characters (✓)<br />
<br />
I would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224033">
        usually right a proper review but even I cant justify why Big Order is worth writing a proper review for. <br />
<br />
Any saving graces? Well there will be uncensored boobs on the Blu-ray I guess and even with all its faults, I still ended up reading the manga.<br />
<br />
Anyway what are you still doing here, this is one train-wreck you should avoid.<br />

    Big Order is simply put a very, very bad anime. <br />
In all honesty, I wasn&#039;t expecting great things, but considering the premise seems pretty interesting I decided to check it out. <br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, I don&#039;t hate it, but I&#039;m sick of 14 yo teens fighting and wanting to rule the world for a stupid reason. <br />
<br />
Things that I like:<br />
- opening is great <br />
- animation is good<br />
- Rin and Bunny girl are somehow enjoyable<br />
<br />
Things I dislike:<br />
-Everyone else is annoying<br />
-Horrible made fanservice + censor<br />
-Overpowered teens<br />
-Full of cliches<br />
-Incest (they aren&#039;t really brothers, but their relationship is cringy)<br />
-10 episodes, I doubt this will have a good ending<br />
-Some

If you are a newcomer and you really like Mirai Nikki, Owari no Seraph etc. give it a try. Maybe you&#039;ll like this and that&#039;s okay, too. <br />
<br />
If you want more mature and plausible things to entertain you don&#039;t watch it because it&#039;s poor made.

    Sometimes, we inexplicably watch awful shows. Why we watch them or how isn&#039;t relevant; we just sit down and do it. And sometimes, we come across shows that are so offensively awful that we sit down and wonder what was even the point, or shows that are so blatantly offensive that we have no clue why would anyone in their right-mind derive any kind of enjoyment from them.<br />
<br />
Before moving further, I need to stress out something; if you liked Mirai Nikki, then that does not necessarily mean you will like this show. I am no fan of Mirai Nikki, but for what its worth, it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221110">
        was at least colorful and entertaining enough to watch all the way to the end.<br />
Also, if you were looking for a quick answer as to whether or not a show is worth watching, here&#039;s one; this is only worth watching for all the wrong reasons, aka the so bad it&#039;s good rule.<br />
<br />
Big Order isn&#039;t colorful, but it certainly is entertaining for a wide variety of reasons.<br />
<br />
For one, the story is complete and utter garbage. I&#039;ve never seen a story constantly break rules literally minutes after making them, then make even more rules to attempt to cover that up...and fail miserably. Not only that, but the characters&#039; actions in comparison to what is actually going on makes no sense the more you think about it; this story more or less reeks of the feeling that the &quot;writer&quot; was making up the story as she rolled with it rather than any particular thought that was put into the &quot;script&quot;.<br />
<br />
Oh, and let us not forget the dialogue. It largely consists of our main character screaming &quot;SENA&quot; and Sena screaming &quot;EIJI&quot; or more infamously &quot;ONII-CHAN&quot; (in a manner that would put most hentai doujins to shame), as well as its various dumb attempts at drama.<br />
<br />
Speaking of drama, have I mentioned how absolutely retarded some of these character powers are? A girl that gets pregnant if a guy touches her? The main character basically having what feels like the combination of the Geass power from Code Geass and a Stand from Jojo without half the thought that went into either? The main pseudo-heroine (and I refer to her a pseudo-heroine because the main heroine is clearly SENAAAAAAAAAAAA) being immortal? The list goes on and on, but to put it simply; these powers feel like they were slapped together without the slightest shred of thought as to how they would affect the immersion of the story. But no power is as immersion breaking as Eiji&#039;s ability to control territory; seriously, this power is so broken that it ruins all immersion that the story would have because there&#039;s no feeling of tension, since we, the viewers, always know that he&#039;ll come out on top.<br />
<br />
That, and its dumb excuse of...nationalism? Seriously, why would a council of totally generic villains want to control the world again? <br />
<br />
Thematically speaking, this show is broken...because I actually have no point what it&#039;s about, even after all is said and done. The script takes influence from a lot of works like I said earlier, ranging from Code Geass to Jojo to Evangelion to elements from the writer&#039;s earlier work, Mirai Nikki. But NOTHING works; at some point we have the nationalist themes from Code Geass, then another where it has Stands like Jojo, and then the last bits of the show go full-on End of Evangelion on everyone for no reason. COPYING AND PASTING PARTS OF SCRIPTS FROM OTHER WORKS DOES NOT WORK.<br />
<br />
The characters are horrible. I&#039;m referring to each and every single last one of them, by the way; at least in Mirai Nikki the entire cast was colorful, if exaggerated to hell and back, and I even had a couple of characters I liked. Here? Not a single one. That being said, they&#039;re all entertaining to watch...because they&#039;re all bloody idiots. Eiji could&#039;ve probably won the entire time if certain circumstances and information was given to him at the beginning, and the fact he WASN&#039;T given said information makes no sense.<br />
<br />
NotYuno (I can&#039;t even remember her name, she&#039;s that irrelevant) is basically Yuno, only not as entertainingly crazy and more of the entertainingly random, if only because her characterization makes no sense and she acts like an idiot who also happens to like the guy who might&#039;ve murdered everyone and caused an apocalypse only to seduce him on numerous occasions then go yandere then go back again and...do you see where I&#039;m going with this?<br />
<br />
Sena is...well, discussing her would spoil the whole show, but I only have two words: Onii-chan.<br />
<br />
Artwork is more or less the same style as Mirai Nikki, which is OK I guess. What is not OK is the absolutely atrocious animation quality, which has absolutely horrid use of CGI throughout the show, lots of still frames and repeated shots, little to no movement for most of the show and incredibly annoying looking dark shading that feels like the whole show is trying to be darker than it actually is.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack is equally horrible, voice-acting is bad, and all in all, I do not recommend this show...<br />
<br />
...But wait, I do. I recommend this show. This show is entertainingly bad in ways that I didn&#039;t think humanly possible. It&#039;s the very definition of...well, not a trainwreck, since you actually need to have a train moving properly to go wrong. This is complete and utter chaos, and the sheer combination of all of said elements make for an incredibly entertaining watch, especially if with friends or drunk...though the sheer awfulness of this show may straight up make you want to kill yourself if you get depressed while drinking. Actually, maybe just skip the drinking part, I don&#039;t want blood on my hands.<br />
<br />
Everyone else? Stay as far away as humanly possible.

    There is a lot bad things being said about Big Order anime, and while many of them are true, I believe it&#039;s hated more than it deserves. Why? I&#039;ll try to explain it in this review!<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Weakest and, in a way, strongest point of Big Order. First of all, take a look at the genre: action shounen. It&#039;s not another Mirai Nikki, and while synopsis and even first episode kinda sell it as something more psychological, it is not. It&#039;s action anime and if you expect anything more, you will be seriously disappointed.<br />
Saying it&#039;s rushed would be a huge understatement. Things happen too fast with too

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221108">
        few explanations, leading to plot holes, illogical developments and deus ex machina solutions.<br />
On the other hand it&#039;s interesting and unique. The story managed to keep me interested through whole anime and some twists even surprised me - and I don&#039;t mean unpredictable ones caused by the lack of explanations earlier in the story. Conflict, while chaotic and, again, lacking deeper explanation, makes one wonder who is right. By the last episode I wasn&#039;t sure if protagonist is doing the right thing - that is a huge plus for me.<br />
In the end I believe all the shortcomings of the story are coming down to time and pacing. If this anime had 26 episodes and everything was explained and developed before progressing further, I&#039;m sure we&#039;d be talking totally differently about Big Order now.<br />
<br />
Art/Sound:<br />
When it comes to graphics, Big Order is doing fine. Nothing special - it just looks good, with some better and worse moments. Though big minus for censored bath episode!<br />
Now, sound is where it gets good. Music is nice, sure, but what&#039;s more important is using it during episodes. So often all the music in anime is limited to OP and ED, I just can&#039;t ignore when music starts playing in middle of episode! While it could be played more often and we could also use more variety, it&#039;s still very good.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Similar situation to what I wrote about story - not enough time, not enough development, not enough explaining. Yes, they are interesting. Damn, I&#039;d even say they were great characters, especially Rin with her yandere/tsundere mix, but with how rushed everything was, I can only say &quot;wasted potential&quot;.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I&#039;m not sure how I would feel if I watched it while airing, but doing it my usual way - by watching all at once - I wasn&#039;t bored even for one second, which for me qualifies it as an enjoyable anime. It might not be some piece of art, but it serves its purpose of burning free time perfectly and ends in a way that leaves watcher satisfied.<br />
<br />

    Have you ever wondered why you aren&#039;t happy in the universe you are living in? It&#039;s probably because somewhere deep down in your subconscious you know this anime exists. I can only wonder what type of madness or psychotic affliction plauged the creators of this show when they made it. Now before I continue ranting on how bad this show is, allow me to break it into the specific categories.<br />
<br />
STORY: Now let me tell you, this section shouldn&#039;t exist. The creators of the show created a world where there logically shouldn&#039;t be a story. The characters have all the tools at there disposals to instantly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223969">
        solve any problem they are faced with, but they don&#039;t. The creators had to suck all intelligence away from a large majority of the characters just to make sure that they didn&#039;t break the universe and achieve their goals during episode 1-2. In fact I would like you to play a game while watching Big Order. Count all the ways that the main characters sister could be healed but isn&#039;t. Let&#039;s see if you can keep the number under five. The story doesn&#039;t make any sense, and logic and reasoning are sacrificed in (Big) order to keep the story going. There is some enjoyment to be had however, to watch the fallacies unfold while the show takes itself very very seriously. It&#039;s quite bizzare how the show thinks it is being clever and smart but in reality it just makes he viewer want to bang their head against a wall because of how dumb everything is. Also something I noticed is the show gets less and less intelligent the farther into it you watch. By the time you reach the last episode the show just unloads a large pile of nonsense on the viewer, but the main character is crying and yelling so I guess they were trying to have it by climactic, but in reality it was the largest pile of nonsense I have ever seen on screen.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: Hoshimya Eiji is the main character and one of the most powerful characters I have ever seen in any form of media...he is also one of the least intelligent so it balances out. This character is a high level reality warper and his powers extend to being able to manipulate people, and yet he still finds himself being manipulated and controlled by the people under his control. He is also a selfish asshole, and after completing the show, has me convinced that he is the main antagonist while the supposed &quot;villians&quot; of the show are actually the good guys. Eiji is the type of character who would actively fight against every one to ever exist receiving eternal happiness, and the turn around and achieve that for himself while the rest of humanity continues to suffer. But it&#039;s okay because he cries and screams alot so that means that he is a deep and interesting character...right?<br />
<br />
Hoshimya Sena is Eiji&#039;s useless sister and his love interest. If you haven&#039;t built up a resistance to incest in your entertainment after Game of Thrones, this anime (alone wih 50% of other animes) will help you achieve that goal. Creepy love interest aside, she is Eiji&#039;s sister and definitely got the dominant Dumb gene just like her brother, only she has a healthy dose of crippling illness that is supposed to make me want to sympathise with her, but in reality I wish she had died the first time she got stabbed. Really the only reason I am even talking about her is because she is a key component in one of the shows least intelligent moments, and that is saying alot because this show is filled to the brim with dumb moments. There is nothing redeemable about this character even though the show tries to make her a very deep character.<br />
<br />
Iyo is the best character in the show and one of the best characters ever made in any anime ever. I heavily encourage you to watch this show just until you learn what is special and her rabbit ears. It is bound to have you die from laughter because it is one of the most silly concepts ever invented and yet is executed in a very serious and non comedic manner, which successfully amplifies the hilarity.<br />
<br />
Conclusion : As a masochist I love watching bad anime in (big) order to make fun of them. Big Order is a great anime to watch for this purpose. It will make you wonder what type of mental disease the person who had this show pitched to them and still decided to throw their money at it. Things happen in this show that don&#039;t need to because anyone wih half a brain could have solved the issue three episodes ago. Don&#039;t get me wrong this show is terrible. Like Mahouka terrible. But it is one the best comedies to come out this year. You should watch it just to have your mind go numb from trying to figure the show out. Unless you aren&#039;t into intentionally putting yourself through torturous situations because you enjoy the tingly feeling of pain roiling throughout every cell of your body until it makes you want to scream in ecstasy ... and if that&#039;s the case, I guess to each their own.<br />
