    “You really seem to love me when I’m Taro.” - Miyo Sasaki<br />
<br />
Nakitai Watashi wa Neko wo Kaburu, or A Whisker Away is a movie with the main theme of cats. Yes, many cats, a lot of cats. A light romance content with the supernatural matter involved, resulting in a perfect combination of the movie.<br />
<br />
Story - 9/10<br />
The story starts off pretty quickly, so watching a trailer at least once is recommended. The storytelling begins with Miyo’s family, Miyo’s relationship with her friends, and how she got a mask that allows her to transform into a cat. The overall concept can be understood within 10 minutes or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344302">
        less, giving you time to enjoy the whole movie instead of making you try to understand what’s going on. The whole concept is interesting and unique, making A Whisker Away became a must-watch. The movie also maintains the proportion of the supernatural element and the daily life element at the appropriate level, being not too heavy on one side. Lastly, I would say that the story contains both sad and happy moments, leading to a satisfying conclusion.<br />
<br />
Animation - 10/10<br />
Eye-friendly, tender, and cute, these 3 words describe the art perfectly. While not being as vibrant as Your Name or Tenki no Ko, instead, A Whisker Away shows its own charm of art in the usage of colors. The art matches and creates the tender mood and tone of the movie, and when combined with such high-quality scenery art, a score of 10 is obtained easily.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8/10<br />
The overall soundtracks are pretty standard. During my 104-minute watch, I noticed nothing outstanding, also nothing has bugged me. While A Whisker Away may not have the best soundtrack, it has the perfect ending songs, perfectly matched my music taste. Yes, 2 ending songs, both are sweet and lovely, and both performed by Yorushika. The 2nd song is kind of a surprise since the song hasn’t been released before.<br />
<br />
Characters - 8/10<br />
A 104-minute length might not be enough to introduce supporting characters fully, but it was able to introduce audiences the main characters to its fullest.<br />
<br />
Miyo Sasaki and Kento Hinode, these 2 main characters are the star of the show. Miyo, or nicknamed as Muge, is introduced as an energetic girl, having a crush on Hinode, which is literally a normal guy. Miyo is being ignored and not being liked back by Hinode is not her only problem. While handling this matter, both Miyo and Hinode also have their own personal problems to deal with. Thus by not understanding each other may lead to hurting one another without knowing. This is how characters have completed the story and bringing the potential to the movie.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 9/10<br />
A Whisker Away is cute, being a unique watch, not many shows have animals as their main theme, and this movie is a success. What I enjoyed the most is the art and the theme song, which are totally charming and beautiful, matching the sweet and tender mood of the story. Overall, this movie left me an impression. My 104-minute watch is well spent.<br />
<br />
Recommendations<br />
If you are looking for a unique movie with a light supernatural element, romance, and eye-friendly art, then I recommend this anime, or even if you just love cats. Enjoy!<br />

    Whilst A Whisker Away had a strong premise it didn&#039;t really take me by surprise. In fact, I think that it was way lower than my expectations before I watched it. <br />
<br />
A Whisker Away&#039;s story and concept felt like something Disney would make but instead of their generic cartoony art style per se it&#039;s anime art style instead. There&#039;s also something highly unappealing about a romance portrayed by cats. It feels too generic. It feels like I&#039;ve seen this too many times before in the past, I just can&#039;t be bothered to see anymore. <br />
<br />
Other than the story, the art is exceptionally beautiful and reminded

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344341">
        me of a beautiful show called &quot;Tsuki Ga Kirei&quot;. Which was peradventure one of the best romance I&#039;ve ever seen. The background musics and voice acting are also satisfactory, thus I have no comment on that as well. <br />
<br />
All in all, I think that I wasted about 2 hours of my life watching something I don&#039;t usually watch. I got so bored I had to reinstall clash royale on my phone and play it occasionally as the movie proceeds. A Whisker Away didn&#039;t really grasp my heart, and it&#039;s probably the first anime movie that I&#039;ve watched that actually wasn&#039;t that enjoying.<br />
<br />
A Whisker Away Summary : &quot;Don&#039;t be deceived by a big fat bitch just because you&#039;re depressed.&quot; <br />
<br />
I recommend this to.. I don&#039;t really know actually. Just watch it. You either like it or you hate it. That&#039;s how it goes anyways. <br />

    &quot;Wow, a work from Junichi Satou (Aria, Tamayura) and Mari Okada (MSG:IBO, AnoHana, Lupin III: Mine Fujiko), must be great!&quot; These were my initial thoughts about this movie before watching it until my hopes were shattered when I actually got to watch this movie.<br />
<br />
Story 3/10<br />
A super clingy, full of energy girl Miyo Sasaki, nicknamed &quot;Muge&quot; who&#039;s in love with her classmate Kento Hinode, her indefatigable tries to get the attention of her crush were in vain so she thought of becoming a cat to get close to her crush which later turned out to be a deadly mistake because she had to throw her humanity

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344315">
        if she wanted to continue being a cat. The premise sounds normal but it&#039;s later butchered by it&#039;s own progress due to ambiguous and unexplained actions and sequences. <br />
<br />
Art and Animation 6/10<br />
The art was the best thing about this movie something that was granted to come in a work directed by Junichi Satou, the background art really reminded me of Tamayura. The animation was so-so, keeping in mind that it was done by the same studio that made Penguin Highway, a movie which excels in both art and animation. Sad too see that they downgraded the visuals rather than improving it. <br />
<br />
Sound 5/10<br />
Couple of OSTs here and there, nothing to great and worth memorable. It had no opening song and the ending song was mediocre as well. <br />
<br />
Character 2/10<br />
The characters were written lively, they felt alive. But that solely couldn&#039;t make them good or likable. Really disliked the main girl &quot;Muge&quot;, really energetic, someone who&#039;d just go and want to become a cat forever because she got rejected once despite her awfully clingy behavior and without even thinking about the consequences that were to come with it (e.g. leaving behind her close friend, and her parents who try their best to take care of her). And then there&#039;s her close friend who really should be the MC of this movie but her name is forgettable that even I don&#039;t remember even tho I just finished watching this movie, same can be said for Hinode&#039;s friend. Hinode, the male MC gives of serious furry vibes and likes to be kissed by a cat, he&#039;s a typical edgy teenage boy who&#039;d try to do anything for his love even brawl with a giant cat, maybe that&#039;s because he&#039;s a furry.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 3/10<br />
You know what I enjoyed in this movie? The background scenery. <br />
<br />
Overall it&#039;s nothing more than a 3, a big disappointment coming from names such as Mari Okada and Junichi Satou. Tho it made me realize how much I love Tamayura, maybe I might do a rewatch.

    From first seeing the trailer I had very high expectations for this film and they were definitely met. This is my first review so I’m sorry in advance if it’s not too well wrote, it also may contain spoilers.<br />
 In the first twenty minutes of the film I felt almost disappointed with how it was going and how annoying the main characters was but as the story continued on her character development was just wonderful. She went from being an annoying stalker student to becoming a more relatable character.<br />
I think the story is probably 9 almost an 8. If you’ve started to watch it and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344266">
        do feel bored please continue watching it because it’s extremely unique!<br />
<br />
For sound I’d give it 9. The sound for the anime was also pretty great, the music was wonderful and went it came to some of the voice acting I wasn’t too sure. I found some of the actors to have extremely bland voices for their characters.<br />
<br />
As for the characters for me it’s and easy 10. As I said before Miyo Sasaki is a really annoying character to beginning with. She’s a love struck girl who obsesses a lot over her crush who at first doesn’t really like her. As the story continues to go on her character becomes more calmer and more of a relatable character if she wasn’t before. At some parts I could even put myself into her shoes which I always find is a great feature of the anime. <br />
At first Kento Hinode just seems like the average the anime boy crush but he’s so much more. Like Miyo, Kento has a lot of hardships at home which he never shows through his emotions when he’s around others, in a sense he’s a very strong character and if he did speak of how he felt he spoke his words to taro who he sincerely trusted. As the film goes on the two characters go on an emotional ride of emotions and Kento realises his feelings for Taro/Miyo.<br />
<br />
My enjoyment for this film would be 9. As I’ve said before I didn’t enjoy the first part of the film but as I watched it more I enjoyed it so much more. If I was to sit and watch the film again I’d probably give it a 10.<br />
<br />
Overall I give this film 10! For me at least I enjoy this film an awful lot, I even found parts of it much more enjoyable more than some of the other popular films like your name and weathering with you.<br />
After waiting all this time because of the pandemic this film was definitely worth it and I would for sure recommend it to anyone, young or old! <br />

    There&#039;s absolutely no problem with the animation style, quality and music. However, the main character is not one of the worst, but the worst character I&#039;ve ever seen in anime. She is selfish and have zero empathy towards anyone. ANYONE. You&#039;d argue that she cares about the Hinode guy, but NO. She has no sense of respect for his personal space, nor any care of how he feels. Stalking, invading, and using her butt to bump into him... I honestly wouldn&#039;t blame that guy not liking her. This whole changing relationship between Hinode and her is extremely forced and unrealistic. Yes, I get it, these

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344593">
        2 are main characers and are supposed to be together, but man, it just makes me frustrated to watch such an unrealistic turnout. I am not done with this movie as I am writing this review, but I kind of wish this movie actually takes from a character&#039;s perspective truly. All the cliche lines such as &quot;I want to tell him how I feel&quot; just simply feel annoying. I think I&#039;m just complaining here since I&#039;m trying to make myself make it to the end and have to let it out. But this link captures how I feel about this film truly. <br />

&quot;I used to wish the world would end. Every single day.&quot; - Miyo<br />
<br />
This film was one of the few that I enjoyed but at the same time disappointed about. Sure, its entertaining and yes, it may have put a smile on my face from time to time. But the subpar execution of the story is something I just couldn&#039;t overlook.<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
<br />
Starting with the plot, it was, in two words, poorly executed. The plot presents a good and solid premise of &quot;girl who turns into a cat&quot;, but with a far from perfect execution. <br />
<br />
Presented in a linear fashion for the most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344281">
        part, the storyline may seem predictable for some. But this main complaint didn&#039;t really take away my enjoyment for the film&#039;s story. <br />
<br />
What the story is lacking in is in its execution of romance. While the aspect of the supernatural had an okay-ish execution, I just couldn&#039;t see any real motivation as to why Miyo likes Hinode in the first place (more on that in the characters section of my review). This literally is what this film was built on. If it weren&#039;t for this crucial detail that Miyo likes Hinode, the other events wouldn&#039;t have transpired in the first place. Romance, the key theme in the story, feels forced and unnatural. It pains me to see a premise that has so much potential that was ruined by superficial characters and a less than stellar storytelling. For that, I&#039;ll give the story a disappointing 6. <br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
<br />
The art style and animation is beautiful but nothing game changing. For the most part, the art style is average.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
When it comes to soundtracks/music, it was okay. It fits the mood and pacing consistently. The sound design in Nakitai Watashi wa Neko wo Kaburu is nothing extraordinary or groundbreaking though. It just works and is passable. <br />
<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
<br />
The set of characters in the film were the most disappointing for me. Not so much that I hated the characters for who they were but how badly written they are. The film fails to present or even touch on the subject as to why Miyo likes Hinode. They lack a genuine motivation as to why they did this or that. As a romance-centered film, it must have good character writing, but in this film, there wasn&#039;t. The characters simply feel inorganic and mere plot devices. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
<br />
Despite its weakness in its set of characters and lacking plot, I was still able to enjoy this anime film because of its lighthearted nature. This film helped me cheer up even for a bit and for that, I gave the film a 8/10 in enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6.8/10<br />
<br />
To recap, if all you want to watch is a wholesome and lighthearted film that will cheer you up, I highly recommend this! Otherwise, this might not be the film you&#039;re looking for.<br />
<br />
P.S. This is my first review and since you&#039;ve read this far, I would really appreciate it if you would click &#039;Helpful&#039; so others can see it too!

    &quot;Nakitai Watashi wa Neko wo Kaburu&quot; has got to be one of the most bizzare anime films I&#039;ve ever seen. While some may speculate that this is due to the subject matter of a girl turning into a cat, it&#039;s not. It&#039;s more so the fact that said girl is unintentionally (I think) portrayed as a complete cringe worthy lunatic who&#039;s freakishly obsessed with a boy who barely even acknowledges her existence. <br />
<br />
<br />
STORY - 6/10<br />
<br />
The story, as stated by the summary, is about a girl who gains the ability to transform into a cat in order to get close to her crush. A potentially cute

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344432">
        and wholesome story marred by freakish character motivations and generic plodding. The concept of the story could have been really interesting given the right direction. There are moments where the film explores the philosophical dilemma of whether or not giving up your humanity is worth a carefree and happy life, though unfortunately this concept is abandoned after about two minutes of attention, and again we&#039;re forced to focus on a girl&#039;s uninteresting journey towards one sided love. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art - 8/10<br />
<br />
Nothing to really complain about. It&#039;s good, it&#039;s pretty, it&#039;s safe. Environmental backgrounds are nice to look at. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound - 6/10 <br />
<br />
I give this a 6 because...well, there isn&#039;t really anything noticeable that sonically occurs besides one mediocre guitar pop song. It&#039;s completely forgettable. <br />
<br />
<br />
Character - 5/10<br />
<br />
Muge, the protagonist, has to be one of the most unintentionally disturbing and bizarre lead characters I&#039;ve ever seen. This girl is OBSESSED with the male lead, Hinode, and the film never really bothers to tell us why. Not once are we given an explanation as to why Muge is so madly in love with Hinode, or even how they really know each other. This creates a dynamic between the two that is incredibly cringeworthy. For example, there are scenes in which Muge will frenetically declare her love towards Hinode to the whole school. Knowing that Hinode clearly does not feel the same way about her, along with the rest of her classmates looks of confusion and judgement, creates such a strong sense of secondhand embarrassment that it almost made me want to stop watching. <br />
<br />
About halfway through I stopped seeing this film as a cute ghibli esque movie and instead saw it as a character piece about a girl who&#039;s seriously psychologically damaged and needs therapy. This perception made the film a bit more humorous and entertaining, but that&#039;s obviously not what the film was going for. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 6/10<br />
<br />
The cat&#039;s were fun when they appeared. That&#039;s about all I enjoyed really, were the cat scenes. All the human elements of the story were so strangely and predictably pieced together that it became annoying to sit through. Though, as stated previously, one could view the film differently than the filmmakers intended. Instead of a cute boring cat film, it could become a seriously messy and ironic psychological drama. <br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL - 6/10<br />
<br />
This movie was fucking weird man. What could&#039;ve been a cute and romantic yet intricate meditation on the costs of desiring to escape humanity instead becomes a creepy and cringe worthy film that follows a young girl stalking and making unwanted advances on her one sided crush, and how that&#039;s apparently a good thing according to the films ending.

    &quot;Hinode Sunrise Attack&quot; <br />
<br />
This was the Best Part...... jk :P <br />
<br />
When I first saw the trailer of this movie right after it was released, I was quite impressed by it. The Art, the sound and the Plot seemed so Interesting and that is why I had my hopes high. Not that this movie failed to impress me, its just that it was not enough. <br />
<br />
Story - 8 <br />
<br />
The Plot of this film is very interesting and new (at least for me). However, The story was quite predictable and sober. There wasn&#039;t any suspense/climax (sorry I want to say something else...... but I lost the word..

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344329">
        T-T please don&#039;t judge) in the end, How can I say........Non MC characters saved them(don&#039;t wanna spoil). <br />
<br />
Art - 8<br />
<br />
Art and Animation was pretty smooth and Decent.<br />
<br />
Sound - 6<br />
<br />
Soundtrack was not that great I would say. It didn&#039;t match the scenario and keeps on playing ignoring that. <br />
(Film Could have been much more enjoyable with a better soundtrack)<br />
<br />
Character - 8<br />
<br />
All the supporting characters received good amount of screen time. Miyo&#039;s characters was obviously explored the most. She had two personalities. 1st when she is herself: Happy and friendly, Miss Ultra Gaga and Enigmatic. 2nd when she is a cat with Hinode: All Calm and Sweet, Taro <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10 <br />
<br />
Even tho the Story was pretty weak. I enjoyed it fully. But Like I said above, Could have been much more enjoyable with a better soundtrack. I enjoy these kind of movies the most. <br />
<br />
Overall - 8 <br />
<br />
Overall I would say, You should watch this as soon as possible. I don&#039;t know if it worth your time or not. There is a chance you might not like film much. But I would recommend this to Everyone. <br />
<br />

    A whisker&#039;s away&#039;s story is serviceable,but nothing more.The art is aesthetically pleasing to look at,the story and concept are decently executed on,(although the spiritual realm and cats elements really leave a lot to be desired in terms of originality)but you never feel like the movie is something that you would really remember once a good few months pass.<br />
<br />
This movie has a clear beginning conflict,climax and resolution which isn´t anything bad necesarily,but it does make many of the story beats quite predictable,since the movie doesn´t really do much with them.I feel like Penguin highway was much more playful and unpredictable with its story beats in this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344477">
        regard.Let me once again emphasize that being safe isn´t a bad thing,but it doesn´t make something extraordinary either.<br />
<br />
The progression of the relationship between the characters feel forced and unnatural,since when you take into account that the girl has been disguising herself as a cat this whole time,the fact that the boy accepted it so wholeheartedly without being absolutely weirded out really makes me question the whole nature of this relationship.It really does make the scenes of him touching the cat all over much more awkward,but that´s just me.<br />
<br />
I feel like the beginning part of the movie did a really bad job of setting up Muge´s relationship with Hinode because of its one sided ness plus her obssessive actions towards coming off as extremely annoying.Dooesn´t matter that he fell in love with her later in the film because she´s been secretly supporting him from the background with the help of her disguise,it still doesn´t excuse the her constantly pushy behaviour.<br />
<br />
There was potential for more interesting storylines to be explored,with other characters,such as the self doubt that Muge´s new stepmother has with herself,but that´s just me wanting the adult characters to be more fleshed put,which isn´t really the point of this movie,so I digress.<br />
<br />
Despite all the bad things I´ve said about this movie,i don´t actually hate it or anything.I think this would perfectly as a family friendly film that you could show to anyone.But let´s say that I´m not really that impressed by these kind of movies because they are a dime a dozen.

    SHORT SPOILER FREE REVIEW:<br />
<br />
Ever since I saw the first trailer a month and a half ago I&#039;ve been eagerly waiting for this movies release and boy was it worth the wait! Whenever Netflix produces either anime series or movies, it&#039;s either an instant hit or miss and let me tell you that Nakitai Watashi wa Neko wo Kaburu definitly is a solid hit and probably even the best anime movie released so far this year (that is if we don&#039;t count the North American release of Tenki no Ko, which is arguably a worthy contender).<br />
<br />
The movie follows the story of Miyo Sasaki and how she

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344264">
        transformed into a cat in order to get closer to Kento Hinode, the guy for whom she has a crush on. I&#039;m going to avoid mentioning any spoilers in this review, but let me say that that&#039;s just the surface of the movie. Nakitai Watashi wa Neko wo Kaburu deals with the emotional and romantic topics really well and this could easily be seen through this movies amazing storyline. I originally thought that the story would just be your average school romance, with a slight twist (since our protagonist can turn into a cat), but it&#039;s actually way deeper than just that.<br />
<br />
The art style is also one of the best that I&#039;ve seen in not only anime movies this year, but also anime in general anime series. If you&#039;ve taken a look at the trailer for this movie, you can see that the limited animation is almost non-existant. The characters (especially the cats) are all drawn in a unique and really cute art style which makes it really easy for the viewer to distinguish the characters apart from one another. The art style for the setting and the background of the movie is also incredibly gorgeous and the soundtrack does a really good job in complementing this, making it a perfect duo between Art and Sound. I personally found the OST quite memorable and I&#039;d even be willing to say that it&#039;s worthy of being the top 10 anime movies with one of the best OST&#039;s.<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;m giving Nakitai Watashi wa Neko wo Kaburu a solid 9/10 and I would definitly recommend checking it out! Definitly one of, if not the, best anime movie released so far this year! &lt;3

    I&#039;m gonna make this short and simple.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the movie and characters, especially how outgoing the main girl is. It&#039;s sorta cliche tho, reserved dude meets &#039;eccentric and expressive&#039; girl, *cough* <br />
 &quot;YLIA&quot; and &quot;I want to eat your pancreas&quot;. I shouldn&#039;t be complaining though, I don&#039;t think i&#039;ve ever seen any other movie like this. Although I would have liked a better backstory of the catland and stuff. <br />
<br />
The magicalness and the cats give me modern Ghibli vibes.<br />
<br />
What really captivated me what the art, it somehow reminded me of a korean anime called &quot;A day before us&quot; with the light and darkish color everything

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344457">
        has. <br />
<br />
Moral of the story is, don&#039;t ever think you&#039;re alone in any situation. There&#039;s always going to be someone that understands you. You just gotta give it time to know the person and eventually when they notice you, they&#039;ll reciprocate their feelings back. <br />
Everyone has a part of them they keep tucked inside so that others won&#039;t see. Being in a dark place isn&#039;t fun at all, hiding your real feelings and thoughts eventually takes a toll on yourself which is why you shouldn&#039;t be afraid to talk to someone about it.<br />
You never know who you&#039;ll least expect to truly understand you, that person could be right under your nose.

    My first ever anime review~<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
The story was beautiful yet predictable. Halfway through the story, I was able to predict what would happen next. Despite that, the story was moving and beautiful. The ideas and concepts in the movie were intuitive and easy to grasp. I didn&#039;t spend that much time wondering anything introduced.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
The art and animation were very bright and lively. The characters&#039; movements were very smooth.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
The soundtrack fits in well with the mood of the film. It was never out of place. The voice actors were able to express their respective characters very well.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
The characters were unique and distinguishable. Every

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344262">
        character had an impact on the story. The cast compliments each other very well.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
From start to finish, I enjoyed the movie. I wasn&#039;t able to notice any negatives (If there were any). Nothing in the movie bothered me.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
Overall, it was a beautiful film. I would recommend watching it. The film was able to make me laugh and feel sad. I believe it would surely be a great watching experience.

    Probably an unpopular opinion but I was really looking forward to this movie but was honestly underwhelmed. The mask seller started off as creepy and mysterious, but just turned out to be an idiot. He should have been a more ominous character although his reason for selling masks wasn&#039;t too bad but sort of cliche. Muge didn&#039;t really have anything to like about her. I would have liked her more as a character if they showed her Dad dying and her Mom leaving to see the pain. Also, the confrontation between Muge&#039;s old Mom and new stepmom was downplayed a lot. The music took away

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344753">
        all the drama from the moment. Hinode was kind of just a bland character who didn&#039;t really struggle too much. We didn&#039;t really get to experience how important pottery was to him apart from the maybe 5 total minutes of screen time the pottery shop got. I think something that would really have elevated the level of the movie, was some flashbacks to back some of the pain that they went through. I found they focused too much on the love and romance part of the movie instead of any sort of character development which is what makes viewers attached to the story. The character/plot development was sooooo cliche. Boy doesn&#039;t like girl, girl loves boy, he thinks they have nothing in common and doesn&#039;t like her, comes to a realization immediately (instead of more gradually showing his feelings) that that girl is important, instantly falls in love. they had one scene in the entire movie apart from the last 20 mins that showed that he was starting to like her, which was when she jumped out of the tree. Regardless of the cat premise (which I found was interesting seeing the trailer and really thought there was so much potential), the studio just kinda used it as a side plot instead. There is a lot to like however. The soundtracks are great, and the animation is amazing. Apart from that, this movie is blehh.

    The fantastic art and the Netflix feature misled me into watching this movie. The trailer also made it seem like this was a &quot;professional&quot; production, for the lack of a better term. The audio is fantastic too. But the main character just absolutely ruins it. The writing was is just plainly bad. Possibly the most unlikable main character in anime history. Every other character in this movie is objectively a nicer character. And the reason why I&#039;m blaming the writing is because the main character does change towards the end, but it is not consistent. The character growth just seemed to follow the &quot;formula&quot; for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344592">
        a good movie.<br />
<br />
Watch it if you want to actively root against the main character.

    i am gonna be honest with you all, this movie was like a waste of time, its like someone tried hard to copy studio ghibli and failed terribly, this movie is super cringy and cliche. <br />
started nicely and then hit a brick wall. this felt like i was forced to watch this movie. <br />
If i had a chance to go back in time and stop myself from watching this movie, then i would definitely do that. <br />
Seriously this movie had the most basic plots and literally the most predictable scenes <br />
Art is the only thing which is decent here but rest of the criteria is

    WARNING: MANY CAT PUNS (just kitten there are only a few puns)<br />
Howdy reader, this review won&#039;t contain any spoilers nor will it go into deep detail about any sort of meaning in the movie.<br />
<br />
I found WwN (I&#039;ll refer to the movie as Watashi wa Neko) from searching for as many movies as possible. I decided to watch WwN because it has cats in it; I absolutely love cats, therefore my review may be a little (VERY) biased (I in fact had a cat (Tia) in my lap while watching). Before watching, I didn&#039;t read the synopsis, it&#039;s up to you whether you read the synopsis

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419476">
        before reading.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
Romance is one of the biggest genres, in my opinion, WwN is primarily romance. The story is very easy to follow and can be watched by any age, even if they don&#039;t understand the story. WwN&#039;s story had many turns where the plot shifted a little, which felt forced, but really I don&#039;t mind because it&#039;s a beautiful story.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
I&#039;m not an art fanatic by any means, nor do I understand art. For me, art just needs to be clear and understandable, which WwN does puurfectly. The lines have a nice thickness that isn&#039;t too thick or thin.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
I didn&#039;t really notice the sound because I was very involved with the story. The voice actors sounded like they enjoyed their roles. I didn&#039;t notice the music for even a second, but I&#039;m sure it helped make each scene more intense, or any other thing music does to a scene. I guess this is where I should say I watched in the sub, which I think is generally the better option when it comes to Ghibli films.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
Each and every character feels real in WwN, they all have emotions and values. Something WwN did that I noticed was they slowly gave you more information about the characters. I found it very easy to remember every character&#039;s name, even the side characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
Here are my expectations prior to watching: &quot;This is probably another good idea with forced romance and romance-related cliches.&quot; I was sorely mistaken as I had forgotten it was a Ghibli film. WwN did a perfect job at involving me in the story, which I think would happen to most viewers. Certainly everyone can easily enjoy this movie.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
How can the overall not be 10/10 when everything else is 10/10? This movie is a must-watch for me, it only takes 104 minutes to watch (that&#039;s with credits). As of writing this review, WwN is #642 in popularity and #2125 in average score which is absurd. Who has been giving a score less than 8, I&#039;ll fight you! (current avg score is 7.35)<br />
<br />
Have a good day reader, I hope my review helped you decide on whether or not you will watch Nakitai Watashi wa Neko wo Kaburu / A Whisker Away.<br />
<br />
P.S. I JUST REALISED THIS MOVIE AIRED ON JUNE 18th 2020! In my opinion anime in general have been getting a lot worse, the fact that this masterpiece was made just over a year ago is simply amazing! Kudos to Studio Ghibli &lt;3

    My name is Miyo Sasaki. I&#039;m 12 years old. My mom doesn&#039;t exist, she walked out on me, and I&#039;m married to Kento Hinode. I go to middle school, and I get home every day by 4 PM at the latest. I don&#039;t smoke, but I occasionally turn into a cat. I&#039;m never in bed, and make sure to stalk my crush husband for 8 hours, no matter what. After having my brain wrinkles ironed out and doing about twenty minutes of Hinode sunrise attacks before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I have zero sense

        of others&#039; feelings. I was told there were major issues at my last therapy session. I&#039;m trying to explain that I&#039;m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like empathy or reason, that would cause me to act rationally. That is how I deal with love, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to think, the movie would end.

    TLDR: A fun movie with good worldbuilding, characters, and storyline. It has its flaws, but if all you want is a good, fun movie to watch and relax to, I definitely recommend watching this Ghibli-esque movie<br />
<br />
Having watched the trailer weeks before, along with Studio Colorido&#039;s other work Penguin Highway, which I also massively enjoyed, I was tremendously excited to see what this movie had to offer. Although I must be honest and was kind of worried that this movie wouldn&#039;t live up to the hype, I am proud to say that this film had met my very high expectations.<br />
<br />
And as MAL requires me to, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344385">
        will write a review based on the five components of this movie.<br />
<br />
Story (8/10): <br />
<br />
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the story and premise of the film. Whenever I see movies, the first thing I look for is whether or not the setting of the story blends well with the conflict. I examine whether the fantasy makes sense within the context of the story and doesn&#039;t make me question &quot;how can that happen if....&quot; But I have to praise this film because the magic within the setting makes sense, and I didn&#039;t have a lot of questions about the &quot;realism&quot; of the fantasy. The only real problem I had was about the cat character designs and why Muge physically looked like a cat, even in the tree world, and the other cats looked like humanoid-cat beings. But besides that, the fantasy was well thought out, and I have to praise the story writers for making the magic &quot;realistic.&quot;<br />
<br />
As for the plot, the beginning of the movie was well-paced with how Muge and Kento&#039;s relationship blossomed between cat/girl and boy. The conflict was also enjoyable to the point where I was apprehensive that Muge and Kento would never be together as humans. The solution was also well-played out because the two characters struggled to get Muge (and eventually Kento) back into their human forms. The only problem I had was how everything was so convenient to the point that it felt unrealistic. Like how Kento was able to cross over the bridge even though he wasn&#039;t a cat? Kind of laughable. <br />
<br />
As for the plot, the movie builds the romance between Muge and Kento&#039;s exceptionally well to them, eventually dating. Their shared moments on screen were excellent, and they had terrific chemistry with each other. Although I can see why Kento fell in love with Muge because of the progression of the story, I never really understood how Muge fell in love with Kento. All the movie shows us is that &quot;he&#039;s cute&quot; and &quot;he has a sexy voice.&quot; But that&#039;s it. They probably couldn&#039;t explain this because of runtime, but I wished I could have seen why she was so head-over-heels over him.<br />
<br />
I also had a problem with the parent dynamics for Muge and Kento. I was invested within the mom/stepmom dynamic with Muge, where the two motherly figures were fighting over custody. I was interested to see how that would play out, but the movie never seemed to resolve it in any way. The only purpose for having it in the film was to prove Muge was always smiling even though she was in pain. I wished the studio could have fleshed that out, but that is pretty unrealistic from a 104-minute film. As for Kento, we learn early on that his father died. But that fact has no real significance in the entire movie except to address the fact that he is dead. His dynamic with his sister also has no significance within the whole film, although his mother had some conflict with him because she thought he needs to study a lot to support the family. That was probably the only exciting thing about Kento&#039;s family, and it left a lot to be desired.<br />
<br />
But overall, the setting was well-thought-out. The main story was realistic and resolved in a well-deserved manner, while I wished the side stories were more fleshed out.<br />
<br />
Art (7/10)<br />
<br />
As for the art, having already seen Studio Colorido&#039;s work on Penguin Highway, it left a lot to be desired. Penguin Highway&#039;s artwork with the town and the ocean beyond were phenomenal. The animation work in that movie was also as breathtaking as the art, especially when the woman (literally how she&#039;s referred to in the film) and Aoyama were on the flock of penguins zooming across town. <br />
<br />
The artwork wasn&#039;t as spectacular as Penguin Highway, but I was impressed at how well-drawn the cat sanctuary was. But the tree place kind of reminded me of the Land of the Dead from &quot;Coco,&quot; and after remembering that it made the cat sanctuary look like a discount Land of the Dead. The setting wasn&#039;t bad in any shape or form, but it was kind of disappointing.<br />
<br />
As for the characters, I liked their non-vibrant, realistic designs. The people had realistic looks for Japanese people (except for Kento&#039;s blonde sister, of course), and that made this movie unique where the anime world is filled with extravagant human character designs. It was refreshing to see characters in a more toned-down, realistic form. <br />
<br />
What impressed me were the cat designs. I liked all the cat designs, especially Muge and the Mask Dealer. Muge had to stand out as an adorable cat, which the studio did correctly, and the Mask Dealer had a &quot;spirit&quot; vibe to him that worked well with his Buddha-resembling art.<br />
<br />
Overall, the artwork for this movie was good. The setting was not wrong in any means but was just kind of disappointing while the characters were well-drawn. <br />
<br />
Sound (6/10)<br />
<br />
The biggest problem I had with this movie was the sound. Although the two songs played as ending sequences were good (kudos to Yorushika) and fit well within the story, I didn&#039;t really like some of the inappropriately placed sound effects within the movie. For example, when the mother and stepmother were fighting about Muge, the light-hearted music in the background that indicated something funny was going on didn&#039;t sit well with me. It was a painful scene, for me honestly, and I wish the studio took the issue of that more seriously (more on that later within characters.) <br />
<br />
There were some other instances where music was inappropriately used, but most times, sounds were used effectively throughout the movie.<br />
<br />
Characters (7/10)<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with Muge, the protagonist. She is definitely a good character and protagonist within the story, although she can basically be described as &quot;a superficial happy girl who&#039;s hurt inside.&quot; Her personality is evident as a confident girl, and I enjoyed who she was as a person. Her role in Kento&#039;s character development is well-thought-out, which further proves why Kento would love her. Although, as I stated before, I can&#039;t understand why she was so in love with Kento, she is an excellent protagonist with good intentions and a cheerful personality.<br />
<br />
Next, we have the male protagonist, Kento. I loved his character development as he learned to love Muge and embrace who he is because of Muge. Kento was the most compelling character within this movie as he starts as a timid person we see at the beginning of the film to the confident boy who learns to embrace himself at the end of it. <br />
<br />
The Mask Dealer, as an antagonist, is an interesting character because he was a deity in this movie. He grants people and cats the power to transform between each other in exchange for some of their lifespans so he can live longer. His motives make sense, and he doesn&#039;t come across as necessarily evil throughout the story. The only part was at the end when he basically monologues to Kento and Muge about how he wanted their lifespans to live longer and acts in desperation to get their lifespans. The Mask Dealer seemed really cheesy in the end and his intentions stayed constant from start to finish. I wished he had some character development where he sees the love between Muge and Kento and voluntarily gives their lifespans back, but oh well.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast was pretty forgettable. The friends had no real purpose in the story and probably could have been removed with no real effect. But as I stated before, I wish the parents of Muge and Kento were fleshed out more to bring more conflict to the story. But since this is a movie about the romance between two people, I can&#039;t complain. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8/10)<br />
<br />
Even though I basically critiqued this movie&#039;s bad parts pretty harshly, I cannot say that this was a bad movie. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie, a wholesome and interesting romance story between a catgirl and a boy. Although I didn&#039;t enjoy it as much as I did Penguin Highway, I am satisfied with what Studio Colorido created as a stand-alone film. The story was fun; the setting makes sense, and what can I say? I enjoyed this film! It deserved the hype it did, and I can&#039;t wait to see how Studio Colorido puts out next!<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 7/10<br />

    When I first saw the trailer for this anime, I was had very high expectations for this movie, which it managed to meet perfectly. It was such a touching story and heavily reminded me of Ghibli movies I used to watch when I was younger.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
To me, this anime was highly original and very well done. The pacing was perfect, it wasn&#039;t too fast or too slow. The story itself was very emotional and beautiful, I managed to feel Muge&#039;s struggles strongly and it left a very impactful message on me about battling depression and how to be yourself.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
I feel like the animation let

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344326">
        the anime down a little, as it was quite choppy and not amazing at times, however the actual style and beautiful scenery made up for it. It&#039;s breath-taking at times.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
The music and the atmosphere really brings the movie together. I love how it portrayed. The songs were really beautiful and made me very emotional.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
I feel like a lot of people will dislike the protagonist due to her personality, however to me she is extremely likable and like nothing I have ever seen from a protagonist before. She is very unique and I love her a lot; I really felt her pain. Hinode as well was an amazing character, they both felt very realistic and they could definitely fit into a real life scenario. All of the characters were portrayed really well, everyone was different from each other. I feel like the bullies could have been more fleshed out, as they appeared as quickly as they left, however apart from this everyone was perfectly made.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
I thoroughly enjoyed the entire thing from start to finish, nothing was out of place and I would definitely suggest this to anyone who likes Ghibli movies especially. It made me extremely emotional and it really hit me hard, I am definitely going to rewatch it over and over!!<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10

    I was extremely excited for this movie since it gave off similar vibes to Kimi no Nawa and Studio Ghibli movies. This entire movie was basically a knock off of the cat returns but replace the main character with the most unnecessarily annoying, energetic, clingy, and stalkerish girl. None of the characters motives really make sense since character development is poor in my opinion. Nothing about this movie was special and if you want a cat anime there are PLENTY of others you could watch without wasting your time on this. I&#039;d give this a higher rating since it wasn&#039;t as appalling as some other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349416">
        anime I have seen but the fact that this is so painfully similar to the Cat Returns makes this not even worth giving pity points.
