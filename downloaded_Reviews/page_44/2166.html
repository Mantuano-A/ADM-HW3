        they&#039;re those guys on anime that lives just to attract females, so guys are welcome to watch this josei anime with peace.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you don&#039;t like slow-paced, quiet shows, and dislike works without much action, then Ristorante Paradiso will surely disappoint you. It&#039;s a story for people who like the quieter, more peaceful side of life and anime.<br />
<br />
-Story<br />
Ristorante Paradiso is all about a restaurant, somewhere in Rome, with its employess consisting of lots of aged men with glasses. Then, enter Nicoletta into the picture, and the restaurant&#039;s never the same again. Don&#039;t get me wrong though. The show has this quiet atmosphere that makes you feel like you&#039;re at the restaurant as well, eating its delicious delicacies.<br />
<br />
-Art<br />
Old people ahoy! The anime&#039;s full of the art consisting of old people&#039;s faces. It defies the usual standard that you need a sexy/moe/whatever type of character design for the anime to work. Anyway, the art is okay, with its dreamy-like colors and all. But the food! They drew it well!<br />
<br />
-Sound<br />
Listen to the opening song and agree with me: the music is well-thought of. It meshed well with the overall theme of the anime: slow-paced slice-of-life. The background music gets it right with the scenes.<br />
<br />
-Characters<br />
Ristorante Paradiso&#039;s working point is its characters. Each one of them (from the weird Gigi to the old Luciano) has a story of their own, and it worked well with the overall feel. From the beginning, you&#039;d wonder what kind of people works at the restaurant; don&#039;t worry, everyone will be focused on.<br />
<br />
-Enjoyment<br />
I really enjoyed watching this. The combination of the setting (Rome), characters, and good food, makes this show worthwhile. But, as I&#039;ve said, it&#039;s for people who enjoys quiet anime, so it really depends on your preference if you&#039;ll enjoy this or not.<br />
<br />
-Overall<br />
Can&#039;t say much more; it made my day. Imperfect, yes, but it is a worthy slice-of-life anime, so go try it. Contrary to the common belief, it&#039;s not shoujo; it&#039;s josei, intended for an older, more mature audience. Not that there&#039;s anything wrong with it, but you&#039;ll appreciate it more if you&#039;re old enough to understand how elder people&#039;s minds works. And, this anime&#039;s not limited to women. Men can appreciate it as well.

    When I started this series, it was more over me just flipping through random anime and going hey why not and watching the first ep. After watching the first ep I was strangely captivated by all of the characters in the anime. Each character had a distinct feature about them, but at the same time many of the characters could be thought as similar.<br />
<br />
This is not a anime for people who like fast paced action in my opinion, but instead made for simple relaxation and enjoyment. <br />
<br />
You learn about the characters as the story continues, and through multiple stories, a bigger picture is created.<br />
<br />
I would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16345">
        say that this anime is either a hit or miss with people, ya love it or ya don&#039;t. <br />
<br />
To all people out their though I would say to most certainly give this anime a try. <br />
<br />
For 11 episodes I was completely satisfied, except for the never ending wish for more.<br />
<br />
This anime is for both males and females a like, I don&#039;t believe one group would prefer it over another, its an acquired taste tbh.

    &quot;A mysterious restaurant is on a road just a little ways from the center of Rome.&quot;<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
The plot revolves around a group of older looking men, who work at a restaurant called &quot;Casetta Dell’orso&quot;. Each worker wears eye glasses when they are on duty. And this in fact is what makes the restaurant stand out from the others in Rome. One day the staff gets greeted by a women from America, who in turn comes to them wanting to train with the crew. As the anime progresses, each member of the cast is brought in the spotlight, and gets there own in depth story as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21393">
        to how they ended up working there, along with other interesting tid-bits. It does stay linear in this aspect, but brings so many different unique twists on everyone’s story, that most shouldn’t mind this fact. Now because this anime is more of a slow paced down to earth story, everything in it’s plot is very realistic. And a lot of the drama that is brought to the table comes in the form of relationships, complicated family issues, to mixed feeling among characters. All of this is knitted very well together to make quite a compelling and deep storyline. Even though Nicolette is the main character of the story, they all get well balanced scenes, which is good as there is nobody in this that will ever leave the viewer with a big black question mark as to who they are. So be prepared for lots of dialog in this. Now not everything in this will please viewers. As mentioned earlier, the story is quite slow paced, and there really is no over all big plot to this anime. Simply put, it’s a story about life in a restaurant, and I actually found it quite dissapointing that the restaurant theme wasn’t used to it’s fullest. So don’t expect to get any kind of explanation as to how certain dishes are prepared, as the story is more character driven than anything else. Which isn’t a bad thing really, since they really do turn out to be the backbone of this anime. The ending is quite fitting, and should satisfy most.<br />
<br />
Regarding possible offensive material. Ristorante Paradiso contains very little in this aspect. There are occasional suggestive situations, but they are done in a quite tasteful manner, never for show. The only thing I would say that some viewers might find a bit disturbing, is that the main lead female Nicoletta, shows attraction to men that are old enough to be her father.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
The music track really shines in this. You get the traditional tracks one would hear if they were in Paris, Italy and of course...Rome. The opening theme is quite relaxing, as is the ending theme, and actually does mix well with it’s environment’s theme. Voice acting is also quite good. All character voice are done with maturity and calm, and really do bring the characters to life. Overall, it’s quite an endearing soundtrack.<br />
<br />
Animation: 7/10<br />
This was the only real thing I didn’t like about the anime, it just didn’t feel like the animation was up to par regarding what it could have been. Quite a bit of the color scheme is pretty bland at times. Some may argue that it was done purposely in order to create a certain style to the anime. Regardless though, it still has a nice amount of detail to it. Case in point: being that the cast is of different style ages right? And the artists really worked over time to make sure that the characters looked their appropriate age. All the male characters look like they really are in their 40s and 50s. While others, such as Nicolette, appear to be in their 20’s. So while the animation is by no means pushing any boundaries, it’s still nice to look at, and detailed in the places you would want it to be..<br />
<br />
Characters: 9/10<br />
As mentioned earlier, each member gets his or her own spotlighted episode. Considering that this is only an 11 episode series, you wouldn’t expect this to have much depth to it. Surprisingly though it does, and the best compliment I can give the cast, is that you really are able to get into their heads, and with many you can even read their thoughts. They have a good amount of layers to their personality, and you will want to push on in the show just to see why a certain character acts a certain way, as little tid-bits are explained as things progress. There was one draw back to this category though, and that comes in the form of Nicolette herself. At the beginning I was expecting her to really develop over the course of the series, and while she did have a bit of development to her, it really wasn’t much. As she tended to just remain in the background &quot;observing&quot; the other cast of character’s lives, and ended up feeling more like a prop to the series. Even still, a wonderful memorable cast that feel interesting, yet down to earth at the same time.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
If you are looking for a deep and relaxing slice of life anime with a nice pace to it, then you will enjoy Ristorante Paradiso. While it might disappoint some that were expecting a series that centers around food, it still has a lot to offer the viewer who can appreciate it&#039;s plot and themes. So if you were looking for your next anime entree, then your appetite is about to be fed!

    This is an excellent choice for those, who like slow paced and emotionally upbringing anime,are more or less interested in the different layers of human nature, and of course...love.<br />
<br />
First of all, although the story takes place in Rome, there is nothing of the so called &#039;&#039;normal Italian behaviour&#039;&#039; No loud (more or less) voices, overreacted emotional outbursts etc.BUT there is lots of gorgeous food (I&#039;m also living in Europe,so those are things Italians are considerably famous for xD)<br />
The main storyline is about a girl named Nicoletta, who comes to Rome from the countryside, chasing after her mother Olga, who is married to an eccentric (?)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14442">
        man. He owns a little restaurant by the name &quot;Ristorante casetta dell&#039;orso&quot; <br />
Olga is desperately trying to keep the fact, that Nicoletta is her daughter from anyone, especially - her new husband. So, as the events evolve, Nicoletta founds herself working in this strange restaurant, where all the waiters and chefs are  elderly (gentlemen) men with glasses (so the place is always full of female customers).<br />
Of course, the other main storyline must be Nicolettas struggles to find her own place in the new and unknown world, something to live for and , the most interesting (in my opinion)is her crush on one of the waiters(ignoring the age difference).<br />
<br />
I really like the art style, because it helps to relax from all the bubbly looking, or on the contrary - over feminine women in most of other anime i have seen. The lines and colours are well balanced, so the background is near to ideal. The art style, well...not everyone will appreciate it, but it would just be so because of the stereotypes, how anime should look like.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is really good and adequate. It is an essential part for the creation of the right mood. The tunes are soothing, just like the ones you would hear, having a meal in a very good restaurant with live performers.The Op and Ed are nice as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
The  episodes were definitely worth watching, as the plot  unfolds. <br />
The reasons for doing something, exploring ones abilities, all of it makes the story and the characters actions believable. Especially, considering our fast lifestyle, for some, this anime could be a good chance to sit down, relax and think over some actions  (at least, I&#039;m in the same age as her and stuck with the same  uncertainty --&gt; what do I really want to do with my life? )<br />
<br />
Actually, I didn&#039;t want to over exaggerate, so I gave this show a balanced 8 . I am assured, everyone can take full enjoyment from watching it, ignoring the gender (but, possibly, not the characteristic preferences).<br />
<br />
 So, if you are interested in an evolving story with not so common characters, dialogues and drawing style, Ristorante paradiso is anime, which should definitely be at least  on your &#039;&#039;plan to watch&#039;&#039; list. <br />

    Time to go and enjoy ourselves with a subtle anime, but exquisite for the palate. A rather simple but enjoyable drama, filled with a pleasant atmosphere. Well, that was the flavor that this small production left me. Let us begin!<br />
<br />
Ristorante Paradiso is an anime series of 11 episodes made in 2009, adapted from the homonymous sleeve of Natsume Ono. The premise tells the story of Nicoletta, a 21 year old girl who travels to Rome to face her mother, who left her abandoned since she was a child. After locating her, she notices that the woman owns, along with her new husband, a small but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review238232">
        popular restaurant called Casetta dell&#039;Orso, characterized by having a staff of pure older men (over fifty or reaching age) Who have a marked appeal and a label that makes them extremely popular among Italian ladies who frequent, alone or with partner, the restaurant. This decision was made because of the fascination of the owner for men with glasses. During the development of the series, the young Nicoletta will not only meet the restaurant staff, but will discover more about her mother and, incidentally, meet the man who will captivate his heart in the process: The handsome Saint Claudio Paradiso.<br />
<br />
So ... How&#039;s it going? It&#039;s good? It is bad? Is it cliché? Is it a masterpiece? ... let&#039;s see ...<br />
<br />
As for the positives, I would say that, first of all, the characters. The way the story introduces you to each of the gentlemen who make up the restaurant, as well as Nicoletta and his mother, characters of support and others, is extremely efficient and subtle, getting to know each one in a pleasant, without Mention that they are extremely endearing and friendly. It is very easy to feel empathy for the protagonist, who is extremely charismatic and fun to watch, both in moments of mild humor and moments of emphatic drama. The gentlemen of the staff are characters, so simple, great. It makes you want to become your colleague. Each one has characterizations that make them distinctive and empathic with the viewer, and although many enjoy being stereotypes of handsome men of anime, they know how to carry the baton of the same without this being made heavy or annoying. On the other hand, and this is something that is peculiar to me, but great after all, I was surprised to see that the characters who would be in charge of the female viewers who saw this anime, were older men. I considered it one of the coolest twists I&#039;ve seen in an anime of this style, since it is already extremely trite and annoying to meet the typical group of young students sculpted by Michelangelo, with unbearable personality, fastidiously bishonen and, why Not, insufferably perfect.<br />
<br />
These are very nice to see; Have the voice of experience on your side. They are married, widowed or divorced, but never willing to fall into childish students. The mangaka responsible for this work knows what he is working with and does not make them fall into stupid temptations. They are older men and behave as such without losing that charismatic brightness that makes them sympathetic to the audience that sees this story. They are gentlemen, humorous, have their character but also good heart, face situations with maturity; But also have internal conflicts that do not find how to solve the first ... in short, they are characters with such a human level of being, it is a great experience to meet each cast member.<br />
<br />
Visually, the animation is beautiful. The characters have a good level of animation and the dishes are a delight to watch, not to mention that the lighting works on each plane give you that sophisticated atmosphere that makes you want to see this anime while you sip a rich cup of tea or coffee with the Pinky bow and wearing suit and tie. The music is beautiful, according to the rhythm of the story, it is subtle, elegant, soft ... almost as if it were part of the very life of the story, and it was not a simple arrangement to add extra feeling to what is occurring.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, we have a great diversity of couples, as well as the romantic element, which is ... My God, great, exquisite. Each cast member has a love story to tell, or a dramatic moment to highlight, that are of a splendid level in narrative terms. On the other hand, Nicoletta and Claudio have an enviable chemistry. The charismatic and active personality of Nicoletta contrasts too well with the passivity and calm of Claudius, making a perfect equation as far as loving reciprocity. In addition, the final scene, when Claudio finally decides to respond to the feelings of his beloved Nicoletta, is one of the most beautiful &quot;confession&quot; scenes I&#039;ve seen in a drama or romance anime. It is not a kiss Hollywood, but a simple gesture; But sincere, tender and loaded with an insurmountable emotional aura. Just to see how Claudio puts his hand on Nicoletta&#039;s head while she cries with happiness and that beautiful tune of violin sounds at the bottom of the scene, captivated my heart to 1000%, being one of the most beautiful moments that I have witnessed in the Genre of drama in anime and manga.<br />
<br />
Ok, apparently, this anime is a beautiful experience ... but like every review I make ... well ...<br />
<br />
This anime has a few problems that are worth highlighting. First, it must be said that animation, while beautiful, has its negative counterparts. The majority of scenarios and objects that are seen on screen are generated by computer, which gives us an idea that this anime was made with a very limited budget, shortening the possibilities of having a true visual spectacle. Of course, this may be omitted; But the fact is that, in many cases, the computer scenarios, and the use of this technique in some peculiar things, like the tea or the clarified coffee in the cups, were an extremely distracting element, and that, therefore, no Allowed me to enjoy the visual experience to the level I wanted. Perhaps he is very punctilious in that regard; But what can I say? If you really love a dish, you should ask for it with the best to enjoy it to the maximum, not to settle for a simple overheated cold and without charisma.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I felt that the series did not have time to develop ... I felt short, incomplete and with much to explore. In the first place, Nicoletta&#039;s conflict with her mother was solved very abruptly, without even a truly acceptable development, hanging from the mantle of forgiveness and instant compassion. Excuse me, but we&#039;re talking about a mother who abandoned her daughter for several years. Overcoming a resentment of that caliber is not something that is solved from one day to the other, even if the woman did not do it with bad intentions. Everything is based on a process almost in the style of Deux Ex Machina for Nicoletta to &quot;mature&quot; and show unconditional love to her mother despite, I repeat and emphasize, having left her alone for many years under the care of her grandmother. I don&#039;t know, maybe it is me, but this conflict lacked structure, sense ... in short, it lacked a good development.<br />
<br />
This could be because the production is only 11 episodes and has a huge casting of characters to pose, so it does not give time to grant a reasonably good development to all members of each part of the story; Because yes, this not only affects Nicoletta and his mother, but the rest of characters, who, despite everything, we did not finish knowing. Claudio&#039;s past, for example, was very lazy. They did not really explain what was happening with him, as well as his passive attitude with any millionaire woman who wanted to taste a private role with him, even if he did not want that ... well, the thing is that the series was extremely short For all it had to offer. There was so much to explore, and nothing was accomplished 100% satisfactory. Maybe it was because the very members of David Productions and Fuji TV were not very enthusiastic about the idea of ​​doing a long series, or at least 22 episodes, based on this manga.<br />
<br />
Well, despite everything, Ristorante Paradiso I found a very good series. It has moments that, despite the problems, manage to get ahead, making it one of those small productions that is worth seeing above any pessimistic expectations. It is fun, it is elegant, it is entertaining, it has wonderful characters, it is sweetly romantic and with a light, sophisticated and beautiful atmosphere that will make you, sooner or later, want to see it again.<br />
<br />
I personally would go back to this restaurant over and over and over and over and over again.

    **This review was written after watching the first episode**<br />
<br />
&quot;The mysterious restaurant on a street near the centre of Rome&quot;<br />
<br />
With these words, the viewer is brought into the world of a quaint little eating place, as seen through the eyes of the young protagonist, Nicoletta.<br />
<br />
The first thing that will strike you as you watch Ristorante Paradiso is probably the art. The character designs, especially the two ladies, are just about as different as you can get from the usual pretty anime girls. The 2 female characters, when seen from the front, have unfortunately masculine facial structures, and to be honest, the overly wide mouths and slight

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14325">
        creases about their eyes and mouth were rather distracting despite my best efforts to ignore them. On the other hand, the males in the show were pretty well-drawn, even though I&#039;m not a great fan of the &#039;bespectacled men&#039; archetype.<br />
<br />
However, art goes beyond just character designs, and it is in the backgrounds that Ristorante Paradiso truly shines. As Nicoletta toured the city of Rome, the sights and the cityscape were rendered beautifully in a soft pastel palette. I&#039;m no student of art, but I found that they resembled watercolour paintings, which managed to convey the quiet, historic ambience that I associate with Rome. Taking the previous points into consideration, I&#039;ve given Ristorante a 7 for art.<br />
<br />
The next thing that you may notice is the background soundtrack. Again, this is somewhat hard to describe, but it mainly consists of cool jazzy tunes where the   melody is mainly carried by the piano, and supported by violin. The music really helped to set the mood of the events, all the while making you feel like you&#039;re sitting in a quiet little cafe, relaxing with a cup of tea (or coffee) in your hand. The opening and ending themes also matched well with the tone set by the soundtrack, so no complaints there.<br />
<br />
Having only watched 1 episode, there isn&#039;t much I can say about the story or characters so far. However, what has been revealed of the story and the restaurant&#039;s premise so far has been interesting (no spoilers here), and enough has been shown of Nicoletta&#039;s past to make her actions and motivations believable. The cast is also suitably varied in terms of personality and promises some rather interesting relationships to develop.<br />
<br />
Overall, if you enjoy the slice-of-life genre, you&#039;ll probably enjoy Ristorante Paradiso. Try to look beyond the somewhat odd character designs and you&#039;ll probably be fine. On the other hand, if you&#039;re looking for an action-packed, fast-paced anime, you&#039;re looking in the wrong place. Finally, while the large cast of men in the show may turn some male viewers off, being a guy myself, I can assure you that this is an anime that viewers of both gender can enjoy.<br />

    **Dont READ if ur a fan o-o**<br />
This anime could probably relate more to females, so if ur male.....don&#039;t watch it cus u&#039;ll mostlikely hate it (just relalized it was a shoujo and i have no right really to say this... but o well i took 10 mins to vent.)<br />
<br />
<br />
This anime is a real let down. Im not real picky when it comes to anime. I can mostly watch anything without complaining but this just made me cring left and right.  At first when i first saw it i thought &quot;ooh this seems like a interesting show&quot;. Yea it was interesting alright... No offence but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14260">
        this anime looks like crap...if u think differently feel free to message me to change my opinion about this. If u think my opinion is bias...it probably is but i can say the same that the art doesn&#039;t always need to be all big eyes, and flashy colors but don&#039;t make the characters &quot;ugly&quot; unless ur trying to prove a point<br />
<br />
The art in this show makes me want to puke..... all the people look like Men, even the women. This is the main reason why i thought this series was horrible. I couldn&#039;t concentrate at all on what they were saying. <br />
<br />
The story really just rushes into things not helping understand what the heck is going on. Though i thought that the story could go somewhere.<br />
<br />
The background music was pretty well decided. It gives off the feeling of....well Rome if that says anything.<br />
<br />
The Characters were all ...unique. Other than the aspect that they all look like men when the story seems to revole around a girl. Each character was drawn differently unlike some anime where it seems like the characters were cloned with different hair colors.<br />
<br />
I did not enjoy this series really. it would have been better if not for the Art. <br />
<br />
A few thoughts to improve this show would to ONE: slow down the plot so that people that havent read the manga can understand what the hecks happenin and TWO: Find a Better Artist or change the focus off the Women of this show. If he focused on the men of this show instead of one girl it would&#039;ve made a difference.<br />
<br />
If u think the same click the Helpful button to show that im not the only one that thinks this....i hope more people think the same.<br />
Another reason why i might not like this anime is because its shoujo......i feel stupid right now... o well still doesn&#039;t change the way i feel about this anime =P<br />
Sry if i ruined some first impressions for some people (girls).

    Story.<br />
Granted, an 11 episode show can&#039;t have that intricate a story, but I found that the heroine&#039;s &quot;journey,&quot; which should have been the main plot, was overwhelmed by all the secondary character&#039;s subplots.  We learn little of her childhood, her education, or her reasons for suddenly deciding to come to Rome to meet her mother.  The resolution with her mother, which should have been the climax and dominated the final two episodes, was like a footnote in the story.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
One of the show&#039;s strongest elements.  Not just the character design but the overall depiction of Rome were very well done.  The way

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21177">
        the &quot;camera&quot; sometimes panned around to show what the characters were actually seeing was a nice touch.  A lot of attention was given to make the restaurant seem warm and the food delicious.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
I hated the intro.  The rest was all right; it didn&#039;t detract or add.  There wasn&#039;t a single theme that caught my attention and made me think, &quot;This is really lovely.&quot;  Decent ending theme though.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
Pretty carefully developed characters.  The heroine was naive, but likable, and she grew during the course of the story.  The people she worked with also had detailed back stories.  I can&#039;t say I found any of them interesting, though.  A smaller cast, more episodes, or more &quot;current&quot; events and fewer flashbacks, might have helped. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
It&#039;s relaxing to watch, but the show only had two elements that kept me engaged: the love interest and the painful relationship between the mother and daughter.  Neither delivered.  The love story between the heroine and older man wasn&#039;t convincing.  They didn&#039;t have great chemistry and I was surprised when I realized he was actually the real love interest, and not a crush along the way to the real hero.  The other disappointment was how little attention was given to the relationship between the girl and her mother.  The heroine was abandoned at an early age by her mother, so her mother could marry a man (who didn&#039;t know she had a daughter).  It wasn&#039;t for financial reasons either, just that the mother loved him and he&#039;d told her he wouldn&#039;t marry a divorcee.  Despite this, the heroine&#039;s resentment tapers off fast.  As for the mother, I know it&#039;s a light josei anime and that there has to be a happily ever after ending, but she sure got off easy.  Finally, about the heroine&#039;s reasoning along the way--&quot;Well, now I&#039;m in love so as a woman I get why you did it&quot;--sorry, but no matter how much you like a guy, you don&#039;t ditch your kid.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
Okay show if you don&#039;t think about it too hard I guess.  Definitely has themes I disagree with though, about a parent&#039;s responsibility and how when your husband cheats on you, you&#039;ve just got to remind him how much he loves you.

    First off I have to say that this slice of life anime, in my perspective, was absolutely amazing. Not only does it cover a unique, unpopular theme, enrapturing a young female MC who is surrounded by older, mature, middle-aged men, it also brings the viewers to see the element of romance and restaurants in another light.<br />
<br />
I chose to make my first review for this anime because it was one of the only ones till date that really amazed me beyond words. The story: in my opinion, was extremely creative. There were so many themes I was not familiar with but the way the story played

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335190">
        out really made me feel engaged with them after a while.<br />
<br />
I started watching this anime uninterested, only because I had no other anime to watch, but it ended up becoming one of the anime I liked best.<br />
<br />
The art: though not exactly extravagant, is really relaxing. After two episodes I found myself getting used to it. I guess the only problem I have with the art are the 3D scenes at some point, and the way the mouths are drawn. However this shouldn’t hinder the quality of the anime overall.<br />
<br />
Sound: incredibly relaxing. The sounds, background music went extremely well with each scene, slow; pretty; romantic; it was classically relaxing.<br />
<br />
Character: Nicoletta, as the female MC, was sketched out really well. We could understand her feelings towards her mother. The backstories provided for the other characters really helped a lot, too, to get us to be more familiar with them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: no complaints here; the romantic atmosphere, the restaurant’s theme, the way everything slowly, slowly, but surely, develops; every character, theme, behavior, influenced the anime in the most positive way; at least to me.<br />
<br />
Overall: I can say that I absolutely loved this anime. Slice of life isn’t really my type of genre but this one really captured my attention and influenced me to try more slice of life anime. I guess this is another reason why I think this anime is outstanding. It’s relaxing, it’s made for mature audiences; and I am confident that both men and women may enjoy this anime.<br />

    --WIP Review -- <br />
<br />
Ristorante Paradiso was an interesting little series. It&#039;s strongest points were the art style, which had broad European features to match the ethnicity of the characters. It was very interesting to see from this perspective and I very much enjoyed this style of animation and colour.<br />
<br />
Along with the art style, the characters were one of the best parts of the series. I was particularly stricken with Gigi as he reminded me of a curious and quiet cat, but each one was interesting in their own ways. <br />
<br />
While it was  beautifully animated and had talented seiyuu, it&#039;s weakest point was  definitely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review165225">
        the music. I did not feel as though the OP and end themes fit the style or mood of this series at all, and the whole end sequence was so banal I just skipped it after the first viewing and the OP, although nicely animated, was generally skipped as well because I didn&#039;t enjoy the pop ballad the studio chose for the theme. The sound wasn&#039;t bad and fit the feeling of a ristorante, but the music just did not move me at all. :(<br />
<br />
I was also disappointed that there was not more food in the series. There were a few scenes or episodes that kind of hinted at food and a couple that were kind of about food, but really there was more talk of being a cook/chef then emphasis on the food itself. It was terribly done, but I&#039;ve certainly seen other anime do a better job of it (such as Antique Bakery) and it would have been nice to have seen a day at the market episode or one that was dedicated to flavours. One episode came pretty close, though in the end it was still more about being a chef and the relationships of the staff than really about the food, but it was close enough.<br />
<br />
Overall, this was a nice little anime and it could easily been an 8 or 9, despite how predictable the plot was and the lack of emphasis on the food (NOT enough food porn for a Restaurant/cooking anime!), had they thought to pay more attention to the music.

    I love Japanese food, but Italian cuisine is the greatest. That&#039;s the reason why I picked this anime to watch and it was a pleasant watch. I also must admit that I&#039;m actually a bisexual and the males are pretty hot. Ahem, let&#039;s get back to the review.<br />
<br />
Ristorante Paradiso is a fascinating josei slice-of-life work that is both enchantingly slow-paced and colorful in terms of characterization, exemplifying the genre and demographic as a whole. <br />
<br />
The premise is the setting, an Italian restaurant in Rome. What is different about this restaurant is the abundance of spectacled male waitresses and cafes. Of course, these hot bishies, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review50825">
        mean male characters, are not just the main focus of the show; rather, the story is driven by the observations of the female lead character, Nicoletta.<br />
<br />
Thus, we enter Nicoletta&#039;s maturing thinking as she talks to the restaurant employees. There is a huge amount of characterization into all of the characters as Nicoletta learns about the history of both the characters and the history of the restaurant.<br />
<br />
And this is why the pacing is great; it enforces the slice-of-life aspect of the work.<br />
<br />
Works that call themselves slice-of-life try to be humorous. However, josei works have the ability to calm themselves down and focus on realistic relationship dynamics and characterization. Ristorante Paradiso is no exception.<br />
<br />
We get to understand the characters and their problems. Every viewer must have seen this type of character before in their life. The slow pacing through Nicoletta&#039;s observations lets us understand their troubles in life, especially marriage which is a recurring theme in the show.<br />
<br />
Both pacing and characterization lend together and develop a great show with a great cast that all of us can relate to. It is a great character study and worth writing essays about.<br />
<br />
In other aspects, the art is gorgeous. Paintings are used as backgrounds and the characters are strongly contrasted from the background with their bright colors. While they should have varied their color palette (it feels a bit too warm at times), the art is stylistic and beautiful.<br />
<br />
Sound-wise, the show did a great job. There are some great acoustic music playing in the background and some of them are very memorable. I enjoyed the OP jazz music a lot and it really sucks you into the mood.<br />
<br />
That said, there are some problems. The first OP feels a bit too fanservicey and there may be moments that are uncomfortable for male viewers. Any person who has been to at least Europe will know there are some blatant history mistakes; only Japanese people bow, Ristorante Paradiso. It is also vaguely European, not Italian.<br />
<br />
Anyone who enjoyed iyashikei (works like Aria), josei animes, animes with strong characterization, or just willing to watch something different will like Ristorante Paradiso. It is indeed a hidden paradise for anime lovers.

    While I used to live on action anime, I&#039;ve been a bit of a fan of &#039;slice of life&#039; series since watching Welcome to the NHK; this was my hope, and what I was expecting.  I was not disappointed.<br />
<br />
Now I have to say that nothing really &#039;happens&#039; in this series - there are no major events or shocking twists.  This is a true character development series, with most episodes being dedicated to back stories for the restaurant staff.  While it is indeed set in a restaurant, this series really has nothing to do with food, it&#039;s just the setting.<br />
<br />
When I finished this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review58453">
        series, I wanted to go to that restaurant and I wanted to meet those people; that&#039;s the mark of a good series, in my opinion.

    I am not really sure why I decided to watch this anime all the way to the end. I think I was getting really bored with the isekai and action anime that focuses on young protagonists surrounded by waifu material. I wanted to watch an anime with a protagonist who is already lost in adulthood and not sure what to do with him/herself for his/her remaining life span. Nicoletta fits this description almost perfectly. The slow pace of the anime allowed me to enjoy Nicoletta&#039;s insights into the lives of her fellow staff employees and her understanding of how they get by with their years

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303126">
        through life. She uses these insights to help herself have a better understanding of what directions she should take with her own life and let her frustration with her mother (that consumed most of her mind) go. I particularly enjoyed how Nicoletta&#039;s time working in the restaurant allowed her to appreciate the little things that her fellow employees find make their lives feel enjoyable. As the things she begins to appreciate occupy most of her time, she begins to have less time feeling frustrated with her mother. I also like how her fellow staff are all older men who she can turn to for guidance instead of being the same age as her and sharing her dilemmas. This makes her efforts to fit in with the staff feel more endearing since she is going past her comfort zone in working with people she barely knows or understands while keeping a secret of her ties with her mother. No one is going to break the ice for her, she has to figure it out herself. One of the problems I have with the anime is that their is little to  no foreshadowing for the subplots of the other characters. The subplots feel like they just happen to progress the story. For instance Teo isn&#039;t revealed to be frustrated with Nicoletta&#039;s lack of skills until the very end of the anime while Nicoletta&#039;s dilemma on her crush for Claudio is focused on the majority of the anime. I will give the anime credit for Nicoletta trying to see getting together with Claudio as her way of trying to find happiness for herself, but I wish the anime focused more on how she can bring herself happiness by finding a passion in her new career or in a new hobby. I also don&#039;t like how the anime makes romance seem more valuable then making personal connections between people. I don&#039;t think that just because you see a male and female character together with more screen time than any other pairings means that they should be together romantically. It just doesn&#039;t feel authentic that way. Overall this anime was a nice break from the fast mainstream anime and I recommend it for anyone who is getting sick of the isekai genre and just wants to see a story of people coming together and bringing the best out of one another in a fictional place tucked away somewhere in Rome. <br />

    First things first. My &quot;reviews&quot; system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.<br />
------<br />
<br />
✦Story<br />
<br />
It had very relaxing and chill storytelling. This anime gave me a feel of Anime called &quot;Bartender&quot; and a touch of  a &quot;Ikoku Meiro no Croisée The Animation&quot;, which were as well blissful series.<br />
<br />
Story is basically learning about characters in a peaceful tone. As Anime goes on, we learn about each character, their past and state of their love lives. We are also given some so called plot. Meaning this Anime has some &quot;Main story&quot; to it. Regarding the girl who started working at the restaurant

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278789">
        that the Anime is about. And as time passes, we also learn about her, her growth and as well some drama and her love interest.<br />
<br />
Point stays, that the story here was very chill and satisfying. Slice-of-life with thematic and quirks. With a little bit of a Italiano.<br />
<br />
But nevertheless I cannot give it over 7/10 for a very simple reason. It was a relaxing and enjoyable Anime, but I cannot say that the story gave me that extreme amount of a impression that I would rate it higher. I did enjoy it, had its quirks, drama, romance, relaxation, but my gut feeling doesn&#039;t allow it giving any higher. Which means I cannot explain why, but I simply didn&#039;t get impressed as much.<br />
<br />
(7/10 is regarding &quot;story&quot;)<br />
<br />
✦Art &amp; Sound<br />
<br />
A bit unique art, with the whole restaurant thematic, foods and the life of a kitchen staff. With a service&#039;y middle aged men with glasses as the main fetish. So In a sense I feel as it&#039;s service Anime for ladies that are into older men with glasses. Like the main girl of the series. But nevertheless the tone and the feeling I got out of this Anime visual aspect was very satisfying. <br />
<br />
Sound, same story. Very relaxing, fitting and enjoyable tones.<br />
<br />
✦Character<br />
<br />
Bunch of types of middle-aged men. Caring ones, kind ones, aggressive ones, salty ones and so on. With the restaurant serving thematic, they were fitting. And considering the whole mood and the feel of the series, I found the characters were fitting and actually in general quite relaxing and enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Of course we have our young girl that searches for her path and love. That all things considered is actually as well quite an enjoyable character.<br />
<br />
Aside that we got bunch of satisfying side-characters and some drama in between of them and their pasts.<br />
<br />
✦Enjoyment &amp; Overall<br />
<br />
I think I summed it up already. A very relaxing Italian restaurant themed Anime with a bunch of middle-aged men in glasses.<br />
<br />

    I believe in super short reviews:<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a cute story.  The plot is pretty straightforward and typical of the slice of life romance genre.  However, the characters are very well-developed, which is what makes this anime. The art is sort of like Nodame Cantabile (for better or worse).  <br />
<br />
It&#039;s good, and worth watching if you have some time, but not really a must-see.<br />
<br />
Warning: You may end up with a fetish for men in spectacles.

    I personally like it ...<br />
<br />
Its kind of relaxing watching per episode, maybe because its not fast paced kind of story but its not boring. Actually, I&#039;m eager to watch the next episode, because I like the older gentlemen character, its different and its kind of unique.<br />
<br />
The story not too complicated, straightforward, and every character has it own story which is developing the story as it is. When you watch it, it gives you a vibes of an adulthood.<br />
<br />
The heroine is a young female though, but I think you&#039;re not gonna find a story where the heroine was surrounded by an older gentlemen except in this

        one. Oyajicon... its not a familiar term, and actually I&#039;m still digesting that term, although I like older guy but ... I think you have to watch it If you want to know what I mean 😜 (I dont want to spoil it)<br />
<br />
I recommend it for those who want to watch an anime for an adult, slice of life, and romance genre.<br />

    Ristorante Paradiso is a really special show that fills a decidedly specific niche, and it does a satisfactory job of it without feeling trashy.<br />
<br />
It also fills a more general, less obvious kind of niche.  I stumbled upon this series while I was searching for some more mature &quot;josei&quot; titles to watch.  There&#039;s disappointingly little of this sort of thing out there in the sea of anime about high school students and/or violence &amp; destruction.<br />
<br />
The premise of a restaurant filled with bespectacled mature men is undeniably suggestive of the fantasy that drives the harem genre, but they never quite go there, and manage to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review235428">
        maintain a tasteful high ground throughout the show.  There&#039;s plenty of substance to make it interesting beyond just surrounding the MC with attractive old men.<br />
<br />
The setting is charming, and the story is believable.  Most of the characters are lovable, but I really hate the mom and her boyfriend, and never really got over it.  I think that affected my overall enjoyment of this show measurably.<br />
<br />
Something about the drawing style did not sit well with me for some reason, but maybe it&#039;s just my preferences.  The coloring and shading, along with the pervasiveness of food and wine, create a really cozy atmosphere though.<br />
<br />
I would definitely recommend this show if the theme interests you at all, or if you like josei titles.  The more I think about it, the more I realize this show is really something special, despite that I might have given it a mediocre rating.  By the way, if you&#039;re into this kind of thing, then you might also want to check out the (trashier) otome game called Pub Encounter, which is on Steam.

    I really liked this anime. Even though it was a bit angsty friom Nicoletta towards one of the waiters. <br />
<br />
I also enjoyed the other characters, they were interesting. I like an oddball ensemble cast of characters. I liked the fact all the waiters were nice to Nicoletta even though she came all the time at first to just mooch and figure out what to do while in Rome, while confronting her neglectful mother. <br />
<br />
The food looks really good. So does the animation. <br />
<br />
Hope this didn&#039;t have any major spoilers. I&#039;d suggest this animation to anyone really. It&#039;s very good!

    Read me right - main character represents the show. The character in Ristorante Paradiso is an underage girl - you can guess that as oppose to, say, Bartender, there will be more of a romantic touch. Naturally, because story flows around the girl, situations will be seen from her perspective - expect she&#039;ll look at men a lot, expect to be forced feel what she&#039;s feeling. Yes, it&#039;s definitely a girly anime, and because of that I dropped it, but there&#039;s something it has in common with Bartender - and it&#039;s calm slow storytelling, soft music, things that would relax yourself, which is something you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review95497">
        might&#039;ve been searching because there isn&#039;t much that kind of anime.<br />
It is also madly similar to Mushishi by the look, but I think visual resemblance isn&#039;t just enough to recommend it as alike.<br />
<br />
Again - girly, girly, girly, girly. If you&#039;re a girl, well, go watch both, you&#039;ll like &#039;em. If you&#039;re a dude.. I would not suggest.

    Honestly at first i didn&#039;t know if i would enjoy it, but at the end my day was pretty much perfect. It was my first time ever watching something as slow-paced as this anime, but i most definitely do not regret watching it. Honestly i&#039;d watch it again anytime that i just want a calm and peacefull afternoon.<br />

The most facinating thing about Ristorante Paradiso was the music and the art. It&#039;s all very soothing, calm and gentle. The music fit perfectly with every scene while the art was calmingly slightly old fashioned.<br />

        endge of my seat wanting to know really badly what happens in the next episode to the point where i wanted to skip the &quot;boring&quot; parts in a episode. I wanted to take my time. Enjoying each moment of an episode. It never got boring. It&#039;s a very lovely slow-paced anime that you can even only watch one episode a day just to calm down from a stressfull day.<br />
<br />
All in all i loved it and honestly if i were ever in Rome i would be very tempted to see if the place really excisted. Lovely anime for both male and female.
