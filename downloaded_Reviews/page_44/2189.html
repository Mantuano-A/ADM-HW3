    Before I begin I want to say this. Just go read the manga. The anime was good up until the ending of the last episode. They completely skipped many important stories from the festival up until where the manga is currently (Chapter 140). Even though I love this anime, I don&#039;t want others to watch this and see the terrible ending and thinking that&#039;s it. Just go and start the manga from the beginning. It is an amazing read. The rest of the season episodes 1-12 were all fine. But the ending of episode 13 just kills it. If you want to get a good

        experience then when you are watching episode 13 you can stop watching after a certain moment. You&#039;ll know it when it happens.

    This show is trash. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it. It doesn’t even try to hide the fact that it is indeed trash. It doesn’t take risks on the narrative, owns up to every typical harem trait ever, and just by watching it my functioning brain cells is halved each minute. Having paid the price of a million brain cells, I can, nevertheless, say without hesitation—I enjoyed this show, and I did so unreservedly.<br />
<br />
“Why?” You asked in confusion, “why would anyone enjoy trash?” Well, Bokuben has reached a level of honesty only the most courageous can attain. When other trashy shows hide

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320719">
        its true colours behind a curtain of drama, this show truly embraces being a dumpster. In short, I love honest shows.<br />
<br />
There’s no plot to be spoken of but MC-kun flirting with his harem, albeit unintentionally on a daily basis. The shy classmate, the outspoken childhood friend, the school goddess, the teasing senpai, the clumsy teacher… I wasn’t spouting vague character traits, those are real characters inside this show.<br />
<br />
They put some effort into the music though, not gonna lie. Both OPs in the first and second season is sung by the female leads of the show. The ED is nothing special though, not bad, but it probably would never get a place in my weeb playlist on Spotify. The character models are fine, but the animation is no good - it&#039;s literally manga on TV. Luckily, the manga panels flow quite nicely, which is a silver lining in the clouds.<br />
<br />
But all these serious analyses isn’t why you are here, it’s the second season already! You already know what you are getting into—complete nonsense. And yet, to all you people out there who are still watching, I applaud your wisdom, for you have discovered the true way to enjoy this show. Now, spread that knowledge to those around you, I envision one day where everyone can enjoy any show they watch, where suffering is no more in the land of anime.<br />
<br />
For those who want to try to get in the show, just leave your mind blank at all times. That’s how I think this series is best appreciated. And if you do so, I can promise it will be the most relaxed 20 minutes you are going to have all week. Just that you most likely won&#039;t be proud of yourself.<br />
<br />
As the Buddhist saying goes, &quot;the source of all pain is attachment.&quot; And this show has offered a first-hand experience on how true that is. Only by detaching ourselves from the chains of human decency and the pride as a tasteful weeb can we truly transcend and be freed of agony and pain - the pain from watching a dumpster in flames.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, what makes for a good anime is its ability to inspire. And the enlightenment this show bestowed on me has overcompensated for its flaws, proving itself worthy of a solid 7 and an earnest recommendation albeit with a pinch of salt.

    Have you ever watched an anime and thought to yourself that such things like &quot;developed characters that experience growth throughout the series and end in a different place from where they started&quot; or &quot;jokes that are written and develop onto each other too leave many laughs to come in future watches&quot; maybe perhaps &quot;a story that actually gives the audience this thing called PROGRESS&quot; are becoming such a bore for you as a viewer? Well do I have got good news for you then. Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! is the show for you because it has not only done away with all of those

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325280">
        pesky things but instead has substituted it with such wonderful things as... .... well nothing.  <br />
<br />
I&#039;m sure many people will try to convince you of this shows many &quot;positives&quot; such as cute girls, and..... cute girls, and more importantly.....more cute girls. Fear not though for i&#039;m hear to tell you this one gleaming positive in this pile of PTSD educing trash. There are in fact (wait for it) CUTE GIRLS. If all you want is cute girls then boy here&#039;s your show because this show has plenty of those. They might not have you know a personality but hey they&#039;re cute. Sadly though, this isn&#039;t like the first season where at the very least each new girl was worked into the story to make sure it didn&#039;t feel stale, no this time you have all of them from the start and boy just wait to see how long it takes you to want to kill all of them. <br />
<br />
Maybe this show could have been better. Maybe if the show had desired to grow up and spend the all new 13 episodes of it&#039;s second season picking it&#039;s OTP and developing the couple into a relationship we as the audience could have fallen in love with and enjoyed watching grow to a climax and conclusion. Is that what happened? No. Instead as an audience what do we get? We get 13 episodes of &quot;comedic misunderstandings&quot; that try to be funny and replace any attempt at actual comedy because hey watching a guy fumble around end up in &quot;scandalous&quot; situations with so many of his Hera... i mean friends is what passes as comedy now. We also get the shows most egregious offence IMO which is it simple can&#039;t pick a couple. At least SAO of all shows established a couple (not that it really mattered) and most other good harem shows establish a couple. Then we as the audience have a reason to watch as we get to see the couple either spend the show becoming a thing (which is overused and boring but at least something to grab on to) or be come a couple and go through actual couple issues (which is harder to find but when found is rewarding). Both of these would have been better then spending 13 episodes in a fight between the main character who has no personality and is severely autistic with girls to the point that the girls could strait up ask him out and he wouldn&#039;t know what they mean, and the girls who are as interchangeable as the show itself seems to think they are given how much it pretends like the MC will end up with one of them. <br />
<br />
This show isn&#039;t for me (if that wasn&#039;t obvious) but i genuinely mean this. If you found enjoyment in this show, i&#039;m happy for you. Really i am. It means you still enjoy this type of series. I&#039;m not the audience for this show and to anyone who (despite my comments in the beginning being on the sarcastic side) dose want more from their romance (because this show is romance don&#039;t try to tell me otherwise) then trust me when i say this show isn&#039;t for you either.

    Bokuben season 2 succeeds in building upon the foundations laid by season 1 very well. To save you time, if you liked Bokuben from the start, you will love season 2. If you didn&#039;t, you probably won&#039;t like this either.<br />
<br />
Bokuben is really simple in its premise and doesn&#039;t try to be something that it&#039;s not. It is a Harem Rom-Com. It&#039;s not trying to be really profound or thought provoking, it&#039;s meant to be an Otaku self escapism mechanism. Simple. However, that doesn&#039;t mean there&#039;s no story to be found here, and that&#039;s where in my opinion, season 2 makes significant improvements over the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325066">
        season. <br />
<br />
Season 1 of Bokuben was more of a flavour of the week type of excursion with Nairyuki being shipped with one of the girls each week with little in the way of actual overarching plot development or advancement. Season 2 improves on that with a very clear and obvious advancement of the plot each week. Each episode does build upon something and lead into the others. In fact, we get a character arc for each of the girls this season that really ads some much needed development for a few like Senpai and Takemoto. Other more established ships like Fumino and Sensei get their screen time as well, but it&#039;s with clear purpose. To give an example, there&#039;s a Fumino arc which really gives you important background information about her and her family and in my opinion, serves as the highlight of the season.<br />
<br />
Overall, Bokuben 2 is confident in what it is, doesn&#039;t try to be something it&#039;s not, builds upon the foundation we got in season 1 and is everything you&#039;ve come to love or not love from the series. The characters are cute, funny, silly, nervous and most importantly, they can&#039;t learn. Bokuben season 2 gets a 10/10 from me.

    We Never Learn: BokuBen is undoubtedly one of the trashiest school rom-com harem shows of recent years, but love it or hate it, it&#039;s unexpectedly become one of the best shows that we&#039;ve come to know of this year, having 2 full seasons within the span of 9 months, and knowing the author Taishi Tsutsui, his hard work have definitely paid off knowing that people are always in for the usual clickbait tropes and cliches that the harem genre is all but infamously known for, so much that even series like Negi Haruba&#039;s Gotoubun no Hanayome (which aired earlier in Winter and Season 2 next

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325055">
        Winter) are endeared in the highest regard (the anime adaptations are OK, but the respective mangas still are infinitely better).<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a fan of the typical high school rom-com genre, this should come as no surprise that the &quot;Waifu Wars&quot; that pretty much expanded in recent years is becoming a trend, and in the world of BokuBen, this hasn&#039;t changed with the titular MC Yuiga Nariyuki, and his ways of tutelage of the &quot;best girl&quot; race of Season 1, between the shy classmate Rizu Ogata, the school idol Fumino Furuhashi, and the childhood friend Uruka Takemoto. BUT NOW with Season 2, even the clumsy teacher Mafuyu Kirisu and the teasing Senpai Asumi Kominami wants in too, because &quot;Why not add unsuspecting characters that could potentially be &quot;Best Girls&quot; in the running aside from all those clichés and tropes from earlier&quot;!<br />
<br />
If you haven&#039;t watched Season 1, SHAME ON YOU, go watch that first and truly experience the wholesome &quot;trash&quot; that is the MC tutor being affectionately unconsciously &quot;flirting&quot; on every girl, so that they&#039;d have a running for his &quot;indirect kiss&quot; first and foremost. Now with Season 2, the stakes get higher as the trio of girls and Nariyuki are dead set on making their place in university, something that from the foreshadow of Season 1, Ogata, Fumino and Uruka still has a ways to go if they wanna achieve progress to university in their own right (oh, and claim the title of &quot;waifu material&quot; status too)! Along with Kirisu-sensei and the senior that is Kominami, they&#039;re sure NOT making Yuiga&#039;s life any better, for good or for worse, but rather getting him constantly into hot water &quot;thinking of ecchi&quot; moments.<br />
<br />
I mean, come on, we&#039;re already being &quot;degenerate&quot; weebs for watching this anime before in the first place, and holy cow, Season 2 ups the ante by a long shot, coming into question the gradual character development of why the trio of girls want to achieve what they wanna be at the beginning of Season 1 (and the manga), not to mention the calling of their lives once university sets in the harsh truth (and the most possible situation, being separate from Nariyuki). This &quot;red thread of fate&quot; of the group of 5 Waifus and 1 pure, naïve of a boy won&#039;t last forever...but Yuiga being Yuiga, his role is like the Buddhist saying: &quot;In the end, only three things matter: how much you loved, how gently you lived, and how gracefully you let go of things not meant for you.” <br />
<br />
It&#039;s truly a godsend message down from Heaven how Nariyuki shapes everyone&#039;s lives without knowing his impact of simple help and kindness that extends the range of his heartfelt desires to push people further and accomplish the best of them. How can you not afford to love the hell out of this MC?<br />
<br />
While nothing has changed in terms of visuals and animation, Silver and Arvo Animation did use Season 2 to improve and refine the mistakes of Season 1, which are always a welcome when it&#039;s literally the same artstyles and good fluid animation spliced in comedic gag moments which still manages to pace its timings well. The biggest change would always come from the musical side of things with the entirely new OST. While Season 1&#039;s OST is helmed by the female lead VAs, the same here can be said for the OP which is still quality, except Halca&#039;s ED, which is quite decent and OK (though honestly I&#039;d love to listen to another ED by them as well).<br />
<br />
My only minor gripe with Season 2 is that with Season 1&#039;s pacing of the first 40 chapters (which are a great introduction), the latter season just went haywire on its own with choosing which chapters and mini arcs to adapt this time. To someone who is tracking both the anime and manga at the same time, it nerves me to say that while the episodic theme is pretty much what the anime adaptation is gunning for, and the mini arcs are quite the welcome when it comes to people wanting to know what materials are adapted (coz it&#039;s a genuine thing now).<br />
<br />
To end this series on a high note, this quote sums it all well from Henry David Thoreau: &quot;If we will be quiet and ready enough, we shall find compensation in every disappointment.&quot; And that&#039;s what I can say about We Never Learn: BokuBen as a whole: It&#039;s a mindless, trashy, all-knowing harem, but with never-ending delicacies on the wayside that you cannot afford to ignore that&#039;s all good. Recommendation: watch both seasons and have yourself a very good time.

    It&#039;s been awhile since the last time I enjoy harem anime. Back in the day I was OBSESSED with it! Like the amount of time I would watch different type of harem is ridiculous. <br />
<br />
But as the time passed I got bored of it, I think manly because of the fact I don&#039;t like tsundere anymore. I mean I don&#039;t mind if they makes the tsundere character in the joking way, but for the super aggressive &quot;imma chop you head off, even though I love you&quot; tsundere just not sit well for me anymore. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s always that one character that I don&#039;t like in harem

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321519">
        and everytime their faces is on the screen I went &quot;Ugh&quot; but for some reason it never happened for BokuBen, Rizu, Fumino, Uruka, Senpai, Sensei, I love every single of them. <br />
<br />
Even though at first I thought Sensei is always gonna be a bit &quot;B*tchy&quot;. But as the time pass she ended up becoming my favourite character on the show. Even though she never show it, she actually cared about her student. She just trying to tell them that chasing after your dream that you not 100% guarantee for succeeding is not worth it, and it&#039;s going to risked your future. Just like what she went through with her dream sport. But oh well.<br />
<br />
The story itself is pretty good. The show is based around Romance so you should expected this to play a main role here. So, we got Rizu and Uruka who is in love with Nariyuki(He still didn&#039;t catch it. Standard) And Fumino knowing this, trying to help these two get close to him. Lil did she know that shes in the harem aswell. Because she trying to help these peoples getting closer, she ended up getting closer to Nariyuki aswell.<br />
<br />
As for Senpai she might have a lil feeling for Nariyuki. People say if you tease someone it means that you liked them. But for Senpai I&#039;m not 100% sure. She might just being thankful for what Nariyuki did for her.<br />
<br />
But her aim right now.. Well I should say all of the student aim right now is what they&#039;re studying for. Long story short: <br />
Rizu trying to understand more about people emotions. <br />
Uruka trying to go to the Uni she aiming for because of her swimming capability. <br />
Senpai trying to take over her father on becoming a doctor.<br />
Fumino is looking for her &quot;mother&#039;s star&quot; and wanting her life to have a connection to the stars. And for that she need to pass Science exam and learn astronomy. <br />
<br />
So to put romantic feeling in between of these is going to be difficult. <br />
So far the things above didn&#039;t put enough impact on the show for people to care. But these things is going to play a big role in the future. On what will they do about their feeling combining with the thing they been study for.<br />
I can&#039;t wait for that.<br />
<br />
So far I enjoyed this show, the story is good, the characters is fantastic, the screen-time for each character is also good. It&#039;s a well balanced harem anime, I enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
If you want lovable characters and some good romcom harem, I recommended this show.<br />
<br />
Sidenote: This show so far is nothing serious, it&#039;s just a pure RomCom Harem. So if you looking for light anime to ease and calm your heart this show is good.

    What about another HAREM to end the year? <br />
<br />
·Story: 5/10<br />
<br />
Bokutachi has all the facts that exist in the harem/teenager genre. It has cute girls with different personalities, a mc that is gentle with them and the typical settings of the school and slice of life genre. <br />
<br />
Not being original, but not being bad is how I would define the plot of this anime. You would not find anything apart from the mythical school trips, school festivals and students that study together to pass the exams.<br />
<br />
·Art: 6/10<br />
<br />
Being an harem just established my expectations for its art pretty low, and yeah, it was as I expected to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325087">
        be.<br />
<br />
The general art scenes are pretty fair and I think that both companies Arvo and Silver did a pretty good job, as they are pretty new (From what I&#039;ve seen on MAL).<br />
<br />
Obviously, the ecchi scenes get better in terms of the art but not too much. This made me reconsider the mark from a 7 to a 6.<br />
<br />
·Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
Effects were good but nothing more. During the whole anime I could only hear some music during romance/ecchi/stressful situations and they weren&#039;t too spectacular.<br />
<br />
OP is what made me give it a 7 as I liked it pretty much. If you like happy and energetic OPs, this one is for you.<br />
<br />
·Character: 6/10<br />
<br />
As I said, you have some cute girls with different personalities, but not too distant from each other. Uruka, Fumino and Rizu are the ones that have more emphasis during the second season and all of them have that type of insecurity at the time of talking with Nariyuki, which shares this point with them.<br />
<br />
In the case of Mafuyu and Asumi, the relationship between them and Nariyuki doesn&#039;t advance too much, so don&#039;t expect nothing from this two cute girls.<br />
<br />
·Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
<br />
I like happy and relaxing shows so this one came perfectly to me during winter. If you are stressed and you don&#039;t want to see any action or thriller anime this serie is perfect for that situation.<br />
<br />
·Overall: 6/10<br />
<br />
At the end, bokutachi has been one of my preferences to see this winter. Hope you enjoy it as well! <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading!<br />
<br />
SPOILER: The reason I don&#039;t give it a higher mark is because as all harem animes, it doesn&#039;t give a clear final and you won&#039;t know who is the girl that he ends with. It seems Uruka won but it isn&#039;t completly clear so..... LETS GO READ THE MANGA!

    Wow, least than 3 months of the release of the first season, here we go again.<br />
And I’m going to be honest, I really liked the first season, I thought that the development of the story and the genre was great, the characters were funny and entertaining, the ridiculous scenes did not felt forced or annoying they felt fresh and comic, but the best part is my opinion were the production and the animation. And those are elements that I never touched when I watched and reviewed an anime. But in this case they connect perfectly with the funny and romantic moments. Also, even I was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325257">
        not a fan of the opening, the background music in every single episode was perfect, because fit in the comic animation and the ridiculous situations so well. The voices were great too, the seiyus add more personality to every character. So yeah I really liked the first season, so going into this new season I was expecting the next phase of the anime, maybe maturity in the characters, a little change in the premise, or at least more funny and memorable moments. And what does this new season leave us?<br />
In general, I really enjoy this season too, for almost all the reasons I liked the first season, especially the first part of the anime (episode 1 to 5), in a moment I thought that I was watching some extra material of the first season, but then present us the maturity of some characters taking their future seriously and the last leg is when they make what they want it to do. It’s a good body of work and they presented different emotions through the anime, many of them meet their goal, but other ones, not really; I’m going to explain why thought his review, but let’s start with:<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The introduction in the first episode reflects that the order of the things remains completely the same: A poor guy of high school who needs to teach three girls of his same high school the subjects they need to study to go to the college and achieve their goal. And they show us a little summary of how the girls improved in the subjects that they found difficult; and after that the story continues without further interruption. <br />
<br />
Development of the story:<br />
I really liked the little and quick summary of the main theme of the anime, because they weren’t redundant and boring explaining every single detail of the first season. And after that, they show through this first leg of the anime the same qualities of the first season: The ridiculous but funny situations, the charismatic and entertaining characters, the exaggerated but hilarious reactions and animations of every comic or romantic moments and the humorous background music of the situations, and that’s why I thought for a moment that his season would be the rest of the first season; like I if I was watching the episode 14 to 26, but I wasn’t upset or disappointed about it.  All the elements that I already mentioned were enough to had a funny or good moment in the anime. Some scenes were so ridiculous and funny that I couldn&#039;t stop seeing them and laughing about it, at least they were completing their goal of entertaining. But in the middle (episode 6) the things start to get serious because we found that the characters start to took serious their future. This part of the anime is really interesting because we found the difficult decisions that the characters need to do to realize their dreams and what they want to do with their life (Specially in Nariyuki). I found the story of Fumino and her relationship with her father the best moment in the anime, the drama is good well done, the performances feel real and hard and the romantic and comic touches complement very well. But unfortunately, we found some boring and uninteresting moments, and this is because the redundancy of some of the goals or romantic moments of the girls (Ogata and Uruka) and the uninteresting parts of the development of their future, particularly in Uruka. And the last leg of this, is kind of cliché and predictable, but at least is funny how all the things are randomly ejected. But I was really surprised at the finale of the anime, it was little hurried and confusing like why they made it look like it was the final goodbye I don’t know. Maybe they are planning something more about the anime, but who knows. I’m not going to deny that watched the grown versions of the characters were great. In general, although some forgettable things and boring moments, the development is enjoyable and funny enough to have a good time laughing at some of the ridiculous things presented or the comic reactions and performances of every character.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
They were okay, I don’t have many complaints about them, maybe a few. Almost the same qualities and personality that they presented in the first season it’s showed in this season too. Nariyuki Yuiga, the main role, is one of the best in my opinion. As always, is the guy who has the typical misunderstandings with the girls, but almost all of them are so dumb that are entertaining, for example in the first episode. But I really liked how the story focuses on him and his future, how he has a difficult time finding what he wants to do. Also it remains his worrying of the future of the girls, but also how he helps to solve their life problems. His maturity is the best part of him in this season, his role is nice and complete, but is not the best of all. In my opinion Fumino Furuhashi is the best character. Not only she remains her comic, funny, lovely and cute personality, but we see more in depth in her childhood, how hard is the relationship with her father, and how her decision of study Astronomy complicate the things more. Her comic reactions in my opinion are the best, because how exaggeratedly laughable are, is the reason why the episode 5 is one of the best. Her relationship with Yuiga is cute and funny, their moments together are the best romantic moments of all the season. So yeah, Fumino is not only the best of the three girls, in my opinion is the best of the entire season. <br />
Ogata Rizu has her funny moments too, and sincerely, is the most mature character of all, how she transforms of a serious, angry and graciously expressionless to a funnier, cute, lovely, and especially expressive girl. In the episodes 1, 4 and 5 it looks clearer this. But not all her moments are like this, because what slow Rizu for been one of the best is that her dramatic moments are fulfilled of the redundancy of what she wants to study, also it feels a little boring and predictable, the best example of this in the episode 7. But at least I can say she is not that boring as Uruka Takemoto, which is in my opinion, the least interesting character. She remains her energetic, cute and shy personality, and through the anime has her funny moments (especially in the episode 5), but her romantic moments with Yuiga are forgettable, predictable and a little lackluster, the moments where they talked about her future feel boring and easy to ignore and sometimes her attitude feels overreacted. So yeah, I wasn’t a fan of her in this season.<br />
I really enjoyed the participation of Sawako Sekijo, the moments where she is in the spotlight feels fresh and interesting, I liked how her relationship with Ogata has grown a little bit and the moments where she wants to connect Rizu and Yuiga are funny and well done, also her story is nice too; I really liked his secondary role. With the sensei Mafuyu Kirisu, when she helps and advice Yuiga of his future and she mentions his qualities, I loved that, because she plays perfectly the role of what she is: a teacher. But the rest of her moments they felt a little repetitive and uninteresting, especially the comic moments; I enjoyed more his role in the first season than this. I don’t have complaints about Asumi, she acts normally like in the first season, and it’s funny and hilarious when she has the spotlight in the series. And I don’t have much to say about the rest, they just feel normal: The Furuhashi friends that wants to Fumino and Yuiga had romance moments, the Uruka friends that push Uruka to have moments with Nariyuki and the Nariyuki’s sister, Mizuki: She has her funny moments, I don’t have any complaint about her.<br />
<br />
Development of the genre:<br />
As the first season, the comedy moments complement very well with the situations that are presented, and yeah, maybe some of these moments are cliché but the way that the animation and production works in them, just fits perfectly. Many of the romantic moments feels cute and entertaining, as I said before the moments where Fumino and Nariyuki are together are the best, but in general at least they tried to maintain the same vibes of the first season. The drama moments are great too, how they associate with the future or goals of the characters, even if sometimes feels a little boring but I’ll take it. The ecchi moments, like the first season, feel fresh, comical and laughable. The development here convinces in general.<br />
<br />
Music:<br />
I wasn’t a fan of the opening of the first season, but now with this new opening, this is probably one of the best openings I heard this year: The funny, happy and sunny instrumentation is perfect, the chorus is addictively good, every vocalist of the group Study is great and the moments where they sing together are amazing under this sweet melody. I loved this. I like the ending too, it has a more comical vibe, but the instrumentation and that funny chorus complement well. But been honest I prefer the ending of the first season. But the background music, as the first season, is amazing, complements very well with every situation presented, there are sweet and sunny melodies in the romantic moments and there are funny and laughable melodies in the comedy moments. I really liked the music in this season, maybe one of the strongest points in the series.<br />
<br />
And I don’t want to go without give it a shout to the amazing animation, production and the seiyuus of this season, especially when they use little heads most of the time in the comedy moments and when the expressions are exuberantly hilarious as the anime goes. And the voices fit perfect with the attitude of every character, when they shout (especially Nariyuki) or talk in a funny tone are just wonderful.  <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Despite the moments where the situations feel repetitive and some attitudes of the characters feel a little boring, in general, Bokutachi II is a funny, fresh and entertaining follow-up of the first season and where the animation, production, music and the seiyuus stole the show. And we can’t forget about the good performances of the characters, at least every one had one funny and memorable moment that I’m going to remember maybe for the rest of my life. I’m sure that this wasn’t the final of the anime, they just can’t finish this good piece of work in this way; and apparently an OVA is on the way, so we just need to wait what this anime offer us in the future.<br />
I give this an 8 out of 10. I have high hopes for this anime, for me this season was another win and I just hope the better for this story and their characters in a closer upcoming.<br />

    Ok so BokuBen season 2 has ended and it did have a clean ending.<br />
<br />
So: <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Pros: It still has the same plot about the guy who was forced into tutoring 4 girls , 3 of them were strong in a few subjects , but weak in other and in return he gets good recommendation to a top university, and there was that good ending where it strongly suggest that it was Uruka who&#039;ll end up with Nariyuki.<br />
<br />
Cons: Though it still uses the same plot from the 1st season, there were just some harem based anime such as this that should&#039;ve have not given a 2nd season,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325093">
        cu&#039;z thought it has that comedy genre, the genre itself was annoyingly stupid.<br />
<br />
Verdict: 5 over 10.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Pros: The same character illustration, fanservices and eyecandies, as usual.<br />
<br />
Cons: Don&#039;t expect any good panty flashes and nipples services, as usual. <br />
<br />
Verdict: 5 over 10.  <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Pros: The same seiyuu who did the voices of them characters.<br />
<br />
Cons: The same seiyuus that did them voices of them characters.<br />
<br />
Verdict: 5 over 10.<br />
<br />
Character: <br />
<br />
Pros: The same characters who did delivery the laughs from the 1st season.<br />
<br />
Cons: The same character that were annoying rather than being funny since their comedic roles have been way to underrated.<br />
<br />
Verdict: 5 over 10.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Pros: The only part I enjoy here was the clean ending.<br />
<br />
Cons: The rest were just annoying with their underrated antics.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Verdict: 3 over 10.<br />
<br />
Ok,so it has an clean ending and that&#039;s the silver lining, however IMAO this simply doesn&#039;t deserve a 2nd sequel to begin with with all that stupidity around.    <br />
<br />

    I don&#039;t believe that this anime needs to be special or different to be good.I watch anime to pass my time and for enjoyment.Which is basically what this anime is, a fun watchable harem anime.<br />
<br />
The anime isn&#039;t special in anyway and doesn&#039;t need to be. It&#039;s a seasonal harem anime which is quite generic and predictable. But i still found myself excited to watch the next episode every week.It may be because of the likeable characters and the balanced screentime and decent art and sound but i know not everyone will have the same taste as me<br />
<br />
I recommend this anime to people that just want

        to watch an harem anime which doesn&#039;t need to be very good or very bad.<br />

    Nothing happens, it&#039;s like a season of specials.<br />
<br />
BokuBen was all about the cheesy semi-harem but also a bigger goal, tutoring the girls in the respective subjects to follow their dream careers. It was their cute, comical struggles and overcoming those hardships that made me love the show. There was an interesting story, there was character development, some suspense, dramma, it was all in all a good show. I mean it wasn&#039;t perfect but it was enough for me to watch the second season, and boy did it have to be good.<br />
<br />
If you haven&#039;t guessed by now I think season two sucked ass. Not only does

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325357">
        nothing happen, all you get is cheap jokes and just heaps of shit. Of course a little is actually good, hell even a lot, as long as there is the all important plot progression, which there isn&#039;t, well there is *very* little of it.<br />
<br />
All in all, I felt like I was being forced to watch this show. I know it sounds crazy but it was season one that kept me going, hoping that maybe something, anything interesting would happen, and... yeah not much really hell if you were thinking on watching but now you aren&#039;t sure, just watch the last 3 or 4 episodes.

    The anime was fine, and it is exciting to watch it, because it got lots of fan services. However, the anime ended at a very incomplete cliffhanging way. If you guys wanted to watch the continuation of which girl yuiga will choose. I would suggest go and read the manga, the author made it in such a way that yuiga will pick all the girls one by one. Something like route ending. Well I maybe more fond of watching an anime with a one whole plot, but this way is not so bad after all. Goodluck guys have fun reading the manga.

    At the time writing about the first season of this series, I was already referring to it as a simple series that without doing anything particularly innovative or striking in what at first glance seemed to be little more than a list of clichés to be fulfilled, manages to have its own charm and was one of the series that I enjoyed watching week by week. With the second season I have to say that it is a fairly similar case, it is still a romantic comedy with harem elements in appearance of the bunch, but with enough charisma to remind me why I like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332387">
        this kind of series even with its small flaws, that its honesty in what it is feels comfortingly familiar among so many other works that try to play around with the metanarrative or the clever twists but fail in the attempt.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai, also called We Never Learn or simply shortened as Bokuben, this review is dedicated to the second animated adaptation of the eponymous romantic comedy manga written and illustrated by Taishi Tsutsui. <br />
<br />
<br />
This second season continues to introduce us to Nariyuki&#039;s efforts to support the girls he studies with even if he ends up in occasional misunderstandings with them, as he begins to decide what he wants for his future.<br />
<br />
<br />
Following the simple but always effective formula of episodes dedicated by segments to the different girls and their interactions with Nariyuki with the occasional detail of character development, this is a series that does not go down the most dramatic path of romantic comedies, focusing usually more in the more comical and occasionally fanservice section of this kind of series, giving a greater focus of attention to the misunderstandings that make us think that the city and school where the whole series takes place has a very small population. In general I have to say that although it looks like your typical romcom from the heap, it has a solid enough execution to be an entertaining show. Unfortunately I must admit that despite everything I have a small problem, the series in order to reach certain most emblematic arcs of the manga skips quite fillers which is not necessarily a bad thing, but by the nature of this work small details of the development of its characters were lost at the same time. Nothing too serious, but I recommend that those who have only seen the anime give a reading to the manga, although the addition of an original ending to the series gives something of added value to the viewing.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the technical work, I must say that it is still functional although nothing particularly wonderful. With everything and its occasional fanservice we are facing a series that is pleasant to see with its colorful settings and characters, although it shows when they try to save on small details such as when they ignore many of the hairstyle changes that Fumino has throughout the manga but that does not spoil the show. At times punctual yet corny the direction manages to bring more produced scenes to life, while offering compelling settings and easy-to-recognize characters including the quirky CGI dance scene that resulted in something worthy of any idol anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
As with its first season the soundtrack is similar to what animation is, nothing to complain about but nothing particularly surprising. The work on the voices of the characters is satisfactory and the soundtrack is energetic, retaining several of the already characteristic instrumental themes that the first season gave us. For its part, the opening of this season is the cheerful &quot;Can now, Can now&quot; performed by the series seiyuus under the group name of Study, meanwhile the ending is &quot;Houkago no Liberty&quot; performed by the singer Halca.<br />
<br />
<br />
The second season of Bokuben is something that I enjoy a lot week by week, but I really have nothing more to say that I have not written in this review. This is an honest series in its simplicity as a romantic comedy that connected with me by how familiar it is with all the early series I watched more than a decade ago. If you are looking for an intelligent series or one with a deep message, this anime is not for you, but if you just want something to spend some time with, give it a try.

    CGI the only reason this isn&#039;t a 10 is because the use of CGI was really distracting and felt out of place with the frame rate of the models. It looked stiff and almost laggy especially next to the beautifully drawn 2d backgrounds and trying to mesh the two types of animation together just does not work.<br />
<br />
That said what a ride this series was, it grabbed my attention and never let it go until the ride was over. I loved the characters and their voice actors and how they somehow made fan service lewd and wholesome at the same time was just a perfect blend.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400204">
        For the first time ever this is the one harem series where every girl is best girl. It doesn&#039;t matter who is on screen because each character has a strong presence no matter what is happening and you can tell the voice actors and writers poured their heart into this series.<br />
<br />
The music while very subtle crafted some of the most beautiful moments and emotions and for that alone I have to praise it by itself.<br />
<br />
I will 100% be picking up the manga~

    This show is fuckin&#039; boring, but i still had a tiny bit of enjoyment in it<br />
<br />
im pretty sure i saw this show(especially the festival) in other original romcom harems like the quintissential quintuplets. it dosent want to be different and decides to continue to check off their list of annoying anime cliches without substance, oh yeah, and itll never end until the author dies, there will be no winning girl(again, unlike quintuplets) and itll never have an interesting conclusion. the verbal jokes were funny but the physical jokes were dumbed down to &quot;girl has something lewd done to her with nobody ACTUALLY at fault so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326410">
        its a misunderstanding&quot;<br />
<br />
its like it was designed as a guide for all the anime cliches you should know in romcoms so you can understand other, better anime that has a proper concept and story

    Another season has come and gone and so along with it the continuation of a trashy harem series. At this rate, if you&#039;ve watched the first season or other harem in general, you knew what you were getting with this. Time for my review of the second season of We Never Learn.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story- <br />
<br />
Our story of course, is the continuation of a harem series that debuted in the Spring season of this year. It&#039;s your typical harem, characters get set up in awkward predicaments, misunderstandings happen, humor ensues. While it serves its purpose, its by far nothing new or exhilarating. Face it, we watch this genre

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325278">
        for one thing: to turn our brains off and cheer for our favorite ship.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art-<br />
<br />
As a whole the art won&#039;t blow you away. The girls look cute and adorable, Nariyuki still looks your run of the mill MC, not much to cover here. Again, if you watched the first season, nothing has changed worth noting.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters- <br />
<br />
With the genre we&#039;re dealing with, this is the pivotal aspect when deciding how much you&#039;re actually going to endorse into this series. Thankfully, with We Never Learn I feel like all the girls at least bring something positive to the table, especially Fumino. Her arc involving her dad was easily the most entertaining aspect of this second season. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, eh. Season wasn&#039;t all that good, but it wasn&#039;t frustratingly irritating for a second season like Nisekoi was. This genre will always fall more into the guilty pleasure for people despite most of them having glaring issues. I guess we never learn.<br />
<br />
<br />
Recommendations: Quintessential Quintuplets and Ore suki<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(Future note for my later reviews: I&#039;m probably just going to end up skipping the sound grading because they usually tend to say the same thing on all of them, so i&#039;ll only comment on it if it made an impact on me)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again for reading my reviews, I know this one isn&#039;t the greatest but I still appreciate any feedback you guys give me and as always I hope my opinions help.

    Oh God, where to start.<br />
<br />
Well, as a reader of the manga I can say that up till after the credits of the last episode of the season, I can say that other than a couple important missing chapters that developed a few of the characters a bit more that I expected would be addressed in season 3, so I&#039;d say it was an alright adaptation.<br />
<br />
But oh God, here comes the dreaded &quot;We&#039;re not making another season, so let&#039;s just make the ending ourselves&quot; bull-crap, but the problem is that the manga isn&#039;t finished yet and that like half the series will most certainly not be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325090">
        adapted for another season, and very important characters will not have their arcs for anime only viewers.<br />
<br />
I would have given this a 6 or 7 in character, story and enjoyment if they left on a cliffhanger and knowing a third season would be coming, but after that ending it destroyed any chances for season 3 and sank this anime&#039;s worth in my eyes.<br />
<br />
Read the manga if you care for an actual satisfying story, but skim through the chapters that seem familiar, as I forgot which chapters didn&#039;t get an adaptation.

    &quot;We never learn&quot; is definitely one of the best comedy-romance anime. You won&#039;t actually find an episode where you won&#039;t laugh, you will laugh in every episode especially here in the 2nd season. However, it is not just pure comedy, it&#039;s comedy filled with beautiful romance moments. Despite being a harem anime type, it is not boring like some harem anime.. but rather amazes you with fun and interesting girls characters. <br />
<br />
<br />
Season 2 is without a doubt more interesting and fun than season 1. In each episode you will be surprised at how much you enjoyed watching, with lots of funny situations along with getting

    It&#039;s spinning it&#039;s wheels...Arc Fatigue as you will...for half the runtime anyways<br />
<br />
LA liked the first season of Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai where it shaked up some sense of the harem in which it removed the first girls wins scenario but it could go somewhere great, but where Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! has something going, Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! just kept going and going, thankfully this formula stopped once Uruka&#039;s episode starts.<br />
<br />
LA only found out that Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! was spinning it&#039;s wheels since the third episode, like yes the harem or a harem member getting some time with Nariyuki and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325070">
        everything is nice especially in giving us equal screentime to the harem of 5 but besides the good equal screentime to the harem to Nariyuki, nothing much happens besides that which is a shame as it could shake things up in giving us something, ANYTHING to give us what the first season did. Don&#039;t get LA wrong when LA watched the first season, LA went with it and it was somewhat refreshing but now with Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai building it&#039;s foundation, Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! is now continuously building to the point it&#039;s leaning to the point of collapse now, it&#039;s arc fatigue whilst trying to give your favourite girl that screentime, but if everyone gets it, no one will most probably steps up and that is Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! biggest problem. The other problem LA will say is that Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! tends to bring in the whole &quot;misunderstanding&quot; situation that Nariyuki and one of his harem members goes through as well thus spinning it&#039;s wheels as well. <br />
<br />
BUUUT...<br />
<br />
On the flip-side, LA is still thankful that Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! does give each girl equal screentime and sure giving some VERY coincidental situations where all 5 members being in the same place at the same time as Nariyuki is but LA gets what Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! is doing nonetheless at the end of it. Heck to be honest, the best character to actually step up for the first half at least was Sawako Sekijou voiced by Saori Oonishi, the &quot;rival&quot; of Rizu and we actually see their friendship grow and thanks to Nariyuki as well that it grows as well so there is that as some sense of growth and for LA&#039;s most relatable character, it&#039;s also good to see that it&#039;s Sawako to get the development in saying to open up, instead of the stoic-tsundere anti social Rizu, so a twist on that trope.<br />
<br />
To this end, as this season DID spin it&#039;s wheels for half the season, it&#039;s the second half where any good character development comes in and of course from most of the harem especially Furuhashi and Uruka&#039;s episodes and arcs. Uruka&#039;s gave us a fresh take on the childhood friend trope mixed in with her maybe leaving for a better school and this obviously affecting Uruka&#039;s feelings for Nariyuki. Furuhashi&#039;s arc is a solid effort in developing her and as to why she wants to be an astronomer and that has to with her maths obsessed father that was shown in the first half at one point. Yes the entire neglected father tropes does come into play with Furuhashi but her development is more like a reformation of her family through broken ties and beliefs, something Mafuyu told Furuhashi to do, but quite obviously Nariyuki helps Furuhashi both in her academic endevours but this time, helping with her family issues. Quite honestly she was immensely developed with her arc making finding best girl that much harder, well she has one of the better character developments this season at the very least. The final few episodes were an ensemble piece with Nariyuki again this time with the school festival and oddly enough the anime changes focus to not the harem members BUT to Nariyuki himself, something LA didn&#039;t think about (kinda funny seeing the second season poster not having him reflects how LA thought of Nariyuki even with his good points about him as a protagonist) and as much as Nariyuki helps his harem out academically, he himself doesn&#039;t know where he&#039;s headed and plot wise it goes in a nice direction, coinciding with Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! typical harem hijinks in a school festival setting with it&#039;s ensemble cast flavour.<br />
<br />
The animation done once again by Silver and Arvo Animation is pretty much the same as it&#039;s first season right down to do comical reactions to the pretty solid character designs, can&#039;t really say much about the animation besides that it&#039;s the same as the first season right down to the little detail and consistency.<br />
<br />
The voice cast is back and LA will give some MVP&#039;s out due to the more serious drama side it takes, that of Haruka Shiriashi as Fumino Furuhashi and Lynn as Mafuyu Kirisu gets LA&#039;s MVP with Sayumi Suzushiro getting a close third for the voice cast.<br />
<br />
Due to how equal the harem gets in terms of screentime, LA&#039;s stance on LA&#039;s favourite character hasn&#039;t really changed that much, LA is still more or less rooting for Mafuyu and her screentime was great, Fumino and Asumi closely following and Rizu being even more relatable to LA. <br />
<br />
Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! sure spun it&#039;s wheels for the first half with it&#039;s only problem being that this season suffered heavily from arc fatigue and contrived coincidences but on the offset developed minor characters especially Sawako, but once the latter half starts, Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! really brings what LA wanted it to be like, with major character development from the harem, taking things in new directions for a harem anime, not too serious but great character development for the harem AND the main protagonist. Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! has a slow twiddling it&#039;s fingers for the first half, but it gets better in the latter half thankfully from it&#039;s character development episodes/arcs.<br />
<br />
Ultimately...for LA at least. <br />
<br />
Mafuyu is best girl<br />
Fumino has best character development<br />
Rizu best relatable<br />
Uruka best childhood friend turn<br />
Asumi is best chaotic factor<br />
<br />
What are the chances that any romantic resolution with Nariyuki will NEVER come with this harem anime though?...just LA?...

    I really wanted to enjoy this show. I found the premise of it really fun for a harem where it was about studying and getting better at a specific subject as that&#039; relatable for students but I guess the story forgot that for the sake of mindless generic rom-com situations. If the story had actual progression and character development I would&#039;ve liked it. <br />
<br />
At the beginning of season one, I found the premise really good. It had a nice initial hook but for some reason, the story stopped being interesting and it devolved into something very generic. <br />
I can&#039;t really pinpoint why I started disliking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342022">
        this series but I&#039;m just more disappointed at it at this point. I think the openings of both seasons is a valid enough explanation for me. I loved season one&#039;s opening because it had a kind of narrative. The visuals are really nice and the part where they&#039;re just studying is really nice for some reason. Everyday things such as studying is something that&#039;s always at the background for most animes set in high school so I thought maybe this anime would bring it to the forefront and make it interesting. In season two the amazing visuals are gone for the opening credits. Sure there are some good implementations of the credits but nothing more. It became generic. <br />
<br />
Basically I&#039;m disappointed that this series became generic and wish that it took the characters seriously and gave them depth I guess
