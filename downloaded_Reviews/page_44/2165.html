    NERDS!<br />
<br />
So, yeah. This is just plain funny comedy show. It features a lot of science and other stupid stuff.<br />
<br />
The Story: Himuro Ayame and Yukimura Shinya have feelings toward each other but as they are huge science nerds, they don&#039;t believe is the feelings of love since feelings are not real but science is, so they start to analyze the signs of love and other stupid stuff like that. We follow them while they conduct research on love and how to recognize the signs of love. There are a lot of actual science which is nice. Towards the end they need to present their findings on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331569">
        love in front of &quot;hardcore&quot; scientists.<br />
<br />
Characters: We have our main couple, Himuro and Yukimura. They are highly hilarious together. The research they do goes from how and where to go to a date, does the oxytocin level rise if they like each other etc. Himuro sometimes feels like a tsundere but she is very open about their relationship. Yukimura is very serious and does everything for science. Of course we are talking about a person who has never touched a woman so some of the test are hard. Of course the man has said some very good one liners. Let&#039;s move to the supporting cast: We haver our legal loli Ibarada Ena who probably plays more games than she should, Kanade Kotonoha is also a scientist who for some reason knows martial arts, my favourite madlad Inukai Kosuke, the man just spends all his time playing dating sims. He also had to make a presentation so he did it on dating sims, and he gained praise for it. Such a madman. and of course Professor Ikeda. He is also smart as heck and he is a fusion between Senku and Machio. He is very smart but when he is angry, he is very fucking scary and buff like a JoJo character.<br />
<br />
The ost is fairly good sounding and the opening is very great. The song is very cool and so is the visuals.<br />
<br />
If you like science, romcoms and other bullshit like that, then this show is for you. The comedy in my opinion is very funny but comedy is relative so not all people will like this but I recommend you trying this out.

    DISCLAIMER: My review will NOT contain major spoilers. <br />
<br />
TL;DR This is basically Kaguya-sama with faster character development, a crap ton of science for you to laugh about (or be confused about), and a bit more drama to top it off. If you like science, you&#039;d probably enjoy this; if you know your science, then you&#039;ll love this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I like you.&quot;<br />
This series doesn&#039;t overstate its welcome. It kicks off its first episode with this one line. This one phrase sets the whole plot in motion, and it&#039;s realised in the scientific-comedy and romance part of the series.<br />
<br />
I watched all 12 episodes of this series and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326417">
        I can definitely say this is a very enjoyable and humorous romcom. What&#039;s interesting here is that the punchlines are even funnier if you knew your science well; the humour is obviously directed towards a small demographic, and the characters themselves are a lot more relatable if you&#039;d been in their shoes. If you have zero interest in Science Maths Psychology etc, this series would be very confusing 50-75% of the time or boring. But this doesn&#039;t mean you won&#039;t get a few chuckles in each episode. It&#039;s just that it is outright hilarious to see how the series uses scientific concepts in the plot and character interactions.<br />
<br />
*Story: 7*<br />
The story seems pretty simple - the pair is trying to figure out a scientific theory to prove if they like one another or not. Right off the bat the series establishes its goal and just gets the plot moving from there. The plot is that much more intriguing if you are actually a Science student, concepts you&#039;d learn previously are heavily utilised in the story. I&#039;m not saying ordinary people wouldn&#039;t enjoy this, but seeing these concepts used in a half-jokingly manner makes the story feel very enjoyable and rewarding, only if you knew these concepts already. I&#039;d compare this to how Science was used in Dr. Stone, that show didn&#039;t waste time of explaining too much, because everyone knows a bit of science these days. It&#039;s just that this show depends on your scientific knowledge a bit more.<br />
<br />
Aside from the geeky stuff used, however, the plot line itself is too generic and predictable, which is why I didn&#039;t rate its story higher. Mixed with the maths, the science, etc, the plot becomes more of &quot;Hm how would they answer this?&quot; instead of &quot;Hm what&#039;s going to happen next?&quot;, which I think is actually a good thing.<br />
<br />
*Art:7*<br />
Not much to say about art style. I like it when they change the overall art style to fit certain characters. However, the animation is pretty generic for the rest of the runtime, but I didn&#039;t have a single problem with it.<br />
<br />
*Sound: 7*<br />
Again, nothing much to comment on. The OP and ED are very catchy, and the OSTs are also not bad. The songs and ambient noises fit well with the story. But then again, it&#039;s not like you are watching this for amazing sound effects or art.<br />
<br />
*Characters: 9*<br />
This is in my opinion why this series isn&#039;t gonna be as enjoyable for everyone. The whole series is basically based off of scientist humour, it executes it quite well but not everyone is going to understand it. The characters have extremely specific intentions and interests. Their actions are so &quot;scientific&quot; there is barely any way to relate to them if you hadn&#039;t learnt those concepts previously. The story tries to explain the concepts midway with the cute bear cutscenes, but I think it&#039;s a bit too vague for anyone to get a grasp of it quickly. Even the bear tells the audience that &quot;this is too complicated&quot; so &quot;learn it by yourself&quot;. When the characters made breakthroughs, I myself felt like I was doing this investigation with them. I had the same eureka moments as them when they&#039;d thought of something new. <br />
<br />
Personality-wise, most of the characters take their generic anime personalities to the extreme in this story, especially the two main leads. The hyperbolic personalities of the characters makes the humour that much more worthwhile. But then again, the characters suffer from the same problem as the plot - you won&#039;t like them if you don&#039;t understand them. While this is true for most animes, this is that much more significant in this story because the plot development relies on these pre-existing knowledge that they expect the viewer to have. Funnily enough I really liked Kanade&#039;s character in the story, her reactions are just perfect and her struggles are much more grounded when compared to the others. I enjoyed every single second of the characters interactions, but it might not be true if you didn&#039;t even know what they were babbling about.<br />
<br />
*Enjoyment: 9*<br />
I like science, I like maths, I like psychology, and most importantly I like my romcom. This series is practically made for me, and I&#039;m sure they&#039;d be others like me out there who adore these interests the same way I do. I have nothing more to say really, the concepts of a Sciency romcom is enough for me to go nuts over. The amount of enjoyment you are gonna get is similar to how anime fans enjoy Your Name more than ordinary viewers - it rewards audiences for knowing their stuff.<br />
<br />
*Overall: 8*<br />
As much as I subconsciously know that this series isn&#039;t as great as I say it is, in the end it was still very enjoyable and I only had a few nitpicks about it. The ending seemed fitting for a science-romcom anime and I just want more. A few of the characters are really underdeveloped, but they weren&#039;t hindering the plot so I was fine with it. Plus I&#039;m sure they&#039;d be further developed in the future or in the manga. As for if this show is comparable to Kaguya-sama, I liked both shows for different reasons. Kaguya-sama made the two characters look smart when they were actually just stubborn high school students; this show makes the two leads look super smart, so much so that they are just plain crazy. I&#039;d say both shows resemble some similarities, but then again the context of both shows are so different, and the target audiences are also different. <br />
<br />
All in all, a good watch for seasonal anime fans, and a great show for the geeky weebs out there.

    All Rom and no Com. RikeKoi couldn’t fully cement itself as a really good show for two reasons, its inadequate comedic directing and unfortunately containing the anime classic, the cringey, contrived drama towards the end to create a more...memorable finish? (Seriously though, why does every show feel the need to do this?)<br />
<br />
Just like the number of negatives though, there are two things that do make RikeKoi a pretty acceptable experience to watch. The first is the charming cast of characters (besides the Manga-ka girl, obviously) and the other is the actual romantic progression that is decently fleshed out. RikeKoi is a show about scientists, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331574">
        that is where the comparison to scientists ends. The way our scientist friends are presented is about exactly how you would expect someone who maybe took a few science courses in college and decided to give writing a manga about “science types” a shot. That doesn’t mean to say they are overly obnoxious stereotypes, and a lot of the science tie-ins and references relating to love isn’t shoved down your throat, they are actually quite playful most of the time. The author does in fact have some fascination with science, but it definitely isn&#039;t obsessive Otaku-like. If you were expecting a more accurate depiction of science type people falling in love, you probably would have been stopped at the door judging by how hot all the characters look. The show&#039;s humor mostly relies on the wacky hijinks our main couple get into, they want to prove love can be analytically determined, and that&#039;s the joke, because obviously it can’t. This may sound like it gets stale, but to me the worst part isn’t the style or the continuous set-up of the jokes, it has to be the comedic directing and timing. Of course, some blame also goes to the original creator of the manga. Lets face it, RikeKoi just isn’t very funny, like at all. You will chuckle every now and again, but it’s not even close to being hilarious. You would think that would be a death sentence to a Rom-Com manga adaptation, but in its case surprisingly not. The cast of characters are fine without being funny. They manage to have a good chemistry together, whether it be the main couple Himuro &amp; Yukimura, or Yukimura &amp; Kanade, Ibarada &amp; Kosuke etc. etc. This is mostly because they all have certain archetypes about themselves that work well when clashing with others in the lab. The real main character is easily Himuro, she does a good job containing the joke of the show inside of her character. She&#039;s a devoted scientist, but she can’t shake the feeling that she&#039;s in love. It isn’t like she’s not honest with her feelings, more so she literally just doesn’t know how to process them. Yukimura is all in on the idea he can “prove” whether they are actually in love or not. Kanade is more of the normal emotional thinker, so she can straight man them. Ibarada and Kosuke are a cute little side relationship. This setup managed to be amusing and simple enough for me to want to watch the show to completion. The character design is also very pleasant. One of the best ways to create an engaging couple is to make them look even better when they are next to each other. RikeKoi gets it.<br />
<br />
The show was going well… obviously until the end. They introduce a character in the later episodes that is only there to manufacture a conflict. To RikeKoi’s defense, this seems to be a trait in far too many anime, the rush to produce a dramatic ending. As a result, the “drama” is almost always terrible, almost always cringe, and almost always means ultimately nothing in the end. At a certain point, I was so invested in Yukimura and Himuro you could have given me ANY ending that gives a good meaningful push in their romantic relationship, and I would have been sold. I’m sure most people could agree. So why give us the hardest possible ending to sit through? Ahh, it&#039;s just so disappointing. <br />

    It was poetry in motion, but they blinded each other with science!<br />
<br />
Do you love me? Prove it through science! That’s the mind process of two scientists, who are head over heels for one another but can’t prove it. The solution? Perform various experiments until they can scientifically prove that they do in fact love each other. Because smart people don’t understand how feelings work or something.<br />
<br />
As a comedy this premise works fine enough. But as a romance it fails miserably. Love is a feeling you have for somebody or something. Not a presentation where you have to explain your reasoning. So having them perform these

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331568">
        experiments is pointless and only prevents any romantic development. You’re not so much cheering for them as you are yelling at them to realise their own feelings. It&#039;s the same problem that most anime rom-coms suffer from, and keeps me sighing through most of them. This one was no different. <br />
<br />
What about the characters themselves then? I’m convinced that they’re just robots in disguise. On top of not understanding basic human emotions well. They have the same type of work, believe in the same things and look pretty much the same. They are basically the same person. But something most compelling romances do is make the couple different from one another. So when they get together they complement each other, making them stronger together than they are apart. As such I didn&#039;t find their relationship worth being invested in. So even when their relationship started to go places at the very end, I didn&#039;t care much.<br />
<br />
As a comedy it works at least better. Although I can’t say the style of comedy was something I found to be audibly laugh inducing. But I can see why others would find this to be funny. It’s the sole reason for why I would recommend this to anyone. Because the romance certainly isn’t and neither is the visuals. They’re bland without a trace of passion and creativity to it in my eyes. <br />
<br />
The show failed at bringing anything interesting to the table and the premise ended up being it’s biggest drawback. It&#039;s a very forgettable rom-com that does not deserve your time.<br />

    Perfectly bland. The two leads are both exaggerations of the usual perceptions of scientists, which is executed in such a way that only accentuates how boring those are. <br />
<br />
<br />
The impetus of the story is at least straightforward, so it&#039;s not trying to be anything it&#039;s not. But it&#039;s just boring, as it relies heavily on wanting to see these characters and their romcom go on and develop. However, in the case of this anime, it fails because it&#039;s set up as a monster of the week kind of where there&#039;s some new drama or something that comes along, but what comes along is some silly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326840">
        trope that&#039;s been done plenty of times before. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s an attempt to add actual science to this work, but much of it falls flat to be real or interesting.<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime fails at being comedic, a drama, and a romance. 4/10

    What is love?<br />
Baby don&#039;t hurt me<br />
Don&#039;t hurt me<br />
No more<br />
<br />
What is actually &quot;LOVE&quot;?<br />
<br />
&quot;Love is a complex set of emotions, behaviors, and beliefs associated with strong feelings of affection, protectiveness, warmth, and respect for another person.&quot;<br />
<br />
Perhaps this is an explanation that we all understand. We are all human beings, have feelings and want to love and be loved.<br />
&quot;Why do you love ME?&quot; What is the correct answer to this sentence?<br />
&quot;Because of your character, appearance, kindness etc&quot; such an answer sounds logical and plausible.<br />
But people have a scientific explanation for almost everything in 2020, can our feelings also be analyzed and explained by science? Can we tell from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331638">
        certain physical reactions and fluctuations that we really love someone?<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
Our two scientists, Himuro and Yukimura, want to use the power of science to prove that everything has a rational explanation, including love. They have feelings for each other, but they aren&#039;t sure if you can really call it &quot;LOVE&quot;? With the help of a number of experiments, they try to collect data and evaluate it. All kind of test attempts are made: what does the pulse look like when the other person is next to you, at what angle would a kiss be best, how can you achieve the perfect romantic mood etc. Their friends from their university group help them to carry out the experiments and will also become guinea pigs themself. After the initial skepticism, however, they also become more interested in helping the couple and bringing them together.<br />
<br />
ART:<br />
The animations are very nice to look at, the characters are well presented. Even the difficult mathematical and physical matters are presented in an understandable way with the help of a small, sweet science teddy.<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
The OPs and EDs go well with the anime itself. Even if these are definitely not in the focus, it is relaxing to listen to the music and the song. The OP is sung by Sora Amamiya, who is also the seiyuu for the main female character Himuro. It feels like those are voices from two different people. Impressive!<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
First of all, a WARNING: you will learn more about math and physics here than at school. Well, maybe it&#039;s a little exaggerated, but for someone who enjoys formulas, laws and things like that, they can certainly learn a few things. Those who are familiar with the &quot;Millennium Prize Problems&quot; will find something interesting too. Although these problems have not been solved yet, they are explained to the viewer objectively but understandably. Perhaps a little bit too explicit for an clueless person...<br />
In my opinion, there was a little too much science involved, so the romance has faded somewhat into the background. Nevertheless, we still see many romantic moments between our couple.<br />
<br />
If you want to learn something for your own date, you are probably in the wrong place. Scientifically, the &quot;perfect date and the perfect moment&quot; exists according to the anime, but I would not recommend anyone to try it out in real life. Anyone who prescribes a schedule to the second for his girlfriend during an amusement park date and sets the perfect route with the help of the &quot;Traveling salesman problem&quot; could probably soon be single again in RL. Better not try all those experiments with your girl- or boyfriend. Be smart, take the scientific aspects with you!<br />
<br />
After all, we humans are intelligent living beings and have feelings that certainly cannot be explained by science.<br />

    This is a mediocre anime with a perhaps interesting premise bogged down by poor execution and animation. Or, to sum it up for you simpler weebs, I didn&#039;t like it.<br />
<br />
It was extremely average to the point that it was very, very average. That made no sense. The characters were interesting with some depth to them, the concept itself was decent, but the direction and the poor handling of the anime left a lot to be desired. The idea of always &quot;calculating this, calculating that&quot; quickly grew old as you continued to watch it. <br />
<br />
That said, it was still bearable to watch--you just skip a lot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329919">
        of the boring stuff. I wouldn&#039;t recommend it to anyone, but if you must watch it you won&#039;t really suffer, you&#039;ll just be bored out of your mind. Think Kaguya-sama but with absolutely garbage execution. Kaguya-sama is an example of correct execution (I&#039;ve used execution too much). This is not.

    The joke/plot/everything got old in the first half of episode 1<br />
<br />
I remembered thinking halfway in episode 1 oh this will just be another 1/10 in my entries sigh<br />
<br />
One dimensional like Kaguya san and Takagi san<br />
<br />
You already know they still won&#039;t get what love is until the last episode or for who knows how long the manga is going<br />
<br />
They&#039;ll try to prove their feelings, they still won&#039;t get it, rinse and repeat<br />
<br />
Ibarada is best girl and the only likeable character, the rest are detestable boring and generic<br />
<br />
A complete snoozefest from start to finish<br />
<br />
Having said that even with Ibarada focus would be snoozefest coz her love interest

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331612">
        is just as boring as the main couple<br />
<br />
Kanade is so bad as a straight man role<br />
<br />
1/10

    TL;DR + NO SPOILER REVIEW: <br />
(btw i am new to reviewing) <br />
<br />
Story - 7: Had a nice theme of trying to determine what are the base conditions for someone to be in love with another. The execution of the story was good, but it stayed good, neither improving nor worsening. <br />
Art - 7: Slightly better than what&#039;s out there today, but nothing special.<br />
Sound - 7: Generic OP, ED, and OST. The norm; nothing special or memorable. <br />
Character - 7: Good characters, science-types characters that have the same personality throughout the anime, as well as, other side characters that have personality. <br />
Enjoyment - 8: Was quite

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331570">
        funny at times, using science topics to create jokes was clever. Though it&#039;s not hard to make me laugh. <br />
<br />
Overall: 7.2 (7) <br />
<br />
<br />

FULL REVIEW + SPOILERS: <br />
<br />
Story: Trying to define love with numbers, using rationality in an irrational realm. This made for an interesting story, one of which I thought had a lot of potentials, and whilst this wasn&#039;t a failure, the way the story comes about certainly wasn&#039;t something to be proud of. Science Fell in Love seems to just stick to its ground, making use of a good story by doing nothing with it, leaving viewers with just, well, another rom-com. The story never became anything better because it already set itself in stone within the first few episodes. Just science-types trying to determine what the bases of love are. As the story progresses the relationship between Himuro and Yukimura does begin to have meaning. Though it does so step by step, something which is common in rom coms. However, these steps followed a strict pattern of everything is well until the last moment, of which, afterwards, everything is back to normal again. Something that easily makes a story forgettable. <br />
(7/10) <br />
<br />
Art: Nothing to say here other than it&#039;s better than what&#039;s airing as of the time this review was posted, but not by miles. The same goes for its visuals, it wasn&#039;t the best thing in the world but it&#039;s slightly better than what&#039;s there. It wasn&#039;t very choppy or very rushed. <br />
(7/10) <br />
<br />
Sound: There are no memorable OSTs here. The opening and ending are fine but won&#039;t be something that I will remember. Voice actors did a good job with the characters, but I believe that&#039;s what holds up the sound element in Science Fell in Love. <br />
(7/10) <br />
<br />
Characters: The characters were good, rational science-types who stay true to their character. With Yukimura he is a character of which will go out of his way to do anything for data and research, which I find believe to be a good characteristic that fits well with the science-type. With Himuro, her background was quite generic with the bullied in the past kind of person. I find this kind of background very unrealistic which is sad since it harms Himuro&#039;s character into falling into the generic type of characters. Ibarada is another good character who is cool and a rational thinker aiding both Yukimura and Himuro in their research of love, staying true to science-type personality. Kanade and Inukai were generic characters of the former being infected with moe and the latter being an idiot.  <br />
(7/10) <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Science Fell in Love was enjoyable, its jokes were based around science which gave for humour in science-related topics, which I thought was clever to make light out of topics of which people learn and use every day. Saying this, however, it&#039;s not hard to make me laugh. But the cleverly coordinated jokes made for a good idea which aided this anime into being enjoyable. <br />
(8/10) <br />
<br />
Honestly, you&#039;re not missing out if you don&#039;t watch this, but it&#039;s there to make the time pass by.

    RikeiKoi is a romance comedy about two college students in a research club who want to scientifically prove their romantic attraction towards each other. In general it&#039;s a very lighthearted story with very straight-faced delivery of humor, but other science enthusiasts likely should appreciate the research the author did to include real-world scientific references in the story.<br />
<br />
RikeiKoi&#039;s comedy is a bit less about shock value, and more &quot;matter of fact&quot; exposition.  Rather than focusing primarily on moments of outstanding stupidity or clumsiness, the humor tends to explain situations in outrageously excessive detail. So for example, another romance comedy would specifically set the tone by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331645">
        lovers about to kiss being inconveniently interrupted by unforeseen disturbances. RikeiKoi plays this a bit differently where our main characters about to kiss are not only disturbed but specifically mention how this disturbance creates a suboptimal mood index for kissing. How much you enjoy this show will largely depend on how much you are entertained by this style of comedy.<br />
<br />
Comedy set aside, the show has rather appealing presentation with a colorful while not too over the top art style that is easy on the eyes. With such a heavy focus on real-world science, most of the episodes devote a short segment of time explaining possibly obscure theories or vocabulary in a concise manner. While these segments could be argued as breaking the flow of the comedy, they are nonetheless informative and also help the viewer appreciate the methodology of our two science-type lovers, especially considering how often recurring many science terms are within the story. It&#039;s also somewhat impressive to study the detailed formulas and diagrams the characters use in their pursuit of quantifying love. Even if you aren&#039;t a data obsessed individual by nature, it should be apparent to the audience that the author put a lot of thought in the science, as silly as it may be.<br />
<br />
Something I personally felt the RikeiKoi did well was present memorable characters. Aside from quality performances by both well-known voice actors as well as newer ones, every character had either an outstanding personality or catchphrase that I could identify them for.  One could certainly argue that Yukimura exclaiming &quot;never base decisions on supposition&quot; gets predictable. I personally think it&#039;s this very predictability that lends itself to comedy that has the lightheartedness of a meme. It is both outrageous and refreshing how this character&#039;s ideals are given relevance repeatedly throughout the story in his pursuit to not only define love, but to in fact legitimately open up to his beloved Himuro.<br />
<br />
RikeiKoi is a short and sweet romance comedy that I think the average science and math nerd should find especially interesting. And as a final note: Science-Type Fairy Tales are truly a victory for humanity and RikeiKoi should make more of them.

    Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei shitemita or Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It, yeah right nice work , Yamamoto, Alfred ( the original creator) fro coming up with something as dorky as this series ( web manga/ anime), so here&#039;s the juice:<br />
<br />
Pros: Anime starts with science hot dork Himuro, Ayame declaring her love for an equality good looking dorkster , Yukimura, Shinya and anime ends with the two finally kissing, but not without a lot of pseudo-scientific shenanigans from the both of them.<br />
<br />
Con: Too many pseudo-scientific computations and a lotta BS bush beating and hesitation, that simply just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331585">
        falling in love needs to have some scientific basis, TBH nearly all computations seen here were just very obnoxious to begin with.<br />
 <br />
Verdict (1/10)<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Pros: Himuro, Ayame and Ibarada Ena&#039;s pantyhose fanservices.<br />
<br />
Cons: Yukimura, Shinya and Inukai, Kosuke&#039;s unkempt fashion. <br />
<br />
Verdict (7/10)<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Pros: Characters seiyuus that don&#039;t have to sound like teens and the closing theme &quot;Turing Love&quot; by Akari Nanawo.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cons: Ena Ibarada&#039;s seiyuu that has to  sound like this evil witch. <br />
<br />
Verdict (8/10)<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
Pros: Kanade, Kotonoha who was probably the only one who has the sense and logic to understand the love has to be felt not go through all that shenanigans to proving it scientifically. There was also Ena Ibarada who basically was this kuudere who like to tease Inukai where her actions on the said character provides some sliver lining to this otherwise stupid anime. <br />
<br />
Cons: <br />
<br />
Himuro, Ayame- who has the body and appeal to get any man she wants , but unfortunately she just way too pathetically smart  to put things into simple perspective that she only has let her love be felt by Yukimura, Shinya...<br />
<br />
Yukimura, Shinya- basically either he way too smart or way too stupid that he forgets that love only need to be felt, too smart since he thorough and doesn&#039;t believes in luck or coincident where everything need to be studied and analyze. On the other hand he&#039;s way too stupid that he simply doesn&#039;t know what&#039;s in front of him that and yes that a hot woman who has brains and beauty  but unfortunately just like him they have to go through all kinds of shenanigans when they can just simply get a room and fuck.<br />
<br />
 Inukai, Kosuke _ basically he doesn&#039;t belong here, in fact he most serves as the town&#039;s fool for his otaku antics.<br />
<br />
 Ikeda, Professor- another outta place character, who serves as a pun for Bruce Banner, in fact him being this lab head was way very ridiculous, cu&#039;z one can&#039;t say if he&#039;s the science guy or a dorkster with muscles  ....<br />
<br />
Ararika Yamamoto- Ok so she serves as this antagonist but unfortunately she&#039;s just a poor one giving that her motives were just poor, I mean it was obvious that she isn&#039;t a science type so how did she fit as one of Ikeda&#039;s alumnus??? <br />
<br />
Verdict (1/10)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Pros: I was more into Himuro, Ayame&#039;s struggle to make Yukimura to simple fall in love with her and there is that looks where she makes men wanna have sex with her...<br />
<br />
Cons: I felt like watching this as a chore.<br />
<br />
Verdict (3/10)<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
Verdict (3/10)<br />
<br />
This was one such anime where the theme science and romance doesn&#039;t mix , in fact the part where Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It, doesn&#039;t make any sense at all, cu&#039;z the science part doesn&#039;t prove a thing in fact if one would ask as to why bullies take one geeks like that of Himuro and Yukimura??? Well, just watching this would be enough to understand why , cu&#039;z this anime/ web manga was another way of adding salt to the wounds when it describes geeks or dorks whom were already having to face everyday life of being bullied...So, do I recommend this????? That would be a big &quot;NO&quot; in fact don&#039;t even think about having a season 2 of this very dorky anime and also they&#039;d be better off ending the web manga ASAP.     <br />

    There’s no real grand, or even minuscule message that the show delivers when it comes to love despite all the data examination and rumination. It’s for the most part a par for the course mediocre romantic comedy with some science strewn about to give it some sort of differentiation.<br />
<br />
The plot mostly consists of the entire group doing experiments to quantify what love really is. It mostly has the experiments devolving down to gaffs and goofs and not much else. The experiments aren&#039;t even the science portion of the show, but rather it’s the theoretics and laws that are thrown around; usually accompanied by a bear

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331575">
        to unnecessarily explain it. Mostly used to pad out the shows run time as they provide as much substance as just name dropping the theories and moving on, and it’s also the most patronizing shit ever. Aside from all this, the only thing that is noteworthy about the show is that it circumvents some story tropes via lamp-shading or parody. It would be a very admirable feat if it weren’t for the fact that it falls into similar trappings later on.<br />
<br />
The characters aren’t much better, they might even be a bit worse. None of them are really worth listing off due to how 2-dimensional they all are, so here’s just how it is for all of them. They all follow their standard personalities from their introduction till the end without much more characterization, or development that hadn&#039;t already been obvious. Although most of them aren’t really annoying (at least up to a point), they are all still just flat forgettable characters that are a dime a dozen in this genre.<br />
<br />
I would say that it’s an ok show but much of the last third really makes me want to say otherwise. Just a bunch of unnecessary drama on that part in order to create fake tension, even though it ends on a happy but predictable note. It’s definitely isn’t bad, but you most certainly can find some other mediocre rom-com shows that are better than this.

    This is charming in it&#039;s own way honestly.<br />
<br />
 While I&#039;m not much of a science buff, but it&#039;s the characters is what makes this anime honestly. Who would&#039;ve thought two super smart people, would be so dumb over something. It&#039;s hilarious. But it&#039;s not just those two who can be given credit over being wonderful characters to add to this show. You&#039;ve got a sweet girl who isn&#039;t clueless on love in Kanade, an otaku in Kosuke, and a calm and smart Ibarada. <br />
<br />
With these brand of characters together, it makes for a very entertaining show, from just how the two mains whom are in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327056">
        love have to calculate everything, even if it&#039;s simple to understand, to even the other character&#039;s reactions too, it&#039;s a good laugh honestly. Very charming as well.<br />
<br />
The music of the show is nicely done too. Really fits the show. Along with the art is really pretty to look at. Very pleasing. As the characters and scenes look stunning honestly. I really love it.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d honestly recommend it, I spent a bit watching back to back episodes, and I only wish more were out already.

    &quot;What is this thing called Love?...using SCCCCCIENCE~!!&quot;<br />
<br />
LA will say it directly about Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei shitemita. and that it&#039;s one of those strain of animes similar to Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen, the biggest difference however is that our main couple of Ayame Himuro voiced by Sora Amamiya and Shinya Yukimura voiced by Yuuma Uchida actually &quot;spits it out&quot; and their endeavors to &quot;scientifically&quot; and &quot;mathematically&quot; find their having &quot;spit it out&quot; to each other. Ohhh this isn&#039;t spoilers by the way, they do this in the FIRST episode!. So in the Ikeda Lab where they work as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336619">
        university students as well as their fellow lab members helps Himuro and Yukimura to &quot;find love&quot;.<br />
<br />
Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei shitemita. is a very character-centric anime, what with the focus being entirely romantically angled and ALOT of the comedy comes from adorkable Himuro and Yukimura having zero romantic experiences and them having their rebuttals usually being &quot;long rants with scientific and mathematical equations&quot; as a result and to say that can relate in ALOT of ways to the two and their rebuttals though a running gag, the anime managed to diversify this running gag quite well only added to the comedy and the characters in general.<br />
<br />
Now, since this is a character centric anime, let&#039;s go over them shall we?. First off would be LA&#039;s favourite character and waifu of the anime, Ayame Himuro, being a kuudere with more deredere than kuu and with her appeal coming from her reactions (and let&#039;s face it the more tamer of the kuu compared to Yukimura) and her appearance and posing making LA remember of a certain spy idol that LA likes *ahem*, nonetheless Himuro was definitely LA&#039;s favourite character of the anime. Shinya Yukimura, much like Himuro but aforementioned is a bit more kuu than dere though he has his moments as well, for the most part both Himuro and Yukimura&#039;s scientific relationship is the major focal point of the anime and LA could relate to them in some level (or you know...LA ships them as well). Next is our audience surrogate Kanade Kotonoha voiced by Natsuko Hara, the most sane member of Ikeda Lab and is &quot;one&quot; of the strongest characters and replies in kind, though she was the most sanest of members of the lab, she is relegated to one liner to the rest of the cast antics and delivered well nonetheless. <br />
<br />
Next is the beta couple of Kosuke Inukai voiced by Jun Fukushima and Ena Ibarada voiced by Nichika Oomori, Kosuke is a hardcore dating sim otaku who&#039;s in love with a 2D character while Ena is his childhood friend who constantly likes to tease him about his childhood as an advantage and Ena also liking yaoi sometimes pits Kosuke and Yukimura in romantic situations fo the lolz. Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei shitemita. and any romance anime does well is not only make the man couple interesting but the beta couple too, then it&#039;s a VERY good romance anime and with Kosuke and Ena, LA can clearly say you want to root for them too much like Yukimura and Himuro...-sigh- if only Kosuke wasn&#039;t the butt monkey of the lab and wasn&#039;t eying a 2D character (*ahem* not that LA is one to talk *AHEM*). Finally we have Professor Ikeda voiced by Ryoutarou Okiayu, being the lab&#039;s namesake and owner...he...uhhhhh....gets BUFF.<br />
<br />
Oh and best of all Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei shitemita. is informative as when Yukimura or Himuro comes along with mathematical or scientific jargon a bear named Rikekuma comes along that explains it though reluctant almost like Rikekuma voiced by Momo Asakura knows we&#039;re not THAT stupid and can follow along thus Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei shitemita can be a VERY informative anime.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless the cast of Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei shitemita. was VERY well done with the minimal cast allowing for lots of character interactions and LOTS of character and relational screentime with the minimal cast allowing for more comedic hijinks along the way as well.<br />
<br />
Now the anime for the better half of the anime follows an episodic format where Yukimura and Himuro conducts romance experiments and the like and it&#039;s what you expect, what LA didn&#039;t expect is that some off handed remarks actually coming along in some latter episodes when things gets &quot;serious&quot; in some sense. When Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei shitemita. does get into more serious drama arc in the &quot;Training Camp arc&quot;, we also gets introduced to one more character, that being Arika Yamamoto voiced by Yui Ogura and let&#039;s say she makes her motives VERY CLEAR. Yeah the only major nitpick LA will say to this anime is it&#039;s handling of it&#039;s &quot;only villain&quot; as she makes it&#039;s bluntly clear she&#039;s a villain out to sabotage Himuro and Yukimura&#039;s relationship, sure the only defence LA will say is, why not the change of pace with a villain and it is noted through word of god that Arika is the author&#039;s avatar thus write what you know goes into this, but LA will say that Arika makes her motives known in her INTRODUCTION episode, it&#039;s obvious she will be up to something and a red herring is null and void. But yes LA&#039;s own defence of a change of pace does make Himuro and Yukimura&#039;s relationship rocky be interesting, only furthers that Arika has a point, LA just wished she covered her motives up better for the audience instead of blatantly saying it.<br />
<br />
Zero-G animated Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei shitemita. and boy was LA surprised by their animation, it was crisp, great comical facial reactions, good character designs and though the backgrounding was probably the least interesting thing they did, for Zero-G it&#039;s a HUGE step up from their previous works like Dorei-ku the Animation and One Room. If anything this is one of Zero-G&#039;s most polished works LA has seen from them and LA thusly give major props to them in the animation department.<br />
<br />
The voice cast were ALL great, from Sora Amamiya as best waifu Himuro and nailing her kuudere to Yuuma Uchida&#039;s mostly kuu cadence through Yukimura. Nichika Oomori channeling her Yurine from Jashin Dropkick in giving dry one liners and generally being the tease to Natsuko Hara&#039;s witty one liners as Kanade, Jun Fukushima&#039;s boisterously genki cadence as Kosuke was pretty good with Momo Asakura as Rikekuma sorta following suit similar to Nichika Oomori&#039;s cadence but in a brighter tone as it were and finally Yui Ogura as Arika Yamamoto was very well done as the sheep in wolf clothing. LA LOVED this voice cast, especially from Natsuko Hara, Nichika Oomori, Yuuma Uchida and MVP Sora Amamiya.<br />
<br />
If your craving more animes in the same veins of Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen, but with a science and math edge towards it, much like Chika and Kaguya being waifu&#039;s, then Ena and most definitely Himuro will be yours too with Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei shitemita. because you know what? What Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen has still teased us with a kiss between the main couple, Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei shitemita. did it in TWELVE, heck they CONFESSED IN ONE. LA loves both animes by the way as they BOTH handle love differently, Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen looking at psychologically and with Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei shitemita looking at love scientifically and mathematically.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s the formula for love?...well...<br />
<br />

C8H11NO2+C10H12N2O+C43H66N12O12S2 just don&#039;t take it high doses or you&#039;ll get cases of schizophrenia, extreme paranoia, and insanity.<br />

This review is mostly SPOILER FREE.<br />
<br />
The anime in a nutshell, is pretty much analogous to an existing anime [1] with equally (if not more) enjoyable characters. A major difference being that the characters are in grad school instead of high school.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
The story is pretty much that of a generic romantic comedy where the two main characters are in love each other but the entire series is about their journey of getting together. Where this anime makes its mark is that the two

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331706">
        characters already know they like each other but are trying to &quot;prove&quot; their love for each other in a scientific way. Now the scientific way is usually rigorous and hence needs a lot of experiments and data collection to establish a result. The 12 episodes essentially involve different forms of data collection.<br />
<br />
Art and sound: 8.5/10<br />
I feel all anime has in general reached a level of art and sound which usually won&#039;t be considered bad. What would make the anime&#039;s art distinctive is if they try an art style out of the ordinary (see e.g. [2]). This one does not have any distinguishing trait in terms of art and sound, but is overall well designed and drawn with good quality sound. A notable mention is the ending song of the anime, which is quite catchy.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
The characters in the anime are all part of the scientific community, specifically researching in data science. I am a grad student in engineering myself, and hence these characters and their daily lives are very relatable for myself. The grad students in the lab are all about scientific reasoning and experiments. They also mentor some undergrads in the lab which makes this all the more realistic.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
The very fact that you can find a possibility of scientific study in in eroge tells how smart the story is, and how research knows no bounds. The references to famous theorems from math and computer science bump up the enjoyment further. I personally could get most of the references, and if not -- it basically expanded my knowledge, so it is a win-win.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
The story and characters are super cute. If you are in a university, you will most certainly enjoy this anime and get most of the references. If you are in school, you will hopefully realize how awesome research culture is, and get gravitated towards science.<br />

    RikeKoi is just another RomCom. There is nothing special about it. Its high concept is entirely superficial, its specs are completely average by today&#039;s standards, and its most redeeming quality is the busty waifu on the cover. I can&#039;t recommend that you watch this show. Here&#039;s why:<br />
<br />
-[Not Smart]-<br />
RikeKoi is not a smart show. It isn&#039;t about science, and it isn&#039;t for people who respect science as an idea. RikeKoi is yet another anime following the trend of media raping science of its meaning and purpose. Do not go into this show thinking that it has anything to do with science. <br />
<br />
Listen, I&#039;m not a scientist,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331684">
        but I, like many others, am very interested in knowing about science. I have no desire to study a specific field in hopes of uncovering the world&#039;s secrets, but I am absolutely enticed by the idea of knowing information. For people like me shows that market themselves as science-based are immediately more appealing than those who don&#039;t.<br />
<br />
As a trivia-craving autist, I can verify with 100% certainty that this show is not for people like us. Go watch Vsauce, or maybe Dr. Stone if you really want to watch an anime.<br />
<br />
-[Not Funny (didn&#039;t laugh)]-<br />
RikeKoi is not funny. Obviously, this is just my opinion, however, I can say with a fair bit of confidence that the show wasn&#039;t trying to be funny either. Unless your sense of humor is basically &quot;Ha. That&#039;s cute. They blushed.&quot;, you&#039;ll be left watching 60 minutes of anime and laughing 1 time. Now I&#039;m not too good at math, but that equates to about 1 laugh per hour. I could laugh more times in an hour if you just locked me up in a sensory deprivation chamber. Not funny, didn&#039;t laugh.<br />
<br />
-[Bad Writing]-<br />
Characters are inconsistent and the writing is cliched and predictable. Yukimura and Himuro&#039;s scientifically oriented mindsets aren&#039;t believable because they drop them on a whim. This makes the story&#039;s progression rather meaningless, since the pursuit of truth often takes a backseat to &#039;fuck it, lets just do this because it&#039;s more entertaining&#039;. Love can be pretty easy to point out on a biological level, since your brain responds uniquely to love with chemicals. I mean, I know the show would be pretty boring if this was the acknowledged, but that&#039;s not my problem, it&#039;s the writer&#039;s.<br />
<br />
Also, fucking cliches are everywhere. Every character is an archetype. They all act predictably. The story progresses predictably. There&#039;s even a section in episode 3 that is absolutely done-to-death. The writers try to play the cliche off with self-awareness, but that doesn&#039;t excuse its use as a plot element that will inevitably come up later.<br />
<br />
-[Everything Else + The End]-<br />
<br />
Presentation was good, not outstanding. The artstyle is follows modern norm. The characters, as previously mentioned, lack depth. I suspect that they probably don&#039;t change by the end, since it isn&#039;t necessary to progress the story. Yada yada, review over. <br />
<br />
Overall, this show was just a typical RomCom. Ordinarily, this wouldn&#039;t be a big deal, but I waited 3 months to watch this show only to be disappointed within 3 episodes. I&#039;m actually kind of sad. 5/10

    Introduction:<br />
• Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei shitemita is a fun and enjoyable seasonal anime that fills the romcom slot. Rather than putting major focus on either the romance or comedy aspect, this Anime adds science to the mix instead, providing a unique experience.<br />
<br />
Story (7):<br />
• Basic romcom premise, two main characters like each other and chaos ensues.<br />
• In this case, the science aspect adds a unique twist to the typical romcom premise which brings the comedy up a notch.<br />
• I don&#039;t expect to see any resolution on the romance side of things, and if there does happen to be some resolution, it will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327693">
        probably be very weak.<br />
• The science as previous mention is fairly realistic and grounded in reality. Lot&#039;s of real life references are made along with explanations to what they mean. The way they do the explanations kind of annoys me, it is sudden and done in a very strange manner.<br />
<br />
Art (7):<br />
• Not much to be said in this category. Art looks good but nothing special. Animations are typical as well, some movement with mostly static shots. It does the job and does not take you out of the experience. However, the opening theme does have good visuals to it.<br />
<br />
Sound (7):<br />
• Slightly better than the art but not enough to reach an 8. The opening and ending themes are both well made and catchy with the opening being the better of the two in my opinion.<br />
• The OSTs used are average and forgettable but get the job done.<br />
<br />
Characters (8):<br />
• This is where the series shines. Characters all have unique personalities and quirks. This makes for fun and interesting interactions between each other. You have the two science types that struggle to function in normal circumstances and over analyze everything. You have the two otakus that like the mess with each other and cause trouble. You have the freshman girl that just joined them who has a more level headed attitude that struggles to keep up with their craziness. And recently, the absent minded yet polite teacher that turns insane at the drop of a hat. All in all, you can expect some crazy scenarios that you will not find in typical romcoms.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8):<br />
• I am personally enjoying this Anime a lot and look forward to it every week. As a disclaimer, I tend to be in the target audience for these types of shows but I am attempting to review this without any bias.<br />
<br />
Overall (7):<br />
• Considering all the previous categories and the score I have given them, I have decided to give the Anime a 7 as of now. This is a score that is subject to change, but I am pretty confident it will stay as a 7.<br />
• I recommend this show to fans of romance, comedy, and science. People that are expecting actual romance will be disappointed. If you are expecting a complete story or a season 2, you will also likely to be disappointed.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
• Definitely a good seasonal show that is worth watching but not a stand out in particular.<br />
• My first ever review as well, feedback is appreciated.

    I personally find it very, very boring.<br />
<br />
The idea is somewhat cute, the artwork itself is actually good, and here and then it is indeed somewhat funny. But, it`s really quite boring to listen to and to watch. I listened and watched and really tried but ... nope ... I didn`t feel entertained at all. <br />
<br />
I am not sure who could possibly enjoy ongoing boring talk about hypotheses of signs of love and bla<br />
<br />
The characters were actually very good. But the ongoing awful talk and hypothesizing are just so dumb that I almost fell asleep and it makes the characters also suck. Such a pity for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341228">
        them :)<br />
<br />
And being forced to write so long reviews is annoying, too. A couple of words would have been more than enough to summarize why I don`t like the anime: Boring talk, nothing really happens... Therefore, difficult to follow and I almost asleep - so, dropped.

    5 - There was something you enjoyed. Still a bit forgettable, but not a waste of time.<br />
<br />
So, this honestly is a decent comedy with some educational references at times. The premise of the story is fine, and honestly... Himuro Ayame might be one of the cutest 2D girls I&#039;ve ever seen, and I&#039;m not a &quot;2D girl&quot; type of guy at all. But the way her pony tails wags in excitement for her love interest is great.<br />
<br />
But anywaaaayyys, the comedy is fine but it never really made me chuckle or laugh. We all know that the essence of a comedy is laughter, and if it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337367">
        can&#039;t evoke that then it isn&#039;t very good. That&#039;s the main problem for this anime. The jokes aren&#039;t great, and the situations aren&#039;t really funny. Just somewhat interesting.<br />
<br />
However, the plot is still somewhat interesting, and it is nice seeing that there is some depth to the story. That definitely helps this from being a 4 or lower. Ultimately, the conclusion of this anime was worthy of a head nod in approval. The final episode was solid, and it was enjoyment. It was light harded, and it felt justified watching the entirety the anime. <br />
<br />
I did not come out of this anime feeling like I wasted my time. It&#039;s a rom-com anime that doesn&#039;t have much of the com, but the plot isn&#039;t awful so it passes. <br />
<br />
This would probably be best watched in English dubbed as background noise. Maybe something you put on when trying to fall asleep if you&#039;re that type of person. I definitely wouldn&#039;t recommend, but I also wouldn&#039;t be like, &quot;hey, don&#039;t watch this anime!&quot; It&#039;s a nice in-between of huge indifference.
