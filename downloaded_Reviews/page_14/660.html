    Well maybe i&#039;m to early for everyone here. It&#039;s my first review on myanimelist and i know i&#039;m not got at it. Well As you know the airing of Lupin III (2015) or as the italian title states:Lupin III: L&#039; Avventura italiana started airing on Italian TV  called Italia 1 only 4 weeks ago and it&#039;s currently on the 14 episodes. I can say that The begining was for like wait What ?<br />
<br />
Well the story centers Italy as the state of love and art that&#039;s what all of the anime is about. Well in this season they added a character to the crew well

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200266">
        sort of. Because i don&#039;t want to spoil the fun for you who still didn&#039;t saw the new episodes.<br />
<br />
Well let me say i&#039;m honored that the Anime aired in Italy since i live near Italy i can watch it everyweek. The story dosen&#039;t really seem so bad but sometimes i get the feeling that the plot just runs to fast.<br />
<br />
While the Art is something i appreciate that they made improvments well it is HD and all but still i think it could be better.<br />
<br />
I know i&#039;m more of a guy who likes almost everything that is in the anime but i can say i can feel myself there in Italy with Lupin.<br />
<br />
I would love to say more but i would&#039;t want to spoil the fun of watching. Thank you for your time reading this.

    Honestly I have never seen any of the previous Lupin the thirds, but I can tell you this anime is absolutely stunning. Something I looked forward to every week, when it was airing.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
The anime jumps from its one episode driven story to its overarching italian dream story. I enjoyed every single solo episode, thrilling, exciting, and overall masterpieces for style and the audacity Lupin brings to the table. When Lupin wasn&#039;t present, the characters still shined with their own unique personalities. Each episode had a small storyline or mystery to solve, and Lupin pretty much owned the stage every episode he was in. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212623">
        dream story was rather confusing, and takes away from the other episodes, but it still allowed Lupin to shine through with his character so it only brought the score down to a 9.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
The womens&#039; hair, oh my god, the colors are amazing. The animation was smooth. Every character had their own distinct art and distinct identity with the art.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
Everything was on point. The soundtrack was classy and reminiscent of Italy. This 4th blue jacket nailed it.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
Although sometimes the characters were bound to a certain emotion. Jigen with fear/nervousness, Goemon for his honor, etc... Those emotions were done spectacularly and when they had episodes centered around them. And Lupin himself brought the whole show together, his entire aura was great for the series as a whole.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
You will be laughing or thinking deeply every moment. I loved probably every second of the anime, and sometimes the clever plot twists made you smile at the end of the day.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
Even if you have not watched the previous 100+ Lupin episodes, this Italian arc is a masterpiece on its own.

    Lupin is like a goldmine of potential when you’re fanatic of adventure. Taking place in the country of Italy with a diverse cultural background, the series invites anyone who is interested in a journey filled with daring risks. I’d like to see this series not just as a revisit of the franchise but also a show that recreates adventure as a whole. Lupin III (also known as Lupin the Third) is a series that is easily recommendable for anyone but those who is interested in adventure will be in for a big treat.<br />
<br />
It’s truly like a miracle. The show takes place in the refreshing country

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218119">
        of Italy and San Marino. Behind the beautiful mountainous landscapes lies a deeply cultured world ready to be explored. The main protagonist is the titular character, Lupin. Anyone who is familiar with the franchise will recognize him easily although Lupin now has a blue coat to make him look him even more fabulous. Known for his mischievous and lascivious personality, viewers will easily be able to see some of his intentions throughout the show. Of course, there are others that joins him on his adventures such Jigen, Goemon, Fujiko, and the new girl Rebecca. While some of these characters will be like a walk down memory lane, Rebecca is a new character that is a tricky pony to get used to.<br />
<br />
The first episode establishes a bizarre relationship as Lupin and Rebecca is bounded by marriage. This may come as a bit peculiar as we hardly know anything about Rebecca. Until of course, we learn some of her true intentions. From there, we can dive into Lupin III like an episodic adventure. The structure of the show chronicles Lupin’s life style as he attempts to make daring getaways with his usual thieving habits, attempts to woo Fujiko, or otherwise occasionally helping out others. The show also establishes Lupin as a very crafty individual. What makes him fun to watch is that even though he is a mastermind of innovative stealth tactics, he sometimes lets his own personal agendas and weakness (such as women) get in the way of his goals. This often translates into a twisty scenario that gets much more complicated than it should be. But hey, that’s just the nature of Lupin and what makes him such a fun character to watch. <br />
<br />
Despite Lupin’s thieving habits, he is a humble person and does not tolerate injustice. During his adventures, we see that he seeks to punish violent criminals or individuals who truly wishes to inflict harm to society. This makes him somewhat more of a hero but most people in the world sees him as the reputable #1 thief. His relationship with others has a wide range of diversity. The most complicated may be Fujiko as Lupin often finds himself trying to woo her yet she puts him into undesirable circumstances. On the other hand, we got Daisuke Jigen, a man who is loyal to Lupin. Unlike Fujiko, he helps Lupin and often times when he needs it the most. The two shares a bonding relationship while on the road and his skills of driving is invaluable to their missions. Goemen is also an interesting character with his silent presence yet packs a deadly arsenal of techniques with his sword. <br />
<br />
Obviously, a show about a thief also has people hunting for them. The most significant character is Zenigata. His obsession to capture Lupin is very entertaining as the two are sometimes locked in a cat-and-mouse game. Think of it like Tom and Jerry but with a lot of more twists. The adventurous structure of the show sometimes pits them together in unlikely circumstances as well that really shows their relationship. I have to admit though, Rebecca is a character that I find hard to adapt with at first. Most people are probably more familiar with Fujiko so introducing Rebecca is somewhat of a risk. Plus, she has a spoiled personality and often hard to please. As time went on, I find more appreciation for Rebecca especially in the later episodes when we see a deeper side of her character. In a way, she is also like Fujiko with her crafty mind and ability to manipulate events in her favor.<br />
<br />
A frequent question for fans is whether you can watch this show without any experience of the predecessors. It’s sort of a two-way sort of scenario. On one hand, you can watch it to enjoy this series as a standalone with the Italian adventures. Most episodes are standalone and easy to understand even with some of the background storytelling. On the other hand, you’ll probably get a better experience if you understand the characters better from the previous series. Honestly though, this show can sometimes be so entertaining that you’ll often forget about the story. It’s just that damn fun.<br />
<br />
In terms of technical visuals, the show may seem lackluster at first. Don’t let it fool you. The show isn’t designed to look like a Makoto Shinkai-level type of blockbuster. Rather, it retains the classic feel and that’s what Lupin is about. It’s stylistic and very well done. Plus, the characters are designed in ways that feels nostalgic. They still retain what fans may be used to such as Fujiko’s seductive fashion, Goemon’s trademark samurai clothes, or Zenigata’s professionalism. The background and design of Italy is also filled with culture that really gives the adventurous feel. It’s spellbinding just seeing some of the architectural designs that almost makes you feel like you’re there yourself. Add that with the neat action and this show really is something to take home.<br />
<br />
Did I mention classic already in this review? Let me mention it again then. The soundtrack is classic. No, not the type of classic like it’s remixed. Rather, it’s refreshing with how this show is done. From the theme songs to the jazz-beat music, this show can easily be put on repeat every episode with the music. Character voice mannerism is also stellar that matches with their performances. I’d often find myself laughing at the humor just because of Lupin’s role and his voice matches perfectly as a thief. That same goes for Fujiko, a woman that defines what manipulation is all about. <br />
<br />
The waiting is definitely worth it. Even though the original series debuted many years ago, Lupin III still reminds us why adventure can be so much fun. From the thrilling action to the marvelous character performances, it’s a show that anyone can easily dive into. Rebecca can be a character that some may find irritating at first. However, I’d give it more time as she does get a decent amount of characterization later. While on the way, you’ll see just how bizarre Lupin’s adventure can really get in a world like no other.

    Honestly Lupin III is a classic! The storyline and characters are really something. Lupin is a master thief but also a gentleman at heart. The storyline is clever and the endings are always unexpected each episode. Many anime have used Lupin as inspiration, heck Scooby Doo spent ages using Lupin III as inspiration. Lupin III pretty much has all my boxes ticked. Loveable main characters, loveable opposing characters and storylines that will take unexpected turns. Lupin is a huge and important anime in Japan and it should get much more attention outside the homeland. It’s like going back in time and seeing the history of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336441">
        where many anime bloomed after this. Even though this is the 2015 Lupin, it still as the classy style and feel to it. <br />
<br />
Honestly just give this show a try. It grows on you and you’ll love all the characters and their unique personalities.

    Currently on ep 12 so this might be considered an early review. As a casual watcher type, I&#039;m very picky with what to waste my time on. I only watch if it&#039;s popular enough to catch some hype, but I only keep watching if it&#039;s interesting regardless of how hyped it is. But it didn&#039;t even get the hype I was expecting of a classic. And I wasn&#039;t interested since I thought it belonged in my childhood and my childhood alone as I completely forgot everything about it. So now I come to this with a fresh perspective.<br />
<br />
The reason I picked it up was because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206104">
        I was with someone who watched it. A part of me feels I would have dropped it at ep 4 if it wasn&#039;t for him. (And I wouldn&#039;t have found out that the official Japanese pronunciation is LUPAN not LUPIN.) But who would have kept watching if it was actually that bad right? Now on to my review:<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
The story is simple enough, crazy and fun. e.g. physics-defying anime logic but you learn to embrace it in animes like this. You will always get reminded Lupin is a skilled thief so I just expected him to walk off with treasure as that detective guy earnestly swears to get him &quot;next time.&quot; But it&#039;s not like that, it&#039;s actually a very heartwarming series. I&#039;m under the impression it&#039;s what young people would describe as &quot;getting the feels.&quot; I&#039;m pleasantly surprised.<br />
<br />
ART:<br />
Art is nice. Looks like the Lupin I remember without looking too old and outdated. The ombre hair effects looks very appealing and the background work is charming. There were moments when quality dropped a bit but it happens to all anime.<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
BGM is funky and groovy. The intro is beautiful in acoustic versions that I stumbled on by accident online but I&#039;m a bigger fan of the ending song.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
There are quite a lot of main male characters and you can tell they all have good hearts. The 2 female characters are ok enough. I seem to remember from childhood that Fujiko was a sex symbol but I can&#039;t remember if she was more than that and so I have no clue if we&#039;ll see her develop beyond being a greedy voluptuous thief in this series. New characters are usually met with scepticism since they are unfamiliar but I don&#039;t mind Rebecca, she does what she wants and she does it by herself, she doesn&#039;t annoy me WHICH IS A BIG DEAL as it could have easily went in that direction I feel. She contributes something besides money. Maybe that&#039;s why. Hmmmm<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: It&#039;s definitely fun. Perfect for someone not wanting anything too serious and plot heavy to watch e.g. mecha and dystopia themed anime where every other sentence is an explanation. I can tell why a young me would enjoy something like this. Each episode is different but remains cohesive with the rest. It doesn&#039;t feel like it&#039;s dragging on, I appreciate the pace. And a young me wouldn&#039;t understand any of the adult themes anyway. (e.g. where one minor character was implied to have been a sex worker against her will.)(Don&#039;t even cry Spoiler Alert as it&#039;s not even crucial to the story at all.) The antics would have seemed funny and unbelievable and awesome to my younger self. e.g dodging bullets and hitching helicopter rides. But the real heart of this anime is obviously the nice happy endings that leave you with a good taste in your mouth.<br />
<br />
But although I barely have any qualms about this anime, I really don&#039;t feel like investing more time on it after I watch ep 13 (if I&#039;m reading the preview right, it seems that that episode will wrap up Italian Dream)<br />
<br />
I&#039;m just a casual watcher, it&#039;s time to move on. We&#039;ve had our fun but I&#039;m not interested in keeping this relationship going. Despite being well-paced, the plot doesn&#039;t urge me to watch more. I&#039;m not dropping it because it&#039;s bad, it&#039;s more so to free up time for other anime. See other people. <br />
<br />
My advice is definitely give it a try, you don&#039;t have to put a ring on it but getting to know the series a bit really wouldn&#039;t hurt your anime knowledge as this is clearly a classic revival.<br />
<br />
I give it a 7/10.

    Well, where do we start off? Let me just write as much as I can about this gorgeous series. Just before I begin rambling about why this anime is absolutely amazing, I would like to state that I may be a bit bias as this is one of my, if not, favourite anime series. <br />
<br />
First of all, comes the story. Its plot being led by Lupin and his team is very unique. It focuses on one main arch, in this case, it&#039;ll be Italy. Between each episode is a completely different, new, unique story, while also being linked to the main arch. Furthermore, the mystery

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244639">
        and thrill of what and how Lupin finds and steals the treasure is amazingly entertaining and always makes you come back for more.<br />
<br />
Second, comes the art style. There isn&#039;t much to say about the art style because it&#039;s unquestionably beautiful. While being crisp and pleasurable, it mildly keeps the old style that blends perfectly to the genre of the anime, being an adventure, treasure and a bunch more.<br />
<br />
To add on, the sound fits perfectly to the &#039;tone&#039; of the anime. Being a thief anime with the hint of mystery fits consummately with the classical music and beats. <br />
<br />
The characterisation in this masterpiece is &#039;sui generis&#039;, meaning unique and individual. To begin with, the members of Lupin gang are all unique in the sense that their attitudes, goal, personality, abilities are highly distinctive. Not only that, but other characters like Rebecca or Mr. Nix are very different and each character has their own backstory with ups and downs.<br />
<br />
Overall I will have to give this anime 10/10! Easy score. It&#039;s really intriguing to watch and exciting to watch. If you&#039;re a mystery and adventure fanatic like me then this anime is a jackpot for you.<br />
<br />

    &quot;The Birth of the Cool&quot; may have occurred with Miles Davis, but in the realm of anime and manga we owe it to Monkey Punch and his bizarre tales of Lupin the Third for laying the foundation of &quot;Cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don’t know what it is about recent Lupin III specials and shows, but there’s a strange tendency for the writers to attempt a complex, philosophical plot that feels very out of place with the classic cast of characters that make up the Lupin III franchise. Thinking about it, even decades ago we had plots like this, many specials attempting to delve into the supernatural or sci-fi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review232901">
        along with philosophical dialogue. As much as I enjoyed The Woman Called Fujiko Mine, it is extremely guilty of this in the later episodes and it really just feels uncomfortable. That all said, Lupin III is inherently a stupid-fun show and when you don’t try to take the writing seriously you’ll be just fine.<br />
<br />
Lupin III Part 4 is full of hit-or-miss episodes. I have to say that the character Rebecca usually contributes to an episode being one of the misses. Another thing about the majority of Lupin III specials and the recent shows; there’s an apparent need from the writers to add a main character that literally no Lupin fan gives a shit about. Usually it’s handled fairly well, like the weird cop kid in The Woman Called Fujiko Mine. He’s a secondary character that doesn’t do any harm to any episodes. However, in Part 4, episodes based almost entirely around this new character Rebecca end up being completely skippable and I happened to fast-forward through a few scenes here and there that I just couldn’t keep watching. I enjoyed her in the finale episode at-least with the “subtle” references to Castle of Cagliostro, but otherwise the show would have benefitted from her being written out early on.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, writers still know how to handle the main cast of characters that we all know and love. The episodes that hit are those beautiful heist episodes with the classic setup of Lupin, Jigen, and Goemon going through life-and-death situations to steal some great artifact or defeat some whacky villain while Fujiko shows up at the end to swipe the reward right from Lupin’s grasp. During all this, Zenigata is doing his best to capture the gang or often teaming up with them to capture the “antagonist of the week.” It’s the system that every Lupin fan has to adore, as it is what the entirety of the early Lupin III TV shows consist of.<br />
<br />
Overall, this addition to the Lupin III franchise is decent. It’s not nearly as good as The Woman Called Fujiko Mine but it always makes me happy to see the franchise still going strong. This is a show that’s more than forty years old, and Lupin the Third and his gang are still as lovable as ever.<br />

    TL;DR – As good as any entry point into the sprawling Lupin franchise, the fourth TV series should appeal to old fans &amp; new audiences alike. It&#039;s not without flaws, but is a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
Few characters from what some consider the golden period of children&#039;s TV anime (1960s – 1980s) have maintained a presence in pop-culture like Lupin III. Despite this being the first full TV series in over thirty years, a steady stream of films, specials, crossovers &amp; marketing tie-ins have helped keep the world&#039;s greatest master thief in the popular conscience.<br />
<br />
But while many may know of Lupin &amp; his gang, this latest

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231262">
        season likely represents the first opportunity for many, including this reviewer, to see them in action. Seemingly aware of this, this forth series sets out to juggle the potentially conflicting objectives of appealing to a new generation of potential Lupin fans, while giving older fans a reason to watch. Fortunately, it for the most part pulls it off.<br />
<br />
The first episode opens to the surprise of many, including Lupins companions Fujiko, Jigen &amp; Goeman, with Lupin&#039;s sudden marriage to Rebecca Rossellini, a beautiful but bratty heiress &amp; socialite in San Marino. Of course, the wedding is not what it seems, but the episode is a great (re)introduction to Lupin III, with a fun jewel heist &amp; culminating with detective Zenigata pursuing Lupin over rooftops with all the kinetic, gravity defying energy one could hope for.<br />
<br />
It also begins the main story of the series, as Lupin et al find themselves caught up in the mystery surrounding the “Dream of Italy.” The new characters introduced for this series, Rebecca &amp; MI:6 agent Nix, seem fine additions alongside Lupin III&#039;s regular characters. Nix is certainly the weaker character, underutilised as well as seemingly being gifted with new, unexplained powers whenever the plot needs it. Rebecca is clearly the newcomer that the writers were most interested in. A spoilt brat who manages not to be as annoying as that character type often is, she soon reveals herself to be a thrill seeker for whom Lupin represents the ultimate prize. For a man who loves all women too much to be tied to just one, that represents a challenge. Their relationship seems to have been seized on as a chance to explore a dynamic that couldn&#039;t be done between Lupin &amp; his old flame Fujiko.<br />
<br />
As to the “Dream of Italy” itself, in truth it&#039;s a bit of a mess. The idea behind it seems to be to take Lupin&#039;s quote comparing great thieves to great artists &amp; have him face off against the world&#039;s greatest artist in a battle of wits. It certainly has some creative ideas, with a couple of surreal dream episodes, &amp; Lupin &amp; Rebecca make for a fun duo. But by the time Lupin et al are trying to save the world from the clone of a certain historical figure made by MI:6 after they stole the dream research of oh no I&#039;ve gone cross-eyed.<br />
<br />
Luckily, the “Dream of Italy” is easier to watch than to understand the point of &amp; anyway only makes up about half of the episodes of the series. The rest are standalone stories that either focus in more detail on a couple of the characters, or heists that wouldn&#039;t fit the tone of the main story. These are arguably the best part of the series, particularly those that focus on or have cameos by older characters. Old Lupin III fans may get the most out of them, but new viewers should enjoy the chance to get to know the characters better &amp; see them in more varied situations. All of the main VA&#039;s have voiced their characters previously, so none sound uncomfortable or unsuited to their roles, though for various reasons Kiyoshi Kobayashi (Jigen) is the only one to have been in the last TV series.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a little disappointing that the production of this latest series is as uneven as it is. The character designs are nice, though none of the new characters have quite the immediate recognisability of Monkey Punch&#039;s original creations. Still, at least they mostly kept the look of the older art style. That might seem like something obvious, but after the horrible mix of bishoenen &amp; beak nosed men in the recent Young Black Jack anime, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if someone on the production committee suggested “modernising” the look of Lupin. The background art is the stand out part of the production, with outdoor scenes in particular looking gorgeous.<br />
<br />
The animation quality, though, is mixed. The first episode is great &amp; there are plenty of sequences peppered throughout that look good &amp; are fun to watch. Of particular note is that, while CGI cars are present, the many chases between Lupin &amp; Zenigata all look hand drawn, &amp; much better for it. But on the other hand, especially in the mid-season, quality takes a notable downgrade, though it picks up for the final few episodes. The first episode is, perhaps unfortunately, also the one that best combines Lupin III&#039;s characters, setting &amp; style into one package.<br />
<br />
Like the art, it&#039;s also nice that they kept the music in the style of the old series&#039;. Indeed unlike, for example, the frankly unpleasant version of the Cutie Honey theme song in 2004&#039;s Re: Cutie Honey, this series take on the Lupin III theme song stands up well. The OST also has a jazzy vibe that reminds one of classic heist &amp; crime films. For the end credits, rather than just shoving in any old pop song that&#039;s looking for a chart boost, or have one of the female VA&#039;s do a character song, they went for a sultry jazz number by long time enka singer Sayuri Ishihawa. It all adds up to make each episode that bit more fun to watch.<br />
<br />
Sadly, it seems that despite the name recognition, the forth series of Lupin III has been mostly passed over by anime fans. While I can&#039;t speak for existing Lupin fans, who may well not find anything that they haven&#039;t got from Lupin&#039;s many previous appearances, as a newcomer this newest series seemed as easily accessible &amp; enjoyable entry point as one could hope for. Just as the series began with Lupin&#039;s gang coming together, the final episode ends with them fading off screen, one at a time, as they once again part ways till their next heist. I&#039;ll be looking forward to it.

    To open up, this is very different from any other Lupin thing you&#039;ll see. I mean that in more bad ways, than good.<br />
<br />
They turned Lupin into a know it all that never messes up and can save everyone. There&#039;s an unneeded love story with the overblown side character, that doesn&#039;t even get that much explained development. She gets some development but there&#039;s too much of her that&#039;s let in absurdity at the end for it to make sense. She didn&#039;t really get any better but it&#039;s like she acted like some of the stuff was ok.<br />
<br />
Lupin out-shined the other characters, for the most part. Everything

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244146">
        about what he was doing got more detail than what the other characters where doing. Jigen and Goemon got there own spots. Jigen&#039;s was cool, relevant, what you would expect from Jigen. Goemon&#039;s was about a girl, and it was weird but ok. You know Goemon falling in love with every women he meets.<br />
<br />
Fujiko is the unfortunate case where her spot couldn&#039;t be about how cool and skilled she is. It was about how reckless and haphazard she is. She&#039;s cool sometimes, but most of the time she only gets away with stuff because she didn&#039;t die. It was about Lupin, and how &quot;in-love&quot; they are, even though Fujiko and Lupin&#039;s relationship isn&#039;t even like that outside of words. We&#039;ve been looking at these people for a love enough time to know they aren&#039;t in love with each other, but they really tried to force that non-existence bond down our throats in this one. They clearly have bond, but it&#039;s not that and it shouldn&#039;t have to be.<br />
<br />
Can&#039;t forget those homophobic undertones in a few spots. No one has more homophobic undertones surrounding them than post 80s Fujiko. They still do that &quot;bond between men and women&quot; stuff, which is not only homophobic but can also be considered transphobic. There&#039;s also no gay/ trans characters. What&#039;s the point of redoing a series to be modern when your storytelling and character designing to still stuck in the heterocentric 70s? <br />
<br />
And, I got sick of Italy. In a series, I expect the group to travel, get into all kinds of messes, and all that jolly goodness I&#039;ve had up until now. This story had narrow plots for very un-narrow characters. With Lupin outshining everyone it wasn&#039;t about the team being together, either. I didn&#039;t get anything I usually watch Lupin for. I like Lupin goofying up and being in danger. I like it when the others have to save Lupin.  I love it when the other characters shine and show off! I love it when character development women ACTUALLY gets character development! I love random travel and adventures! This was a huge disappointment for me!<br />
<br />
The only character that didn&#039;t disappoint me was Zenigata! He actually surprised me a lot! He hasn&#039;t changed at all and I love that they didn&#039;t ruin him! I enjoyed going into Zeni&#039;s feelings about Lupin and getting to know him as a great cook!<br />
<br />
This series also had villains and ended on a central villain that was weird. <br />
The central villain in a Lupin series was some boring, lazy storytelling. They tried really hard to make it good, but it only took Lupin the defeat it, with no help from the others, which was also boring.<br />
<br />
At the end, I wouldn&#039;t suggest this to anyone. Not just for the homophobic undertones, but lackluster character usage and boring storytelling, with characters that are suppose to be WAY MORE exciting and fast paced.

    Lupin III, the cops-and-robbers saga that began in the late 1960s, has gone through several iterations in its long history. This new series is the most contemporary one to date, with the ambition of using past iterations of the saga (notably combining anti-heroic and chivalrous Lupin) in a new format to provide a blend of new thrills and old favourites. <br />
<br />
<br />
The show is fully set in the land of Italy, which has a unique culture (from the seedy Mafioso to the glorious Renaissance) that makes it a great setting for the Lupin cast to caper about. The show also presents two new characters: the thrill-seeking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review234884">
        billionaire Rebecca Rosselini who marries Lupin for the challenge she presents to him, and the secret agent Nyx who frequently crosses paths with Lupin while he goes about his work. Both characters are well-developed and present a refreshing foil to Lupin’s rivals Fujiko and Zenigata, making things more unexpected and exciting. There is also one character that sets in motion a grand plan involving all of Italy... <br />
<br />
However, the show is still vintage Lupin, and there are a fair amount of episodes that are dedicated to individual adventures starring Lupin or his acquaintances. These episodes do not take away from the main plot and are pretty enjoyable, presenting a wide variety of escapades from an assassination plan to a pet dog running off.  These stories do justice to the Lupin cast in the modern era; they were always slightly anachronistic due to their 60s-70s origin, and these stories enable them to adequately manage contemporary times with their unique attitude and style. Speaking for myself I find these stories to be the best part of the show, Lupin is best enjoyed in such tales. And special mention must be made to bringing back Lupin composer Yuji Ohno, who not only revives the iconic Lupin theme song but adds some beautiful atmospheric Italian tunes to the show. <br />
<br />
<br />
The show has its problems, though. The aforementioned secret character and his plan are basically inspired by the mastermind of the 1977 film, which can reduce the appeal for those who know the Lupin history. As I said above, Lupin is best enjoyed in small-scale episodic adventures.   <br />
<br />
I also find the artwork to be slightly extravagant; the artwork is definitely beautiful, but the character design tries too hard to replicate the special work of Lupin artist Hayao Miyazaki. Lupin’s artwork is primarily sketchy and cartoonish, which helps to enhance the fun and noir-esque element of Lupin. To be fair, the previous Lupin show THE WOMAN CALLED FUJIKO MINE had beautiful artwork that set a difficult standard to match; this show just barely manages to be as good.  <br />
<br />
And on a personal level, I dislike how serious Zenigata was in the show; it was a matter of improving him from a comical but tenacious inspector into a policeman who could be taken seriously, but I do miss the comical antics Lupin and Zenigata carried on with each other. <br />
<br />
<br />
In the end, the show proves to be a successful modernizing of Lupin, and a worthy watch for both old and new fans of the unstoppable thief. <br />

    This anime is a great start for people wanting to get into the Lupin franchise. Lupin the third is a big franchise that has had many iterations since the 1970s. Since I recently finished the lupin franchise I will say I started with the newest or latest lupin being this one. The story is fun and unique. It is about lupin and his gang who steal priceless jewels, treasure, and artifacts. All while avoiding capture by the police. Lupin makes up interesting plans on how to steal specific targets. I watched the english dub for this one.The episodes each have their own unique charm. Some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273836">
        episodes they help out movie stars, soccer players, a teacher and other things too.  The soundtrack for the dub was the same music used for the Italian dub. The english dub music is so smooth, chill, relaxing, and fits the atmosphere more so than the Japanese soundtrack for lupin part 4. Lupin part 4 explores new characters and a new love interest that added great dialogue and character development for a reboot of lupin. Lupin brushes with the British MI6.The action is amazing and smooth. The comedy is very good and adds to the characters. The art is enchanting and makes you get absorbed into the art that it gets mesmerizing. Each episode is different and explores different instances. It has a continuous plot that continues throughout the series through some episodes. Many episodes will make you relate in some way with some of the characters. The villains are well thought of and are a breath of fresh air.Not all of the episodes involve Lupin stealing. Some episodes Lupin is the hero or sometimes we get to see what the characters are doing when not doing their job or profession. It is a breath of fresh and will not feel tiresome since you get to explore the characters lives and the beautiful country of Italy.  Try this anime out if you like comedy, action, great jazzy cool music, beautiful art, interesting characters, like episodes that involve many themes, and love shipping.It will leave you wanting more and want to explore different instances and side quests apart from the main story. If you like exploration of different moments like helping a soccer player, interacting with a movie star then you will like this.

    This rendition of Lupin III is the quintessential version of Lupin;  its fresh faced, awe inspiring and nostalgic at the same damn time. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a perfect version of everything that has come before it, and it&#039;s a perfect way for the newcomer to get into the world of Lupin and Co. <br />
<br />
At the risk of committing high-treason, I&#039;d say that this is the best Lupin III EVER. Not since &quot;The Count of Cagliostro&quot; has Lupin looked, sounded, and flowed so masterfully. <br />
<br />
The choice of soundtrack here is as perfect as Cowboy Bebop;  it&#039;s epic, sly and sexy, and totally purposeful, and never ventures

          <span style="display: none;" id="review253266">
        into the area of vapid, horrible j-pop or pop-cultural diarrhea like most modern anime. The intro alone is absolutely hype in the best way possible.  <br />
<br />
The artwork is both vintage and modern, keeping its hand-drawn appeal while the slick, smooth CGI never rears its ugly head long enough to be noticed. It&#039;s direction is that of a sleek heist film- think &quot;Oceans 11&quot;- mixed with hilarity of &quot;The blues brothers.&quot; If you noticed that both my references were western, its because Lupin has a distinctly western vibe and attitude, as it always has. <br />
<br />
The story line is episodic enough to where you can jump in at almost any point and still enjoy the adventure, but has enough continuity to keep you wanting to watch the gang get into trouble all throughout the beautifully rendered Italian hillsides, cities, and towns. <br />
<br />
In total, its a series of sheer brilliance and style, and a total love letter to the franchise as a whole. It&#039;s a unique gem amidst an ocean of cliche and pointless anime, and it should be held on a pedestal for all the world to see, and say, &quot;Yes, I watch Anime, and yes, it is a high art.&quot;

    Lupin III never leaves me feeling unsatisfied. The absolute pandemonium Lupin’s arrangement of characters leave in the wake of their adventures is very enjoyable. It is, I believe, Lupin III (2015)’s lovable cast of characters (new and old) that really brings the show to life, imbuing each episode with such a fun and jazzy atmosphere throughout.<br />
<br />
It is because of the chemistry Lupin has with all the characters that gives the show its flare but Lupin is an old franchise, these relationships have been well trodden. This is why the involvement of the new character Rebecca Rossellini and the other additional cast is such a breath

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249122">
        of fresh air. Rebecca is introduced as Lupin’s fiancé, a bubbly, confidant and successful fashion icon/business woman/actress (she’s a busy woman). Rebecca though, is a thrill seeker and has her own secrets, leading her to being a rival of Lupin and the rest of the group.  It is also through Rebecca that we are introduced to the overarching plot of Lupin 2015. <br />
<br />
Most of the show takes place in episodic stories, wherein we follow the cast though a short one episode adventure. These stories are commonly used to strengthen the new characters like Rebecca or Nyx, showing us their backstories and motivations help us invest in their relation to the plot. Despite Nyx’s hard exterior (always seemingly calm and collected) once someone he cares about is placed in harm’s way, it becomes evident how vulnerable he can be – even if that’s through him going completely off the rails. The same goes for Rebecca, who on first glance seems like a privileged, immature young girl, doing what she wants just because she can we later learn that she has experienced a lot more than her genki appearance would present. These aren’t the most complex of characterizations but they do a great deal in helping get to understand and love these personalities.<br />
<br />
Other episodes may be focused on Lupin III (2015)’s overarching plot and whilst the further we get into the story the harder it is to sustain your suspension of disbelief, it thankfully never tries to sell you on its logic. This is part of the fun though, because the show never pretends to be realistic – with bullets that never hit targets and the cast getting out of the direst situations – it’s difficult to approach it with these expectations. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there are some episodes that neither have good character development, interesting concept for a story or a strong resolution to the conflict. Episode 2 (The Fake Fantasista) lacks the focus on the developing the lovable characters and instead introduces a character who will never return and isn’t related to the plot. It’s relatively uneventful, forgettable and by the end of its run nothing feels lost or gained. Well, aside from 20 minutes of my life. This is why I believe that the show is at its strongest when it concentrates on its main cast, when they are deeply involved in the episodes narrative.  <br />
<br />
Lupin is great for the lead role of these characters, having great chemistry with the rest of the cast. Since Lupin is the audacious type, always running into danger and chasing women with reckless abandon, his partner in crime, Jigen completely contrasts this. He is aloof and lightly spoken, giving him a calculated demeanour which makes him a great companion for Lupin – that and the fact he’s the best gunman in the universe. Whenever he lets his guard down Jigen has his back.<br />
<br />
The seductress thief Fujiko Mine plays to all Lupin’s weaknesses. Using her irresistible personality and body to achieve her goals, Lupin can’t stop himself from bending over backwards to score with her. Since Fujiko has a habit of betraying them whenever it suits her interests she has an almost bitter relationship with Jigen. With Fujiko being the ultimate femme fatale it’s lucky that Lupin is sharper than he lets on. Otherwise both he and Jigen probably would have died long ago.<br />
<br />
The series looks amazing. The background illustrations are vibrant and highly detailed, painting a beautiful and rural Italy. They were all probably based off real locations within the country, which would seemingly be the case with how authentic the setting looks (that and the guy credited as Director of Photography). The characters are brought to life with their designs, the women looking particularly attractive with both Fujiko and Rebecca sporting multi-tonal hair colour. With the women constantly changing outfits and the men looking as smart as ever, the casts fashion sense is a treat to behold. Since the designs are so complicated the animation isn’t as fluid as it could be and it also can look a bit rough sometimes but the general appearance of the show is great so it makes up for it.<br />
<br />
 The episode ‘From Japan with Love’ is where I believe the shows art direction peaks, being the only one set in Japan it gets the privilege of being the most unique looking episode in the show (well, aside from the obvious). It sports a completely different colour pallet using autumn colours to give it a warm atmosphere as opposed to the summer feeling the rest of the show has. Setting it in Japan lets us to see the series from a fresh perspective - with architecture and fashion representative of its country – allowing the artists to explore different styles and concepts. We also get to see Fujiko let her hair down as she relaxes in her home country. Her design is altered giving her black hair and a more natural aesthetic which just makes her more irresistible. <br />
<br />
Lupin III (2015) is good. Even given its occasionally lacklustre writing, the shows personality, its characters and visual presentation are all usually more than enough to carry my enjoyment through to the end of an episode. Those positives don’t erase the negatives as a whole but with Lupin being as enjoyable as it is, it leaves me to question whether this matters all that much in the end. <br />

    I&#039;m italian and I&#039;m a lifelong fan of Lupin. It was broadcasted in early afternoon, right after lunch, when I was a kid, and I used to watch it after I came home from school. Like many italian kids of my generation, I grew up with Dragon Ball, the Simpsons and Lupin III. <br />
So when Amazon Prime put this on, I was glad I could finally see it. And I had great fun, sure, but I have also some issue.<br />
<br />
The italian adventure of Lupin III and his friends starts with a new entry in the team, a girl named Rebecca that marries (sort of) the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review413183">
        king of thieves and wants to become one herself. But it won&#039;t be so easy, and they will also end up in a series of conspiracies involving MI6, italian history and all sorts of treasures to plunder.<br />
<br />
The arts are gorgeous.<br />
A thing that never failed to amaze me was the incredible attention to details that the artists of the series had for every single panel. Not only that, but also the colors and the animations were incredible. It was also beautiful to see a lot of hand-drawn animation and not the overaboundance of CGI that we commonly see nowadays. I have nothing against the use of CGI, mind you, it&#039;s just that I prefer traditional animations. I find them more &quot;authentic&quot;, if you get me.<br />
<br />
Despite having a plot, the season is mostly made of standalone episodes, with many focusing on single characters of the team. However, I have to say that even these are mostly Lupin-centric, with Goemon, Jigen and Fujiko having not a lot time to shine. Despite this, some episodes are really well made, like the one about the haunted castle. Zenigata is still the best character, having even an episode that is pure bromance.<br />
The main villain, whose identity I will not write here, is however one the main flaws of the series. Because he is, well, an historical character who is well known for having done pretty good things in his life, and here he becomes some kind of a super-fascist. Something that made me feel uneasy.<br />
<br />
The other thing that I really disliked is the way they used Italy. Aside from showing Rome, Milan and some other monument, most of the series doesn&#039;t really use Italy well. Why Lupin never tried, for example, to steal something from the world famous Uffizi Museum in Florence? Why cities like Turin or Naples (aside from a copycat Napoli Football Club appearing) are never mentioned, no less the place of a heist? San Marino is used much better, with the architecture of the city and its monuments being a main point for the plot of the entire series. There are even two episodes that are set in France and Japan, probably because they had no more ideas about how to set episodes in the Beautiful Country.<br />
<br />
But aside from that, I can&#039;t say I didn&#039;t have fun. Aside from an episode or two (especially the one with the zombies in Venice), most of the series was incredibly satisfying to watch. So, it&#039;s definitely recommended.
