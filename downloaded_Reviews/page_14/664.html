    This is the first time I&#039;ve ever felt about reviewing a particular show on MAL. Perhaps, my love for this show is significantly greater than any show in existence? What I’m about to state in this review is relatively the truth... <br />
<br />
Alright, so what&#039;s Overlord III about? What has Ainz-sama achieved so far till this season? What were the main events that took place before this season? Has the premise of the series changed?<br />
<br />
THIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN MILD SPOILERS.<br />
<br />
So, previously in the first season we see Momonga somehow &quot;mysteriously&quot; getting teleported to a new world or getting trapped into a game called Dive Massively Multiplayer

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290697">
        Online Role Playing Game, also known as DMMO-RPG Yggdrasil (while Yggdrasil being the new release of the game), on which he spent his whole life at, and finally created the guild weapon, the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown, a symbol of the guild namely Ainz Ooal Gown. Now when the game’s about to see its end, we see the guild members leaving the guild, and hoping to spend their lives much better since they had spent most of their life on this game, which they realized was worth nothing. Momonga, being the guild master, was quite furious over the shutdown of the game and blamed his guild members for not spending their last moment with the game. And calling them traitors, when they actually had spent their whole time on the game and without their efforts, the Overlord, Ainz-sama would’ve never achieved such strength and power. Or shall I say such arrogance and ignorance? Now being teleported to a new world, and being shocked at how this event took place. Momonga summons his guardians and orders Sebas, the butler, to investigate the surrounding of the great tomb of Nazarick. And see if they had really been teleported to a mysterious place/world, while ordering the floor guardians to stay on guard. Then we see Momonga-sama taking a tour of the first floor in his great tomb and being discovered by Demiurge. We see Demiurge outsmarting Momonga-sama. Which outrightly surprises Momonga-sama. But being the great overlord, it also meant him being “all-knowing” and he just couldn’t let any of his harem members realize that. Now, while being accompanied by Demiurge, Momonga-sama utters, “...taking over the world might be enjoyable.” Which he obviously didn’t mean it at all, but Demiurge was really surprised and felt outclassed by such thoughts of Momonga-sama. Thus being a side premise of this season. <br />
<br />
Continuing on, we see Momonga-sama using the Mirror of Remote Viewing magic item. Where he notices a village being attacked by the knights. To which Momonga-sama rushes to their aid, of course, not with the “true” intentions of saving them. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to call himself an evil overlord in front of his harem. Now Momonga-sama outclasses every knight, and chases them away and meets the Royal Head Warrior, Gazef Stronoff. Now the Slane Theocracy strikes back with a trump card at their hands, a 7th tier magic item. Which again is outclassed by the great Momonga-sama. After the visit to the Carne Village, Momonga-sama decides to change his name to Ainz-sama i.e. the guild name. To which the sole purpose was to spread this name, the name of the guild, and see if he meets anyone else in the new world. His objective was to explore this world and see if there were other players from Yggdrasil, and trying to figure out how he could return back to his own world. Which was the main premise of the season.<br />
<br />
Now Ainz-sama orders Sebas Tian and Solution to explore more about this world. And orders Shaltear to accompany him. While him visiting the E-Rantel Fortress City accompanied by Narberal Gamma, one of the maid pleiades, as wanting to be adventurers. To spread the name of Momon, the great adventurer, and again to gain knowledge about the new world. The potion given to one of the adventurers by Momon is taken to the best pharmacist. To which to her surprise is the potion that has the healing abilities of a God. Thus, leading to the meeting of Nphirea with the great Momon-san and Ainz-sama. Momon-san joins a guild for new adventures, since those adventures were of no match to him. Also, so that they could be witnesses to the power of Momon-san, the future’s greatest adventurer. But now, even Ainz-sama or Momon-san isn’t perfect, Clementine, a member of the Slane Theocracy, ruins the plan of the great Momon-san by killing all of the adventurers. To which Ainz-sama responds to by crushing her to death, and killing the rest of her comrades. Meanwhile, we see Shaltear, Sebas and Solution on their mission. And at the middle of their travel, a group of mercenaries halt the carriage and attempt to take them to their place. But they are massacred by them, and later they find out the nest of the humans that attacked them. Now Solution and Sebas part ways from Shaltear. And Shaltear heads towards the nest of the humans to test out the skills of Brain Unglaus, a man who knew martial arts and had fought Gazef on equal terms. To her surprise, is disappointed by the the abilities of Brain as he even fails to pass as a nail clipper. Now Shaltear absorbs all the blood, she had gathered by killing the humans and goes berserk. Massacring even the adventurers who arrived to explore the base of the soldiers turned mercenaries. Until she recovers by seeing the red potion, the potion which Ainz-sama had given to an adventurer. And discovers that the adventurers were actually split in two teams, and the second team was already headed to E-Rantel. Knowing that, she immediately chases them in her blood-frenzy mode. At the end someone amongst that group casted a mind-control spell on her, causing her to revolt against Ainz-sama. Accepting the quest as Momon, Ainz-sama heads towards Shaltear for battle. During this battle we see how great Ainz-sama is, completely surpassing Shaltear. And later revives her and plans to use Sebas and Solution as decoys. Sasuga Ainz-sama was secondarily the premise of the series.<br />
<br />
Now outraged by the brainwashing of the only loli in his harem, Ainz-sama immediately launches an attack on the lizardmen. And completely overwhelms them and kills the leaders of the tribe. And makes them accept him as their ruler. This arc was of no importance to the series. The whole event took four episodes of the season. Afterwards, we see the second season focusing on Sebas and on the kingdom. Which again was of no significance. Overlord sure knows how to waste its time on insignificant bullshit. The rest of the season focuses on the Eight fingers. Who are captured by Ainz-sama and are experimented on by his harem. While capturing them, Entoma, one of the insects in the harem, suffers a serious damage by the adamantite adventurers. Who’s later saved by Jaldabaoth, the Demon Emperor. At the end, we see Momon emerges as the greatest adventurer of the world. Since he defeats the great Jaldabaoth. And adds another member to his harem i.e. Evil Eye. Perhaps, the only two lolis in his harem? In this season “Sasuga Ainz-sama” had become more or less a primary premise of the series. The second season itself had so many plot holes, but since the review is about the third season, I’ll only mention the least concerning one in my eyes. That is, no one ever questioned Momon-san about how was he able to beat Jaldabaoth, a magic caster whose power level was of 66+ according to Evil Eye, without casting away his humanity? There’s no way a human could beat such monster. Yet no one bothered asking him anything. And if they had Ainz would’ve had to reveal his identity. Of course, they wouldn’t either, since the whole show is just “Sasuga Ainz-sama” or “Sasuga Momon-sama.” Ainz sure knows how to get praised in every single form. <br />
<br />
Story: 1<br />
<br />
This season begins with a filler episode; the only episode which was actually worth watching in the whole season. In the episode, it’s revealed how massive the harem of Ainz-sama is; completely unparalleled, incomparable to any harem anime in existence. After the first episode, the story begins its focus on the objective of Nazarick. And thus, the words that Ainz-sama had uttered in the first season. Now Ainz-sama trying to outsmart his harem clearly fails, and then tries to play along their plans, otherwise he wouldn’t be an evil overlord. In simple words, being controlled by them since he’s supposed to be “all-knowing” and great, otherwise, you know, he really wouldn’t be the Sasuga. And the whole premise is “Sasuga Ainz-sama.” The show either forgets its main aim or just casts it away since “Sasuga Ainz-sama” is a very important premise. <br />
<br />
In this season, we see Ainz desperately trying to prove he’s the only Sasuga in the world. He tries to stoop to the lowest level just to prove he’s the Sasuga, instead of acting like all-knowing or all-whatever. This season shows that the whole plot of Overlord isn’t as complex as it was meant or shown to be in the first season. From watching this show, it has become clearly evident that it’s just Ainz-sama and his harem squashing ants. And the series gives off the vibes as if even an amatuer could come up with such a mediocre setting. <br />
<br />
Since the first season we’ve been seeing Ainz desperately trying to appeal and please his harem. And now, he even goes further by killing and torturing innocent people and accusing them of being evil. Ainz still thinks about his image, despite getting such loyalty and devotion. They wouldn’t dare say “Ainz-sama are you really an evil overlord”? He’s already a god for them. At this point he shouldn’t care about what his harem thinks and just give them orders, yet he doesn’t dare so. Ainz, despite being an evil overlord, still worries about meaningless things.<br />
<br />
Continuing on, this series has no plot. We’re constantly introduced to new characters, we get entire episodes of how their lives are, their aim, who they love, etc. What has happened to this series? Why should I care about the ants which will indefinitely get squashed? Ainz will without a doubt rule the world, their fates are sealed from the very beginning. Everyone will either submit to his will or get killed/tortured by him and his harem. This show keeps on introducing more and more insignificant characters who are killed miserably usually with one hit from even the least powerful members of the great tomb of Nazarick. This is a waste of time, yet the show still gets dragged on pointlessly. Ainz can easily conquer the whole world without even using a fraction of his power, yet he and his harem play from the shadows. Plus, the whole series is very slow-paced.<br />
<br />
Characters: 1<br />
<br />
This show has a very terrible character development. For example take the four episodes in the second season, where we were introduced to lizardmen, their lifestyles, who they love, what they wish, etc. and then they get killed and become test subjects. The third season also does the same, this season has been nothing but a waste of time. Where time is spent on developing minor characters who have no future and will contribute nothing to the plot since no matter what Ainz will have his way and they’ll either get killed, experimented, or becomes slaves; just like lizardmen contributed nothing and their struggle i.e. the drama was pointless and useless. <br />
<br />
Animation: 2<br />
<br />
The 3D animation looks very cheap and is of extremely low quality. For a third season, this is completely unforgivable. And as for the rest, it’s nothing special. The overall quality has dropped immensely. And almost every character looks the same.<br />
<br />
Sound: 2<br />
<br />
The voices of the characters in the series was quite satisfactory. This series has been re-using the osts of the first season. It hasn’t even introduced any of the new osts; neither this season nor the previous one. It keeps on playing the same osts which were played in the first season. A very very low effort indeed. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1<br />
<br />
From the second season, this show had gone down abruptly. And this season is nothing but a disaster with a lot of useless development and unnecessary crap. But I do get the appeal of this show and why many would enjoy it. For example for the harem members. This show has quite a variety of members like vampire loli, a wolf, an insect, a lizard, etc. and there are many other reasons too...<br />
<br />
Overall: 1<br />
<br />

    You know what? Sometimes it is fun to route for the bad guy. Sometimes you are drawn to the villains of a story by their overwhelming power, how cunning and intelligent they are, or their unquestionable charisma. A good villain always leaves a mark during and after the story is finished. So what happens when you take those villains and make them the protagonist of their own stories? Well you get shows like Overlord. A series that has had three seasons now when we thought it was a one and done series. But nope, Madhouse has stuck to this series with another season. And now

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290704">
        Overlord, in my opinion, is taking its stride. <br />
<br />
Why do I say that? Well I&#039;m about to tell you. Sit back, relax and make sure you demand SILENCE! while you are reading this review as I present to you the anime review for Overlord, Season 3. Let begin shall we. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 8.5/10<br />
<br />
So Ains Ooal Gown (or Momonga, or Momon or Papa Bone Daddy, whatever you want to call him) has now established Nazerick in the world they they still have no idea how they got there. Now that he has established Nazerick, his next course of action is to take over the world as is power and presence must be known across all of the kingdoms and countries. Or at least that what Demiurge believes and Ains is just rolling with it. In order to maintain control of Nazerick and his subjects, he must essentially go along with it although he never planned it in the first place and confront the nearby kingdoms in order to rule the world. <br />
<br />
Once again the show is separated into two story arcs where each arc follows different characters and how they are tied to Ains&#039; plans and objectives. The first arc follows the village that Ains saved back in season one and how they are progressing. The second arc follows the actions of the Empire, a faction that was teased at the end of season two, and how they are tied to Ains progression of ruling the world. Now world building is once again, focused in Overlord and it is one of its biggest strengths. It doesn&#039;t just focus on the inhabitants of Nazerick but the people outside it. It helps give depth to this world and its characters. You get invested into these characters to the point where once they interact with Ains Ooal Gown, you hope that they make it out okay. <br />
<br />
Speaking of which, the polarity of who to route for in this show has taken full swing in this show. While season two also did this, season three is where I think it now has more weight. As the escalation grows in this show, you hope that some of the world&#039;s core characters make it out unscathed, especially when they confront Ains or his subordinates. You want to route for Ains because he his the main protagonist and the character we get invested into the most, but you still want to route for the &quot;good guys&quot; because they are developed enough to get invested into them. Sometimes that is the case. Sometimes it is not. This just shows you how defined the world is and how putting investment into it helps flesh it out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 8.5/10<br />
<br />
This season really does give us more insight into the mind of Ains Ooal Gown as it shows that he is just going along with the ride. Like I said earlier, Demiurge believes that Ains is now planning to take over the world whereas Ains didn&#039;t think on doing that. Now that the other floor guardians believe that, he essentially must do what they believe he will do in order to maintain control of Nazerick. He is portrayed as always being 3 or 4 steps ahead but in reality, he is just making it up as he goes along. He also has to practice his lines and poses in his spare time in order to maintain his image. It&#039;s a nice reminder that he isn&#039;t some all knowing, all seeing Overlord, but rather a simple, human businessman who was invested into an MMORPG pretending to be an evil Overlord. <br />
<br />
Of course that doesn&#039;t mean he doesn&#039;t do it well because when he requires to do some evil deeds, he will do them without remorse. This season just reminds you that Ains is indeed a straight up villain. The previous two seasons sort of portrays Ains as both being good and bad. While he did some evil things, he also did some good things as well (Mainly when he is under the disguise of Momon). BUT NOPE. This series pretty much gives you a solid reminder that Ains is indeed the main evil that puts all other evils to shame. This season is by far the darkest season we&#039;ve had because the actions that Ains took in this series are just pure villainy. Word of advice, if you ever threaten Nazerick, dig a grave. Then immediately fill up that grave because your body isn&#039;t coming back. Then stick a bunch of red flags into your head as you skip ever so gracefully into Nazerick to never be seen again as you will be remembered as the idiot who went into Nazerick looking like a t**t. <br />
<br />
As for the characters that were focused on in the arcs, we have two to talk about. First there is Enri Emmot, a member of the village that Ains saved personally and Jircniv Rune Farlord El Nix (we will just call him Jircniv), the ruler of the aforementioned Empire who is always at war with the kingdom from the second season. <br />
<br />
So Enri is the main vessel from where we see how the village has progressed since season one. She is somewhat the figurehead of the village as she also the leader of a platoon of goblins that were summoned to protect the village. We see her over the course of the season take more responsibility as she it put into situations where she requires a level head and figure out the best course of action. She is essentially the kind and courageous person you would see take charge as the lead character, unaware that she is serving Papa Bone Daddy who is completely evil. But the problem I find with her is that I don&#039;t see nothing more than just a vessel used to show the progression of the village in the show&#039;s world building. I don&#039;t get invested into her as much than say Zaryusu Sasha from season two because his motives were defined enough for me to get invested into him. For Enri, everything develops around her, rather than she is the main person involved. However, there is good use of foreshadowing where she will have to take center stage and have situations that involve around her in the future. <br />
<br />
As for Jircniv, he is a good case of how looks can be deceiving. First impressions might describe him as a pompous a***ole who doesn&#039;t give a s**t. But actually, he is not that. He is cunning as he needs to think what is best for his Empire and plans out what the best course of action is that will benefit him and his Empire and to make sure it does not crumble, mainly when confronting Nazerick and Ains Ooal Gown. While he gets less screen-time than Enri. He is the kind of character that you can get invested in because you know definitely, he is going to play a big part in the future. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s not to say other characters in this show do not get defined enough. From the workers who raid Nazerick to the goblins who protect the village to more established characters like Gazef Stronoff and Nfirea Bareare. Each character is defined enough to get invested into and to look forward to see what happens next for them. Not all of them are hits but the majority of the cast is enjoyable to watch. <br />
<br />
<br />
Animation: 5/10 <br />
<br />
I think that I should come to expect that the animation quality isn&#039;t going to change for the better. So the animation will always be stuck on good but not great. However, I have also noticed that this season has increased the use of CGI animation and yeah, it does not look good. It just lacks detail and polish as it loses some of the impact of some scenes in the anime. Anyone that has watched episode 12 will pretty much agree with that statement. Trust me, you will notice it when the quality of the CGI animation gets bad. What I don&#039;t get is that it uses both CGI and hand drawn animation on the same models and likes to switch between them. Why Madhouse won&#039;t stick to one type is beyond me. Probably for budget reasons but that just feels like a sorry excuse of not allocating resources properly. While it does make sense for some character models like the Death Knights since they are larger than the average human, it just looks bad for other character models like the goblin and human soldiers. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
Once again, the same soundtrack returns to Overlord III with haunting instrumentals and bombastic choir vocals. It is the soundtrack that can only be associated with a bad-ass, freaking Overlord. But my problem is a lack of notable new soundtracks (if there were any). The ones that I remember are the ones that we are already established with, which is quite a shame. It is not bad as the OST overall is still good but lets get some new stuff in here shall we? Before we start looping in circles. <br />
<br />
The opening is something different and yet familiar at the same time. This time, MYTH&amp;ROID swap with OxT to do the opening and my word, did MYTH&amp;ROID and Tom-H@ck do a good job on the opening. The opening, &quot;Voracity,&quot; is much better choreographed than the previous two openings and is the most visually impressive out the three openings. The instrumentals as well are much better with them sounding much more heavy than the previous two but still sounding like an Overlord opening. This is also backed up with the lyrics being catchy as hell and able to stop and start without it feeling tedious. This all culminates to being the best Overlord opening out of the 3 IMO and one I have listened to countless times. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve never appreciated Overlord&#039;s ending sequences till now because this one was an enjoyable ending sequence. OxT did the ending sequence this time with a more slower piece of work than their openings but still using heavy, electrical instruments to match the instrumentals with the opening. But what really stole the show were the illustrations used in the ending as they looked gorgeous; somewhat reminiscing the art style of the Light Novel&#039;s. I&#039;ll have to make sure not to skip these from now on if they keep up this quality. <br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion: <br />
<br />
So what did I mean when I said Overlord is taking its stride? Well what I meant by that was where we are in the story and how established its world and characters are, Overlord is now going full steam ahead with its trajectory and it doesn&#039;t look like its planning to stop until it reaches its destination. While its animation quality has taken a dip and the OST is now starting to go in a loop. Its heart and soul will always be its world and characters because that is what it does best. We always look into the world and its inhabitants and get attached to them before Ains and co. swoop in and probably take over their lives. It is kind of funny how this show has gone from finding out where they are and if there are other players there as well to watching a powerful Overlord start to take over the world. <br />
<br />
If you were not a fan on how Overlord II was structured and how the attention was always driven away from Ains, then this season won&#039;t change your mind as it is pretty much more of the same. If you were a fan like I was, then you should be happy. I would imagine Madhouse would want to see this anime through since it is popular enough to have three seasons already. And you know what Madhouse? I will still continue to watch Overlord and bow down to THE GREAT SORCERER KING, AINS OOAL GOWN!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My Personal Enjoyment: 9.5/10<br />
<br />
Overall score: 7.9/10 Recommendation: Watch it (If you haven&#039;t already.)

    There are four major aspects of Overlord that make it appealing.  <br />
<br />
1)	Protagonists are villains.<br />
2)	Protagonists are ridiculously overpowered.<br />
3)	Protagonists are non-human.<br />
4)	Solid world building. Works well as a hi-fantasy series.<br />
<br />
These points summarize Overlord well, and if you find them appealing then this series is just for you. Tired of goody two- shoe protagonists who are holier-than-thou with no moral faults? Overlord’s protagonists are nonhuman and villains.  Have you had enough of linear progression in storytelling, where the protagonist overcomes progressively stronger antagonists, almost conveniently? Overlord’s protagonist and his minions and the minions of his minions are overpowered compared to the vast majority of everything else in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290703">
        the world. This is not a tale about knights in shining armor who save the day. This is about the strong and the weak- with heavy emphasis on the strong. No “friendship triumphs over all” speeches to be found here.<br />
<br />
The last aspect, which does not apply nearly as much to the anime as it does to the light novels it’s based on, is it’s world building. The map is fairly large, with different countries and a large selection of recurring characters representing each country showing up periodically. They all have different traits and while I wouldn’t call most of them “deep,” the little things they do help give the world of Overlord meaning. They’re not cookie-cutter background characters that do the most predictable and straight-ahead thing. It’s showing the world is alive with many individual people pursuing their own goals. The story is basically a “MMO isekai,” but that it doesn’t go as far as others in the same genre. The MMO feature is just used to explain easily the mechanics of the world and just how powerful Ainz and his minions are. You could almost ignore that fact and the plot works just as well. In essence, this series is almost like Lord of the Rings, with the protagonists being villains.<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
<br />
I mentioned in the above two paragraphs the appeal of Overlord&#039;s story and characters. To date the series biggest weakness for the light novels has been pacing. Books 4, 5, 7, and 8 are the weakest entries in the currently 13 volume series, and it was primarily because of that fact. A slew of characters for books 4 and 7 in particular were introduced. Many of them weren’t interesting and most of them weren’t important to the plot beyond their respective books.<br />
<br />
The anime does glaze over many details from the novels. This works both in its favor and to the vexation of hardcore fans. It skips over many of the details which help make the world feel so alive, while also “fixing” some of the pacing problems a few of the middle volumes in the series had. Season 2 was a good representation of this. This third season adapts volumes 7, 8, 9, so expect more of the same in that regard.<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
<br />
The anime’s biggest flaw. Although the CGI they use works out in it’s favor at times, particularly with some battles, at other times it can be jarring. Some animation scenes are lazy, such as the one involving Leinas face in a frame. The goblin battle in episode 11 was borderline comical. It’s unfortunate because So-bin, the illustrator for the novels, does a fantastic job. Sometimes it’s good, but there is a lot of mediocrity here as well.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
There are a couple of good soundtracks used here and some of the sound effects work well. The English dub is also respectable. Overall it’s good, even if it’s not outstanding. I still think the first season had the best OP and OST. Still good, however.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
<br />
There are a lot of them, and like any series this can be both good and bad. With so many characters, it’s hard to get significant development on individual characters. When you do get good development, afterwards they may have long absences from the story when the focus shifts to other characters. On the other hand, having so many characters helps make the world feel alive, and with the wide variety, it gives everyone at least a few characters to care about. <br />
<br />
As mentioned, this series biggest allure is its ridiculously overpowered, nonhuman villain protagonists. Yet neither are they evil for the sake of being evil. They are wholly dedicated to themselves- and if that means killing a few hundred thousand people in the process, then so be it. There’s just something so self-satisfying about seeing a protagonist like that. You don’t get to see that often enough.<br />
<br />
I think an understated emotion for any series is that of admiration. When you admire someone, you tend to overlook their flaws. The relationship between Ainz and his subordinates is a tender one. Unsurprisingly, the light novel does a much better job than with developing it’s characters. The anime is only the general story and cuts some details from the novels.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
<br />
The animation drags it down, but the story is unique and the characters are engaging enough to keep you invested. Ultimately the most satisfying things in life are the things you didn’t know you wanted until you got it. Overpowered, nonhuman, villain protagonists trying to conquer the world in a high-fantasy setting turned out to be just that. If you love Overlord and are still here for season 3, I highly recommend picking up the light novels ASAP.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />

    Franchises like Overlord has a tendency to overrun its ideas with every season. The first season concentrated on Ainz and his goals along with exploring the world fiction while building into the base story. The second season expanded its world although it didn’t exactly live up to its hype when it came to actual character building. Now, here we are. The third season that I crossed my fingers as it’s time for Overlord to prove itself if it’s capable of improving.<br />
<br />
Realistically, I came into the third season with moderate expectations. The first episode didn’t exactly get me excited after seeing everyone getting a reintroduction. Ainz

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290701">
        is still the same as ever while we see the daily lifestyles of his minions. He is trying to live up to his name even though some of his character behavior comes downright as extremely silly. (I mean, he takes a bath in his “skeletal form”. That’s pretty much throws logic out window) No, what we have here is a season that tries to get fans to invested into the story.<br />
<br />
Frequently, I see Overlord’s world as expansive. It explores places with fantasy details that you’d expect from an anime like this and from this season, we visit the Carne Village. Here, we’re introduced to a place where goblins exist. Goblins are a common trend in fantasy shows so seeing them exist this season wasn’t much of an excitement. However, the real attention to pay attention to is a girl named Enri. Serving as a leader of the village, she commits to protect its people and ensure peace. Which is to say, she is a key supporting character this season. One of the more noticeable trends I noticed about Overlord is how it’s able to develop its supporting cast. Enri is a character that I grew to admire for her selflessness and courage. This is especially true with the village facing exterior forces who threatens its peace. Similarly, there’s Nfirea, a character with an inferiority complex yet isn’t afraid to take action when the right time calls for it. <br />
<br />
But meanwhile, there’s also Ainz and his own goals. Supported by his servants and minions, there’s no doubt that world domination is part of their agenda. Yet, Ainz is a calculating character. Despite being incredibly powerful, he isn’t the type that directly goes on the frontlines often. From this season, he commands his servants like Lupisregina on important missions. His other servants such as Demiurge offer their own advice to him. In later episodes, he begins to show a more dominating personality to prove the testament of his powers.<br />
<br />
You better get used to a diverse and growing character cast. In the latter half of the season, we are introduced to Worker Groups of adventurers that includes Foresight, Green Lead, Heavy Masher, and Tenmu. At this point, I feel like it’s where Overlord takes a step back for its character cast. Because let’s face it, some of these characters are going to be jobbed out and treated like fillers. This is proven when some of them fall to victim of the denizens at Nazerick. I can’t even remember some of the names of these adventurers like the one that got tortured by Neuronist Painkill or those killed by monstrous cockroaches. Ainz himself also makes some of these adventurers look fools such as the ones from Foresight. In one particular episode, he shows the difference in their power while crushing all their hope for victory. And to be honest, none of this should come as a surprise. We know how powerful Ainz is and this season continues to prove that. There’s no one who can truly stand a chance against him whether it’s Emperor Jircniv (a character that appeared at end of Season 2) or army by numbers. Even an alliance between The Baharuth Empire and Kingdom’s army feels more like a desperate struggle to survive. When it comes to war, Ainz is able to decimate forces with his powerful arsenal of spells such as summoning death knights and the Dark Young. It’s the type of curb stomp battle that doesn’t last very long. <br />
<br />
With season 3’s unorthodox story structure, I feel like it’s important that they don’t make us forget about its established cast. Remember Albedo or Shalltear from the previous seasons? While they get their moment of fame, it’s definitely not on par when they were first introduced. Others like Sebas is pretty much forgotten despite their development from season 2. To me, that’s a bit of shame since I grew attached to some of the main supporting characters. I do have to admit that Season 3 managed to commit to some of its other supporting cast such as Enri though. Hell, even the goblins became relevant with names given by her. I just wish more characters got treated in such a way.<br />
<br />
By now, the meme of Madhouse not making sequels should be more long disregarded. Not only did Overlord receive a third season but the break is only 3 months. This implied that the second and third season may have been planned as a split cour from the start. Regardless, I feel like Madhouse should’ve committed more time for at least a half year break to boost its production quality. Don’t get me wrong though. The third season definitely had some great visual quality moments especially during some of the battle segments. World building in Overlord still stands out as a prominent feature that people shouldn’t overlook. And those character designs really evoke emotions. Just looking at characters such as Neuronist Painkill or Shalltear’s killing instincts should be enough to get a reaction. Unfortunately, not all reactions for this season will be positive such as the case with the Dark Young. Thanks to the atrocious CGI, their presence reminds me exactly how NOT to adapt character models for a show like this.<br />
<br />
Three seasons of light novel adaptations doesn’t come by too easily these days. And often, they get treated poorly with the pacing or omission of content. Overlord doesn’t fall under those pitfalls but still suffers from its character building at times. I’m not going to lie. I enjoy the novels but this adaptations isn’t really a great representation of value. The fact is, Overlord is a reputation by name but is far from perfection.

    If you&#039;ve watched and liked the other seasons, you&#039;re going to like this. Plain and simple<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On a more serious note, Overlord III is really all of the same stuff that made the first two seasons great: good world building, a grand line of characters, a simple branching out story. The show has a sense of progression and the dynamic between Ainz and the floor guardians is enhanced even more in this season resulting (so far) in a really enjoyable experience. <br />
<br />
Story: 10/8<br />
I give it a biased 10 since, as a Light Novel reader, I know the significance of small details that might feel shoehorned in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285769">
        at the last second. But if I have to rate it off of what happens at the moment, I’d have to give it an 8. <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
CGI in all anime is a crime against humanity and Overlord is no exception. I totally understand how it makes a scene easier to animate and in the newer episode it’s gotten EXPONENTIALLY better, however, CGI will always be CGI.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
OOOOOOH THAT SOUNDTRACK!! Overlord’s soundtrack is amazing ACROSS THE BOARD. However, sometimes it kinda feels repetitive between tracks and it’s a little disheartening. But, for the most part, it’s great.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
Characters in Overlord are more or less a MASTERPIECE. Sometimes characters feel really fleshed out, just to get one shotted in like ten seconds. (This can be considered good or bad depending on your preference)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
It’s Overlord… what more do I have to say?<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
Overlord is my number one Anime and Light Novel of all time. It’s also one of the best isekai of all time. But if I have to be 100% honest in terms of overall quality, they’re a couple of shows that have it beat.<br />
Personally: 10<br />
Realistically: 9 <br />

    AHHHHHHHHHHHHH I could gush over Overlord forever. But for those of you wondering about Season 3, I&#039;m gonna assume you already know what makes Overlord a great show and dive into my thoughts about this current season. <br />
<br />
Watch this show. Season three is showing us that this show has lots more political aspects and character building than ever before, and is starting out, in my opinion, even stronger than in Season two with the lizardmen. This show has amazing potential in its very large cast and dedicates enough time to make you care about them. You WILL be pleased with this season. Bone daddy has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285584">
        not disappointed us before, and he isn&#039;t now.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for everything else, the art, sound (especially the opening), and the feel of the show are great as usual, and its good to be back with this series. Hop on, and get ready for a political Isekai experience done right with this upcoming third season.

    Basically Sword Art Online for people who are too embarrassed to admit they like Sword Art Online or think they&#039;re above it when they&#039;re not. Three seasons in, and Overlord III still manages to be as embarrassingly terrible as the series has ever been. Apparently Madhouse managed to split up the budget for one cour worth into three, and it really shows. How this series is still so popular despite Madhouse&#039;s awful adaptation and the original material&#039;s abysmal writing can be very easily described in two words: Power fantasy.<br />
<br />
But what makes this particular power fantasy so profitable and appealing? <br />
<br />
It&#039;s the fact that the protagonist

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290724">
        is a spooky skeleton man with very stereotypical villainous role archetype assets. Ability to summon undead minions? Powers that generally involve darkness(tm) and death? Completely loyal evil minions that are comically cynical towards humans and also have similar abilities, all with their own gimmicks? He&#039;s got them all, and kids love him. There&#039;s a reason why something like &quot;Dark Flame Master&quot; is a running joke in shows like Chuunibyou, and it&#039;s because it&#039;s pretty common for kids to love the bad guys more than the good guys. They have cool abilities, look cool, and act cool! It&#039;s every kid&#039;s dream to be Dark Flame Master. But does that mean every Overlord fan is a kid or a manchild? Not necessarily. The series does have some merit, but it&#039;s certainly not the animation or the writing. <br />
<br />
The animation is pretty abysmal- The OP animation is incredibly lazily made, and the ED animation is just a slideshow of still images, which goes to demonstrate how little budget went into the show. Add that up with constant stillshots of Ainz&#039;s completely unmoving skeleton face and just embarrassingly common usage of bad looking CGI in nearly every episode, and one could feasibly argue that Madhouse really did split the budget for one cour into three. Even the worst of the worst harem isekai shows tend to have fairly impressive, or at the very least, decent looking openings to pull people in, but it seems that Madhouse knew their fans will eat this shit up regardless of how little money they spend on it. There&#039;s quite literally nothing positive to say about the animation. The soundtrack is pretty mediocre, and doesn&#039;t really distinguish itself from other similar shows, which is also a disappointment. <br />
<br />
Then there is the writing of the show, which is easily the worst part of the series. <br />
<br />
Conceptually, this should be interesting- It&#039;s supposed to be a story from the perspective of the villainous protagonist, which is genuinely rare. Sure, there are plenty of stories where the main character is some variation of demon lord or whatever, but at the end of the day, they still end up being no different from just any generic isekai harem protagonist. Did Ainz manage to separate himself from this common trend? Sure, if being a cardboard with a different coat of paint counts as a separation from the norm.<br />
<br />
The issue with telling a story from a villain&#039;s perspective is that it&#039;s not very easy to make the protagonist likable for the audience to care about. Essentially, when a character becomes too villainous, they become harder to be relatable because they would have to be borderline sociopaths, and the focus shifts from the character to what the character does. One exception to this would be if the character&#039;s motives were interesting or empathetic, but Ainz&#039;s motives are boring as shit and he&#039;s more or less just going by what his minions tell him, so sadly he doesn&#039;t make the list. Ainz has never been interesting as a character, and the focus has always been on the spectacle of what he does with his power, rather than him as a character. Basically, he&#039;s barely a character, and the power he wields is more of a character than Ainz himself. If a main  protagonist is solely defined by their power, then the writing has already irredeemably failed. <br />
<br />
The another issue with this is how this different perspective affects the antagonists of the series, who would naturally be heroes, and rarely other villains that belong to other factions nobody cares about. When the focus is mainly on the villainous protagonist, it becomes difficult to portray the would-be heroic antagonists as anything but generic &quot;good&quot; guys. Normally this wouldn&#039;t be too much of an issue by itself, but yet another major problem makes this a significant issue: Lack of an actual antagonist. Throughout all three seasons, there hasn&#039;t been a single character that was a credible threat to Ainz that also had consistent screentime to get proper development past their character page description. Not only does this make every encounter completely predictable, but it also kills any anticipation for what could happen next because the outcome is always preordained. And when there isn&#039;t an antagonist that fits this criteria, then every heroic antagonist ends up being just carbon copies of another with no distinguishable feature of their own beyond surface-level general characterization and motive. And if they&#039;re not going to be dynamic characters, it makes them harder to empathize with, which in turn, doesn&#039;t make them seem interesting to be distinguishable from every other character. They&#039;re essentially cardboards that just say some cliche&#039;d throwaway lines that a typical protagonist would say, and that&#039;s all there is to them. <br />
<br />
Basically, villains generally don&#039;t need much screentime to begin with, because most of the time, their villainy is portrayed just through their villainous actions. Meanwhile, heroic characters need them, because heroism is a trait that requires empathy. Instead, Maruyama decided that it was a smarter idea to make more irrelevant fodders for Ainz to defeat and conquer, and devote way too much time into their vague, generic characterization that will stop mattering after their inevitable loss. If the writing is good, empathy for the characters should ideally come naturally through storytelling that actually adds to the plot, rather than attempting to force it through Overlord&#039;s patented method of wasting your goddamn time telling you about how Tom loves his kids and how he&#039;s the family man. <br />
<br />
When that isn&#039;t happening, it&#039;s devoted for long inner monologues about the antagonists to think about how strong Ainz and his minions must be, which Ainz and his minions do for themselves already, which just makes it incredibly repetitive and pointless. It&#039;s just shit writing at its finest. And the lack of credible, persisting threat makes every arc feel like a filler arc that serves very little to no purpose to whatever the overarching story is, which is why all three seasons of this series are nearly indistinguishable from each other. The common defense for this is &quot;But Ainz is the threat!&quot; but that completely misses the point. The heroes should ideally be a constant threat to the villains as much as the villains are a constant threat to the heroes. One sided victories are boring as shit when villains are the ones doing it just like how it&#039;s boring when shounen protagonists always win in the end. <br />
<br />
It should be noted that neither an overpowered protagonist nor a story told from a villainous perspective is inherently bad. It&#039;s the combination of the two being handled incompetently at the same time that puts the writing of this series into absolute trash territory. Sadly, Maruyama is a terrible writer, and Overlord as a series is like watching a grown man playing with his action figures alone in his room while indulging himself in the same old dance that he&#039;s done a million times with his self-insert Skeleton Stu that never loses, which really does reflect in Ainz as a character. Maybe this is some galaxy brain tier 4th wall poetry and all Maruyama wants is for his friends to play DnD with him again. <br />
<br />
But just because the writing is complete garbage doesn&#039;t mean it doesn&#039;t have any merit- One of the most common misconceptions is that something bad can&#039;t be enjoyable, which is why a lot of people will really reach to defend the poor writing if they enjoyed the series. Most common method is to cite the original source and pretend it&#039;s better than the adaptation when it&#039;s pretty much just as bad. I mean, if they enjoyed it, clearly it must have been good! Somehow! You just didn&#039;t GET it. But that&#039;s just childish narcissism, and a lot of people fail to understand or just refuse to admit that trashy writing can still be fun. While Overlord may be just as poorly written as Sword Art Online, what it has over SAO is that the spectacle is sometimes genuinely fun to watch when the focus of the series isn&#039;t on the side characters, albeit repetitive and poorly animated. And that&#039;s basically what the appeal of power fantasy is- Watching smug protagonists stay smug while watching smug antagonists getting blown up.

    If you fell in love with watching Ainz explore the world as the adventure Momonga trying to spread his name, doing quests, interacting with different characters and doing epic shit- basically everything that made Overlord season 1 enjoyable and garnered so much popularity in the first place, well you can kiss that goodbye. Warning, spoilers included.<br />
<br />
Everything that was enjoyable about the first season goes downhill in the second season. In this season, that’s where it goes to shit. The story shifts it’s focus once again onto the side characters, politics, how Ainz affects the world and world building. If you’ve watched season 2, that seems

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287296">
        to be the premise of Overlord now. However, the writer can’t even do that right and fails at every turn.<br />
<br />
Plot: (1/10):<br />
Assuming you’ve seen the previous seasons already, I’ll keep this brief:<br />
Ainz is a neet, self-insert, overpowered Overlord to everyone in Nazarick. Here he’s worshipped and adored by his guardians as they treat him like a god who can do no wrong, and Ainz assumes the role of being a supreme ruler. Ainz’s motivation becomes doing what he believes best benefits Nazarick instead of focusing on I don’t know... trying to find a way back home (because fuck that when you’re a Overlord amirite?)<br />
 <br />
As for the plot this season? There’s not much of a story. It just so happens that all of the events Ainz has committed and the fame he’s spread across the world as Momonga was conveniently all setup for his master plan to rule the world or at least that’s what Demiurge says and Ainz agrees. It’s poor writing, I know.<br />
<br />
The first step for Ainz to rule the world is to create his own country and to do that he needs a village to test on for reasons unclear. The first 7 episodes focuses on Carne Village. The next few episodes focuses on these workers who get staged by Ainz to try invade Nazarick so he can kill them for trespassing and use it as an excuse to start a war. The plan was so awful that I stopped caring. The rest of the season focuses on the Empire, the newly founded Sorcerer Kingdom led by Ainz, and the war where they demanded the Kingdom cede over the city of E-Rantel. <br />
<br />
The arcs follow the same repetitive formula of introducing a bunch of new characters e.g. a new race/species, spend a couple of episodes giving them screentime and then have Ainz or his guardians either enslave or kill them. Rinse and repeat and you have Overlord. <br />
<br />
Characters (1/10):  <br />
What do you already know about Ainz and the guardians? Well, it’s pretty much the same this season. They receive no meaningful character development or exploration, since it focuses on the uninteresting side characters that you’ll end up forgetting once you’ve watched this season. <br />
<br />
The side stories are awful. Every time the POV shifts from Ainz it’s infuriatingly boring because the side characters we spend several episodes with are bland, weak and uneccessary.<br />
<br />
Enri is a cliche, “nice” village girl who everyone loves and becomes the village chief because the plot required her to. Otherwise no sane person would put a village girl in charge. Enri is a clear case of writers pet, getting everything handed to her (becoming the village chief and now owning her own massive goblin army) because she’s a plot device to show the progression of the village. Nphi is a beta potion boy who’s a pussy and has a crush on Enri. If you thought the lizard men were bad, the goblins are another level of trash. The goblins are  so one dimensional, their only trait is arguing about who likes Enri more. At least a few of the lizard men had some depth to them, these goblins don’t even have names ffs.<br />
<br />
The workers are one dimensional forgettable fodder who’s only role is to jobb against Ainz for trespassing, be killed for shock value, and to remind us how “evil he is”. Arche’s the only one we learn a bit about with her being broke and wanting to take her sisters away from her parents, but that’s about it. Oh yeah, there’s a bootleg Gilgamesh too<br />
<br />
Animation (1/10):<br />
It’s as if Madhouse realised that Overlord goes to shit after s1 and stop putting effort in because the animation has declined as well. The art is worse this season than s2. The CGI is Berserk (2016) levels of trash e.g. look up Ainz massacre 70 000 soldiers instantly and you’ll see how laughably bad it was. <br />
<br />
That being said, I can overlook bad CGI as long as the writing is great. However, Overlord hasn’t been delivering in that aspect either. LN readers kept overhyping “SPLAT SPLAT SPLAT!” for weeks, but I wouldn’t have enjoyed it if it had OPM tier animation. The “slaughter fest” of Ainz massacring 70k soldiers in a instant and ugly ass goats stomping generic, snobby nobles was shock value and another excuse for Ainz to flex how overwhelmingly overpowered he is compared to everyone. “Sasuga Ainz-Sama!!1!”<br />
<br />
Sounds (3/10):<br />
The opening is one of the few saving graces of this season. S3’s opening is one of my favourites so far. However, the OSTs are pretty much the same as the previous seasons, uninspired and forgettable.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (1/10):<br />
Honestly, I hated this season. The fact that there’s no struggle whatsoever in Overlord and that all the strongest characters are serving under Ainz has made me come to despise this series.<br />
<br />
Where are the guild players? Will there ever be a real threat?<br />
<br />
Ainz and his guardians are so ridiculously overpowered that every fight/conflict is always the same repetitive, one-sided, curb stomp that it’s not even fun to watch anymore.<br />
<br />
There’s no semblance of stakes, tension or difficulty for anything they do. The weaker characters can’t even outsmart Ainz because he’s always 5 steps ahead and his plans always go off without a hitch. Idc about how great ‘muh world building’ is, or how Ainz affects the world because knowing that he’ll always come out on top has made the story become boring and predictable. There’s no plot twist to spice up the story. It’s wish fulfilment, nothing more.<br />
<br />
Ainz can just launch a full scale attack using all his guardians and be done with conquering the world in a month or two, find out the information about his friends and solve the mystery to go home. Yet we are dragging on to what would seem 100+ episodes, across multiple seasons on giving screentime and developing all these uneccesary side characters (e.g. lizardmen, goblins) who will always end up being fodder compared to the gods that are fighting (Ainz &amp; the guardians). The writer tries to come up with some convenient, shitty reason of ‘Ainz not wanting to rule by power/fear’, but he’s supposed to be a evil protagonist!<br />
<br />
Overall (1/10):<br />
Overlord has devolved into a dragged out, pointless story with uninteresting side characters, uneccessary horny scenes with Albedo &amp; Shaltear, and the guardians sucking off how great Ainz is all the damn time. We get it! “Sasuga Ainz-Sama!” has gotten old and is just annoying at this point. Overlord is simply a emotionless, evil skeleton and his giant harem killing everyone who opposes them like they’re squashing ants.<br />
<br />
I can’t fathom why fans praise Overlord so much, giving it such high reviews because “muh world building”, despite it being a typical, power fantasy isekai about a overpowered, Gary Stu MC who’s the magic user equivalent to Kirito.

    The art is good, the sound is good, and that is where the good things end. Everything that was enjoyable and novel about the first season was tarnished in the second season. In this new season, they were driven through the ground and stepped on. The cool new &quot;rule the world&quot; idea that drove the anime is now gone. Now there is just a village full of weak, needy, annoying, and UNNECESSARY characters. From a little potion maker who is on his way to making a potion 1/100 as useful as those made by Ainz to a weak and pointless village chief who is there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review286616">
        for literally no reason other than Ainz gave her a damn flute full of weak goblins. This entire season so far has been pointless. Why are Ainz&#039;s extremely OP maids risking their lives just to save these little shits? I don&#039;t care about the village, I don&#039;t care about the goblins, and I absolutely don&#039;t care about this useless diplomacy with a government that Ainz could crumble with a snap of his fingers. I see no point in their complete reroute from &quot;take the world by force&quot; to &quot;lets just protect these humans that we have made it extremely clear that we despise.&quot; Isn&#039;t the whole point of the show that Ainz has no emotions and is now a skeleton bent on ruling the world? WHERE IS THAT? It&#039;s like it went from Game of Thrones OP version to a video of a really long and really boring NATO conference. What I&#039;m trying to say is that they need to bring back the entertaining parts because they are making an entertaining series boring and stupid with all the comedy and the incorporation of useless and weak side characters who bring nothing to the table. Kill off the side characters and let Ainz rule the world, that&#039;s all I ask for.

    Overlords 3rd season continues the overrated story of anime’s most beloved skeleton without facial animations.<br />
VERDICT: 3 – Bad.<br />
<br />
STORY: Slow, boring and confusing.<br />
3rd season starts with a filler episode and proceeds with mediocrity and boredom from then on. The drive behind every action in this show is not apparent to the viewer, so that in the end I was questioning the events happening on screen. Why was Ainz destroying Carne Village again? <br />
Next topic is the pacing. Boi does this season move S L O W. In addition, it is void of any substance, significant characterization or development. Noteworthy action – also nonexistent. <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: Huh? <br />
We

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290734">
        get to see more reoccurring characters in this season, Overlord himself being one of them, since his presence in the 2nd season was minimal. Maybe it was this long absence from the viewer, but Mr Momonga turned into a sadistic psycopath. It was hinted, that due to his undead nature Ainz loses affection towards humans, however presented changes are sudden and harsh, some in between stages would make this development plausible. Oh, and he got another name tagged on to his greatness. What a conceptional disaster. <br />
The second most important character is the blond girl from the 1st season, whatever her name was. Well, she develops some useful skills, reasoning behind this development is yet unknown. <br />
Everyone else is just there as a requisite. <br />
<br />
ART &amp; ANIMATION: Wouldn’t look good 15 years ago. <br />
Character models are inconsistent and backgrounds thrive in mediocrity. Animation did not strain the budget either. Just like horrific CGI. Mass produced soldiers, goblins, skeletons or ogres look unbelievably bad, nothing you would expect in 2018: especially those abominations in episode 12.<br />
<br />
SOUND: They gave up. <br />
It feels like everyone on this project, be it voice actors or music composers, have enough of this IP. Music is more of the same, sound design got worse or even laughable. Voice act is boring. I was missing new impusles or joy from involved stuff. Then episode 12 happened and I wanted to stab my ears – well done.<br />
<br />
One day before the final episode aired, I got a chance to see “Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken”. The amount of emotions or joy blue slime blob shows in 15 minutes surpasses 3 seasons of Overlord. If you are looking for “Isekai” anime with an overpowered non-human protagonist and noticeably better production quality, I suggest the story of the slime. <br />

    Based on the reviews, you will either love or hate this show. I already gave a couple of chances with the show, but I failed to like any single detail about it. If I could describe this show, it would be like this: a knight plans a great adventure, yet he moves around insignificant villages to bully peasants with very slow pace. Peasants from other villages don&#039;t care about his power, so few of them gather and attack him no matter that he&#039;s got thick armor and a powerful sword. He beats them and other peasants. That&#039;s what Overlord is about, if you like an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290782">
        overpowered protagonist who flexes to everyone around after a long drama, you may like this show.<br />
<br />
So, the story is poor as usual. It&#039;s so prolonged that it&#039;s painful to watch, a simple event lasts episodes, full of insignificant events, characters and other stuff. The same formula from previous seasons, lots of long moments where everyone adores Ainz, the moments where something happens and Ainz goes there, long drama starts, new characters are introduced, a drama before action, Ainz snaps his finger and enemies are dead, the end. It&#039;s also little odd that Ainz spent time on adventures to spread his name and power, yet some kingdom hasn&#039;t heard of him and, of course, played ignorant role - &quot;hey, let&#039;s destroy this nobody!&quot;, like every other enemy of Ainz in previous seasons. Also... All the events are done to show his power, no matter that they are recycled over and over, ignoring the logic and some characters lose their brain for a while to do something stupid which would just keep the image of Ainz being the most powerful being in the world.<br />
<br />
After giving rights on One Punch Man to focus on Overlord, I was stunned that Madhouse came up with this, a studio which has made some great shows and movies. The art is mediocre at its best, but CGI is horrendous. The sound is so-so, nothing special.<br />
<br />
Characters are flat like in previous seasons. The continuous problem with the show is that way too many characters are introduced, only simple premises are shown (whether they do stuff for money, fame or duty) and they don&#039;t last long at all, after some generic chit-chat they enter combat and die. The harem continues to adore Ainz all the time and make pathetic threats to humans who are trying to fight Ainz. Ainz doesn&#039;t seem much like a generic harem wimpy protagonist, but that&#039;s mostly because the focus is more on things outside Nazarick. We don&#039;t learn anything new about Ainz and the harem, all the new characters are on the spot and get thrown away after they made their purpose to make Ainz look powerful.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment? The show could have been fit in one episode. It&#039;s way too long, the conversations are dull and boring, the &quot;action&quot; is done in an instant. I don&#039;t even know what this show is supposed to be - a shounen, a harem, a comedy, a dark themed show, a fantasy world, a drama? The harem characters are shows as cute and innocent at one moment, the next moment they are horny and want to please Ainz, later they try to look scary and threaten some people. You cannot mix so many things without a bad outcome, I don&#039;t know whether LN is like that, even if it is, anime creators should have picked two themes, for example dark fantasy, that could work. Not so many elements to make everything last long and pathetic attempts of comedy or dark moments which confused me that I wondered what was I watching. <br />
<br />
If you want to watch or read something with fantasy theme, check out Warhammer, LOTR or Dungeons and Dragons, unless you want a pathetic story about an overpowered protagonist who beats nobodies to prove himself that he&#039;s the most powerful being in the world.

    So i like overlord a lot. The character development in these 4 episodes have been great. I feel like that&#039;s what lacked in season 2, The first few episodes were about new &#039;&#039;characters&#039;&#039; that were lizard men. We didnt really get any interactins with the supreme being i feel like. <br />
<br />
If your looking for an isekai anime i would reccomend overlord most of the time because it&#039;s way better then most isekai anime&#039;s i have seen. <br />
<br />
What i didnt really like about season 3 is that it&#039;s kind of getting repetitive. Ainz is trying to bullshit his way out of the questions of the supreme

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285364">
        being&#039;s. We see him trying to expand his territory. It&#039;s getting kind of boring honestly. <br />
<br />
Overlord needs to end with a bang like in the first season.

    This anime thus far i have been anxiously waiting a week with a alarm on my phone to catch it as soon as it airs, which is hard to find an anime that does that for me. This season of overlord has finally showed a lot of action and comedy compared to the others this is the best season so far showing <br />
<br />
Some nice action throughout the entire show, <br />
and much needed lore about the world of Yggdrasil <br />
<br />
However there are some scenes with CGI But they are relatively short and easy to watch  If you liked the first two seasons then Overlord III

          <span style="display: none;" id="review288456">
        is a must watch, it reminds me heavily of One Punch Man but more MMO overall rating 10/10

    Story (8/10)<br />
You know when people say, &quot;The book is better than the movie&quot;? Well, in this case its the same thing, except its a show. The 24 minute episode force Madhouse to have to cut out a lot of stuff making this inconsistent story. People sometimes say to read the light novel but that is just silly. Why should you need to read a whole book to just understand a show. If all parts of the story were to be in the show it would go well beyond the 24 minute mark so they have to cut some content but that sometimes just breaks the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289410">
        immersion. Not only that but the world building episodes are often long and boring. World building is necessary yes, but in this case the anime spent way too long on it and focused solely on it. It became more of a side story than anything making it feel like a filler episode. <br />
<br />
(For anime only watchers I recommend reading Djinn&#039;s Posts in the Reddit Discussion of Overlord III episodes Just Google Overlord 3 episode # discussion and scroll down till you find his post)<br />
<br />
Art (8/10)<br />
For the most part, the art is great, everything looked nice and was quite beautiful, however, the CG was to say the least, unrealistic. Especially in episode 11, (Which at the time of this review, is the latest episode) the anime did a nice job of portraying the numbers of the army, but each of the models looked so bland and unrealistic, the movement was fine, but it just did not fit with the art style. Pulling me out of the immersion<br />
<br />
Sound(10/10)<br />
The OP and ED are phenomenal and I do like the soundtrack quite a bit. I never felt like the sound was distracting, but enhancing the overall the experience. Although I can not recall a specific time, I got chills whenever a character is overwhelmed at a sight of a huge army or absolute power.<br />
<br />
Character(9/10)<br />
If anything, the world building also helped shape the character building. We get a good sense of what the characters personalities are just from their design but when the show goes more in depth we see it more or see a hidden side (Such as lupus&#039;s sadistic nature).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(9/10)<br />
I did enjoy the show quite a bit, from Ainz&#039;s show of power, the ironic humor, and the not so humorous death of the workers. 24 minutes of content felt like only 5 and I was always eager to watch the newest episode. If anything the part I did not enjoy was a the slow pace of the world building but that is about it.<br />
<br />
Overall(9/10)<br />
The combination of Characterization, Art, and sound help elevate the story and the only things holding it back is the CG and its own time constraint.

    Why Overlord III get a 6/10 to me?<br />
It&#039;s going NOWHERE!<br />
I&#039;m enjoying the show since season 1 but the story never focus on why Momonga is in the game, never show a sign of other players in the game, there is no evolution on the story.<br />
The fact that he don&#039;t face any real challenge is extremely annoying, the other annoying fact is about Momonga&#039;s personality, the power inhibiting his feelings makes you never know if he is a hero or just a fucking dictator, and again, THERE IS NO EXPLANATIONS!<br />
The anime create too much mysteries with no conclusions, it opens the story to the minor characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285704">
        whitout explaining the main event, feels like the author don&#039;t know where it&#039;s going so far.<br />
But, it have pros, the animation and the sounds are amazing, thanks for the standard quality of Mad House, and that keeps me whatching it.

    This review perhaps late for a bit. Including the trilogy of this series.<br />
As a famous anime, Overlord growth and landed to the surface without any significant obstacles. However, I wish my review will encourage you to measure this anime and motivate those of you who haven&#039;t watched it.<br />
<br />
Before we begin, let&#039;s put aside the experience of original story about this anime (LN).<br />
<br />
As an isekai, Overlord has a unique form structuristic inside their story. This anime successfully delivers the story with a gloom atmosphere into a specific levels. Righteously as a King who attaches importance of his worshipers, Ainz (the main character) continues to walks inside

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368704">
        the new world by cling firmly head to the important things that he deems profitable. Away from selfishness and carelessness, Ainz&#039;s character developed with an open considerate mind. What he always planned is not just sketch a plan to steps and traverse tomorrow, it&#039;s more structured than that. Although in fact, Ainz&#039;s movement ideas and information are stemmed from a misunderstanding that it melted into the next progression. Resulted a pattern of progression towards the plot that was further away than I expected. I love how naturally Ainz&#039;s characters inadvertently affect the plot, also the time when he showed his decision to make choices. I considerer that moment as a greatful wisdom. Overlord also covers the effectiveness behind the timeline. Growed along with the main plot, the side roles are blessed with opportunities to continue support the storyline until it climax. It&#039;s amazing, because there is no minus side that I really underestimate as the destroyers here.<br />
<br />
The art style were also supportive and conducively in line with the atmosphere from the background story at certain moments. They can be very gloomy, doomie or really attractive to watch, depending on what audiences should to expected about the scheme. Even though some of the fans feel the art style is lacking. In my opinion, this art is quite feasible to convey the story until the phase where every momment is clearly captured in it.<br />

This anime would be suitable for those of you who like to see the main character who thinks in logically. Especially for you who loved a main character with mature and firm side (not childish). This anime is OP, but not the typical OP that appears when particular things are pressed then it rapidly increase the power because of friendly bonds.

    How to Overlord in 4 steps:<br />
<br />
1) Introduce random characters<br />
<br />
2) Give them a little backstory and make them take a lot of screen time<br />
<br />
3) Kill them &quot;for the benefit of Nazarick&quot; or enslave them &quot;for the benefit of Nazarick&quot;<br />
<br />
4) Repeat<br />
<br />
We&#039;ve already seen this format since S2. Do you remember the lizardmen? The giant Hamster? Tuare? Maybe, probably not though. Not even their names.<br />
<br />
They took up so much screen time and then become unimportant, it&#039;s not interesting anymore.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, S3 follows the same path, and only a handful of episodes are actually progressing the story, while 80% of the anime is &quot;fillers&quot;<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been told many times that it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290719">
        for &quot;World Building&quot; but one does not come at the cost of another. See One Piece, and Made in Abyss to some extent. Both have worldbuilding that comes along with an actual story. <br />
<br />
We still don&#039;t know anything about the &quot;other players&quot; that might&#039;ve been Isekai&#039;d as well, and Ainz is the same geek who plays like a lord. And ofc everyone wants his D.<br />
<br />
There are no more cool adventures of Adventurer Momonga like in S1, it&#039;s just &quot;Let&#039;s slaughter people because it &#039;Benefits Nazarick&#039;&quot; now.<br />
<br />
Combine it with horrible CGI and here you go, a recipe for disaster.<br />
<br />
One more thing, imagine the titans in AoT. They&#039;re scary, right?<br />
<br />
Now make them in horrible CGI. Not so scary, are they?<br />
<br />
And now for the cherry on top, make the exact same goat voice line play every few seconds. Yes, a GOAT voice line.<br />
<br />
Wat<br />
<br />
<br />
At least OP and ED were good.

    To put it bluntly: If you liked the previous 2 seasons, you&#039;ll enjoy this. <br />
However, you must understand that this anime does have quite a bit of world building and its necessary to further enhance the story so bare with it.<br />
<br />
Another thing to note is that this anime isnt you typical Isekai anime. The main story  n all seasons are about ainz and his comrades who are NOT hero&#039;s. This is an Antihero show at heart. so if your ok with that then you&#039;ll be fine, otherwise you will be disgusted and angry at some parts so beware.<br />
<br />
art is fantastic, madhouse did a great

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287736">
        job blending typical animation with CG.<br />
<br />
sounds is also fantastic, sound effects and voices are great.<br />
<br />
characters are diverse and well introduced.<br />
<br />
the story is good however with the pacing the show takes and the fact that it is only a 13ep season, it can feel rushed. IMO this should of been 26ep per season show from the beginning as the show Leaves ALOT out from the LN&#039;s.<br />

    Just a few words about my disappointement. Minor spoilers ahead.<br />
<br />
The show&#039;s main character Ainz Ooal Gown degrades from a dark but somehow respectable person (that saves Gazef, gives Enri an artifact to protect her village and avenges his teammates by killing Clementine) to an immoral psychotic madman that brutally slays, tortures and sends to a horrifull experiments hundreds of thousands of people. During those henocides, he hardly shows any signs of remorse, while his subordinates laugh and joke about what is happening.<br />
Not only this is abominable — this is also pathetic, knowing that behind the image of almighty &quot;Ainz-sama&quot; hides nothing more than a trembling

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321599">
        nerd that achieved nothing in his own world — a being lower than any of the people he slain trying to become the &quot;Overlord&quot;.<br />
This action, around which revolves the main storyline, is plain appalling. And hence, the whole anime deserves nothing else.<br />
<br />
Last time I checked, I wanted to relax by watching a bit silly, but nonetheless entertaining fantasy series; not an anime version of &quot;Black Sun 731&quot;.<br />
But well, I guess some of japanese people just still have it in them.
