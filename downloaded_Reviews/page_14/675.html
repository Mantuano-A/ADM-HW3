    Bloom Into You is not a romance. Rather, it is a love story about self-realization. <br />
<br />
The series follows the titular late bloomer, Yuu Koito, a girl who has never felt love before. Since she was young she has dreamed of falling in love, romanticizing the day when it would happen. Expecting to be swept off her feet, eventually. But that day has never come, even when someone confesses to her she feels nothing. This has kept her from fully connecting to her friends and peers, they are far more understanding of what they want romantically. She was alone until she met Tokou Nanami. A girl

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297170">
        who has also never experienced love, until she met Yuu. <br />
<br />
To Yuu&#039;s surprise, Touko suddenly confesses to her, and while she does not reciprocate due to her inability to love, she allows Touko to be in love with her. The one condition Touko sets for Yuu is to never love her back. From here on, the tale of self-discovery begins, as each character learns from the other about who they are. At the start of the show Yuu seems like your typical blank slate protagonist devoid of the ability to love, but look further and you’ll see her personality is surprisingly realistic. Yuu is the type of person who cares for others deeply but masks it beneath a veneer of logic and normalcy. She possesses many of the telltale signs of sexual repression, her loneliness and lack of romantic feelings are just a few examples. Throughout the show, we see her pushing through boundaries she would have previously avoided, gaining more control of her life, she reflects on who she is and gains a better understanding of her own identity. This is why labeling Bloom Into You as a romance would be only half true; while it features people in love, it is more complicated than that. Before Yuu can love she has to face the realization what she wants, who she is.<br />
<br />
Without a doubt, Bloom Into You depicts homosexual youth more realistically than I have seen in any anime before. Highlighting even the most minuscule of details that only someone who has experienced firsthand can convey believably. For example, in the first episode, Yuu’s father lets slide a casually homophobic comment about worrying that she isn’t in a relationship with someone of the same sex. After this line comes, the director smash cuts to Yuu in dismay at what he said. The tone sharply changes from moment to moment like this on many occasions to great success because of the subtly to which it is executed. <br />
<br />
In comparison to Yuu, Touko is rather different in that she knows exactly what she wants and would die before she relinquished her purpose. Touko wants to love Yuu because she can be vulnerable with her, she wants desperately for Yuu to always be there to comfort her. However, she can’t stand the thought of being loved in return by Yuu because of her own insecurities. Throughout the series we see her personality pulled apart and analyzed thoroughly, she is rather basic upon first impression, but look further and there is far more to her than meets the eye. If Yuu were to love her, she would be conflicted, because in her mind she can’t possibly be loved. It&#039;s an upsetting conflict that she endures, but incredibly effective in engaging anyone who has experienced similar insecurities.<br />
<br />
Overall, these story beats are delivered with an impressive amount of grace and panache. The dialogue feels very natural, Yuu’s interactions with her friends are realistic and believable. Most of all, the supporting characters are consistent. They don’t have random lapses in their personalities, and if anything changes there’s an explanation for it in their lives. For example, if a character is acting awkward towards the suggestion of seeing a romance movie, it’s because they had their heart broken recently and needed a push to mention it to their friends. There&#039;s a layer of depth to everyone that is far greater than what is expected of not only yuri, but anime in general. <br />
<br />
This is also the rare explicitly lesbian show that does not fetishize its characters at all. Touko is very clear about her romantic and physical attraction to Yuu; likewise, Yuu is very clear about her lack of ability to love. Both are treated like fully realized people instead of objects. In figuring out themselves and what they mean to eachother, they do run into a few issues. Nevertheless their relationship is still built on communication, consent, and respecting boundaries. They’re a likable duo and it’s easy to get invested in their development. When the first kiss happens non-consensually, it is apologized for immediately, then it never occurs again. The author very deftly avoids, as well as subverts, the Class-S tropes negatively associated with the yuri genre. <br />
<br />
Class-S usually refers to yuri that do not allow their characters to get into serious relationships, they are in high school and have time to play around before they get married to men when they graduate. The author of Bloom Into You has said on a few occasions that this is not a yuri, rather it is a story about girls and love. Understandably she wants to distance her story from negative connotations associated with the genre. Notably, this anime features a healthy adult lesbian relationship, showcasing that there is more to being homosexual and female outside of the scandalous high school melodrama. We also see a supporting character who faced the issue of her lesbian relationship being nullified under the pretense that &#039;it&#039;s just a phase&#039;, and from this, she develops into a wonderfully nuanced character. <br />
<br />
On the production side, Bloom Into You is magnificent. Beautiful visual storytelling, the storyboards convey characters inner emotions in engaging ways, it is very visually interesting. There are occasional breathtaking moments of sakuga, but what impresses more is the director&#039;s keen eye for editing to clue us in onto how a character is feeling at any given moment. If emotions are obscured it is deliberately so, if they are shown then you have to take into account every little detail given to the audience. One of the best moments of visual storytelling in the first episode is when a rush of water divides Yuu from her friends; this shot perfectly conveys how her lack of understanding of herself divides her from the average teenager. Aside from just visual metaphors, how the story plays out is representative of the internal struggles Yuu and Touko face. The play that Touko desperately wants to enact is a tale of a woman without memories who needs to pick a desirable personality for herself, reflecting her insecurity and desire to better herself. <br />
<br />
Punctuating each emotional beat are melancholic piano keys loudly implying the turmoils each character is enduring, and each of them is developed consistently enough for the musical accompaniment to feel very deserved. This is contrasted with melodic orchestral pieces to match the upbeat tone of scenes when characters come together and express heartwarming joy. With a talented and experienced composer like Michiru Oshima producing the soundtrack, the show’s audiovisual splendor blends together with its script wonderfully.<br />
<br />
To say that Bloom Into You took me by surprise would be an understatement. At first, its unusually realistic characters blindsided me; Yuu and Touko are superbly nuanced people. They&#039;re lost in the dark trying to find their way through a first relationship just as real people in their situation would. The many relevant themes this series tackles are what give the cast such believability and relatability unlike any other anime in this genre; self-loathing, societal expectations, homophobia, and sexual repression to name a few. Each theme is delivered respectfully and with subtlety. In the first few episodes, the pacing is quite slow, but always purposefully so, and once it gains speed it becomes enrapturing. <br />
<br />
Without a doubt, Bloom Into You is the best anime I watched from this season, perhaps even the year. It is a masterfully crafted, unforgettable experience that will leave an impact on me for years to come.

    Love takes shape that the universe may never have a precise answer on. Can we all agree that human emotions can never be truly understood? What does it mean to be in love? Why do people fall for each other? In our world of imperfection, we will never know the truth to this question. Humans are imperfect and we were built that way in the eyes of our creator.<br />
<br />
The art of anime adaptations is a fascinating subject that takes many forms. I’m very open minded with just about any genre although when it comes to yuri and shoujo-ai, I’m rather indifferent about it. Recent adaptations

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297163">
        of the shoujo-ai genre hardly made an impression on me such as Citrus or Netsuzou Trap. Both of those shows let me down big time with their aggressive stance on relationships. I wanted to see a softer side of the shoujo-ai genre without subscribing to sexual same gender relationships that relies on shock service. Thankfully, Yagate Kimi no Naru is the answer.<br />
<br />
I’m not too familiar with the community related to shoujo-ai works but it’s clear that the manga has popularity. The series was launched in April 2015 from the Monthly Comic Dengeki Daioh and in the present, it has over 500k printing copies and ongoing. However, I was also curious about the anime adaptation after seeing the staff involved. Director Makoto Katou made a rather interesting impression back in 2015 when they directed a mystery light novel adaptation called “Beautiful Bones: Sakurako’s Investigation”. While this series doesn’t contain much mystery, it definitely made me wonder if it has a similar mystique. Indeed, watching Yagate Kimi ni Naru (Bloom Into You) finally gave me a shoujo-ai that I desired.<br />
<br />
Right off the bat, we meet Yuu Koito, a first-year high school student who has a love for shoujo manga. From her perspective, it’s easy to see what love is on a fictional level. It isn’t until a second-year student named Touko Nanami comes into her life that she really begin to experience what life and love is. Similar to Yuu, Touko also has trouble experiencing love although it’s clear that her mind is set to understand it. As a student, she is very admirable for her dependable personality and someone the freshmen look up to. However, all this seems to be masking her insecurity. The truth is, Touko has many weaknesses underneath her cool persona. It’s shown throughout the series that she feels loneliness due to her past and Yuu becomes the only person that she trusts in. On the other hand, Yuu seems to be more wary about love and wants to experience it. However, her view towards love is not as dedicated as Touko. She wants to experience love but often denies feelings of it. Yuu’s personality is more the opposite of Touko’s as she is indecisive at times, including her own future. So to say the least, how can these two develop a genuine relationship?<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think the main draw of the show isn’t to see if the main characters can get together as a couple. Rather, it’s about how characters experience love and what love really means to them. Realistically, both characters views love in different ways although it’s clear that they lack experience in it. Touko is the more obvious with her insecure personality where she often isn’t sure what to do to make happy moments with Yuu. On the other hand, Yuu often believes what she experiences to be more of a fantasy than actual love. I guess part of that comes from reading all those shoujo manga although as the series progresses, she begins to grow out of her shell. The storytelling continues to test the two’s relationship on many levels. It’s a show that capitalizes on bringing in drama and thankfully, I can say that it accomplishes that very well. The drama sells with the character personalities, behaviors, dialogues, and realistic feelings. I’m also more pleased to say that everything in the show felt very real. Characters behave like humans do especially for high school students of their age. It’s a time period when young people want to get the best out of their lives and love is often a prominent part of growing up. To me, this show manages to capture the essence of character growing up while discovering what love is about.<br />
<br />
While Yuu and Touko are the most prominent characters, it’s hard to take eyes off of some of the others. Sayaka Saeki is a good example as someone who used to attend an all-girls school and became a close friend with Touko. The two work together as part of the student council but it’s very clear that Sayaka sees her more than a friend. Love is the easiest way to describe it. It’s also easy to see why she falls for her too considering their similar personalities. Both Sayaka and Touko are hardworking individuals who are willing to help others. However, Sayaka is perhaps less outgoing compared to Touko and thus, not as easily as approachable. The series doesn’t dedicate to their relationship but it’s interesting to see Sayaka’s vision of love. In essence, she hides her feelings and is not someone that’s easy to read on the surface. This is a contrast to both Yuu and Touko as those two tends to say what’s on their mind. On a lesser extent, we also get to see the relationship between Miyako and Riko which is shown to be very healthy in nature. Their relationship is relaxing and almost like a contrast to the drama that we see so often in the story.<br />
<br />
As for the shoujo-ai genre, I think it’s pretty easy to recognize that pretty much all the main characters are lesbians in one way or another. Some are to a lesser but it’s pretty clear from the start. What were you expecting though? The anime advertised itself as such with the same gender relationships so be prepared to subscribe to that from start to finish. But as a show with a lot of drama, I should say to watch this with a careful focus on the characters. Watch for what they say, how they behave, and their intentions. For me, I find the most complex character to be Yuu since her personality is often sarcastic and believes too much into fictional love. This is true especially in the beginning where it became hard to know what she really wants. The more I watched though, the more I came to accept Yuu for who she is and her quest to discover love. And that’s what I find so entrancing about this show.<br />
<br />
In perhaps a coincidental timeline, we also get Troyca as the studio. It&#039;s the same one that worked on Sakurako’s Investigation with the exact same director. As my first impression, this anime managed look colorful and vibrant with its character designs. There’s a feminine charm for the majority of the cast that really brings the elegance out of the characters. The emotional context are captured with the vivid details of body language and human expressions. The background visual quality is also stellar with a certain degree feeling of photorealism. Some of the scenes during the mid-season episodes like the ones with the bridge stands out the most. Last but not least, I would like to mention that character voice mannerism for the main cast is portrayed with supreme talent. Not only did I feel attached to their personalities, these characters also sounded like they belong in this anime from the beginning.<br />
<br />
Ah, it’s about damn time. I’ve been indifferent about shoujo-ai shows for a good while but after seeing Yagate Kimi ni Naru, I may change my mind. This show managed to capture the expression of love in ways that exceed my expectations. It seized opportunities to recreate a sensational drama without stepping over the line. Keep your pants on because you’re not going to get sexual shock content all over your face. What you get is a drama done right in the most entrancing way possible. It&#039;s almost perfect.

    This show is average. Not bad, not good. Just average. That being said, I wasn’t entertained watching this, not even from laughing at how bad it was, because it wasn’t bad. It was just average. Despite what most people think, being average isn’t a terrible thing, so as a little disclaimer, I am not saying everything about this show sucks for everyone who might take this review badly.<br />
<br />
The show is very clearly, a romance genre. The key to any good romance media is the relationship: nothing else matters that much. My problem with the show is that it doesn’t try to make the relationships between

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297231">
        our main characters all that interesting. An issue with many yuri or yaoi animes are that they use the idea that they are in a gay relationship to hide the fact that there is no real substance or development; they are too lazy to create anything interesting about the relationship besides the fact that they’re lesbians. The setting isn’t the issue either as there are a ton of romance anime that do well in mundane settings (and even if a romance media is set in a more unconventional and/or radical setting- the relationships itself isn’t taken over by the setting) because romance genres aren’t really supposed to be about exterior factors that govern the story&#039;s universe per say, rather a device to tell a love story. My point being, the environment or exterior factors shouldn’t be the most important part overshadowing the characters, but should be used as an effective agent in portraying a relationship. However, Bloom Into You makes this mistake repeatedly throughout its course as boring subplots distract us from the main focus of the anime, the relationship.<br />
<br />
So why was the relationship so uninteresting? Or, at least why did I subjectively find it bland? Well, it has to do with the romance development/buildup and characterization. A great romance anime that does this very well is Kimi Ni Todoke. There are certainly a lot of cute romance scenes in Bloom Into You, but it isn’t memorable or as effective as they could be. This is because there is no real buildup to the romance scenes or context, (for God’s sake one of the main characters doesn’t even reciprocate the same feelings) which makes the scenes unsatisfying and coming out of nowhere. There is no longing, no real angst that make the romance scenes worth while in this anime. Kimi Ni Todoke, my aforementioned example, takes the time to show longing, reciprocation of feelings as well as showing who each of the characters are: this is what makes trivial scenes of even the characters smiling at each other enjoyable and satisfying- overall making it an effective romance medium. Bloom Into You doesn’t do this very well either. Even in supposed-to-be emotional scenes, I fail to sympathize with any of the characters, and I’m a really emotional person, so it says a lot! There is no real character in dialogue, visuals or voice acting. It feels completely bland and lifeless, a very frustrating issue because the anime is centered around our characters and their relationship with each-other. There is just genuinely no substance in dialogue either which makes it very hard to emotionally relate with the last-minute backstory. Just overall making the characters less likable and therefore the romance/ their relationships less interesting and engaging.<br />
<br />
A very important note I’d like to mention is the trend in a lot of animes that I’d like to call The Aesthetic Effect. The Aesthetic Effect is used in animes with “pretty” visuals, stories, music and concepts to be used as a facade to it’s mediocre nature. How vague the show is and the inoffensive factors of this anime make it desirable and appealing to a lot of the general audience. I think not only is this anime extremely bland, but also quite offensive at times by using lesbians as a token to justify dislikable behaviour to say the least of the main character Nanami forcefully putting herself upon the clearly uninterested Yuu. Not to be THAT person, but if a male character did things Nanami did to Yuu, it would be seen as extremely creepy. I found these scenes very unsightly and uncomfortable, which is the least thing you want for a romantic scene in a cute anime. To wrap things up, it is very clear this anime was made by people who see lesbians as an easy token key to attract audiences without adding real substance. Bloom Into You is just vague, pretty, attractive concepts jumbled into an unprofessional mess with the name of aesthetically pleasing romance. I will never understand why this anime is so overrated and put on a pedestal for being some sort of groundbreaking anime as it is just plain out boring with not really anything new to offer. Do yourself a favor and don’t watch this anime, it’s just a waste of time and it will leave you with nothing. <br />
<br />
TL;DR - boring and mediocre, uses gay tokenism to hide behind it’s flaws. <br />

    Yagate Kimi ni Naru is an anime that reminds us of the complexity of love. Several philosophers, artists, even you have tried to express that feeling to someone when you fall in love. A close person, a forgotten friend, call it what you want. Maybe someone declared us, and we did not know how to respond. Maybe we have failed, or we have managed to understand the meaning of love. No matter what happened in our life, those feelings are still present. This series uses that feeling, something that we cannot describe and creates a refreshing and pure plot that will fascinate you.<br />
<br />
On the other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297160">
        hand, some viewers may consider this series boring, absurd and ridiculous. If you do not like romance combined with slice of life, you will agree with them and this anime won&#039;t be for you.<br />
<br />
--Story--<br />
<br />
The story is straightforward, and the relationship between the different characters is exquisitely well developed. We have two girls, Yuu and Touko. The first cannot experience the feeling of love. She may know the literal meaning, but she has never &quot;loved&quot; anyone and perhaps never will. The second is a perfect student, president of the school council who cannot accept being loved. All this leads her to reject any proposal of love or avoid any relationship with someone who shows this feeling towards her. The plot develops gradually when Yuu feels the need to reject a declaration of love. Since she cannot ask for help from her friends, she decides to ask Touku, who supports her and helps her reject the declaration. For some viewers, it could be unrealistic, a cliché, I call it destiny or love at first sight, Touku begins to love Yuu. At first, we can think that it will take advantage of Yuu&#039;s condition. However, this is the beginning of an innocent relationship in which both girls will try to understand the meaning of love and about themselves. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, the plot is a combination of heart and self-definition,  slice of life and romance. The series uses school life to improve the relationship and create perfect moments where these characters can be together. In addition, it maintains simplicity and is pleasant. It does not need any strange exaggeration to ignite love like other series like Citrus with forced scenes to name one.<br />
<br />
Another interesting factor is the setting. In general, yuri romance fails because it is set in an unrealistic place where almost the entire cast is lesbian. However, in the beginning, we can appreciate a diverse group of characters that keep the plot alive and realistic. Unfortunately, the plot tends to this unrealistic configuration in some parts, and that can be seen as negative. The author avoids any social consequences, and this could be interpreted as ridiculous by some spectators. Also, that&#039;s one of my reasons for not giving the series a perfect score because it&#039;s weird and gives you the impression that something is missing. Another reason, the series has an open ending and the most relevant part of the story is in the manga, and it may not be animated (I hope I&#039;m wrong).<br />
<br />
--Characters—<br />
<br />
I like the way how the characters evolve with the relationship. The story has two main characters.<br />
<br />
Yuu Koito. She is an avid reader, cute, friendly and caring. For some reason, she cannot experience love, and she expects to learn about it with Touku. One interesting factor is the way how she can read Touku because this helps to brace the outcome. For me, she is in constant change because her doubts appear more often. Sadly, we cannot explore more of her development for that reason I invite you to read the manga.   <br />
<br />
Touko Nanami. She is a perfect girl for all the persons around her. However, she is a character full of fears and doubts. She hides that face from anyone, but Yuu can look inside her. She dislikes being loved because she hates herself, so she will reject anyone that show any affection towards her. For me, she is a very complex character but in the deep, she is the weakest one.  When she is with Yuu, she gets anxious and irradiates a beautiful feeling to the audience. <br />
<br />
--Art and Sound—<br />
<br />
The animation is good. However, there are some angles where the character lost some proportion, and they will look a bit pointed. It is weird but does not occur too often. The camera dynamic and movement are excellent, they are smooth and fit the romantic moments. It makes your eyes focus in the details of the scene. Additionally, the animation uses a bright and vivid palette that is pleasant to the eye and makes the characters glow.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack contributes with the atmosphere of the scenes and helps in the crucial moments.  The sound is elegant, soft and perfect. The OP is fantastic, and I love the rhythm and the connection with the lyrics. The ED is average, but it has a pleasant score combination.  <br />
<br />
--Enjoyment—<br />
<br />
I do not have too many negative complaints about the series. The plot is entertaining, and it arouses curiosity. The relationship between the characters is realistic, cute and pure. I love how Yuu tease her Senpai and how she reacts to that. The relationship is amusing and captivating. Sadly, the manga stills ongoing, so the series is not going to be completed. <br />
<br />
I certainly will recommend the series because it has a real emotional level with minor plot issues and acceptable pacing. However, if we compare the series with others from the same genre like Citrus or Aoi Hana, it will give you the impression that something is missing. The series is missing the charisma of a complete couple (two characters are needed in a relationship). In this show, Touku has that charisma, but Yuu lacks it because she cannot express the feeling of love and that gives the impression that the show is average or unfinished, but it is part of the plot concept. For that reason. I invite you to read the manga because you will see Yuu’s progression and changes in the source.  <br />

    Loving someone can be<br />
a slow, intimate connection. <br />
As unexpected the confession<br />
may be, hidden in discretion<br />
it must.<br />
<br />
As true to love this<br />
story may be, it&#039;s definitely slow<br />
and uneventful. Will Koito grow<br />
into bloom? I don&#039;t know --<br />
but I&#039;ll watch.<br />
<br />
Because these emotions are<br />
in all of us, waiting to grasp desperately<br />
the person we love inseparably;<br />
but we don&#039;t, because we watch worriedly:<br />
for we don&#039;t want them to go.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s true to heart, its <br />
true to soul. I care much for Koito,<br />
for Nanami, together by the rainbow,<br />
slowly sparking, the duo below<br />
to loving embrace.<br />
<br />
Bloom Into You is slowly unraveling to be a very touching, intimate and very real story of a relationship. I think

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292644">
        the best thing to consider of what exists currently is that it tones down a lot of melodrama that would generalize or dumb-down the significance of the relationship very well. The plot seems uneventful but it&#039;s time dedicated to emotionally build these characters, and that&#039;s where you really get the feel for Koito and Nanami. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a well-written, well-directed story in general, I would not hesitate to suggest this at all. It&#039;s great so far, and looking to be greater going forwards.<br />

    I expected this one to be the best and cutest lesbian romance shojo ai series from this season, but the other 2 have been much more fun to watch.<br />
<br />
The other main character here is some sort of ideal girl, student council president, getting confessed by boys (and girls) all around, super kind and polite. However, how she is presented in the series makes her just seem empty and distant. Her entire personality pretty much ends with her way of being so damn nice. <br />
<br />
The story is advanced from the POV of Yuu, our real main character, and she really isn&#039;t much better. Kohai to mrs.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292619">
        president, looking up to her like she is the real senpai. Other traits include being kinda weak and awkward at times, pondering over every little thing that happens. That&#039;s pretty much it.<br />
<br />
Dialogue has also been pretty dreadful. All they do is talk about love confessions and how to turn down boys in the most polite way possible. The way it is presented makes it seem like the girls and the story writer are so hard trying to not get anyone&#039;s feelings hurt or in any way offended that it is simply too much. It&#039;s almost disgusting. <br />
<br />
At this point, I don&#039;t really even care about what is going on with the story anymore since the characters have been such a huge letdown and uninteresting that whatever happens, it won&#039;t mean anything to me. I guess they are a good match to each others at least, considering both of them are boring and uninteresting. I will, however, say that the story surely is not making this thing any better. The pacing is just ridiculous and the romance development doesn&#039;t make any sense. It&#039;s contradicting against what our characters say and so fake / unbelievable that this thing is starting to be like air to me. If the series had managed to be good even for a second, I would claim this was an insult towards the girl love genre, but unfortunately this thing is so bland that it doesn&#039;t manage to even be that. As much as I disliked Citrus, at least the series had its moments. I conclude this series is terrible because it is making me see other shows I strongly disliked in more positive light.

    TL;DR at the bottom.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not quite sure how to say exactly what YagaKimi is to me. There&#039;s so much to say about its portrayal of a unique relationship, how it explores the concept of love and what it makes me feel to watch it as it progresses. If I had to sum it into one word YagaKimi is &#039;interesting&#039;.<br />
<br />
Story - 10<br />
The story of YagaKimi is about someone who has never fallen in love before, Yuu, having a &#039;more than friends, less than lovers&#039; kind of relationship with her senpai, Nanami and how misconceptions about love shape that relationship. It is a rather slow burn and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297162">
        you could complain about nothing really happening but, that is one of the strengths of YagaKimi, after the first episode there is a gradual build-up of emotions that slowly but surely endear you to the characters, thoroughly immerse you into their mindsets until you feel you know them better than they know themselves and never wastes a moment of time, constantly adding or expanding on details. <br />
<br />
Another strength of YagaKimi is the maturity in which it handles its themes and its refusal to have cheap drama or adhere to cliches. You never get the impression the impression that anything in this isn&#039;t genuine. Any drama that exists comes from the natural progression of events and the reasonable response given the personalities. No drama overstays its welcome and is often resolved in the episode it appears in when the characters talk about the problems. There are plenty of ways Nakatani Nio could have extended the drama infinitely or gone over the top like many of her contemporaries but, she refuses. A non-spoiler example is an indirect kiss that is only noticed by Nanami and that she only has a mild reaction to.<br />
<br />
Character - 10<br />
Romances, particularly shoujo romance, has always held a disconnect for me; an often insurmountable hurdle in the way they present love. They often present it, as Yuu perceives it should be, an overwhelming feeling of happiness just being around a person, that I never understood. This results in the anime having to convince me that this feeling is genuine.<br />
<br />
YagaKimi overcomes this hurdle by having its main character being in that same situation of longing for that feeling but not being able to grasp it that makes for an instantly relatable character that you get invested in growing as a person as the story goes on.<br />
<br />
Nanami, on the other hand, becomes one of the most emotionally complex characters in romance anime and seeing her various layers peeled back and explored is truly where my &#039;interest&#039; in YagaKimi stems from. <br />
<br />
My personal stance on side characters is too ignore them until they&#039;re relevant and let them not waste space or make them interesting. YagaKimi follows the former, the side characters are interesting enough that I&#039;m not bored during the short time that they&#039;re the focus while adding little bits of detail to the overall message of the story. Though none of them really stand out.<br />
<br />
Art - 9<br />
YagaKimi was a decently drawn manga with a penchant for symbolism, visual storytelling and interesting composition. The anime has managed to bring some of the less expressive parts of the manga to life and has so far translated the panels beautifully into animation. Troyca has done an outstanding job with the visuals, making the best looking anime this season. Although other anime is technically better looking, YagaKimi uses its visuals in the best way.<br />
<br />
Sound - 9<br />
Every piece of music used compliments the scene that it plays under as music should, though nothing about the OST stands out. The OP and ED aren&#039;t to my taste, but neither is most Japanese music I&#039;ve listened to so I can&#039;t judge them fairly.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is on point, perfectly representing the characters and really selling their emotions.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10<br />
As you can probably tell, I really enjoyed YagaKimi. It is definitely the best shoujo-ai I&#039;ve seen and among the best romances I&#039;ve read (all my other favourite romances haven&#039;t been adopted yet). The way all the points mentioned above work together to create an anime that I can only call a masterpiece. Watching the anime has made me notice lots of subtle details I missed in the manga, causing me to re-read and gain a better appreciation for it and rewatching the episodes has been rewarding in all the extra subtleties that animation can give.<br />
<br />
Overall- 10<br />
YagaKimi is an interesting take on an interesting relationship dynamic with mature handling of its themes and a refusal to add cheap melodrama or cliches. It has relatable and emotionally complex characters that are voiced well and animated beautifully. The soundtrack adds to the experience without standing out and the visual storytelling is the best this season. It is definitely worth a watch.<br />

    Like a delicate flower, Bloom Into You acts upon its namesake, as the seed of the slept-on dark horse blossoms into one of the most charming shows to blindside me this year. I’m glad, for had I not stumbled upon the glowing reception for this treat, it may have never swept me off my feet. From its mostly charming depictions of lesbian love to its authentic showcasing of friendship, each interaction is filled to the brim with charm and care. Said charm and care also show in a majority of the revelations which make this surprisingly relatable and whimsical cast come to life even more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297179">
        than one could imagine. The revelation for Maki and subplot for Koyomi might be my personal favorites of the show, each bolstering integral portions of the show’s three overarching plotlines. Seeing them intertwine, how each colorful character bounces off them, and how Yuu evolves from them, is simply heartwarming. This show may be repetitive and melodramatic in places, but the monologues and forced wind blowing aren’t enough to smear the beauty on display here.<br />
<br />
Speaking of display, Makoto Katou’s directing is a major selling point. While it occasionally feels forced like with the focus on scenery in emotional moments, we more often get the most luscious visualizations of each characters’ headspace, along with some mesmerizing and communicative shots that can be hung on a wall. These are the scenes where Makoto and his team at TROYCA shine. <br />
<br />
Adding onto the visual splendor of this show, the lovely art style and facial expressions translated from the manga do well to accentuate the tender yet lively nature of the characters and their interactions. The fashionable school uniforms and other equally elegant wardrobes only compliment this even further, and the female uniforms look particularly wonderful. While there are certainly flat moments and sparse bits of unsightly CGI, the show rarely fails to remain as pretty as its females.<br />
<br />
To add to this beauty one last time, there’s the delicate OST Michiru Oshima composed. Several of the emotional tracks do well to complement each scene, adding to the heartfelt and loving nature of the show. My personal favorite example of this is the insert track from episode 9: “Rise” by Riko Azuna, as it is one of my favorite insert tracks of the year. Nothing embodies the pleasant nature of the show more than this one track, not even the fun ending theme by the main leads’ VAs, or the opening theme by the same artist. &quot;Hectopascal” and &quot;Kimi ni Furete” respectively make for good songs in their own right despite the questionable techno in the former and the questionable vocals in the latter, so there’s nary an issue to be had, even here.<br />
<br />
If there’s a word that encapsulates this delicate beauty, it would be “endearing”. The banter and interactions feel so authentic and lifelike that amidst the lampooning and exhibition of shoujo tropes lies a surprisingly wholesome and equally elegant tale of lesbian romance. For every moment of repetitious interactions and monologue, there’s an impactful revelation, beautiful interaction, or heartwarming moment to counterbalance. There may be lulls and missteps, but this beauty has enough elegance and charm for me to brush that all aside. She’s wonderful, ain’t she?<br />

    I&#039;m absolutely perplexed and bewildered by the general consensus on this anime, so I would like to provide my two cents, because there&#039;s not a single review I can agree with.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art/Sound:<br />
Let&#039;s get the subjective criteria out of the way first. Art is good, character designs are pleasant to look at, and backgrounds are of high quality aswell. As for the soundtrack, the piano compositions that play at certain scenes are very nice, however I can&#039;t say the same about neither OP nor ED, I disliked them both, I&#039;m not going to say that they are bad or anything such, it&#039;s just not the kind of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297333">
        music I enjoy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters/Plot:<br />
The juicy part. What unfolds in this show is a dysfunctional relationship between a person that&#039;s mentally disturbed (Touko) and a person that&#039;s flawed on the fundamental level, because she is incapable of feeling love and empathy (Yuu). People claim they see a very mellow and realistic relationship between two girls, but I personally fail to see that.<br />
<br />
 There&#039;s a lot of opinions that Touko has a genuine affection towards Yuu, but I think that people are mistaking an indulgence for affection. How can you feel genuine affection and love for someone, if you are incapable of loving yourself? She even states outright that she doesn&#039;t want Yuu to love or hate her back, and only wants to indulge herself in Yuu&#039;s kindness, as that puts her distressed self at ease, a dubious concept at best, since how can a person to whom love and empathy are alien, unknown emotions, can be kind, is beyond me. <br />
Touko also quite frequently acts in a mentally disturbed and creepy manner, looking at her family photo and reassuring herself that she&#039;ll be exactly as her sister was in her eyes. Because, apparently, if you&#039;re a shy and meek child, instead of self-betterment, a much superior choice would be to become a literal copy of your older sister, and then grapple with mental and stress repercussions of your decisions. Not to mention that she low-key contemplates suicide a couple times, once at the crosswalk at the train tracks, and another in the final episode, where she&#039;s standing at the train station paltform and takes a step forward, while the train is about to pass the afformentioned station.<br />
As I stated earlier, Yuu is flawed on a fundamental level, since she cannot feel love and empathy, yet somehow renowned for her kindness, sure, whatever. In the relationship with Touko, to me personally, she comes off as a Stockholm Syndrom victim, because I cannot sum up a person that puts up with someone who indulges themselves in her, forces her to kiss them, even though she&#039;s clearly not in a mood for it, explicitly tells her to not have an affection of any kind towards them, in any other way. The only solace, is that at the end of final episode she&#039;s finally had enough of it, as she says: &quot;It&#039;s time for us to change trains, senpai&quot;.<br />
The rest of cast is inconsequential, as they usually have about 5 minutes of screen time, over 12 episodes, total, or are there to fulfill a single role. The only one I will mention, is Maki-kun, a creepy self-admitted voyer, who doesn&#039;t want to be in any relationship himself, but rather be a spectator to the relationships of others, that he finds interesting/intriguing.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Personally, I&#039;m revolted by relationship of this kind, I won&#039;t elaborate on it here further, as if you&#039;re reading this, it&#039;s clear as to why I&#039;m displeased. There&#039;s nothing else I can add to this. When autumn chart was just released, I dismissed this anime, as I assumed that it will be like just about anything with similiar tags, only to be asked by my friend to join him, cause he saw potential. Now that it ended, he&#039;s dissapointed in it, though not as much as I am.

    Do not watch this as romance.<br />
Do not watch this as yuri.<br />
Do not expect easily likeable characters.<br />
<br />
This is a very deep psychological essay about universal questions.<br />
What we love when we love? Will the love die when the loved one changes?<br />
What defines us, our decisions? Is there such a thing as free will?<br />
<br />
This is a story about two persons with their issues forming a dysfunctional relationship but somehow (and this part is not in this season, it is meant for season 2) finding joy, through joy finding love, and moving (partially) to the light.<br />
<br />
If you are into psychology, if you can read classics like Dickens, Dostoevsky and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363610">
        Chekhov without frowning, then you will thoroughly enjoy this story. <br />
<br />
This anime is not a complete story, it completes half of the manga. The characters just starting to realize how deep they have their heads in their butts.<br />
<br />
Yuu is a lonely girl who wants to find love but doesn&#039;t actually understand what it should look like, chasing unrealistic fantasies. She often does something because she wants to help, not because she wants something for herself. She is hardworking, ethical and sticks to the rules (sometimes self-imposed). She is very calm and does not get excited easily.<br />
<br />
Touko is a lonely girl with identity problems.<br />
She doesn&#039;t understand who she is and who she should be, hiding behind masks.<br />
She is afraid to be loved because she thinks that if she is loved as she is today, she must not change. <br />
<br />
Touko sees kind and ethical but disconnected Yuu as an ideal partner that will forgive her, save her and do not put any expectations because she will not “love” her.. <br />
Yuu sees impulsive and sometimes egotistical Touko as an ideal partner who doesn’t require her to “love”. Also as somebody who can teach her to be more excited (and feel love finally) and as somebody she can save. <br />
<br />
The whole manga is slowly progressing over a year&#039;s story with many back and forth where the characters help each other to do their therapeutic work and find insight into their flaws, discard their fantasies and learn to love.<br />
<br />
This anime is extremely close to manga, feeling up to maybe 1% of the gaps and rearranging about 3 scenes for better flow.<br />
What is different: Touko is made even more creepy and bird-like with how she is taking pauses to stare with her face frozen. This makes Touko even mode unlikable from the beginning but contributes for slightly better development when she becomes more thawed by the unconditional kindness of Yuu.<br />
<br />
BTW, there is nothing &quot;asexual&quot; in Yuu. She tells us many times that this is not so. She is interested, it feels good, she wants to touch Touko on many occasions, and so on. Only her ethics, combined with Touko&#039;s deep fear to go too far, keep her from going forward.<br />
Neither she is &quot;unable to love&quot;. She is Mother Theresa and Jesus Christ. She just doesn&#039;t understand what love is and this is a cornerstone of her development.<br />
<br />

    Let&#039;s keep this review brief and to the point:<br />
<br />
Art/Sound:<br />
This anime has a very beautiful art style with some solid animation, in addition the music is placed well in key moments as well as both the OP and ED being beautiful<br />
<br />
Characters/Plot:<br />
The plot is simplistic and very basic, however it&#039;s executed very well and the characters are all likeable and feel realistic. Also, I love how the shoujo ai/yuri romance is portrayed; covering most of their emotions rather than lust as in other shows of this Genre.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
The anime is all-round solid and I&#039;ve enjoyed the majority of my time watching it; there could be some tweaks made

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292654">
        here and there but all in all, it&#039;s an enjoyable experience for any shoujo ai or romance fans!

    A yuri series custom-made to appeal to homophobes and perpetuate homophobic/misogynistic stereotypes.<br />
<br />
Hunter x Hunter is a long-running Weekly Shonen Jump manga famous for its endless hiatuses. It has a reputation of being a “smart” battle shounen. And the reason it allegedly is smart is that it over-explains in excruciating detail every. Single. Damn. Pointless. Minute. Thing. Which, of course, makes it the exact opposite of smart. Smart stories treat their audience as capable of understanding subtext, implications, and visual storytelling without the need to be spoon-fed everything. But at least HxH can be excused for spoonfeeding the workings of a complicated shounen magic system. <br />
What

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418789">
        HxH does with magic, YagaKimi does with basic human social interactions, and the result is pure, unadulterated cringe.<br />
Like, here’s one of the first dialogues that happen in the show:<br />
- Will you please go out with me?<br />
- I’m sorry, I won’t go out with you.<br />
- I see. It makes sense that we can’t be a couple if we’re not suited for each other.<br />
- Don’t worry, someone else will be suited for you. <br />
These are the actual dialogue lines straight from subtitles. I’m baffled how a human person could write dialogue this unnatural. The only explanation is that whoever wrote these hasn’t ever talked to another human being in their entire life. Possibly because they are an alien wearing a skin of a person like that cockroach from Men in Black. Or they just really, really, really suck at writing.<br />
That’s not an isolated example, this series basically has no real dialogue, every single “dialogue” line is exposition on what everyone is thinking, feeling, and doing at the moment, intended to be spoonfeeding for some weirdo aliens that haven’t ever seen humans before.<br />
<br />
Every other aspect of the series’ writing is equally abysmal.<br />
Characters:<br />
One of the main characters is Yuu. Her personality is that she has Madoka-colored hair and has big gay.<br />
Another main character is Touko. Her personality is that she has Homura-colored hair and has big gay. <br />
And the story is that they have big gay together. That’s it. If writing here was less braindead, I would accuse the series of tokenism - using “gay” characters for some cheap pandering without bothering to give them any personality beyond the fact that they are gay. But no, it’s not that this alien cockroach can’t write gay people, they just can’t write people, period. An average Homura x Madoka doujinshi has better characterization.<br />
Story:<br />
There is none. This series is tagged as romance - it isn’t that. Romance is people interacting and developing feelings for each other based on how their personalities match (aka romantic chemistry). You can’t have chemistry between two planks of wood. You can’t say that “this character likes this character because they are A, B, C…” when the character in question is empty nothing with no personality traits. The entire foundation of the leads’ “relationship” is that they are often in the same room (because the plot puts them there).<br />
<br />
And now, regarding homophobia/misogyny. This is a bit complex, so I have to establish two points before reaching the conclusion.<br />
One:<br />
There is this interview with Hosoda Mamoru about his movie Bell where he talks about how the anime industry has a huge problem with shallow idealized waifubait characters that do not resemble living, breathing women in any way, and exist only to provide fetish appeal to audiences that unironically use the term 3DPD. And, although not saying the name, he puts the blame for this state of affairs on Miyazaki, as he is the one who has popularized and cemented this type of characters with his movies. Personally, I would go further, I’d say that the reason Miyazaki’s films fetishize youth, innocence, purity, and niceness is that Miyazaki is a pedophile - he said on record “What’s wrong with falling in love with a 12-year-old girl?” and on another occasion said that the whole reason he got into making anime was the 1958 film Hakujaden, or rather, the prototypical actually-1000-years-old-loli Bai Niang, whom he treated as a surrogate girlfriend when he was 17. But I digress, for now just put a pin into the “pure waifu” idea.<br />
Two:<br />
Lesbians in Japan have a political self-identification term, “gachi lezz,” which translates into something like “dead-serious lesbo.” What’s political about being dead-serious? Well, you see, Japan has a long-standing stereotype that yuri romance is a phase that giggling, blushing high school girls go through in order to “rehearse” relationships in a safe environment until they are ready for “real” relationships with men. And if someone is still into girls past high school, they are stunted, infantile, and probably not right in the head. Which makes being a dead-serious lesbo a political statement - no, we’re conscious, mature women that prefer to have sex with other women.<br />
Anime and other otaku-pandering media contribute to this stereotype immensely. The so-called yuri anime fits into the framework of Miyazaki’s idealized waifus cum surrogate girlfriends perfectly. According to otaku logic, sex between girls is not real sex, and naturally, yuri waifus don’t have relationships with men either, which makes them ideal virgins that save themselves for the viewer. But you need your yuri waifus to actually act “nice” and “pure” for that to sell. Any attempts by the medium to portray lesbians realistically are met with rabid, psychotic hatred. A good example of that is Citrus - a blatantly gachi lezz series (anyone who has ever talked to a lesbian irl can tell that the author is one and that she used her personal experiences for the story), which attracted an insane amount of vitriol, badmouthing, and false-narrative pushing - and now you know why (you can read the top reviews of its anime adaptation for more details on that subject).<br />
<br />
I hope you can already tell where I was going with all of that. YagaKimi is everything wrong with this yuri-anime-for-incels genre distilled into a single package. If there is one trait that its protagonists have beyond hair color, it’s being nice and pure. They never want to upset anyone, they’re never mad at anyone, they never masturbate fantasizing about a hot female celebrity - they are not people. Because they are not meant to be people, but surrogate girlfriends for the target audience. Again, I don’t even think this was done intentionally - just criminal incompetence on the writer’s part. Except evil done out of sheer stupidity is still evil.<br />
<br />
1/10 for incompetent and immoral filth.   <br />

    Bloom Into You is an embodiment of pleasantness, constructing a wholesome narrative about finding oneself and what lies ahead. This series is best described as a slice-of-life with romance as a primary narrative. While the setting is somewhat like Citrus in terms of character archetypes, Bloom Into You approaches storytelling much differently than most romance stories. The show is far less about dramatic tension between the characters, and instead focuses on evaluating their relationships with one another, whether it’s affection, ambivalence, admiration, or animosity. The story takes form as a series of conventional moments and activities in which characters interact with one another in a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297191">
        practical, level-headed manner. Bloom Into You has a notorious aptitude for presenting these characters in such a way in which they are acting upon their own accord, rather than bending to the will of the narrative. The daily life of Yuu Koito is followed by us as we witness the changes in her everyday routine as well as her own views, watching everything blossom and mature as nature takes its course.<br />
<br />
The melancholic tone that pervades much of Bloom Into You comes from conflicts within the characters’ own selves, but rarely between characters. Yuu struggles to feel love and ponders about her future, Touko is lonesome and fixated on her duties, and Sayaka is jealous and keeps her feelings bottled within her. These are character arcs that rarely end up in dramatic confrontations, and rather are pursued by their own accord. The cast maintains a positive rapport throughout much of the story, largely shielded from dramatic complications that would negatively affect their relationships. Hostility between characters either occurs very rarely or is short-lived. Viewers who want to steer clear of serious drama will feel right at home with Bloom Into You. But those looking for drama will be somewhat dissatisfied by this aspect.<br />
<br />
Even as someone who has a strong bias for dramatic, emotionally driven narratives such as Octave, Citrus, and Aoi Hana, all of which are about lesbian romance as well, I can certainly say Bloom Into You has plenty going for it either way. The characters have just enough personality to give life to these situations. They emote, interject, pout, and elicit various other responses true to their character. Even the most mundane of character interactions feel very alive, and due to how likeable everyone is, this really emulates the pleasure of genuine socialization between good friends. The plot itself is largely unaffected by anyone other than Touko, and the cast succumbs to this as they wind up in various moments of recreation, discourse, and determination. In a way, the plot is the cast itself.<br />
<br />
Yuu is an endearing character to follow in how her internal feelings slowly mature and develop as she interacts more with Touko and ponders over her feelings about her. Her attitude ranges from curious, to longing, to content, to frustrated. Her development, as with everything else in Bloom Into You, is taken slowly, but is done with nuance and purpose.<br />
<br />
Touko is unfortunately a less engaging character, and dare I say Bloom Into You’s biggest missed opportunity. Her conflict is very sensical, but her background isn’t expounded enough to really make her dilemma feel genuine. Conceptually, she is a sympathetic character. Making decisions that only affect how people see you with no benefit to the self is unhealthy, and Yuu is both wise and respectable in trying to draw somebody away from this line of thinking. So this works well on paper, but Bloom Into You doesn’t fully commit to this. Touko doesn’t appear to be suffering nearly as much as the story wants us to believe. A person with low self-esteem shows symptoms, such as social withdrawal, hostility, and sensitivity to criticism,, hardly any of which is apparent with Touko.<br />
<br />
Her one quality that&#039;s consistent with self-hatred is putting up a facade to impress others and consequently, her attraction to Yuu, who holds nothing against the true self which Touko hides from everyone else. But even then, the difference between these two versions of Touko is almost negligible. Being timid and somewhat pushy are really the only traits of her that we see that aren’t of the ‘perfect’ self she puts on around others. Additionally, we hardly ever see her truly distressed about her whole charade, or just how negatively it affects her. Any sort of behavior she displays around Yuu, apart from her romantic attraction, isn’t symptomatic of being under pressure or constant stress, which are logical effects on someone in her situation.<br />
<br />
Funnily enough, this is actually commonly declared to be where Bloom Into You succeeds Citrus, which is odd to me since Citrus was far more successful in depicting a mentally broken love interest, by which I mean Mei Aihara. Mei is a truly broken individual, and the story accentuated this by having her act unfavorably in many situations. These scenes were off-putting to many viewers, but you should expect nothing less with this kind of character. Rather than telling us constantly about how broken and misguided she is, Citrus instead showed us what years of neglect and abuse have on someone, to where Mei can truly be believed as the character she was written to be. We’re shown how she doesn’t value her own body and has a horribly distorted perception of relationships.<br />
<br />
The characterization of Touko is extremely tame in comparison. When I hear a specific quote from Yuu along the lines of “Touko has so many flaws I don’t even know where to begin,” all I can think is “What flaws?” At most, she’s pushy around Yuu and tends to lean on her during emotional hangups. These traits alone aren’t characteristic of a broken person. Bloom Into You teases you constantly about what Touko is really like without her perfect persona, and the most it can offer is having Touko telling the audience about her conflict and history. This isn’t enough because human beings aren’t that simple. If Touko really is suffering so much, why not show how this affects her general behavior and interactions, rather than the constant “I hate myself” or “I love you because you expect nothing of me”?<br />
<br />
There’s a pretty obvious answer to the question above: it’s because Touko needs to be likeable. Likeable she is, however, it’s hard to get invested in her plight because her character is so artificial. If Touko’s character was explored better, I’d have a reason to believe that she truly is damaging herself or Yuu with her mentality or by trying to become her sister. Her personality would be more than just lip service to the audience and comedic blushes around Yuu.<br />
<br />
As much as I praise the character of Mei Aihara, I can admit that this sort of approach isn’t for everyone, and there’s certainly a mindset encouraged to take in this story. Mei’s terrible communication skills can be onerous and frustrating to viewers, which is a sentiment I can understand. Theoretically, a heavily flawed love interest with such a troubled background can offer an appeal of her own if not taken to the same extreme as that of Mei; someone like Mei but more morally grounded and accountable to make a love story that is wholesome yet emphasizes the dysfunction and grit we love to see in our messy romance tales.<br />
<br />
Touko Nanami as a character has the potential of striking that perfect balance, a reconciliation of Mei’s toxicity with the dramatic overlay that Touko offers in her own dialogue. Bloom Into You was Nakatani Nio’s first attempt at writing a story outside of a Touhou doujin, so you can’t expect everything to go perfectly. But apparently, she was so passionate in writing Touko’s character to where she was originally the main character of Bloom Into You until that role was taken by Yuu.<br />
<br />
If the character of Touko falls short, then the romantic pairing is less captivating as a result. That said, Yuu and Touko have interactions that are comedic and charming, with Touko being pushy at times while timid at others, and Yuu being cheeky and somewhat playful, as well as being occasionally snide in response to Touko’s mannerisms.<br />
<br />
Even if Touko isn’t as emotionally captivating as I’d like her to be, the nature of the relationship between her and Yuu is what sells the experience. The time they spent with each other is sublime,  The dynamic between them makes for what I consider the best character moments in the entire series. Their interactions can be comedic, heartfelt, or introspective, and deliver in all these. Furthermore, that one exchange between them in episode 6 might as well be a series highlight, and those who have watched the show will know exactly what I’m talking about.<br />
<br />
This pairing also has a depressing nature to it, thanks to Touko’s pessimistic view of love. Touko has essentially shackled Yuu into remaining in a state where if she were to develop romantic feelings for Touko, then Touko would no longer want to be in this relationship. It’s especially disheartening to see a character you really like confined in such a way out of her own volition, with the feeling that she may never live the dream she wanted for so long.<br />
<br />
As worthwhile as all these characters generally are to watch, Bloom Into You really doesn’t have all that much going for it in the way of depth. The character exploration is there, and the themes about love are quite engaging, but with the exception of Yuu, the personalities aren’t exactly complex, as they’re quite limited in traits. I honestly struggle to describe any character of Bloom Into You with more than a paragraph. The fact the Bloom Into You will outright explain things that are already implied, draining the narrative of its subtlety, certainly doesn&#039;t help matters either.<br />
<br />
Yuu’s inner thoughts are strongly comprised of fanciful metaphors which, while they may effectively portray her immature, derivative line of thinking, it makes her conflict feel less involving. With that said, these sort of scene-by-scene diary entries effectively sells the mood as we vicariously experience these events flow one after another and the significance they hold.<br />
<br />
These monologues are the main drive in which Bloom Into You sells the experience, as the dialogue in Bloom Into You is unfortunately lacking in the way of a character drama. Much of the value comes from the meaning and implication of the dialogue, not so much the dialogue itself. For example, Yuu and Touko’s first couple of days as a pairing demonstrate the lack of emotional correspondence between the two, signifying the fruitlessness in Yuu’s acceptance to go out with Touko hoping to acquire that feeling of love she’s longed for. While this is all fine and good, and is well in line with Yuu’s character arc, I have little desire to ever revisit those several scenes because the emotional connection is so meager.<br />
<br />
Sayaka herself encapsulates this priority in making a statement rather than making the most out of character investment. On one hand, it’s commendable how Sayaka’s character arc emulates the hurdles of an LGBT making their way through a conservative society, with her own subtle homophobia and dilemma in whether to believe her sexuality as something genuine or the adolescent phase it’s sadly viewed to be. However, when taking out the context of this liberation, Sayaka’s overall character leaves much to be desired. Apart from her dialogue with Miyako, and the liberating feeling one is bound to have with this long-awaited progressive attitude towards LGBT, this arc sadly doesn’t offer much in the way of character investment. Take away this true-to-life struggle, and what’s left is an unfortunately bland character.<br />
<br />
After watching Citrus, which had lively interactions between characters with great emotional dynamics, Bloom Into You feels like a huge step down. Even Yuu, who I consider the most engaging character in Bloom Into You, shockingly pales when compared to Citrus’ protagonist Yuzu who has far more personality, often acting reckless yet possessing a sharp mind when feeling the need to, as well as having layers as a character. Arguably, Citrus’ biggest weakness was its overall plot, relying too much on contrivances coupled with a breakneck pace which makes plot points less impactful than they should be. But what Citrus has in place of its somewhat messy plot is highly endearing characters and interactions that don&#039;t rely on incessant monologues and soliloquies to be engaging. Bloom Into You is the exact opposite case, with a solid narrative and a more authentic series of events. Yet the characters and their interactions are what’s lacking in comparison. With both series having different strengths and weaknesses, I suppose it’s up to debate as to which is better. However when it comes to a character drama, I’m sure as hell more in favor with better characters.<br />
<br />
What makes the experience so worthwhile is watching these personalities cross roads with one another. The characters of Bloom Into You are not what I would call complex or even deep, but their development and general traits are woven into the narrative with such nuance and at a steady pace to where it feels authentic and wholesome. Each personality is a piece of a larger whole, working like organisms in an ecosystem giving function to a wholly pleasant and mesmerizing experience. Coupling this with the serene presentation and sensitive, nuanced animation sells the splendor all the more.<br />
<br />
This adaptation of Bloom Into You has effectively displayed what TROYCA is capable of, with lovingly rendered backgrounds and moving color direction to effectively frame the events that transpire. Lush flora and vegetation is detailed in its texturing and accentuated with the shot composition, emphasizing the theme of nature by enveloping scenes in a breathing, changing wilderness. TROYCA has crafted a product in which art and technology work in harmony bringing the presentation to a commendable level in every regard.<br />
<br />
...Or so they would have, if not for many of the hamfisted and borderline infantile choices in directing.<br />
<br />
For some reason, in episode 4, it’s essential that a black, blotchy effect with a raucous splatting sound is put within a showing of Yuu’s apprehension of what would happen to Touko’s reputation. The first episode also decides to disrupt the soft and somewhat mellow tone in the classroom by evoking Yuu’s feeling of indifference with a visual of water gushing into the room and submerging her, then displaying her to be located far away from her deskmates.<br />
<br />
Let’s also consider the scene right after Touko apologizes for her...mishap, let’s say. Transition is made with a well-composed shot of Touko and Yuu walking in opposite directions with a pillar in between them, in an environment of subdued greens, yellows, teals, and dark greys effectively contrasting with the previous scene. Yuu then makes her way outside, thinking about why she felt nothing when she was kissed by Touko. In order to emphasize her feeling disappointed and forlorn, there’s plenty of ways the environment could have been used to pull it off. Maybe she stands in a shaded area. Maybe a cloud passes over the sun and obstructs the light everywhere around her. Maybe she stands in front of a grey stone wall with nature out of sight in the shot. So what does Bloom Into You end up doing?<br />
<br />
It instead puts her in a shot with color removed completely, over an abstract background with no resemblance to the tangible location she was in previously. This amateurish technique is used once again in that same episode during a group photo, where Yuu holds Touko’s hand hoping to finally get “that feeling,” as the color inexplicably fades out. This is then followed by flashbacks with an obnoxious film scratch overlay and the end of each to convey the point even further.<br />
<br />
Bloom Into You’s presentation is at its best when it isn’t so artificial, with episode 6 being a standout example. Shots are framed naturally to convey distance and relation with scenery, with no abstract, artificial filters or effects to disrupt the harmony. Water is again used as a motif, but in a manner that is much more subtle and respects the attention of the viewer. All of this combined with gratifying music and strong voice acting makes for an exceptionally memorable scene.<br />
<br />
Utilizing natural assets from the scene to create a more authentic mood is not only a great fit for the theme of nature, it’s also good practice in general. The use of warm light which glares through the window to evoke intensity between our main leads is also well in line with this practice, even if its contrivance makes it less than ideal. Dare I make yet another comparison to Citrus, which almost never enters the same directing pitfalls Bloom Into You does on occasion. Takeo Takashi made sure to always ground situations, how theatrical they may be on their own, in authentic, non-abstract environments where natural symbolism and character acting take precedence, with camerawork and editing on par with even some of Bloom Into You&#039;s most impressive scenes. Let&#039;s also not forget about the trip to Kyoto which, even at its more intense moments, retains the sort of natural atmosphere Bloom Into You is notorious of.<br />
<br />
A prominent virtue of reading fiction is the idea that someone else&#039;s mind is being delved into; peering into an author&#039;s own philosophies and worldview depicted as a narrative. Nakatani&#039;s Nio&#039;s Bloom Into You is an elaborate culmination of ideas that are awe-inspiring and take form in captivating ways, yet is seemingly shy of taking more daring approaches with its narrative. Nio seems more keen on expressing her own ideas and self than anchoring them to a more austere, grounded, double-sided reality that said ideas would realistically come with. This mentality was shared with and carried by the production team in the making of this adaptation, for better or worse.<br />
<br />
Our world is certainly not a completely grim, harrowing, cesspool as reflected by some self-indulgent writers out there, but it&#039;s not quite as amiable as Bloom Into You seems to imply. People like Touko generally have more layers to their personality that are more unpleasant than we see here. People like Sayaka usually aren&#039;t as easygoing or quick to forgive. And don&#039;t count on your luck to have someone learning your secrets to be as good-natured as Maki. Now, a more pleasant version of life is always welcome in the realm of fiction. However, Nakatani Nio&#039;s choice to implement more cerebral themes into a high school drama, and a lack of commitment to this direction, leaves the end product feeling dishonest and overly safe.<br />
<br />
Bland characters and gauche directing aside, Bloom Into You displays illustrious writing skill accompanied with equally eye-catching presentation. Everything falls into place creating an experience unlikely to be forgotten by me or anyone else in search of a very solid and wholesome romance story between girls and a tale of self-realization. It’s sure to offer something special to those who have been in a place similar to that of Yuu, and its ideas are sure to enthrall those itching for out-of-body experiences through a solemn, angst-driven romance.

    My first Yuri Anime was Citrus.<br />
Bloom into you is nothing like Citrus, and focuses on a complex relationship. It handles the relationship development in quite a mature way, which is pretty good.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
I find it hard to tell, if it is a Yuri-Anime or not, since the girls do not fall into a explicit category of lesbian or anything. They harbour a complex identity, with one afraid of falling in love and other cannot love anyone.<br />
<br />
The other one (Yuu) feels like she identifies herself as asexual, though can&#039;t say uptill Ep 7.<br />
<br />
The way their relation is handled is quite well, but requires a certain maturity to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294202">
        understand whats going on. Hence, I won&#039;t recommend it to any person who doesn&#039;t have that maturity to respect what&#039;s going on here.<br />
<br />
Art : Beautiful.<br />
OP : It has an eerie vibe associated to it. Never knew flowers could have an eerie feel associated with them. It&#039;s just fantastic<br />
<br />
Also the small references, like the Ice-Cream Tear, and the two droplets of coffee separating apart (Ep 7) throws a light into the small details crafted by the animators and director.<br />
<br />
Sound : OP/ED is again pretty good. Song added to playlist.<br />
<br />
Overall : 10 / 10<br />
<br />
It is better than Citrus like anime, and handles a delicate relationship very well. (atleast up till Ep 7)<br />
Looking forward for the rest of the Anime.<br />
<br />
Cheer<br />

    The Shoujo Ai genre has seen it&#039;s fair share of ups and downs, and has been a letdown in recent times (We&#039;re looking at you Citrus), so when this show dropped in this season, I was very flawed at how I understood the taboo that is the Shoujo Ai aspect, but yet this show managed to do an outstanding justice to the genre, and (at this time) is one of (if not the best) shows due to its maturity and how it defines and breaks the convention that has been done before (e.g. moe-fied Yuru Yuri series) and teaches a whole new lesson altogether.<br />
<br />
Yagate Kimi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297167">
        ni Naru, or Bloom Into You, tells the story of Yuu Koito and Touko Nanami, two individuals clasping for love in the most unusual way. Yuu, having grown up and loves reading shoujo manga, she feels the slightest (if not none) feeling of confessions from the opposite sex. Enter the high school age, and the other party (Touko) also gets the same treatment as Yuu, and immediately rejects the exact same feelings without hesitation. Having never both fallen in (true) love before, the tale of how Yuu and Touko manages to control and share their desires for each other; clear up misunderstands and all that stuff; is an entirely new territory to them. Although the lovey-dovey moments are a slow-but-painful process, the ever-folding drama is what makes the process special not just for the main duo, but the supporting cast as well (which is the Student Council), helping both Yuu and Touko in accidental taboo moments (Maki discovering that Yuu is in love with Touko, while the Sayaka-Touko-Yuu love triangle is present (but thankfully not told) and isn&#039;t the crux and problem (unlike Citrus)), discovering what&#039;s best and how to support each other. Not to mention that Saeki Sayaka, having come off from the same girls&#039; school as Touko, has the same rivaled feelings when Touko always gives special attention to Yuu, so much that she doesn&#039;t let go, but understands her troubles and whatnot, really giving the edge to understand and not to conquer, that&#039;s a very bold decision to further drive her character into holding Touko close to her heart but not wanting to impede on her path.<br />
<br />
Above all, everything about this series is so well done, the writing doesn&#039;t feel tacked on and it&#039;s mostly ingenious genuity that really pushes every character (be it main or supporting) into simple or complex conflict that raises doubts and questions about each other&#039;s true intentions and whatnot. Brilliant work to the writing staff.<br />
<br />
TROYCA&#039;s art and animation is simply unrivaled. Although it is a detracting from their usual work (the Re:Creators style), they don&#039;t stop there. The beautiful art and the gripping animation are both works of wonder to draw people into the world that is both sightseeing and emotional-driving, that once you try to take your sights away even for just a moment, you&#039;re missing out on something special. Another brilliance of a work here to capture the gaze of the audience, and I have to say, this is a special moment in the world where imagination works wonders.<br />
<br />
Even more brilliant, is the sweet dope-fresh music. Most particularly, Michiru Oshima&#039;s composure of music. The beautiful, fantastic OP by Riko Azuna is really the icing on the cake, one to listen to on repeat, as is with the beautiful and subtle emotional tellings of the trio (Yuu, Touko and Sayaka) as they attempt to mask their true feelings for one another through the lush artwork present and the timely animations that just intensify the emotions all of us have to go through, even in forbidden land. The sweet ED by the main duo Yuu and Touko is OK at best, but not one to slouch either, as they try to walk the fine line through the relationship that has already been established.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s about time we get an absolute masterpiece of the Shoujo Ai genre, and we have reached the pinnacle (or is it?). This is a show not to be skipped, even if the Shoujo Ai tag brings displeasure or disdain to your romance list.

    I dropped this show because I stopped believing maybe there&#039;s something interesting that I&#039;m missing and is coming up. It was pretty hollow and empty.<br />
<br />
From what I can see, people who like this show are people who looked for lighthearted entertainment. I looked for an interesting story that would teach me to understand something I didn&#039;t understand before, or share insights to things I didn&#039;t feel/think of before, but I found none here. This doesn&#039;t mean it has to be incredibley psychological - I found that in Idolish7 or Anohana for example. This one doesn&#039;t match to them.<br />
<br />
There are pretty irregular personalities and relationships here

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295089">
        I suppose, which is good, but I don&#039;t think we had a chance to understand them in any deep level - I feel like we&#039;re only shown these on a surface level, their actions don&#039;t make sense to me. We don&#039;t see why is the connection like it is and where does each character feel like they stand, we just get a couple of dry reasons so we&#039;re like (making up an example not from this story) &quot;uh huh so she&#039;s crying because she was abandoned as a child&quot;, they don&#039;t feel like something I&#039;d encounter so I would understand it on my own with no need for the anime to show me how it feels, and they also don&#039;t get explored a little and I don&#039;t see stuff that would help me get a grasp of what these reasons feel like. It&#039;s dry, you&#039;re getting information but you finish an episode and you don&#039;t feel an emotional impact because surface level drama that does&#039;t make that much sense to you is all you saw. I don&#039;t come to understand why a character acts this way, why a character feels this way, I just come to generally know the listed reason the author told me earlier and enjoy the ride.<br />
<br />
Now, you might think maybe it was shown and I just didn&#039;t get it, and maybe it is so, but I know I don&#039;t tend to miss stuff like that, so just try watching it and keep an eye out for that. I&#039;d drop it pretty quickly and look for other good shows. If you&#039;d like an interesting, incredibley insightful and smart LGBT manga, I recommend Shimanami Tasogare.<br />
i If you want a lighthearted anime to ease your mind, I&#039;d pick one that is meant for that, like Squid Girl or Yuru Camp. I feel like watching this is kind of a waste of your time in comparison to other works that are out there.<br />
<br />
The sound is actually beautiful, the op and ed songs are interesting and I kept noticing the beautiful background music through the anime. Kind of like Violet Evergarden&#039;s maybe, soft melodies that feel rich to me as far as I can tell. The tracks also kick in very unnoticabely and they don&#039;t take shame in silence and no track when it fits - which means a lot to me and was apparent in Idolish7 too, which is from Troyca as well.<br />
<br />
The visual art for the backgrounds is incredibly pretty, there is no slack in the visual metaphors and they were very good in my opinion, both visually and in their meaning and presentation. If only they had actual depth to resemble thoguh.<br />
<br />
I feel like that&#039;s about all I can say prety much. This left me feeling hollow, I don&#039;t see what&#039;s in here to like over other shows.

    Beautiful. This is my first impression of this show. The genre which depicting the love between women. So-called Girls Love and Yuri. I&#039;ve not watched those shows. It&#039;s a lit mood for me. When someone loves the person, it is important to understand the person&#039;s feelings. But this show is a little different case. People who have complicated states are conscious of each other. Not an easy thing. In that respect, this show is successful. The relationship began by the course of nature. It changes gradually, and fall in love with each other. The moment is irresistible. Just like true love. That isn&#039;t to say

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297164">
        their relationship develops romance. The balance is very good. They&#039;re so adorable. They&#039;re so sad at the same time. You can know this point when you watched this show. It&#039;s subject to the love of men and women. I praise to challenge lesbianism amongst all of them. In addition, perfection is a different order of magnitude. Excellent quality. Girls Love and Yuri are also a sort of entertainment though, they tend to avoid people. Because these series seldom exist. I don&#039;t mention it but I read a certain BL manga in the past. This manga is nothing short of brilliant. Very similar to this show. There is no miracle with love. Skill and spirit build up love. Acquire them and move forward in the future. As a result, it&#039;s a question against yourself.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s mention this show. Story and characters are depicting by affable touches from beginning to end. Awkward depictions don&#039;t exist at all. The protagonist of this show. Yuu Koito. A certain event made her start dating Touko Nanami. She is another main character of this show. Their characteristic is so good. Yuu is a robust girl. Nanami is a girl who is pampered with Yuu despite student council first‐class member. But Nanami has hidden circumstances. Thereby change has occurred with their relationship. She is basically the owner of sorrow heart. In some way, She is existing as opposed to Yuu. They exchange words in school, club activities, private. Yes, various situations. Some Girls Love scenes are included among them. Those make sprout special consciousness. They understand each other&#039;s mentality. In this way, this show is unique. It draws a line between other romance shows for me. The reason is that character development is very nice thoroughly. The script is also surprisingly well-written in every episode. I&#039;ve watched some shows of Jukki Hanada. This show is polite in terms of whole intervals and dialogue pacing. Thanks to the manga author&#039;s supervision, these are blameless. Yuu and Nanami are sensitive to personal feelings because they don&#039;t experience real love. It&#039;s dramatic.<br />
<br />
The visuals are very gorgeous. The disturbance is less and stable. Background and color are also well-made and shape elegant vibes. Character design is personally quite likable. To be honest, it&#039;s cute. So cute! Yuu&#039;s design is awesome. Nanami is also beautiful. OP and ED are stunning with animation and music. I cried OP for a period of time. What is the meaning of the language of the flowers? This show&#039;s OP is Riko Azuna&#039;s debut single. Her strong and delicate voice is fitting this show. I can expect her future activities. Her tie-up song plays a certain episode as an insert song. The timing is fitting well. Include splendid depiction, you&#039;ll have urges to experienced Attraction. ED is a character song by Yuu and Nanami. Not only catchy and bright melodies but profound lyrics are fitting this show so much. OP is also the same. Voice acting is perfect. Especially Sayaka&#039;s voice actor performed complex and real feelings against Nanami well.<br />
<br />
I sympathize with Maki&#039;s assertion but I&#039;m not pleased with his thought. Of course, This is his way of showing kindness to Yuu though, I&#039;m not interested in him.<br />
<br />
If I express this show besides I love this show so much, this show is so wonderful. All in all, this show is truly next level. Definitely one of my favorites. Everyone loves someone. Efforts will not always be awarded. The same may be said of anime and drama etc. It never everything goes well. That&#039;s why everyone faces each other while doing trial and error. This is made or break. Everything is up to you. It is important to define own purpose. This show is delightful to work generated by destiny. Your rating will change whether you can relate to Yuu and Nanami. I seldom meet a show which is loving by an author, staff, voice actors, and fans. I really appreciate them. YagaKimi FTW.

    TL;DR:<br />
Just perfect.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Just beautiful in all aspects. The romance and drama go hand in hand with each other but don&#039;t overstep their boundaries. The overall enjoyment was so good that I put it on hiatus for a bit so I don&#039;t binge it in a day like I normally do. The relationships and characters feel realistic and not overblown or exaggerated. Just a very cohesive anime that is just breathtaking.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
With any other romance anime, they usually have the stereotypical &quot;misunderstanding&quot; or have an argument that is meaningless, but here it uses very little or even none of those stereotypical tropes. In fact, it&#039;s more of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382437">
        self-realization anime with romance attached to it.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Breathtaking visual effects and animation, some with even added flare. And removing eyes during intense moments is an exceptionally good touch. It just adds to the eeriness and to the tense atmosphere, almost creepy in a way.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
A very clever balance of music and sound effects (such as wind) to create more intimate moments but using music for more lighthearted moments. Adding reverb as well when slow-motion shots are happening are just music to my ears. The music did its job; nothing really special but nothing bad either.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
The characters are somewhat basic but are realistic and not overblown. They grow from that base and form a complex tree full of branches if you will. It doesn&#039;t use any cliches a stupid number of times. The characters have legitimate reasons for their actions and how they feel, and because of that, we can understand why they feel the way they do; even if it may sound somewhat weird at first.<br />

Enjoyment:<br />
Being my first Yuri, and being an amazing anime as well, I had to stop myself from binging the whole anime in an entire day. I really had to savour it before finishing it. My mind kept wandering to &quot;What happens next?&quot; and automatically clicking the next episode button without thinking &quot;Hm, perhaps I should pace myself. &quot;.

    This is the first Yuri anime genre I&#039;ve seen, not gonna lie, it was a gem. Every scene gave me a fascinating impression of what will occur on the next episode, which made me truly advertised and couldn&#039;t hold myself to continue watching. This anime truly changed a ton of my anime aspects and it opened me up to a progressively huge region of new Yuri series.<br />
<br />
Story : 10/10 <br />
<br />
Yuu, a teenager female that enjoys reading shoujo manga. She awaits the day that she will get a love confession that sends her heart aflutter. However, when a junior high classmate confesses to her, she feels

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308349">
        nothing. Later on, she enters high school still unsure how to respond to her classmate&#039;s confession. Until she met a beautiful student council named Nanami. Yuu asked her for help, but then turns out Nanami confesses to her.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is something new to me, but I&#039;m really surprised about the adaptation of the manga to the anime. I&#039;ve begun reading the manga after I have completed this anime and it was quite comparable. I&#039;d say, the adaptation was great. And the story developments were obliged. Nothing&#039;s better than two girls dating each other aye?! <br />

Yuu, a young teenager female that appreciates perusing shoujo manga. She anticipates the day that she will get a love confession that sends her heart aflutter. Nonetheless, when a middle school classmate confesses to her, she feels nothing. Later on, she enters high school still uncertain how to respond to her colleague&#039;s confession. Until she met a wonderful student council named Nanami. Yuu approached her for assistance, but then things turns around, and Nanami confesses to her. <br />
<br />
This is something new to me, however I&#039;m truly astonished about the adaptation of the manga to the anime. I&#039;ve started perusing the manga after I have finished this anime and it was very comparable. I&#039;d state that the adaptation was great. What&#039;s more, the story developments were much obliged. ( Nothing&#039;s superior than two females dating each other yes?! ) <br />
<br />
Art : 9/10 <br />
<br />
To be honest, I was hesitating to watch this anime due to the art style and the trailer. But I was wrong, completely wrong. I judged this anime like a book by its cover and I&#039;m ashamed of myself for doing so. As I made up my mind and begun watching this anime and progressed through the episodes. The arts aren&#039;t bad, and I actually really like it. It seems simple yet good. <br />
<br />
I usually judge an anime by the animation, quality and art. &quot;If the animation, quality and art sucks. Everything else sucks.&quot; , this is my standpoint. Which is why I always hesitate to watch anime series like this due to my self awareness. This anime really jebaited me, and I&#039;m glad it did because if it didn&#039;t I&#039;d probably given this anime a solid 1/10 already. <br />
<br />
Sound : 8/10 <br />
<br />
The ending is very catchy, I even added it into my playlist on Youtube. The opening&#039;s not that great, and the background musics are &quot;okay&quot;. I don&#039;t really have anything to say about this besides the good voice actors and sound effects. Although the sound is great, there&#039;s an area of improvement. <br />

The ending is very snappy, I even added it into my playlist on Youtube. The opening&#039;s not excessively incredible, and the background musics are &quot;alright&quot;. I don&#039;t generally have anything to say about this other than the great voice actors and sound effects. In spite of the fact that the sound is incredible, there&#039;s still some area for improvement. <br />
<br />
Character : 10/10 <br />
<br />
First impression,&quot;oh wow&quot;. The character development of Yuu is exceeding. However, Nanami&#039;s character development wasn&#039;t that great in spite that she is also a main character. But hey, I&#039;m not a Yuri nerd or anything so I don&#039;t give a shit. As long as the two main characters always develop besides each other most of the time. I&#039;m happy enough to give it full points. <br />
<br />
First impression,&quot;oh wow&quot;. The character development of Yuu is surpassing. However, Nanami&#039;s character development wasn&#039;t that incredible in resentment that she is likewise a main character. But hey, I&#039;m not a Yuri geek or anything so I don&#039;t care the slightest bit. For whatever length of time that the two main characters dependably develop besides each other. I&#039;m happy enough to give it full points.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 10/10 <br />
<br />
I enjoyed this a lot, and I&#039;m really hoping that there&#039;d be a season 2 for this anime. <br />
<br />
Overall : 10/10 <br />
<br />
No doubt. First Yuri genre anime, best. I recommend this to be your first Yuri anime if you&#039;re interested in this genre as well.

    What exactly is love? Is it a feeling of trying to protect someone you treasure, or is it a feeling of gratitude for someone you deeply care about? There’s no exact answer for it, but everyone has their own ideal of how love is, and with this idea adding a sprinkle of yuri, may I introduce you, Yagate Kimi Ni Naru (Bloom Into You), a show focusing on our two female protagonist, Koito Yuu and Nanami Touko, and their journey onto finding what love, truly means. <br />
<br />
Story / Character -9.5- <br />
Within the first few minutes you get greeted by our first protagonist, Koito Yuu, whom

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297175">
        is heavily obsessed in shoujo manga, and looks forward to having a heart pumping relationship, in which feels seemingly distant and unreachable for Yuu. Now being a high school student, Yuu was chosen to help out with the Student Council election. While trying to find out where the club is, she stumbled upon our next protagonist, Nanami Touko whom was being confessed by another male student. Having seen Touko rejecting the student, with the ‘excuse’ of not wanting to go out with anyone just yet, Yuu decides to consult her as Yuu herself too, is being bothered by the fact that her best friend confessed to her, and she didn’t feel the ‘spark’ she initially thought she might have. Thinking how Nanami senpai might’ve help her settle her problems, with the turn of the tide, Nanami suddenly confesses to Yuu, leaving Yuu in absolute confusion. What comes next are lovely moments that will surely make you go ‘awww’. <br />
Character wise, unlike what you see in most romance anime, the dominant one usually is the older ones, or the male lead (in this case it’s irrelevant). However, Touko albeit being a third year, is constantly showing her weaknesses, lowering her guard when she is around with Yuu, whom is younger than her. Even though as affectionate as Touko is, Yuu has convinced herself that she wouldn’t fall in love with Touko (or is it (͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖) and in return for Touko’s feelings, Yuu tends to be more kind towards her, and allows her to cling onto her even though Yuu doesn’t plan on returning her feelings. Other character such as Saeki senpai and the teacher adds the depth for the story, making the story not necessarily just about Yuri at its core, but also people finding the true meaning to their life. Quite a simple plot to understand, everything you’d expect from a shoujo ai but with a touch of uniqueness to the dialogues and monologues.<br />
<br />
Art -9- <br />
This is a great adaptation from the original manga series, characters look on point, animations are very fluid. One unexpected part that totally blew me away was the use of camera angles, some scenes were literally breathed life into them, and some made the scene extraordinarily dream-like. All in all, Troyca has done an exceptional job on adapting this manga into anime, and I think it’s very commendable for making this anime such an enjoyable one.<br />
<br />
Sound -8.5-<br />
Most of the voice acting are done pretty well with some rare occasions where I actually found them to be slightly underwhelming, but not average enough to take a point off from the overall voice acting, so nothing to complain about here. The opening and ending are also quite good, I personally prefer the ending more than the opening, as it has a catchier vibe to it, and is sang by the two main protagonists. Soundtrack wise is sort of a mixed feeling (mostly good), what you usually here are ambient sound, like literally life-like ambient sounds, not many fancy soundtracks are going on throughout this anime, but they convey the feelings very well and tend to fit in the scenes. I personally just wished there was more to it, other than mostly being ambient. <br />
<br />
Overall -9-<br />
Bloom into you is a must watch if you’re a big fan of the romance genre, taking the slower, gradual progression for the plot makes you more invested into the characters, and I think that is a great way to catch the audience’s heart. Even though the plot is rather simple, the way it was executed through good directing and writing really makes this anime all the better. The conclusion for the anime isn&#039;t necessary what I thought it would&#039;ve been (in relation to the manga that is), but was still a very wholesome nonetheless. If you want something that can hit you home, look no further and hope onto the feel train, and let the anime Bloom Into You. <br />
