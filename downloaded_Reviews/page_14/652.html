    Drifters is the type of show that you’ll quickly realize what it is from the start. Anyone familiar with Kouta Hirano (known for his work “Hellsing”) will get a familiar vibe with the style of the series. If you fancy a fantasy story about extraordinary individuals coming together, then Drifters will be quite a treat. <br />
<br />
Adapted from the manga of the same name, Drifters initially will leave the impression of a dark fantasy tale. The first few episodes easily establishes its premise as we meet the Drifters, the main protagonists of the show. They are based on historical figures who are based from their timeline.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236312">
        Still, throughout the series, you’ll probably designate them more as anti-heroes by their actions. The primary cast composes of Shimazu Toyohisa, Oda Nobunaga, and Nasu Suketaka Yoichi. Thanks to a mysterious man named Murasaki, they are bought together to stand against evil. Against them are the Ends, characters who ironically weren’t evil during their timeline. At the same time, Drifters are aided by a mysterious group of magicians known as the Octobrists. Get the idea now? Drifters is essentially a dark fantasy war that brings together history’s most infamous figures into one big oddball package.<br />
<br />
From the first few episodes, the show will test a viewer’s patience. This is because even though the show has a dark and grim atmosphere, it also tries to sell its comedy and humor. That’s right, the show adapts humor to spice up the entertainment. This can be seen as a throwback as people may not take the show seriously. However, if you can get with the momentum, then Drifters will be a pleasant surprise. Understanding the show’s lore will also enhance your enjoyment of this show. To be honest, what really can draw an audience’s interest is about the characters. Each of them possesses a rather intriguing personality and their roles in the story often spark curiosity. <br />
<br />
Shimazu is the main protagonist and also leader of the Drifters. Shimazu is pretty much a natural leader as he is courageous with no fear. His charisma is also a characteristic that inspires others (such as elves) to follow up during the war. We can easily see that he is driven by determination by putting himself above others. The elves and dwarves respects him not just as a Drifter but also a friend. On the other hand, we have Oda Nobunaga. As a strategist, it’s no surprise that he has a brilliant mind. However, he is also a character to be wary of even by his own allies. His sarcastic personality becomes a big joke throughout the show as he brings in the most comedy. As part of the group, Yoichi can be mistaken for a trap because of his feminine appearance. However, he is a guy to be feared when facing against his bow. Later on, we also meet others that joins in their quest as the war turns into a chaotic pandemonium.<br />
<br />
The main antagonists are the End. Perhaps the most mysterious and also recognizable would be the Black King. His ultimate goal is to destroy humanity and replace it with a new race in his vision. As leader of the Ends, we don’t find out too much about him. This is perhaps where characterization in the show suffers a bit. We get this all mighty character that operates from the shadows yet not much is known about him, even his past. Luckily, the other Ends brings in more interest such as Easy, a young woman with odds against Murasaki. Anastasia Romanov and Joan of Arc are also ironically the villains in this show, as people may recognize them as heroines from other lores. The one noticeable trait that separates the Ends and the Drifters though is power. Ends seems to possess supernatural abilities, something that the Drifters lack. While Drifters rely on their own natural talent, weapons, and technology, Ends can perform superhuman feats. For instance, Anastasia is able to freeze others while Gilles de Rais can use inhuman strength and durability. As you may guess, the show pits them in battles between the Drifters and Ends like fate. The war itself has a purpose although everyone has their own reasons for fighting. However, it’s up to the audience to decide if those are meaningful or not.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned before, the show has a lot of comedy. Whether these may be character interactions or historical in-jokes, it’s always there. One thing that does hold the storytelling back at times is the pacing. It seems at times, the show emphasizes a bit too much on the humor at the expense of other elements. While Oda Nobuanga is a big example of this, others such as Count Saint-Germi from the Orte Empire adds more. The buildup of the story between some episodes can also feel lacking depending on preferences. And because the series is created by Kouta Hirano, you can expect some Nazi references to be introduced as well. That’s right, if you’re thinking Hitler then you’re correct. The show even has a bit of fantasy racism! On the other hand, do take in for granted when the action picks up. This show is no joke when it comes to making a spectacle of battles. When the pacing picks up, it’s where the series really shines and will make you feel that all the buildup worth the wait. <br />
<br />
Adapted by Hoods Entertainment, the show is pretty accurate with its manga art style. This is what impresses me a lot when I first watched this series as it’s on spot, almost frame by frame for the character designs. Not to mention, both the Drifters and Ends are characterized with their badass look ranging from Shimazu’s weapons to Yoichi’s sharp eyes. Speaking of that, the show has a distinctive style of adapting its character features. This is especially recognized by the intimidating looks of Ends as they look convincingly menacing. The setting of the battles is also decorated with a dark fantasy look with ruins, ancient castles, etc. Add ultraviolence and minimal censorship and you get Drifters at its finest. <br />
<br />
Soundtrack is also pretty noticeable throughout the show ranging from especially the theme songs. It’s stylistic and filled with creativity. While some people may call it silly, I see it more as a expressing the show’s humor and almost feels satirical. The OST and soundtrack has a hardcore instrumental tone during the battle scenes that is highly entertaining. Character voice mannerism throughout show is also noticeable even at times when the dialogues gets overly silly. Perhaps the most noticeable are those of Oda Nobunaga mainly for his commanding voice. <br />
<br />
By the time I finished watching Drifters, I was not only impressed by the overall content but also for its ability to entertain. If you have a sense of humor, then this will definitely be worth every minute of time. If you take it too seriously though, then Drifters will probably feel more like a chore to watch. I would definitely recommend Drifters even if you’re not a fan of the author’s works. I can’t say this enough but Hirano’s ability to express his ideas are just too damn entertaining to evade.<br />

    &quot;FATALITY!&quot; -Every Mortal Kombat game since 1992.<br />
<br />
*SPOILERS FOR DRIFTERS*<br />
<br />
War is hell. We know this to be true by now. This also applies to the fact about there being a lot of &quot;sent to another world&quot; anime adaptations. You really need to do something really unique to stand out if you&#039;re one of these shows, and while I&#039;d like to say that SAO and Re:Zero conditioned me to think otherwise, its obvious that their additions to the concept alone (bloodthirsty video game world and reset after death respectively) were what made them stand out, even if the actual concept, for most part does the exact opposite.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236285">
        With this show, they decided to make it have a full-fledged war, with loads of carnage peppered throughout. The concept is very interesting, especially since the war consists of famous people from many different eras of different countries. It&#039;s sort of like the Fate/ series, except that this time, all of the combatants were based on real people instead of sprinkling mythological people into the mix. So, was this a true breath of fresh air for the genre? Did it manage to do that while being a genuinely great war story? Well, let&#039;s find out, shall we?<br />
<br />
So, there is some kind of conflict between Easy and Murasaki (which doesn&#039;t get explained or fleshed out) that caused them to start sending people to this unidentified new world in which there are two main factions at war: Drifters (deceased war heroes), and Ends (once noble beings who have gone bad for their own reasons tying into their demise, but not all of them have their backstory shown to us). There are also humans who enslave two kinds of demi-humans: elves, and dwarves. Drifters are fighting to bring down the human governments of this world via conquest, and destroy the Ends, while the Ends are fighting to destroy the world and all inhabitants (despite the fact that their leader just wants the demi-humans to be the main inhabitants). So, what the hell happened here?<br />
<br />
Ultimately, the first few episodes were rough. Not only were there some minor plot holes, but there is one gigantic issue that really damages this series: the tone shifts. You can have a moment in which villagers all horrifyingly stab a man to death in brutal fashion, and then seconds later, they show cracks a random joke. They do this so often, and sometimes, in the most inopportune of times, ruining some of the darker and heavier moments of the show. Sure, this means that, inevitably, a few of these end up being funny, but, for most part, they end up harming more than helping. <br />
<br />
The series does pick up, but a few new issues really hamper this show. Every time one of the Ends is about to die or be defeated, we suddenly get their backstory in order to make the story sad, and that just doesn&#039;t work. In order for that to work, we need the characters to be more than just one-dimensional baddies before-hand, and they pull this stunt three times! Also, the finale just...ends, without any major resolution. Just, a battle ends, and here is one image of where each Drifter is at the moment, in an obvious, and quite frankly, rushed sequel-hook, particularly because some of the characters, like Scipio and Butch Cassidy, have been left by the wayside, especially Scipio with the fact that he has been left in the jungle but suddenly he&#039;s in a navy ship with a character that has only been seen for one brief moment. Hell, there are other moments that required some time to explain, like how the Drifters suddenly got human armor when their last battle (which was two episodes prior) didn&#039;t have nearly as many people killed to remotely equal the amount of armor and weapons present. Shame too, since if this concept was explored more and the story were tightened up, this would&#039;ve definitely been a good first season to what looks to be an otherworldly war epic.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s really hard to tolerate these &quot;Drifters&quot; early on. I mean, they were all a bunch of quarreling assholes without anything interesting about their character, and by the end of it, some of the more minor additions (like Hannibal and Scipio) were still like that. Luckily, our main trio grew. Toyo is a crazed warrior who loves decapitating enemy warriors, as long as they are male. His culture and all Japanese war cultures at the time do not like the thought of women engaged in combat. He ends up also being a bot more chivalrous towards females and children than his cohorts while understanding people more than he probably should (reminding me a lot of Ragna the Bloodedge, from the Blazblue game series) and I&#039;ll touch on that in a bit. Nobunaga is a much more brutal tactician as well as being a hardier individual than his allies. His violent streak, as a result of his culture and his multiple times being betrayed, makes for some of the best usages of military tactics I&#039;ve seen in a war anime in quite some time. Yoichi ends up being more in between when it comes to his companions&#039; traits, but with more of a tragic war past, which is shallowly explored via his commander, who ends up chatting with him once, and that&#039;s it. He&#039;s probably the least interesting of the trio, but at least, he ends up being the crux of some of the better comedy moments of the first 3 episodes. <br />
<br />
Butch Cassidy and the other Drifters are infinitely less interesting, but he is easily the most tolerable of them (along with The Sundance Kid for how little he shows up), with him actually doing some cool stuff. Sure, Naoshi takes down some dragons in a WWII plane, but he&#039;s just there to provide some refreshing amounts of swearing, which ends up becoming excessive. There is also Count Saint-Germi (the son of Hitler) with his coup d&#039;etat scheme, and his annoying posse (Alester and Flemi), but they are mostly there to be annoying and provide bad comedy until the count himself starts that plan with the Drifters to overthrow the human government.<br />
<br />
The Octobrists are overall very uninteresting, except for Olmine, who is constantly made fun of for her voluptuous breasts, but has some genuinely great interactions with Toyo, as he shows her some good chivalry and allows her to use her spells to great effect in the latter half of the series. She is literally the only remotely interesting Octobrist. As for the Ends, with exception of The Black King, all of them are as plain as they come (with the slight exception of Anastasia, who is barely in this show). Then, they (except for Anestasia and Rasputin) get their backstories to explain why they are so evil and a bit about how that ties in with their powers (Only Joan of Arc does. Gilles de Rais and Hijikata doesn&#039;t get anything relating to his powers, and nobody gets their power origins outright explained) in a poor attempt at making these lame characters come off as tragic, which is really horrible given their real-life counterparts. <br />
<br />
The Black King is an interesting figure, wanting better civilization for the demi-humans, and being able to create food as well as grow cells (to regenerate, but also to harm, as shown with the Bronze Dragon in episode 10), but even with his somewhat interesting motivations and enigmatic figure, he can&#039;t really make up for how bland his subordinates are. Easy is the one who sends the bad guys in, is moody, and that&#039;s about it aside from having a cutesy and girly room to herself. Murasaki is even more bland, though. Overall, despite a few characters that grew to be legitimately interesting and compelling, the cast is stupidly bland at best, and irritating at worst.<br />
<br />
Hoods Drifters Studio (not to get confused with Hoods Entertainment, though they may or may not be affiliated) is brand new to this game, and they did a really good job with their first series, which is, of course, this. As if to make up for the writing quality, the action is refreshingly brutal, with loads of decapitation and blood, and no censorship anywhere. It&#039;s pretty fun seeing how much of a chaotic gore-fest the action scenes are, and they detail some of the bullet moments and impacts very well. The character models, while looking similar to Kouta Hirano&#039;s most popular work, Hellsing Ultimate, they also feel realistic and sorta unique. The only problem I have isn&#039;t with the art-stye change during most of the comedy moments, but rather with the usage of CGI for the dragons and some of the soldiers. They try to cover it up and make it work with everything, but it doesn&#039;t really help much, as it looks awkward. Luckily, that problem is barely present in the second half. Some moments in the earlier episodes are a bit off though. Still, I really hope to see this studio grow since they did such an impressive job with their first project.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have such high praises for the music, sadly. Gospel of the Throttle (by Minutes &#039;Til Midnight), the OP of the series, doesn&#039;t fit the show as well as I wish. On its own, it&#039;s a slick piece, but I don&#039;t feel it works here. Luckily, the ED, Vermillion (by Maon Kurosaki) is a very good song, with a more epic and buildup heavy feel to it that really fits with how gruesome and heavy the show can be. The rest of the OST isn&#039;t memorable or worthwhile at all, save for one ok piece. The dub is pretty alright. No major hiccups here, but nothing spectacular in terms of performances. It&#039;s a relatively solid dub so far. <br />
<br />
Honestly, despite how cool and refreshing the action scenes were, this show kinda left me feeling bored and annoyed every now and then, especially in the first half. I admit, the action is fun, and some moments were definitely bleak, the horrible tone-shifts really leave me dazed and confused, and completely taken out of the experience, which is horrible given that one of these moments take place immediately after the darkest moment of the show! If not for the cool action, this wouldn&#039;t have engaged me at all, especially since the first 3 episodes left me with the feeling of darkness-induced apathy. I nearly dropped it during those first 3 episodes and even then, outside of fight scenes, this show is still very boring at times. Plus, not a lot of the gags make me laugh, but at least some of them do.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, while this is a very gruesome action show and some of the gags get a laugh here and there, this show is a tonal mess that&#039;s hard to care about on any level that isn&#039;t related to primal, epic bloodbaths. At the very least, I hope that this series ends up bringing some notoriety for Hoods Drifters Studio. Still, this show is a bit of a disappointment. With all that said, I bid you adieu.

    Before starting my review, I would like to note that almost every character of Drifters is a historical figure, so I would highly recommend you to use Google from time to time. Drifters uses American historical figures, Japanese historical figures, French historical figures, Russian historical figures, and others. Anyways, let us start.<br />
<br />
 Drifters: Battle in a Brand-new World War, Drifters, orドリフターズ, is a fantasy, alternate history Japanese manga written and illustrated by Kouta Hirano. The manga started serialization in Shounen Gahosha magazine, Young King Ours, on April 30, 2009. It received an anime adaptation, which was announced in May, 2015 and aired between October 7,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236335">
        2016 and December 23, 2016. A second season has also been announced. <br />
<br />
 Toyohisa of the Shimazu clan is in the heat of the battle of Sekigahara in 1600, which signaled the start of the Tokugawa shogunate in Japan; the only thing he thinks about is how to behead the enemy commander and he is ready to achieve this goal by all means. Having fatally injured the enemy commander, Toyohisa is also about to die. Suddenly he finds himself in a white corridor, facing a man in strange clothes sitting at a desk in a white corridor. A moment later he is sent to a new land, where some unknown historical figures treat his wounds. Shortly after that he finds out that he, as well as his new companions, are Drifters. Why were Drifters sent to this world? Find out the answer now! <br />
<br />
 The story-line of Drifters is worthy. There are still; however, some things that should be explained, but I would not call it a problem, since a second season was announced a day, or two ago. Drifters is violent; all history anime should be like Drifters. However, I have one major complaint and I am sure that you will not like it either: humor. Being a fan of Hellsing, I was expecting a portion of Hellsingish humor, but Drifters clearly overused it: it is not funny and outdated. I mean, come on, boob jokes? Really? Why not spend more time on characters and story-line? Is it that difficult? Anyways, it is not a big problem and you will still enjoy Drifters. To be precise, that is the only problem of Drifters. <br />
<br />
 The art and music are very similar to Hellsing, so if you have already seen Hellsing Ultimate, you will recognize it immediately and will not have any problems with it. If you have not seen Hellsing Ultimate yet, it will not be a problem, either. The art style is amazing, every single detail of all characters is just beautiful. And, yes, that Japanese themed Alucard is just badass. The music, however, did not leave a huge impression on me. Of course, the voice actors did one hell of a job, but I was hoping to see something close to what was in Hellsing Ultimate. Anyway, the music used in Drifters is a mix of traditional Japanese music, jazzy beats, and rock. <br />
<br />
  The characters are very entertaining. As I have already mentioned, some of them did not receive enough development, but they will surely receive enough development in the new season. With that being said, we spend a lot time with the Japanese warriors: Shimazu Toyohisa, Oda Nobunaga, and Nasu Yoichi Suketaka. Their trio is very interesting, because they all are different. Shimazu is a warrior that only wants to behead his enemy; however, at the same time, he is also a true warrior, who will never harm a woman. Nasu is a young archer, who does not have any leader qualities; yet, he is also a fearless warrior. Oda is the most dangerous person in this group, because he is a true leader, he does not care where he is, because he is a true genius that will capture any town even with a bunch of amateurs. <br />
<br />
 Anyways, the characters are very interesting to follow. As the story-line progresses, Drifters shows us more about its characters’ background. And while some of Drifters do have regrets, they are still ready to go on and it is very exciting. However, there is also one problem I would like to mention, the comedy part. Jesus Christ, it is simply awful. I do agree that the comedy part is needed even in some gruesome anime, but it should not be overused. The problem is that you are watching a serious episode and you are trying to understand the problem; however, Drifters shows you these comedy moments disturbing you. It is simply impossible to concentrate and it is very annoying. <br />
<br />
 As for enjoyment, this anime is very enjoyable and if you are a fan of Hellsing Ultimate, you will not have any problems with it. If you have not seen Hellsing Ultimate yet, I would highly recommend you to watch it first, but it is up to you, of course. It is not a must do. <br />
<br />
 All in all, Drifters is not flawless, the comedy part ruined this masterpiece, in my opinion. Yes, it is very annoying, but you should not ignore this anime because of it, please do not do it, it is still awesome. On top of that, the most important thing is that it will receive a continuation, so you will not have to wait years predicting if it will, or will not receive a new season. Drifters is an anime I would highly recommend to every single anime fan; however, if you are a big hater of Hellsing Ultimate, I would highly recommend you to think twice before watching Drifters.

    Another magnificent anime has come to an end, however we will receive a SECOND SEASON. The hype is REAL. <br />
<br />
Now to start off, I am a fan of the manga, and I can tell that a lot of love has been put into the development of this anime. It didn&#039;t miss a single important event, and you can feel the love of the creators every week while watching it. <br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
It is a magnificent story, although I can&#039;t be certain that it is a unique one. What makes this experience incredible, is that the characters in it, are historical figures, from different eras, dating back to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236234">
        1500&#039;s and earlier. Every character is done with insane attention to detail, and once you start watching it, if you are not familiar with these characters, you are inclined to google them and get to know their stories, because they are so incredible to watch. <br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
The art can be described as STUNNING. I don&#039;t know what the budget is, but if every anime can have that quality it will be a godsend. Buildings, backgrounds, character designs, everything is marvelous. I can&#039;t really find nothing bad about the quality. Also you get ZERO censorship, which makes the experience even more enjoyable, as you lose track of time, while getting engulfed in the story, which has incredible pacing. There is no rushing in this adaptation. <br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
Very good, great OP and ED. There are some instrumentals during the episodes which fit perfectly in the premise of the story. Everything through the sound of the sword to the shots of the gun is how it should be. <br />
<br />
Character<br />
<br />
I have already a bit for the characters, but nevertheless here are some of the figures that are in it: Toyohisa Shimazu, Oda Nobunaga, Nasu Yoichi, Saint Germi, Abe no Seimei, Rasputin, Dark King (you will find out who he is), Hijikata Toshizou, Joan of Arc, Guilles de Raimes, Anastasia Romanov, Hannibal, Scipio, Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid ... just to name a few. It is an incredible watch.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and Overall<br />
<br />
I have looked forward to this every week. It is truly a worthwhile anime that is for everyone who enjoys incredible visuals, historical figures, great fighting, strategies of war and most of all a satisfying story. Watch this, because you will be sorry if you don&#039;t.

    If you want a concise review that isn&#039;t riddled with vague pseudo-intellectual nonsense, read this one.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s basically a crossover of many historical figures from different eras going at war with each other. They have their exact names, personalities, and have some an ability associated to some element of their lives.<br />
<br />
You&#039;ll have to google some of the historical figures to understand some of their interactions. In other cases, you&#039;ll have to guess because they&#039;re not explicitly revealed.<br />
<br />
Drawing style is like that of Hellsing. Combat animation is very fluid. Combat includes war strategies, not only direct combat. Accurate portrayal of historical figures.

    Before you scroll away I want you to at least read this following sentence : &quot;Oda Nobunaga, Jeanne dArc, Saint Germain, Rasputin, etc.. You get to see all of them together in this anime.&quot; <br />
<br />
Yep. That&#039;s right. If you have seen the fate franchise then this is pretty much the same with a little twist. So basically these historical figures die, they get isekaied into the same world where they either become one side or another ( drifter vs end ). They fight against each other in order to.. Conquer the world I guess?<br />
<br />
Yeah that&#039;s about it. Be wary that this ends as a bigass

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353523">
        cliffhanger. Regardless, Drifters was still very fun to watch and ain&#039;t it always cool to see historical figures interacting with each other? The more history you have inside your head the better the experience from watching Drifters.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Drifters. A show that could have introduced as many historic figures as it wanted to, making an engaging but also complex story with a clash of ideologies being present. Instead, Drifters chose to take a route that completely diminishes its strengths and instead focuses on the show’s weakest part, that being the character interactions. With a very limited cast of characters, most of whom are Japanese, some of the choices for the characters are just nonsensical. For example, the author adds Naoshi Kanno, a pilot that died during World War 2, leaving out Otto Kittel with 267 aerial victories, which, compared to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398879">
        Kanno’s 25 is just nonsensical. The author is afraid to experiment. Most of the characters are Japanese, those who are not are either one dimensional or just boring. Rasputin is a prime example of how the show handles and utilizes characters that aren’t Japanese; It does not. The characters that are actually given the care and development needed for their ideology to be completely understood can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The characters that do get fleshed out are either boring or just lack logic in their ideology. The characters, as mentioned before, are undeniably the weakest part of the show. While some of their conflicts concerning morals could have been interesting, they are quickly diminished by the awful comedy which shifts the tone in a matter of seconds, yet the author is unable to go back to the established dark tone after a comedy scene. <br />
<br />
Picture this: You enter a caste full of elves that have been mentally and physically abused and want freedom for their race and themselves. While you are trying to save them, your partner makes an unfunny joke and everyone stops whatever they are doing for 15 seconds and continues to run the gag, which was already unfunny, making it even more annoying than it already was. This was, in summary, the comedy of Drifters. Dark Fantasy, Seinen and Comedy as genres can work, however, not when the Comedy aspect of the show is even more relevant and utilized than the 2 aforementioned. Drifters thrive in the moments when it is dark. The problem is, it does not really have those moments too often since every event that is even slightly serious will quickly get turned into an unfunny comedy gag that will just make everyone cringe at it. One of those rare instances when Drifters was serious was in the last siege. Mostly every battle went by without anyone making a joke and it was genuinely satisfying to be able to watch a fight scene without a chibi version of a character popping up on the screen every 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Aside from the comedy, some of the ideas and themes are actually executed fairly well. With Nobunaga and the idea that every battle is a mental one, not a physical one and that idea completely contrasting that of Toyohisa was well done and overall just a solid dynamic between those 2 was presented during the series. The Ends vs Drifters conflict was the main one of the series. While it was one dimensional for the most part, the last battle featured a lot of character interaction and dialogue which helped elevate the conflict’s weight and its quality, which would have happened much earlier if not for the comedy taking up almost half an episode in some instances. With the Octobrists serving as a third party in this conflict, being on the Drifters’ side for the most part, they were all just uninteresting, similar to their dialogue, the themes they portrayed and the character interactions surrounding them. Olmine, the only noteworthy of the bunch, portrays the very important theme of the big breasts. That was her only quality during most of the show, serving as a comedic relief and fan service in one character, setting her up to be amazingly trash. With all that being said, Olmine did not end up as bad as she could have. Redeeming herself with her interactions and dialogue with Toyo, she ends up actually making an impact in the later parts of the series, which was genuinely a welcome surprise to say the least.<br />
<br />
Making likeable antagonists but having them also be a driving force for the series, directly contrasting the protagonist is hard, many series have, however, done it. When a likeable antagonist is mentioned, most people will think of Kira from JoJo, L from Death Note, Askeladd from Vinland Saga, Meruem from Hunter x Hunter and so on, no one will, however, mention the antagonists from Drifters. Having a character that is evil for the sake of it can often fail, if executed correctly, however, they can be as interesting as an antagonist can get. The antagonists of Drifters have an identity crisis. They cannot decide if they want to be evil for the sake of it or some kind of tragic hero in search of the right path. The Ends are depicted as pure evil, only wanting destruction. When any of them are close to dying, however, we get a flashback showing how they did not want to end up as the bad guys, the world just made them bad guys. That sounds as edgy as it gets, but is exactly what the show tries to depict in each of these characters. It tries making the viewer care for the End and their death but does so in minimal screen time given to each of them, making it near impossible to care for any of them. Once again, as always, the show thrives on the original idea. If you liked any of the Ends in their actual history and real life, you will like their tragic depiction here, for the most part. At the end of the day, each antagonist is bland with the exact same execution and character conclusion, with the exception of the Black King, who was the only interesting one of the bunch. His ideology of reforming the world with demi-humans and the scene of them farming was actually terrifying, as well as intriguing. He made a demi-human farm. He managed to control an uncontrollable species. Being depicted as pure evil for most of the show, even his tragic backstory did not ruin the quality of his character as much as it did for others, seeing as he does something else other than fight one of the Drifters and die. <br />
<br />
Easy vs Murasaki, the 2 masterminds. Another concept of Drifters that felt like it was just there to be there. What could have been an amazing ideology clash between those 2, reflected on their choices of people and paired up with symbolism could have elevated the show to a whole nother level. At the end, those are all speculations. What happened was, in classic Drifters style, a comedic relief relationship with nothing else to offer. Easy yells at Murasaki who is either not there, or simply does not care. This was their entire relationship that was showcased summed up.<br />
<br />
The animation was rough, however, in a good way. It was a pleasure being able to watch some of the fight scenes, those that were not ruined by, once again, the comedy. Overall, the visuals were of high quality, reminiscent of Hellsing, which was directed by the same person, Suzuki Kenichi. <br />
<br />
If I were to give 2 words that perfectly sum up Drifters, in my opinion, those would be: Wasted potential. I was perplexed by how bad the premise was handled and am still genuinely baffled at how such a great premise managed to fall flat in the span of only 12 episodes. With me giving it a score of 5, that being average, I consider the execution itself to be much worse than that, however, just the ideas that the show presents but does not deliver upon are more than enough to raise its rating, even if it is still on the lower scale of the spectrum. All in all, it was bad. Not Ex Arm levels of bad, still bad, however. <br />

    Yo waddup waddup i&#039;m here to bring you some reality checks about this overhyped messy disappointment. This&#039;ll probably be a pretty short review focusing mostly on the negatives, but that&#039;s only because i don&#039;t have much to say about this anime. It&#039;s pretty forgettable.<br />
<br />
So obviously all the hype comes from the fact that this is from the author of Hellsing, which instantly got thousands of edgy teens to get a hard-on. We expected insane badassery, gruesome fights and a level of cool that would make all the panties drop. Too bad we got none of that, but instead just a faint shadow of the author&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236262">
        previous work.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the story, ey? So the story starts with (just read the synopsis, you idiots). What really made the story so boring is that you never feel any threat surrounding our main characters. There&#039;s a lot of build-up going on, but almost no actual conflict. The guys are mostly just fighting small fry all the time or talking about war strategy or how fascinated they are with the different technologies that were brought into this world. And god damn do they talk a lot! We get it! Y&#039;all come from different times, y&#039;all got different ideologies and ideas about war, just get over with it and go fight some baddies! I think there&#039;s only 2 instances where they fight some actually strong villains, but even then there&#039;s no tension because you know they&#039;re gonna win for sure and i don&#039;t really care enough about the characters to give a damn about those fights.<br />
<br />
Oh boy, here comes my favorite part: the motherloving characters (i&#039;m not allowed to swear, but you get the point)! What makes the characters so bland and forgettable is that their range of emotions can be summed up into 3 states: grinning, grinning and more grinning. Holy smoking Jesus on a bagel do these guys grin a lot! They grin in the face of danger, they grin when they&#039;re talking, when they&#039;re sleeping, when they&#039;re pooping, like they don&#039;t give a damn about anything. And while it&#039;s cool and all to not be afraid of anything, it also becomes really stale really fast. Also, this combined with the fact that they all come from different time periods makes them completely unrelatable to the average viewer. You might find some enjoyment if you&#039;re a japanese history nerd, but since i&#039;m not a filthy weeb like y&#039;all, i ain&#039;t really familiar with it. Turns out Oda Nobunaga wasn&#039;t such a big deal, considering how weak and one-dimensional his character is.<br />
<br />
Probably an unpopular opinion, but the visuals are also mediocre. At points the show is unbarable for the eyes, and that&#039;s for a few reasons: 1. Too much dark! I think every single fight takes place at night, which not only is monotonous as hell, but also hurts my eyes. And it&#039;s not like the collor pallet is dark, it feels like the image is forcefully made to look dark with some blak clouds constantly hoveing in front of the image and blurring it. Reality check bastards: Just cause a show is forcefully made to look dark, doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s dark. Actually, this is one of the most light-hearted shows i&#039;ve seen in a while. 2. Bad direction. Lots of weird close-ups to the character&#039;s faces, and fights are often uncomprehensible. 3. Sometimes the character&#039;s faces look like they&#039;re moving independently from their bodies (pretty small detail but still bugs me). The show uses that technique of thick outlines that makes it look like a Madhouse show, but pretty much fails at bringing out the beauty of that style. Hellsing Ultimate looks 10x better even though it was made in the late 2000s.<br />
<br />
The sound is pretty damn good if i do say so myself. We&#039;ve got some pretty epic and stylish BGM that goes well with the tone of the show. Not to mention that opening is insane! In fact, the OP is so good that i would watch it 10 times in a row rather than watch an entire episode.<br />
<br />
And one final thing that really breaks the experience: the overusage of slapstick comedy. The show would oftenly go full chibi making you feel like you&#039;re watching something completely different, and while Hellsing had a bareable ammount of this, Drifters just has to go into full cringe mode every 3 minutes.<br />
-Hey, how should we animate this part?<br />
-Do a chibi comedy scene.<br />
-But we had one 2 minutes ago and this scene isn&#039;t particularly fun-<br />
-I SAID DO A CHIBI COMEDY SCENE!!!<br />
<br />
So yeah, nothing really makes this show stand out from its contemporaries. Not saying it&#039;s bad or anything, there is some quality and enjoyment to be had, but considering what has been done in the past, this show is far from being up there with the big guys.

    This anime had me excited from the very beginning. The first episode had me craving more. I was desperate to know where it was going. The characters are astoundingly unique in personality. The whole idea of the series feels refreshing to the anime that have been released. Absolutely wonderful, excited for a next season Things they could have done better were to give more insight as to what the puppeteers were doing, who were they, and why. Though to many of you, it may not be a 10, it is one to me as I found it to be nigh perfect.<br />

    Drifters - &quot;Battle in a brand new world war.&quot;<br />
<br />
That could be all I need to write since, as far as I&#039;ve seen, the show has lived up to that thesis grandly. <br />
<br />
But lets talk about it a little more just for giggles.<br />
<br />
This show was a bit of a wildcard for me personally, given that I haven&#039;t read the manga or seen either of the directors crowning achievements (Hellsing and the latest iteration of JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure), but after the synopsis piqued my interest, and the Promotional Video&#039;s came out, I was sold. Further Drifters was produced by a studio that has not been responsible for any...

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236568">
        respectable, none the less epic or badass shows that I am aware of. While avoiding either spoiling anything important or going over things you should already know (from reading the MAL synopsis), I will share my thoughts.<br />
<br />
For Animation - <br />
Drifters does not disappoint in most areas, and definitely not its main animation style and fight scenes. For the most part it has managed to keep CG at a minimum, avoiding the usage of hideous clones or terrible blends of hand-drawn and computer-assisted animation in favor of a uniquely beautiful style that you must see to appreciate (and yes, you do get used to it after the first few seconds). The only blow against this otherwise stellar track record is its usage of &quot;Chibi&quot; or an almost cutesy style during purely comedic moments. I believe that this contrasts rather sharply with the extremely epic and, for the most part, serious feel of the show, however; like the overall animation style, you do get used to it.<br />
<br />
For sound - <br />
This is one area are where the overwhelmingly positive influence of Hellsing (so I hear, no pun intended) comes in very clearly. In a word, it rocks. After the first episode finished, and I heard the opening for the first time, in addition to several other background tunes that were especially good, I had no doubt that I was in good hands with regard to the sound department.<br />
It should come as no surprise that it was only a week later that I learned that the song I had heard was not the opening - it was the ending, and I had been fooled by how epic it was into thinking it was the opening. I later found out the opening was done by an American band from Detroit; it&#039;s only gotten better from there.<br />
<br />
For story - <br />
The story of this show is fairly straight forward; a vast array of differing people from all across history and the world (but mostly Japan), are summoned into a parallel universe at the moment of their deaths. Here they must fight likewise summoned enemies to save the world from destruction. This simplicity may bother you, but at the same time the show really doesn&#039;t try to sell itself as anything more, intellectually, than a truly epic &quot;battle in a brand new world war&quot;. Almost like a weirder Lord of the Rings. If you&#039;re looking for intellectual stimulation, you may be disappointed (so far.)<br />
<br />
For Characters - <br />
Most of the characters that have been introduced so far are interesting in their own ways, even if they are a bit flat at first, but they do not fail to intrigue and amuse, particularly as personalities from wildly different eras and cultures clash. I hope that as the series progresses we will get more character depth, but know that with the size of the cast they are juggling and the type of show this is (read epic badass gore-fest with a side of comedy and awesome), this area may be somewhat limited.  One solid negative for the show is the excessively and unnecessarily gay Count St. Gemi<br />
<br />
Final verdict - <br />
I love the show so far, and eagerly await the second season.  Even if only as a adrenaline-spiked thunderously epic bloodbath, Drifters was immensely entertaining and extremely funny, mostly through how seriously its characters take themselves, even when they&#039;re in ridiculous situations - such as fighting medieval nazis with the help of dwarves and elves to overthrow an empire created by drifter Adolf Hitler - cause yes that&#039;s how they roll.<br />
<br />
If you were to hate this show however it would be for one of three reasons:<br />
On the one hand, it could be dragged down by an accumulation of weirdness (see Hitler and his EXTREMELY gay nobles), along with the slapstick Chibi scenes, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s terribly likely.<br />
<br />
Or the lack of in-depth plot and character development might bother you.<br />
<br />
The final danger however I cannot speak of directly, since I promised not to spoil anything, but I will say simply that it pertains to the true identity of &quot;the Black King&quot;, and may end up trashing everything if my suspicion is true and they try to give it any more than passing significance. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s all for now; enjoy the slaughter!<br />
<br />

    Drifters combines various well-known tropes, bringing famous historical figures into a fantasy world, and pitting them against eachother in all-out war. If you don&#039;t like war or watching heads roll, you&#039;re probably in the wrong place.<br />
<br />
The animation is amazing, the soundtrack fits perfectly, the main characters (feudal Japanese warriors) have very well developed personalities, while still staying impressively faithful to how they actually were in history, and the plot illustrates an unabridged version of early-modern Japanese warfare.<br />
Overally, the anime is unbelievably excellent (for its genre, and in production quality); I&#039;m not too keen on the details, but the studio, &quot;Hoods Drifters Studio&quot; appears to have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236913">
        been put together specifically for the production of this anime.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
If anything would quickly turn you away from this anime, it would probably be the art style. You&#039;ll might recognize it from Hellsing; Hirano Kouta just loves silhouettes with one glowing eye and comical polygon forms, among other things, including the characters&#039; facial designs. Aside from that, this anime gets as bloody and gorey as you&#039;d expect to see in war, and doesn&#039;t try to hide it.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
It can get quite chaotic, but it fits the frequent, chaotic battles, and it feels like no effort was spared in bringing these scenes to life; definitely a work of art.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
I can&#039;t express in words how I feel about this anime using a band that can ACTUALLY SPEAK ENGLISH for the OP, but it&#039;s an insanely good feeling. (Also love Kurosaki Maon) The opening and ending were just amazing, and perfectly fit this anime&#039;s romantic depiction of undisguised, hellish war.<br />
<br />
The voice acting... Was mostly good, but it sometimes got too into a character&#039;s particular speech pattern and sounded stale (assuming you&#039;re watching the sub, and that you pay attention to speech patterns).<br />
<br />
Outside of that, certain soundtracks might have been slightly overused, but it&#039;s not too noticeable.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Though some might be disappointed in which historical figures were used, and how influential/amazing they were, remember that it&#039;s Japanese anime, and that the creator is Japanese. I think it was the right choice to focus on the Japanese that are within the writer&#039;s realm of knowledge/expertise. It&#039;s clear that the historic figures used were meant to be faithful to the originals, and the anime includes very accurate references to their knowledge, tactics, and experiences.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it&#039;s quite nice to see an anime that doesn&#039;t bullshit away from actual history (when using historical figures), or bullshit some sort of power that comes from their character (Okay, Drifters does bullshit some powers, but at least they&#039;re less bullshit and make decent sense).<br />
<br />
The only real criticism I have is a lack of characterization for side characters, who are oversimplified, and the ones that aren&#039;t historical figures, who barely get any attention at all. (A bit wasteful towards the fantasy setting, I think)<br />
<br />
Plot:<br />
The anime starts off a bit slow as it introduces the characters, and the &quot;humor&quot; moments can be painful to watch, but it quickly picks up after the 2nd episode. Some people might be bored by the logistics aspect in the anime, but that IS a part of warfare, and personally, I&#039;m glad they don&#039;t leave that out. (It&#039;s like watching someone place their trap card, instead of the trap card appearing out of nowhere)<br />
<br />
The pacing is quite good—it doesn&#039;t try to fill/waste time or contrive stupid cliffhangers or deus ex machinas—because there&#039;s they&#039;re confident that they have enough legitimate, real plot content to keep the audience interested. There&#039;s actually a logical flow to the plot (so far, this season).<br />
<br />
You actually need quite a bit of knowledge of Japanese history, military history, history in general, and Japanese culture to fully understand, notice and appreciate... Tons of things in things, from the characters&#039; behavior, tactics, foreshadowing, to the flow of the plot itself. So yeah, keep that in mind and maybe have google ready.

    Ok, yes, I&#039;m definitely in the minority here, but I REALLY didn&#039;t enjoy this anime. I should&#039;ve seen the signs when it looked like a serious show, but had a &#039;comedy&#039;-tag - a combination that almost never works – but here we are. <br />
For now, I&#039;ll start with the things I liked about this anime... if only because getting through those is a LOT quicker, lol.<br />
<br />
First off, I have to admit, Drifters occasionally had some pretty decent and interesting strategies &amp; tactics in its battles. For example in one instance towards the middle, Nobunaga ordered the elves that they were trying to save to dump

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239522">
        the corpses they had from the fight before into their well and then run before the incoming troops of their enemy arrived. In case you don&#039;t know much about war-tactics: Throwing corpses into a well poisons the water inside, obviously making it undrinkable. This means that troops who want to use the village to refill their supplies and occupy the place can&#039;t do so, as the sole source of water is completely unusable. It&#039;s a standard tactic, aye, but I was still impressed to see it in use, as it showed that whoever made the manga this is based on had at least a basic understanding of war-tactics.<br />
Additionally, I think that the action-scenes themselves were pretty well handled. They weren&#039;t as flashy and clever as JoJo&#039;s nor were they as exciting as Rakudai Kishi&#039;s, but they were definitely better than the action-scenes in the majority of action anime I&#039;ve seen. There was just something about the MC slicing up multiple bad guys that was actually somewhat fun to watch.<br />
<br />
Speaking of &#039;fun to watch&#039;, another thing I actually liked about this show was that it featured an actual Gatling Gun. Yes, I know, that&#039;s a weird thing to be excited about, but Mini-guns (and their ancestors, the Gatling Guns) are amongst the very few guns I actually like and they are almost never get featured in anything, so not only seeing the original GG, but also having it presented rather historically accurate was quite something for me. A very personal point, yes, but I think it still counts.<br />
The last thing I actually liked about this show was its Opening. I&#039;m not exaggerating when I say that this show had one of the coolest openings of the last year. I actually went out of my way to search for the opening on YT to listen to it occasionally, because it&#039;s really that good.<br />
<br />
But that&#039;s where the pleasantries end. If you think that this sounds like a pretty interesting anime based on what you&#039;ve read so far, don&#039;t worry, that&#039;s gonna change in just a minute.<br />
Let&#039;s start with the thing I hated the most about this anime: Its absolutely godawful attempts at Comedy. I&#039;m fking serious. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen an anime where literally every single joke bombed completely. Every single time this anime felt like it was getting too decent, it decided to go into a completely terrible alternative art-style and make some of the characters perform the most tedious boke/tsukkommi routines I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing. Not to mention that even IF the jokes had been successful, they STILL would&#039;ve been out of place, as there&#039;s very few ways to NOT make jokes seem OOP within a serious war setting. I honestly have NO idea why Drifters didn&#039;t just stay serious the entire time, as those were the times where this anime was actually bearable... most of the time.<br />
<br />
The next thing I want to talk about is the Art-style of this show. And I know, I&#039;ve already said how horrible the &#039;joke-art-style&#039; looked, but the one for the serious parts was actually also not something I enjoyed. Yes, it was unique and probably took a lot of effort, but that still doesn&#039;t change the fact that I thought that it looked... sub-par. Maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;m a spoiled KyoAni fanboy, but I really could not get myself to accept the art in this anime. I&#039;ve HEARD that it looks a lot like Hellsing Ultimate (which I can neither confirm nor debunk, as I haven&#039;t watched HU), so I suppose if you&#039;ve liked the art in Hellsing, then you can completely ignore what I just said, lol.<br />
Next up is the character development in this anime... or rather the lack there of. Seriously, the only one with any personality in that bunch seemed to be Nobunaga himself and Saint-Germi. The rest of them seemed to either be one-dimensional warmongers (like the MC himself) or completely lacked any personality or presence whatsoever (like Yoichi Suketaka Nasu, who was part of the main cast... and completely and utterly personality-less.) Probably the most vexing example of a lack of character development was with what might possibly be the main villain: &#039;The Black King.&#039; (one of those titles right out of the &#039;generic villain name&#039;-book). He was shown multiple times over the course of season one, yet I have no fking idea what he&#039;s supposed to be like.<br />
<br />
Which leads us straight into the next point of criticism: the fact that the villain of the series was never characterized whatsoever. It is no secret that it&#039;s tough to hate a villain that you&#039;ve never even seen do anything bad and of whom you&#039;ve only seen a couple glimpses, which is why the most interesting villains are the ones that have a lot of presence like Yoshikage Kira (JoJo) or Handsome Jack (Borderlands 2). Hence it was rather confusing to see that the main villain of this series (who I THINK is the Black King... he&#039;s the only one who even came close to being one at least) was content with just sitting off-screen for the majority of the show, quietly minding his own business and who only did anything at the very end of season one... and even then, he didn&#039;t show up himself , but instead he sent an army of foot soldiers to deal with the army of the protagonists. IMO, that guy was one of the biggest failures of an antagonist I&#039;ve ever seen, rivaling even the teacher from Boku dake ga inai machi.<br />
<br />
This lack of character development COULD&#039;VE been fixed, had they just not thrown in some characters for one, maybe two episodes before never bringing them up again. Seriously, just take a look at the &#039;characters&#039; page of this anime for yourself. It should be obvious that with such a huge cast, it&#039;s impossible to characterize each and every one of them to a satisfying extend, so why did they insist on introducing such a pile of them. For some of them, I don&#039;t even know what their role was supposed to be, because they were introduced as if they were gonna be important, literally did one thing and then fked off into nothingness. Prime example: Zero-pilot Kanno Naoshi. He SEEMED like he could&#039;ve been a really interesting addition to the party, not only because he came from a much more modern era than the rest of the cast but also because he was one of the few people that actually had a character. Which is why his share of screentime still baffles me: he appeared, shot down a dragon, crashed with his plane... and literally the only time he appeared after that was a couple episodes later where he was shown having started living inside of the crashed plane. That was it. I&#039;m still not sure whether he was supposed to be a more important character who just got cut or not.<br />
<br />
The next thing on the chopping block is the cliffhanger ending that this anime had. Because of my attempt to keep things spoiler-free, I&#039;m not gonna go too in-depth, but here&#039;s what I will say: the first season of this anime basically ended with the protagonists and their army getting ready to defeat the Black King, but before literally anything of the sorts actually happened. I hate cliffhanger endings just as much as the next guy, so I am obviously pissed when an anime uses its main antagonist as the sequel-hook. However, seeing as how a 2nd season got confirmed right as the first one ended, I am willing to not see that point as harsh as I would normally.<br />
<br />
Next up, we&#039;ve got the point where I almost dropped the anime outright. In episode 4, the protagonist&#039;s group, supported by the male elves they freed, march towards the castle in which the local bad guy had... basically kidnapped the female population of the elven village. They find out that the women had been locked into the castle&#039;s tower, and upon arriving there, they see that the guards of the castle had been repeatedly raping the elven women. Pretty much the ONLY reason why I didn&#039;t just drop the entire anime at that point (as my very personal opinion is that rape is the one thing that should never be happening) was because I was hoping that the guards would all be killed in the most visceral ways possible in the next episode (which only sorta happened). And before anyone jumps at me to say that &#039;it was obvious&#039; and that &#039;it was a means of making you hate the bad guys&#039;, I would like to point towards an anime that handled a very similar situation (man kidnaps the female population of a settlement and locks them into the giant place he lives in) very differently and a lot &#039;better&#039;: Hitsugi no Chaika. In that show, it basically played out like this: the antagonist of that arc was a man whose &#039;hobby&#039; was to slice up women and he was using the women he kidnapped as his &#039;test subjects&#039;. It was a set-up that was still really effective at making you hate that guy, but it completely avoided making me hate the anime itself. So there you go, there was definitely an alternative way to handle the situation.<br />
<br />
Last up, there are two things I want to talk about about the archery in this anime. I am aware that these are, once again, points that might be completely irrelevant to you, but I still consider them important enough to include.<br />
Firstly: Fire arrows. Jesus fking Christ, when are people finally going to stop using fire arrows in their works if they have NO idea how they work?? If I got 5 cents every time somebody used them completely unrealistically, I could run my own &#039;Say NO to fire arrows&#039; ad-campaign. In Drifters in particular, the fact that they were used this weirdly is even more interesting, as this anime tried to be realistic in its usage of weaponry.<br />
The first time fire arrows showed up in this anime, I was actually somewhat impressed to see that they were used in one of the only two situations where people DID actually use them in the middle ages: during a siege. Sure, the effectiveness of those arrows was still ridiculous (real fire arrows had a chance of ~2% to set something aflame, here it seemed more like 98%), but it was something at least. However, the second time they were used it was back to good ol&#039; &#039;this is NOT how they work. This is not how ANYTHING works&#039;. For some stupid reason, the makers of this thought that it was a reasonable idea to have people use fire arrows... during a horse chase. Which would&#039;ve worked, were it not for two simple things... a) No and b) NO!... but seriously, that part was fking stupid. There was no way for the horse-riders to set their arrows on fire, which means that there was no way to even HAVE fire arrows in that situation... and using them while riding a horse also seems like the best way to get yourself killed, so yeah. Stupid on every single level, which, sadly, seems to be the norm for fire arrows in anything from anime to movies to games. (for further knowledge about fire arrows, watch this &#039;ere: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTd_0FRAwOQ )<br />
<br />
And secondly... Why in the name of god did the professional archer in this anime hold his bow sideways on multiple occasions?? Doing so is pretty much the most sure-fire way to show your enemy that you have NO idea what the fk you&#039;re doing, as you pretty much sacrifice a large portion of your range and power for nothing. Every time the archer-guy held his bow that way, I started to think whether I should laugh or cry about that... and settled for being pissed off.<br />
<br />
All in all: this anime was, all things considered, pretty fking bad in my opinion. My advice would be to just watch the Opening ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQYJxbkEItQ ) until you&#039;re sick of it (which might take a while, as it&#039;s really good) and just give the anime itself a miss. You&#039;ll do yourself a favor.

    Despite others saying that Drifters is overrated and is given to much praise, it still doesn’t change the fact that it easily caught a lot of attention, deriving popularity, and put off a show that greatly satisfies the audience. To be honest, I find the show to be quite a long shot from being a masterpiece but it sure was entertaining in a higher level, and that alone could prove that it deserves what it has now.<br />
<br />
Let’s start with the story. One of the strength of this anime is its interesting background which, aside from using historical facts, combines a very dark theme with concepts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236355">
        of fantasy that stirs up the viewers’ interest. Simply put, the plot is intriguing enough to make someone stick throughout the entire series without a thought of dropping it or even finding it to be boring. On the other hand, I have to point out that despite the eye candy story it is, it actually lacks depth. The show doesn’t really provide too much thought provoking ideas and concepts – it is just entertaining.<br />
<br />
The characters, well, are not something to invest on, not yet. Yes, some of the characters have qualities that well suit the whole concept but somehow, almost all of them are flat characters – lacking depth and not entirely close to real. Their personalities and characteristics are greatly limited to their role – which is to fight. There isn’t much development that happened between the characters throughout the show and there isn’t much background either. Adding to that, the characters were only supporting objects to move the story.<br />
<br />
By this point you may have already thought that Drifters was really that bad and only led to a letdown, but that’s not the case at all. Art. Drifter’s art style is equally the strongest point of this show with its entertainment/enjoyment factor. Even a single glimpse of the show is more than enough to lure you into it. If the story itself is already dark, then it’s not even half of art’s portrayal from the slightest shade of a shadow to the curvature of every evil grin. Of all other anime, the Drifters may have the most accurate embodiment of the story with its visual – if not too much. In terms of the music, I couldn’t say less that it improves the vibe of the show and very well complements with the other elements.<br />
<br />
And now the enjoyment. This is by the most redeeming quality of the show that made it stand out – of course, with the support of the previous elements discussed. Action, action, and more action, that’s basically the surface of this anime but it’s more to it than that. The events of the show is made brilliantly as it does not only give the audience something to decide whether they like it or not but something they will eventually like. That being said, most of the action sequence were made to address a person’s best kept personality or behavior and the anime recognizes them very well. What does that supposed to mean? Well you may notice that a variety of immorality is shown, namely violence, lust, greed and others – but that’s only one way to look at it. The action sequence is also recognizably exemplar with the way everything moves from the inanimate objects to the characters. <br />
<br />
With everything at hand, I have concluded that this anime is not overrated at all and despite its flaws, it still has something to offer and is definitely worthwhile watching. Regardless, more is expected of the show in its upcoming sequel and hopefully this time, it will carefully divert its attention to working on the characters.<br />

    STORY: <br />
Dialogues: Mainly strategic. <br />
Relationships: Comrades. Brotherhood.  <br />
Design: There&#039;s a guy that looked like an office worker working in a cubicle. Except he had his own desk and has the power to send historical figures to another world and change it. He kind of reminds me of the grim reaper. But in his environment involves light. Yet there&#039;s a woman that represents darkness and it turns out she&#039;s responsible for the ends. The ends look like ghosts/evil spirits with dark powers. They are making history in another world and that starts with helping the elves gaining more freedom against their oppressors.  <br />
 <br />
CHARACTERS: <br />
Shimazu Toyohisa: Swordsman/leader, fearless and honourable -- follows

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236875">
        the code of war. Historically, he passed away in 1600 Battle of Sekigahara. <br />
Oda Nobuaga: Battle Strategist, dirty-old man, and kind of reckless. Historically, he was a Warlord who passed away in 1582 by committing suicide.  <br />
Nasu No Yoichi: 19 year old archer. Youngest of 11 siblings. In the past during his era… he was forced to do various inhonourable tasks in the Genpei War, in the new world -- he&#039;s being cautious of it.  <br />
 <br />
OVERALL: <br />
Pros: One of my favourite (TOP 10) animes.  <br />
Cons: More explanation with the office worker- grim reaper guy and the darkness girl! <br />
Theme song: Cool, catchy and the art style of the anime is different too.<br />
<br />
Can&#039;t wait for season 2!! ♥

    This is the type of show for those who want to watch history crossovers (&quot;what if King Arthur fought William Wallace?&quot; sort of thing). I am one of those, or was.<br />
I got to say, Drifters was one of the moderatly anticipated shows of this season. But it could only go so far to prove those expectations true.<br />
<br />
--Plot--<br />
The background plot is a clichéed &quot;person from our world in someone else&#039;s one&quot;. The difference being, all those guys are famous bigwigs over here, all of them got their name in history, and they come from different historical times. So it could be a Western-samurai-WWII with lasers genre

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236273">
        (okay, without lasers, for the time being). It is pretty chaotic by itself, and lots of fun, but could be more well developed. But, as it seems they are going to produce a new season, there is still hope. 6<br />
<br />
--Art--<br />
It sucks. I can only imagine that they did this on purpose to be this bad. But purposely or not, it still sucks. Looks like some 5 year-old&#039;s drawing (okay, good enough for a fiver). The battles get a bit better, but not that much to save this from a 5.<br />
<br />
--Sound--<br />
The OP and ED were captivating, I found myself singing the OP when I was unaware of it. The characters had amazing voice actors, which were emotional when they needed to (which means, almost all the time). Honorable mention to a new language created. It is a shame that the art could not hold a candle to these actors. 8<br />
<br />
--Characters--<br />
They are emotional. Very. Most of the time this show is a screaming hell of people trying to be understood by the loudest-is-best rule. That aside, I found myself really liking the characters, be it good or bad guys. They express emotions, are a tad bit crazy and love to pick a fight. Whatelse could we expect from a crazy show? 8<br />
<br />
--Enjoymeny--<br />
This could be a much better show, if not for the shallow plot (which can get better) and the crappy animation (which won&#039;t get better). I found myself expecting the show every week, hoping for it to start. Seeing the art got me a bit sad but, even so, this is yet a good show. 7<br />
<br />
--Overall--<br />
It gets a new season. As my expectations for the show were a bit high, and failed, this review may get a little biased towards my initial opinion of the show. But it is a good anime for all that matters. If you can deny the animation, this will be lots of fun. If you, like me, cannot, it is still fun.

    Much like a beautifully wrapped Christmas present with a swarm of angry bees inside, Drifters looks fantastic but starts to get a little problematic the second you start trying to unpack it. I will elaborate as to why below, but if you are looking for a straightforward recommendation than in my opinion the good outweighs the bad and it is at the very least an entertaining viewing experience. If you liked Hellsing or other such gory, mindless, high octane romps, you will probably enjoy this too. But if you&#039;re watching it at all critically, you might find some problems.<br />
<br />
Story: Is really pretty fun and engaging.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236642">
        Famous figures from history are taken at the moment before their deaths and thrust into a Tolkien-esque high fantasy world inhabited with elves, dwarves, dragons, and other fantasy staples. And also by humans who, with the exception of one group of fairly annoying individuals who seem thus-far to be a semi-monastic community of stage magicians, are apparently universally racist assholes. The &quot;good&quot; ones among them are called Drifters, the &quot;bad&quot; are called Ends, and they fight each other with a blend of dumb-fun magic and militarily tactics that is very reminiscent of playing Dynasty Warriors. And in case you were wondering, Adolph Hitler is still just as much of a dickhead in any universe in which he finds himself. And there is also a portrait of him that is TERRIFYING!<br />
<br />
Art: Speaking of evocative visual imagery, this show has it in spades. The art design and execution is unequivocally the strongest aspect of the show. Everything is very dark and murky, and it is either washed out and lifeless or vibrant and arresting to suit the mood. The action is great and the character designs all look pretty great.<br />
<br />
Characters: Thank God they all look great, because they are way more of a mixed bag when it comes to their characterization. The main character, Toyohisa, is a cool intense badass samurai, but he is sort of boring in the way that Superman is boring because he is pretty much invulnerable. Of the other two mains Nobunaga is actually pretty great and my favorite character on the show; he is a great blend of funny critique of Nobunaga Oda as historical figure and wacky anime guy in crazy anime world. He is clearly having a great time, which makes him fun to watch. Yoichi, the other (semi)prominent lead, is kind of just an archer who kills things with archery. Cool but vanilla.<br />
<br />
Some of the villains are also pretty interesting in the context of the historical figures they represented. At one point I was like &quot;yeah I guess Joan of Arc might be a little pissed about getting lit on fire.&quot; That was an entertaining tangent. The identity of the main villain will probably piss some people off a whole bunch, but I though it was a pretty neat examination of a controversial historical figure. Most I can say without unnecessary spoilers. <br />
A lot of the side-characters are pretty annoying and problematic, particularly Tits Magee the world&#039;s lamest magician friend who is there to get molested and degraded and the swishy camp gay Count who is a backstabbing, manipulative, rapy, shitdumpster of a person which we know because he is gay.<br />
This character in particular was the perfect example of the biggest problem about the show for me: many of the almost constant jokes fell way flat. This one also managed to fall flat and be remarkably offensive. If he had been funny I would have probably though he was fucking fabulous. He wasn&#039;t. Instead we are just left with almost direct quote that because something is inherently wrong with homosexuals as people, it makes them A.) Want to fuck each other, and B.) be awful, awful people. Not as part of a joke. Just as a statement. That was pretty icky to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
All in all, this show feels OLD. The jokes feel old, the story is about olden times, the main cast is markedly older than the majority of anime casts, and the target audience appears to be people who like Tolkien but also really enjoy reading world history textbooks in their spare time (which is, I guess, kinda me). If you catch all the references to history, you might think its pretty funny at times. Otherwise you&#039;ll just think it looks good and has cool action. It does. Watch it if that&#039;s all you care about. I enjoyed it despite it pissing me off, albeit infrequently.

    Drifters is a fantasy, alternate history series adapted from a manga of the same name, written and illustrated by Kouta Hirano, who’s the original creator of the Hellsing series. It is directed by Suzuki Kenichi, who’s directed such anime as Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. One can tell that the series would involve nothing short of brutal, stylized action and Drifters meets this expectation. However, it offers a lot more than that.<br />
<br />
[A different take on the ‘Isekai’ sub-genre]<br />
<br />
The Japanese word ‘isekai’ can be translated directly to mean ‘different world’ and is a sub-genre of fantasy series that involves one or many characters transported to another world, often

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236659">
        through magical means. The plot of such series revolves around the characters’ struggles as they try to leave the world which is unfamiliar to them; a typical human reaction. From the first few scenes, Drifters is immediately identified as a fantasy show of the ‘Isekai’ sub-genre as the main characters is sent into a stock fantasy world, replete with demi-humans like elves. But the similarities end there.<br />
<br />
There are a few stark differences between the nature of the ‘passengers’, the ones being transported, in Drifters and the ones in regular ‘Isekai’ shows. One of the easiest differences to spot is that the Drifters are historical characters unlike the more modern protagonists in regular ‘Isekai’. Another key difference are the ages and statuses of the Drifters. Where most Isekai shows involve young adults, usually high-schoolers, lacking in essential more survival experience, the Drifters are full-fledged adults and warriors who’ve survived many battles. This attribute of the Drifters (and the Ends who’re the series antagonists), leads to the most profound difference between the series and a regular ‘Isekai’: the characters do not seek to escape the different world. They seek to conquer it.<br />
<br />
As early as the first episode, the primary Drifters, composed of Oda Nobunaga, Shimazu Toyohisa and Nasu Yoichi, begin working on plans to challenge the human Empire of Orte, the current government. On the other end, the Ends advance their army against the same Empire for the purpose of liberating all monsters in the alternate world. There is little talk of escape; instead, the Drifters utilize their knowledge and experience to transform the alternate world. Not only do they shake up the government, but they introduce warfare as they’ve experienced it. This change is made possible due to the strength of the characters.<br />
<br />
[Stock action characters with the rare exceptions]<br />
<br />
It’s easy to dismiss the Drifters  (and Ends) as the stock, one-dimensional characters often found in action shows; the characters fill out archetypal roles and march towards their respective goals with a trail of epic battles in their wake. This is not necessarily a bad thing as it often makes for exciting shows and Drifters is no exception. Drifters does try to make its characters more interesting by giving them additional attributes with weak relations to their main skills. Toyohisa is the mindless warrior who only seeks to remove his enemy’s head at any cost but will uphold the warrior code of his time. Yoichi is the quintessential archer who’s courageous enough to fight in the open if need be. Nobunaga is the brilliant mastermind who fawns over future technology. The supporting characters and the Ends simply play out their roles with the exception of Olminu who begins as a wide-eyed junior magician from the Octobrists but grows into a brilliant support for the Drifters.<br />
<br />
One major issue with the characters in Drifters is the screen time given some of the supporting cast and the Ends. The Ends are only seen during seen during their encounters with the Drifters and in a few brief moments. An improvement would have been to have some development of the Ends during the moments when the Drifters prepare for battle and in lieu of the comedy (which I’ll get to later). The mysterious characters of Murasaki and Easy who’re responsible for transporting the Drifters and Ends to the world are virtually invisible in the show. It’s understandable that the overall runtime for the show makes it difficult to develop most of the characters equally.<br />
<br />
[Gritty, stylized art]<br />
<br />
From the first scene, we’re introduced to the gritty art that fuels Drifters take on Isekai. The characters and background are done in dark, desaturated colours that are in sharp contrast to the usual colourful scenes of fantasy shows; the blood has a dark red sheen and has fluid animation. The characters look grim and constantly wear a serious look even when they’re smiling. The show doesn’t hold back on its style.<br />
<br />
A remarkable aspect to the art of Drifters is the character design, both for the historical characters and the indigenes of the world. Their representations were accurate for the most part with a few additions. I especially liked Nobunaga’s design because of the eyepatch which made him stand out. The indigenes are designed as would characters in a medieval fantasy setting with the exception of the Octobrists, who have unique attires.<br />
<br />
A major gripe I had with the character art is that they had similar faces and expressions. This was especially noticed in the males; they all seemed to have the same soulless eyes and menacing smile.<br />
<br />
[Forgettable soundtrack]<br />
<br />
The music of Drifters was a major miss for me as there weren’t any memorable soundtracks despite the numerous battle scenes. And whatever soundtracks played were often drowned out by the screaming characters. On the other hand, I enjoyed the opening theme a lot and often sang along. The ending theme wasn’t as inspirational.<br />
<br />
[Dreadful comedy]<br />
Drifters is a thoroughly enjoyable show and was one of my favourites for the fall season of 2016. My bias towards the fantasy genre made it a must-watch but it exceeded my expectations with its  interesting characters and their lofty ambition to rule their world instead of escape it. The use of historical characters had me returning to Wikipedia with each introduction, helping me pick up a bit of Japanese history (mostly). The art was a refreshing change from the cute, fluffy and colourful art of the various ‘otome’ shows during the season. These great aspects of the show helped offset the forgettable music and the awful comedy. The comedy in Drifters starts out as horrible and often interrupted the better moments of the show. The change in art style coupled with the dry jokes were huge misses. But I soon got used to it and sometimes welcomed it as it showed another side to the characters. Perhaps it was because most of the comedy concerned Nobunaga, who was my favourite character. It was a part of the show I can’t say I completely enjoyed.<br />
<br />
If you’re a fan of fantasy shows, I would recommend Drifters, if only for the interesting plot and art style.

    Drifters is a science fiction, fantasy action, adventure manga written by Hirano Kouta. You may know him as the writer of Hellsing. At the tail end of 2016, an anime adaptation of Drifters aired. It was brought to us by Hoods Entertainment. A studio that I&#039;ve never reviewed an anime by before. So, is Drifters a series that&#039;s worth looking into? <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
After the battle of Sekigahara, Shimazu Toyohisa finds himself in a strange, light corridor filled with doors. A spectacled man gestures and he gets pulled into one of them and directly into another world. He finds himself meeting Oda Nobunaga and Nasu Yoichi, two

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241686">
        men who were recorded as having died before his time. It turns out that in this world of elves, dwarves, halflings and men, certain people from our world are being sent just before their deaths by the spectacled fellow in an effort to preserve the world from beings called “Ends,” who are also comprised of famous figures from our world, and their Black King. Shimazu and his new found companions, unaware of the ends and their threat, decide to lead a rebellion to save the elves from their forced servitude by a large, human nation. <br />
<br />
The biggest flaw with the series goes back to our old friend, tone. This is one of those series that, in one vein, has really over the top violence and humour and, in an entirely different vein, tries to tackle some serious subject matter. Notably rape. Consequently, its handling these serious subjects for all of five minutes before going back to the absurdity and never mentioning them again comes across as more than a little tasteless. Although, in all fairness, there are only a few scenes like that. The ending is also pretty unsatisfying. It&#039;s all setting up for the next series and, while it does have a degree of closure for one of the major plot threads, it doesn&#039;t even bother giving you a climactic battle with any finality. For that matter, there&#039;s very little aftermath. Certainly not enough to give us as the viewers a sense of what came from the whole thing beyond the very obvious.<br />
<br />
On the positive side, I do like the concept of two opposing entities each scouring our history for  figures they can use against one another. The series also does quite well when it&#039;s staying in its comfort zone of over the top violence mixed with humour. It also does do a good job at keeping your interest since it has a lot of interwoven plot threads. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s discuss a very mixed element with the series. The fluctuating complexity. We see our protagonists face the Orte Empire, a very uncomplex fascist nation. Right down to being founded by one of history&#039;s most brutal monsters. They also face the Ends, who are heavily indicated to have more going for them than the initial impression indicates. We also  have the Count of Saint Germain. Initially, he appears to be the gay stereotype that seems to pop up in anime because “he&#039;s gay it&#039;s funny.” However, there are several ways in which he goes beyond that and becomes a surprisingly complex character. And the anime is full of elements that seem shallow but get built on into something more and others that are just shallow<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The characters, at this juncture, are more potentially complex than they are actually complex. There are some, our main trio of heroes and the Count, who move beyond their archetypes in some ways. There are other Drifters and several characters among the Ends with potential, usually due to some connection with our heroes, but without anything tangible yet. The characters who are neither are just universally bland. Including the Count&#039;s subordinates who are just the gay stereotypes. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
This is a bit mixed mainly because there are two art styles in the series. There&#039;s the “comedic” art style, which looks lazily rushed and like the artists just didn&#039;t care. Then there&#039;s the art style they use the rest of the time and it actually does look pretty great. The action sequences are fluid and intense. The character designs are detailed, although it should be noted that, in a bout of uncreative nonsense, the elves all look very similar as do the members of certain other fantasy races. The backgrounds are very nicely detailed under the normal style and basically non-existent with the comedic. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The acting is similar to the art in that it has two modes. There&#039;s the over the top comedic mode where everyone sounds like seven year olds shouting the lines of their school play and there&#039;s the regular mode which sounds pretty good. Nakamura Yuuichi, Uchida Naoya &amp; Saiga Mitsuki all do very well at those points. The music was composed by Ishii Yasushi and Matsuo Hayato. Matsuo also worked on music for the first series of JoJo and Magic Knight Rayearth. All in all, it&#039;s all right. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
Aside from Germain and his companions, there&#039;s a unit of muscular gay guys. Several men express attraction to Yoichi and there&#039;s one line that may hint that Anastasia has a thing for Jeanne. It&#039;s ambiguous. <br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
So, how does Drifters hold up when you factor in its good ideas with what it executes well, its tonal problems, its vast gaps in quality for both the art and voice acting, its inconsistent complexity and all of that? Well, I would say it&#039;s all right. Honestly, it had the potential to be really good. For that matter, it could pretty easily become something really good, but as is, the first series has quite a few issues that hold it back. If you like the concept, you can handle the dip in quality for the big comedic bits and you can forgive the occasional tonal awkwardness, you might enjoy it. For myself, I&#039;ll give it a 6/10. Next week I&#039;ll look at Karas.

    So, this is an anime where Hitler is fighting against god. The review will contain a few spoilers, but nothing groundbreaking.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
The story is about great warriors from different time eras, that died in their last battle and are now coming to a new world full of fantasy creatures like Elves, Dwarves, Goblins, Zombies, Dragons and much more. Supposedly their purpose in this world is to fight against &quot;The Ends&quot;, which are the &quot;bad&quot; creatures in every fantasy story: zombies, dragons, piglins, goblins and the supreme leader, who is non surprisingly a Mage. So our heroes are supposed to defeat them, it&#039;s not their duty,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review348916">
        but if they don&#039;t do it, sooner or later they will die and after all, they are heroes, it&#039;s their job to save the weaker ones.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The art is interesting. It really reminds me of  Hellsing, maybe, just maybe because it was made by the same studio that made Hellsing. Yea that&#039;s pretty much it. The animation is good with a lot of gore, characters designs are really good and beautiful.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
To be honest I didn&#039;t find anything special in the OST. The music was good and all, but I didn&#039;t find any piece that I would listen to weekly or even daily. I noticed that they used some classical music at some parts, but honestly, that&#039;s all I can remember.<br />
<br />
Characters: 9<br />
There was a diverse collection of characters. Even the side characters were interesting to learn about. And let&#039;s not talk about the main characters. In the official wiki, there are 3 main characters, but for me, every drifter Is a main character. They have different personalities(no shit) and understanding of the world and war because they are all from different eras. We have a samurai, cowboys, pirate, the leader of the fucking Japanese army or something I am bad with memory, a modern aristocrat and I think 2 emperors, one of Rome and the other I don&#039;t know. The samurai has a fetish for heads I guess, the pirate is a great strategist, the cowboys are just cowboys you know... And so on and so on. <br />
<br />
A little spoiler ahead<br />
The creator of the human empire is fucking Hitler goddammit. And I think the leader of the Ends, is Jesus Christ, but don&#039;t quote me on that.<br />
End of spoilers<br />
<br />
Overall the characters are great to learn about and interesting to watch.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
I really enjoyed the show. It had its great battles and peaceful moments. Of course, there were some moments where I kinda got bored, but 10 minutes later my interest was back to a 100. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
The show is missing some components. The story could be better in my opinion. The art is great, but the animation could be a tiny bit better. As I already said, there wasn&#039;t anything really special about the sound, but this doesn&#039;t mean it was bad, it just wasn&#039;t anything special. The characters are amazing and to be honest, I could give them a 10, but I decided to leave it a 9. I really enjoyed the show and I would recommend it to anyone that has some interest in isekai, war or action overall. Forgot to mention it is really really gory, which is a good thing for me, but some people may not like gore so it&#039;s up to you.<br />

    The concept of Drifters showed a lot of promising potential, but yet again the potential is ruined by it being too centered around Japan and the Japanese. If the plot was changed especially in regards to the amount of drifters and who the drifters were it could easily have been a great show if not a masterpiece. <br />
<br />
The plots real weakness lies in the lack of Drifters, the problem in and of itself or rather the potential being wasted is most likely due to the author of Drifters being far too centered on Japan and Japanese history while being less knowledgeable about non-Japanese history which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306397">
        is why characters outside of Japan are lacking to say the least. I would list tons of generals, commanders, kings and so on that I think would have been amazing additions to make Drifters an exciting anime, but the list would simply be too long. Even if we skip all the lesser known generals there are an abundance of famous ones that are simply left out which in my opinion is a complete and utter waste. <br />
<br />
Short lift of possible additions; Timur, Genghis Khan, Alexander the great, Julius Caesar, Attila the hun, Qin Shi Huang, Charlemagne, Saladin, Suleiman the magnificent, Wu Qi and Napoleon<br />
<br />
Just by seeing these names most people will know the amount of potential wasted by simply leaving them out of the story. Naoshi Kanno was also used, but if you were to use a ww2 pilot that died during ww2 one of the optimal choices would be Otto Kittel which scored a total of 267 aerial victories meaning he&#039;s one of the most successful fighter pilots in history compared to Kannos 25. If you absolutely wanted a Japanese fighter pilot that died during ww2 your obvious choice would be Hiromichi Shinohara which sat Japanese records having shot down 11 planes in a single day, author please. <br />
<br />
Onto a minor issue is regarding to the portrayal of certain characters and Rasputin is by far the most obvious. If you saw a picture of Rasputin in drifters and you were asked which historical figure it is there&#039;s no fucking way anyone would ever guess Rasputin apart from getting it on a wild guess. Surely the Japanese can&#039;t hate beards so much to the extent that they&#039;re unwilling to create fully bearded characters.<br />
<br />
The last matter would be the personality of the characters themselves. Digging deeper into history and figure out what kind of people they truly were and how they acted would have been better in addition to something that would have made it possible for all of them to communicate with each other efficiently. Some lines in foreign languages wouldn&#039;t have been a bad thing either if they managed to get the voice actors to actually pronounce foreign languages properly. <br />
<br />
Although the story in and of itself is an isekai I also believe it would have been much better without magic. Seeing a contest of raw skill and strategy between famed generals throughout history would have been a much better option. Although the combat still would have been in the realms of fantasy it would have been much better this way. <br />
<br />
So in the end the story ends up at a wasted potential/10<br />
<br />
The art and sound were both fine, although you can clearly see the similarity to Hellsing as the author is the same, but I don&#039;t think the art fits as well with Drifters as it did with Hellsing.<br />
<br />
Massively wasted potential/10
