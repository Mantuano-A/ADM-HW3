    When I first started watching Plastic Memories back in April I was immediately very impressed by it because the first episode was simply amazing. It forecasted an original anime with beautiful artwork, an ambient atmosphere, likeable characters and a lot of tragic drama. At the time, I really thought that it would become the next hidden gem, and the biggest surprise of the season.<br />
<br />
As it turned out however, Plastic Memories instead ended up being one of the most misleading anime I&#039;ve seen in quite some time. Unlike what the opening seemed to imply, in reality the show is mostly a cute and light-hearted slice of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191465">
        life comedy with quite a lot of romance in it. Now this doesn&#039;t mean the anime turned out poorly in the end, quite the opposite in fact, but it never reached the level that I thought it would have reached in the beginning.<br />

The story takes place in a future world where humanoid androids are a common part of human society. The androids, named &quot;Giftias&quot;, are fully equipped with human emotions, and help their respective human owners however possible. But the Giftias have very limited lifespans, and thus they need to be taken out of commission before too long. Enter Tsukasa, an 18-year-old boy whom is offered a position at the SAI Corporation; a group responsible for retrieving Giftias who are approaching the ends of their lifespans, and eventually scrap them. Right next to him, we have his fellow co-worker: the incredibly cute and loveable Isla, who is actually a Giftia herself despite her position. The two of them form a team by order of their boss, and they consequently start working together, socializing together, and of course fall in love with each other.<br />
<br />
This is how Plastic Memories suddenly becomes something totally different from what it originally promised to be. Despite the premise, the anime is in fact not about the retrieval of various Giftias, nor is it about the SAI Corporation itself or any of the other people working there. Plastic Memories is about Tsukasa, and it is about Isla. That is all. And honestly, that&#039;s totally fine in and of itself because they make up one of the cutest couples I&#039;ve seen in ages, and watching their awkward romance is surprisingly enjoyable no matter how much you see of it. But for a lot of people, this was nothing more than wasted potential because the cool and interesting premise of the story itself is heavily neglected in the process. For everyone who wanted to see a melancholic story about the tragedy of having to say goodbye to your loved ones and how they deal with it... you&#039;re probably going to be left disappointed, because Plastic Memories doesn&#039;t actually focus very much on that at all other than right at the very beginning. The only character the show ever really emphasizes this point for is Isla herself as her lifespan is of course also very limited due to being a Giftia, but for everyone else... not very much.<br />
<br />
However if you can get past the fact that the show is more or less in disguise and try to see it for what it actually is (in other words a romantic slice of life story), then suddenly Plastic Memories is a very enjoyable anime again. Why? Because it actually has *proper romantic development*. Quite a lot of it in fact. This is not the kind of show which ends with a confession in the final episode and nothing more; no, there are actually things happening from very early on in a romantic sense, which is something that is unfortunately very rare in today&#039;s anime. Especially seeing Plastic Memories airing in the same season as Nisekoi was pretty amusing to me; they&#039;re like night and day in comparison as far romantic progression goes.<br />
<br />
Overall, Plastic Memories is an anime which you will probably be given a very different impression of depending on your expectations on it. Is it a good anime? Yes, but it&#039;s a completely different anime from what you&#039;re most likely anticipating when you start watching it. That doesn&#039;t make it a bad show per se, but it feels a bit like false marketing. It&#039;s up to each and every viewer to do their best at adapting to what the anime has to offer.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a deeply touching and emotional melodrama like Clannad: After Story or Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, then sorry to say but you&#039;re looking in the wrong place. But for a cute yet beautiful story about young love, it&#039;s hard to find a better example than Plastic Memories.

    Human/technology integration has always been a fascinating topic to me. Just thinking of humanity&#039;s next leap towards further development being aided by biomechanical intervention could cause even the cynical-minded to wax philosophical. It&#039;s a topic that&#039;s inspired countless debate and discussion for many; redefining the idea of what it means to be human with the continuously blurred line between man and machine. And what better way to view this delicate balancing act than by seeing it unfold through the guise of a romance. It&#039;s an interesting &quot;what if&quot; scenario, that, to those who share my fascination with the subject, could find many interesting facets on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192427">
        exploring that very idea. <br />
Can such a nebulous idea of &quot;true love&quot; be found with a man-made being? Where do we draw the line between augmented reality and primal attraction? Many different forms of media have tried to tackle this intriguing concept; from movies like 2013&#039;s &quot;Her&quot; and 2015&#039;s &quot;Ex Machina,&quot; to novels like Jonathan Lethem&#039;s &quot;As She Climbed Across the Table.&quot; There are even a few anime titles that tackled this subject as well, such as Eve No Jikan, Armitage III, Chobits and many others. When this topic is done right, it can be a highly rewarding experience, leaving the viewer with something to wrap their heads around.<br />
So when I sat down to watch Plastic Memories, a show that had the right ingredients to make something truly thought provoking, just flush this potential down the toilet, for what essentially was forced melodrama... let&#039;s just say I wasn&#039;t a happy camper when everything was said and done. Under normal circumstances, I would categorize shows with Plastic Memories&#039;s setup as a bait-and-switch, but from the way it was presented, it never seemed to care about, or even acknowledge the ideas it could have implemented. What we have here instead was a cookie cutter rom-com that was oblivious to its own potential.<br />
<br />
So no, I didn&#039;t get what I wanted, but does that render the rom-com that took its place bad?... Unfortunately yes, it does. It&#039;s a show that forces a catch-22 on the audience with an inevitable conclusion spurred on by contrived logistics. It suffered from heavy-handed manipulation at the cost of proper buildup and engagement, which was made all the more noticeable when you take into consideration the setting the show presents everything in. <br />
In the future, sentient androids known as &quot;Giftias&quot; has become incorporated into everyday society. However, like everything else that has a beginning, so too does the Giftias have a limited lifespan as well, with about a decade or so of functionality before they are decommissioned, resulting in their memories being erased (which is the android&#039;s equivalency of death). This, of course, becomes the core focus of the show, as we&#039;re introduced to our protagonist Tsukasa, a human, who finds himself involved with one of these Giftias named Isla. And from there onward, the show chronicles their daily interaction and growing relationship. And as you would guess, it becomes a tale of a fleeting would-be romance with only one possible outcome.<br />
<br />
When trying to present a romance, there must be proper interaction between the main love interests in order to sell their position as lovers. We as viewers need to see this bond slowly form, see the chemistry that they share, and the mannerisms that they portray when expressing themselves to each other. To get down to brass tacks, we as viewers need to be convinced of their validity as a couple for it to feel organic. If this isn&#039;t handled properly, it can cause the relationship and development to feel forced or manipulated. This is Plastic Memories 1st noticeable blunder. It tries to build this chemistry on a premise that just screams victimizing; with a character predestined to be terminated from an expiration date, a protagonist that makes no visible effort in repealing the outcome, and a romance bound to go nowhere because of it. It isn&#039;t bittersweet nor is it heart-wrenching since the reason these androids expire is contrived and contradictory to the world setting presented. How may you ask? Well, let&#039;s explore the ill-defined logic the show tries to spoon feed us.<br />
<br />
We&#039;re made to believe that this show takes place in a future where the creation and distribution of androids are a fairly commonplace occurrence. In other words, it&#039;s an advance society that&#039;s leagues ahead of us in terms of technological breakthrough and scientific advancement. But at the same time, the show wants us to believe that they have no methods of storing or switching memory from one device to another. And I shouldn&#039;t have to spell it out but do you see how this nonsensical explanation doesn&#039;t work? A society advance enough to have androids with empathy, but not advance enough to store memory or transfer it? So if you own a USB flash drive, then congrats, you&#039;ve officially surpassed this society&#039;s current intellect. And that is just the tip of the iceberg when talking about this show&#039;s implausible setting. Later on, we find out that after an android passes its expiration date and isn&#039;t decommissioned, they take on a savage state, becoming dangerously violent against humans, escalating to the point of murder  (in other words, they go ape-shit). Which begs the question, why in the hell would anyone endorse a machine that can go &quot;Terminator&quot; on citizens when they lose their memory? It&#039;s unfathomable to think any governing body with a modicum of common sense would allow such a hazardous time bomb to be integrated into society. There was even an episode dedicated to showing how such a terrible downside could reek havoc, or even worse, be exploited as a weapon, but like the setting it&#039;s a part of, it was never explored beyond that. It was simply brought up and never mentioned again by the next episode just so they could allow for more rom-com moments to continue undisturbed. Just look out for the &#039;Psycho-Pass&#039; episode, you&#039;ll know it when you see it. <br />
<br />
Tsukasa and Isla both work at the same job, and it&#039;s also the place they 1st make contact with each other. From what you can easily read in the synopsis, they both work for the Terminal Service Department: a subdivision of the larger company responsible for the distribution and recall of androids. They&#039;re tasked with retrieving androids that are approaching their expected expiration date from their owners. This, of course, brings up yet another question; why is the task of retrieving androids so primitive and counterproductive? Like I&#039;ve stated, these androids are like ticking time bombs with the added bonus of being empathetic. You would think something as important as this would be tasked to a more organized unit, but what we&#039;re introduced to instead is a motley crew of quirky characters that only share one personality trait and act so outlandish that entrusting them with such a task is almost ludicrous. It&#039;s like handing police duty over to the circus. It&#039;s like the creators were dead-set on an end goal and didn&#039;t care how little sense it made getting there. On a whole, the sci-fi elements of this show were never explored or utilized. It was simply used for flavoring, and it quickly became apparent that they didn&#039;t care about common sense when they duct-taped the narrative and setting together.<br />
<br />
The relationship was also diminished by the fact that 3/4ths of the show&#039;s run-time were dedicated to slapstick comedy and silly misunderstandings. Half of it was wasted away where it could have been used to develop the relationship between the characters, which was made even worse given the short episode count the show was already working with. While I&#039;m not the biggest fan of shows like Clannad or Toradora, I at least acknowledge that it did this aspect correctly. It utilized its run-time by building the relationship between the characters, either by their direct contact with each other or the indirect result of their influence on each other. It allowed us as an audience to grow attached to their interaction and relationship.<br />
<br />
Most of the characters, like I&#039;ve already stated, are just a range of archetypes. From your tsunderes to your beta-male, they all follow one-note traits and won&#039;t be remembered for anything else. This also applies to our two main characters. Tsukasa is as generic as a protagonist can get, ripped right out of the pages of cliché-land. You&#039;ve seen his type many times before, and to be quite frank about it, he&#039;s indistinguishable from the lot of them. Isla is yet another Rei Ayanami clone, completely packaged with the silver hair, red eyes, and the signature porcelain complexion. Dull, monotone and devoid of personality, the only good thing I can say about her is that she truly acts like an android. Outside of the main cast, we&#039;re occasionally introduced to androids and their masters that the team has to retrieve. But they&#039;re introduction is done more so for forced &quot;feels&quot; than for actual world building. Just toss in a sappy backstory and an unavoidable conclusion and it really becomes more annoying than anything. <br />
<br />
And really, that&#039;s the main problem with this show in a nutshell: it&#039;s constantly trying to get the audience to care but doesn&#039;t seem to have any idea how to do so without coming across as fake. It&#039;s a show that forcefully tugs at your heart strings while thinking that people will easily be duped into falling for it. It thinks that simply playing melancholic music and animating tear ducts is more than enough to fool viewers, while forgetting that genuine character investment is what allows the audience to sympathize with hardships. And who knows, maybe this falsehood would fool some into buying the creator&#039;s snake oil. There are certainly viewers out there willing to suspend their disbelief, regardless of the amount of mental gymnastics required to do so. But for those well-versed enough to see past the smoke and mirrors, it&#039;s a detracting quality that causes the show and its conflict to implode on itself. <br />
<br />
The art and animation for Plastic Memories were above average and made the whole experience better than it would have been without it. It was bright, vivid and used a broad range of color palettes to convey whatever mood or tone they were going for. While it felt overdone at times, there were moments where it truly shined and help to sell the scene at hand; most notably the show&#039;s finale episodes and epilog. While the art and animation served their purpose, the character designs were a hit or miss. On one hand, a few had distinct features about them, but a lot were also cookie-cutter in a bad way as well. It helps to better personify their characteristics, but when they lack dimension and personality, it made them feel like carbon copies of other characters in the same vein as them. There was also moments where the show paid direct homage to Evangelion with certain scenes and shot compositions, which, while being a fun little tribute, didn&#039;t serve any purpose whatsoever. At best, they were Easter eggs for those that caught on to them. <br />
The soundtrack was a mixture of pop and electronica flavoring. It was &quot;fluffy&quot; during the comedic bits and took on a more somber tone during the show&#039;s more &quot;emotional&quot; moments. While there weren&#039;t any noteworthy tracks, it was fine and served its purpose. Average but effective. The opening and ending themes were both fine and easy listens. Nothing that might stick with you but catchy and worked in unison with the show.<br />
<br />
Like most titles of this nature, my problem doesn&#039;t stem from what it&#039;s trying to do, my problem comes from how poorly it goes about attempting it. If a show is aiming to get me as a viewer, emotionally invested, I expect it to do so in a manner that doesn&#039;t distract from its target intent. If I&#039;m duped and fall for it, despite my better knowledge of its intent, I will credit it for its efforts. However, if I&#039;m viewing the show and have to signal the &quot;bullshit&quot; flag every other minute, then as far as I&#039;m concerned, that anime failed at its job. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4/10<br />
<br />
My enjoyment of Plastic Memories was intermittent at best, but for the most part, the show was a face-palming experience. Because of the sloppy portrayal of its themes and forced melodrama, there was no engagement to speak of. The ending was decent, but the journey to said ending was buffoonish at best and can&#039;t be overlooked. <br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10<br />
<br />
Plastic Memories was an uninspired and underwhelming experience. It had the opportunity to craft a decent romance, or even better, a good sci-fi tale, but it did neither and ended up falling short of the mark. While some might find it touching, I simply couldn&#039;t buy into the dilemma for the reasons I&#039;ve stated. If you decide to watch this show, do so with low expectations, for whatever it tried to do, have been done to a much higher and better degree somewhere else.

    **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**<br />
<br />
While Plastic Memories had the potential to be a unique and intelligent show, it instead managed to encompass all of the things that ruin dramas and cause them to fail every time. Forced plot devices that make no sense? Check. Inopportune comedy that ruins the show’s tone? Check. Shallow characters defined entirely by their archetypes or tragic backstories? Check. While this anime showed flashes of good ideas and has its moments, its poor execution dooms it to be lost among the sea of poorly written, mediocre emotion porn.<br />
<br />
Synopsis: In the near future, technology has allowed for the invention humanoid-like robots known as “giftias”,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191607">
        who look, talk, feel, and emote exactly like actual humans do. The catch is that they can only operate for a little over a decade before they must be shut down, resulting in the loss of all their memories. The story follows Tsukasa, a human, and his relationship with Isla, a giftia.<br />
<br />
The biggest and most obvious problems with this anime stem from its forced and melodramatic plot devices that range from just plain stupid to cringeworthy. For example, when Tsukasa and Isla first become partners at work, we are suddenly told that this means they have no choice but to live together! Because that makes total sense and is definitely not a lazy plot device to provide a setup for bonding and slice of life shenanigans! The other one that sticks out is the big “reveal” they make about what happens to giftias if they aren’t properly retrieved, which defies all notions of common sense and even basic science. That’s especially bad given that this show has a science-fiction setting for some reason. In fact… was there ANY reason for there to be robots in the first place? Literally the only difference between a human and a giftia is that giftias lose their memories after a certain period of time, so now that I think about it, that makes the entire sci-fi setting and concept of giftias in general completely pointless and nothing more than yet another contrived plot device for drama’s sake. They certainly didn’t explore any sort of difference between the two life forms; it’s very much an accepted fact that giftias are equal to humans, so why was everyone not just regular people to begin with? Was there no other scenario they could come with that incorporated death-like elements, like, y’know, DEATH? It’s this kind of thing that makes the show very difficult to take seriously.<br />
<br />
There are other major issues with the show’s plot, namely how laughably predictable it is. You can LITERALLY guess every major plot point of the entire show by the end of the first episode, and I’m not exaggerating, because I literally did. I just kept waiting and waiting for something that I didn’t see coming a mile away to happen, and with the exception of a single contrived plot device which I already mentioned (a plot device that doesn’t even lead to anything…), it simply never does. Now, one thing that I will give the show credit for is that is has some genuinely sweet moments. The final stretch of the show made me feel something, at least. However, then it just sort of… ends. And it ends, like, EXACTLY how you would expect it to. I guess what I’m trying to get at here is that it left me with a feeling of “So what?” I mean, you told one of the most obvious and straightforward stories I’ve ever seen, so much so that I could have stopped watching after a single episode and gotten the gist of it, so what did you put into your show that justified the time it took to watch another 12 episodes? Were there any meaningful themes? No. Did the characters learn anything or change in any meaningful way? No. So why would anyone EVER want to watch the entirety of this show? *Sigh, I don’t know if this is making sense. Let’s just move on:<br />
<br />
The last aspect of the plot that really bothered me was the random comedy that completely ruined the show’s tone by being interspersed throughout parts that are supposed to be serious. To give an example, the first episode of this show really hooked me. At the very end of the episode, there was a well-executed and genuinely emotional scene that was actually getting to me. I’m the kind of person who almost never gets legitimately emotional when watching a TV show, but this one scene was just hitting all the right notes for me. By the time it was over, I thought we had an extremely promising show on our hands. Now, guess what this beautiful, emotional scenario was immediately followed by: …A BATHROOM JOKE. That’s right. No relevance, no context. They just decided to throw in a random bathroom joke and ended the episode on a ridiculous note instead of a serious and powerful one. That, to me, is a decent microcosm of the entire show. Every time you might be about to get invested in a serious scene, WHAM! Random, generic, slice-of-life comedy comes out of nowhere and blindsides the plot. It’s just a disastrous display of a lack of tonal understanding and, ergo, bad writing. <br />
<br />
I think the real thing that would have saved Plastic Memories for me was if the characters were given any form of depth whatsoever. Tsukasa, our protagonist, is a cardboard cutout straight from the generic, beta, male protagonists factory. My god, there was, nothing, NOTHING unique about him. I don’t think I’m alone in the sediment that I don’t care about other people’s relationships if I don’t know them, and I certainly didn’t feel like I knew Tsukasa, so how am I supposed to give a damn about him and Isla’s relationship? Speaking of Isla, talk about yet another shallow character. I put her squarely in the mary-sue category, given that she is an idealization of a pure, innocent, kawaii waifu with no real flaws whatsoever. Can she be funny at times? Sure. Does that mean I at all cared about her? No. As for the side characters? Boring. Bland. Generic. They are all basic stereotypes with nothing to distinguish them. I know they attempt to give a few of the side characters a backstory, but the backstories don’t actually accomplish anything other than just being sad. They do absolutely nothing to add a dimension to the character they are attached to and none of them are given any form of a story arc. I’ve seen casts like this a million times. The characters, to me, might be the biggest reason the show failed. I might have been able to overlook all the previously mentioned problems with the plot if this show actually gave me a reason to care about the couple of Tsukasa and Isla, but they simply don’t.<br />
<br />
Pretty much the only thing I can definitively say I liked about Plastic Memories was the animation. It’s pretty fluid, but what really got me was the cinematography and shot composition. Besides the number of Evangelion references they threw in, there were a lot of well thought out and extremely well directed scenes that actually succeeded in conveying information and emotion without words. That’s VERY difficult for a show to do, so kudos for that. The settings were always detailed and full of bright colors as well. The world looked really cool, which is part of the reason I wanted them to actually tell me something about it. Like, literally anything would have been nice. Instead, the writing is so barebones that it could have taken place pretty much anywhere else, and that brings us full circle, doesn’t it?<br />
<br />
I wanted to like Plastic Memories. Really, I did. It didn’t have to be some complex, philosophical inquiry into the definition of humanity and how it differs from artificial intelligence (which is the kind of show that many expected it to be); I would have been totally content with it just being a drama if they actually gave me a reason to care about its characters. If they didn’t ruin every moment they ever created with inopportune comedy. If they didn’t make the plot so damn predictable. If their plot devices weren’t so incredibly contrived. There were simply too many major problems to overlook, and that forces me to make the sad conclusion that Plastic Memories is a massive missed opportunity for what could have been a really enjoyable original anime. It lacked direction and coherent writing on all fronts, and I cannot recommend it to anybody.

    The story written by the author who made Steins;Gate, but if you were expecting a well written story look elsewhere. Conversely, if you’re a fan of forced melodrama and rapid tone changing, or enjoy unoriginal characters and are interested in seeing another Kanade clone feel free to waste your time on this.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
‘Plastic Memories’ takes place in the future where technology has advanced to the point where androids labeled as ‘Giftias’ exist and are capable of implementing human thought, emotion and memories. These exist for the purpose of human interaction and wish fulfillment, targeting those in need of company of some sort. After around 9 years,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192119">
        Giftias can no longer function and they must be shut down, terminating their memories. The story mainly revolves around 18 year old Tsukasa Mizugaki, a human, who along with a Giftia named Isla, joins the SAI Corporation and is placed in the division in charge of retrieving the Giftias. <br />
<br />
Giftia’s that fail to be retrieved will eventually expire and turn into a wild savage machine which they label as “Wanderer”. If technology has advanced so far that they can create artificial humans, there would be no reason why there should a 9 year limit, nor why they haven’t made any attempt to increase it like an extra memory card or something? The show never bothers to go into and explain that. It’s only clear that 9 years’ time the androids that they hand out will go hostile and attack anything in site. Good writing. They should implement cloud storage to expand the memory space, as increasing the limit would yield a huge profit margin for companies with proper marketing strategies. Even just transferring memories from one robot to another should be possible, they are machines after all. We have this technology now, it’s unthinkable to imagine that we couldn’t utilize it in the future. There is no reason to suspend this belief for this ridiculous premise. I can’t even fathom why they would distribute androids that could possibly attack people in the first place. And despite all of these complications, the show just chooses to just stick to the romantic comedy aspects the entire time which makes the sci-fi elements meaningless.<br />
<br />
The series focuses on the relationship between Tsukasa and Isla, so at first glance it seems like it will delve into the ethics of Giftia and human interaction. However, terrible execution renders this attempt at a moral irrelevant, as any point they were trying to make was invalidated by the constant tone shifts and forced drama that was impossible to empathize with. <br />
<br />
When I first had started Plastic Memories, the first episode presented all of these themes and ideas about cherishing memories; but it had a flaw that most dramas suffer from, poorly timed humor where it doesn’t belong. There was a sad moment when they had to retrieve a loli Giftia from her grandmother; it was supposed to be a sad moment but I couldn’t take it seriously because the sad tone was abruptly shifted to an out of place comedy routine. The drama is laughable and becomes out of place when scenes before and afterwards are inserted with poorly timed comedy. In fact the tone shifts are a common recurrence that continues for the rest of the show.<br />
In episode 3, Tsukasa moves in with his work partner Isla and wants to grow closer to her, attempting various methods to get Isla to open up, which leaves us with a wasted episode of rinse and repeat cliché slapstick humor. A majority of the episodes consisted of these dumb comedy skits; whenever something serious is happening, the very next scene presents a gag that kills the tension. All that is achieved in this case is a lot wasted episodes. Instead of spending time building and developing an atmosphere for empathy to establish a justifiable drama, we instead get a 60/40 split of slapstick comedy and forced drama. The theme of cherishing memories that the show tries to present is lost in translation due to rubbish execution. <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
The characters were bland and dull archetypes, including the beta protagonist who exists for the purpose of self-insertion and whose only notable traits include being “nice” and a pushover. the  typical Kanade rip-off who undergoes the standard kuudere “development”, the textbook tsundere, the drunkard, the dumb blonde bombshell, the nonchalant ladies’ man, and the prepubescent boy who you’ve never sexualized, not even once. This is a cast of unoriginal characters with no depth and minimal development that we will instantly forget about. Since the characters are archetypes it makes it difficult to provide empathy towards them. <br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
Art and animation did a fairly good job. The original character designs were done by okiura, the one responsible for the art and character designs for IS: Infinite Stratos. Although the designs themselves aren’t anything too special, looking at Michiru reminds me a lot of Asuka from the Evangelion series. The animation itself did a good job, it was consistent and it never had a massive dip in quality.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
For the sound it was fitting, the OST itself had a couple tracks I found to be lovely. The opening and ending theme are pretty good, they’re fitting for the show. They’re catchy and memorable, nothing amazing but I did like them.  <br />
<br />
OVERALL<br />
Plastic Memories was something I honestly thought had potential. I really wanted to like it. I was even pretty satisfied with the first episode despite the flaws it had toward the end. Overtime though I just couldn’t ignore the fact that these flaws kept reoccurring throughout the show. At least the ending wasn’t bullshit, but it was exactly what was expected making it predictable from episode one. I would be lying if I said I never enjoyed myself, but I found myself to be bothered more and more if anything. It had good ideas but it didn’t mean anything and the premise was ruined because the execution was abysmal. The show’s theme exploration was weak and the humor killed any of the attempted drama. If you want to watch something that is similar but is actually good then just check out Eve no Jikan instead.<br />

    If the memories you made while living faded after death, would you rather have not lived at all? Or would you cherish those memories to the very end? <br />
Plastic Memories is a show that, while looking mediocre and somewhat generic on the surface, is willing to tackle some pretty heavy themes.<br />
<br />
WARNING: This review will contain minor spoilers. Please keep in mind that it is difficult to write a wholesome review without revealing some of what happens. <br />
<br />
Story- 9<br />
The story can be considered as something that you&#039;re going to end up seeing a lot. Set in the future, Plastic Memories follows the protagonist, Tsukasa Mizugaki, who,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195609">
        due to circumstances, was not given the chance to enter college. As a result, he ends up getting a job retrieving Giftia. Giftia being a special type of Android loaded with a synthetic soul that display almost all the traits a living human does. You&#039;ve almost definitely heard something resembling this plot before, although this show does it better, due to one plot point. The Giftia have an extremely limited lifespan of roughly 9 years and 4 months. And after that lifespan reaches 0 hours, the Giftia loses all personality and memories.<br />
Here is where the the protagonist and his job step in. The job of Terminal Service, where Tsukasa is employed, is to retrieve those Giftia before their expiration date, as well as terminating the program and memories planted into that Giftia. This is where those heavy themes come into play. &quot;Our job... Is tearing memories apart.&quot;<br />
<br />
Art- 10<br />
The way you judge the art all comes down to opinion. Plastic Memories has a definite style to the art as well as the general feel of the show. The way they went about animating captures the sci-fi aspect almost perfectly. Character movements are smooth and fluid, and the backgrounds are absolutely amazing. At some points, when characters are talking, the shading/background color will change to some other, vibrant color.<br />
While it comes down to opinion, the art of this show is one of my favorites, and most likely will be for a long while.<br />
<br />
Characters- 9<br />
While only listed as a sci-fi show, Plastic Memories is also a slice of life, with a good dose of romance as well. Tsukasa is paired up with Isla, a Giftia nearing the end of her life span.<br />
While Tsukasa has his own problems, and Isla attempts to come to terms with her gradual loss of functionality, they go about their job, retrieving Giftia- after understanding the feelings of the owner.<br />
<br />
 This is where the show really shines. The side characters, or the owners of the Giftia marked for retrieval. Giftia display almost, if not all, the emotions a human does. Love, fear, hate, regret. After living with an Android like that for nine years, how attached would you be? Would you love that Android? Would you hate to let it go? Would you hate it for imitating a human? Would you regret making memories with it, only to have them torn apart?<br />
These are the heavy themes I was talking about. Almost all of the side characters are wonderfully developed, whether they are someone who refuses to let their Giftia be retrieved, or someone who hates their Giftia, calling her a liar.<br />
<br />
And let&#039;s not forget the romance aspect of the show.<br />
Tsukasa, as the official partner of Isla, the Giftia, is also her recognized owner.<br />
Very quickly these two come to fall in love with each other. But in comes another one of these heavy themes.<br />
If you had a month left to live, would you accept the feeling of the person you loved glad to make as many memories as possible?<br />
Or would you not want to hurt them in only a month&#039;s time?<br />
Like I said, this is a slice of life show. While being a cute and fluffy romance, extremely heavy themes are present.<br />
<br />
Sound- 8<br />
The soundtrack is able to capture the happy yet sad atmosphere of the show.<br />
I really can&#039;t say much about the OP and ED, except that they fit the tone of the show. (Except I love the way they animated the ending.)<br />
One thing I noticed only after rewatching the show, is that the end of the opening, Isla seems to change her reaction as the show and the relationship between her and Tsukasa progresses. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment- 10<br />
I love this show. It&#039;s also the only anime that almost made me cry. And I&#039;ve watched Angel Beats, Clannad, and other shows that people claim made them bawl.<br />
The ending is just so damn sad.<br />
<br />
Overall- 9<br />
Keep in mind this review is completely opinion-based, and if you disagree with me scoring it a 9, that&#039;s completely fine with me. Maybe I&#039;m looking at the show too deeply, or I&#039;m just a sucker for romances that develop like this, but I can honestly say that this is probably one of my favorite anime of all time. That might seem like a bold opinion, but hey, that&#039;s what it is. An opinion.<br />
Anyways, I&#039;d recommend this show to anyone who&#039;s looking for a decent romance, as this is one of the better ones that I personally have seen recently, and I&#039;d recommend it to just about anyone who&#039;s looking for a good show.<br />
Have a good day, MAL~

    Watching Plastic Memories is like taking a science class. I don’t why but my professor used to assign these experiments for us to do and when we finish, he always asked what we learned. Plastic Memories has this experimental feel when it takes its story in a sci-fi direction with a utopia-like setting. In a place (I assume a fictional alternate Japan) where robotics has made advancements to a point where we humans rely on them, there’s all sorts of possibilities. <br />
<br />
Directed by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara with Naotaka Hayashi writing the script, Plastic Memories is an original anime not based off any material. There’s a plus

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191484">
        for this as it will leave the audience to expect the unexpected. Also, it’s studio Dogakobo’s first original work. Recently they have been involved in some slice of life anime series that may or may not left an impression. Nonetheless, Plastic Memories combines element of sci-fi, drama, and slice of life to craft this futuristic story – one where humans and robots co-exist as a sort of experiment.<br />
<br />
A lot needs to be learned from the very few episodes. In fact, I think the first episode is one of the most important one of the series as it establishes many mechanics that carries their purpose throughout the whole duration. First, we have Giftia, a term to describe biological androids with capability to interact, understand, and function with humans. They even have emotional appeals to as seen constantly throughout the show. What makes this setup interesting is that they have a mind of their own rather than being just a mere program. Another interesting and more important element is that Gifitias have limited lifespans. According to the series, they can live up to approximately 81920 (9 years and 3 months). So when thinking about this, it can be made for a fact that the show spells out relationships that are doomed to end. What I find interesting about this addition is that the experiences the show tries to deliver will make more impact. And in a way, that’s something to think about.<br />
<br />
Anyone who has seen Chobits or a show about human-robot relationships may be familiar with this premise. The main male protagonist Tsukasa Mizugaki becomes involved with SAI Corporation, a place where Gifitias are designed and made. His job is to actually retrieve Gifitias that are near the end of their lifespan. I guess what happens next could be fate or something but he is partnered with Isla, a Gifitia who is supposed to be “experienced” in doing the task. Little did we know…<br />
 <br />
In essence, Plastic Memories offers a little bit of everything except for giant robot wars or an android rebellion. No, what I find this series attractive in a few ways is how it handles each episode to add a little bit more and more to what it started off. Every episode shows development for our characters. In particular, Tsukasa and Isla’s relationship is a core element that seems to push forward the story. From the beginning, they are not particular close. Tsukasa is a newbie so he lacks experience while Isla herself also doesn’t seem to be skillful at retrieving Gifitias. So what do we have now? An unbalanced pair? Somewhat like that but there’s also an odd connection between the two. The pair has one human and one android capable of interacting in human-like behaviors. They are not programmed to act like zombies but instead actually has genuine emotions. In general, we see this throughout the story from a variety of perspectives. Especially in some of the later episodes, there are cases where Gifitias and their partners refuses to surrender themselves despite knowing that an everlasting relationship is non-existent. So when it comes to Tsukasa and Isla, it’s also obvious that one day, their relationship will cease to exist. That brings back to what I mentioned before as the show tests their relationship each episode. It’s kind of like an experiment where both characters learns about each other and perhaps even themselves. <br />
<br />
While Tsukasa and Isla are the main focus of the show, there’s also other characters that play meaningful roles. Michiru, another employee and superior of Isla, brings into the show a harsher reality of their jobs. In essence, her past shows that violence and requisition also becomes part of their society when Gifitas are forcefully terminated when due time comes. In one of the mid-season episodes, it breaks down the barriers of lightheartedness and shows a darker side of their society. Then, there are other characters such as Zack, Kazuki, Yasutaka, among others. While their roles aren’t as significant as the main leads, they do also bring in a mixture of drama and comedy into the series. <br />
<br />
Speaking of comedy, I have to say that Plastic Memories is a hit or miss. From the beginning, it can be pleasing especially with some of the jokes and dialogues between the main characters. Then, it gets repetitive. I mean repetitive as in the same type of recycled themes that you may find in harem-esque shows. While this series isn’t a harem, there are times when it resorts to similar antics. Also, timing is a key and only on occasions do I find some of the comedy appropriate as the series progresses. In short, a middling entertainment is how I can describe the comedy. On the other hand, there’s appreciation and effort given to the drama elements. Hints of romance are also evident while we see how much Tsukasa and Isla’s relationship develops. And while this isn’t a rom-com shoujo, there are moments that feels like so that’s nicely paced and well-acted. Otherwise, this isn’t at a level that will get so complex where you’ll spill your popcorn. The story itself also has a rather strange pacing at times. Sometimes, the standalone episodes feels little more than a waste of time while other others has a distinctive way of story building. Neither are a major impact to the overall series in general though.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the artwork feels smooth. It works because of its charming visual feat and texture the studio puts into the character designs. The watercolor-like atmosphere also paints and communicates its point across; to get let the audience feel the portrayal of its setting. In fact, the setting of the series itself has credible artwork with its futuristic architecture, machinery, and of course the Gafitia. While there’s nothing special to say about Tsukasa, his partner Isla does have a few peculiar characteristics. Her expressions of a hybrid stoic/emotional/cluelessness can get the audience to be quite curious of her. Other characters also shows a good amount of texture with their design. It’s interesting to see how the Gafitia resemble so much like humans in physical design despite knowing that they have limited lifespans, far less than our own.<br />
<br />
Music has a stronger appeal to a show like this. It’s important to match the atmosphere to create a sensation and I think the show nailed it with its OST. Yokoyama Masaru (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Joshiraku) composes of the music which delivers its purpose – creating a feel of sensation. I also have to give some credit to the voice actors and actresses for portraying the characters. It’s not always easy to play the role of a non-human character but Isla in particular has a voice that feels welcoming to this show. Similarly, the OP and ED theme songs are coordinated with a smooth delicacy and bits of charm.<br />
<br />
In retrospect, Plastic Memories has a feeling of sensitivity behind it. It told a human story about a biological android and how Isla adapted and learned from a human. There are times when it can make you genuinely feel moved by its storytelling while other times are easily forgettable. I think most of that applies to the recurring jokes for the latter as this series’ comedy really feels lackluster. The romance itself, while innocent and charming, suffers from pacing. You’ll also have to keep an eye on the lookout for a lot of the mechanics that makes this series possible. However, this show does represent a cutting edge of sci-fi fiction with a good dose of slice of life. Life is just seriously full of surprises at times.

    Have you ever seen an anime with a premise so uninspired and lacking in imagination that you know it&#039;s doomed for failure before it even gets a chance to show off? However, because you&#039;re an anime fan who finds it pointless to just watch stuff you like, you continue on out of sheer curiosity regarding how badly it&#039;ll be handled, only to realize you underestimated the depths a man can take to stretch said weak premise out in order to fit a full-series length? That&#039;s pretty much how I watch practically 90% of the anime I keep up with on a regular basis, and Plastic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191718">
        Memories happens to be one of said percentage.<br />
<br />
Yes, trying to demand ambition from Dogakobo is like begging a grizzly bear to save you from hitmen despite the fact that he&#039;s a fucking corpse because you thought poisoning his berry patch would have been a funny to make on Facebook (you monster), so I wasn&#039;t too surprised that the show turned out as inane as it did. But whilst I&#039;ve yet to meet a colleague who disagreed with me, the semi-good reaction this show has been getting from the overall community is more baffling than an Australian politician&#039;s general incompetence at being human. I know a lot of anime fans love “feels” and all, which makes these sort of shows both easy and difficult to criticize. Because whilst it’s easy to say what doesn’t work about ‘em, said method of storytelling is ultimately a style, the same way all music and humor is a style at the end of the day. It either works for you or it doesn’t, making any criticism you dish out being rendered ultimately pointless by the fact that your brain and childhood just isn’t hardwired to get it.<br />
<br />
The thing is though, even by those incredibly irrational standards, Plastic Memories is pretty damn awful right down to the very concept. In some distant future exists humanoid androids called “Gifita” who only have a fixed lifespan of ten years, because any longer than that and they become more rabid than a pack of raccoons after being sprayed by a skunk. Just before said lifespan expires, they are retrieved by a group of &quot;Retrievers&quot; in order to be put to sleep, basically making them futuristic dogs except with the ability to talk and act out your pedophilic tendencies towards if you so choose. Except the show isn&#039;t really even about how dog retrieval life is like. It&#039;s about the actual partings and what they mean to people, with most of said story being told through an office worker and his &quot;actually dog&quot; partner. Reminds me of that awful era when Dogakobo was releasing visual novel adaptations that had decent premises on paper and proceeded to ignore ‘em completely in favor of either two things: shallow melodramatic shit and shallow melodramatic shit with poorly animated fight scenes.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, the office workers in this anime look pretty damn young, don&#039;t they? I&#039;m not expecting a huge growth spurt or anything after you leave high school, but the younger characters all look and act like the kouhai of the middle schoolers in Evangelion whilst the older ones are pretty much the grown-up Evangelion characters with some of the blandest designs you&#039;ll ever see. It would have been an improvement to just have them all wear black face.<br />
<br />
The anime is written by Naotaka Hayashi, whose previous works were about taking high-concept sci-fi and proceeding to just throw it in the background whilst focusing on characterization that&#039;s basically just putting a bunch of nerd tropes together and giving them one gimmick that&#039;s not even all that important to the story half the time. But if those semicolon adaptations are the equivalent of a romance film starring Ryan O&#039;Neal, Plastic Memories is the direct-to-video sequel that was never made because it was too stupid for the world to see. And it’s not just because I find the show overly manipulative. In fact, I think detractors in general overuse that criticism, never taking into consideration why and how something can even be considered overly manipulative in the first place. You can’t just say “I hate manipulation” because as I myself keep saying, ALL drama is manipulative. Even Mufasa’s death in The Lion King is manipulative, and it’s still considered by many to be one of the best achievements in western animation to this day. <br />
<br />
But whilst it wasn’t the only reason why said scene was powerful for most people, at the end of the day, you can’t deny that The Lion King in general is a big film with grand ambitions beyond an annoying Jonathan Taylor-Thomas character crying over his dead daddy. Plastic Memories, on the other hand, is literally all about some bland guy we don’t even learn anything about getting sad about the fact that his dog is dying. Except in order to increase the manipulation, said dog is actually a small moe girl. I don’t claim to be an expert of the genre, but practically every single story about a dog from Old Yeller to that Silverfang anime from the 80s has always been sad, because they always involve parting with ‘em and...well...is there any way to spin a happy tale out of that? What matters is how you use said tragedy from representing growth to...erm...representing growth, and Plastic Memories doesn’t even do that.<br />
<br />
By the end of this incredibly padded story - because someone thought that repeating the same toothless joke up to three times an episode at minimum and a random incident involving some black market dealers that’s never brought up again counts as a legitimate way to achieve a one-cour length from this - you know nothing new about anything. Only the main couple is important in the grand scheme of things, and they never grow up from where they started - something they were in dire need of because they have less maturity than a middle school kid who believes that Santa Claus is real and looks like Elmo from Sesame Street. There’s an ambiguous closing scene involving a Giftia whose face isn’t shown after a short time-skip following the final climax. And no matter how you spin it, said scene doesn’t make any sense whatsoever. <br />
<br />
If the Giftia’s body is whose I think it is, that would ruin whatever character journey you can wring out of the main. And if it’s not, then what exactly is the dude going to apply in regards to this new being? The show refuses to accomplish more than the very basics of what you can achieve with visual novel-style writing and tragedy stories in general to the point that I’m practically convinced at this point that Naotaka Hayashi is less of a real person and more of an auto-generating machine when someone wants to release a VN-style anime. Bland nice guy schmuck? Check. Little moe love interest who can’t take care of herself? Check. Tsundere who not-so-secretly helps the couple whilst desiring “bland nice guy” cock? Check. Potentially interesting world buried under banal personal problems? Check. Reminding us that Evangelion exists? Every anime does that these days, but check anyways.<br />
<br />
As a result, no one from the creators to the actual characters this show is supposed to be centered on seem to be into anything, and that’s pretty much why Plastic Memories fails. Even if you ignore the cardboard stereotypes, the cloying melodrama, the flat visuals, and forgettable music, this show just doesn’t accomplish anything it sets out to do at all. The decision to set the anime in a futuristic worlds adds nothing to the story, the working environment adds nothing to the characters, and whatever moral I’m supposed to get out of the story is buried under a lot of crappy cliches. Even Dreamworks’ movies have made their agendas clear underneath their crappy pop-culture referencing and animation hiccups. And when you have less going for you than Bee Movie and Shrek 3...well then I’ve got no more words to waste on you. You sad, pity party-seeking loser.

    Ok, this is my very first review so do not expect too much of it.<br />
Plastic Memories is a Drama, Comedy, Romance and Sci-fi style of anime.<br />
Basically, there are robots named &quot;giftias&quot; that helps people domestically, or for others reasons. They have an operating period and as soon as this deadline ends, they start loosing its memory and end up becoming threats to people, so they have to be collected, but this time is about of nine years, more than enough time to develop a good relationship with your giftia, and that&#039;s the main purpose of the anime.<br />
<br />
On the issue of drama, it can be a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192642">
        very dramatic anime, when you anxiously want to know what will happen in the next episode. The comedy is good, but is not the strongest point in the anime, it was a good point to create an affection with the characters, but as I said, it&#039;s not the strongest point of the anime. About the romance, there&#039;s that one typical problem faced by the protagonists in almost every romance anime, where they are concerned about frivolous things and end up taking many time to develop a relationship because of theirs shyness and other trivial reasons.<br />
<br />
Here are my grades:<br />
Story (9/10): For me the story is very good and with a good focus, it wanted to demonstrate that even having little time to create good memories to someone, it&#039;s better than have not created any. In the beggining, this anime presented all the plot and in my opinion the story became a little predictable, I mean, it became easy to know what would happen throughout the course of the anime, not as much as turning que anime less enjoyable, but that is a small negative point.<br />
<br />
Art (10/10): The art of anime is very beautiful as well as most anime coming out, nothing important to say here.<br />
<br />
Sound (10/10): As far as openings, sound effects and OST&#039;s are very well made and give pleasure to my ears, on openings and endings, I think it is something extremely important for an anime, and they pleased me a lot.<br />
<br />
Character (9/10): There are several characters that have very different personalities, are typical characters of anime, but hefty well, everyone has their defects and their abilities.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(9/10): I have to admit that sometimes I felt very anxious to see the next episode, but there were also times when I had almost no desire to watch it, but the anime itself is very pleasurable to watch and so this grade is nine.<br />
<br />
Overall: (10/10): I think the anime is really a masterpiece, the end is great and full of feelings, many people criticize the end saying it was very predictable and obvious, but in my opinion was a realistic end and so unexpected.<br />
<br />
-POSSIBLE DANGER OF SPOILER-<br />
The end of the anime is very criticized, because they say it was obvious and predictable, but the truth is that what was expected was to be a final in which everything would be fine and they would be happy in the end by some miracle, what would be technically impossible, so I do not think that was obvious and much less predictable, was a great, realistic and perfect end, Isla was happy and so was Tsukasa, they made what they wanted to do and Isla could rest in peace.

    So now that Spring season basically ended, it&#039;s time to review anime. Plastic Memories is an anime by Aniplex about this Corporation that is known for taking back these robots with human emotions called &quot;Giftia&quot; once it is time to take them back.<br />
<br />
Before we get right into Plastic Memories, I would like point out something about Aniplex. <br />
Aniplex is known for working on Angels Beats and Anohana. Just by me mentioning those two, you pretty much know what to expect from Plastic Memories.<br />
 I thought Angel Beats was alright, but it&#039;s praised for having such a sad ending and many tragic moments. I found the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192572">
        show to lack character development and the pacing was awfully rushed. It would&#039;ve been a great show if it took its time to present the story in a better way and if the show was 24 episodes. Worst of all, I didn&#039;t find it to be really all that sad.<br />
I can&#039;t say much about Anohana; I watched 3 episodes and it&#039;s now on-hold, but for what I&#039;ve heard, it has <br />
&quot;The saddest animu ending evaaa!!&quot;<br />
For what I watched in those 3 episodes, it felt like nothing was really happening and it was all just a build up to a sad ending. <br />
And now we have Plastic Memories, which is being called the &quot;saddest animu of this year!!&quot; <br />
Where do I stand with this<br />
judgement? Well...<br />
<br />
Plastic Memories wasn&#039;t good, it was pretty bland. The first episode was actually pretty good, I was very interested in the story and the concept it presented. Though, the characters looked extremely generic and boring, they weren&#039;t too bad in the first episode. But then the show took this really weird direction, for some reason. <br />
<br />
Plastic Memories has only one tag and that tag is &quot;Sci-fi.&quot; I can understand if this was the tag for the first episode and maybe the second, but everything after it isn&#039;t a sci-fi at all. It&#039;s a complete RomCom that has some sci-fi elements from time to time, but nothing to call the whole show just a &quot;sci-fi&quot; anime. <br />
The story is actually pretty interesting and something I wanted to see play out well, but it was never focused on it. It all just feels like the show had a great direction, but then an idiot changed the script. Episode 3 is the start of this series starting to build this RomCom and drifting away from the plot we were supposed to be focusing on. Lots of stuff are introduced throughout the series when it tries to go back to the actual plot, but they barely explain it and it ends up leaving a few plot holes. I think Plastic Memories should&#039;ve balanced the plot with the romance instead of just ignoring the plot entirely, just to focus on the very generic and boring romance. <br />
<br />
The characters were all dull and none of them felt like real people. If the show is not gonna focus on the plot much, then they need great characters to keep the show going. Unfortunately, this was a complete waste. The dialog in the show was very standard and made the humans feels like robots more than the actual robots. The characters are utterly bland and are flatter than a 4 year-old&#039;s ass. <br />
<br />
Isla is one of the Giftia&#039;s that is working with our male main character, Tsukasa. Isla is simply a loli and there isn&#039;t much to say about her. She&#039;s the typical shy girl that slowly opens up to the main character. She&#039;s not well developed and she&#039;s not interesting at all.<br />
<br />
Tsukasa is super generic, bland and just very uninteresting. He&#039;s the nice main character that is very shy. You never really care for him and I never found myself liking his character at all. I didn&#039;t hate him, I was just not invested in his character. <br />
<br />
The other characters simply feel like plot devices to get our main characters together before the ending. Also, most of them are characters you would expect in a generic RomCom, like the typical Tsundere. The whole show is just one build up to the ending, that you can predict after watching 2 or 3 episodes. Everything that happens can be predicted easily, not only because it&#039;s very easy to spot and they make it extremely noticeable, but also, because it has been done to death already. It&#039;s not unique in any way and has nothing new going for it. Now, I&#039;m not saying that you have to be completely original and not do something that has been done before, but at least give it a new spin instead of making me watch the same show I&#039;ve watched before. I mention this because some people would bring up that making something original these days is very hard, and I completely agree, but making the exact same show with very little change to it is kinda lazy. I mean, Plastic Memories tried to do something new with the plot, but it never focused on it well after the first 2 episodes.<br />
<br />
The animation was pretty standard Romantic Comedy kind of animation. Nothing really stands out and it never impressed me, it was just pretty average. The soundtrack is not really worth mentioning. It&#039;s alright, the OP is good and the ED is good, but the score is pretty average. The character designs were completely generic. The thing that bothered me so much about them, is that the mains looked exactly like the mains in Absolute Duo, which I just wanna forget about by now. <br />
<br />
The comedic episode in Plastic Memories never felt like they belonged in the show. Especially just little moments in the show where they just make a very out of placed joke, that wasn&#039;t really funny at all. Like, yeah, that is completely subjective, you might find it hilarious, but you&#039;re supposed to know when to place the comedy. You&#039;re not supposed to place comedy seconds after a very serious and dramatic scene. It&#039;s very unbalanced and it ruins every sense of emotion behind it. It&#039;s like a bipolar person wrote the script at times, and said, &quot;Well, fuck this guy, let&#039;s kill off everyone and now, for a very well placed joke to make everyone feel better.&quot;<br />
It just ends up reminding me of the comedy in Your Lie in April. Only that in Your Lie in April, the comedy is sometimes delivered in a good moment, but Plastic Memories has no idea when it&#039;s time for a good moment.<br />
<br />
Overall, Plastic Memories is a huge disappointment for people that liked the first episode like I did. The whole thing is a build up to the ending, which actually wasn&#039;t bad, but the journey to get to that ending kinda was. I would be lying if I said I wasn&#039;t entertained while watching it, but it&#039;s mostly because I had nothing else to do. Now, I&#039;m aware that some people will enjoy this show, and that&#039;s not a bad thing. I&#039;m only saying how I feel about this anime, and if you&#039;re a person that would be bothered by the things I mentioned in my review, then I would suggest you skip this one. I&#039;m pretty sure that most of us can agree that this had potential to be better, and I&#039;m gonna give Plastic Memories a 4/10.<br />
<br />
🚨🚨🚨Spoiler Section🚨🚨🚨<br />
This is gonna be a quick spoiler section for the ending. If you don&#039;t want the ending spoiled, then please skip this, if you already watched the show or you don&#039;t plan on watching it, then keep reading.<br />
<br />
Why the fuck didn&#039;t Tsukasa do anything about Isla at the end of the show? If you don&#039;t know, Isla basically dies or they simply take her back. But I mean, Tsukasa didn&#039;t try to somehow save her? She&#039;s not dead, she&#039;s just sleeping forever. There was so much potential to be had with this anime, but the writers didn&#039;t care. After the credits of the last episode, we see Tsukasa coming back months after to work with this new person. Exactly when that happened, it reminded me of the ending for Angel Beats. <br />
Really, Aniplex? No fucking creativity at all? <br />
&quot;Oh, it&#039;s supposed to be sad, because she dies.&quot;<br />
The only thing that died was the potential for an anime that could&#039;ve been alright. <br />

    [Spoiler Warning]<br />
<br />
Plastic Memories is a show that very few people will be able to fully understand, emphasize with, and appreciate. It is a story about love, family, memories, loss, but most of all, it is a story about smiling through pain and understanding yourself.<br />
<br />
The story is nothing amazing, as this is very much a character focused sci-fi love story with some light comedy touches. Many have complained about how the comedy takes away from the tone of the series, and while I can see that, you do have to appreciate how through the comedy, you see more about the characters than ever before. For example,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280252">
        in episode three, Tsukasa Mizugaki and Isla start living together. Isla won&#039;t talk to Tsukasa, so Tsukasa does everything in his power to make Isla talk to him. While this is very much a comedic episode, it highlights two things: 1: How Isla is so disconnected from everything in her life and the world, and 2: Tsukasa&#039;s love for Isla. This is something people often forget about when criticizing this show. Another brilliant thing this comedy does for you on rewatches is to highlight the sadness of the show after you learn more about Isla.<br />
<br />
The art and music of this show are also fantastic. The art design looks absolutely beautiful, with gorgeous lighting and environments, and the music often shakes you to the core. <br />
<br />
And then there&#039;s the ending scene. This is the most I&#039;ve ever cried watching a form of medium... ever. Nothing even comes close. You can see the shows I&#039;ve seen on my list.<br />
<br />
I mentioned before how very few people will, essentially, understand this anime. And this is it: It&#039;s because you can&#039;t really empathize with the characters of this show unless you are a specific type of person. I can&#039;t really go into more detail unless you&#039;ve seen the show to the end. Just know this: this show is among the best I&#039;ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
Overall, this show made me cry, smile, laugh, glare, and through it all, I was feeling such a storm of emotion and connection very few anime (or mediums) strive to create. I can&#039;t recommend this show enough.<br />
<br />
Edit: Okay, so I know saying some pretty pretentious stuff here, but going any more in-depth here will spoil the series. Just trust me on that.

    Okay, so is the genre ever going to be updated or what?<br />
<br />
I&#039;m going to tell you what you&#039;re getting here, since MAL just decided to leave the genre as sci-fi and call it a day.<br />
Actual Genres (From most common to least): Romance, Drama, Comedy, Sci-fi<br />
You&#039;re welcome.<br />
This show is a romantic dramedy with a sci-fi coat of paint, and it&#039;s a damn good one at that.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
The story is nothing entirely new, it takes a lot from other sources, but what it does that is new is pretty interesting. The concept of androids with a limited lifespan is interesting, and the way that they leave the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191737">
        ending up to interpretation were definitely some of the best parts, but to keep from spoilers I&#039;m leaving this part here.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
The art is gorgeous in this anime, the scenery itself is so nice to look at, and the character design is great. The facial expressions are definitely the high point, as they look extremely human without being uncanny.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
The OST is a great addition to an already good show, even though there is a very small selection of music, they do so much with it that it&#039;s astounding. The voice actors all do extremely well at their roles. I can&#039;t say too much here as I&#039;m not one to pay much attention to sound, but I can say that is was amazing for what I did hear.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
Every character in Plastic Memories is great in some way or another, the characters that need development get development, and the others that don&#039;t are there as a foil for our main characters. My personal favorite character is Zack, who&#039;s both extremely adult and childish at the same time. Every character has something, and you&#039;ll more than likely find a favorite.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
It&#039;s a fun show to watch, it knows how to do everything it wants to do, and is generally an amazing anime. A common comparison that is brought up is Shigatsu, which is another great anime, but Plastic Memories does everything that Shigatsu did, but better. Shigatsu was melodramatic, but Plastic Memories was just dramatic. Shigatsu had horribly timed comedy, but Plastic Memories uses comedy to show the ups and downs of everything in the universe of the anime.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
You know, it&#039;s kind of funny, for an anime about androids, Plastic Memories is the most human anime I&#039;ve seen in a while, it shows the ups and downs of a relationship, and really delves into some really deep things. If you know what you&#039;re getting into, you&#039;re gonna really enjoy Plastic Memories.

    &quot;There&#039;s one thing about this job you need to remember: doing this job never feels rewarding.&quot; -Isla<br />

Well thanks for that, Isla. Sometimes that&#039;s the reviewer&#039;s life too.<br />

So, we&#039;ve got some super veterans like the awesome Megumi Toyoguchi (Revy, Black Lagoon, Winry, FMA/B) as the underutilized, but funny psycho boss, Kazuki. Sora Amamiya (Touka, Tokyo Ghoul) also heads up as Isla, and does a good job playing the airhead, naive character. There&#039;s also Mr. &quot;Screw The Rules&quot; Seto Kaiba himself, Kenjirou Tsuda. The OST is a bit underwhelming, and during some key moments is actually silent. Very forgettable.

Pretty plain, run of the mill animation. Nothing flashy, nothing outstanding, just does what it does. You&#039;ve got the different characters you can tell apart by their hair color, and pretty much everyone else fades to the background in shades of brown and gray. Chibi faces, blue with shock, and all kinds of blushing are here, and teasing the girl with big boobs, if that kind of stuff appeals to you.<br />

<br />
I&#039;m going to be frank- Plastic Memories is a case of false advertising. Oh but the fanboys will cry foul with how &quot;feelsy&quot; and &quot;sad&quot; it is. Yeah, it&#039;s &quot;feelsy&quot; and heartfelt if you&#039;re a complete sap sucker. Anime fans seem to be drawn to this nebulous and utterly trite idea of &quot;feels&quot; over and over in these pathetically thin &quot;tragic love stories&quot;, and for no good reason. It&#039;s turning into a genre of its own, this recycled tugging-at-heartstrings narrative- so much to the point where we&#039;re literally watching the same kid and his dog die every week, with a slightly different coat of paint. If I want to watch that crap, I&#039;ll go to the Hallmark channel, dang. This show is grasping at straws for a romance narrative after starting out onto the path of what seemed to be an interesting psychological show. <br />
<br />
You see, the Plastic Memories fans have conveniently forgotten how terribly paced and off topic the first several episodes are compared to what it transitions to later in the show. In the beginning, Plastic Memories was dropping lines like &quot;Ripping apart memories is our job&quot; and &quot;Having happy and beautiful memories won&#039;t always bring you salvation. The more beautiful a memory is, the more painful it can become&quot;. That&#039;s some dark and heavy shit. That&#039;s not romcom material. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, the plot was asking questions of itself like, &quot;what happens to these androids when they&#039;re retired?&quot; and &quot;why is it that science only allows for them to have this limited lifespan?&quot; which are never addressed. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s this taste of a psychological narrative about loss and the meaning of kinship and companionship that I thought this show was going to be about that interested me in it in the first place. If I were to infer what the story was about by the synopsis provided by MAL, I would not conclude that this was a story about loss and coping, along with maybe some action and a touch of comedy, mostly serious stuff. I never make note of the tags that shows are listed by, because they&#039;re irrelevant anyway, but Plastic Memories takes the irrelevance cake- it has one tag: Sci-Fi. Well Ho-lee crap, tell me something I don&#039;t know. <br />
<br />
Kind of like the title implies, Plastic Memories has an identity crisis going on. <br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
The Giftias (the androids central to the show) are imprinted with varying personalities. One of the ones retrieved (the universe term for being disposed of when their predetermined lifespan runes out) was a bodyguard for a Mafia man, another was a child for a parent, one a parent to an orphan, and all sorts of other familial relations. The effect of the loss of what&#039;s effectively a close family member is touched upon early, but dumped in favor of yet another teen romance show.<br />
<br />
While this could be a great setup for &quot;is it human love that we require, or a sense of companionship?&quot; or another existential theme about &quot;are the androids capable of their own thought?&quot; but no. They even touch on a deep political and sociological subject of &quot;since the Giftias are owned, can they even become people?&quot;<br />
<br />
No, Plastic Memories is too heavy handed in exposition for that. Rather than leaving it up to the audience to decide, they just lay it all out there. Despite the completely arbitrary &quot;Made For TV™&quot; drama of a 10 year life span, it&#039;s explained that Giftia owners have the option to re-use the body of the Giftia when it&#039;s retired, and they can even REPLANT THE SAME PERSONALITY inside of it! There are murmurings of &quot;Can the Giftias remember anything from their past incarnations?&quot; But this is quickly dropped in favor of &quot;OMG HOW SAD THE GIFTIAS ARE THIS POOR TIME BOMB OF FEELINGS WHAT DO YOU DOOOOO!?&quot; <br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
So, despite the fact that you&#039;re hit with what you know to be end of the show in the first two episodes, and the solution is also already given... the authors decide to change gears to this melodramatic sob fest filled with tsundere side chick, overbearing people trying to live Tsukasa&#039;s life for him, and a general clusterf*ck of slice of life and cheap romance. <br />
<br />
You can&#039;t even blame these plot holes on a crappy adaptation, because Plastic Memories is a WHOLLY ORIGINAL anime! The writers at Doga Kobo started off with a passable concept, and then passed the pen to somebody who just got done reading some garbage ass, written with an 8 year old&#039;s concept of love Twilight fanfic, and then tried desperately to plagiarize it while drunk! <br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
The characters, much like the story, fit the title perfectly. Plastic. Fake. Artificial. Phony. <br />
<br />
What&#039;s perhaps the most damning part of how fake this show is, is that we&#039;re shown through Isla&#039;s words and actions that she, as a Giftia, has NO EMPATHY. (For the vocabulary challenged among us, empathy is being able to UNDERSTAND emotions, not feel sorry for someone- which is sympathy.) {Have sympathy for people who suffered through this show, but empathize that you understand their anger and frustration.}<br />
That&#039;s right- Giftias can&#039;t understand human being&#039;s emotions. They MANUFACTURE their own &quot;&quot;&quot;Plastic Feelings&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;, emotions and moods and project that outwardly. Kazuki herself explains what the feeling of regret is to Isla in episode 10, on top of how many times we see &quot;love&quot; and &quot;sadness&quot; explained to the Giftias. <br />
<br />
So my question to the plot and writers is now, &quot;why the hell should anyone in the show {much less a viewer} even care about Giftias being taken away when their lives end?&quot; Sure, something that&#039;s been a staple in your life for 10 years being excised one day could hurt, but they&#039;re not humans. They&#039;re basically just glorified pets. Doga Kobo makes NO attempt at trying to make the Giftias more human, particularly because the other Giftias in the show are even more robotic than Isla is! Guess what? The best part is that they replace the Giftia&#039;s personality with a new one, for FREE! Who&#039;s to say that Isla&#039;s body isn&#039;t someone else&#039;s long gone child or girlfriend?? <br />
<br />
Make some new memories, Tsukasa, preferably with a real person this time. They have OKCupid in this world, right? (Also, wtf happened to nepotism in the future?)<br />
Tsukasa Mizugaki: <br />
Age: 19<br />
Sex: No<br />
Location: Terminal Service (lol not the hospital morgue, but I want to kill myself)<br />
Interests: crushing on robots, being a sappy, bumbling idiot, having no sense of social cues, and ignoring the advances of real women in favor of robots.<br />
Looking For: A clumsy girl who refuses to talk to me and/or a hot and cold spicy redhead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall and Recommendation: 3<br />
<br />
If you want a really generic SOL romcom that starts like crap and ends with THA FEELS (or inversely, an interesting premise of a psychological show that goes Hindenburg after about 4 episodes)... Knock yourself out. <br />
<br />
Drop me a line for whenever you feel that fanboy rage building up after reading this one- I look forward to it.<br />

    Memories are the thing that we all impact us in different ways.  Pleasant memories give us a feeling of warmth and comfort.  Traumatic memories give us sadness and despair.  And the memories of people that have long disappeared are the ones that cause us to have both kinds all at once.  So when you lose the ones you cherish so much, how exactly would you react?  Here, a review of Plastic Memories, an anime that deals with such a hard question with relative success.<br />
<br />
Story (7.33/10): Plastic Memories, or Plamemo in the shorthanded version of the name, features a technologically advanced

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191475">
        world.  In this world, the corporation known as SAI Corp. have developed an android called a Giftia, that is so much like a human, that the two are almost indiscernible from one another.  However, unlike humans, Giftias have one major flaw, they can only function for a maximum of 81,920 hours (roughly 9.3 years) until their programming starts to fail and they become corrupt and unable to function.  (Although, I&#039;m not really sure how specific we are here when it comes to indiscernible.  Not quite sure if an android is capable of certain bodily functions like waste disposal or reproduction, because apparently the only real difference they have from humans is their lifespan.)  As a result, a branch of the SAI Corp. called the Terminal Service goes and retrieves the Giftias that have their lives almost expired.  Here, we follow the story of our main protagonist Tsukasa, as he starts his job in the terminal service, where he meets a Giftia known as Isla.<br />
<br />
Quite simply, the entire runtime of the anime revolves around Tsukasa and the job of the Terminal Service, where our main protagonists Tsukasa and Isla go around the city and pick up Giftias that are almost expiring.  However, that isn&#039;t all that the story has to offer.  In addition to the retrieval stories where the show focuses on the lives and the memories that the characters witness as they retrieve the spent Giftias, it also puts a lot of time into Isla and her backstory since Isla is a veteran member of the Terminal service group.  The issue with this is that there&#039;s an imbalance between these two, with the majority of the story focusing on Isla rather than the retrievals that was shown at the beginning to midway of the story.  Personally, I would&#039;ve preferred the stories about other Giftias more so than seeing an episode about Isla since a good chunk of those episodes that focus on Isla don&#039;t really have much impact in the long run.  This is mostly due to the fact that the show spends essentially its second half on one character rather than side stories that could have had as good if not greater impact.  <br />
<br />
In addition, the show has a bit of a comedic issue with it.  A lot of the time, Plamemo has a lot of more serious moments, tackling the issue of memories of other people and the morality of ripping away these people apart from one another, only leaving the memories behind as its main point.  But it also has a lot of plot points that serve to be more comedic, some haha moments.  This creates an issue because a lot of the comedy feels misplaced and completely out of left field.  It doesn&#039;t really meld with the current situation as well as one might think, and it, in several instances, killed the mood that was going on.  <br />
<br />
Another problem I found was that the plot itself was actually rather predictable.  We have an object that has limited lifespan, and we have the main heroine who is that kind of object.  (I&#039;ll give you three guesses.)  As such, the impact that the series had really didn&#039;t show all that much.  There were moments which I felt in the series were really good and not that predictable, but those were the episodes and story points that focused on other Giftia, not Isla.  Also, the show kind of turned table as to what kind of show it was towards the end, turning into more of a rom-com, so that was also a slight issue.  <br />
<br />
In the end though, I really didn&#039;t have a sense of satisfaction with the way Plamemo ended.  It was a very anticlimactic ending and it just sort of...ends.  Personally, I would&#039;ve liked to have a little bit more drama or a little more something because everything just went far too smoothly, making me doubt that it was going to, only to see that it was actually going to end the way I thought it.  <br />
<br />
Overall, I felt that Plamemo had a very good direction that it was going in, but took a different route.  The comedy felt out of place at times, the show was fairly predictable, and it didn&#039;t really stick with one direction to go towards, rather, going towards two directions in which both felt somewhat unsatisfying in the end.  Regardless, with the areas of the plot that focused more on the side character stories, I felt like the show really excelled in that regard and brought the theme of memories and how they affect us forward in a great way.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Great character side stories<br />
+ Good expressiveness of themes<br />
-  Plot was predictable <br />
-  Show went two directions, resulting in unsatisfying storyline<br />
-  Comedy felt misplaced a lot and clashed with story<br />
<br />
Characters (7.10/10): Characters in Plamemo are separated into three categories, the main characters, the terminal service characters, and the retrieval characters, each with their own plus and minuses to be had.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with our main protagonist, Tsukasa.  Tsukasa as a new employee of the Terminal Service is shown in a fish out of water style, where he has zero clue as to what he&#039;s supposed to do and has to learn from the people already working there in order to properly do his job.  As the series goes along, Tsukasa starts to gain a bit of character development, connecting and understanding with the people that he takes Giftias away from, even going to the extent of apologizing for what he has to do out of sympathy.  While that&#039;s good and all, a lot of the time I feel like Tsukasa&#039;s really just an afterthought on account of the show focusing more on Isla and having Tsukasa rely on her for any semblance of character development.  Because the series doesn&#039;t actually focus on Tsukasa specifically most of the time, the amount of development he gets doesn&#039;t really go much in depth as I would&#039;ve liked, and as a result, has some points that really feel a bit unnatural.  (Cue end of episode 8.)  <br />
<br />
And then, there&#039;s Isla.  Isla as the main female protagonist in this series is a Giftia who hasn&#039;t been out in the field retrieving other Giftias on account of some events in the past.  At first, she&#039;s shown to be very robotic, acting almost like an android rather than a person.  But as the show goes on, we are revealed as to why she acts the way she does and we start to see the relationship between the two blossom, which actually does put some positive feeling back into the series.  But the problem I have with this is the fact that the show doesn&#039;t really use the time between the characters as proficiently as it could&#039;ve.  Several scenes, and even episodes are devoted for these two characters, but doesn&#039;t actually have much of an impact, resulting in wasted time.  I wish the show didn&#039;t begin focusing on strictly Isla till the very end, because like that, the show gets a progressional feel of character as you weave in points of character development through every episode.<br />
<br />
And then, the side cast.  As I had mentioned before, the side cast for Plamemo is separated into two groups, the Terminal Service, and the other families with Giftias ready for retrieval.  When it comes to the latter, that&#039;s when I feel like the show really shines because we have these connections between these Giftias and these people that our main characters have to break, leading to some dramatic and well-written scenes and moments.  It really ties into the show&#039;s central theme of memories and how they affect us, which is why I believe the show would&#039;ve done better if it spent most of its time in that regard.  It&#039;s a case of &quot;you won&#039;t remember their names, but you will remember their stories&quot;, which is something about Plamemo that I really like.  As for the terminal service people, they&#039;re really for the most part, comedic fodder.  There are several characters within this group that do have plot significance, like Kazuki, but for the most part, they&#039;re really just there to either move some part of the plot along, or create comedic moments.  I say this because a lot of them are pretty one-note.  (Aka, Michiru with her tsundere personality, Eru, who&#039;s pretty much just a pervert, the Terminal Service chief who sort of just complains about his family problems, and Yatsuka who basically just tries to hook Tsukasa up with girls.  Zack&#039;s teasing personality is great though.)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Retrieval targets are great characters<br />
+ Main character development is decent<br />

<br />
Art and Sound (8.28/10 and 7.45/10): The art for Plamemo was created by Doga Kobo, an animations studio that&#039;s been known to do a very specific style of animation involving a very light color palette and their signature adorable, pupiless eyes.  Similarly, Plamemo has the same kind of artstyle that feature more of a neon palette of colors, with all of the scenery and characters exhibiting a very bright look to them.  The show itself does look good, but it doesn&#039;t really scream to me that it&#039;s very outstanding for the most part.  Still though, there are some moments where I feel like the art really does go into these great looking scenes which is always a nice plus.  <br />
<br />
In terms of sound, Plamemo showcases a very wishful and pleasant sounding OP which I personally feel is one of the better OP&#039;s in Spring 2015.  It&#039;s a very calming song that really sings to the ideas of losing the ones whose memories you have while also having a very hopeful and mystical vibe to it, which brings it to be a decently memorable track to listen to.  As for the ED, the ED just feels a bit generic, with the song being a happy-go-lucky sounding song that I feel doesn&#039;t really have much of an impact or is all that impressive.  Good sounding, but it&#039;s not really all that memorable.<br />

<br />
Personal Enjoyment (7.01/10): When I first watched Plamemo in the beginning, I initially related it to Chobits, seeing as how both shows talk about the result of a super advanced android in the world where we see the effects that said android have on the state of the world overall, as seen with both shows utilizing stories of characters impacted by the androids.  But as I continued watching Plamemo, I was a bit confused as to why the show changed focus and eventually, I found it to be a bit boring, since the information that was given in the beginning had already written out its ending.<br />
<br />
Did I like this show?<br />
<br />
I in fact did enjoy this show to an extent.  As I have stated before, the parts where the show features stories of other Giftias and their lifespans were really I felt were the high point of the show.  They really related to the theme of the show fantastically, and I felt like the show itself was at its best when those stories were being told.  I also really liked the character Zack.  He teases everyone, and it&#039;s funny to see him tease the characters and see him just give an expression of him just not caring about the situation.  His comedy I think was the best.<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this show?<br />
<br />
The biggest thing that I didn&#039;t like about this anime was the fact that the show focused on Isla way too early.  The show flip flops with its plot focus, going from a random Giftia, to Isla, back to another Giftia, then back to Isla again before fixating itself on Isla for the rest of the show.  Personally, I felt like this broke up the flow of the show because while the show finished up one thing, it changed its tone completely before switching again, making it a bit of a weird watch because it was hard to tell whether the show was going to focus on one thing or the other.  The lack of development for the main characters also bothered me because I felt like the show should&#039;ve put a bit more into Tsukasa given how he&#039;s not really all that well explained in the series and how he mostly relies on Isla to have any semblance of  character development.  I was also not really fond of the fact that the show ended up turning into a rom-com because it felt a bit sudden that it just completely changed.  <br />
<br />
Would I recommend this show?<br />
<br />
While Plamemo isn&#039;t entirely perfect, the show itself still does talk about the themes of memories and their impact to people which is well written in some parts of the show.  It has some issues with the way it wants to structure itself, but it still is a good watch to one that enjoys a story of drama and loss.  (Though personally, I feel like the show is less sad than people actually make it out to be.)<br />
<br />
Overall Score: 7.42/10

    This is my first review. I tried my best to keep this as spoiler-free as possible. I felt compelled to write this because Pla-Memo is my favourite anime and I found it underrated, and the current reviews are also degrading its reputation. I watched Pla-Memo for the first time 3 months ago and after re-watching now I decided to write this review, I haven&#039;t changed my mind that this is my overall favourite anime.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10. First of all, the anime perfectly complies with its genres stated. The drama is really great, one can feel it even in the very first episode. Later on, the romance

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247717">
        becomes also astonishingly remarkable. And of course the plot itself is Sci-Fi as the anime is being held in some future where the &quot;Giftias&quot; become fashionable. I found many people disliking the idea of the &quot;Robot-human&quot;, yes it is over-powered and may be dangerous,  but Giftias do have many advantages. Most importantly, Pla-Memo is different from any other drama anime, it is unique, the idea of giftias itself differentiates it from the mainstream drama like characters simply dying for instance. The plot is outstanding. There is also a very wide variety of events happening in merely 13 episodes, I was surprised the first time I completed the series. The first half of the season mainly focuses on introducing you to the life of the characters and their job at SAI Terminal Service. After this comes the more intense romance part, I found it just flawless. After watching the last episode you&#039;ll get me. Of course there were also comedy components in each episode.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10. There is not a great range of music but quality is definitely present. The opening theme and ending theme have great potential of bringing tears after you completed the series. You can even notice slight changes after each episode if you watch closely. Of course as it is a drama, there are so many sad songs, they fit superbly though. The other sounds are also very well-organised; you can get chills, there are screams, cries, laughter, but very co-ordinated balance.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10. Isla and Tsukasa are in the spotlight for the anime. Isla is one of my favourite characters, she is a short and clumsy giftia but has human feelings. Her past is extremely riveting, and how it is revealed throughout the anime and how her character gradually changes is so satisfying to watch. Tsukasa is not really a superlative character but he is very considerate, he greatly cares for his partner. Besides the two leading characters, we have the duo of Michiru and Zack, if one has read the manga beforehand, the presence of these two fellows can be even more entertaining while watching the anime. Michiru, the classic tsundere, and Zack casually making fun of her is so fun to watch. I also liked all the other members of their circle, Yasutaka is here for the comedy, Sherry for the seriousness, Constance is a very nice guy... and Kazuki actually plays an exceptionally important role, both in guiding the main protagonists to do their job smoothly as well as in buttressing their personal relationship. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10. The first time I completed this anime was in one-sitting of about 4 hours (from 8pm to past-midnight more precisely). It was extraordinarily emotional, &quot;the feels&quot; were real ! I felt the &quot;depression feeling&quot; that I rarely get after watching a drama (until now, only Pla-Memo and Clannad: After-Story made me feel so, comparingly, Angel Beats, AnoHana and Your Lie in April are nothing, thats my opinion). You even realise some very true stuff about life itself, I can relate, for example, like Isla&#039;s quote: &quot;Having happy and beautiful memories don&#039;t always bring you salvation. The more beautiful a memory is, the more painful it can become.&quot; That was deep. Yet, until now I did not come across any anime as beautiful as Pla-Memo, certainly that is my own idea, but all of this review is to encourage those who haven&#039;t checked the anime yet to go and watch it. However, if you do not wanna cry or get depressed, I may recommend you NOT to try this. Pla-Memo is a passionate drama, I privately love drama/romance genres like this (though this anime is distinctively special). Still, I am not saying that you are forced to cry while watching this, its all about opinions, but it is a fact that the emotions are greatly present and if you are a romantic-drama fan, it is definitely worth the try!<br />
<br />
Overall 10/10

    This show was beautiful. I loved it. Nothing was wrong with it. The art was pretty, the story was creative, and amazing, the characters were so sweet, and strong, etc. Nothing was bad, everything was perfect. It was funny at some parts, and very sad at some parts. Im so glad I watched this, and you guys should watch it too. I was a big crybaby when I watched it. Its a 10/10 for me, this show was an inspiration. Please guys, check this show out, you will fall in love with it, because it is one of the best romances ever.

    I had high hopes for anime with this idea, but seeing how things are going its not looking good.<br />
the company that our main character is working for is completely incompetent and would never work in real life what so ever. My case in point is their lack of a manual, a lack of a tour and explanation of their product and how things work to the new employes.<br />
I can forgive the main character for not knowing anything about the giftia but for a company to not even have a manual for its new employes to read and find out how the giftia function and what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187739">
        is expected of both the human and giftia, on top of all this the company failed to notify the office that the main character will be working with so they did not have a partner for him.<br />
<br />
Now on to the poor guys coworkers, who mind you are not any better then the higher ups. They fail to tell him that his partner has only so many hours of run time left and that is why she is messing up so much, as a matter of fact they seem to all be rather bland character just there to be in the background and do nothing but provide the info our main character needs when the plot demands it to be so.<br />
This gives the whole show a rather scripted feel and I have no incentive to find out anything more about the world or the characters because of it, speaking of scripted.<br />
It seems non of the people who buy Giftia know that those things have a 9 year and 4 month running time, if this is another poor choice of the company or just scripted to add more &quot;emotion&quot; to the other wise bland show. I do not know which it is but both are just as bad.<br />
<br />
one good thing it has is its sound and art, the art really matches the little feeling there is and all the feelings you do get are from the sound which matches very nicely.<br />
I would recomand this to any storyboard writer to know what not to do but that is about it.

    &quot;I hope one day you&#039;ll be reunited with the one you cherish.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don’t want to provide that much of a spoiler, so my review will be rather short.<br />
<br />
Plastic memories, a popular anime known for its amazing story that will cry one&#039;s heart out. This anime is set in the world where giftias and humans live together. Maybe you’re wondering, what are giftias? Apparently, giftias are like humans, but with determined lifespans. Once they reach their limit, they need to be retrieved or else they’ll turn into a wanderer. Wanderer is a state where giftias can&#039;t control themselves anymore that they will start to go berserk.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407873">
        There’s this one company that specializes in retrieving those giftias. The main character, Tsukasa, is placed in that work. Because he’s a human, he needs to be partnered with a giftia and that giftia is Isla, the main heroine of this series. The journey starts from here. <br />
<br />
There’s one aspect that wins over my heart the most, which is the soundtrack. This is the key factor in making this anime a sad show. They’re so magical that it makes you want to burst into tears by just listening to them. Storywise, I think it’s not the best out there. There are tons of anime out there that have an overall better story. One thing I want to point out is how the anime ends. It’s so predictable that it turns out to be unexpected. If you’re expecting a twist, you came to the wrong series to watch. Well, it doesn&#039;t really matter because I shed tears in the end anyway. As for the art, I think it’s decent. Definitely not the best, but it’s still enjoyable overall.<br />
<br />
All of all, I think Plastic Memories is a very good show. The story is safe for beginners, so I can surely recommend this for everyone who’s into sad anime. <br />

    I&#039;m going to be short and to the point: It&#039;s entertaining and gut-wrenching at the same time, like a rollercoaster ride that actually ends properly instead of throwing you off a cliff and slap a &#039;to be continued&#039; arrow sign on top of the freeze-frame.<br />
<br />
If you want to immerse yourself into a short and bittersweet lovestory, this is it. There&#039;s no contradicting plot points nor convoluted character developement. Although there are some inappropriate jokes here and there, I see them as tension breakers that reminds you &quot;this ain&#039;t some School Days trash, we aren&#039;t gonna stab your heart til it&#039;s mush... yet&quot;<br />
<br />
Predictable story? No shit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320777">
        they pretty much tell you what&#039;s going to happen in the end right in the beginning. You also know how the rollercoaster&#039;s routes gonna pan out, but that doesn&#039;t make the ride any less fun. Also to those who say the female protagonist is just an architype of kuudere/tsundere, try to pay attention next time they reveal character motivations in any series okay? <br />
<br />
I won&#039;t be able to explain this without spoiling a tiny bit of the story so here we go:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You good? Okay. So... She is going to die, so to speak. She can&#039;t lash out or party like there&#039;s no tomorrow neither, because she is not a human. She has no rights to be capricious, and is forced to keep working until the day she loses the sense of herself completely. She seems like a kuudere because she doesn&#039;t want to relate to any more people, so it doesn&#039;t hurt her even more when she goes. Also because she doesn&#039;t want to hurt the people she interact with any more when the inevitable happens. But as cheesy as it sounds, love is blind. So she slowly opens up as the relationship progresses. kuuderes have no emotions whatsoever, and tsunderes have that distinct screech you can hear from miles away. She is neither, she is an AI even more human than most human-beings she interacts with. And she is the most precious little potato ever.

    I feel like this is a rather underrated anime. People watch the first episode of this and do away with it because they feel like they already know how it’s going to end. I believe that despite this, it should still be watched through completely because this anime is filled with a lot of emotion and doesn’t have a bad or bull sh*t ending. Anyone who rated it a 7 or below should probably rewatch it and see that it’s not as flawed as they believe.<br />
<br />
Story: (9.5/10)<br />
I found the story of this anime rather interesting and unique. Imagine knowing the exact time that a loved

        one would die; it would be heartbreaking and a terrifying thing to think about for them to wait until their time has come. Although i think it could’ve probably gotten a bit more in depth, but I’ll forgive this flaw do to the fact that it’s a romance anime and a great on at that. The story also allows you to appreciate the time you have with the ones you love more.<br />
<br />
Art: (10/10)<br />
The art in Plastic Memories is phenomenal it has a nice variety of colors and it properly sets the mood at certain points within the anime.<br />
<br />
Sound: (10/10)<br />
The opening is a great song that builds up emotions (especially when you look at the English translation on YouTube) and changes a slight bit as the anime progresses, the ending song is also very well done and is enjoyable enough to refrain from skipping, and the soundtrack in general along with the song “Again and Again” (one of the best songs in the anime). The voice acting is also good and fits the characters quite well.<br />
<br />
Characters: (7.75/10)<br />
Despite how much I love PlaMemo, I do believe that Doga Koba could’ve fleshed out the characters more. They did a good job on Isla by giving us a better understanding of her on why she is the way she is and her way of thinking. Tsukasa was an okay character. He was understanding and good person, but the problem was he wasn’t given a backstory at all, which was quite disappointing considering he was a main character. Kazuki was given a bit of a backstory which was nice but she wasn’t really around enough in the anime to be properly developed. Michiru was done decently as a character and was also given a good backstory along with her interactions and relationships with the other characters which made her enjoyable; although, I wish that she could’ve had more interactions with Isla and Tsukasa. Finally, the Giftias that they retrieve and people that own them. I believe that they had good relations with each in the fact that they didn’t want to let go because the Giftias were family to the people. They have a genuine bond with each other and it really gets you to feel for them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (10/10)<br />
Plastic Memories made me cry at the end of almost every episode, making it the closest anime to even try to challenge Clannad: After Story in terms of sadness. It’s serious when it needs to be but is also funny at times which is nice. I feel like it was a rather realistic romance anime where a relationship is properly built over time (for Isla at least). I fell in love with the characters and really felt for their struggles. The ending was perfect in my opinion (the very end that is). The anime didn’t feel boring to me whatsoever and every bit was worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Overall (10/10)<br />
This anime will make you cry and feel a void in your heart by the end. I highly recommend this anime to all, but don’t nitpick every little bit until after you finish in order to get the best experience out of this. The characters were pretty decent, the art was amazing, the sound was perfect, the story was really good, and it was really enjoyable.
