    Make no mistake, if there&#039;s anything of the next big thing for hardcore fans of Jun Mochizuki to receive an anime adaptation of her immaculate work that properly does its translation onto the small screen well, we finally got it in &quot;Vanitas no Carte&quot; (a.k.a The Case Study of Vanitas). And as someone who had watched the Pandora Hearts adaptation and felt somewhat burned by the last stretch (go read the manga, it&#039;s literally better), I&#039;d say that how Vanitas started out (at least for the 1st half here) made me remember how much I initially love about Pandora Hearts in both AniManga forms in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416983">
        its deep, rich lore and constant, not-clickbait, smooth, condescending plot twists that Jun Mochizuki is famously known for.<br />
<br />
To properly explain what Vanitas no Carte is all about from the perspectives of both sides of the coin that did and didn&#039;t read Pandora Hearts before, the basis is this: Jun Mochizuki likes to keep the setting as simple, but let the characters flow slowly but extensively with complexity, and be weaved into its intriguing story and plot that will keep you invested in the material for as long as it does service on the countless rhetorics it likes to consistently build up in its course run. And just like how Pandora Hearts had the setting of an &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; imagination, Vanitas starts out being this 19th Century steampunk aesthetic of Paris about the world of vampires and humans living alongside one another in total secrecy. Think last season&#039;s Mars Red, but better executed overall in terms of its hypotheses, which contributes to its likeness of how Jun Mochizuki likes to intersect both serious and comedic relief moments to even out her subtle characterizations to give some breathing room. It&#039;s also a detective show, which is centered around &quot;The Vampire of the Blue Moon&quot; Vanitas himself, creating the &quot;Book of Vanitas&quot; grimoire to one day bring retribution to the traditional vampires whom have scorned his existence: &quot;The Vampires of the Red Moon&quot;. And in comes this unassuming vampire by the name of Noé Archiviste, whom seeks this illusive book to save vampires from their predicament of becoming &quot;curse-bearers&quot; via malnomen: name-corrupted vampires of uncontrolled blood lust. And oh look, since the human doctor-claiming Vanitas&#039;s goals and objectives aligns with Noe&#039;s, there begins their quest to be vampire doctors to save other vampires from being cursed by Charlatans. Seems simple and not overly complex enough, init?<br />
<br />
As with any Jun Mochzuki work, she loves characterization to an insane degree, and more than the subtle story that Vanitas provides, it&#039;s the characters that shine the best in their given like-mindedness, being on either side of protags or antags. Everyone has the 5W1Hs reasoning of their existence in this story, and nothing feels displaced, adding up to the testament that the constant plot twists will always throw you off with what to expect in both action and dialogue forms. And this is very evident on no small part of the protagonists Vanitas and Noé. Right off the bat, you would think that Vanitas, the name being inherited from the same &quot;Vanitas of the Blue Moon&quot; legend and its infamous text of healing through his grimoire as a vampire, his name would obviously be a mainstay to those whom have heard of the legend past. But nope, as much as the self-proclaimed vampire doctor that Vanitas is, he&#039;s an ordinary looking human with a sinister past that&#039;s perfectly hidden from his usual stance of a kind demeanor. The underlying truth is that the human Vanitas was a guinea pig of vampire experiments, done in no small part of his parents being exterminated by vampires and taken in by this Church-devoted, anti-vampire slaying group known as the Chasseurs to be performed ruthless experiments on which cost him part of his humanity. It&#039;s the reason why we don&#039;t see Vanitas much being cold to the people working alongside him in human Paris, where the vampire world of the alternate Altus Paris is where much of the story actually takes place in to give some context to Vanitas&#039;s sidekick that is Noé. A member of the Archivist Clan, simultaneously a true vampire and child of the Shapeless One with his &quot;the Fangs that Lay Bare Blood&quot; ability to discern people&#039;s memories from drinking their blood, Noé is a true white-haired beauty of a handsome Ikemen, if like Vanitas, accounting for a similar dissonance of a past with friends being curse-bearers and having to live through a frightening situation where the execution sentence only awaits their salvation. Since then, Noé has lived through a recluse of moments trying to undermine the Charlatans and their objectives by seeking out the Book of Vanitas, which as mentioned before, is able to relieve corrupt vampires from their curses.<br />
<br />
What Jun Mochzuki has done here with the characters, it&#039;s such an astounding beauty worthy of a &quot;Case Study&quot;-like breakdown of a work. Since Vanitas and Noé&#039;s character chemistry is the most important base foundation of the series, it doesn&#039;t feel forced to see that both of these handsome-looking guys with their inadvertently back-and-forth comedy-cum-serious conflict banter provides a sense of depth into portraying what lies beneath the rabbit&#039;s hole (giving the reference to Pandora Hearts). This kind of relationship is no doubt special, made by the fact that both of their lives were tarnished by vampires of different kinds, and the claim to eke out salvation through the use of the &quot;Book of Vanitas&quot; grimoire is such an intriguing backstory, all things considered. Don&#039;t try to read too much into the story as you will not be amused by its overarching, bland-ish concept, but pay special attention to the characters and how each and everyone of them gels like spider threads to this mystery that is like the gift that keeps on giving. Characters like Lucius &quot;Luca&quot; Oriflamme, Hellfire Witch Jeanne (which serves as Luca&#039;s chevalier and Vanitas&#039;s love interest), Noé&#039;s &quot;childhood friend&quot;-cum-engaged Dominique &quot;Domi&quot; de Sade and many more delves deep into how they are interconnected to the main duo in all circumstances, and how they are existentiality fighting for similar goals to quench the Charlatans while keeping both sides of Paris safe from harm. If there&#039;s are a few aspects that you can love about Vanitas no Carte, it&#039;s the retrospection and subtle foreshadowing of keeping the story cohesive, while the plot remains complex and unpredictable, while characters influence the plot which pushes characters to act and develop. There are clear protagonists and motivators, but the story is much bigger than themselves, and almost everyone at least had a chance to make a terrible mistake, which doubles down on being emotionally invested and connected in the tonal shifts of the characters that&#039;s played out like a Shakespeare play. A complication of human-feeling motifs and motives, but a much-needed one for first impressions to dig into this detective story.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d never thought that Jun Mochizuki&#039;s illustrations could be bested by anime productions, but since this is Bones, and they do have the capacity to do so, thanks to famed Monogatari director Tomoyuki Itamura and chief animation director-cum-character designer Yoshiyuki Itou. Both of these men have years of invaluable experiences helming the series under their belt to different degrees of success, and now that they&#039;re collaborating together on this project, it&#039;s no wonder that Vanitas gives off a very Monogatari-esque kind of vibe, while Itou&#039;s designs on the anime looks so grandoise that adds to the world-building within the show. It&#039;s simply a delight to see Bones flex its production values best (that&#039;s not just relegated to the juggernaut that is My Hero Academia alone). Even with some occasional production hiccups *cough* double-digit episode directors *cough* it still delivers on content and action alone for the long-haul investment.<br />
<br />
The music though, really is something else. OST fanatics will know the absolute one-trick pony Goddess of music composition that is composer Yuki Kaijura, and believe it or not, her extensive biography even dates back to the anime adaptation of Pandora Hearts (aside from the Type-Moon Fate franchise which solidified her position even more). Any project that has her name plastered on it is already certified akin to platinum statuses and for good reason, and Vanitas has that Yuki Kaijura flare to it that never disappoints at all. For the OP, Sasanomaly hasn&#039;t been in this scene much from his last debut song that is Natsume Yuujinchou Season 5&#039;s OP, and that was back in 2016. To come back 5 years later with this soothing song of a slick OP, it is a pretty good song that&#039;s worth a listen. Even with the ED, this is LMYK&#039;s 2nd song (her debut was for a Chinese movie), and &quot;0 (zero)&quot; is another soothing song of a classical, modern ED. Seriously though, what&#039;s up with these unknown and future stars being laid dormant in the background, because their music is really good. Definitely a masterclass aspect of Vanitas overall.<br />
<br />
As evident from the past work that is Pandora Hearts, it&#039;s very hard to get a sublime and intricate work like Jun Mochizuki&#039;s adapted right, and I&#039;ve seen a few fair shares of manga readers complaining even the most minor of details that are being cut out of the anime that adds to the overall sense of deplorability that the manga heavily banks on to tells its coherent story. But as an anime-only, I can attest to the fact that even without these details, as a standalone product, Vanitas is at heart, a conspiracy manoeuvre of a delicate balance between surrealism and reality. The exploration of humanity at its best and worst, human or vampire, a keen sense of engrossment with enthralling obsession just will not do, and I&#039;m very looking forward to the 2nd Cour when it drops to continue that journey down the rabbit hole.

    What&#039;s fascinating about bringing a manga into anime form is the expression of its ideas onto the television screen. Jun Mochizuki is best known for her work, Pandoras Hearts and she&#039;s able to communicate her wealth of ideas to her fans. In respect, she&#039;s able to formulate together a fictional setting with colorful characters and ultimately create this piece of work known as Vanitas no Carte.<br />
<br />
Vanitas no Carte (or its English title &#039;The Case Study of Vanitas&#039;) takes place in France that adheres to a steampunk fantasy. Studio Bones helms the show with director Tomoyuki Itamura at the steering wheel. You&#039;d think a guy who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416997">
        has been involved with the Monogatari franchise to bring its witty dialogues this show. However, Vanitas no Carte sells its beyond talking and characer interactions. Watching the show equates to an elegant setting of fantasy, drama, and a whole lot of pretty boys. <br />
<br />
Based on the manga, we meet Vanitas, a young man with vampire blood in his veins after a certain incident. In possession of the sacred The Book of Vanitas, he claims to be able to cure vampires. Fate would have it as he crosses paths with Noe, a vampire who seeks the book for himself. And together, we follow their quest in Paris, France, a setting of mystery and secrets. From most people&#039;s point of view, it&#039;s easy to label the show as a supernatural drama. After all, we are introduced to vampires, one of the most overused monsters even in the anime medium. However, this show managed to captivate me through its sheer storytelling from the first episode. We got a seemingly elegant airship that turns into a nightmare with the presence of vampires. Blood is spilled and we realize the stakes of the story. On the other hand, Vanitas is confident enough to call himself a doctor for the vampire curse. Can you believe it? Maybe not from the first episode but as we learn more about Vanitas, the more we can understand what the author wants to show us. <br />
<br />
Vanitas himself is a confident character with a colorful amount of charisma. His personality is displayed as playful, sarcastic, and can be quite mischievious. He&#039;s a character who is hard to read based on emotions. Sometimes, you have to wonder if anything he says can be taken seriously. However, Vanitas&#039; role shows he knows more than we think and has an important connection to his book. The relationship between him and Noe is perhaps one of the most entertaining element in the show for their conflicting personalities. Let&#039;s face it, the two fight like siblings and seems like they always have something to fight about. Although their relationship evolves throughout the show, it&#039;s still at times hard to see them eye to eye. But that&#039;s also what&#039;s entertaining about the show. Injecting toxicity into a relationship brings entertainment and it&#039;s the type of toxicity that doesn&#039;t rub off itself. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, other characters emerges from the show with elegance of various degrees. Jeanne, aka The Hellfire Witch, attracts the attention of Vanitas who decided to confess to her upon their meeting. The aristocrat Domi shares an unique relationship with Noe and upon their on-screen appearance, she wants him a taste of her blood. Unfortunately, beyond Vanitas, Noe, Jeanne, and Domi, most of the other cast are overshadowed by their sheer presence. It&#039;s not that other characters are ignored by the author but that these four has much more aura and mystique. We also get a glimpse of Vanitas&#039; past and Noe and Domi&#039;s peculiar relationship. On the other hand, Jeanne is cast into the show as perhaps as the most feminine character you can find. When you get an anime filled with pretty boys, there&#039;s also room for pretty girls, right? Of course, this anime isn&#039;t shy to give out kiss scenes and moments that make the fangirl in you scream.<br />
<br />
Despite the various degrees of light comedy, Vanitas no Carte is to be taken as a serious show. Beyond the humor lies an anime of dark secrets. We find out more and more about the origins of vampires, the purpose of the Book of Vanitas, and even secrets we may not want to know. However, do also realize that this is just the first season and it&#039;s meant more as a setup and introduction of the overall anime&#039;s themes and ideas. When the adaptation was announced, it was already set up to run more than one cour. In order to adequately tell its story, it had to be expanded this way given the amount of chapters and volumes from the manga. So yes, be patient. This first season isn&#039;t here to drop you into everything the world it has to offer.<br />
<br />
Anyone familiar with Mochizuki&#039;s past work will draw similarities in her character designs. Yes, this anime has very pretty characters. That&#039;s perhaps an understatement when we see the aristocrat society. The male cast has their bishounen look while the ladies draws you into with their elegance. Let&#039;s face it, most of the cast look attractive and it&#039;s just how the author wants you to feel when watching their every scene. We also behold our eyes on the beautiful setting that is France. It&#039;s a place of mystique and the first episode shouldn&#039;t take long for you to take it in. Take a deep breath because Vanitas no Carte is no shortstop in the visual quality department. Similarly, the voice actors does a phenomenal job at protraying their respective characters. From the playful voice tone of Vanitas to the lady-like mannerisms of Domi, you can truly believe the characters are who they are.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t believe it takes an award winning writer to create a series such as Vanitas no Carte. Yet, Jun Mochizuki is able to convince me to follow her legacy. This show has proven itself that she can make a fictional world in a steampunk setting and create a beautiful cast. Whether you agree with  her ideas is another thing. But let&#039;s face it, Vanitas no Carte is how a supernatural drama should be.

    All good things must come to an end but in Vanitas case it’s just begun<br />
<br />
On A side note If you are looking for long shounen fights, an idealistic protagonist, one objective and goal for which everyone works for and if you dislike slow burners, dialogue Then drop down. This series is not for you!<br />
<br />
Synopsis is already there so I am not gonna bother with it.<br />
Each story has different strengths.<br />
In Vanitas case, it’s the writing style itself. The author Jun uses drip feeding technique and she is extremely talented in doing so and anyone familiar knows what I am referring to. and due to this Everything

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416993">
        in the world of Vanitas from characters to plot and the world itself is a mystery.<br />
Don’t let some common tropes mislead you!(The writer is pretty famous for that)<br />
Vanitas is not your typical vampire story<br />
In other words, Vampires are not blood sucking parasites which is pretty common in vampire stories. Turning into a blood sucking parasite though is a huge crime. But they are still vampires so yup there are occasional blood sucking scenes.<br />
The world building is unique and is done extremely well but at the same time not entirely revealed (Drip feeding). And You always learn something new while you are moving ahead in the story and that makes it intriguing to say the least.<br />
The power system of the series has to be interpreted through several hints and it is explained occasionally when it needs to be (World formula theory, vampire eyes and the book of Vanitas are based on altering the formula to do something) and it too is quite unique.<br />
As far as comedy goes (For now only) its either a hit or a miss but that being said, the comedy is actually good (Unlike Jujutsu kaisen, demon slayer or any other common shounen comedy you can think of). The author basically uses the comedic factors in order to balance the overall tone of the 1st cour/half of the story since after that its quite dark. With that being said it doesn’t become overdramatic or overly emotional and is pretty much balanced.<br />
<br />
 The characters of Vanitas are very well crafted. They are not your Typical shounen protagonists or characters and majority of them including the mains are 18 or 18+ in other words it has primarily adult cast. There is no good or evil regarding them because every character has deep rooted motivations and ideologies which make them correct and their actions logical (With an exception of some). The best characters being Vanitas and Noe the 2 main characters of the series.  The contradicting ideologies of the 2 main characters but how they are able to work together and make each other “whole” makes their dynamic a treat to watch/read. Other than that, the expressions and dialogues regarding the characters are extremely important. That being said the characters are a mystery and its extremely important to pay attention to their expressions and dialogues to learn about them. That gives hints to why they are like that in the first place. <br />
<br />
On a side note, the chibi is mostly Bones original with an exception of a few scenes.<br />
With that being said and done<br />
This is basically the beginning of the case or should I say the tragedy of Vanitas. <br />
<br />
What can first time viewers can expect?<br />
The plot twists haven’t began yet so without counting that they can expect an original story with a few tropes here and there, good dynamics, Great Music(Yuki kaijura) and a developing mystery and several raised questions waiting to be answered later on while watching or completing the first cour<br />
So considering the writing style and everything about the series and how it executes everything, I personally believe it deserves a 10.<br />

    I&#039;ll keep this short and sweet: (NO SPOILERS)<br />
<br />
You&#039;ll love this show if you&#039;re into vampires, male duos that are practically begging their fans to ship them together, and mystery anime that will leave the comment sections filled with manga readers excitedly answering your curious questions and hypotheses. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a better, more upbeat Mars Red with regular comedic relief and a more modern touch.<br />
It has a detective vibe as well which is why I&#039;m liking each new episode more than the last.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
The 1st two episodes were nothing special, and I only watched the 3rd episode because I saw some hype about it on Instagram.<br />
<br />
The 4th

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409597">
        episode, however has me hooked and looking forward to seeing what everyone&#039;s true intentions actually are.<br />
The romance is refreshing...I may be a psycho, but vampires showing affection in the most stereotypical way is a sight to behold.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
The charismatic class clown who laughs at anything and everything remotely funny meets your girlfriend&#039;s new reliable, morally sound and well-mannered husbando.<br />
The characters are nothing we haven&#039;t seen before, however, the voice casting is so damn good that makes the characters worth watching as they blend incredibly well into their world.<br />
I care about what happens to the characters, you will too.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
Beautiful?<br />
Definitely above average, but nothing out of this world.<br />
The sakuga is quite good though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
The OP and ED are both next level beautiful, and the OST makes each dramatic scene a little more captivating.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, Vanitas no Carte is one of the better anime of this season.<br />
I&#039;d definitely recommend watching this when whatever you&#039;re currently watching grows a little too overwhelming and you&#039;re in need of a change in pace.

    It’s been a while since I’ve managed to sat down and watch an entire vampire anime and enjoyed it at the same time. No disrespect to people to people who liked Mars Red last season, it just didn’t grab me. But how did this one grab me then? Well you set it in Paris, have some sexy men in there, make the two leads a dynamic duo and have an ED you don’t want to skip. But that is only the baseline, let’s go into more detail as to how this show was one of the bright spots in this okay summer season. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sit back,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417015">
        relax and get the weirdest arousal while being bitten by a vampire as I present to you the anime review for The Case Study of Vanitas. Let’s begin shall we? <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
<br />
Set in 19th century Paris, we follow a vampire by the name of Noé who is searching for a grimoire called the “Book of Vanitas,” which was created by a vampire born under the blue moon rather than the red moon vampires are usually born under. During a vampire attack, Noé runs into a human who calls himself Vanitas with the titular grimoire in hand that is able to return the sanity of vampires who have become cursed. With Noé fascinated by Vanitas, he joins Vanitas in his objectives to save all vampires. <br />
<br />
It’s a solid baseline to go off as to how Vanitas will save the vampires and all the misadventures that Noé and Vanitas get up to. The story is comprised of small arcs that contain different cases related to vampires and there is usually a bigger picture to each of them. Each of them different as well which helps establish the world better as we discover more secrets and reveals that help get to know what kind of world where humans and vampires coexist. <br />
<br />
But I wouldn’t say the story of this show is a main selling point. Don’t get me wrong, it’s solid and there are interesting narrative beats, but it does lack that big overarching narrative that acts as a core pillar for the story. You do obviously have Vanitas wanting to save the vampires but the bigger picture of that doesn’t go very far. The story is best in the moment to moment scenes and how our characters interact with it. Now there is an interesting narrative reveal at the end of episode one that acts as interesting plotpoint but I don’t think that will be a major point in the story until season two. <br />
<br />
Another thing I want to point out is the tone of the series because I think some people might think it’s inconsistent. I think it strikes a nice balance and it is established early on it does have a quirky attitude which I do think gives the series its charm and gives it a good sense of humour. Now that it is carried by it’s great cast of characters to carry that humour. Speaking of which, let’s talk about them. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 9.5/10<br />
<br />
The characters are probably the best thing about this show (Well that and the ED but we will get to that). Noé and Vanitas really do make a very dynamic duo and their chemistry with each other is brilliant.  Noé’s is a thoughtful man with a child like curiosity which leads him to be fascinated by Vanitas and his ambitions. Yet on paper, his character traits wouldn’t work with Vanitas on paper. You see, Vanitas is an arrogant, self absorbed s**tsterer who can’t seem to stay out of trouble. Yet the chemistry between our two main leads is so good. They bounce off each other really well and the scenes where it is just them two make for some of the best in this show. They feel like two separate people and their personalities and moralities clash time and time again which helps each character grow and help both understand each other.<br />
<br />
This is also helped by the fact that this show has a great supporting cast around them, which also has personalities and traits that bounce of out main leads well and help with the show’s quirky tone. Characters like Jeanne, Domi, Roland and Louis have likeable traits to make them standout characters on their own. Jeanne for example is a very dangerous vampire with a lot of power but gets easily smittened by Vanitas’ words, leading to their chemistry work so well with one another. No matter how big or small their role, these supporting characters leave their mark really well and work well with our two main leads. <br />
<br />
<br />
Animation: 8/10<br />
<br />
When you see Bones attached to an anime, you expect quality and that is exactly what we get. Vanitas looks great with good animation and some great art style. You can definitely tell by some shots that this is a Bones made anime. The animation itself is solid and does a good job with the photography to make a scene more dramatic. I do love the animation when Vanitas uses the Grimoire. Makes it look like he’s opening something that should never be opened. Then there are the vampire biting scenes which seem to make them more erotic than they need to be; which lead to me awakening some dormant fetishes (Stupid sexy Angel). Admit it, you got weirdly aroused by that biting scene at the end of episode 4. <br />
<br />
The show does have some really impressive backgrounds as well at times. Paris looks great, especially at night and very thematic for the time period. I also like the character designs that help make the character distinct. Vanitas in his big trench coat, black gloves hiding some claw like nails and with a hint of blue to go with his design, symbolising the vampire born under the blue moon. Noé’s all white look with the purple eyes that can glow red, representing the vampire born under the red moon and make it a sort of ying and yang look between Noé and Vanitas. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
Well it certainly sounds very French, which is very thematic, considering the setting. While it can sound generic, it does at least try to vary itself so it does not blend into one another. While it may use the same instruments, it’s in how they are used that makes it more unique. It does match the tone of the scene by changing how fast or slow the instruments are; which is notable on some instruments like the accordion. So despite it sounding as you would expect, it is good and varied enough to like its soundtrack. This is done by Yuki Kajiura so you expect it to be good at minimum. <br />
<br />
The opening is alright. Actually no, it’s good, simply put. &quot;Sora to Utsuro&quot; by Sasanomaly, captures the quirky side of the show and shows off the character’s personalities very well. You can get a gage as to how the characters will interact with one another and the world itself. The song itself is alright but it is the visuals that carry this OP and it does do a good job at it. <br />
<br />
But the real star of the show besides its characters is its ED. In fact, the main reason why I wanted to do this review was to simply gush about this ED. It is really, really, REALLY good. &quot;0 (zero)&quot; by LMYK is easily best ED of the season. Quite possibly of the year but it’s got some stiff competition from Mars Red’s “On My Own” by Hyde. Which ironically, is another vampire anime. LMYK puts in a fantastic vocal performance with a rhythm that is so perfect, it’s easily to groove along to. Visuals are nice to with Noé’ reaching out to Vanitas like he doesn’t want him to leave his side. What’s also cool about this ED is that there is both a Japanese and English version of the song. Both are fantastic so pick what you prefer. This ED outshines all other EDs this season. I think it is that good.   I expect a bloodbath between this ED and Mars Red’s ED for ED of the year. So yeah, best ED of the season. <br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion: <br />
<br />
I would probably consider The Case of Vanitas to be my anime of the season and why not? Everything it does is at least good and there are things here it excels at doing to give that edge over other anime this season. It’s cast of characters, art direction and its ED are the main selling points that make this show enjoyable while the other aspects of this show aren’t holding it back either. It looks great, Noé’ and Vanitas are likeable characters and have great characters and again, that ED is so damn good. I’ve already added it to my playlist of personal favourite OPs and EDs. It really is just a great show all round and in a solid but underwhelming Summer 2021 (when comparing to the previous two seasons), this is easily one of the standouts. It’s worth a watch if you haven’t already and it’s nice to have a second season to look forward to as well. <br />
<br />
Do I think it could be better? Well the overarching story could be more interesting but the rest would just be simple nitpicks that wouldn’t be worth discussing. This show is great and is certainly worth your time. Now we will see how season two will pan out. <br />
<br />
<br />
My Personal Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall Score: 8.3/10  Recommendation: Watch it

    Of all the things you can criticize this show for, you certainly can’t fault it for false advertising. You expect vampire yaoi-bait full of pretty boys blushing, pretty boys hand-holding, pretty boys naked, pretty boys with weirdly intimate physical relationships, pretty boys kissing submissive girls, pretty boys LICKING submissive girls, and whatever else it takes to fuel the fires of fujoshi fanfiction, and that’s exactly what you get. Aside from all the heavy breathing, sensual moaning, and sexy blood-sucking, this show is about Vanitas and Noé, two men on a mission to save all vampires. From what? I dunno. How? I dunno. Why? Actually, we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416975">
        do kinda learn Noé’s motivation, but other than that, their mission is kept intentionally vague so the story can meander around, not really doing much for all twelve episodes. The show insistently interrupts every serious scene with unfunny comedy or goofy facial expressions, suggesting the show isn’t really meant to be taken all that seriously, but it also has an info-dump or a flashback every episode, suggesting we should actually be taking notes. The presentation is just poorly planned, and the tone is all over the place. One minute Noé is having Vietnam flashbacks about this grotesque face-eating monster, and ten seconds later we’re joking around with clingy oujo-sama waifu again. The action scenes are also pretty lackluster. It’s just a bunch of assholes standing around spouting meaningless attack names, doing some flashy nonsense, and incapacitating the enemy without the show ever attempting to introduce a cohesive magic system or well-defined power scale. I’m gonna be totally honest, there were many times throughout this show where I didn’t really know what someone was talking about. The characters would go somewhere or start some conversation, and only then would I realize I had zoned out and didn’t understand the context behind what was happening. I’m not saying the details weren’t there. I’m just saying the show was too boring to communicate them to me. This is ironic because, in other instances, the show repeats itself way too much. It’s constantly reminding you of its cookie-cutter vampiric lore and completely failing to appreciate its own banality. Yuki Kajiura will be playing this tremendous piece of gothic music while Vanitas is giving this epic speech, the characters are acting like the world is falling down around them, and all I can think is, “I&#039;m sorry, but didn’t he already say that, like, two episodes ago?”<br />
<br />
This show made me realize Tomoyuki Itamura only ever seemed like a competent director because he was working under the tutelage of Akiyuki Shinbou and constantly in a state of imitating the Studio Shaft aesthetic which better, more unique directors like Tatsuya Oishi had helped to define, and I’m not happy. I thought it was just a coincidence when the same thing happened with Shin Ōnuma slowly over the course of the last decade and Yuki Yase literally the second he left, but I guess this is the fate of those who leave Shaft: washed-up at a worse studio and with zero style of their own, pumping out nothing but forgettable and painfully boring seasonal shlock. Visually, I can’t really say this show looks better than just alright. The average production quality of modern anime is just so low, it makes this look like something phenomenally impressive when it really isn’t. For Bones, though, I thought it looked quite good. I watched the first episode and thought, “well, there’s no way they’re going to keep up this level of costume detail,” and I was right. However, instead of doing what they usually do and making a wildly inconsistent mess with a few over-animated action scenes to trick people into thinking the rest of the show looks presentable when it really doesn’t, they actually balanced everything out and crafted a much more solid work of animation. Another pleasant surprise from Bones was the outstanding art direction. Usually, the backgrounds are the weakest part of any Bones show, but the art direction in this show is great, especially in the gorgeous opening animation, and it really brings the setting of Paris to life. The last time an anime set in France looked this good was Le Chevalier D’Eon, and that’s cheating because the studio was Production IG and the art director was Hiroshi Ōno. But sadly, these pretty visuals are limited by the lifeless directing. In the first episode, there was this scene of Vanitas and Noé fighting which was storyboarded so that a metal grate would momentarily obscure the shot, and I legitimately felt physically ill for recognizing it. I mean, out of all the Akiyuki Shinbou trademarks Itamura could’ve ripped-off to communicate the fact he has no directorial identity of his own, why choose one of the most famous visual tricks from Shinou’s post-90s legacy at Shaft? I don’t know, it just seemed pathetic to me. Frankly, the whole show is steeped in mediocrity, and while I can’t fault it for anything serious, I doubt I’ll remember it fondly, assuming the smut isn’t all I remember.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading.

    Having a good buddy that just loves the series. It really made me want to check it out and see for myself when it had gotten an anime. The thing is now. I love te series too, and here is why.<br />
<br />
Story and characters<br />
I&#039;m lumping these two in together, and it&#039;s mainly the cast that pull the show so far, and the reason why it&#039;s so entertaining. Vanitas and Noe have such partnership, how they banter across from another, to how they interact with eac other in general. Providing some laughs, some shocking moments, but the main thing is, they just work so well together. They

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409572">
        aren&#039;t the only characters of course, but just from that alone, you can already tell it&#039;s a good cast, all from that. <br />
<br />
As for the story, the story is pretty to explain. It reminds me a bit of Mars Red from the previous season in terms of it&#039;s story, but done in a more comedic, fun, but serious manner. Which just makes the show super easy and fun to watch. But also makes it have more of an interest factor with it&#039;s story, and I do feel like we&#039;re going to get so much more as we go on. One moment, the story could be around something Vanitas is doing, but ten later, we could have a twist, and then another, which will just keep you on the edge of your seat. It&#039;s really well done. So you&#039;ll always feel like there is more to this story, which is only a good thing.<br />
<br />
Art and sound: Te art is very pretty to look at. As if they polished it really well, and just do well in every scene. From more dark scenes, to scenes with much more light. The outfits look dope, and it&#039;s all standing out nicely. While the sound? I mean, just give the OP a listen a few times, it&#039;s a banger, much like the reactions of the characters, and how the sounds fit each scene. Can&#039;t put a foot wrong here.<br />
<br />
You should give it a watch! It&#039;s been a fun ride so far, and it&#039;s only going to get even better.<br />

    There&#039;s a French saying, &quot;On ne connaît pas la vie, jusqu’à ce qu’on connaisse la mort!&quot;, which contextually translates to &quot;One does not know life, until they know death!&quot;<br />
<br />
This saying does not actually exist (if it does, then wow), and is a reminder that you should not take to heart any piece of information without even the smallest scepticism, especially when it is from online.<br />
<br />
Ok... what a way to start a review. What&#039;s the actual reasoning for doing such? <br />

The Case Study of Vanitas is this drama with timely enthusiasm to its name, for what it aims to be, at least, on a functional level, I believe it does well at presenting its name under such light. <br />
<br />
The narrative, set in the 19th-century world of vampires and humans. A human doctor, Vanitas, sincere but selfish, sets himself on this mission to save all vampires living, despite bearing the cursed moon&#039;s name. Accompanied by Noé, who is basically the Pinky to the Brain, the two go on this ambition Vanitas set for himself. Overall, the story is easy to follow, with it not being too much of a hassle to actually understand what is going on. It&#039;s a pretty linear narrative too, so I wouldn&#039;t go into this looking for anything elusive or secretive as that is a matter of non-existent material. Sure, you can look into characters, and I too try and guess why these characters do what they do, but overthinking this may not profit one, making things unnecessarily perplexing tends to backfire. Though, it brings to question, how exactly The Case Study of Vanitas plays in the realm of anime. Before I get onto that, I will comment on how the characters are indeed pretty good in themselves. Looking back on it though, they each have personality, yet are each devoid of intrinsic value, that&#039;s mostly true for anyone who isn&#039;t Vanitas or Noé though, the former being unnecessarily enigmatic, the latter being that dude whose entire life we spectate. Though everyone&#039;s gimmicks, predominantly the conspicuous Vanitas, they were something I always found fun is looking forward to viewing.<br />
<br />
So, I (possibly) tricked you into believing the earliest statement in this review, for a second reason, that reason is fraud. So I don&#039;t mean to shun down Bones by misinforming anyone that they are plagiarists or something silly like that, but the production of this anime contains nothing but Shaft vibes, in fact, the director (Itamura Tomoyuki) and one of the main musicians (Omnipotent Goddess - Kajiura Yuki) have literally been associates of large titles from Shaft (Monogatari, PMMM and more). Now, Bones does a good job holding the style, it is just that they aren&#039;t the style. It was close for sure, but it isn&#039;t what it isn&#039;t. Still, you can expect some A-tier animation from the studio that didn&#039;t really manage to make me raise eyebrows in correlation to inconsistencies to the quality. As for the sounds. It&#039;s Yuki Kajiura; 10/10. Also, Hanae Natsuki needs a raise, now.<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime was quite enjoyable and fun to watch, or if you like, you can feel that enthusiasm whilst viewing such. I would recommend this to all looking for something of a clean modern historical anime. It may hide behind facades, though, despite the misleading sins, I looked over it, and it was fun for sure. I am looking forward to season 2, waiting to see what that rapscallion Vanitas and his frivolous nature will bring. Since I have nothing of importance to touch off with, I am going to slide in another recommendation, &quot;Gosick&quot;, just because of the aesthetic this anime beholds, if you enjoy this and won&#039;t complain on a critical level, you might like that as well.<br />
<br />
Bon voyage.

    This show BARELY squeaks by into a 7 because there art/animation is generally really nice and I find the premise interesting. The character for which the show is named, Vanitas, is unbearable and the story objectives that drive the plot are at times vague, but the world’s lore and beauty keep me engaged. If you can handle a little bit of irritation, I think this show works to entertain most people. <br />
<br />
The best episode I&#039;ve seen so far is episode 6, so if you get to episode 6 and don&#039;t like it, definitely stop, I don&#039;t think Vanitas has more to offer than that.

    I feel that in modern day media, the vampire genre of shows has been beaten to a pulp, so much so that it’s very hard to find a novel and interesting take on the genre. You have the classic Twilight series and other recognizable titles such as Vampire Diaries, Van Hellsing etc. But there’s fairly few universally acclaimed, name recognized vampire shows when it comes to anime. But “The Case Study of Vanitas” had potential to be the first popular, mainstream vampire anime…..or so I thought.<br />
<br />
The story is set in a historical steampunk era of Paris, inhabited by normal people and vampires alike. We follow

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416976">
        the journey of Vanitas, a human in possession of the infamous Book of Vanitas &amp; Noe, a vampire in search of thy said book on command from his master. Their chance meeting leads to them working together, and solving the various conflicts that arises with Charlatan, and vampires in general, in an effort to reach Vanitas’s self-centered goal of “saving” all the vampires.<br />
Pretty neat premise right? Well, unfortunately the premise goes to shit pretty soon, and is tossed aside like a used condom.<br />
The premise in this show has depth, but becomes less and less explored. The more episodes you watch, the more you feel disconnected from the story in general. Vanitas’s goal of saving vampires takes a back seat, as they pull various shenanigans, engage in soft core yaoi, or see Vanitas sexually harass Jeanne for the 50th time. Again, enjoyable to watch these dumb character interactions, but kind of leaves you asking for a more serious situation every once in a while.<br />
 Major events occur throughout the show which gives you a more in depth look at characters past and personalities, but then proceeds to go back to showing the same character tropes of being goofy, hyper/ rather than expressing a change in their persona. You get to meet more characters but the plot feels like it’s halted on one spot, and hasn’t progressed since then. I guess it’ll explore forward in the next season, but for now it’s pretty vague and isolated and feels more fujoshibate than an ostracized vampires quest in saving his corrupted, antagonistic vampire race.<br />
The show gives you an over exposure to its comedic side, with chibi dialogues, James Corden levels of sketches, goofs and shit, Le funny. It’s amusing to see the characters act all dumb and have their personalities clash, but it kind of wastes the whole tension of the show. U forget the nervousness and thrill of seeing Vanitas, a man despised by vampires, try to save the very people whom he’s hated by.<br />
The story is definitely not the shows strong suit. It has a decent premise, just left unexplored and often times feels that shits happening for the sake of happening. Unexplained powers, unneeded comedic effects which gets rid of the tension (to its credit, it’s efficient in swapping between comedic moments and serious tones, but it isn’t able to recover the solemnity of an event after a comedic relief, which results in various conflicts feeling more like a joke). You feel drifting away from the main purpose of the show, and don’t see any silver lining of returning back to its original goal, so you end up tagging along for the rest of the show to see some more brainless amusement.<br />
<br />
Definitely one of the weaker points of the show are the characters, though initially the characters in this show feels lively and eccentric, they start to get annoying the more you watch. Vanitas is a hyperactive, charismatic arrogant asshole. His bizarre, quirky personality makes it hard not to root for him. Noe’s more mature, calculated and is the more reliable and well-grounded member of the duo, basically the oil to Vanitas’s water. Their aims, views and personalities clashing is quite fun to watch at first, until it loses its charm.<br />
The repetitive use of the same character tropes gets kind of boring, and then proceeds to get quite dull the more you watch. None of the characters attempt to come out of their shells or show much development. So in the later parts you just expect a mix of comedy and soft core BL from our two mcs, rather than a really unexpected change in character persona.<br />
Side Characters like Jeanne are introduced in a grand fashion, yet is left underdeveloped. She’s a tsundere whos hot…like really really hot. First reaction to her appearance makes her seem like a badass, overpowering Vanitas, making her the Whis to Vanitas’s Beerus (shit analogy I know don’t @ me). But that slowly changes as we see her take a more submissive role, mostly being there for comedic relief or to be harassed by our favorite vampire boy. We rarely get to see her go all out, no filter, like we did in the first 2 episodes.<br />
The duke’s childish persona shows a bit of the human side in the show, among all the badass vampires. He isn’t really an integral character to the plot, but has had his fair few memorable moments. He is also kind of reserved for mainly comedic effects, but his presence is definitely felt in certain episodes. <br />
Other characters are introduced such as Noe’s childhood GF, red haired vampire daddy who looks like a cocaine addict and his bat shit crazy wife or something. But not much is explained, mostly left unexplored, and pretty forgettable. But given its 12 episodes run time, I can see why properly establishing all the characters are going to be a struggle.<br />
<br />
In the words of the great Keanu Reeves, the art is “simply breathtaking” need I say more?<br />
The only flaw I could think of, is in the animation of the fight scenes. The animations great, don’t get me wrong, but most fight scenes have the bare minimum animations. Due to this most fights last fairly short, or ends up being cut short with forceful romance or chibi jokes. <br />
Meaning we don’t get a whole ton of cool vampire fighting in the show…but ngl Jeanne is too hot like damn, I wouldn’t mind if all fights get interrupted if she’s the one interrupting, jeez.<br />
But honestly, you can easily let this slide from how gorgeous this show looks and feels. It never fails to catch your eye with its bewitching scenes and visual imagery.<br />
<br />
The sound in this show is fantastic. The OST’s are amazing. The opening is not the most memorable or anything but is pretty catchy and fun despite being kinda generic. <br />
The voice acting feels lively, especially Vanitas...I mean its Natsuki Hanae, what more can you expect. VA isn’t really my forte, but I can appreciate the effort the VAs put into their characters. <br />
Soundtracks in the show makes Paris feel more lively and vigorous. The steampunk bustling city, mixed with the subtle, melodic yet eerie soundtracks adds a lot to the whole atmosphere of the show.<br />
The ending song is amazing, weirdly reminds me of Ergo Proxy’s opening just more alive and less depressing sounding. It really compliments the whole olden vampire aesthetics a lot more. I honestly have personal bias for the ending, it’s so magnificent.<br />
<br />
Pretty high score after ripping into the show that much. I honestly can’t say that I didn’t enjoy the show, as a matter of fact it’s really amusing and just a lot of brainless fun. The target audience of this show, is definitely leaning towards the people that enjoy soft core yaoi or fujoshi, which might be a factor to why it didnt appeal to me all that much. What this show lacks in proper storytelling and well developed characters, makes up for it with gorgeous animations, and an absolutely sensational art style, enough to make your own grandma say “dayum, magnefique”. If you’re going into this, searching for a deep story and proper character development of a vampire messiah, you’ll be disappointed. This is a show you watch just for a fun time. Grab a drink, a bit of snacks and just have a good time watching Vanitas and Noe do the most stupid shit. The eccentric characters, the breathtakingly gorgeous world, Jeanne when she blushes, all these factors makes for a pretty entertaining and memorable watch. It’s honestly worth a shot, you’ll end up enjoying it if well driven story isn’t a necessity for you. Pretty enojyable show overall.<br />
<br />
(Also, Natsuki Hanaes voice already gives this show a +1)<br />
<br />
Pssst...Beginner reviewer here yea, so if I’m talking outta my ass then I apologize, don’t start a witch hunt against me or sum. Anyways, Peace!<br />

    This anime piss me off. It have potential. It have a solid basis. But it&#039;s own structure keep destroying it from the inside like a cancer.<br />
<br />
An historical steampunk anime with vampires. Cool, right? Well the characters you meet waste all the tension with stupid Chibi dialogue (I swear, every single conversation have a Chibi &quot;comical&quot; passage).<br />
<br />
Potential personalities clashes between eccentric people wasted in pseudo yaoi moments, powers badly explained and a premise that is immediately toss aside. Characters that goes from the Annoying to the boring. <br />
<br />
Combat sequences that last SECONDS. It doesn&#039;t matter if everything is beautifully animated or the OSTs are gorgeous, when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416487">
        the action part is so small. I&#039;m not saying that it must have ridiculous long fights like in Dragon Ball or One Piece, but they&#039;re always fast as a blink of an eye. <br />
<br />
Just as I said though, the external shell of the anime is awesome: Sound, Animation and the Opening are really, really good as always for Studio Bones. But the inside of the shell is nothing worth to check out.

    Not that the story isn&#039;t good, it&#039;s just that I hate these type of characters with jerk personalities and just plain uncaring but since this is only the first few episodes, hopefully they have  some sort of redeeming quality later on.  <br />
<br />
Usually I wouldn&#039;t write a review until I finish the series or just simply giving my opinion, but it&#039;s giving me bungou stray dogs vibe which I didn&#039;t really enjoy because of their personalities and just the comedic duo of a annoying air head/ jerk and slightly self aware character but at times will still treat others like crap. /:<br />
<br />
This is just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411010">
        my opinion but you never know this could be a really good, I usually enjoy vampire  animes so i&#039;m hoping for it to get better since there isn&#039;t really that many decent one&#039;s in this genre.

       After watching the first episode It looked like an anime combining sexy vampires and paris. When I watched the next episodes, I realized that I was not wrong. We follow the adventure of the main character Vanitas and his friend Noe. Frankly, Vanitas is more like a doctor and they explain it with a bit of humor. ​It is debatable how funny it is, but I was laughing from time to time, so we can look at it more or less as a fun anime.<br />
<br />
    The story is not that good, you should watch it without keeping your expectations

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409857">
        too high. I can say that I really like the sounds of the anime. However, the characters were pretty simple, and most of them seemed like clichés. It is very difficult not to have fun while watching the anime, it is a good series in that respect.<br />

    This is a perfect vampire anime with great music and a lovely version of Paris. I think the characters are one of this anime&#039;s low points because some of the characters are not treated very well by Vanitas. We can not get along very well with some of the characters, which causes a little. It is less noticeable the behaviour of some characters such as Noe. Still, the further the anime goes, the better it gets in the characterization of some characters. Give the anime a chance. It does not mean that you will stop seeing this work. But we come to the story of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416996">
        the anime, which is a good story. In the vampire genre and combining this genre with a bit of comedy that this anime has, I think it is good, and it delivers an excellent effect to you. Of course, the story has very few clichés in a series of sections, but it is generally delicious, and you can enjoy it. In general, if you like the genres of this work, I suggest you see it because it is worth seeing once and you will enjoy it. Well, first of all, one of the best strengths of this anime is that its music. It is stunning, and the piece sits on each of the anime sequences and does something to make you disappear from that sequence. The subsequent discussion is the art and animation of the anime. Which can be said to be quite well made of Bones. Not a masterpiece, but entirely acceptable, and you can enjoy it for what it is.

    Vampires. A fascinating group of creatures generally depicted as merciless monsters across many works of literature of its existence. Their conventional roles in a story are either misunderstood and victimized, or they’re straight-up one-dimensional adversaries--a hurdle for the hero to get through. And The Case Study of Vanitas is no exception--the series follows the conventional flow of writing. <br />
<br />
Set in 19th century Paris, the story follows a vampire and a human doctor that goes around the city to cure the recent phenomenon that corrupts vampires. A phenomenon is known as the “Curse Bearer.” Once the phenomenon corrupts its target, the victim loses all sense of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416994">
        normalcy and goes berserk, killing anyone in its sight. This is where the conflict comes in. In the world of Vanitas, vampires and humans have long ended their disputes. There is a harmonious establishment between humans and vampires. However, that’s not to say that there isn’t any stigma between the two races. As demonstrated on the vampire side, vampires, in general, still despise humans to an extent. As for the reasons, they are unknown. But I suspect it has to do with the history between the two and what humans did to the vampires. <br />
<br />
Seeing the emergence of corrupt vampires in the human realm, the ministry for the vampires was searching for ways to mitigate the situation before it turned to complete chaos and disorder. Thus, long story short: Noe and Vanitas went against the ministry’s cruel method of dealing with corrupt vampires and insisted on their own solutions for the matter, which was to use a special book to purify the corruptions. Through this journey of curing vampires that Noe and Vanitas were tasked with, the reveal of themselves and the people around these two makes a large chunk of the series. The narrative thus far hasn’t conceived anything new. It follows the formula of a duo protagonist in their quest of eliminating chaos and dissipating fomentations. <br />
<br />
The heavy reliance in The Case Study of Vanitas is the character dynamics. Yet, the interaction between Noe and Vanitas, or the protagonists with the supporting casts such as Janne and Dominique, are uninteresting, to say the least. It is shown that there could be more to the characters, that each of them can change one another--the four of them. But that’s barely the focus. We were only being given hints between each episode before it disappears and goes back to lackluster comedy. The poor placement of tone shifts is mainly derived from the cheap comedy, where there’s also dependence on chibi art. Some of the writing and presentation lands, but the comedy is a hindrance for most of the time. The jokes in this show are whatever. We can essentially ignore the humor since it doesn’t add anything valuable to the series. The sole reason for its existence is to provide a tone shift, which, in all honestly, can be done better. But in The Case Study of Vanitas, the transitional scenes are just jarring, which for the majority of the time, ruins the immersion of a particular scene. <br />
<br />
Besides the poorly placed comedy and inadequate casts, I am gravitated by its art and visuals. The beautiful depiction of the realistic colors of a city, characters, and overall atmosphere facilitate narrative in an immersion sense. When watching The Case Study of Vanitas, the show was always able to let viewers be placed in situations. Usually, both the writing of its story, characters, themes, and visuals are needed to immerse the viewers, but Vanitas only really succeeded in visuals for me. <br />
<br />
The Case Study of Vanitas is a solid yet straightforward story. Conventional writing does have its charms and faults since it doesn’t flourish into anything outstanding. Its major appeals, I would say, are the character dynamics and visuals. If this series was to be compared with others of its similar playing field, I believe The Case Study of Vanitas would stand shoulders above them. <br />

    The awkward scene jumps often occurred causing confusion and disagreement throughout the story. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s a translation error or something related to the story itself. It feels too rushed and things haven&#039;t really been explained in any way for the viewer to understand. There is a lack of world construction and at the same time massive information dumps and a backstory that takes me out of the story as I have to go back and look again to understand what just happened.<br />
<br />
I also wish a little more time was spent on characterization because I liked the characters, but I found them underdeveloped

    Usually in your typical Vampire stories, you always see Vampires having a lust for human blood but in this Anime, it isn&#039;t that kind of story at all. It&#039;s very clear that the Author has taken as many risks as she can to avoid using the same old formula or tropesto make her story feel special and I have a huge respect for the new and unique direction she&#039;s taken which she easily makes to my top 5 favorite Authors of all time.<br />
<br />
For some reason, I&#039;m a sucker when it comes to the 19th Century style setting. Usually because of the way their clothing are.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417017">
        It honestly makes me quite intrigued and it makes me imagine that I went right back to the past. At first, it was the synopsis that intrigued me the most to watch the Anime. I was so excited to see Vanitas as an antagonist of the show until when the author subverted my expectations. I thought about it, as the story that states in the synopsis is just a folklore and it to be completely accurate would just make the world building more unbelievable and silly and so I liked the new direction the author has taken and, it also allowed for the characters to perform their own actions rather than being controlled by the plot. That&#039;s what makes this anime quite special.<br />
<br />
Vanitas no Karte is not the kind of anime that you see in a modern shounen. In My hero academia, in just one episode you know it&#039;s the story about Deku becoming the #1 hero, in Black clover, you know it&#039;s a story about Asta becoming the Wizard King so on and so forth. But it&#039;s not the same with Vanitas no Karte. You won&#039;t know what it&#039;s about in the first episode itself but rather, certain new things and world building will be explained as the story progresses. The way they introduced the world of the Vampires was also a job well done. I like how they didn&#039;t introduce it like a grand way. It just....exists like any other normal world. <br />
<br />
Some people say that this show lacks in direction and makes it boring but to me, that&#039;s what makes it so interesting. The lack of direction is what makes me want to ask more questions regarding the show and therefore making it quite unpredictable. The story is done in a subtle way so you have to pay attention to every detail you can as they are important to the world building of the story some way or the other.<br />
<br />
Even if it is more of a plot driven story, the author certainly hasn&#039;t forgotten it&#039;s characters as they are the most important in order for the story to be engaging. Every characters we meet have their own kind of a lovable personality and have their own charm. I really love the dynamic, Vanitas and Noe have. Feels wholesome and doesn&#039;t feel forced as Noe was told by his teacher to assess the book of Vanitas and to see for himself &quot;The true character of Vanitas&quot; so it only makes sense for him to team up.<br />
<br />
I think the main reason why the Duo of Vanitas and Noe stands out so much is because they have constant conflicts with each other unlike other battle shounen where you see the Main character always supporting his friend but Vanitas and Noe ain&#039;t like that. They hold and stick to each of their own ideals and beliefs and that makes them even more interesting and they don&#039;t feel cliched at all.<br />
<br />
I feel like Roland will be an interesting character. I definitely feel like he&#039;s planning something up ahead. He could be an interesting sub-antagonist for Vanitas but I don&#039;t think that&#039;ll happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It really sucks in the department of art style while it is truly a banger when it comes to the Animation Department. Most of the time the anime shows background or landscapes rather than actual character interaction. The characters do interact but sometimes, they don&#039;t even show their faces when they are talking especially in big fight scenes. What Bones don&#039;t realize is that, character interactions while showing their facial expressions is much more important than showing off their beautifully drawn landscapes and backgrounds.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m quite disappointed with Jeanne&#039;s character to be honest. &quot;The Hellfire Witch&quot; sounded something like she&#039;s important but in the end, she just turned out to be another waifu bait who serves no importance to the main story I also don&#039;t think there is a potential to the character development of Jeanne and I really hope the upcoming arcs prove me wrong and the way she blushes so hard literally looks like I&#039;m watching a Hentai. Though, I can see in the last couple of episodes the build up to her character development is definitely happening so I&#039;m looking forward to that.<br />
<br />
Noe&#039;s personality was also poorly done. It&#039;s so unbelievable how he is perfectly fine today when he has experienced so much trauma in his childhood. It would&#039;ve been more interesting if he currently had trauma and Vanitas or Domi or even both (preferably Domi because she knows him better than anyone else) would help him overcome his trauma and not only it would make it more interesting, it would also help to build up the relationship of Domi and Noe. It would&#039;ve been so sweet and also cute.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m also disappointed with the way how the chibi comedy is placed at the most inappropriate of times. I should&#039;ve thought Bones would take this direction since they also did the same with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood taking away for God knows how many special and most important, memorable moments the characters could&#039;ve had but this Anime looked so mature that I never thought they would use it at all. At this point, if the series was titled as Chibi no Karte or Vanitas no Chibi then I wouldn&#039;t have been bothered by the title at all.<br />
<br />
For now, this Anime is like a 7-8/10 as this is just the first season but pretty amazing how this got me intrigued so much in just 12 episodes and I&#039;d recommend it to everyone who are into Vampire themed series. There are some things I&#039;m expecting in the upcoming arcs though<br />
Focus on Luka and Jeanne&#039;s background<br />
Focus on Jeanne&#039;s background, how she turned weak so much<br />
Focus on Jeanne&#039;s character development, really hoping to see that.<br />
It will suck if I don&#039;t see all of them happening in the upcoming arcs but I&#039;m just hoping for the best! I&#039;m looking forward to review the second cour as well.<br />

    Inappropriately placed comic relief that isn&#039;t even funny, characters whose entire personality is based upon a few pet traits, and a fast paced beginning that turns out to be sort of episodic later on, there&#039;s not much I can say about this show in a positive light.<br />
The beginning does not spark joy. You&#039;re given an extremely fast paced pilot episode in which Noe and Vanitas meet and become friends. You could say that this episode is the catalyst for the rest to come. Yet, it&#039;s not that great. I really wonder how people can stomach this show when the relationship between Noe and Vanitas is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417914">
        forced and shallow. Immediately after the first episode, they just become de-facto partners in crime, yet I just wonder: why was their first meeting so rushed? You might as well have already made them know each other if all you were going to do was slap a fight scene and then have them become friends at a conversational level.<br />
There really isn&#039;t much downtime in the first episode. You&#039;re thrown right into the chaos, with little buildup. A person is ill, and then they get attacked and then subsequently cured by Vanitas in an extremely short and unrewarding sort of fashion. There was not much suspense, and the problem got resolved quite easily. Ah yes, but Vanitas and Noe become friends! Wow, look at Noe and his &quot;quirky&quot; personality! He&#039;s slow witted at certain times, and that&#039;s so cute! Haha, pair that with the fiesty and flamboyant Vanitas, and you got the golden duo! <br />
Hell no. The discourse and dialogue that Vanitas and Noe go through is pure cringe and shallow attempts at comedy, especially when they start talking seriously the next frame. Isn&#039;t it super funny when a super serious scene gets deflated because Noe or Vanitas does something stupid like kissing a girl? Haha! LMFAO!!!<br />
I mean, I didn&#039;t drop it just because of the bad beginning and horrible comedy. You can clearly tell the direction the story is going to: semi episodic events about curing cursed vampires. Why rush the beginning when you don&#039;t even have a plot to tell anyways? Beyond that, you got expository info dumps in the form of flash backs no one asked for and you get weak episodic arcs? What&#039;s the point? Clearly, the story wants Noe and Vanitas to carry the story, but when you force a relationship between them in episode one without much thought and then make me watch some flash backs about their backstories, I really can&#039;t say that I care at all about the show. What, if not the characters, carry the episodic arcs? I cannot say that Vanitas going around with his book and curing vampires with little to no problems is an interesting premise by itself. <br />
I guess art is pretty decent, but fight scenes aren&#039;t that great as a lot of things are abstracted away in fights, like how most of the time, it&#039;s just Vanitas using that nicely animated, but of course, repeated book animation and bam, there&#039;s a blue lightning and they&#039;re cured. Backgrounds are nice and realistic, no doubt. But, this sort of art is not going to carry the story. Editing was interesting, but it was just that.<br />

    **NO SPOILERS**<br />
ahhhh alright so from this summer 2021 i got to say the case studies of vanitas is one of the best shows out there! with every episode getting better and better, and beautifully adapted from the manga! the art is amazing and animation!! the voice acting is really good. the plot is great, its mysterious, funny, and all!! the main characters are written quite well. <br />
it&#039;s an enjoyable show not to mention the hot waifus and husbandos ur gonna come across &lt;3<br />
there hasn&#039;t been a better vampire genre anime out there than this! highly recommend this.<br />
i definitely think you&#039;ll be hooked onto this after

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415384">
        the 1st episode and so on. Do read the manga after the anime ends cuz it&#039;s gonna just get better and better :P <br />

    For all the vampire fans out there, I too am a fan of fictional vampire stories. I personally enjoyed this anime, I am starting the manga at the moment, and here is what I have to say after watching the 4 episodes available.<br />
<br />
Btw if you like romance, twilight, tvd, steampunk, academia kind of genres, then I believe that you will enjoy this anime.<br />
<br />
First and foremost, I think this could sit at my top 5 animes of the season, possibly even top 3. I am not a professional critic or anything so I am writing this review purely based on my opinions and mine only.<br />
<br />
*Spoilers may

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410034">
        be included*<br />
<br />
The story begins with our two protagonists, Noe and Vanitas. One human, Vanitas, who possesses a great amount of power, whether this power will be used for the greater good or possibly an underlying evil motive, is still undetermined. Then we have our other protagonist, Noe, a vampire who is in search of the book of Vanitas, and out of luck he comes across the current owner of the book quite instantly. <br />
<br />
The two seem to have a complicated relationship, both hate each other for certain reasons but then they also want to continue accompanying each other for their own personal benefits of course. So far, Vanitas has displayed a very confusing and ambiguous persona, in my opinion, Vanitas has this aural or tonal feel to him that makes him seem illegitimate in some way, meaning he could be hiding a conspicuous motive or he could really just be nothing more than a regular human who has been given god-like power. Regardless, the recent episode was full of chaos and action and it really makes us viewers want to keep watching, eagerly waiting for the next episode to air.  <br />
<br />
Overall, I think this series has plenty of potential, so far it has been solid and my personal highlights of this series are probably, the soundtrack and the setting of the story. The soundtrack is amazing and this is not just the op and ending but the soundtrack throughout the episodes has been great too. And oh my gosh, loving the era the story has been set in, I love the costume designs, atmosphere, and everything about it. The series in my opinion has proven to be one of the better vampire anime series, and with the direction it is going. I hope to see great things from this show and I hope that it continues to provide good quality episodes for the future.
