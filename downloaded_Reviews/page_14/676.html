    A PERECT Gundam Movie<br />
Edit: and also probably the most realistic one<br />
<br />
Now I don’t give out 10/10s very often. The only times I have are with the original Legend of the Galactic Heroes, original Gundam, Attack on Titan Season 3 part 2, and only a few other times.<br />
<br />
I generally rate Gundam series very harshly, for example I have only given a 10/10 to the original Gundam, and even rated Z 9/10. I gave UC a 7/10 and things like NT, 00, SEED something between 5 to 6 out of 10 because although they were sometimes enjoyable, they were disappointing and somewhat boring on some level.<br />
<br />
But I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401874">
        have decided to give Hathaway’s Flash (yes the Japanese title is “Hathaway’s Flash” and not “Hathaway”) a 10/10 for the first time since the original Gundam. (Please note I’m not a boomer who worships the original Gundam just because it’s the original. I’m in my early 20s and I judge all Gundam series pretty objectively according to the standards of their era)<br />

Story:<br />
The story is about a group of anti-government eco-terrorists called “Mafty” who want to purge the bloated Earth Federation government to “force every human into space to save the earth’s environment”. Mafty wants to rid the world of corrupt politicians. Considering the fact that this novel was written 30 years ago, it’s amazing how the topics this work deals with are more relevant than ever. However, what’s great about this anime is how it’s not good vs evil. Mafty is correct in that it wants equality, wants to preserve the earth’s environment for the future of humanity, and wants to purge corrupt brutal government officials, but they are terrorists who bomb hotels with innocent civilians (although they are aware of this and do apologize every so often). So is Mafty evil and the Earth Federation good? No. The Earth Federation is an oppressive bloated regime which does not care about the earth’s environment and allows its own officials and politicians to live on earth while sending the poor back to space. They use brutal man-hunters to kill or forcefully evict those who won’t obey them. Additionally, during the battle of Davao, we see that the federation are far more less caring about the citizens of Davao. They carelessly fire many missiles at Mafty mobile suits, which sets many parts of the city of Davao ablaze. Mafty only bombed the hotels and sure they killed civilians, but it is clearly portrayed that the Feds are far far worst. Neither Mafty nor the Earth Federation are perfect. They are both flawed and both have done good things and bad things. The fact that there is no clear cut villain or hero is what makes this anime so realistic. In Gundam, the Gundam mobile suit ( giant robot ) is the symbol of justice and good and hope. The fact that both factions have Gundam (Mafty has the Xi Gundam and the Feds have the Odysseus Gundam aka Penelope), shows that both sides have their own sense of justice and that neither side is the clear “hero”. Great storytelling. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art is fantastic. Way better than UC or NT which I saw in the theatre a few years ago. This is sunrise at its best. The city of Davao is beautiful and it really feels like the Philippines ( I lived there for 5 years so I can confirm). I generally think this movie is on par with weathering with you and demon slayer in terms of art. This movie transcends Gundam and mech anime. The mobile suits are really clean. CG is used for the Penelope sometimes but it is very clean and I had no problems with it. MAPPA better learn from Sunrise. The characters move around like realistic human actors and not 2D big-eyed anime cartoon characters.<br />
The most beautiful part of the movie was the Battle of Davao. the fight at the middle of the film, not the end. The night battles and destruction of Davao were beautiful. I still can’t forget the Messer landing in the middle of a coconut forest. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Amazing. There is a Disco scene that transfers straight to a war scene and it was amazing. You gotta see it. It’s hard to explain with words. The sound of mobile suits and their weapons was amazing. Far better than NT. This is some of the best sound design I have ever heard in film. In terms of sound, this is up there with GuP das finale part 3. You have got to see this in theatres.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
The protagonist, Hathaway is Greta Thunberg with giant robot weapons to use against corrupt politicians. However Hathaway is less vocal than her and far more calm. Additionally, Hathaway recognizes his ideology is not perfect. We see this when he goes around in the city of Davao and when a taxi driver tells him about how he is disappointed Mafty doesn’t attack man-hunters (who are a more pressing concern to ordinary people than any corrupt minister opt federation big-wig) and how people like him can only think so much about the future as he is preoccupied with the present. Mafty and Hathaway are portrayed as flawed activists who have grand ambitions and are genuinely trying to change the world for the better, but such grand plans are not necessary gonna help ordinary people such as those seen in Davao who just wanna go about their daily lives of fishing in the sea or driving taxis to make a living. If anything Mafty is going to ruin their day to day lives as they are planning to forcefully make all humans relocate to space.<br />
Gigi is just Quess 2.0<br />
Colonel Keins is the opposite of Hathaway. He is a commoner and seems grateful the federation has given him a good life for his service in the Federation military. He tries to hunt down Mafty no matter what, even using torture and hostages. <br />
Neither Hathaway or Keins, neither Mafty or the Feds are completely right. Just like in the real world, there are no clear cut heroes and villains. This is why this movie is great.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall 10/10<br />
This is a perfect Gundam movie<br />
I’m sick of anime and Hollywood movies that try to label a certain faction as evil villains. Hollywood always does this with Someone whether it be Orcs or space aliens invading earth or Germans or terrorists or whatever while they glorify the US or middle earth humans or a super soldier or superhero or whatever. Gundam has been doing this with Zeon or Titans or Gjallarhorn or Ribbons while glorifying the Gundam pilots and earth federation or Gundam meisters or tekkadan or whatever.<br />
I was sick of this toxic trend of good vs evil.<br />
Hathaway’s flash is on par with LotGH on how it refuses to romanticize or glorify one side.<br />
This and the beautiful music and animation and scene composition are why Hathaway’s flash is a perfect Gundam movie<br />
My favorite parts were <br />
1. The battle of Davao<br />
2. The day time scenes of Davao right before the night battle<br />
3. Penelope vs Xi gundam<br />
<br />
Additional edits:<br />
I would like to mention that Hathaway’s Flash gets rid of the occultic supernatural elements in previous UC gundams. The UC series has recently been plagued by supernatural Mary Sue characters and Mary Sue gundams. This movie has none of that. Ever since series such as Zeta and Char’s counterattack, there has been non-stop supernatural elements in the universal century timeline. The chief abuser being Unicorn and Narrative most recently. In Hathaway’s flash there are no Mary Sue characters or mobile suits. It is a gritty war story. Also, although the Xi and Odysseus Gundams are powerful, they do not have bullshit supernatural superpowers like the  Nu Gundam and <br />
Unicorn gundams.Hathaway is not an overpowered Mary Sue Camille or Banagher, and neither are his enemies. I’m glad there is less supernatural Mary Sue bullshit in this movie <br />
<br />
Concerns:<br />
I’m certain part 3 will be even better than this movie because of the source material they are adapting, but I am concerned for part 2 because part 2 does not have a big fight scene. There is no Xi vs Penelope. I hope they improve on the original novels because part 2 is the weakest of the trilogy<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Edit:  “Hathaway is the most scientifically realistic Gundam anime.”<br />
<br />
REALISM: 9.5/10 (for a Gundam Film) <br />
<br />
This movie scores a 9.5/10 in terms of realism in a Gundam anime. <br />
<br />
I believe that this movie is also the most scientifically accurate Gundam movie. In Gundam anime, we have bullshit physics such as mobile suits in space stopping in the middle of space to shoot its guns without decelerating. Bullshit physics is everywhere in sci-fi shows including Gundam. Also, we have massive heavy space ships like the white base or the Ra Cailum being able to enter the earth’s atmosphere and being able to float despite it not having any thrusters on the bottom of the ship to allow it to float (because gravity makes heavy objects fall), or Minovsky Drives (Minovsky Drives were invented just before Hathaway’s Flash so it does not make sense for the White Base and Ra Cailum and other older UC ships to be able to float). Obviously it’s not just Gundam that have committed these crimes and things like the Star Destroyer from Rogue One are also guilty of this kind of bullshit physics. <br />
Well thankfully in this movie, there are no bullshit space battleships entering the earth’s atmosphere and floating. In that sense, this movie is far more accurate than any other Gundam anime UC or other. Hathaway solves many of the problems with science and physics that all Gundam anime have been suffering from by setting the entire story on Earth and none of it in space. (FYI, Mr. Tomino has said that the cylindrical space colony model does not work in real life (he is right), which makes even the original Gundam unrealistic. Luckily no cylindrical sphere colony appears in Hathaway because its not set in space).<br />
<br />
Hathaway’s Flash solves 95% of the science/physics-related problems that the Gundam franchise has had by setting the whole damn story on Earth. The only unrealistic elements about Hathaway are the giant humanoid mobile suits, Minovsky Particle technology(including Minovsky Flight) and the New-type (esper) element. (It is heavy implied Gigi is some sort of esper or New-Type as they are called in Gundam). <br />
<br />
Additionally, since there are no space combat scenes, there is no need to justify the fact that there is sound in space despite there not being any air. Yes I know. The recent justification for Gundam weapon sound effects in space is that “the mobile suit’s camera captured footage from outside of the suit and adds sound effects instantaneously for the pilot”. But come on, we all know that this is just an excuse and besides, it does not explain the exterior shots still having sound effects. Gundam Hathaway’s battles all take place on earth so there is no need for bullshit sound effects in space combat because there aren’t any space combat scenes.<br />
<br />
Also, I was getting tired of shows like 00 and SEED where mobile suits are able to hover in mid air even where there is gravity, and can stop to fire its guns without having large forward thrusters or having to decelerate with them, despite traveling at Mach speed. Gundam Hathaway has a bullshit technology called “Minovsky Flight” but at least they explain it. Also, the fight scenes between Messers and Gustav Karls are realistic air-to-air mobile suit fights because they have no Minovsky flight capabilities and have to fight in free-fall. Unlike bullshit SEED or 00 fights (not shitting on the story or characters of these anime, just shitting on the bullshit physics in these shows)<br />
<br />
Another realistic part of the anime is that there is only 1 mass produced suit per faction. Mafty only has the Messer (although they have 3 variations of it: the F1, F2 and the commander type), while the Federation only has the Gustav Karl (yes they also have the Jegan Hunter-type but that’s only in the anime and they are not combat suits, they are auxiliary suits. They are jegan type A s that are the older models which fought in CCA but are now being replaced by the C and D types so they have been handed to the Hunters.). This is realistic because in real life, there is “economies of scale” which incentivizes militaries to standardize their equipment. Tomino was allowed to do this because there were no toy company heads telling him to add more and more mobile suits to sell toys. Tomino made this novel for himself and this was the only Gundam story that he had complete creative control over. <br />
Of course, I’m guessing they will add more mobile suits in Part 2 to sell Premium Bandai Model kits. They’ll probably add a few Re-Zels or a THE-O or something for the Xi Gundam to fight in part 2 of the anime but oh well, whatever... <br />
<br />
Conclusion: Gundam Hathaway is the most scientifically realistic Gundam anime to date, minus of course the Mobile Suits, New Types and Minovsky particles which are necessary.<br />
<br />
When writing Hathaway’s Flash 30 years ago, for Tomino, this was the one Gundam story where he did not get any bullshit interference from the anime studio higher ups or the toy manufacturers and that this was the one Gundam story where he was truly able to create what he wanted to make, not having to worry about budget, time schedule, making the story draw out longer to take up TV slots, introducing a ridiculous amount of mobile suits to sell more and more toys (hence why there is only 1 mass produced suit per faction in Hathaway) and etc... He never expected this book to get an anime adaptation and never planned to make an adaptation himself. The result is a masterpiece that can rival the original Gundam

    I&#039;m a fan of some of the Gundam franchise, but its works are often hit or miss for me. To me, Gundam is characterized by its complex, but gimmicky plots, and quirky characters. Billed as the first of a three-part series, I came into Hathaway&#039;s Flash expecting it to be an OVA, like typical anime movies without a thematically satisfying close, and a rushed or flawed plot line. I feel that this accurately describes the recent string of movies based on franchises, from Code Geass: Lelouch of the Resurrection to Demon Slayer: Infinity Train.<br />
<br />
However, to my pleasant surprise, Hathaway&#039;s Flash is directed closer to a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402130">
        high budget full feature that brings back the basics of quality storytelling. Except for one character (the girl), every character feels solidly grounded in reality, with nuanced ambitions and insecurities, and Gundam&#039;s characteristic gray morality without the gimmicks. This movie does not rely on genetically modified super humans, Newtypes, or super soldiers trained from an early age. It does not, yet, rely on human experimentation or drugs to improve reflexes. Instead, we are introduced to characters who reasonably react to the situations they&#039;re in, who make mistakes and fear for their imminent threats. The fights, beautifully animated, rely on tactics rather than super human movement and light shows. Even the minor background characters are capable of rooting for one side, but exercise independent judgment and disagree with certain actions. This is something even Legend of the Galactic Heroes failed in, where the nobles and other minor characters often followed a singular hive mind mentality.<br />
<br />
This movie is also the only Gundam work I&#039;ve seen that has an extended action sequence that takes place in a modern urban setting without the citizens having been evacuated to nuclear shelters. It shows how military weapons easily destroy buildings, where ordinary civilians get buried in the rubble or burned by plasma of materials melted by missiles and beams. The whole sequence was exhilarating, more so than any other Gundam that don&#039;t focus on terror, but instead just kills people or children to make a point.<br />
<br />
Moreover, Hathaway&#039;s Flash sets up a thematic &quot;coming of age&quot; between the protagonist and antagonist, in a sort of microcosm of the overall plot. The characters realize something by the end, and that allows the movie to standalone, as well as be a part of something bigger.<br />
<br />
If there&#039;s any flaw, the pacing drags out a bit. There are some introspective moments that could have been arguably skipped for more cohesive action, but the decision to keep them is understandable. Together with the Tron-esque electronic music that beats throughout, the movie perhaps seeks to be a throwback to a more old school 80s vibe, when the work was written. The graphics are a beautifully detailed mix of 2D and noticeable CGI, but artistically well-blended and tasteful, and doesn&#039;t really distract. <br />
<br />
I highly recommend this movie to those with a bit longer attention span, and enjoy nuanced ethics, where we could recognize the flaws of some nationalistic policy and terrorism, and still empathize with why someone might believe in them.

    I watch this movie yesterday and went bed thinking about it, and yes this is a pretty good Gundam movie.<br />
<br />
Art. 9<br />
What can you say about the art or cinematography on a film with this kind of budget on modern times?, they all just look stunning. but art in himself doesn&#039;t make a movie a good movie for that you need a good<br />
<br />
Story (9) and characters. (8)<br />
A story by Tomino Yoshiyuki make just 32 years ago, This story depict a bleak future in where the Earth Federation is more corrupt than ever making life on earth a hell for any one that speak up against the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401835">
        government, but because of this is that Mafty appears a terroris organisation that targets and kill high rank federation officers led by a man named Mafty Navue Erin, and that is the premise of this story, is not like the past gundam storys where 2 major powers clash but that  does make him lest epic. <br />
i don&#039;t want to spoil anything so i dont know what i can say of characters, i just whant to say that they are not perfect, they have small errors (objectively) but they are nor bad at all. <br />
If you have not read the novels and you love a good story this movie is perfect for you. <br />
and what is  a good story without<br />
<br />
Sound and music. 10<br />
Music composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, i believe that when you hear a piece created by sawano you immediately say: That is from shingeki no kyojin or frome Nanatsu no Taizai or frome Gundam Unicorn, etc. what i&#039;m trying to say is that he make music that make you remember that fight or that emotional moment and each piece of music is unique of that show and for this movie he make the same, you will remember that fight, that moment accompanied by that superb pieces, <br />
So yes the music is Superb. <br />
Sound effects (at least in the theater) is amazing, you can feel the clash of those 2 in your bones.<br />
<br />
Before seeing it i was worried that I already know the outcome of the story and could not enjoy it, but i was wrong, this movie his pacing the art the music  make me feel like if have never read it. I was really immersed in the moment and my enjoyment was great.<br />
<br />
So is a overall 9 <br />
It has its mistakes, like everything else, but I don&#039;t really care because when a movie has so much good you can forgive the bad.<br />
<br />
Some good news for western fans the movie will be live on netflix July 1, i just hope is not only NA .

    Hathaway Flash is one of the best movie in 2021. No doubt about it.<br />
<br />
The story is amazing, it is tightly paced so it won&#039;t bore anyone who watched this. There wasn&#039;t any point in the movie where it drags or it was too fast, everything was just naturally paced.<br />
<br />
The characters are interesting to say the least. If Gundam has taught me one thing, it&#039;s that either all females are thots or all males are manwhore. <br />
The main character, Hathaway Noa, is probably one of the best mc in Gundam. He&#039;s a passive character, but he&#039;s also not afraid to be the active character. Just an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402151">
        all-around character which is just interesting to see in Gundam.<br />
Though, the other characters are pretty underdeveloped YET, so I won&#039;t rate the character category higher than this just yet.<br />
<br />
The animation is probably one of the best animation I&#039;ve seen, even comparable to Ufotable and KyoAni. Sasuga Sunrise.<br />
It&#039;s just so crisp and fluid. Sure, it may not be as beautiful as Ufotable and KyoAni&#039;s works, but the sheer amount of fluidity of this movie is enough for me to put the animation category at a perfect score.<br />
<br />
The music is amazing. Sawano really just comes and slap me with his boner-worthy OST. The music themes though aren&#039;t really as good as I hope for. It&#039;s decent, but not really as iconic as other music that Sawano did like Re: I Am, narrative, or Cage.<br />
<br />
Overall, just a solid start for a banger of a movie trilogy. I don&#039;t really need to say something other than to watch this if you&#039;re a fan of Gundam.<br />
(7.8/10)

    In spite of my preconceptions about the film, I&#039;m looking optimistically towards the following films. With good characterizations and a solid setup on differing viewpoints of the world, the directing of the movie seems solid. Minor things in the script were a bit weird if you look at it from a series standpoint, however it&#039;s a relief seeing seemingly good execution and presentation after the release of Gundam NT and Re:Rise. <br />
<br />
Hathaway definitely feels like a feature film. From the visual budget to the names attached. But it&#039;s limited in that capacity to be able to fully adapt the novel. I personally have only read

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402096">
        a couple chapters; so there I cannot make any comments. Individually however, it seems to lay the base down for the following films to expand upon. Viewpoints from each side about the main faction appear and to that point, it&#039;s greatly exposited. Characterization is also developed well, with each showing who they are through what they say and their viewpoints. It&#039;s unfortunate that most of the side characters didn&#039;t have as well of a treatment as the main characters though, when their background might be important. <br />
<br />
It balances on a tightrope of it being a drama and a thriller. Through some scenes you can understand the reality of the situation of mobile suit battles. At the same time, there are moments that glorify it through beautiful  effects that look too similar to fireworks. It seems to present a good contrast of opinions related to Mafty, but at the same time fails to showcase the perspective or the humanity of some of the darker sides of the Federation to the same great lengths. Depending on how the series continues the manhunters may be set to become solidly black against the moral grey of Mafty. What I&#039;d like at that point would some depth to it. <br />
<br />
Visually it&#039;s even better than Narrative in terms of character scenes. Mobile suit battles and it&#039;s CG in general can negatively contrast the art that it&#039;s placed in. Comparatively to Unicorn, the CG looks amateurish.<br />
<br />
With the music, it goes for a modern &quot;atmospheric&quot; vibe half of the time where you&#039;re supposed to let it immerse you into the setting without remarking on it&#039;s individual merit. In some moments I felt that it accomplished that job, however in mobile suit scenes specifically it felt far too epic and didn&#039;t fit the mood. I don&#039;t like Hiroyuki Sawano&#039;s works, so there might be some bias. But this opinion isn&#039;t carried over in some of his other works like Promare. Very good sound design however. <br />
<br />
I enjoyed how there were characters in the movie that felt like they had personality. They didn&#039;t seem to just be puppets controlled by the narrative, although sometimes it leaned too  far into precognition to the point of convenience. How they handled newtypes is way better than previous films like NT and Unicorn; It felt like a return to form in that sense.  Scene progression felt moderately natural, and a character’s insight felt as if it was coming from them instead of a narration to the audience. It did dip too much into being a thriller. And, I think Hathaway&#039;s personality and ideals should be investigated further; Gigi as-well, as a character she seems too much of a Quess clone. Hopefully the director can output the next two movies with a similar level of quality.

    Hathaway&#039;s Flash is meant to be a sequel to Char&#039;s Counterattack, the greatest mecha movie ever made (tied with Ideon&#039;s Be Invoked and End of Evangelion, in my opinion) so one would expect the movie to try and be like CCA.<br />
<br />
Maybe it&#039;s trying. I don&#039;t know. The music sounds very same-y, it lacks the kind of character that CCA&#039;s soundtrack has.<br />
<br />
The character redesigns don&#039;t feel like they belong in the Universal Century. The action - operator gunplay like you&#039;re watching John Wick - also feels out of place.<br />
<br />
The CGI works sometimes but other times, not at all.<br />
<br />
Is this movie BAD? No - it&#039;s leagues above

        Genocidal Organ, the other movie I&#039;ve seen by this director. The dialogue here is usually sparse and enjoyable. You can thank Tomino&#039;s novel for that, though. The overall plot, the way things play out, is interesting.<br />
<br />
But the execution? It feels like Gundam wrapped in 2020 checklists. It wants to be a film, not an anime film - but CCA achieved this all the way back in the day. It didn&#039;t need to sacrifice the expressive nature of anime to accomplish that, though.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m very iffy about this movie. It ends without a conclusion, as they want to make a trilogy. Well, I hope the next two are better.

    *THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW*<br />
<br />
As this franchise settled itself, us Gundam fans have had to come to terms with the fact that Universal Century Timeline anime can more often than not be lackluster in audiovisual presentation, which makes them fail to reach their full potential except for a few cases. Hathaway&#039;s Flash is one of the blessed children that achieved excellence.<br />
<br />
Tomino is a visionary with near unparalelled thematic depth and ambitiously deep concepts, but the actual execution of such ideas properly has often been held back by the plot structure limitations set by Sunrise and Tomino&#039;s own flaws, such as his bad storyboarding and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402293">
        trademark stilted dialogue. Sometimes we get amazing looking and sounding Gundam UC shows like NT but without Tomino&#039;s vision they end up lacking substance and soul sometimes. In contrast, Hathaway&#039;s Flash is based on a Tomino novel but it is also adapted by people who are more competent with regards to direction and structure.<br />
<br />
All of Tomino&#039;s messages and ideas can be evidenced in the bleak and almost dystopian world that Hathaway&#039;s Flash confronts us with, but everything is brought to life in such an expressive way that I couldn&#039;t believe it. The animation, direction, cinematography, pacing and music were absolutely exceptional. Both Sawano and Murase did a fantastic job, and the attention to detail was so good to see. The dialogue is still very much &quot;tominoesque&quot; at moments but it&#039;s definitely not as noticeable and jarring as in other installments. <br />
<br />
All in all I just have no significant complaints, and my only frustration is that we have to wait for the next two movies since this one was baiscally all build up. This is certainly not as great as the legends like Zeta or CCA, but it&#039;s certainly up there with the greats and gives me hope that this franchise can go in a promising new direction.

    I was a little underwhelmed by this one, but that may have been down to an incorrect assumption on my part. I know that there are two more movies coming after this, but I was expecting each to be more self-contained. Instead this isn&#039;t the first story in a trilogy; it&#039;s the first act of one story that will be told across three movies. Consequently, this first chapter doesn&#039;t cover much ground, and the plot feels quite loose and insubstantial as a result, lacking the dramatic heft that you would expect from a theatrical release, and so doesn&#039;t work well on its own. I suspect

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406187">
        my score for the trilogy as a whole might end up being one notch higher than for just this part, once I can see it all in context.<br />
<br />
As for characters, they&#039;re a mixed bag. I hated Hathaway in Char&#039;s Counterattack, but he has grown out of the self-absorbed, whiny adolescent he was then, and become a more sober and contemplative character. Sadly he spends most of the movie tethered to Gigi. She isn&#039;t quite as insufferable as Quess from CCA, but is cut from the same cloth, and is what most dates a story that otherwise holds up well, three decades after Tomino wrote it.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s almost beyond reproach is the audio-visual presentation. Shukou Murase brings quality direction to the table, with the mood of the opening shuttle scene and the chaos of the mid-point city battle being particular highlights. Hiroyuki Sawano turns in another great score, and it&#039;s backed up by some of the most striking sound design I&#039;ve ever heard in an anime. The only flaw is that the muted night-time palette used in the action scenes, combined with the convoluted silhouettes of the mobile suits, makes it hard to tell which side you&#039;re looking at a lot of the time. Maybe it&#039;s an intentional fog-of-war thing, or maybe it&#039;s just Netflix&#039;s shoddy, heavily posterised encode letting down something that was meant to be watched in a darkened cinema. I&#039;ll be interested to see how it looks on blu-ray, assuming Anime Limited can snatch it from Netflix&#039;s clutches at some point.

    This is probably the best Gundam movie ever made at the moment, but that doesn&#039;t really say much as Gundam tends to have a lot of difficulty when it comes to movie outings. CCA nd Narrative were pretty ok, Endless Waltz looks good but doesn&#039;t make much sense story-wise, F91 was rushed to hell and back, and Awakening of the Trailblazer was again, just pretty ok. So taking an unbiased look and viewing this movie as a standalone work or movie in its own right, how is it?<br />
<br />
Again, it&#039;s pretty fricken great!<br />
<br />
To start off with, I think special attention must be paid to the art

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402279">
        and sound design. The art itself just looks wonderful and is really a sight to behold. The colors really pop, the background design is so photorealistic that it looks like you&#039;re actually in Davao, the character designs look like a great update to the older UC style, there are a lot of little touches here and there like the Fed&#039;s uniforms being short sleeved because they&#039;re in a tropical area or the clothing distinction between the common citizens and Earth&#039;s ruling class. All of it&#039;s really top notch stuff. There&#039;s also the sound design, which just sounds fantastic thanks to Sunrise&#039;s 40+ years of mech experience (And earlier work on Unicorn). While the music is of course great, that&#039;s the norm for Gundam, there are again a lot of little touches that make you feel really emersed in the world: Cars honking their horns on the streets, the pulsating sound of the mech&#039;s engines, the sounds of animals in the biopark, the high energy sounds of the beam weapons going off. This aren&#039;t things that the production staff needed to add but they did so anyway and it just makes it feel more alive. <br />
<br />
If you can see this in the theaters you should go just for that. But along with great art and sound design, it also has an interesting story and characters. <br />
<br />
Hathaway Noa imo, has always gotten an unfair amount of hate handed his way when he really hasn&#039;t done anything too different compared to Amuro, Kamille, Judau, etc... Well, if you hated Hathaway due to his appearance in CCA, you don&#039;t have to worry because they&#039;re almost completely different characters now. Hathaway in HF is an adult, he&#039;s smart, calculating, reserved, purposefully understated, but still has a bit of that brash impulsiveness and strong idealism that he had in CCA. <br />
<br />
Then you also have Kenneth and Gigi, who are also interesting and unique new characters. Kenneth himself takes on a bit after Sleggar Law, a high ranking member of the military whose heart&#039;s in the right place, but who also can&#039;t help himself when a pretty lady is nearby (Yet fails at every chance he gets). Gigi otoh, takes on the role of the Gundam magical girl trope, yet unlike most others, actually takes a pretty proactive role in the story, much closer to how Lalah was in 0079. <br />
<br />
The story itself is also good but probably not what a lot of people would expect. <br />
<br />
Much like the 1st novel in the trilogy, this movie is more of a character study of Hathaway that delves into his current personality and mental state. As such, there&#039;s actually very little action (That&#039;s being saved for the next 2 movies), and it&#039;s mostly just talking between said interesting characters and worldbuilding to help you catch up on what&#039;s been happening since CCA and Unicorn. This however isn&#039;t a problem as most of the characters are interesting enough while wandering around an absolutely gorgeous city, that it just makes time feel like it flies by. I&#039;d even say some character interactions were more interesting than the actual action of the movie, which itself was very well done. <br />
<br />
However, I think attention has to be paid to the dialogue. This was originally a novel written by the granddaddy of Gundam himself, Yoshiyuki Tomino, who has certain issues when it comes to writing dialogue. He likes to have characters have random mood swings and emotional outbursts, have random characters out of nowhere scream about how other characters feel, weird thinking out loud moments, etc... (This is something you have to get used to watching older Gundam works) So, being an adaptation, does it also have this issue? Mostly no. I say mostly because a lot of the dialogue has been rewritten to sound more (For lack of a better word), normal, but it still has its moments here and there. (Like Gigi&#039;s outbursts on the plane and in the hotel, one of Hathaway&#039;s comrades in the market, and Hathaway&#039;s random introspection during the final battle, being the most notable bits) However, overall it sounds much more natural and subdued compared to Tomino&#039;s usual writing style. <br />
<br />
Overall, this was a fantastic movie and I thoroughly enjoyed my time with it. If you like darker, more complex, and ideologically grayer war stories, this is definitely a movie you need to check out. And again, if you can see this in theaters, DO IT, you won&#039;t be disappointed.

    My problems with the movies are that girl and the fact that Hathaway would never have been perceived as a “horn dog” in the novel, (which I person I talked to considered Hathaway to be) and that’s what the movie is missing, it has this<br />
 $€xual tension but not enough tension coming from danger and the precarious situation he’s in<br />
<br />
Then the novel had extra unanimated scenes, inner monologues, and scene narration that provided important context and engagement that explained future and current decisions made by Hathaway, the contents of those scenes were not well represented in the movie at all, leading to this over saturation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410566">
        of what seems like and can only really be explained by Hathaway not being very mature, being a horn dog, and falling for a adult/more skilled version of quess and then suddenly and conveniently closing himself off from her only to rinse and repeat few hours later<br />
<br />
Not to mention my peeves with the style, the scene/camera angles, the lighting, the sound design, the scene design, choreography, and timing, that all contributed to my dissatisfaction in the movie, including that the movie is something that can’t really be enjoyed as much if you’re a newbie, and the fact that I had to pause the movie to think about what I heard or what just happened<br />
<br />
(To those who question my rating, I have vowed to never rate something 10/10 unless it’s near absolutely perfect, so my rating is more of a 7/10 not 6/10 in the traditional sense, and yes- I copied and pasted my own comment from YouTube and modified it for this review)

    A solid enough Gundam film, that is, as a work in its own right, hampered by its nature as the first in a trilogy. <br />
<br />
From a production standpoint, there&#039;s little to complain about. The artwork and animation is exactly as sharp and high-quality as you expect from Sunrise. I always particularly like the very specific style of character design that gets used in all modern Universal Century Gundam stories, and this gives plenty of that. And, of course, the mecha designs and animation are top-notch, as should be expected. <br />
<br />
The characters are interesting and are, for the most part, established well enough. Even as someone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406951">
        who hasn&#039;t seen much UC Gundam (though knows the important details and characters, including at least knowing who Bright Noa is), I was able to pick up the details I might have missed quite easily, and settle into the film quite quickly, from that point of view. <br />
<br />
Where I did struggle, a little, was the story. Simply that it didn&#039;t feel like there was much of one. Now, as I said, this is the first film in a trilogy, and part of me feels a little mean making this criticism because of that. But, at the end of the day, I still believe that the films in a trilogy need to be able to stand on their own as well, especially the first part; after all, if the audience don&#039;t find enough story to keep them engaged, what&#039;s going to make them come back for more? It feels that this largely doesn&#039;t. It starts a lot of story, introduces a lot of ideas, sends a lot of characters starting on journeys that I&#039;m sure will be interesting as the rest of the trilogy comes out, but unfortunately doesn&#039;t really have any resolution. It feels more like the first episode in a series than a film series, and as someone who&#039;s very interested in the difference between film and TV, especially in how their storytelling is structured, it did mean that I left this film feeling a little unsatisfied, simply because there wasn&#039;t enough of a story to really cling onto.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I do feel like that&#039;s a slightly mean standard to hold it to. As the first &#039;episode&#039; it was very good, and I&#039;m at least pretty likely to watch the next part whenever it comes out. But I also can&#039;t rate it that highly as a film, because it just didn&#039;t have that much. Enjoyable, yes, but still a little unsatisfying, nice as it always is to see a new Gundam work.

    First, for the cinematography aspect, the Gundam Hathaway anime movie which will become a trilogy feels very inspired by Christopher Nolan&#039;s film in the remaining 1/4 of its duration and for 3/4 of the film it feels like a combination of a Gundam-style James Bond film &amp; something like Hideo Kojima or Ergo Proxy. .<br />
Actually, the problem is that in the story about the relevance of Gigi to the main character, the motivation is not clear, but Gigi Andalucia are a typical trope that is mushrooming in the anime industry, the female trope model &quot;Genki-girl&quot; is a kind of cool girl who usually sticks with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405052">
        the MC.<br />
<br />
Gundam Xi &amp; Penelope&#039;s design is closed because the fight is mostly night operation, although I don&#039;t really like Penelope&#039;s design because it&#039;s a bit impractical and THICC CHONKY is like Chicken.<br />
And what I want to point out is the last Gundam that shows really collateral damage like a Gundam 0080 war film War in Pocket.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s where the strongest aspect of Gundam Hathaway is, collateral damage and film escape art because the tension of civilians is trapped between the Gundam and Zaku Messer battles with beam radiation and Missfire scattered throughout the city.<br />
<br />
Overall Goodluck for Gundam Franchise 🚀🚀🚀 I hope this trilogy can be concluded well later.

    As a lover of Gundam Unicorn, Char&#039;s Origin, and the Universal Century, I had very high expectations for this movie before it came out.  I was so excited to watch it, but was quite disappointed while watching it.<br />
<br />
Now don&#039;t get me wrong, the art was stunning and colorful and the short sections of fight music were catchy, but I still feel it was lacking.  The plot was slow and confusing - it took me most of the movie to determine whether or not Mafty was a Char lookalike (who we never see), an organization, or the main character.  <br />
<br />
The first half of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404774">
        the movie was basically Hathaway being grumpy and complaining about humans destroying the Earth to anybody who would listen. The first big fight scene happened after half of the movie had already passed and it was at night, in the dark.  I could barely see what was happening well enough to make sense of it.  The main character wasn&#039;t even involved in the fight, unless you count running away.  It wasn&#039;t until the very end of the movie, with about 15 minutes left, that Hathaway even fought in the gundam.  The fight ended very quickly and I didn&#039;t really enjoy it.  <br />
<br />
I spent pretty much the whole movie bored and hoping for more.  I really hope the next two Hathaway movies are more exciting.

    Definitely worth the hype for me, I loved every bit of it and Shukou Murase&#039;s direction was just the cherry on top, tho the movie had a lot of talking so I still believe that Tomino himself would&#039;ve nailed it too. One thing I believe to be a clear problem was the lightning during the mobile suit scenes, it was indeed dark (tho not for people with good screens and in cinema).<br />
<br />
As for the animation, it was one of the best I&#039;ve seen in this medium. Gotta give it to Sunrise for mastering the animation of human expressions and emotions which makes the scenes and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404311">
        even small conversations full of life.<br />
And as for the mobile suit actions; there weren&#039;t much to them, like there was no proper Gundam-styled fight that you see in other Gundam titles and most of the screentime was used in building Hathaway&#039;s character and other people around him such as Gigi and Kenneth which was kinda fresh change of pace and enjoyable in itself. I liked the first MS scene, the one with Gigi and Hathaway running around, it felt so realistic with lightning effects and terror&#039;s presence.<br />
<br />
It was just the first of the trilogy, with more to come so defo hyped for them.

    Loved this movie so much. Right up there next to Unicorn in terms of quality and content. As a long time Gundam fan, I&#039;ve actually rewatched this movie more than any other Gundam movie. I just wanted to rewatch all the awesome scenes and catch the little things I missed. Everything from the characters, story, music, sound effects, voice acting, animation is top tier. The voice actors did a stellar job, especially Reina Ueda doing the flirty wildcard girl Gigi. I was really intrigued by Hathaway and Gigi and how their ideals could change the course of the world. Where Gigi is a wildcard that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414967">
        can affect Hathaway&#039;s plans positively or negatively. The movie was good enough make me desperate to learn more about them. <br />
<br />
If you want non-stop mech action, this isn&#039;t for you (go watch Gundam Wing). But if you want some deep intrigue and drama, building up to intense battles, this is perfect. The city battle was so amazing that it should get award - the fear of mobile suits battling in a populated area. UC lately is great with their realism, quality, and attention to detail. I&#039;m glad the sales were incredibly good to show that this movie&#039;s quality paid off. I could tell the staff tried to make this movie as good as they possibly could. 10/10 would watch again and again.

    If you like Gundam, you will probably love this film, and if you love this film, but aren&#039;t yet a Gundam aficionado, it&#039;ll probably be a good idea to go back and work your way through the older series, if you have time. You will likely love what&#039;s back there just as much, if not more. Hathaway&#039;s Flash will give people new to the franchise a taste of what the series is capable of and tends to focus on in terms of characterization and storytelling.<br />
<br />
As a new fan of Gundam who&#039;s been exploring the Universal Century timeline the past few months, this is one of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408854">
        my favorite works in the canon that I&#039;ve seen so far. Chronologically speaking, I&#039;m a little over halfway through Zeta, but I decided to skip ahead to check out this film. I enjoyed it much more than the other more recent UC work I&#039;ve seen, the Origins OVAs, which frequently broke with the canon, went for cartoonish characterization over naturalism, and felt far more superficially Gundam than the heavy political and interpersonal drama in Hathaway&#039;s Flash. I would also like to clarify that it&#039;s not necessary at all to have great familiarity with the UC timeline to watch this film, but anything you know about the world of Gundam will only enhance your appreciation for it. Maybe look up a bit of info about Newtypes. <br />
<br />
Also of note, it&#039;s directed by Shukou Murase of Ergo Proxy and Witch Hunter Robin fame. He&#039;s also directed another political terrorism-focused military drama film in Genocidal Organ, which some may be familiar with, and both he and script writer Yasuyuki Mutou have history with the Gundam franchise. If you look at Mutou&#039;s Animeography on MAL, you&#039;ll see a handful of comments from people thanking him for essentially &quot;saving&quot; the Gundam Build franchise and its Divers spinoff with his work on Gundam Build Divers Re: Rise. I can&#039;t comment on that particular series either way, but that is some high praise. These two manage complexity deftly and bring a certain degree of naturalism and human honesty to their shaping of this novel adaptation.<br />
<br />
In Mobile Suit Gundam: Hathaway&#039;s Flash, there is a decent amount of action, and both the action and the settings, both natural and urban, are beautifully represented. Though I&#039;ve never been there myself, the film&#039;s depiction of a futuristic Davao City in the Philippines has been described as incredibly authentic. At least I recognized the Jollibee mascot whose grin is comically plastered to center screen in one shot. Three major action sequences bookend and bisect the drama. The air raid on Davao that shakes up the early-middle of the film is as spectacular as it is harrowing. As parts of the city burn down and crumble around the characters and onto civilians drenched in the dark of evening, frightening Gigi to her core, Hathaway looks on in a daze at the fireworks display of a mobile suit spraying off sparks as it&#039;s penetrated with a beam sword. <br />
<br />
However, in Hathaway&#039;s Flash, dialogue is treated as the crucial element, as a powerful tool for introducing key characterization, moving the story, and pitting the characters&#039; beliefs and experiences against each other. Dialogue is the mechanism by which people interact, and this story knows that people and interpersonal conflict are at the heart of drama and action. Essentially everything we need to know, and everything the film encourages us to think about, is delivered through dialogues, which are at times quite subtle, but always engrossing. I&#039;ll give a few examples from the early parts of the film, and a few of my interpretations regarding what they suggest about the key characters, without spoiling anything of import.<br />
<br />
The film is centered on a love triangle between Noa Bright&#039;s son and ostensible terrorist Noa Hathaway; the mysterious Gigi Andalucia who seems to have an endless supply of money; and smooth talking, but straight laced Feddie colonel Kenneth Selg. They meet amid a hostage situation that turns violent, staged on an air transport. Yet before they&#039;re forced by the conflict to cooperate to find a way out, they already seem drawn to each other, and Gigi&#039;s physical and social magnetism plays no small factor. This relationship serves a function beyond introducing romantic tension into the plot, though. While these characters may never have sat at a table together by their own will, if guided only on their views on life and politics, their relationships with each other represent the fact that our connections to people in life are unavoidable, and are about more than what we may personally believe and desire in life. Rather, while we may think we know who we are and what we want, our connections end up changing who we are and what we want, often by making us choose between our ideals and the people we&#039;ve become mysteriously connected to. This is the truth that underpins the questions Noa Hathaway starts to have about is role as an important figure in the political terrorist organization Mafty Navue Erin.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that Noa Hathaway occupies this crucial position, there is still a sense that his military upbringing and obsession with his ideals has caused him to lead a sheltered, disconnected life. He doesn&#039;t have much practical experience among regular people, and he&#039;s regularly thrown off or surprised by remarks from other characters that by all accounts are rather pedestrian. One instance is when a cabbie who&#039;s driving him around town explains to him, not knowing who Hathaway really is, mind you, that Mafty&#039;s plans to move all humanity into space are impractical, and their reasons incoherent to a regular cabbie like him who is too busy thinking about making a living and his own affairs to even consider what&#039;s going to happen the day after tomorrow. Meanwhile, Kenneth consistently alerts Hathaway to the fact that Hathaway doesn&#039;t seem to be aware of his own feelings toward Gigi, and certainly isn&#039;t handling them or approaching her like a mature, confident adult despite her obvious interest in him.<br />
<br />
So Noa Hathaway is the naive idealist, the social critic, intent on striving towards realizing his goals for society without stopping to consider if his means will be effective, nor if they&#039;re worth the cost in lives. Kenneth is the surrogate of the Earth Federation, which in this narrative plays the role of the &quot;Master.&quot; He is a sort of father figure, both as a social mentor to Noa Hathaway, and in the sense that he represents social order itself. His primary goal is to break up Mafty and protect innocent lives. <br />
<br />
Gigi is the story&#039;s Hysteric. Her rejection of Kenneth&#039;s advances in the first two minutes of the story tell us (almost) all we need to know about the part she plays. While she may disagree with Mafty&#039;s horrifying violent tactics, and the further violence the group inspires through politically motivated imitators and splinter groups, she, like Hathaway, questions the integrity of the social order the Earth Federation protects. She is additionally turned off by Kenneth&#039;s flat, matter of fact spewing of platitudes about the nature of social reality. He may think he&#039;s speaking from a relatively objective, empirical point of view on human nature, and from an accord with trying to be grounded, practical and realistic, but Gigi finds his beliefs all too &quot;predictable,&quot; so she says. She&#039;s heard everything he&#039;s said before, considered such views and cast them aside for their lack of imagination and hopefulness. She doesn&#039;t reason, but she questions. She questions and probes the dissatisfactory discourse of the Master. She questions and wishes to disrupt the current forms and identities of civilization. Questions are the first step toward a new path forward.<br />
<br />
I think it may be important to grasping the direction of this Hathaway&#039;s Flash trilogy to understand the role of Newtypes in UC Gundam, which is the only timeline, as far as I know, where they exist. You may not know of them or their position in the political environment if this is your first foray into the franchise. Newtypes are thought of as an evolved form of humans. They&#039;re people who develop enhanced senses and instincts by living in space for a prolonged period. However, not everyone who lives in space (commonly called Spacenoids in Gundam) seems to become a Newtypel; and they&#039;re typically, but not always, born in space. One of the major motivating factors for moving humanity into space, which Mafty is trying to force in this story, and which Char tried to do in the past, is to encourage this evolution. The other is to protect Earth from destruction and pollution caused by industry and endlessly raging warfare.<br />
<br />
One indication that this is important is that it&#039;s subtly, but I would argue, STRONGLY implied that Gigi is a Newtype as early as the first scenes of the film. The hallmark of Newtype characterization, which tends to indicate a character is a Newtype before it&#039;s acknowledged verbally in the story, is their ability to sense things that other characters can&#039;t. Gigi&#039;s ability to &quot;see through lies,&quot; the fact that she noticed Hathaway immediately on their flight together and could almost immediately discern who he really is through sheer observation, is just the kind of thing that Newtypes are capable of. I don&#039;t KNOW she&#039;s a Newtype, so it&#039;s not a spoiler, but this is a bit of foreshadowing that other newbies to the franchise might miss out on, and which adds a layer of irony to the conversation between Gigi and Hathaway in which she explains that she&#039;s been taught in school ad nauseum that Newtypes aren&#039;t real. Both as a hysteric interrogating the discourse of society&#039;s master, and as a Newtype, Gigi is the figure that represents new possibilities for humanity. However, while her connection to Hathaway has led him to doubt his methods and his staunch allegiance to his particular, narrow set of ideals, where the questioning will lead, and what proposed solutions may be unearthed, are yet to be seen.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the trio are broken up and have to go back to their respective corners, to play their respective roles. The trains can&#039;t be taken off their tracks once they&#039;re in motion. Yet while they attend to their duties, Giga, Hathaway and Kenneth are inextricably connected from now on, and are bound to have to reconcile their political and personal relationships with one another again and again. All in all, this film lays strong groundwork for a potentially important and memorable installment in the Gundam Universal Century timeline&#039;s anime canon, while offering a sure entry point into the franchise for new fans, with a smart and exciting drama that&#039;s representative of the level of quality and narrative consideration that the series has always stood for.

    10/10 - Not only a great Gundam movie, but a great film in general. Gundam Hathaway does so many things well.<br />
<br />
VISUALS/ANIMATION (9/10) Visually, it is extremely appealing and I thought the animators did very well...including the usage of CGI. I know some people have griped about how dark the movie was, but I didn&#039;t seem to have that issue. There were a few moments that looked mildly awkward, but I did not think those moments detracted from the movie&#039;s quality enough for me to dock points there all too much. There is so much attention to detail throughout the entire movie. Backgrounds look fantastic. Character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407211">
        designs are great. The combat looked phenomenal.<br />
<br />
SOUND (10/10) The sound design in this movie is the best I&#039;ve ever heard in an anime and some of the best I&#039;ve heard in media in general. Such a great job giving everything its own individual sound that really made you feel like you were there. This was probably my favorite aspect of the film.<br />
<br />
MUSIC (10/10) You could slap Sawano on anything and I&#039;d be happy...but Sawano and Gundam are just a match made in heaven. While there&#039;s nothing truly innovative about what he did with Hathaway&#039;s OST, it really blended well with everything and I don&#039;t think I could&#039;ve asked for it to be better.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS (9/10) I really enjoy the characters so far. Hathaway&#039;s character seems very interesting. Side characters all have personalities that are enjoyable. I know some people weren&#039;t all too high on Gigi, but I have a feeling she will be much more than just eye-candy later on. I thought all of the dialogue between characters was really well done...and I typically don&#039;t enjoy a ton of anime dialogue since conversations and reactions always seem to be just a bit odd. Also as previously noted, I really enjoyed all the character designs.<br />
<br />
STORY (9/10) With this being a trilogy and this first movie being a setup for the other two, I don&#039;t want to knock some of the vagueness of the story. I think that for what this movie was supposed to do, it did it very well. Obviously you&#039;ll want knowledge from the predecessors of this, but all in all, things felt very coherent to me and it all made sense.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m really looking forward to the two follow-up movies and have extremely high hopes for Gundam if this is the level of quality we can come to expect. Highly recommend!

This movie was well worth the wait after numerous delays. This is the first in the trilogy of movies based on the novels written by Yoshiyuki Tomino. I love this movie, but I wouldn’t recommend this to people who are new to the Gundam series, or specifically if you’re new to the Universal Century timeline (Original Series). If you really want to watch Hathaway I highly recommend you to watch Char’s Counterattack movie first before going in. You’d get more context of who the characters are and what lead Hathaway down his path. But overall the animation and cinematography in this movie is phenomenal, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406219">
        the characters themselves feel really human. The Mobile Suit battles were AMAZING! My only gripe with the film was the last fight scene between the Xi and Penelope was a little too short. But overall I can’t wait to see what’s next in the other two movies.<br />

    Mobile Suit Gundam: Hathaway&#039;s Flash Review<br />
<br />
<br />
Story (8/10) Very Good<br />
More Specifically (8.50/10) Very Good <br />
<br />
The story for Mobile Suit Gundam: Hathaway in a nutshell quite easy to grasp. And it is presented in a way that if you don&#039;t have prior knowledge of main Universal Century Timeline for Gundam, you could still very quickly grasp what is currently going on. For a story that is to be a three part trilogy I went into this movie knowing that this will be mostly the setup movie and indeed it was. This is definitely the movie to lay all the groundwork and in that regards, firstly I wasn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406103">
        disappointed and secondly for a setup movie the pacing I actually thought was very well done. Nothing to me felt like it inherently could have been taken out (maybe the &quot;caught naked&quot; troupe but even that showcases a side of Hathaway that the viewer is able to see which I will get into him later). Overall as a first part of a trilogy movie this one is a very good start.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Art and Animation (8/10) Very Good<br />
More Specifically (8.75/10) Very Good+ <br />
 <br />
The art style in this movie I was a very big fan of. The later Universal Century adapted series (basically everything that has been animated in UC after Unicorn) have this distinct and sophisticated look to it and I love it. (Makes it feel all the more superior to those damn crusty AUs! I&#039;m just kidding... not really). The certain in-betweens did stand out as a tad sloppy though from a hand drawn standpoint. And at the very end when Hathaway was walking outside, the art style and animation had this very odd cg/cell shaded animated look to it that I wasn&#039;t a fan of, it looked borderline jarring and stood out to me like a sore thumb. And although they don&#039;t look bad, I will never prefer CG mobile suits to hand drawn. Overall though it was very good done. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10) Very Good<br />
<br />
The sound in this movie was very good. Nothing to really to heavily brag about here, the music was also very good and I watched this in Enlglish Dub. Everyone sounded fitting to their role and the voice acting behind every character and scene was very well done.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters (7/10) Good <br />
More Specifically (7.50/10) Good<br />
*Minor Spoilers*<br />
<br />
The characters in Mobile Suit Gundam: Hathaway&#039;s Flash were good enough. <br />
<br />
-Most people that had any knowledge going into this movie I assume were curious to how our main character Hathaway Noa would act. Because this guy is the only returning character in this movie from past entries. In regards to Hathaway Noa and his depiction in this movie he came off are as a very hard to read young fellow. It is revealed very early on that the terrorist known as Mafty is Hathaway himself and for a terrorist that is well known and sounds like he knows what he&#039;s doing, Hathaway comes off as someone to me who is still extremely vague in regards to his decisions in every day life choices and more. It&#039;s complex at best &quot;i guess&quot; and convoluted for him at worst both sides depending on how you look at him in regards to a specific angle isn&#039;t wrong. He&#039;s just a tad too inconsistent to what we&#039;ve heard about Mafty from the world around him. He showcases very early on that in a combat situation he can take out multiple armed  terrorist with ease. So it showcases that he definitely hasn&#039;t been sitting on his hands this entire time since Char&#039;s Counterattack but this uncertainty he showcases when he hears about Mafty from others whether it&#039;s Gigi, Kenneth or even some goofy ass taxi driver makes it seem like he&#039;s not solidified with his stance or resolve in regards to what he wants to actually accomplish. This isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing especially if you know how Hathaway (or Simpaway as some people would call him) acted in Char&#039;s Counterattack, it&#039;s just a character flaw at best that I see he still retains from the person we knew him to be. If there was something that I&#039;d have to question about his character which I hope is explored upon more is his skills in a mobile suit. As far as I&#039;m aware he only was in one once back in Char&#039;s Counterattack and for a very small amount of time, unless of course when he was with his group he was flying around in mobile suits getting better and better but this is all we can assume at this time. So unless I&#039;m missing something (which I hope I am) it&#039;s hard for me to grasped how he was able to outdo another mobile suit pilot (and hell not just any damn mobile suit pilot, an upcoming ace pilot in at this time with a state of the art Gundam superior to his own that he just hopped into a few minutes ago) within such a short period of time. The fight was cool but it was hard for me to let that question go fully unanswered even for this first movie. <br />
<br />
- Kenneth was one of the other characters they spent a decent amount of time on. And he seemed like he is setup to be the intellectual rival for Hathaway. He seemed interesting and his boldness towards Gigi was entertaining. I am not entirely sure how much potential he has moving forward though he could easily hit the back burner by the time the 3rd movie comes around but we&#039;ll see as of right now he seems alright. <br />
<br />
-Gigi was the third character that got the most screen time. I found it very odd how quickly she was able to come to the conclusion that Hathaway was Mafty himself. Sure she explained herself how she came to this conclusion, but it still came off as offputting to me, not sure how I felt about the believability and the execution behind it all. She is probably the character who is the sore thumb in this movie to be honest. She is all over the place and her purpose in the movie felt more so like a &quot;token female character needed&quot; instead of having a more valid reason of existing outside of &quot;this is the girl who&#039;s going to be eye candy and poke at Hathaway&#039;s feelings thus making him think of the time he was Simpaway&quot;. Nonetheless she was still some what of an entertaining character to watch do whatever she do. I just hope she has a more integral role in later movies other than the &quot;good luck charm for Kenneth,&quot; because her goofing around will get old if she&#039;s still doing it by the third movie.  <br />
<br />
-The last character is Lane Aim, he didn&#039;t get too much screen time and we only briefly see him before the climax of the movie. Like I stated in Hathaway&#039;s character portion, I don&#039;t understand how he was so easily out maneuvered while having more experience in his Gundam and also being in a Gundam that from a specs standpoint is considered superior. It honestly just made him feel anti-climatic when it came to his purpose in this story which it looks like it was supposed to be someone who is suppose to be the piloting rival to Hathaway but currently right now he has disappointed me from both a characterization standpoint and a piloting skills standpoint. All that does though is leave a lot of room for growth in both of those sections in the future movies so hopefully that is the case.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8/10) Very Good<br />
More Specifically (8.50/10) Very Good<br />
<br />
I enjoyed my time fairly with this movie, it made me feel like I was back home watching something in the good ole Universal Century (THE BEST UNIVERSE). I enjoyed all the setup and I&#039;m glad that this movie did end off with some good ole Gundam vs Gundam action as well because they easily could have left that out. But from a director standpoint they probably thought it would not be smart to not show some Gundam action of some sort in a Gundam movie of any kind, which I&#039;m glad it made it in even if it was at the very end.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall (8/10) Very Good<br />
More Specifically (8.25/10) Very Good<br />
<br />
Mobile Suit Gundam: Hathaway&#039;s Flash is a very good Gundam movie and a very good start to a trilogy movie. I am glad to say you can indeed hop into this movie without prior knowledge. Even if you have prior knowledge it outside of knowing who Hathaway used to be, who he&#039;s related to and a few flashbacks you aren&#039;t going to feel super rewarded having prior UC knowledge from this film and that&#039;s not necessarily bad if it meant not alienating newcomers. You can tell it was built to be able to understand and hop in which is a smart way to go about it since it did premier on Netflix. I recommend this to anyone interested remotely interested in it.

    An insipid cash grab fluff piece made to sell model kits with no innate moral integrity.<br />
 If you go into this expecting a true follow up to Char&#039;s Counterattack, you&#039;ll find yourself sorely disappointed. The first in a planned trilogy, it stretches the plot of its respective novel paper thin and chews its scenery in a garishly overproduced fashion. Every single plot point of this film is set up in anticipation of its follow ups; it feels like if you took a rolling pin to a flashy 24 minute episode and rolled it out to feature length. <br />
The character art is gorgeous, sometimes excessively so,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406046">
        and the backgrounds as well. However, the mobile suits are all CGI, and a decent amount of the SFX are as well (during the climactic fight, there were some smoke clouds so poorly rendered I couldn&#039;t believe my eyes). It doesn&#039;t help that their designs are overcomplicated and toyetic in the first place, but even though the CGI is well-integrated, it&#039;s still extremely noticeable. Gundam is one of the last franchise bastions of hand-drawn mech and so the opportunistic switch to CGI is a major disappointment.<br />
The sound design is overblown and bombastic, with a score that seems more Hollywood than Gundam. The two insert songs are also not very good, though I have strong opinions on music so your mileage may vary on that count. I&#039;m a fan of insert songs, as well, but they both seemed out of place.<br />
The character writing is standard Tomino flat, a style I normally enjoy, but the rough edges of characters like Gigi and Kenneth feel sanded over. All eroticism is shoveled into one scene and then the character relationships are left to idly wander with no resolution (ostensibly so they can be resolved in the next film- as I stated earlier, I believe stretching the novel into a trilogy was a bad choice and this is a major part of why). Gigi never feels Newtype crazy in that way that girls like Four Murasame or Elpeo Ple do, Kenneth&#039;s stated machismo is a squeaky clean cotton white restricted to one or two off lines and then later mistreatment of a prisoner that cuts off as soon as force is used. Hathaway is presented as a dark and broody hero and all of his moral complication is simply implied rather than directly stated, which makes him feel stale. <br />
I did not enjoy this movie; I found it intellectually dishonest at best. It glorifies war and terrorism in the name of selling branded merch without any consideration- it is effused with a love of the idea of &quot;Gundam&quot; without understanding its own text or what Gundam&#039;s original incarnation is meant to represent.
