    This movie was a lot better than I expected. What I originally thought was a low budget movie with a generic plot was actually a beautiful, enjoyable tale that made me cry. It&#039;s a story about family, about growing up, and being who you are, regardless of what other people may tell you. There is nothing about the story I didn&#039;t like, and the plot seemed full and the movie was brought to a close nicely. The characters, although not really relatable, were lovable, believable  and entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I think you would too!  <br />

    To be honest, this movie is much better than it has any right to be. Looking at it, I really didn&#039;t expect much, but downloaded it anyways because dinosaurs. I was very surprised at how good the fights were, and appreciated and respected the character of the lead. It left me feeling somewhat emotional, and I had this hollow feeling I get when something I enjoy ends. Go for it, I&#039;m sure it would appeal to most.

    Omae Umasou da na is a movie that has dived into a topic that happens in a good amount of dinosaur movies*Coughlandbeforetimecough*. While the movie doesn&#039;t reinvent the wheel, it does tell a interesting story that has you watching till the end.<br />
<br />
Story: The story focuses on a T-rex(Big Jaw as it&#039;s called in the movie) named Heart. At the beginning of the movie an egg drifts down the river, a plant eater(Completely blanking on the species) finds this egg and decides to take it as it&#039;s own along with her own eggs. After a dinosaur attack all that remains of her eggs are just one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35504">
        of her own eggs, and the one with Heart in it. After the eggs hatch the herd tells the mother to abandon the egg due to it being a meat eater, the mother decides to split off from the herd and raise the two children in solitude. In order to control Heart&#039;s meat eating nature the mother has him eat red berries as a substitute. This plan works decently but Heart still has his cravings for meat. While Heart and his brother Light(The other dinosaur that hatched) go out berry hunting, Heart decides to head off in his own direction. Heart then meets a herd of Big Jaws with their leader being a one eyes big jaw named appropriately &quot;One Eyed Baku.&quot; While the herd is taking in their game Heart flees at the sight of them eating the flesh of their catch, Baku then questions him on why he is here and what is he doing. After answering his questions and scurrying off, one of the herd breaks off to track Heart. When Heart returns to Light the herd member (Think his name was Doma. Names were far and between in this movie) attacks Light and questions Heart&#039;s relationship to a plant eater. Doma laughs at the idea of the two being brothers and tempts Heart with the taste of meat and tells him that he is a Big Jaw.(Which Heart denies due to being raised as a plant eater) They scuffle with Heart ripping off Doma&#039;s tail and Heart begins to question his taste of meat and what he really is. That&#039;s part one. I&#039;ll focus on part two briefly so you get a glimpse of why the hell this movie is named what it is.<br />
<br />
A stronger grown up heart (This is probably the only movie where you will see a T-rex doing push-ups with one hand), after breaking off from the herd has taken his taste of meat with pride. Hunting other dinosaurs and eating his flesh, he soon sees a tiny egg on the ground. Heart approaches it to find a baby anklyosaurus(Hard Shell is the term they use) who believes Heart is his father. Heart in his meat phase calls the baby Umasou(Which means something on the lines of delicious) as to which the baby thinks his name is(Reminded me of Chii&#039;s sweet home). Umasou now follows Heart believing that he is his father and wants to become strong like him. I&#039;m gonna leave off there since I&#039;m sure at this point if you&#039;re reading you must have some interest in this movie. I hope that&#039;s the case.<br />
<br />
Art: The art is very colorful. Landscapes are painted to match the areas, my favorite being the vast deserts covered with sands with animal bones being scattered all across, with patches of grass randomly in it. Character designs are well, this is a kid&#039;s movie after all. Basic and plain, but enough to warrant some attention.<br />
<br />
Sound: Music choices fit the scenes accordingly. There are 3 vocal songs that are actually really catchy. The main one being when Heart and Umasou are training(For what dare you ask? Watch the damn movie!). It&#039;s really addicting I swear.<br />
Seiyuu&#039;s are also very good. Was surprised to see Baku being played by Ikari Gendo&#039;s seiyuu(He&#039;s like, every villian now).<br />
<br />
Character: Very good. You get attached to the Heart and the struggle he goes through. Being raised by the complete opposite and ending up raising the complete opposite with Umasou. The other characters like Umasou and Heart help keep the story in check. Was a little bit upset that Umasou did not really do much in the last part, he was just kind of there to say &quot;Hey! Cute mascot here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: The movie is meant for kids, that&#039;s a given. But it does appeal to all crowds. I grew up with these types of movies so seeing another one is fine with me, though for this one the fight scenes are actually pretty cool. The last one with ____ being the best one. I watched it on my own and enjoyed it, I&#039;m also 20 by the way.<br />
<br />
Overall: This movie is the same old telling just brought back with some cool stuff. Characters are fun, the songs are catchy, and in the end you really do feel for Heart and the choices he makes as a character. It&#039;s a movie you can really watch with anyone, and I&#039;d say if you got nothing better to do. Watch Umasou do a breakdance spin with his awkward body.<br />
<br />
8/10

    Omae Wa Umasou Da Na is a beautiful movie that you should watch if you enjoyed The Land Before Time or just enjoy anime in general.<br />
<br />
I watched this movie after a friend recommended it to me saying it was somehow cuter yet darker than The Land Before Time all at once, for the most part I say that is true. I&#039;ll try not to give too much of the story away but be fair warned I do explain some of the plot in this review. <br />
<br />
The movie is the heartfelt tale of a lost egg found in a river by a herbivore dinosaur who hatches

          <span style="display: none;" id="review50181">
        into a baby T-Rex, despite protests from the other tribe members the mother decides to raise him along with her biological son Light, the T-Rex who ends up named &quot;Heart&quot; (voiced by Kappei Yamaguchi) eventually Heart discovers the truth that he is a meat eater and adventures out on his own to eat meat. Heart then discovers an egg and in an attempt to eat him says &quot;Omae wa umasou da na&quot; (You look Delicious/Tasty) The child mistakes him for his father and Umasou for his name. Fortunately the writing doesn&#039;t go too far with pointing on this pun, the joke only really working once when one other dinosaur tries to eat him.<br />
<br />
Also the dialogue in this movie is for the most part, fairly minimal, this movie does something great and shows rather than tells, which seems to be the failing of a lot of anime series or movies with a great concept but over does it with monologuing or unnecessary dialogue. It was nice to just soak up the art of this movie and let the actions speak for the movie, rather than words. Which when they are used, are used to great effect, thanks to a good cast.<br />
<br />
While the characters are fairly standard, they all do a wonderful job at their roles in the story, not doing anything ground breaking but not doing anything that could cause them to be annoying or boring. They all tug at your heart strings at one time or another, or just fill the purpose in the story as antagonists who you love to hate, or feel sorry for.  Light is the perfect older brother, the mother is sweet and caring but conflicted about raising a meat eater and how to deal with the truth of the situation. Heart is rebellious and rough, as expected of a T-Rex raised as on berries who just wants to eat meat. Umasou is adorable and offers Heart a chance to return to his roots and softens the character by the end of the film as well as revealing his true nature.<br />
<br />
The music apart from those with vocals - one in particular about meat eaters which is my favourite - is understated and doesn&#039;t draw attention to itself. It swells in all the right places, fitting the moment but without being overall memorable. The only song that sort of bothered me was the training montage in the middle with it&#039;s gratuitous Engrish. The song about &quot;Big Jaws&quot; or T-Rex is a haunting lullaby used throughout which is rather cute yet haunting at the same time.<br />
<br />
I should mention the performance by Kappei Yamaguchi who sounds almost exactly like Inuyasha in this role. Kappei excels at adding that animalistic sound to characters, the growls, the sniffing, the way of breathing. He just does it so naturally one would have to think he was part animal. He also adds that kindness and youthful rebellious charm. So Heart comes off as strong, tough, harsh but kind, he was basically made for the role. Unfortunately he&#039;s the only name I recognise and the cast list seems incomplete. However everyone&#039;s voices fits their roles and the whole cast gives great to decent performances. Kappei is definitely the star, and rightfully so, he voices the main character despite what the title might have you believe.<br />
<br />
The only issue I really take is Light&#039;s voice changes so much from youth to adulthood I could hardly recognise him and it felt like they suddenly turned him into the noble knight character, with the kind of voice he ends up with. It&#039;s not bad just interesting. I think since he lacks much in character arch one has to wonder what made him grow up to sound and act in such a way, he was a very playful child it seems the loss of heart may of changed him but it was never fully explained in the movie. Though the story really isn&#039;t about him so I can&#039;t fault the movie for that, just something that I found intriguing.<br />
<br />
The animation is beautiful though nothing moves too much, the beauty of this movie is in the colour and aesthetic of the film. The action scenes are interesting, as Heart fights differently to the other dinosaurs, showing that he had to train and learn to fight alone. As a rather rogue T-Rex being raised as a herbivore so he is not really accepted by either group but he makes the best of a bad situation. The art is colourful and the designs of the characters are simple. The backgrounds and scenery like paintings. The bright colours make this a feast for the eyes and give the aesthetic a child-like nature despite the often dark subject matters the the film deals with. <br />
<br />
Some of these issues include death, the sacrifices parents make for their children, fighting for survival and the moral dilemma of eating other living creatures to survive despite what kind of person - or dinosaur in this case - that you want to be. It asks questions about nature versus nurture, and about learning to let go of children, as well as the many strange forms or shapes families can take or come in. It teaches a message of tolerance and that family is who raises and loves you, not whose blood or DNA you share. Well worth a watch for children and adults alike, a fair warning though you may be in tears by the credits.

    What do you get when you cross The Land Before Time with a gritty version of Tarzan? Don&#039;t be fooled by Omae Umasou da na&#039;s art style, this children&#039;s movie is not afraid to deal with the moral implications of life and death. What most impressed me was how surprisingly well-animated the movie was, especially in the impressively well-done shounen-style fight scenes; didn&#039;t see THAT coming did you!<br />
<br />
The characters are loveable and the story is well-written. You really empathize with Tarz... a carnivorous dinosaur raised by gorill... by herbivorous dinosaurs. It&#039;s got that cute Japanese kids movie touch, but this is a genuinely well-done piece

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258016">
        of cinema and you&#039;ll probably become an instant fan.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll disagree with what others have said... this movie has every right to be as awesome as it is. It&#039;s just that you wouldn&#039;t expect it.

    While the art may not be the highest budget or most up-to-date; it is very enjoyable and has a very spunky feel. When you see this art in the future, you would probably make the connection right away because it is so unique. It&#039;s interesting also how the main character dinosaurs look kind of more human-like, round, very cartoonish while the random dinosaurs they show between important scenes look realistic and have feathers.<br />
<br />
Putting that aside, You are Omasou is extremely heartwarming and touching movie. I really enjoyed it. As a grown man, it was difficult not to coo and squeal watching the cute first interactions

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205674">
        between the main characters Heart and Omasou. The entire story meshed together very well and the transitioning of the film was pretty good. It has very funny charmish scenes and I find this entire film adorable and great. I understand a straight guy saying all this sounds pretty dumb and questionable but I suggest you give this film a try. It&#039;s not a masterpiece, I admit, but it&#039;s pretty good and DEFINITELY worth watching at least once. If they made a sequel/spin off show, I would watch it.

    What started out as a simple trip through the internet, ended up at this movie. I went into it thinking I would have a good laugh at some 90&#039;s Japanese animated movie about dinosaurs; and while I wasn&#039;t wrong, the story threw me into a completely new direction with lovable characters, gorgeous art and music, and hilarious but overall well done sound effects. The story itself (although there were a few weird parts that didn&#039;t make much sense) is actually really sweet, and blends together some nice elements about overcoming differences, family, yada yada (but you&#039;ve probably already heard this in other reviews).... <br />
In short

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226268">
        it&#039;s something nice to watch during any event whether it&#039;s a rainy day, you want a good laugh with your friends (or by yourself), can&#039;t figure out what to watch, or you&#039;re just bored. It&#039;s a kid friendly movie, but still carries enough impact to entertain people of all ages.

    Note: First off, I&#039;m sure it doesn&#039;t matter too much but this will be a VERY long review. Also I might spoil a few things for those who have yet to see the movie so beware. Anyway, on with the review!!<br />
<br />
You Are Umasou (aka Omae Umasou Da Na) is a movie that is based off of three books from Tatsuya Miyanishi. To be exact, they are from his Tyrannosaurus book series, which is a children&#039;s series that revolves around a tyrannosaurus and many adventures. I should also note that in each story it is possible that it does not star the same tyrannosaurus from another

          <span style="display: none;" id="review133969">
        book.<br />
<br />
Omae Umasou Da Na is for the most part, based off of three of Tatsuya Miyanish&#039;s books from his Tyrannosaurus series. The order is as followed: His third book, his first book and his second book. Close to the mid-end of the movie, the movie starts to turn more into an original story than completely based off of Tatsuya Miyanishi&#039;s books, because to be honest, his Tyrannosaurus series is mostly aimed for very young children. They don&#039;t have a lot of words in them and for the most part, it is very much a picture book as well.<br />
<br />
That is mostly the basics of what the movie is based off of along with some of the plot. Now I shall move on to the other parts and more of the main plot of the movie. However before I move on to the characters and other parts of the movie, I should point out a few interesting facts about it. But before I do, I shall mention the main characters so nobody gets too confused.<br />
<br />
First there&#039;s Heart, who is the tyrannosaurus (Big Jaw in the movie) that the Maiasaura finds while he is still in his egg. Then there&#039;s the Maiasaura mother who finds Heart and raises him as his own. Then we have Light, who is Heart&#039;s half brother (the Maiasaura Mother&#039;s birth son.) Then we have Umasou who is Heart&#039;s adopted son who Heart raises (spoiler Even though originally he planned on eating him when he got bigger.) There are more characters but i will mention them later<br />
<br />
As I had previously mentioned, the movie is VERY different from any of Tatsuya Miyanishi&#039;s books. Let&#039;s start off with the beginning; Firstly, in the books when the Maiasaura mother finds Heart&#039;s egg, in the movie it was in a river, while in the book his egg was simply on the ground. Another thing I should mention is that in the movie, the Maiasaura mother had a good number of eggs in her nest, but when a herd of Trodon attacked the maiasaura herd they destroyed all but two of her eggs: one of hers and the egg that she saved. In the original book, the Maiasaura mother only had one egg in her nest other than Heart&#039;s egg. In the end though she had two children, but I still felt it had to be added. Next, in the books when the Maiasaura mother finds out that Heart is really a big jaw, she tries to abandon him for being a meat eater. The same thing happens in the movie, but in the movie, the Maiasaura mother tries to abandon Heart because the Maiasaura herd leader wanted to kill Heart while he was still a baby because he was still a meat eater. Even though the Maiasaura mother tells the herd leader that he is just a baby, he retorts back saying that even if he is a baby that when he grows up he could eat all of them.<br />
<br />
Another important detail I should mention is since Omae Umasou Da Na is based off of very simple children&#039;s books, there are many things that are in the movie that are not present in the books. Mainly, there are a good number of characters that only appeared in the movie and not in the books. Some of those characters are Gonza, Baku and Beckon. So there are a good number of changes between the two. One is that in the book, when Heart first meets another big jaw he leads him to maiasaura&#039;s for him to eat with him. In the movie, Heart first encounter with a big jaw is when he watches a group of big jaw kill a three horn (Triceratops.) Horrified from it he tries to run away, but Gonza notices him and when he smells him, he realizes that he smells a lot like a plant eater. Soon Baku confronts him and asks him if he has no parents, being on his own. Heart tells him that he has a mother and brother, but he doesn&#039;t refer to them as Maiasauras. Baku then tells Heart to go back to his family.<br />
<br />
Horrified from the experience, Heart rushes back from his home but almost drowns when he falls into the river. Light managed to save him, but he didn&#039;t realize what Heart had gone through. Soon Gonza appears and threatens Light. When Light tells Heart to run away, Gonza is more confused for a plant eater to care for a meat eater. Light then tells him that Heart is his younger brother. Gonza then explains to him that Heart is really a big jaw like he is. Light tries to deny it and just says that it&#039;s a lie, while Gonza tells him that it&#039;s the truth. Soon Heart yells at him and tells him that he is a plant eater and possibly a maiasaura himself. Gonza forces him onto his brother and tells him that being a big jaw, he can&#039;t resist the taste of meat. Still trying to deny it, Heart bites Gonza&#039;s tail until he bites it right off. Feeling betrayed, Gonza runs away, and Heat still has the tail in his mouth. He eats the tail full and after eating it, he begins to attack Light, only to realize that he loves the taste of meat. Fearing he would attack his family, he runs away from home.<br />
<br />
(Yes I know this is long, but I did say that this is going to be a long review.)<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s a few more differences. In the books when Heart meets Umasou, he had already hatched from his egg and found Heart while wandering. In the movie, Heart finds Umasou&#039;s egg and when he touches it, the egg hatches and Umasou leaves his egg. For the most part after this, the movie is a bit true to the book other than Beckon. But there is one VERY big difference though that happens in the movie and not in the book. (Spoiler Alert) In the book, Heart wants Umasou to leave him because he knows that he can&#039;t guarantee his safety. Sadly Umasou does leave and find a family of hard shells like him and the two of the go their different ways.<br />
<br />
In the movie, things are much different; In the movie Heart wants Umasou to leave him as well for the same reason mentioned above and he tricks him into having a race, saying that if Umasou wins, the two of them would stay together. But Umasou runs into Gonza and his gang who almost kill him. When Heart discovers this, he rushes to his rescue and defeats every member of Gonza&#039;s pack with Umasou in his mouth. When Baku discovers this, he exile&#039;s Heart from the plains and says if he ever returns he will have to face him. Heat agrees silently and leaves the plains. When he gets to a safe area, he makes sure that Umasou is alive, which he is, much to Heart&#039;s relief. Umasou then weakly tells Heart that he wasn&#039;t able to catch up with him and believing that he won the race, asks him if the two of them will stay together. Tearfully, Heart tells him that the two of them will be together forever and Heart truly accepts Umasou as his son. Heart then puts Umasou back in his mouth and the two of them continue to find a new home.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned before this is MUCH different from the original story in the book. If you haven&#039;t guessed by now (Or if you&#039;ve already seen the movie) you&#039;ll notice that the movie takes a big turn from being based off of the books to completely original.<br />
<br />
A few months later, we learn that Heart and Umasou are living on a beach, presumably near the ocean. There they make friends with an Elasmosaurus named Pero Pero. During this scene Heart decides that he wants to return to Egg Mountain where he was raised, after hearing it had been having a lot of volcanic activity.<br />
<br />
Now before I continue on, there are (yet again) more things to mention. First off like I had mentioned the movie is starting to more or less turn into an original story now. This part of the movie is only VERY loosely related to the book. First off, as I had mentioned before the Tyrannosaurus book series doesn&#039;t have the same tyrannosaurus in every book and remember at the end of the first book, Umasou went to live with a family of hard shells. In the second book, there was no hard shell in it whatsoever, unlike the movie. Another thing is that in the book, the elasmosaurus was unnamed. It was just given the name Pero Pero in the movie.<br />
<br />
While eating a meal, Pero Pero asks him if he remembers how the two of them met, saying that she saved Heart when he fell off of a cliff. This is somewhat accurate to the book, where the tyrannosaurus did fall off of a cliff as well, but in the movie, it just says that he fell off of the cliff for no explained reason. In the books, the tyrannosaurus fell off of the cliff because he was chasing some dinosaurs that he wanted to eat and he fell because he didn&#039;t see the cliff. In the movie, Heart doesn&#039;t tell her that he is a meat eater, but she finds out that he is when he  saves her  from a Mosasaur. This is true to the books as well, but in the books Pero Pero was injured by the Mosasaur (however it isn&#039;t mentioned if it&#039;s a big injury or a small one.)<br />
<br />
After this point, the movie goes completely original and does not continue to follow any of Tatsuya Miyanishi&#039;s books. To put it simply, Heart and Umasou begin to return to Egg Mountain, but Baku is informed of this from another big jaw and because Heart is going against his exile, Baku begins to head towards Egg Mountain to confront him. On their way to Egg Mountain Heart and Umasou run into Gonza, who won&#039;t allow them to pass unless Heart kills him. Gonza also discovers through Umasou that Heart is his adopted father and ridicules it. Heart easily kills and defeats him, but before he dies he tries to eat Umasou in one last attempt. He then tells Umasou that Heart isn&#039;t really his father. Umasou tells him that he knows that he isn&#039;t his biological father, but he still accepts Heart as his father. Gonza then apologizes before he dies.<br />
<br />
Heart and Umasou continue to search for his family. He enters the maiasaura nesting ground and calls out for his mother and Light. He finds Light and he asks him where their mother is. He tells him that he believes she is at their old home. When Heart asks why he hasn&#039;t gone to search for him, Light retorts saying that he only now returns after a good number of years. He then tells him that he hasn&#039;t been able to search for her because of his position as a guardian for the herd. Heart then scares the maiasauras out of his way threatening to eat them and continues to search for his mother with Umasou in his mouth. (also Umasou has grown a big bigger as well.)<br />
<br />
Eventually Heart manages to find his mother who is finally relieved to see that Heart is alive and well finding her lost son. Heart discovers that his mother has had three new siblings from another group of eggs and Heart introduces Umasou to his family. Afte the warm reunion, every begins get leave Egg Mountain including Light. But on their way down, he is confronted by Baku, who is mad at him for going against the exile and challenges him. After a long fight, despite his efforts he loses to Baku who almost kills him. His mother begs him to spare his life and she reveals that she is the one who raised him. He asks he what she would do if he was seeking meat, which she replies she would let him eat her. Baku considers the idea nonsense, but says that if he didn&#039;t raise him he would have died a long time ago. So he lets him live and everyone go and tells him to keep getting stronger.<br />
<br />
In the end, the maiasauras decide to leave Egg Mountain for another home. His mom asks him if he would want to join them saying that he could live with them and be a family again. He refuses telling her that is better for them to live with others of their own kind. She agrees and says that it&#039;s probably what he wanted. He disagrees and tells them that since they both live in different worlds they can&#039;t live together but tells him that he was glad that she raised him and that she was his mother. Everyone says their goodbyes and everyone goes their separate ways.<br />
<br />
(Whew that was long)<br />
<br />
To put it simply, Omae Umasou Da Na is a movie with a touch of the first Fullmetal Alchemist and Fruits Basket. How so? I feel it&#039;s related to the first Fullmetal Alchemist because just like it, It&#039;s based off of books (manga for FMA) but in the middle of the story it goes completely to an original story, something that I have always enjoyed in any story. The reason I say that it&#039;s a bit like Fruits Basket is because in my opinion, Omae Umasou Da Na has a lot of potential to it just like Furuba, but it ended on a very bad note (I&#039;m referring to the anime of Furuba, not the manga.)<br />
<br />
To put it bluntly, Omae Umasou Da Na has a lot of potential to it, but right now I don&#039;t see it. The movie ended on a bad note. What it needs is a sequel to it or hell even a anime based off of it. It is a very good movie, but it needs a MUCH better ending to it. For example, they hardly touch anything on the backgrounds of Baku and Beckon even if they ARE original characters. There just wasn&#039;t any real developments with them anywhere. But other than those two things everything else about the movie was wonderful.<br />
<br />
The art in the movie was some of the best I have ever seen well anywhere. The backgrounds and art was truly top notch. 9/10.<br />
<br />
The sound in the movie is just like the art as well. Very nice to listen to and the songs were very enjoyable as well. 9/10.<br />
<br />
But all in all I did enjoy the movie, though it is indeed slightly flawed with the character development with Baku and Beckon. My enjoyment from this is 8/10, my character rating is 7/10, same with my overall vote. Though sadly since it is slightly flawed, I have to give the story of this movie a 6/10, not for not being true to the books (which would have been impossible) but because of the ending of the movie.<br />
<br />
In the end though, I give this a 7/10.

    So I saw a clip of this movie on Youtube and decided to watch it for myself, I can say... I wasn&#039;t disappointed! It&#039;s such a cute movie that it&#039;s hard not to squeal sometimes, it has no reason being so cute. I just love how conflicted Heart feels, as he originally wanted to eat Umasou but that all changed when he gets mistaken for Umasou&#039;s dad. He might actually have a soft spot for the little guy? Who knows! Even he&#039;s questioning why can&#039;t he just eat Umasou already lol, it&#039;s a funny concept for sure. And Umasou is straight up adorable, especially when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399152">
        he&#039;s trying to act all tough. Also the music in this movie is pretty good! I wish there was an OST for some of it, but oh well (I am aware there is an &quot;OST&quot; of it on youtube but it&#039;s unofficial sadly.) But if you like dinos and cute things then this is the movie for you! :D
