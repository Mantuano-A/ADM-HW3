    Watching &quot;ef- a tale of melodies&quot; is not like watching a regular anime, but more like an artistic painting come to life. It really is a unique experience!<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
Taking place after the first installment known as ef- a tale of memories, we now follow the tale of most of the supporting cast from the original I just mentioned. Going into this I was a bit bummed that they didn’t decide to simply go with a whole brand new cast for this, but it actually worked out quite well, as this time around we get to learn more about: Kuze, Mizuki, Yuuko and Yu. (which again

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10653">
        were simply the supporting cast from the first ef series) And get a better understanding as to who they are, and also answer questions that were not answered from the original. You will be transported back and forth from the past to the present, as the overall plot can only be understood by doing so. Now watching this series you won’t really find anything particularly new here with the story, most of the events that take place are more along the lines of what you would see in a Soap Opera---in other words, lots and LOTS of drama here. Basically each of the four cast members will (or eventually) fall for one another, each having to face their own personal demons (just a medifore) in the process. Most of them are not quite what they appear to be at first, and as the story progress you get a much more in depth look as to who they are. The way it is told though, is what really makes &quot;ef- a tale of melodies&quot; stand out. You don’t just simply watch the story and love scenes progress like you would a regular anime. This one is told in a more artistic tone. For example: when the characters are in deep thought from a certain situation, you may see them in a room by themselves--or even see them all chained up as a black silhouette, (this of course represents that the certain character is a prisoner either to themselves, or by another) and a lot of it takes place in the character’s mind and not in the physical form. So you can’t go into this series expecting a &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; idea, because this series doesn’t do it that way. Setting the artistic themes aside for a moment, the situations themselves are pretty standard for a drama, which may turn off some people and give the feeling to them that the whole &quot;medifore&quot; idea is simply there to only cover up a more standard fared story. Which quite honestly isn’t too far from the truth, as many scenes tended to last quite long, and sometimes seemed to give a more slower pace to the storyline. Still, what it lacks in actual new material with its story, it makes up for by the artistic way it shows it. It also has a worth while ending too! <br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
The art of this series is so rich and detailed, I would expect nothing less from the &quot;ef&quot; series, in fact just watching the opening scene with the paper airplane gliding along the sunset sky, is truly appealing for the eyes, as is the entire series. The character design (while nothing particularly new) is well distinct. I especially liked the eyes of the characters. The water effects that come from the ocean will seem to just glide across your screen so fluently. And the character animation and backgrounds are truly superb!<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
I have to say that the sound was the weakest link for me in the anime, the opening and closing were indeed well planned out tracks (both ranging from soft and sincere, to catchy &quot;finger snapping&quot; tunes, &quot; one even sung in English no less) The background music was a bit lack luster though, while you do get nice and appropriate orchestral music that plays in the back during events, nothing ever really stands out too much, with the exception of Kuze’s violin piece. The voice cast was a bit of a &quot;hit and miss&quot; for me too. Most of the deep males voices were nice at complimenting the artistic theme of the anime. But most of the female cast I found to be a bit on the standard side, with the exception of a girl name Yuuko, her’s was well fitting the part. Overall it was a great soundtrack, but it just didn&#039;t seem to be quite as good as the original&#039;s. <br />
<br />
Characters: 9/10<br />
I really liked each and everyone of the characters, nobody ever came off as annoying, or would make you feel that they tossed one in just for the sake of doing so. I was especially captivated with the character &quot;Kuze, &quot; he is a musician with a quite interesting past, and the turmoil he goes through is quite sad--yet exciting at times. The character chemistry was a bit rushed for one of the couples, but seemed to be pulled off appropriately at the end. Since half of this title is all about back story, you get a pretty in depth look into the character’s lives and can really connect with just who they are, and will feel what they feel!<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
ef - a tale of melodies is a truly satisfying experience if you can appreciate it’s approach in things. It&#039;s debatable as to whether this one surpassed the original or not.  It can at least be said however, that this is truly an outstanding sequel! If you prefer a simple and casual romance themed anime then it would probably be best to avoid this one. As many of its extended medifore scenes may tend to drag out and frustrate some viewers. But if you’re an anime fan with a taste for the arts, or perhaps looking for a new way of viewing a romance title, then this series is for you. ef - a tale of melodies is not spectacular in what it shows...but how it shows it!<br />
<br />
Side Note: If you are interested in watching this title, I would recommend watching the prequel first. As some of the original main characters from the first make an appearance here, and the whole overall story can only be understood fully from both sides.

    Tale of Melodies is like watching Leonardo Di Vinci paint a sequel to the Mona Lisa. He&#039;s technical skills has improved, his techniques more refined, but does he have enough soul to mold a creation that matches the sheer brilliance of the original?<br />
<br />
Almost...<br />
<br />
Note: If you have not see the Tale of Memories, do not read this review. It&#039;ll be rather meaningless.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake, Tale of Melodies is definitely not a mediocre sequel. Judged by itself, Melodies would fit the true hallmarks of a classic. Watching episode after episode is akin to surfing upon waves of pure emotion, there will be scenes that are guaranteed to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10669">
        even make terminator a little teary.<br />
<br />
Like its original, Melodies is an utter masterpiece of both visual and melodic artistic direction. The visuals accentuate the emotions in every scene, the speech often feature rhythmic and even poetic undertone; when you watch Melodies, you do not feel like you&#039;re just watching an anime, but rather appreciating an awe-inspiring piece of art.<br />
<br />
Where&#039;s most anime are content to have the animations fluidly and attractively portray an event,  Melodies goes five steps further. Each and everything scene, including even the placement and subtle variations of the OP, are the way the way for some subtle purpose. There&#039;s little else to be said but to experience it. If Clannad for a 10/10 for art, Melodies surely deserves an 11.<br />
<br />
In terms of technical and artistic talent, Melodies arguably surpasses its original. Yuuko&#039;s suffering in Episode 6 for example, ups the ante even in comparison to the famous phone messages of Miyako in season 1. So what keeps Melodies from rivaling memories?<br />
<br />
It&#039;s certainly not the art or the music, nor is it likely the characters. The dialogue and characters remain strong, with a subtle since a humour that&#039;ll be familiar to anyone who enjoyed memories. The story, at outset, looks to have  at least equal potential. On the one side, you have Mizuki, whose must find a way to bestow her love (Kuze) with the will to live and fight against a terminal disease. On the other, you have Yuu, who must save Yuuko from a history of abuse.<br />
<br />
Yet, in watching the entire series, one can&#039;t help but feel something&#039;s missing. In the final episodes, there was just not quite the rush of anxiety one experienced when Chihiro tore out the pages of her diary. Perhaps some of the sudden twists in Melodies was too sudden and lacked the anxious suspense the original; perhaps it was the lack of something to rival the powerful metaphor delivered by the tale of the only girl in the world. The episodes of Melodies, while individually excellent, didn&#039;t appear to quite to weave together as flawlessly as the original.<br />
<br />
Or perhaps it is just inspiration, or soul. <br />
<br />
Just as Leonardo developed better skills after painting the Mona Lisa, SHAFT&#039;s technical capacity only improved after memories. Yet Melodies just has that little bit missing...<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not quite the masterpiece memories was, but remains a brilliant piece of art.

    *Please watch ef: A Tale of Memories first, because there is a continuation of the love stories presented in the prequel. Feel free to read my review for Memories also.*<br />
<br />
After watching Memories, you probably asked yourself these questions:<br />
- Why does Yuuko pop up out of nowhere and disappear before you can blink an eye?<br />
- How do Yuuko and Yuu know each other?<br />
- How do Renji and Chihiro; Hiro and Miyako; and Kyousuke and Kei&#039;s relationships continue?<br />
<br />
ef: A Tale of Melodies will answer all of those questions as it introduces the background of vague characters from Memories: Mizuki, Yuuko, Yuu, Kuze, and Nagi. There is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review118189">
        brilliant connection between those characters and the ones from Memories. Just like in Memories, there&#039;s drama, psychological history in characters, brutal pasts, and everlasting romance resulting from someone refusing to let go of the person they love.<br />
<br />
The anime shows three stories:<br />
- Yuuko and Yuu have one of the most romantic histories in the series, mainly because they knew each other since childhood. They met each other in an orphanage when they were younger. Yuu lost his little sister in an earthquake in Japan, and he rejects Yuuko because of his grievance. Once they meet again in high school, Yuu regrets how he treated Yuuko after he finds out how brutal her life became after she left the orphanage. Determined to protect the woman he loves, he goes through all odds to hold onto her.<br />
<br />
- While visiting her cousin Renji in Australia, Mizuki was introduced to Kuze by Renji&#039;s mom. Mizuki heard a beautiful song played by the violin one day, and Renji&#039;s mom insisted that Mizuki and Kuze spend time together. Mizuki and Kuze spend the next few days together in Kuze&#039;s nearly-empty house. After confessing her love for Kuze, their relationship began to blossom. Shortly, Kuze began pushing Mizuki away to avoid hurting her, even though he loved her, too. Despite Kuze&#039;s medical condition and his rejection, Mizuki is determined to stay by his side no matter what it takes. You should see all of the crazy yet romantic things she does to make him happy.<br />
<br />
- Relationships from Memories continue...<br />
<br />
Art and Sound: The art and sound fit perfectly together. It is more museum-like with the mirrored bodies and masks. As the art is displayed, dramatic music is played simultaneously. Kuze&#039;s violin piece and Yuuko&#039;s improvised lyrics fully explains the moral of the entire series. In order to avoid confusion, the anime presents footnotes at the end of each episode to describe certain terms and references mentioned in the episode. Also, it attaches the time so you can recall where you heard the reference.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
- Yuu is an artist and draws quite often. He never desired to join the Art Club, but he drew amazing landscapes and portraits, especially of Yuuko. His dream is to create a beautiful city filled with kind people, which is why he stayed in Australia.<br />
- Yuuko was Yuu&#039;s lover in the past. She is now the magical advisor that appears before the main characters to bring happiness to them all. With the same dream as Yuu, she is located in Japan.<br />
- Kuze is a famous violinist and Renji&#039;s next-door neighbor. He struggled with a personality disorder ever since he had a heart spasm during a concert. As he awaits for his death, he attempts to end all relationships in an attempt to make it so that he simply disappeared.<br />
- Mizuki is Kei&#039;s close friend and appears off and on in Memories. She&#039;s quite energetic and refuses to shed a tear in front of others. After graduating from Otawa Academy, she moved to Australia to live with Renji (her cousin). There is when she met Kuze.<br />
- Nagi is the elder sister of Hiro, Kei, and Chihiro. She used to crush on Yuu in high school but lost to Yuuko. She later became engaged to Kuze.<br />
<br />
Just as Memories, you&#039;re in for some deep romantic stories.

    &amp;ldquo;Right art tells right people the right things&amp;quot;<br />
<br />
I don&amp;rsquo;t remember exactly in which movie did I hear this phrase, but it has haunted me ever since the first time I heard it. It contains in itself an irrevocable truth about human mind, that tastes are not &amp;quot;universal&amp;quot;, but rather contained in each individual. <br />
Thus some people would manage to enjoy stuff like Rosario to Vampire and Miley Sirius music, while others might rather puke at mere mention of them. <br />
<br />
Where does the difference lie? In the intelligence of the one who enjoys it, perhaps? I doubt it.  If such were the case, it would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11127">
        be reason, not emotions, the one that would makes the difference, and its a well know empirical fact that don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;quot;think&amp;quot; you like something, you just &amp;quot;know&amp;quot;. (It is more probable that intelligent people might be reluctant to be lumped up with &amp;quot;the stupid&amp;quot; and avoid everything that&amp;rsquo;s &amp;quot;main stream&amp;quot; like not long ago the aristocracy rejected that which was done by those not belonging to noble class. )<br />
<br />
I think the difference falls into the capability of the subject to relate it self with the art. Once it become something similar, akin to experience, one can truly understand its meaning and able to get its true message. Think of this: love songs will often sound &amp;quot;shallow&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;stupid&amp;quot; until you fall in for the first time. Then, Oh!  everything make sense. In fact , Too much sense <br />
<br />
When one &amp;quot;gets&amp;quot; what they are talking about, then you can move on to the next phase.   The art cannot only speak of what you have already experienced, but leave you with a new perspective of the situation. It might affect your way of thinking altogether and change you for good. That is right art, one that is not only a passive object, but one that becomes part of the observant and modifies him into something new.  <br />
<br />
With that in mind, I can say with out regrets that Ef- a tale of memories/melodies ( I must consider both, since they actualy belong to the same game)  is not only a piece art, but &amp;quot;right art&amp;quot;.  It tackled to of my favourite topics (God and death) and managed to give me new perspective into those issues, and some little changes in my view of my life as a whole. (it may sound exaggerated and melodramatic, but think how many people had their life changed because of Evangelion. That one did screw up my entire generation, and almost every generation after that one. Compared to that this one is just a mere breeze )  <br />
 <br />
With that in mind, I must lay down a warning. You might find it either a Masterpiece or no more than a cheap soap opera with around 15 minutes of talk and 10 minutes of Songs. It depends on your capacity to relate to the story, which in itself depends on the way you had lived your life so far. It will also depends in the reason you have to watch anime as a whole, or even in your emotional states as you go throught the episodes.<br />
Then, I specially recommend trying it if had ever thought you are fucked up and hated God, if you had loss someone you loved, or if you like pretty drawings and shiny colourful scenes that have nothing to do with the story. If you are not one of those, I could still recommend it if you have nothing else to watch, if only so you can brag about it later and write condescending reviews to mocks those who didnt like it so they can see how cool you are.

    Ef- a Tale of Melodies is somehow an unnecessary sequel. Unnecessary in a way the first season didn&#039;t let any hole for a new season, as I felt it was complete and didn&#039;t need to go on. Even tough, I was still thrilled to watch A Tale of Melodies since its predecessor was absolutely beautiful. Perhaps, it would be as beautiful or as interesting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sadly, I could only dream about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The story is presented in the same pattern as Memories, at this point the viewer shouldn&#039;t be confused in the way it&#039;s made.  While most of the cast are back, they actually switch roll in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22473">
        a sense that the main characters of the first season would become the support cast and vice versa. The most drastic change some can feel while watching Melodies is that is darker than the first season and perhaps darker than someone would Imagine. And here&#039;s the problem, both of the story arcs were dark and yet they both failed to have a sense of suspense. SHAFT was successful in creating a blend of suspense and romance in the first season(Notably the ending of the Hiro-Miyako) and thus the reason why A Tale of Memories was very good. One could think that A Tale of Melodies would be a parallel. Well, Shaft didn&#039;t succeed this time.While the stories had a premise start, As darker these story arcs were, they also felt more cliché, more unbelievable and sadly more boring as it was getting to its end.<br />
<br />
I also have to point that ending didn&#039;t have the same expectation as the first season. While A Tale of Memories felt completed, the ending of a Tale of Melodies is left with the feeling that there&#039;s still something more to tell which can leave an unsatisfying feeling for the viewers.<br />
<br />
Nothing can&#039;t really be said against the art except for some of the characters design that really felt bland or been done before. Truly amazing backgrounds and sunset. The SHAFT art, which consist of high contrast, simple colours, black and white and so on is also magnificent as it played a key role in the most important scenes.<br />
<br />
A Tale of melodies did deliver a great cast, no doubt about that. Yet, the series still suffered from few characters who weren&#039;t developed enough and made them quite uninteresting(Notably Nagi, who even though she&#039;s a supporting character, still had an important role). Another problem that can be regarded is the quality of the dialogues. The series did have some good dialogues, yet a lot of them were predictable, silly and also cliché.<br />
<br />
I have to admit, enjoying the series was quite hard. While I admit Melodies had beautiful moment and memorable SHAFT scenes, it still suffered from long scenes where all it did was turning around the block(Not getting to the point).<br />
<br />
In overall, A Tale of Melodies could have been a great sequel there&#039;s no doubt about that. We hoped for something as good or better, but it isn&#039;t the case. Like I said, it had a premised start and the only element needed was a good execution. This element was never included.<br />
<br />
Beside, most of the fans of first did like this one. I guess I wasn&#039;t in the majority. So go on, flame me.

    &quot;Sequel.&quot; A variety of reactions could be displayed when seeing/hearing this word: &quot;I hope this is as good as/keeps up with/better than the original.&quot; &quot;Will they explain that?&quot; &quot;No, this is enough; anything more will ruin the story.&quot; Some more of this piece of crap?&quot; &quot;Yes, more of this show!&quot; Of course, I had the last sentiment. It is no easy task to follow up on a story. As we all know, if something drags on for too long, it loses its essence, and I believe that usually, beginnings are the best part of anything. Rarely they are not. This is an especially difficult task

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38537">
        with an anime as great as Ef. I can safely say, though, that Ef - A Tale of Melodies lives up to its prequel, Ef - A Tale of Memories.<br />
<br />
The anime is based on an adult visual novel, called Ef - A Fairy Tale of the Two, with original female character design by Nanao Naru, who also did the manga version. The mystery of Himura Yuu and Amamiya Yuuko finally unravels here. Firstly, let me give you a proper synopsis.<br />
<br />
As narrated by the protagonist, Himura, there are two cities called Otowa, one that is built on the burnt rubble of its former self, and another that is a fake mirror of it. Yuu and Shuuichi are talking while the latter is burning his letters, ending his relationships, including one by Nagi, which, though rare of her, he does not read. In the past, a high school boy was walking down the street, when he noticed a girl on a roof. He went to her, and the two talked. It seemed as if she, Amamiya Yuuko, knew who he, Himura Yuu, was, yet, he did not recognize her. She proceeded by saying that she still hated Yuu. At school, Himura saw the words &quot;Art room - Hirono&quot; on his desk, and exclaimed &quot;ano baka (that idiot).&quot; On his way there, to his surprise, he met with his friend, Kuze, who was having a flea market before going abroad. After Shuuichi learned where Yuu was going, he wished him a safe trip (as if he were leaving to a dangerous place). Near the art room, Himura also met with Amamiya Akira-sensei, who thought that Yuu was at last joining the art club, like Amamiya had always wanted him to, but Himura quickly and bluntly dismisses the idea. Holding an unlighted cigarette, Amamiya said that it is horrible how people are always drawn to art, whether it is voluntary or by being dragged thanks to those who are, advising Himura to simply join. After reaching the room, Yuu witnessed Hirono Nagi there, drawing a nude self-portrait with no clothes on. He immediately told her to wear her uniform, thinking that what Amamiya had said might really be true, then she forced him to go shopping with her, much to his dismay. Going home, they noticed a girl, Amamiya Yuuko, following them. A conversation ensued between the three, and ended up with Hirono throwing a sketch book she wanted to give as a present on Himura. Yuu and Yuuko went to the beach, where the former eventually said he remembered the latter. At the present, Hayama Mizuki, who is about to enter college by recommendation, is staying with her cousin, Asou Renji, a former protagonist. After waking up from another bad dream, she realizes that famous violinist, Kuze Shuuichi, is living next door, and insists on meeting him to hear him play nama (live or bare; there is a small joke on that here and a big one in B Gata H Kei). Renji suspiciously tries to prevent her from doing so, but he has no choice, since, unlike Mizuki, he has to study for college examinations. She finally meets Shuuichi, who immediately reminds her of Tsutsumi Kyousuku, another previous protagonist and her senpai, Shindou Kei&#039;s boyfriend; a womanizer. He agrees to play with her. However, Mizuki notices strange things at Shuuichi&#039;s place, but for which he always comes up with an excuse. First of all, his living room contains very little furniture, making Hayama think Kuze is about to move, but he says he just likes big spaces. Second of all, she tells him she wants to hear him play the violin, but he replies he cannot, and after being inquired as to why, he says it is broken. Third of all, a clock alarm rings in the afternoon, and Shuuichi exclaims that it is for his stomach (to eat). Mizuki only finds drinks in the refrigerator, but he informs her he has ice as well. Kuze speaks in a formal manner, which Hayama picks up on, but he explains that he has to talk this way, as he meets a lot of people, likening it to wearing masks, which he has hung up on the wall. Mizuki lightly says that cat masks are kawaii (cute), and asks Shuuichi to lie on the ground with her, just relaxing and enjoying the lack of shoujo manga, which she loves, that takes up space in her room. Later, however, when Hayama leaves, Kuze, alone in a dark room, feels a severe chest pain, and is forced to sit on his couch, saying, &quot;not yet . . .&quot;<br />

A good mystery is answered with more mysteries, as this season does. One of the few down points this series has is a supernatural element that is revealed at the end. Those who finish it will understand. I still like the morals that are taught, though.<br />
<br />
The best way to continue a series is by showing past events, linking them to current ones, which Ef - A Tale of Melodies brilliantly and intricately executes, despite the aforementioned extraordinary happening. Showing the main characters as young kids is informative and gives depth to them. Seeing the lead, Himura Yuu being more carefree and displaying funny facial expressions is refreshing from his current more depressing, somber self. The same thing can be said of the heroine, Amamiya Yuuko, who is now a serious, wise girl, where she was outgoing and always smiling, hiding her true feelings. Hirono Hiro, the prequel&#039;s protagonist&#039;s oneechan (older sister) surprisingly plays a major role now, where she was just mentioned as part of his pseudonym, Shindou Nagi. Their love triangle is similar to Hirono Hiro, Miyamura Miyako, and Shindou Kei&#039;s, where two of them have a friendly relationship, and a girl appears, changing things. Another surprise is that two people have met before any of them could remember, but it happens later, in episode ten, the best and saddest one, although it is in black and white.<br />
<br />
The opening sequence is also played in black and white. Similar to the previous season, the song, portraying the main characters, is in English, except for the final episode, twelve, where it is played in Japanese, which is better, with the same catchy tune. In one episode, the piece is instrumental (referring to the title, I believe) (showing no characters), and, at one time, the ending sequence is a slowed-down version of the opening sequence without the melody; both of which never took place in the prequel. Again, however, like the first season, the ending sequences vary, with some of them dedicated to the heroines. The soundtrack and seiyuu in general are amazing.<br />
 <br />
One of the other reviewers said that he wanted a different cast for this season. What is that about? The entire series revolves around Himura Yuu and Amamiya Yuuko; it would not be right to leave their story hanging, though I would not mind if there were an unrelated (or related) third season, because I could not find another series even close to this one in terms of epicness, but that is highly unlikely, since it is based on a game that has already finished, as mentioned in the Latter Tale&#039;s trailer.<br />
<br />
I could talk on and on about how wonderful this show is, but you will have to see it for yourself. This is romance, drama, and tragedy at their best. The artwork is beautiful and the story is spectacular. I guarantee you will love this anime. It is my all-time favorite one (along with Ef - A Tale of Memories).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You will never see Amamiya Yuuko again.&quot; - Kuze Shuuichi

    ef - a tale of melodies is a deep, unique anime embedded with both strong and subtle themes in a purposeful elegance.<br />
<br />
The second season of the ef series (tale of memories was the first season), a tale of melodies comes full circle. A tale of melodies is an awe-inspiring storyline that can be described as enigmatic, ephemeral, and turbulent, yet leaves an impression that (ironically) is vivid, lasting, and resolute. Little about tale of melodies is immediately straightforward, yet that is what makes the story possess the kind of depth that enables it to project multiple themes.<br />
<br />
While the first season (a tale of memories) confounded

          <span style="display: none;" id="review50717">
        many viewers with its strange representation and plot development, a tale of melodies thrilled using the same strategy. Much of it is attributed towards the familiarity of the intended audience to some of the characters and better continuity associated with brilliant storylines.<br />
<br />
As a warning, I would not recommend watching a tale of melodies before a tale of memories although in my opinion a tale of memories is a much inferior work, as it is important to understand the characters, which a tale of memories did not do as well or project to such a high level of excellence.<br />
<br />
Of the many facets that make a tale of memories amazing is the number of thematic layers it possesses with such an unpredictable plot. The depiction and manipulation of time and space within the anime was played to perfection by allowing viewers to see the anime from multiple perspectives (each with their own unique set of themes) that eventually merge into one. The anime is is devoid of &#039;filler&#039; and each scene has a purpose.<br />
<br />
One of the things I found to very impressive about a tale of melodies was that it was able to preserve the continuity and consistency with story and character despite the entropic pace and developments within the story. Everything that happens possesses a meaning, yet nothing is immediately obvious before it happened. Often the anime has abrupt shifts in themes, yet blend with masterful synergy. Nothing from the anime is what it initially seems, and that is one of the reasons it is so good. In a sense, the creators imposed a set of strong themes towards the viewer without giving anything away, which is rarely seen in animes with similar storylines. <br />
<br />
Along with depth and uniqueness, the broad variety of characters with different personalities, behaviors, beliefs, and even morality added more color and detail to the already intriguing anime. The level of information gained within each character was amazing given the anime&#039;s short length (12 episodes) to develop each of them. Not only were the creators able to do that, but they also developed the characters to such a high level of synergy  that each character was connected to the other characters within a large web that if broken would distort the entire anime. To develop an anime that can sustain such a brilliant plot and strong themes while navigating through such a fragile web is nothing short of masterful.<br />
<br />
However, in the end what makes a tale of memories a masterpiece is its message. It pieces together many facets of life such as distress, egotism, nostalgia, love, sorrow, loss, and hope and knits it into a quilt that provides different messages based on the viewer. Although the message might vary from person to person, it is undeniably profound.<br />
<br />
A tale of melodies is a work of art. It paints a medley of characters in a world that it cannot be detached to and leaves viewers amazed.<br />
<br />

    I often see people making the comparison of this anime to Clannad. But in my opinion, that is a little misleading. Unlike the focus on family with a general tone of warmth. ef is more like finding that dwindling bit of fire in the cold world and live on with an iron will.<br />
<br />
Otowa, the place where the story takes place in, is spelled as 音羽 in kanji. &quot;音&quot; means &quot;sound&quot;, referring to the Suuichi&#039;s violin, and how the music will stop when the bow stop. &quot;羽&quot; refers to the eternal feather of Yukko and the continuation of hope. <br />
<br />
In fact, the theme that carries throughout

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299942">
        both season of ef is the decision of eternal and temporality. Like 13 hours of memory that Chihiro has and Renji&#039;s untiring pursuit of her. Or the conversation between Hiro and Mihako on the telephone. Unlike other shows that ask rhetorical questions and never answer them. ef gives its solution. <br />
<br />
&quot;No matter how much you treasure them, both people and things will die someday. The bonds, the feelings, the memories, the hearts, and their lives. There&#039;s nothing in this world that won&#039;t die. There&#039;s nothing that won&#039;t break. Happiness is nothing more than a fabrication; a false mirage. That&#039;s why... That&#039;s why we should treasure them. So that we can face the farewell that&#039;ll one day visit us without regret. Because it&#039;ll break, it is precious. Let&#039;s make it precious.&quot; <br />
<br />
The anime is also filled with symbolism and clues in its progressively changing op, use of colors, camera transition screens and even the tiles of each episode. (hint: the first letter)<br />
<br />
I guess the reason why I spent this much time writing this &quot;review&quot; is that I don&#039;t think people truly appreciate this anime and how barely anyone mentions it in anime discussions. I guess that&#039;s the fate of being an art piece: not being financially successful and is only enjoyed by the few. Yet, a part of me almost doesn&#039;t want it to be popular. Like that small cafe down the corner of the street. You enjoy its quietness and the coffee and want to share it with more people. Yet that would ruin why you like it in the first place: the peacefulness.

    It is so beautiful, i enjoyed it better than the first season.<br />
The characters are really well-made and have very deep connections with the ones in the first season.<br />
The plot is even better than the first season; the beginning is a bit strange but it just keeps getting better and better.<br />
The music is what i like the most. Every song was perfect in the moment they placed it, they&#039;re also really beautiful and fit the series perfectly.<br />
The art is really something. Not only the abundance of opening versions they made, about 8, but also the landscapes and those romantic moments; the art it&#039;s been worked on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10682">
        a lot.<br />
I really enjoyed this series to the4 point i cried in the last episode. If you like original romantic anime I strongly recommend this. It&#039;s not your typical romantic story, it&#039;s fantastic.

    Spoilers regarding the general feel of endings included - beware!<br />
<br />
ef: A Tale of Melodies, which I will refer to as Melodies in this review, manages to pull out a demanding, parallel past and present, storytelling style which follows two seamingly separate, yet ultimately connected storylines of Yuu and Kuze. Before going into more details I feel obliged to note that Melodies was the first part of the ef series that I have watched, which has in no way made watching the show harder or more confusing - which is a quality of it&#039;s own. <br />
<br />
Story - 8:<br />
The story of Melodies was truly intriguing, yet with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357856">
        ultimately predictable and cliché twists and predictable endings of both storylines. However, the endings were satisfying enough for Melodies to be forgiven for these fallacies.<br />
Of the two endings, Kuze&#039;s one is happy, yet with a degree of uncertainty (which to be fair is countered by the general atmosphere of hope for the future) and Yuu&#039;s is happy but bittersweet and might remind the viewer of the Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#039;s End ending, which features a bittersweet long distance and time limited love relationship.<br />
In general, Melodies resisted the popular trend of sad, melancholic endings and managed to deliver endings which can appeal to the tastes of both sugarhappy and bittersweet ending loving viewers.<br />
<br />
Characters - 9:<br />
The love relationships between Yuu and Yuuko, and Kuze and Mizuki felt rushed and forced at their starts, but if accepted as they are, they are not hard to follow through. Rushed and forced relationships are nothing new in storytelling, but Melodies managed to make it believable enough for them to be acceptable.<br />
Despite the supporting cast being unknown to me due to not watching the original show first, they were introduced well, and more importantly, in a way and amount needed for the sake of Melodies&#039; storytelling, making Melodies work well even as a standalone show. Due to this, it was not untill the very end that I realised that Melodies might be a sequel of another show.<br />
In general, aside from the forced relationships, I have no problems with the cast of Melodies. I must also express my pleasant amazement with the portayal of Kuze&#039;s internal struggles about such a grievous life situation, which stole the show for me.<br />
<br />
Art - 10:<br />
The artstyle in Melodies simply screams &quot;THIS IS STUDIO SHAFT&quot; in Gerrard Butler&#039;s Leonidas style and I must say that it is the main supporting pillar of the show. The similarities of the artstyles of Melodies and the Monogatari series oftentimes made me feel like im watching the latter.<br />
The OPs and EDs were also excellent, especially the OPs which togheter with the soundtrack made me enjoy watching them despite my habit of almost always skipping OPs and EDs. The part of the OPs in which Mizuki jumps and dissipates into feathers is an exeptionaly amazing eyecandy, together with the aformentioned Kuze&#039;s internal struggles as well as the scenes of confrontation with professor Akira Amamiya in his house.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8:<br />
Aside from the song used in the OPs, the soundtrack was generaly nothing amasing nor memorable. It fulfilled its purpose when necessary and added to the general quality of the scenes.<br />
<br />
Enjoyement &amp; Overal - 9:<br />
I am not a big fan of drama and dramatic, complicated love relationships (or any such relatioships for that matter). However, Melodies was not overly dramatic and didn&#039;t reach the point of outright melancholy and masochism even for my low levels of tolerancy. It may have been the general feel of show that kept me watching even whenever drama kicked in.<br />
<br />
To conclude, I watched Melodies in one sitting without ever feeling too tired by the pacing or being annoyed by the predictable twists and not completely sugar happy endings, despite sugar happy endings being the ones I prefer and enjoy - when they are done right. It is a heartwarming show, which I would recommend to anyone who is at least a bit into love hurdles and drama, those who enjoy art and in general to anyone who managed to get to the end of this review without saying &quot;nope, not watching&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading,<br />

    In my mind, the Ef series defined what great animation was in its time; and the animation style paved the way for some of the techniques that Shaft is now famous for. It is a great relationship show with actual meanings, something that many shows these days seem to lack. Thus without further ado, let us proceed with the review.<br />
<br />
Ef- A Tale of Melodies is more of a continuation than a sequel to A Tale of Memories. It tells the tale of the older generation (Kuze, Yuko, and Himura) that seemed to show up randomly but at key moments in the first series to give

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202773">
        the young couples words of advice. This series greatly deepens the meaning of the relationships in Memories and puts the whole &quot;two cities&quot; and other ideas in perspective. The story very nicely generalizes to the main story behind Himura-Yuuko and Kuze-Mizuki while still maintaining cameo appearances by the cast in the original Memories.<br />
<br />
This series, unlike many other recent watches, attempts to carry a message to the viewer rather than just serving as a means of entertainment. On the note of entertainment, this series is very dark; I would not recommend this series for those under 14. However, the entire point behind the combined series (Memories and Melodies) is the theme of perseverance and hope.<br />
<br />
Melodies did an outstanding job of uniting the stories of both series as well as bringing a satisfying sense of completion to the franchise. The ending is very well planned and executed (a sharp contrast with DCIISS) and left me very impressed. I had high expectations for this series after Memories and it did not disappoint.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
The animation quality is very high, making use of many colors giving the series a feeling of warmth or coldness when appropriate. Characters are well drawn and emotions are very apparent at times, basically expect what you saw from Melodies.<br />
<br />
There are many stylistic points that are unique to the Ef series (Minori really) including halos around characters in dark environments and simple yet potent artistic animation sequences.<br />
<br />
Many may disagree with me on the animation score due to the fact that many of the animation sequences seem cheap, such as the characters being drawn in monochrome or other easily-animated &quot;short-cuts&quot;. However, I feel that this is an artistic decision and successfully contributes to the underlying theme of incompleteness. If you pay attention to the OPs/EDs (as in Memories), the final episode is different as now the story is complete and the characters have now been fully exposed (and thus no longer opaque!).<br />
<br />
As I believe the animation decisions were key to the presentation and feel of the series, I felt the drawing style complemented the story and themes perfectly. As close to a masterpiece as I had seen at the time.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The OP is done by ELISA just as in Melodies. Though the song is not as vibrant as in the previous series, it still has the same general feel to it. It is in somewhat broken English but those watching this are probably already used to it from Melodies. There are multiple EDs as in Memories and those are fair in quality, comparable to Melodies. The BGM is very reminiscent of the first series. It carries a calm yet not quite friendly feel and compliments the atmosphere created by the artistic style and animation. There is a repeated theme that is played throughout the series. It starts as a fragment of a memory and develops slowly into a complete song by the end of the series, again a great execution decision that adds to the climax.<br />
<br />
The VA cast is the same as in Memories though the main VAs have shifted. Those that had a supporting role in Memories are now the main VAs. Yuko has a particularly difficult role and the VA did an awesome job. If I had anything against the series it would be Himura&#039;s voice. He doesn&#039;t seem to have the enthusiasm that most of the other characters show, even more so given his character portrayal.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Yu Himura, Yuko Amamiya, Kuze, and Mizuki were all supporting character in Memories. Now they take center stage as their past and present are told in an intricate tale that also links to relationships in the original Melodies series.<br />
<br />
As in the original story, the story takes place in two cities, one in Japan and one in Australia. The two mirror cities is a theme that will be exploited greatly and finally explained in completion by the end of the series.<br />
<br />
The two main stories are the history of Yu Himura and Yuko Amamiya and the present development between Kuze and Mizuki. Both stories are told concurrently in a similar fashion to Melodies, the difference being that Yuko&#039;s story is in the past. There aren&#039;t episodic cliffhangers, as the entire series as a whole is a cliffhanger in that each episode serves as a teaser to whet the viewer&#039;s appetite. Many of the characters have had a very dark past and/or present and these are explained in excruciating detail, giving the viewer a sense of the character&#039;s pain. As mentioned previously, some of these are quite graphic and may not be appropriate for younger audiences. However, the series then puts everything into perspective and finally leaves the watcher with a very philosophical and hopeful message at the end. The conclusion explains many of the happenings in both Memories and Melodies and gives a very satisfying sense of conclusion.<br />
<br />
Overall, the stories are intricate and well planned. Expect some surprises along the way that deepen the meaning of both series.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
The development of the main characters takes the majority of the series as the viewer listens in to the character thoughts. It is very difficult to say much here without spoiling parts of the story but suffice to say all the characters have had significant difficulties in their past that they are trying to overcome. The exposition of each character is wonderful (yet painful) and the main characters from the previous series also return to explain how their roles are actually related to the main stories in the present.<br />
<br />
Value:<br />
Melodies is a wonderful, yet painful, experience that explains many of the confusing aspects that were in Memories. It is show full of details and buried themes that the philosophical-minded viewer will enjoy. As many of the subtle points are buried behind animation sequences and hints, a re-watch will definitely reward the viewer. This series truly breathes life into a genre that I hadn&#039;t watched in a while. And it still resonates years after its release. Pick this up if you&#039;ve watched Memories and liked the artistic qualities and get ready for quite an adventure.

    This is probably one of the most beautiful, yet complex anime that I have ever laid my eyes upon. Every little single details in this anime are continually emphasized to draw in the viewer closer and closer. I am almost at lost of words right now. The way they portrayed everything was too beautiful and surreal that it is almost unexpressable. <br />
<br />
I absoulutely loved how closely season 1 and 2 are incorporated. Every character from season 1 and 2 were carefully intertwined with one and another, giving the show a wonderful feel to it. <br />
<br />
The opening from both seasons were awesome and sung in english

          <span style="display: none;" id="review18293">
        too, which is something that doesn&#039;t happen very often. There was even an episode that had both of the openings played and thus added in a lively tone for the episode. <br />
<br />
This anime was certainlly a masterpiece. Each and every little love story were strokes of success for this anime. Ef, was certainly a refreshing one and is something that will stand out for many years to come. It has truly inspired me as a person to persue my passions and have also encouraged me to face the long road of happiness ahead. I hope that every single viewer out there can take a little piece of this anime and keep it for the rest of their lives. Then maybe one day, there will be a town full of happiness.

Future?  A unknown phenomenon that occurs after the present moment. You’ll never know what might be in store for you so the only thing you must do is gather your courage and determination and march forward!!<br />
 <br />
If you have watch the prequel of this story then you will not be disappointed however have you ever wonder who was the girl with the blue hair was. She always appears when the main characters are in a slump, troubled on what to do next. Exactly who and what is she? a deity? a ghost? She appears and then disappears without a trace. Also who was Himura,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review53473">
        he seemed to know a lot of the answers regarding life but is it from personal experience? He was waiting for someone and in the end the first series, he was waiting for Yuko, the girl with blue hair but who is she and what exactly is their relationship? Well you are about to find out in this sequel to E.F: A Tales of Melodies!! If you like the first series with the crazy philosophical sense in the artwork and in the setting then you w]on’t be let down. This time it isn’t just full of drama.. it has action too.<br />
This time this story is focus on the characters that were giving guidance (Himura, Yuko and Kuze) to the protagonists of the first series. We get to look into the proof behind those words that help the young protagonist out, starting with the view the relationship that Himura had while he was in high school. After all Himura is the protagonist of the story and present Kuze. That’s right instead of 3 male lead, its 2! <br />
	This series rather than focusing on the emotional dilemmas and love ties like “A tales of Memories” this series does indeed has those trait incorporated but it takes them to a whole another level. This one incorporates the themes from the prequel plus the addition of torture and suffering of losing someone. The only difference is whether one wants to enjoy ever last moment they have or try to forget them before they get to deep. The protagonist is rather considerate to others yet very cruel to himself. He would rather suffer and die alone without bothering anyone or hurting anyone too deeply. In one view point he is very courageous but in another viewpoint he is very conceited. Though it is a really painful decision to make and not anyone could have this determination to break all ties. <br />
The other protagonist however is face with a more traumatizing dilemma. Everyone has a scar that can never heal after losing a loved one in an accident, but everyone has their own way of recovering over it. In Himura’s scenario, it’s rather intense. He encounters his childhood friend who got adopted before him and learned something horrifying about her. Nobody could be more prepared to suddenly lose a loved one. No can cope with the facts right away. Wounds take time to heal especially the one in the heart, but this scenario is insane. “When one thinks of another’s feeling and blame oneself, it actually makes the other suffer more. But when the one inflicting the pain is the one who felt the most pain. When one loses a loved one, one could recover by the comfort and support from family or friend but what if that family or friend is the one you lost and there’s no one else who could help you? This person found a replacement for their loved one. Instead of showering them with emotion of the one they lost, they inflict pain on the innocent. However there is a twist!!... <br />
As the plot deepens, the story gets more realistic in the way where we could somewhat apply in our own lives. This story shows us a grander psychological angle. However the similarity between both characters is that they are both running away from reality. They seem to be thinking they are doing the right thing but that is only for self-satisfaction. They are insecure and thinking it’s the right thing to do. However they are scared to face the truth!<br />
<br />
As always the artwork is fantastic as well, the symbols of the scenery really capture the mood and setting. Plus the variety of colors really describe the mood of the characters and sort of sending out a subliminal message on how the viewers should feel. The characters are drawn in the same way as the first series, and the character get drawn in a different frame all locked up to inscribe to us how they are feeling inside. Showing us this abstract scene really get oneself engross on the character. This part I don’t despise but sometime I feel frighten on how the story unravel. However that is this anime’s hook!<br />
<br />
This anime is truly a beautiful piece of work. It is magnificent, how the story is laid out the way it is. I especially like how it has more than one male lead in these romance stories because that way the story does end and not leave the viewer hanging and also for other people to not loathe the author for not matching up the character with the one they chose. <br />
<br />
Honestly to sum up this series, I’ll end with a quote!<br />
This is a story of “Will.” “People who walk toward the future will eventually reach the place that they once dreamt of. Toward the tomorrow that gleam of light”<br />
<br />
I highly recommend this anime to those fanatics out there who really loves a good romantic, sad and tragic anime. You will really enjoy this and will be engross with it. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have. <br />

Can you hear it? The Melody of Truth<br />

    Ef - a tale of melodies. Can you hear that? The melody of truth.<br />
<br />
1. ARTISTRY: 10/10<br />
&quot;Artistry is the quality that appeals to one&#039;s sense of beauty.&quot;<br />
<br />
In my opinion, if I were to compare this anime to all the other anime I&#039;ve watched until now, I&#039;d say this show is unique in a certain aspect.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s rare that I get to experience an anime wherein which the artistry and the visual aspect of anime itself moves me deeply.<br />
<br />
Symbolisms. These are underated elements that are unseen to some people in the naked eye but I tend to look at each show&#039;s symbolisms and imageries, as these hold a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review82340">
        secret yet an immense meaning behind them. Symbolisms appeared all over the anime, which is one reason why I like it. Masks, concealing your true identity, indeed a parasite that eventually becomes a part of you as it isolates you from your real self and lives you a life of a fraudulent person. Keys, a symbolism pertaining to the key that opens new doors, new doors in life. Paper airplanes, they soar through the vicinity of the endless horizon, aiming not only high but also forward amidst the sky. Indeed, this series held a bunchful of symbolisms and each one had a distinct and incredible meaning.<br />
<br />
The songs used in this anime are also absolutely beautiful. “Music is what feelings sound like,” and I believe that the feelings felt in each and every song were portrayed to the utmost perfection. A big commendation to the song, A Moon Filled Sky. The violin&#039;s tune and melody along with the lyric&#039;s message, with them combined, they are able to form a song that brings about feelings of happiness, melancholy, nostalgia, pain and love all at once. Songs like this bring me to tears and bring me to LSS.<br />
<br />
The set-up of the plot, finally, was also plotted out nicely. The story was indeed unique and not cliché. Each series featured multiple stories of a couple&#039;s story towards their journey of reaching one another and they were able to balance out the interest of each story.<br />
<br />
2. INTELLECTUAL VALUE: 10/10<br />
&quot;Intellectual value refers to the anime stimulating thought. It enriches our mental life by making us realize fundamental truths about life and human nature.&quot;<br />
<br />
Who wouldn&#039;t learn anything after seeing two seasons that foretold true love, pain and anguish of separation? ef - a tale of melodies. was packed with fundamental yet unrealized truths about life itself.<br />
<br />
Every conflict each character faced through, every action each character did, every consequence each character faced is already a realization of the fundamental truth that goodness begets goodness.<br />
<br />
3. SUGGESTIVENESS: 10/10<br />
&quot;Suggestiveness is the quality associated with the emotional power shown and experienced by the audience.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wow, I was moved throughout the whole course of the series, both of them, especially this sequel.<br />
<br />
Practically, every wavering scene moved my heart. When conflicts appeared and in consequence, caused sadness with each presented couple, when an answer that could solve the problem appeared and eventually did and then they fell happily ever after. In all these moments, strong emotion built up inside of me, I almost wanted to cry but I didn&#039;t, as if I did, I would be interfering the flow of the show.<br />
<br />
The very fact that I forced myself not to cry in order to waver the feelings in my heart more while watching the show already raises a 10/10 for suggestiveness, no doubt.<br />
<br />
Intense emotions, emitted both in the scene and on the audience&#039;s point of view, that is the true epitome of suggestiveness.<br />
<br />
4. SPIRITUAL VALUE: 10/10<br />
&quot;Spiritual value is the quality wherein which the show elevates the spirit by bringing out moral values which make us better persons.&quot;<br />
<br />
I consider the spiritual value of the show the most among all the other aspects. If I learn something out of it, if I&#039;m able to change myself for the better thanks to a show, that show deserves a 10/10 for changing an individual&#039;s life.<br />
<br />
&quot;To keep on dreaming... that&#039;s the first step to making a dream come true.&quot;<br />
<br />
This show led me to realize that miracles do happen, dreams do come true and that nothing is impossible. All of them had a simple way for them all to be true and that is to never give up.<br />
<br />
Life. Oh yes, it is undoubtedly going to be one hell of a journey. You&#039;re going to experience loneliness, anguish, despair and all other painful moments at some point in your life but in the same time, you will experience the greatest feelings you will ever have such as love, happiness and joy, as featured in this show. Everyone in the story had a happy end with an everlasting shine, nevertheless of all the painful experiences they&#039;ve went through.<br />
<br />
This show gave light to life, despite this world&#039;s cruel society, with all the corrupt officials, merciless murderers, deceiving friends. The show singlehandedly inspired me to look at life in a much greater aspect than I had seen it before. I am just pumped up with inspiration and motivation to strive for the best right now so I can live my life to the fullest after watching such a masterpiece.<br />
<br />
5. PERMANENCE: 10/10<br />
&quot;Permanence is shown when a great show endures time and space. Thus, it immortalizes its maker along with the show itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not gonna forget this show for a long time, I can guarantee that. After all I&#039;ve learned from the story, there&#039;s no way I&#039;ll immediately forget it. The moral messages shown throughout the series, those words will soon turn into actions of kindness in my case. I keep in mind that if I learn something, I will always apply it into action to further engrave the message into my mind and into my life.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 10/10 or 10/10<br />
<br />
My overall score may seem a bit exaggerated but what I grade it is true. ef - a tale of melodies. is one of the most magnificent masterpieces of anime I&#039;ve seen in my whole history of watching anime. If you were to hear my opinion whether this is worthy enough to watch, all I can say is that it won&#039;t be a waste of time and that you won&#039;t regret watching it. Infact, if you&#039;re not watching it yet and you are reading this review, you better stop reading and start watching and I bid you happiness as you watch the series where you indeed can and will hear the melody of truth. ;)

    i went into watching ef with no recommendations and decided to see it all the way though. it ended up becoming my #3 favorite anime. i found myself caring for each of the characters as though they were truly here with me. episode 6 of this anime had me in goosebumps the entire time and it is something i will never forget. i highly recommend this anime.

    This anime really surprised me by way it was told and the characters relationships. It was a really good anime with a great plot and music that complimented the moments to create additional emotion. It was the first in this genre that I&#039;ve ever watched and it blew me away easily becoming my favorite anime so far and I doubt that&#039;ll change. The show was really interesting and I wasn&#039;t bored as there was always something I was interested in. I loved this anime and think its one of the few masterpieces out there and would recommend it to anyone whether they watch anime or

     Very infrequently one comes across an exquisitely presented work of art that mesmerises, thrills and captivates. With every passing glimpse, the spectator is left with a plethora of emotions and a stream of portentous thoughts reverberating around their mind like a pulsating ocean. “Ef: A Tale of Melodies” is a tour de force of this calibre that elicits the full range of emotions from the astonished viewer who is left with a fuller perception of the triumphs and hardships of life. Struggles, achievement and benevolent bonds between individuals encompass life, a reality that is elegantly portrayed by “Ef: A Tale of Melodies” as a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review211629">
        cast of remarkably believable characters coalesces with a gracefully crafted storyline of immense distinctiveness. This series is the sequel to the exceptional “Ef: A Tale of Memories” that was in itself a truly singular accomplishment; in many ways the sequel is able to serenely surpass the original. <br />
 <br />
 Taking place after the first instalment, “Ef: A Tale of Melodies” entangles the mysteries of most of the supporting characters from the original series. The series uses a narrative similar to the first instalment as two separate and parallel plotlines are successfully portrayed. Yuu Himura is the diligent and assiduous protagonist of the first story which is set years in the past; he is depicted as a determined young man who is intrinsically fixated with maintaining his topmost academic position at Otowa Academy. At school he fatefully comes across an enigmatic girl by the name of Yuuko Amamiya who, to his stark bewilderment, appears to clearly recognise him. From this point the viewer begins to be enthralled by a quintessential emotional voyage as memories from a detached and tragic childhood, fragments of a difficult past rather left irretrievable, begin to come back to Yuu through his encounters with Yuuko. This consequential reunion with Yuuo causes Yuu to once again confront the dejections and resentments of their shared past and present- it sets Yuu on the altruistic path to save Yuuko from a history of violent abuse. Yuu Himura is a young man who carries many intricacies; he is depicted as an archetypal pessimist whose negativity borders upon nihilism and a confused individual who is chronically indecisive. Through his interactions with Yuuko Amamiya, person who displays immense kindness and emotional rigour amidst arduous circumstances, we see the maturation and mental development of an individual who was initially tentative about life. Both characters are effectively portrayed but the encounters between the two can at times be overly dramatic to the point where some scenes lose their realism.  Nonetheless, this story is strikingly well-developed and perhaps the more superior plotline of the series as it induces sorrow, anger and pity through characters that ultimately convey an emboldening sense of equanimity. <br />
 <br />
 The second plotline, which focuses on the present -day lives of Shuuchi Kuze and Mizuki Hayama, is the weaker story since it is not as emotionally charged and distinctive as Yuu and Yuuko’s arc. Due to slower pacing it lacks the gallop of anxiety and the vivid suspense that makes the first story so transfixing; Kuze’s arc is fascinating and well portrayed but the individual scenes are not as well executed as the impeccably weaved melodrama of Yuu’s melancholic past. With regard to the story, Shuuchi may appear to be a definitive womaniser but it soon becomes clear that he is indeed a truly convoluted and tragic character who craves isolation. Yet by sheer chance he comes across a girl by the name of Mizuki Hayama who is infatuated by him as soon as she hears the alluring and ravishing sounds of his violin performance. It is later established that Shuuchi is suffering from a terminal condition and that his days are severely numbered; amidst this reality he has decided to cut off all of his relationships and submit to a sequestered demise. The poignancy of Shuuchi’s character is exceptionally portrayed as the producers skilfully craft an atmosphere that almost forces the viewer to become sympathetic to his condition and struggles. Mizuki Hayama, however, is a person who will not let him perish alone and without resistance; Mizuki attempts to become closer to the dismissive Shuuchi, giving rise to an incipient romance that is blighted by the dejecting shadow of imminent tragedy. The arc is deficient in the emotional melodrama that the first story so powerfully portrayed but on its own, Shuuchi’s plotline is compellingly enacted due to a profound and deeply resonating message- through force of will and sheer determination one can valiantly confront their struggles. The two plotlines introduce a thoroughly engrossing psychological element as the producers give regular insights about the thoughts dominating the characters’ minds, which increases the emotional rapport between the viewer and the cast. Both Shuuchi and Mizuki are flawed characters whose pretensions of ebullience are a façade to mask their own mental conflicts and inner anguishes. The pragmatism through which they are portrayed is a major strength of the plotline since the viewer is able to relate to the characters through a tender heart and sentimental perspective. The viewer is also delightfully reacquainted with the characters from the original series, such as Renji, Chihiro and Kei, which expands the range of the series. Ultimately, both arcs coalesce at as Yuu confronts Shuuchi which engenders a flawlessly weaved narrative that will be cemented in the viewer’s memories.<br />
<br />
   “Ef: A Tale of Melodies” is a technical and artistic masterpiece as every scene is meticulously and elegantly crafted- the artwork is singularly detailed and among the finest one will see. So many visual techniques, such as silhouettes and colour contrasts, are utilised to give rise to a series with unrivalled presentation that can be described as a chef-d&#039;oeuvre. The soundtrack, including the themes and opening, is impressive in that it immaculately accompanies the most portentous and emotionally riveting scenes of the series to ascertain that they firmly resonate with the viewer. <br />
 <br />
 Through assiduously presented features, a narrative that captures every possible human emotion and a cast of thoroughly relatable characters, “Ef: A Tale of Melodies” establishes itself as a series with few equals. Whilst the series has some flaws, its accurate depiction of the strengths and flaws of human nature is remarkable and gives rise to an idiosyncratic series that will capture the hearts and imagination of any viewer. Watching “Ef: A Tale of Melodies” is like witnessing an artist who is painting the successor to his greatest work; his skills have been refined, his technique has matured and his mind is more focused. The series is an artistic stroke of genius that transcends convention through its idiosyncrasies and poignantly elicits emotion in the most effective of manners.<br />

    Finally got to watch this after catching up on other animes and this one is a good one and a must see.<br />
<br />
The main story in my opinion is mostly renji-kun life, they had other small stories for everyone else, but most of it i believe leans more to renji. Renji always walks down a railroad track which has been broken for a long time, he meets a girl name Chihiro Shindou while he is walking. they start to talk alot and get to know each other, he has been warned not to fall in love with her and if he does, he will have to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review163259">
        face what happens afterwards. Renji finds out that chihiro has a memory of a 13 hour life span, she can only remember 13 hours of her life, she always brings a diary with her and writes everything down so when she wakes up in the morning, she knows what she did they day before. Renji falls in love with her despite the fact of her condition and helps her with a dream she always wanted to do but was nearly impossible because of her condition, which is to write a novel. Anything else i say will basically be spoilers but for some reason i believe the main character in the short stories they have in this anime, renji would be the most important one.<br />
<br />
The art in this anime is beautiful. you have your summer Christmas in a different country, then your winter Christmas in japan. Not only that this anime is all about art, the characters in the anime love to draw, one is a manga artist for example, so seeing all the art and pictures they make themselves is very good.<br />
<br />
This is an overall good anime, you&#039;ll need to watch this first before watching ef a tale of melodies, so please watch memories first then melodies, but dont forget to bring something to wipe your tears with after watching this anime, this anime is all about love and romance and how far someone will go to be with someone they fell in love with.

    This is not simple to watch! <br />
I am a grown man, but i have never in my life cried so much as trough this so called anime series. It is impossible to call this a simple anime. It touches your heart to the deepest level!<br />
<br />
I recommend this to people that love sad romance stories. But i do not recommend it for people like me, which have high level of empathy. I cried at almost every serie. <br />
<br />
A true master piece

    Story: The story in &amp;quot;melodies&amp;quot; is definitely better than in &amp;quot;memories&amp;quot;. Once again, we have two storylines- One focusing on the past of Himura (the guy with white hair), and the the other on Mizuki (Kei&#039;s blonde friend).  After watching &amp;quot;melodies&amp;quot;, i realised that issues of characters from season one were rather... Shallow. For example, the whole problem of &amp;quot;love triangle&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;memories&amp;quot; is really weak in comparision with Yuuko and Himura relationship. The ending was much more convincing as well. If it is about the second story, it&#039;s very similar to Chichiro&#039;s issue from season one. The main difference lies in intensity of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12341">
        the story, though i can&#039;t write anything more, because it might spoil the fun.<br />
<br />
Art: It was really solid. Character design haven&#039;t changed, but the animation got better, and much more artistic eksperiments were used. There are some memorable scenes, but no suprises- you are probably used to the unusual directing if you watched &amp;quot;memories&amp;quot;<br />
<br />
Sound: Nice, but nothing out of ordinary. There are no tracks that you would remember after finishing whole series, but they match the scenes, and are quite enjoyable. The opening is very similar to the opening from the first season, but it has a nice feeling to it. <br />
<br />
Character: The main characters in &amp;quot;melodies&amp;quot; are very well made, and i liked them much more than main characters in &amp;quot;memories&amp;quot;. I felt that they are more mature and convincing, but their development was rather predictable. Still- better than in first season.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I believe everybody will find something they will like in &amp;quot;ef - a tale of melodies&amp;quot;. The story is quite intense (for a drama series), but short (12 episodes). Personally, i finished it in two days, so i didin&#039;t get too attached to the whole series, but i still find it very amusing, and i don&#039;t regret one minute spent in front of the screen. <br />
<br />
Overall: Great piece of work. Everything is solid and well-made, so i gave the series 9. If you didin&#039;t liked the first season, i don&#039;t think you will like the second, because it basicly extends the ideas from the first one. However, it&#039;s worth a try, since it&#039;s a a little bit better.
