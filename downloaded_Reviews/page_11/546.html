    You’ve probably heard the phrase “knowledge is power”. One of the fundamental elements of power comes from books and even in our modern world today, that phrase remains as true as ever. Ascendance of a Bookworm attributes to a bookworm named “Myne” who is reincarnated into another world as she hopes to regain her ability to read.<br />
<br />
With the amount of isekai anime coming out in recent years, it’s easy to paint this show as another clone. However, you should actually take a careful look into this anime and see it more of as a slice of life isekai. What does that mean? In some ways,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324769">
        Ascendance of a Bookworm contains fantasy elements but also relies a lot more on realism than what people will realize. The first episode drops main protagonist Myne into a world of uncertainty. It doesn’t take long for her to adjust to her newfound life as she carves for books and love of reading. To her, reading books is equivalent to a life necessity and she would do anything to get her hands on them.<br />
<br />
We shouldn’t judge on Myne too much. She’s a child who is eager to learn and explore. My impression of the show at first is that of a slow paced story to teach us about the person Myne really is. She’s an innocent girl who is staring a new life with a passion to collect books. On the surface, she is a kind girl who is also eager to make friends. Considering the difficulty to acquiring them in the new world, it comes to no surprise that she would have to use some creativity to further her ambitions. She experiments with inventing objects associated with books and begins to gain a reputation among their society. This is where a certain level of realism comes in. Throughout the anime, the show rarely relies on magic when inventions are made. Most of it comes down to trial and error in the hands of Myne’s ideas. Ironically, Myne seems to be suffering from a mystical mana related illness that often puts her into a weakened state. This happens often in the show where viewers may wonder if her life is at jeopardy. The main plot doesn’t devote too much time into this although it does limit Myne’s abilities to make books and inventions. Instead, we are treated with a show that focuses on the life of Myne and her character. Whether you like her or not, this is an anime that dedicates time into exploring the reincarnated life of a bookworm.<br />
<br />
And as the starring protagonist, it didn’t take long for Myne to establish meaningful relationships in the show. Myne is highly protective of her family where in one particular episode, she shows a dangerous side of her after they were threatened. It’s the type of bond that translates into how much she values her family. Similarly, Myne makes friends with the locals including a young child named Lutz. As someone close to her age, Lutz often looks after her well-being and they forge a close relationship. While the anime doesn’t truly dedicate them as a couple, there’s some charming amount of teases that fans can imagine. Other close relationships Myne develops throughout the show includes Eva, Ralph, Turi, and others who realizes how kind and gentle she is. Even someone as stubborn as the merchant Benno sees her good side despite not showing it. However, I should say off the bat that most of the anime is focused on Myne. Most of the characterization is limited to our protagonist so it may disappoint some people if they wish to see more depth into the other cast members. Thankfully, the character chemistry among the cast is charming and often embedded to get us to understand Myne more.<br />
<br />
I’m not going to lie though. Watching Ascendance of a Bookworm can be a bit of a chore sometimes due to its repetitive story nature. Most of the episodes revolves with the same concept of storytelling and recycled themes. With each passing episode, it’s easy to see how slowed pace the show is. Unlike most isekai, you won’t find much action. This actually feels more like a coming-of-age slice of life but taking place in fictional fantasy world. There’s a balanced amount of drama and comedy that shouldn’t be overlooked. The drama comes from Myne living her new life but often facing obstacles when she isn’t prepared for. Meanwhile, the comedy comes from Myne’s own imaginative mind that often takes the shape of cartoonish skits. I mean, she is a child after all and her imaginations are limitless. It’s often played for laughs but also shows how open minded she can be. For a bookworm, she definitely shows exactly why she loves books.<br />
<br />
As someone who has read the novels, the 14-episode anime adaptations serves more as a baseline to get viewers into the franchise. Make no mistake though, there’s definitely more that I wish to see being adapted. But on the plus side, I do welcome studio Ajia-Do’s effort into making the show as colorful and vibrant as it can be. As an anime that doesn’t rely on magic, the show tells some surprising amount of choreography with the body language and character designs. In fact, characters looks like they belong in this setting with their simple clothing and everyday lifestyle. The most noticeable character is protagonist Myne. Designed with a frail and petite look, there’s no doubt people will see vulnerability in her character. Also, I would also give praise to the voice acting to her character as taking on the role of a child is no easy task. Yet, voice actress Yuka Iguchi is able to portray Myne perfectly. It’s exactly how I pictured Myne as a character bought to life in animated form.<br />
<br />
If you’re a fan of isekai anime, this may be something unorthodox that you’re not used to. Rather than a decorating itself as a fantasy adventure, Ascendence of a Bookworm explores more of the mundane life of a bookworm. I can’t say it’s easy to recommend this show with the story’s slow pacing. But if you want a different type of isekai than what you see too often these days, then this anime might just surprise you.

    To round off this year of abysmal drops in the bucket from the rusty spigot tapped into the vast ocean of low-effort isekai anime still waiting down the pipeline, “Ascendance of a Bookworm” hit me like a brief mouthful of ambrosia that I desperately desired. <br />
<br />
There are only so many ways to frame an isekai anime nowadays, it’s like when Fox announces they’ve renewed The Simpsons for another 3 seasons and realizes, “Haven’t we already done everything?” In this regard, Bookworm isn’t exactly novel when you think about how it recontextualizes this tired concept. It’s not an original concept, but it’s one that recognizes the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324770">
        charming beauty of its simplicity. <br />
<br />
To put it simply, Bookworm is a tight and focused character-piece that neither preoccupies itself with empty flash or needless frills. It feels deceptively quaint and almost procedural compared to most high-concept isekai anime. Its scale is cleverly stripped back, its pace slowed to a manageable stroll, and its tone kept consistently light to taste. Bookworm’s centerpiece is Maine, a delightfully original spin on tired isekai protagonist tropes.  <br />
<br />
Maine incrementally and deliberately progresses through her world much slower than you’d expect of normal protagonists. She is thoroughly constrained by the fact that she is now a sickly young girl on the lower-end of the tax-bracket and social pecking-order. The only thing that Maine really has going for her is her vast retention of book-knowledge, but don’t expect her to go full Senkuu any time soon. Bookworm embraces the mundanities of plausible conflict. Maine is a child (one who frequently suffers from an otherworldly fever) and at that one who actively lacks the resources to overcome short-term goals because of her social class. Bookworm never feels overbearing despite this. It never beats you over the head with misery-porn or begs you to feel sorry for Maine&#039;s situation, not that there aren&#039;t occasional emotional beats peppered throughout its episode count. Instead, Maine is both intrepid and charming, taking her failures in stride with a childlike irreverence.   <br />
<br />
Save for towards the very end, I never really got the sense that the show was trying to hold Maine’s hand by introducing a plot-contrivance or hand-out that would get the ball rolling. Bookworm’s idea of trial and error is one of very gradual progression, and it makes those smaller victories all the more satisfying when Maine does clear her hurdles. <br />
<br />
Bookworm was a consistently low-key and understated viewing experience. Despite the darker implications of Maine’s reincarnation, the show never makes it a point to become overtly shocking for the sake of creating a tonal dissonance. I’m happy that Bookworm both decided to address this detail and show a commendable amount of restraint by not playing up the melodrama. Bookworm posits the question, is this world better off now that Motosu Urano has become a surrogate for this young girl who perished under the noses of her family? Is it fine for this family to keep living under the pretense that the daughter they once knew continues to live under their roof? <br />
<br />
Bookworm’s real meat comes in the form of Maine’s identity crisis. Maine is fully cognizant of how she has essentially deceived everyone into thinking there’s nothing going on beneath the surface. This is a subplot explored through the character of Lutz. Being forced to sort of play along with Maine’s antics, Lutz begins to cultivate a deeper relationship than he previously had with her, as well as a suspicion for her true identity. This eventually culminates in one of the most cathartic and emotionally potent scenes I’ve seen in an anime in recent memory, but you kind of just have to see it to believe it. It’s simply wonderful watching this character accept both her new identity and her new family as her own. Looming fever aside, there’s always a sense of dread that Maine will have to confront her conflict of identity again and that it might just come crashing down on her. It’s an effectively simple conflict that I wish more isekai anime would take the time to explore. <br />
<br />
Technically speaking, Bookworm isn’t all that impressive as it doesn’t particularly necessitate flashy action set-pieces. There are endearing gag sequences where the art-design will completely flip into a stylized chibi format but those don’t tend to last more than a couple of seconds and are mostly used as eye-catches to transition between scenes. The character designs lack the edge that you’d expect from an anime in this genre, although I wouldn’t necessarily consider that a bad thing. As always, Yuka Iguchi is excellent and characterizes Maine with her typical brand of saucy sarcasm.  <br />
<br />
Ascendance of a Bookworm is Dr. Stone for those who were let-down by its over-the-top antics and seemingly infallible protagonist. It’s pragmatic almost to a fault, and a show that I wouldn’t easily recommend to viewers not willing to get caught up in its slower pace. If you’re like me and have resigned yourself as an unabashed isekai garbage-eater, Bookworm might just be what the doctor ordered. Ascendance of a Bookworm was a classic case of a show far surpassing my expectations and one I learned to love more and more with each passing episode. Bookworm is as warm and comforting as curling up with a good book, and I’m sure that’s the sentiment it wanted to leave us with until its second season.

    This is currently my favorite isekai anime as of making this review. <br />

I understand having favorite and isekai next to each other is in itself like a cardinal sin in the anime community. But hear me out, it’s unlike every other brain numbing action fantasy isekai. It’s not when Kirito— sorry, some dumb, brokenly strong character gets bitches and slays any monster without real consequences. Ascendance of a Bookworm gets what so many other isekai get wrong. <br />
<br />
Ascendance of a Bookworm is a isekai, but that’s not really what sells the show for me. It’s the slice of life that makes me adore Maine the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321529">
        MC, and the world she is in. Maine comes from another world (You see where this is going) and dreams of being a librarian. When she is reincarnated in this new world she is not some action hero or a comedy/parody isekai. She is a sickly poor girl in an uneducated household. She is also insanely physically weak. Not able to even walk down the stairs to leave her house, let alone walk down the street to save her life. Right off the bat one can tell that this isekai at the very least is going to try another approach and a different approach on the isekai genre. <br />
<br />
Another huge aspect of Ascendance of a Bookworm is that her one true goal in life is to just read a book. I mean one could probably find that out from the title but it presents that this anime is about the simple struggles in life. It’s relatable in a sense that not everyone gets to have a normal life. Not everyone gets the same starting place and gets the so called short end of the stick. It’s a freaking isekai that doesn’t start in the kings palace and is given everything because they are the hero that will slay the evil of the nation. <br />
<br />
Have I told you how wholesome this anime is? Like damn, this makes me wanna just restart my life and focus on the simple problems. Maine is a determined, strong mined, main character. Watching her make progress and also fail is very enjoyable. Since Maine is in a poor, uneducated household she has more hurdles than most. Books in the time period she is in is only made for the wealthy. Paper cost a small fortune too. Maine doesn’t even know how to write in their language. <br />
<br />
Adolescence of a Bookworm is also kinda educational. In a time where normal conveniences have not been not been invented Maine makes due and learns about this world just like the viewer. As Maine progresses in the anime she brings in innovations from modern times that really come in handy. One learns about the inequality of the times and how even taking a shower was not even an option.<br />
<br />
The originality of this anime makes me smile. As this anime gets more episodes I cannot wait to see what Maines next step forward will be. Is this the perfect isekai? No, not at all. But what Ascendance of a Bookworm does right is how changing what can be done with the genre of isekai can make what seems like a dead genre into one with innovation. This is the perfect anime to watch after being on the seasonal grind and have watched your 100th isekai anime. The art is appealing to the eye and is more stylized than most generic isekai. The music is minimalistic but also cinematic at times and does it’s purpose. It’s best to try to not focus on the isekai troupes or character troupes in this anime otherwise I’ll just get under your skin and bother you. Otherwise it’s so much fun watching!<br />
<br />
I recommend Adolescence of a Bookworm to everyone no matter how much experience you with anime. But I especially recommend this anime to anyone who is on the seasonal grind and needs an anime to relax to.

    The premise of the anime, at least in the Synopsis section made it feel like it was going to be something interesting and out of the ordinary. Turned out to be one whiny anime riddled with plot holes and plot armor left and right.<br />
<br />
Even in the first episode when the protagonist gets the memories of the body it now inhabits, she doesn&#039;t get all of them and starts looking through the house for books as if she doesn&#039;t already have the memory of the body that there are no books there.<br />
<br />
This trend of things not making any sense continues as the anime develops. The most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327333">
        striking of all is all other characters, like her sister, her friend and his brothers, all act too mature for their age. These kids are supposed to be ages 5 and 7 and yet they act like they are 25-27 all the time. When you make a story where your characters are 5 and 7 old, either make them act like it, or just make them older.<br />
<br />
The characters are the worst imaginable as they all act like the main character, except they don&#039;t have her 21 century planet Earth knowledge. Seeing a 5 year old acting and deducting like he is in his 20s is just laughable. I know anime and manga like to portray young character like 13-15-17 to be more mature than their age, but this is just getting out of hand and being the most ridiculous thing I&#039;ve seen in many years.<br />
<br />
As the story unfolds during the 12 episodes, I expected more &quot;greatness&quot; from the show, with the last few episodes being the culmination. All that happened was the last scene with the head priest, the rest has been just boring and uneventful chatter about unimportant things and the occasional (probably supposed to be funny, but come off just retarded) moment where the main character shows her version of &quot;Inner Sakura&quot;, which got boring and retarded in Naruto back in the day and it&#039;s stupid still now. The second part of the show was the one that felt like it was losing its direction and the plot armor created for the last episode built by Benno the merchant is just awful. The anime ends with a happy ending that made everything (no matter how little or insignificant it was) feel like it was meaningless.<br />
<br />
The anime feels like a toned down, more boring and whinier version of Dr. Stone where inventions are put aside and whiny, meaningless dialogue is the forefront.<br />
<br />
I watched this anime out of sheer curiosity seeing how high score and placement it has, so I thought it was good. It was different, I give it that, but the nature of it was too whiny and stupid for my taste, also those plot holes and plot armors become even more visible in an anime with no fighting. Fighting works to cover up the shortcomings of an anime, because it&#039;s a change of pace and viewers don&#039;t give it too much thought. Back around 2010 I watched some Yaoi anime called Gravitation, I don&#039;t like this genre as with my track record, I prefer shounen, thriller and mystery anime, mostly with fighting, so I don&#039;t even know why I watched that anime back then, but it felt weird, I didn&#039;t care for the story, but just pushed through, because it was only 12 episodes and didn&#039;t want to have dropped an anime. Now I don&#039;t know why I watched it, but this one feels the same way - I only pushed through it, because I hoped it would get better, but it didn&#039;t, it only got worse in the end. If there is a second season, I won&#039;t be watching it.

    Honzuki No Gekokujou is a phenomenal anime. It has great characters, drama, story and pacing that is so perfect it makes you want to watch it all in one go. <br />
<br />
When I started watching the anime I felt like this would be a boring Isekai from the first 3 episodes but I&#039;m glad to say this was very far from it. What I thought was going to be a disappointing anime turned to be one of the best if not the best alongside Iruma-kun. This anime also has some of the best character development I have seen in an anime. <br />
<br />
The characters in the anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324840">
        are great. We start with the main female MC who is a girl that loves books so much she can&#039;t live without them in a world with very few books in them and only available for the rich. She starts off as an annoying little girl but she gets such a great development that you can&#039;t help but love her even if you didn&#039;t at the start of the anime. We get introduced to her family who are so loving and kind people. We see the main lover interest who isn&#039;t just a random kid, it is a kid with a dream who works so hard to both achieve the dream and help take care of Maine. He also had great development later specially after knowing who Maine really is in one of the best episodes of the entire anime. <br />
<br />
The plot of the anime and its pace were also great. While the first 3 eps may have been a bit slow, the story starts to make progress and you start seeing the drama settle in and more exciting stories, problems and characters start appearing everywhere. I really can&#039;t wait to watch the 2nd season. <br />
<br />
The art, animation and overall sound were fantastic and great work to the voice actors who played a phenomenal role and fit almost every character that was introduced. I loved Maine&#039;s voice so much and how it changed based on how she was feeling and which character was talking. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall I would give the anime a 9/10. It was a hidden gem and it was extremely entertaining to watch. <br />
I would recommend it to non anime fans if they want a great story with great characters in it.

    Isekai Bookworm: the Isekai we needed but didn&#039;t deserve, and furthermore, the most underrated and least watched Isekai of the season, that&#039;s at least getting a continuation in Spring 2020 for its 2nd cour...like how great is that! It&#039;s almost like in the slew of all-too-familiar Isekai LNs that purge the same formula as if that&#039;s the ONLY way to make it interesting, that Ascendance of a Bookworm FINALLY saw the change towards that formula to forge and become its very own thing.<br />
<br />
*Spoilers be warned*<br />
<br />
In the sense of realism, Isekai Bookworm retains the fantasy that the genre is all but known for, but with the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324790">
        twist that this is actually more of a slice-of-life than the fantastical elements it bargains at the beginning, and all but perishes it right from the start, as evident from the MC Maine (or Myne as the manga/LN states). Originally a girl named Urano Motosu who has substantial interest in books and literature with a dream to be a librarian one day, her life was cut short but not without hoping to see the dream be realized in her reincarnated afterlife. When fate strikes her a chord, she awakes into a 5-year old girl living in the Medieval era town of Ehrenfest, except that body that her soul is tugged into isn&#039;t as healthy as she&#039;d thought. The body, frail and weak from an occurring disease, can only be cured if her passion is kept reeling in a.k.a books and literature, and so that dream she had from before, becomes her conquest to make and create modern things in old times.<br />
<br />
First things off the bat, Isekai Bookworm is unlike similar brethrens out there trying to play the Hero counterpart to defeat evildoers, but rather, focuses on the one element that keeps it going: to find books in primitive times, because paper isn&#039;t common at all. Furthermore, the sole reason for Maine&#039;s purpose to find paper can even be referred to as a kid&#039;s struggle in trying to find something of interest in a world that the word &quot;invention&quot; doesn&#039;t really ring a bell towards its citizens. To make matters even worse, Maine&#039;s &quot;upbringing&quot; in a poor family doesn&#039;t make things any better for her as materials of paper and even books are only available for the wealthy, not to mention the ancient language that she supposedly has a hard time settling into at the start.<br />
<br />
To counteract all this, Maine would befriend many of the character cast, starting with the family who has it rough to always take care and watch out for her flailing health: father Gunther, mother Effa and elder sister Turi, who were the first people to notice Maine&#039;s progress in both her wellbeing and inventive innovations whilst prepping her for the medieval world&#039;s terms and conditions. Along with Gunther&#039;s friend Otto&#039;s help to teach Maine about the ancient language, and Lutz, Maine&#039;s childhood friend shows up along the way when she decides that her paper-making process (that he has witnessed) be turned into a for-profit business, all looks set for the plan to be in motion. And whaddya know, his dream of being a merchant coincides with Maine&#039;s interest of selling her stuff, much to Otto&#039;s rejection being an afterthought, the two decided to cooperate, and taken to Merchant Benno, who&#039;d supervise their business and lay off others who&#039;d want a slice of their business for ulterior motives. And you know the intricacies of mere 5-6 year-olds in business where Maine literally has an adult&#039;s mind that shocks even the most seasoned merchants, but could still potentially be cheated due to the aggravating giveaways of her weak health. Regardless, this character cast, especially MC Maine is what hooks me onto this show for reasons.<br />
<br />
Probably what will turn people off from this anime is the entire slice-of-life regime that is flushed all around, but trust me, that same regime is what draws me into this show with awe and fascination, at how the world could be different for what it is, going back to being children and solving problems with mistakes and failures that aren&#039;t offset from growing human life. Maine makes no attempts to sweep her failures under the rug, as her experimentation allows her to know what does and does not work to make her paper-making business flourish, and along with her &quot;secret stash&quot; of modern-day knowledge and education to teach the others and be wowed by such items. If you don&#039;t get what I&#039;m trying to infer here, is that everything is damn wholesome and educational that I can&#039;t shift my eyes away from it to see what would Maine&#039;s next step forward is gonna bring onto the table.<br />
<br />
Ajia-Do Animation Works&#039; visuals are just perfect for this anime, the art being reminiscent of one being very light and a great mix of color palettes along with the many Maine-chibi forms of educational explanation content that are easy to watch and have fun alongside it. On the animation side, I&#039;m just glad that there was just the right amount of animation, given that there are still sprinkles of the bits and pieces of low-budget work that exist within the anime, but are not glaringly noticeable that it affects the overall quality. Music-wise, lots of lightheartedness (and some serious notes) with the world and its worldbuilding established from the setting that it does mimic so well, and same goes to the cheery atmospheric and lovely OST by both Sumire Moroboshi and Megumi Nakajima.<br />
<br />
For one, I&#039;m sure that this isn&#039;t the end of Maine and her world-building shenanigans, as we&#039;ll have to wait until the 2nd cour to flesh out more of what&#039;s to come of her sickness and how that affects the people she abides by. But as much as this Iyashikei of a feeling this anime has, it&#039;s certainly one to take on a chill ride. It&#039;s very personal too and it never stops being intriguing to see things through, if that is ever anything to win hearts by.

    It’s going to be a fairly lengthy review since I want newcomers to know how critically underappreciated this show is. If you want a shorter review, there’s one on the final paragraphs. <br />
<br />
As a blossoming anime watcher, there are a lot of steps you naturally take in order to become the person with the most sophisticated taste from scratch, obviously. This is my first season, fall 2019, where I tried to hand pluck individual shows for my very own list. I have to say, finding that special show is difficult. There were just so many continuations and so many new shows that it was hard

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324733">
        to keep up with each and every one of them. <br />
<br />
It was in these harsh conditions, enlaced with a little bit of anime fever, where I got to learn more about show that I immensely enjoyed watching grow this season: <br />
“Honzuki no Gekokujou: Shisho ni Naru ni wa Shudan wo Erandeiraremasen” <br />
or <br />
“Ascendance of a Bookworm” in short+english. A story about a hard bookworm isekai’ed to a world without books. <br />
<br />
Bookworm was released in a season of a total of 5 other new isekais. Most of them rely heavily on immediately introducing an over-capable main character or using slapstick comedy to push the story forward, a trait that is popular among so many shows of the same genre throughout its recent trend. Bookworm, on the other hand, starts slowly, equaling the horsepower of a frail 5-year-old girl, which also happens to be a main trait of our main character, Maine (also spelled Myne and Main). <br />
The slow first 3 episodes are there to create an image of how weak Maine’s body is and how inaccessible seemingly ordinary objects or favors are in the other world that our MC finds herself in. The family is busy and struggling. Literature is a luxury. She&#039;s a victim of Isekai, not blessed by it. Though the choice of making her weak is a solid choice. Being a weak person means that Maine is going to pay more attention to her relations much more than if she were able to do everything herself. Making her weak means that everyone around her is important to her, and if she doesn’t get people to care for her, then she might lose the trust of a friend or family member who is several times stronger, more capable or more influential than she is. Her initial physical capabilities serves as a multifunctional plot device itself, and it deserves credit for staying loyal to what such a character trait promises. <br />
<br />
Eventually, the curse of slow pacing then gets broken down the more capable our MC is, whether it be physically or influentially. The closer our MC gets to achieving the goal of making literature easily accessible, the more she has to learn about her new world to make it happen, which means that the narrative is adjusted to newer settings and characters. Even the magic system is introduced as trivial facts, which makes sense since the social setting isn&#039;t very familiar with constant exposure to magic. Even though this is an isekai without power levels, but you feel a sense of progression here better than you would in most isekais with a bunch of spammed numbers flashed on the screen. Each episode ends with a small and specific victory or a happy accident, and no increase of mana can portray progression as well as getting results on something that you’ve been working hard on. <br />
The general predictability is minimal. Whenever you guess the next event, it’s because of the consistency of the storytelling and common sense from the characters rather than overused isekai tropes. The buildup is just honest, which is something that we rarely see in hard action or slice of life animes.<br />
<br />
The story is filled with conscious people surrounding Maine. Every mess she makes is noticed by others. People notice how polite she is. People get envious. People get greedy. People get suspicious. There are lots of pieces of humanity spread across the series. This results in a very comfortable social environment. The cast’s bystanders aren’t Maine’s launchpad for her own goals and dreams, nor are they exclusively deposits of expositions. The different shades of personalities are planned, not just a roll of the die. <br />
For example. So you know those anime characters who are the dedicated motivated character? Probably male, tall, fairly muscular compared to the rest of the cast, fiery hair and can&#039;t shut up about how he&#039;s the most motivated guy in the room? I&#039;ve only realized how sick I was of these characters until I&#039;ve seen the most beautiful boy Lutz in Bookworm. His most defining character trait is his love for Maine and his strength to stand up against his family’s expectations. Lutz sometimes faces conflicts where he knows he might not be able to do anything. But he still fights for his goals, even if he has lost so much hope. It&#039;s such a heart-warming thing to see, and you can&#039;t do anything but to root for him to be happier, making him succeed as a side character. <br />
<br />
Sadly, the art is fairly lacking. The animations can get choppy from time to time, the faces of the characters can seem wonky at times and the opening wasn’t visually impressive. Nevertheless, the characters have a fair share of character design that makes each character distinguishable from every other character, which is a big win. None of the main or main side characters look like each other. <br />
The sound design is good. The ending song is really chill, the medieval music/slice of life music hybrid fits so well with the whole show and the opening song is phenomenal. I know I might get into music theory a bit too much, but the odd time signature is a delightful surprise compared to the formulaic drum+guitar+bass+vocal kick/snare/kick/snare/sick solo combo these days. Basically, it’s a song that sounds natural to sing but hard to dance to, which is my kind of music. The sound effects is a bit off tho. It’s kinda hard to explain. The violins, lute and trumpets sound really uplifting. The piano intro is very recognizable and the singing is nice. <br />
But enough with the intro. The show does well to include small sound effects to make the watch more interesting, but sometimes the sound effect doesn’t fully fit. Although it’s not that bad for me to complain that much. <br />
<br />
I do have a couple of more things that I wished they did. The annoying first episode could have either been avoided or improved on. Maine starts as a one-trait character, and that’s introduced well with her constant minding the lack of literature. If we got a real isekai introduction at the start, where her personality fits in her former world, then we’d have a greater chance believing that she’ll develop in the new world without books. <br />
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
So for a quicker review, <br />
this was my anime of the season. For the past 3 months, I’ve enjoyed telling people, who haven’t heard of this show, to watch it. It stays true to its unique premise that is: &quot;If you, a hardcore bookworm, were sent back to the past in a younger body in a society without literature, what would you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
It’s a smart show for both being consistent in its niche ways and for how each obstacle that the MC has to conquer doesn’t seem out of place. It did its best to be as trope subverting as it can without telling you that it’s doing so. It succeeds as a show that focuses on the characters’ relations and emotions, which are more precious than the “depression” and “darkness” that many shows can’t live without. It’s definitely one of the sleepers this season. <br />
<br />
If you are going to watch this show, then I suggest that you focus on Maine’s growing love for everyone and everything in her new world, not just the books. It’s the driving force and backbone, and it would be much more enjoyable if that was where the viewers focused on. Go on, it won’t hurt you. <br />
<br />
Wholesome. Wholesome. Whole-lotta-some. Can’t wait for season 2. <br />

I watched this anime due to the high ratings it has been receiving on this website and I can say that it most certainly did not live up to them. Honzuki no Gekokujou is an isekai in which a japanese bookworm gets reincarnated into a sick five year old&#039;s body and lives as Myne/Main, the daughter of peasants. One of my primary gripes with this anime is the MCs mental age. Myne is meant to be at least a young adult, but instead acts and thinks like a child with the knowledge of an encyclopedia. Subsequently, she fumbles around social interaction with the emotional

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326456">
        intelligence of a child, not knowing how to handle her own position. <br />
<br />
People are praising this show for changing the isekai formula, but there isn&#039;t much substance past that. It&#039;s a slice of life show where the MC invents things from the future in a Middle Ages setting, if you enjoy that coupled with some wholesome family and friendship moments, you&#039;ll enjoy this. However, saying this show is anything more than a moe primitive technology from Youtube is giving it too much praise. Also, this idea of an MC inventing technology in an isekai is hardly unique to this show, and is handled with more thought in other novels and manga. <br />
<br />
Story: 4 <br />
There really is none, as I said the MC invents things in a Slice of Life manner while attempting to deal with the illness plaguing the body of Myne, who she spawned into. <br />
<br />
Art: 8 <br />
Art is good, around what one would expect from a modern anime. Animation is clearly a bit choppy at times, with the budget clearly not reaching Ufotable levels, but show still does a good job conveying the emotions of characters and the mood the author intended to create. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9 <br />
Quality sound, nothing to complain about especially, not extraordinary either. <br />
<br />
Characters: 4<br />
This really is the major flaw with this show, most of the characters are extremely shallow and the MCs actions are not what one would expect from one in her position. Myne is incredibly naive and the majority of the world reflects that same design, not testing the limits of her character. Would have made for a more interesting plot if there were characters that truly challenged the mood of the MC and show, but instead it stayed monotonous throughout, the characters interacting in a very fantastical and ideal manner to suite the others desired world. Thus, the characters were very cute but also quite shallow.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6 <br />
Was a fair waste of 5 hours or so, obviously watching the inventing process and cute relationship interactions was fun, but not anything overly stimulating either. The drama fell flat for the most part, as did the majority of the show, still was a decent time killer however as I had nothing else I wanted to do [Sry government, I&#039;ll do my taxes eventually].

    Bookworm is a perfect example of why preliminary reviews should not be allowed on this website and allowing them only lowers the credibility of MAL reviews.<br />
<br />
I truly must apologise to this series for writing it off when I first started watching it. When I made my first review for this show, I gave it a 6/10 after 4 episodes and felt that there was little to no substance here. I could not have been more wrong. It wasn&#039;t the show that had issues, it was me. It was the fact I wasn&#039;t appreciating the little things that make good storytelling and instead of substance, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325135">
        prioritised style. I&#039;m more than happy to admit I was wrong and that Bookworm is one of the best anime I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
Bookworm is an isekai, which may initially turn some people off, however, I promise you, it is not your typical isekai. There&#039;s no harems, battle scenes, crazy power scaling and OP Otaku self insert protags here. Instead, you have a middle aged Librarian being isekai&#039;d into the body of a frail young girl who is stricken with an illness and who&#039;s only objective is to be able to read books again. A simple premise, but a difficult objective as books in this world are reserved for only the most elite of nobles and are very expensive. Well, if you can&#039;t buy books, why not make them? <br />
<br />
Bookworm is extremely grounded and realistic in its storytelling, world building and even things like the magic system feel very real and down to Earth. What I truly appreciate about the series is that the emphasis is on the character development, interactions and economic repercussions of Maine&#039;s simple goal to start a bookshop. It&#039;s really the first isekai I&#039;ve seen since Log Horizon to be truly unique in that regard. Instead of focusing on how to beat the demon lord of a planet or how to get home, or how to become the world&#039;s strongest to save it from annihilation, Bookworm focuses on the real world implications of waking up in another world in a different body. How would you interact with your family and the people around you? How would you go about truly making this new life your own? <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re tired of the same old isekai after another with the same isekai starting town with the big white wall, you know the one I&#039;m talking about, and want something genuinely fresh, unique and most importantly, cute as fuck, this is the series for you. You will not be disappointed. I&#039;ve never seen Spice and Wolf, but from what I can gather, the themes and topics covered in the story are very similar to that, if that helps contextualise things for you. Bookworm gets a 10/10 and I can&#039;t wait to start reading it/for season 2.<br />
<br />
TL;DR Starts slow, but if you want a fresh and original take on Isekai, watch this.

    *contains spoilers up to episode 21 when I dropped it. I&#039;ve seen beyond this one season.*<br />
<br />
I was wondering why the ratings were so high as the previews looked like an isekai slice of life show meant for kids. That&#039;s exactly what you are getting and not much more. It&#039;s something you can turn on when you are wasted on a Saturday night and your mind can&#039;t form basic words, and it has its &quot;cute&quot; moments, but it definitely does not deserve an 8 with how childish, nonsensical and slow the plot is.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start off with some of the good things before I start rambling with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340248">
        a long diatribe. There can (initially) be some good moments of familial bonding and emotional interaction as the MC comes to accept her new family. The constant buildup of suspicion and the ultimate reveal when one of her friends learns that she is playing an impostor, and justifying the act, is a novel concept and convincingly led well into. (the question of whether the body of the girl she took over still contains the original soul and is alive or not is sadly ignored thereafter) Other isekai anime usually gloss over such an obvious rabbit hole. Her chronic illness seemed like an interesting handicap to keep her from turning into the next davinci too soon with her grand knowledge of yet to be discovered technology. She also uses that knowledge to drive the plot along instead of it relegated to making bento boxes or being completely ignored altogether. The show thus stays pretty decent in the first handful of episodes as you get to learn about and experience these things for the first time.<br />
<br />
But then the repetition starts kicking in, the intelligence of the characters become more and more questionable, and little things that were overlooked during the honeymoon phase start to grow irritating. It&#039;s hard to judge the simplistic nature of plotlines and interactions too harshly since this anime is ostensibly meant for kids, but I&#039;m ultimately reviewing this for anyone beyond the single digit age group.<br />
<br />
The MC is supposedly a very well read, intelligent young adult who died and had her soul transferred into a small child, but her mental capacity and mannerisms are frequently limited to that of said small child. This juxtaposes sharply against some of the thoughtful exchanges and critical thinking she delivers when recreating products, negotiating sale contracts, or arguing on equal terms with adults over political issues. As the show goes on, she becomes less and less capable and seemingly more and more clueless about the world around her, ignoring social decorum and blindsighted by the most obvious developments, while pouting frequently and prone to emotional outbursts. She basically devolves into a self-centered, screaming two year old toddler that can&#039;t understand anything and never learns anything or can see the bigger picture.<br />
<br />
The other characters also seem to grow worse in personality. In the beginning, they at least had some &quot;character&quot; to them to individualize their interactions with the MC. But eventually they all turn into the same, smiling, copy paste member of the MC&#039;s harem, a harem of love, sunshine, and friendship. Conflicts are resolved too easily and with little consequence. There are no villains. It&#039;s as hei-wa as can be. Even darker or emotionally disturbing situations are swiftly cut short with rainbows and unicorns. It&#039;s a very child-like naive view of the world devoid of any realism. Yes the show is meant for children, but it doesn&#039;t seem to aspire beyond that, even in subtext.<br />
<br />
And the mechanic where her chronic illness constantly leaves her debilitated is extremely overdone. Quite literally half the screentime is of her fainting or feverish in bed. It becomes burdensome very quickly in advancing the already slow plot. Her development of new ideas and inventions frequently hits artificially created snags that are very poorly conceived and juvenile. She tries to dry some stone tablets out in the forest but is too dumb to take them with her or cover them when it rains. The other kids jumping on said tablets and ruining them out of nowhere is also highly manufactured. And the dumbest by far is when she goes out to carve plaques out of wood to write on, but leaves them stacked next to the firewood in her house. Half her house is literally shelves and shelves of nothing but firewood, and she nonchalantly just places them among the many piles. Her mother burns them of course, and the MC literally dies from the shock. It&#039;s supposed to be a pivotal moment in the story when she learns about how her fever can immediately consume her if her spirit and resolve to live falters, but it&#039;s brought upon by something ridiculously stupid and the dramatic reaction being equally as stupid.<br />
<br />
The slice of life stories get more and more ridiculous and contrived as the narrative progresses. Even as the MC goes on to do grander things and solves larger problems, the way she conducts herself and how they are resolved get dumber and dumber, as does the world building. Later in the show she randomly decides to join a church priesthood because she wants to read the books in their small library, knowing absolutely nothing about the religion of the church or the ramifications of being a member. The church she is a part of apparently has sex slaves, locks children up like puppy mills in dark basements, uses trickle down economics for food distribution, and somehow expects the people there to survive and become highly coveted and educated servants of nobility that fetch a high price, all while being a house of worship where not a single person is actually pious, while also harboring spoiled nobility that conflicts with the whole notion of asceticism. Two problem children in particular that become the MC&#039;s &quot;retainers&quot; are so bratty it&#039;s incredulous they were supposedly starving skin and bone just a few months prior with zero interaction with the outside world.<br />
<br />
And ultimately the kicker that made me drop the show was when the plotline involving the MC&#039;s close friend, and his family&#039;s disapproval of his merchant apprenticeship, finally stopped dragging on and came to a line snapping conclusion. The premise was already terrible to begin with. This close friend comes from a family of craftsmen who make things. He wants to become a merchant, who sells things. In literally any culture imaginable, these two professions would have a symbiotic relationship. But for some unfathomable reason, his family objects to him becoming a merchant. No concrete reason is given. The disagreement comes to a head and the MC butts in to mediate an intervention. The poor and ill-bred parents, as smug and self-assured as can be, even though they can barely feed their own children or understand the simple concept of money for basic survival, cannot give a single credible reason for objecting to their son becoming a merchant, or even complete a coherent sentence for that matter. Yet somehow the case is resolved by the son apologizing, at his father&#039;s command, and everyone smiling and trotting merrily out the door in dance and song. This is somehow also made out to be a life lesson or &quot;moral of the day&quot; that the MC is taught, the moral being she should not interject and instead hear both sides out, even if one side is completely toothless and irredeemable. I don&#039;t know what they are trying to teach kids these days but it definitely isn&#039;t how to reason or make any sound judgment. In fact, we should praise the irrational, the nonsensical, and the ugly, as long as they scream the loudest and make the biggest scene, much like anime ratings and hype on the internet.

    &quot;Ascendance Of A Bookworm&quot; had a plan - combine the isekai and slice of life genres to make something unique. Unfortunately it throws the strengths of these genres out of the window and leaves us something rather bland.<br />
<br />
Slices of life are not supposed to be boring - they entertain through the use of interesting characters and good charisma between them. This is where &quot;Ascendance Of A Bookworm&quot; disappoints the most. Every character is not much more than a trope and the main cast is extremely limited. I would go as far as to say that Myne is the only &#039;main&#039; character (pun intended) and everyone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338254">
        else exists in relation to her. Very often slices of life have a wide range of characters who operate equally in the foreground to give a wider approach to the story. There&#039;s nothing wrong with not doing that, but Myne on her own doesn&#039;t deliver an enticing narrative.<br />
<br />
In terms of interactions between characters, the relations between them are extremely static. The anime ends with everyone feeling pretty much the same about each other. Without getting into spoilers, there is a three episode arc, when the relationship between two protagonists gets a bit sour, and it is probably the most exciting part of the story. Unfortunately, the whole thing is quickly resolved and forgotten, without any bearing on the future relationship.<br />
<br />
Story wise, &quot;Ascendance Of A Bookworm&quot; brings some interesting premises - a girl from the modern world is brought to a fantasy one with medieval technology levels. Unfortunately the story doesn&#039;t do anything interesting with them other than justifying Myne&#039;s love for books. If you hoped for &quot;Dr. Stone&quot; levels of using forbidden knowledge, then you&#039;re going to be disappointed. Clearly, this is not the focus of the anime, but then the question arises: &quot;What is?&quot; and the answer seems to be &quot;Myne&quot;. The problem here is simple - Myne is not a particularly interesting character. No tragic past we get to explore, no moral qualms, no great ambitions, no hidden talents. Just &quot;want book&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, the review wouldn&#039;t be complete without mentioning the last sin this anime partakes in. The one thing that has turned this anime from &quot;meh&quot; to bad for me. I have left the worst for last.<br />
<br />
Quite often &quot;Ascendance Of A Bookworm&quot; tries to have heartfelt moments. A common scene looks something like this - Character A does something for B, B looks in shock and smiles at A, surprised that he would do something so honorable. How touching, I&#039;m going to cry. This exact cliche is repeated so many times here, I have been conditioned to cringe as soon as I see it coming. It is second only to my cringe when every boy starts blushing and crying when getting complimented. &quot;Ascendance Of A Bookworm&quot; reaches for cliches quite often, which is simply painful to watch at times.

    If you don&#039;t like Business Studies, then Myne would prove you wrong with her inventions and her intellectual brain she brought to an unfamiliar world! You can hate the isekai genre all you want. But Ascendance of a Bookworm will surely imprint a question mark above your head and make you think otherwise. <br />
<br />
Ascendance of a Bookworm is the closest thing we&#039;ll get for another season of Spice and Wolf. And of course, the closest thing we&#039;ll get for an isekai that doesn&#039;t actually suck. <br />
<br />
Despite of the fact that Ascendance of a Bookworm&#039;s MAL thumbnail looks like some kind of rip-off of Kenja no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327262">
        Mago&#039;s MAL thumbnail. Giving the first bad impression of &quot;Wise Man&#039;s Loli&quot;. Ascendance of a Bookworm doesn&#039;t have a single trace of the MMORPG trash unlike the majority of other isekai shows out there. Instead, the anime is pretty much just about a blue-haired loli with big brain being transported to another world and she uses her big brain to create inventions and make easy cash. <br />
<br />
Very chill. Very entertaining. Probably the best isekai I&#039;ve ever seen so far. This anime is no McDonald&#039;s. It is a fine Kobe beef topped with caviar, gold and truffle. An utter masterpiece. <br />
<br />
( Recommended to everyone so long as you don&#039;t use Myne as a fap material ) <br />

    Welcome to my review of Honzuki no Gekokujou: Shisho ni Naru Tame ni wa Shudan wo Erandeiraremasen! This review contains minor spoilers!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The story are the biggest problem in my meaning!! It have an awful start and just keep failing as it moves along!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Motosu Urano is a Liberian and write books for children. She lives in a distant world and she love books in all their forms!! Fiction to mathematics philosophy and everything in between.She is the definition of a bookworm and literature Is her love in life!!And she surrounded herself with books!! But the books was not happy at all!! They where angry and took

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325660">
        their revenge on the tyrant who imprison them!!! What? Really? Well all the fucking information I got here is &quot; But then&quot; followed by an ugly animation on falling books!! Then the text &quot; On the verge of death I uttered a silent prayer&quot;,,, Thank you for all the details!! We are not even 3 minutes in and already in the shit creek without a paddle!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As I said the story have big problems and overall are confusing and contradicting itself constantly!! And make no sense at all!! Even the beginning is weird and fails with the logic!! The head priest is holding a stick and saying!! Myne is the only one who have used this to tie her hair!! It&#039;s a hairpin you idiot!! People have been using them for along time!! For well tie their hair!! But you can also take it and stick it up you damn ass if you wish!! You fucking imbecile! Then the head priest transfer Myne to another world!!! By giving her some vine!!!,,That scene made me feel really uncomfortable to be honest!! She is transferred to the body of the young girl Myne! Who live with a poor family around the middle ages!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This anime more the less revolves around Myne hunt for more literature! But her search for those precious books comes to a screeching halt, Because of her family&#039;s low social status! Books was a luxury item back then!! Made for kings and nobles,, Not for the common folks or simple guardsman who can&#039;t even read!! She needs to find other means and decide to try to make books herself! Witch Is not an easy task!! And she struggle to find a way to solve her problems!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It tries so hard to be realistic but fails miserably!! It&#039;s like a history lesson that try to teach you about the medieval period, but it have no knowledge about how things worked back then!! Like when the poor hungry street children are learning how to read!! They should be send to the coal mine where they belong!! YURI-CRUSADER!!! What are you saying?? Those are children!!!!! Well yes!! But still they call it the dark-ages for a fucking reason!! Nobles and rich people learned how to read not the common folk! They send them to the mines where their stupid poor asses belongs!! And commoners marrying rich people? It&#039;s all over the place!! Please chose a tone and stick with it!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When you think you have passed the worst bit!! The animation hits you in the face like a shovel!! It&#039;s ugly as hell!! Its dull grey and so boring!! It&#039;s so lifeless and unattractive!! The food the characters everything looks tasteless!! I eat with my eyes and love anime because how tasty and delicious it looks but this is unappetising foulness! Even the females are boring and uninteresting!! They look like zombies!! Usually I go nuts for anime girls!! I collect waifus and going to catch them all!! But here they are just a grey lifeless mess!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The sound is acutely ok the voice actors does a decent job!! No bigger problem here!! Noting to remember fondly!! But in this hellhole Is the only positive aspect!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The characters are as exacting as the animation!! The Father is overly jealous annoying and loud!! The mother is dull and so are the rest of the characters!! They are very shallow no form of development in any meaning!! The street children don&#039;t do much to add something! Like the rest it&#039;s just a waste of time!! Noting to love or cherish here!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The are no enjoyment to be found,, Its only boredom! Everything from the story to the characters!! It takes more time to explain how to make a fucking basket then to go in to details about the main character!! The lack of information makes the ordeal very confusing!! But the non important aspect get a lot of time!!! Everything to goddamn fucking baskets, how to dry clay!!And for gods sake it sure take its time to explain how to make wooden panels!!! And the rest of the time goes to Myne being displeased angry or crying!! Well I was crying too and wonder what the fuck I&#039;m doing with my life!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have no problem with slow anime&#039;s! The problem is not the lack of action in the meaning! Its more how it telling the story and how the characters are being portrait!! I watch plenty of anime with no violence or action in that manner!! But they are warm and comfortable with lovable characters!! This is a grey lump of emptiness a void!! And are as giving as starring at an empty concrete wall!! That have no soul!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So the big question here is, Do YOU wanna watch this anime? No,, You don&#039;t!! Take my advice and run and never look back!! Or better go and read a fucking book about how to make a basket!! That is way more productive than to waste your life by watching this filth!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    Hooray! this bookworm is getting another season, truly ascending in the rankings. Jokes aside, I am quite glad this show is getting more seasons because this was probably the most under watched show this season that isn’t a sequel. Of all the Isekai this season, this one is definitely the only must watch I have seen. I highly recommend checking this out and giving it the 3 episode try since the first episode is really boring but it picks up quick.<br />

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
<br />
The main character is named Maine or Urano in her past life, she’s a frail blue haired child who just really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324774">
        loves books, so much so that the show is literally titled ascendance of a bookworm. Urano dies tragically in an ironic manner when a shelve of books, the thing she loves most, falls on her during an earthquake. After this she is reborn in the body of Maine a frail girl who lays in bed all day. It takes a while for Maine to realize that she’s in another world and that this world explicitly only has books for the nobility and that her commoner family will never be able to own one. Not one to let trivialities like wealth or class stop her, Maine becomes determined to make her own books. A lot of the story focuses around Maine getting healthier and figuring out ways to make books and bring some other inventions from her world to her new world which appears to be set in the 1500s. The crafting Maine does involve a lot of trial and error think Dr Stone except Maine cannot pull cellphones and gunpowder out her ass and actually has to put in immense effort only to fail multiple times. This however is why the show is so fun, the audience really gets to feel for the struggles of Maine, she fails so much, and every success feels like a great victory that we can empathize with and share in her joy. Along the way Maine befriends other kids such as Lutz, partners with merchants, and bonds with her new family. Although she fails a lot the show eventually gets to a point where she has achieved paper and she even has plans for the future. Maine’s journey to spreading literature in the new world has just begun and I look forward to seeing more of her work in the upcoming season.<br />
<br />
There is some conflict in the story, specifically the disease mine has which is the primary antagonist. Maine has to overcome the disease, so she doesn’t get killed in the new world however it appears to be incurable, don’t let the relaxed atmosphere fool you, this show definitely has its exciting and tense moments. Overall the story is enjoyable and is one of the best SOL isekai series out there.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
<br />
The art style is very basic, and the show also has very basic animation overall, this series doesn’t really have particularly good art. However, this isn’t really a big deal, there are no flashy fights, or fantastic scenery within this show that require high production values. The easygoing art in fact actually adds to the chill atmosphere and the character designs are still pretty solid, the art style really conveys the old-fashioned world the character lives in and captures the setting perfectly. I am definitely also a huge fan of the hair design and the design of Maine’s handicrafts which are fairly beautiful and make the audience understand why the nobility would be interested in having them to stand out.<br />
<br />
The sound: 7<br />
<br />
Nothing really special, but it is very relaxing. If you want to watch a show where you can fall asleep listening to the soundtrack, this is definitely the right series. Get comfy and listen to the ED at night it will definitely help you unwind.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
<br />
Maine and Lutz are the 2 real main characters, but the entire cast is quite colorful, and I think they were all decently developed. The mom and older sister, Maine’s new family, are great family members who support Maine and take care of her when she is sick, they also appreciate how much Maine tries at getting better and eventually even help her with her work when they realize how useful she is. The father dotes on his daughter and gets jealous in a funny way whenever Maine gives any praise to men who are not him, it would normally be creepy, but this show does it in a way that can be played off as comedy and the father himself is a great guy. As far as the other townspeople go, the kids besides Lutz are not very important but they play a role as well with helping Maine with labor and Maine helps tutor some kids. The merchant comes a bit later and begins teaching them how to integrate with the upper class and become successful at business. The characters were all fairly lively and there was great development between the 2 main characters so far so overall the cast was strong.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
<br />
This was definitely a fun show and worth watching, although the enjoyment level did not quite exceed an 8 due to very stiff competition this season, it was certainly the most interesting isekai this season and I looked forward to watching it more than the bigger name isekai shows like cautious hero.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
I give this show an 8, I was going to give a 7 since its around the level of quality of a 7 show, but the scene when Maine unleashes her mana was so satisfying that it raised the show by an entire point. This show is a definite watch if you are looking for a good SOL isekai series where the character isn’t stupid overpowered or always suffering and never having a good time, Ascendance of a Bookworm is a wholesome balanced isekai, a rarity these days.

       The isekai genre in recent years has done exceedingly well, we look at the more popular ones like Rezero, No game no life, konosubarashi etc. Being mindful of the fact that none of these animes are not typically what you&#039;d call &quot;happy go lucky&quot; animes in a sense that they don&#039;t give the audience a feeling of infancy...Honestly i have nothing against making an isekai into a slice of life, well i didn&#039;t at first. Honzuki no Gekokujou is one of those anime types that you see on forum sites, become intrigued by positive reviews an then go on to stream the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340544">
        entire season only for you to end up regretting it.<br />
   <br />
((Before I continue, this review is for those who have watched the anime but if you haven&#039;t and still need better clarity then you&#039;ve come to the right place.))<br />
<br />
     I mean common, enough with your over ambiguous nonsense which raves on and on with large words about how this and that makes you happy and positive and all that other self indulgent nonsense, people need actual honest reviews stop spouting crap. I&#039;d like to digress into the overall scheme of things, the anime in question(not bothered with typing the name throughout my review)basically tells the story of a possibly demented twenty something year old who died by the hands of the one thing she loved the most, books...THE IRONY!!!. She makes her dying wish to once again be able to read books in her next life too and seemingly enough she awakens, as a 5 year with an unknown magical illness. You all already know how it goes so I&#039;ll give it to you quick and simple.<br />
   It&#039;s normal to be obsessed with obtaining knowledge. Infact, I&#039;m sort of a nerd myself(full blown otaku rage mode) but it is in all sense very psychotic, eerie and downright dimwitted to like Books...No no hear me out, BOOKS!!. OH and not just what&#039;s inside the Enclosing, the paper, the very ink used to write the text, that my dear friends is what seems to interest the protagonist. This may seem like me raging over what you may believe to be silly humor thrown to us on context. Well that&#039;s partially right you&#039;d at first see it as so but then it gets annoying the more they tend to repeat this same gag of her throwing a fit every time she sees what may appear to be leather covering a thin sheets of paper.<br />
   Furthermore, I would like to move on to the intellectual capabilities of most of the characters in this anime. I watched the first three episodes an i had no complaints, I had honestly believed nothing would go wrong but i neglected a crucial tiny detail. I didn&#039;t want that to bother me, I&#039;d like to start off with two concepts to generalize on: 1. Protagonist&#039;s self indulgence 2. Recklessness in the anime.<br />
1. Turns out the protagonist, in all her wisdom and what was made out to be broadened knowledge, could only make stuff they basically teach middleschoolers in home econ classes...Weaved baskets, shampoo, hair ornaments. The paper manufacture was the only thing keeping me alive through all that, but too make it more annoying they had to focus a lot of unnecessarry attention towards all that pointless nonsense. I&#039;m not trying to say i was expecting some doctor stone type but it would have been better if she came up with a little more advanced items but not the ones that can leave her bedridden for days, yes I am aware she can&#039;t do much cause of illness<br />
2. So apparently in the era the anime is set in, adults are no wiser than kids who haven&#039;t reached double digits. Why in a person&#039;s right mind waste a ton of resources just because a kid puts an ornament in her, hair applies shampoo and says she can manufacture a revolutionary product and don&#039;t give me that in isekai anything is possible crap, we&#039;re dealing with slice of life anime here too. <br />
     <br />
    The Art and Sound of this anime are the only aspects of it I would consider giving a passing grade. Everything else would have to file a complaint to my retinas.<br />
<br />
    Lastly I&#039;d like to cease my soon ending rage by adding this to the fold. Just because she&#039;s cute and most male otaku are lolicons, that doesn&#039;t mean she can just make a cute face and get away with whatever flimsy excuse for a gag joke they could come up with.<br />
  I will be very honest it&#039;s hard to say what demographic of otaku i&#039;d recommend this anime to cause it&#039;s a migraine enhance, i&#039;d possible recommend it to kids below 10 or girls who just recently started watching anime. To break it short Honzuki no gekokujou is a poorly scripted, dissatisfying and mediocre(at best) isekai brought to us in 2019.<br />
  I said before that this review is for those who have already watched the anime but if you haven&#039;t and are still curious eve though i recommend not to, stream or download the first three episodes.

    Information and Knowledge are the most valuable things to exist in this world if you can utilize them properly.This what I experienced til now watching this anime.<br />
Even though it&#039;s similar to other Isekai anime it&#039;s also not.The main character is named Maine who had unquenchable thirst for knowledge in her previous life.Thus she was inclined to reading books as much as she could. Her affection towards books was so much that even when she was dying her only desire was to get to read books on her next reincarnation.<br />
This is the part where this anime stands out from other Isekai. She was blessed with the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323677">
        knowledge from her previous life but not with luck. She becomes a normal girl living in a normal household where books are so rare that there are people who doesn&#039;t even know what a book is. She is in no way or means overpowered or lucky. She has to battle out with herself and the reality to reach the end of her dream. To be able to read books. Ascendance of a bookworm accurately illustrates how reality works. The story progresses at a healthy pace. You won&#039;t feel bored,you won&#039;t feel rushed. You will feel her pain. You will feel her efforts to thrive towards her goal. If you are a person who likes fantasy of living a life in another world also the most humane progress of a character you will love this anime 100%.

    This show is pretty awful. There&#039;s major issues in every part of this production pipeline. From nonsensical sound fx almost appearing non-diajetic in nature half the time to the limited expression allotted to them from their limited budget being wasted on caricatures and presentation which detract from the overall theme and tone of the show. <br />
<br />
The overall narrative itself seems incredibly disjointed, ill-paced and not really thought out. The through-story ends up making the protagonist come off selfish and conceited, and the pacing and presentation only serves to double down on that conclusion.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s nothing good to say about this show except that going insane while

    A lot of shows this season have the similar premise of &quot;Being sent into a primitive world with knowledge of modern technology and introducing the knowledge to your new world&quot; and this one is my favourite of them all, even beating Dr. Stone by a narrow margin.<br />
<br />
You have the usual isekai setup of someone dies and is sent to a new world where they have a hidden yet over powered ability which they can use to save the world from... EXCEPT YOU DON&#039;T! You follow a young woman who only ever dreamt of becoming a librarian because she loves reading and learning from books, when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325612">
        she finally achieves her dream she is killed by a falling book shelf, when she is sent to a new world her one and only plea to God is that she can be reborn in a world where she can read lots of good books, and as an answer to that prayer a heartless reincarnation system throws her into a world where books are not only a rare commodity but reading itself is a uncommon skill, especially for a young girl at the very bottom of the social ladder.<br />
<br />
But what about the usual special power that isekai protagonists get to make them overpowered with a lot of magic power or something and yeah, you&#039;re right, she&#039;s got one of those, except not really because magic is basically a curse in this world so what she gets is a severe debilitating illness with no known cure that saps away at her strength and stamina.<br />
<br />
Watch the story of a little girl who against all this adversity strives and struggles to achieve something so simple as a single book to read even if she has to make and write it herself. Follow along with her as she achieves so many small victories on her way to her goal and mourns the losses of her work as a cruel world destroys and impedes her progress at every step, but it is not the destruction of a little girl&#039;s work you see but instead a child who will get back up and try again no matter what.<br />
<br />
Her main successes are not from a big amazing display of power but instead come from her knowledge of home economics and her book-smarts, she gives us a great insight into how knowledge was written throughout the ages from wooden tablets to clay to papyrus and so on in her quest. and we find out that in a medieval society even knowing simple crafts like crochet and shampoo are astounding to people around her who have yet to discover it.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s great if you love the isekai genre and just as good if you don&#039;t, because this isn&#039;t your average isekai show.

however, her thirst desire to make a book. had giving her an idea to create a social impact from books. and she kept trying all of she could. to made a paper out. to become a book, <br />
<br />
a lot of things and challenge happened on her, such as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325049">
        reject, trust issue, and so on. <br />
<br />
its all what we felt, as a startup founder. building an idea, pitch it out. reject, repeat and so on. <br />
<br />
it&#039;s what everyone felt upon building something new. something that everyone thing impossible. until you are the one who can made it out. <br />
<br />
so do with Myne. <br />
<br />
so i&#039;m hugely recommend this anime to those who wants to find a motivation to create social impact. <br />
<br />
remember, Myne could. then why you couldnt?

    Someone give this girl some books lol.<br />
<br />
But seriously, it&#039;s a great lil anime here, and an interesting tale on reincarnation. Following a young girl in Maine and her quest to explore her new life and her quest to get a book. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s quite amazing how Maine is portrayed also. I honestly feel like she could be a secret genius with hos she acts haha. But that just drags my interest more with what else she&#039;ll learn and do in this new place she&#039;s in.<br />
<br />
Speaking of such. It&#039;s quite a nice place. Seems very peaceful and well worked. A good lil place to live in my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321150">
        book. So where it&#039;s set is good on the eyes too.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a nice and peaceful anime all together really. Though the interest grows as you go on through the series. A definite watch.
