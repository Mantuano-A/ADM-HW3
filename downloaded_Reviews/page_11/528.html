    Golden Boy is about a twenty five year old guy, named Kintaro, who had completed all credits for college but dropped out right before graduation. He has decided to study all he can learn about life. He now specializes himself in day-dreaming, temporary part time jobs dealing with different areas of interest, and lets not forget, beautiful girls. Kintaro travels on his trusty pink bicycle, keeping notes about what he learns about life in his notebook, and living his life in the happiest of ways. Kintaro is a very caring guy, always trying to help out and learn new things from different people. Even though

          <span style="display: none;" id="review474">
        people try underestimate him during the series, they can only to be proved how great and determined Kintaro can be, aside of his naughty little toilet fetish. Each episode he gets a new job, finding himself in the difficult situations, and always managing to have a gorgeous woman involved in the story. <br />
<br />
Golden Boy is an anime with really no plot what so ever, but for some reason, it just made me love it even more. The whole time it just focuses on Kintaro going from temporary job to temporary job always finding these beautiful women, with different stories to each episode. I laughed so hard on this anime, I cried. The animation was good for the most part; it would go from extreme detail to kindergarten drawing, which just made it even more ridiculously funny. The one and only main character, being Kintaro, had great development; he was very expressive, emotional, determinative, crazily kind person with high value. You just couldn&amp;amp;rsquo;t help but love him, even with his toilet fetish and perverted ways. <br />
<br />
I loved the different aspects they show during the series about life and people always in the funniest of ways. The music was good, I loved the opening theme. I also loved how they show him traveling on his bicycle in the opening, I don&amp;amp;rsquo;t know why, and I can&amp;amp;rsquo;t really tell you why, but I just loved it. The English dub version was pretty good, so I would say you could watch it subbed or dubbed. I think in the English dub, his voice talent expressed him better, and just matched his personality better. <br />
<br />
The sense of humor is very sexual and perverted, which can be offensive to the people who don&amp;amp;rsquo;t find that sense of humor appropriate. I personally find implication of this type of comical humor hilarious. <br />
<br />
I think if you have a perverted sense of humor, you will really love this anime. It has brief nudity, not really that it has a lot of sex, or nudity, but the strong sexual humor taints this anime!!! Golden Boy is for the mature audience, eighteen and older. Even though this is a mature anime, it will bring tears to your eyes it is so comical. I would say, if you like Golden Boy, I would also recommend you to take the time and watch GTO, Great Teacher Onizuka, which is some what on the same level of humor, and reminded me a lot of each other.<br />

    Golden Boy anime review by realanimefan.<br />
<br />
First of all, you have to be a little open minded if you want to fully enjoy this story. Second be prepared for some perverted moments. Third, if you\&#039;ve overcome the first two get ready to laugh your butt OFF!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Guys might enjoy this series a lot more than women would, and i being a guy of course enjoyed, no loved this anime series. I found it hilarous and entertaining. The main character Kintaro Oe is one of my favorite anime guys of all time, he seems to be able to say or do the things that all guys think or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review513">
        do and like most guys that live, he\&#039;s clueless, but some how everything works out for him in the end no matter what he does which is what all guys really would like to screw up fix it and make your self look good, while all the girls fall madly in love with him! The old time theroy of Japenes is much better than English is almost always correct accept for this anime me having seen both japenese and english have to say the english is way better and even funnier, they were able to capture Kintaro\&#039;s personality so much better in Englsh than in Japenese so I suggest watching thsi in English you won\&#039;t be disapointed I promise! I only wished they made more anime series like this. The one thing that really peterbed me beyond madness was the fact that they only have 6 episodes and trust me you want more, this series leaves at a wanting state. Overall I would suggest this series to anyone even girls who can deal with some perverted moments!

    &quot;Kintaro Ooe - age 25. He withdrew from Tokyo University law school, but only after he&#039;d completed all the requirements for graduation. Ever since, he&#039;s traveled the highways and byways of Japan, trying out new jobs and positions and learning about life to the fullest. Striving ahead on his bicycle, the Mikazuki-5, he continues forward, seeking his destiny. And who knows? perhaps he&#039;s destined to save the Japanese animation industry, or even the world! Or maybe not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, that was educational. <br />
<br />
Kintaro Ooe- Goofy, clumsy, idiot, complete moron, incorrigible pervert, and endlessly entertaining protagonist. You know, Kintaro sounds a lot like きんたま, or kintama- which means

          <span style="display: none;" id="review228523">
        BALLS! And boy, does the Golden Boy ever have a pair of big brass balls. (He also eats the booty like groceries) This is a story about a man that pulls hoes wherever he goes, leaves a trail of wet panties behind, and only calls back once- when he needs the help of the whole harem!<br />
He is... the Golden Boy!<br />
<br />
Prepare your lungs, because the laffs coming are going to destroy them like 40 years of cigarette smoking in deep space. <br />
<br />
See, what makes Golden Boy so great is the blend of juvenile, irreverent sexual comedy that totally appeals to your inner middle schooler self, combined with this lovable goon of a main character that you just can&#039;t help but guffaw at. Kintaro is such a klutz and moron that there&#039;s no possible way he can screw anything else up harder than he does- ruining software development, animation, food, you name it, but the idiot savant has another facet to him- he&#039;s genuinely interested in helping the ladies that he&#039;s smitten with at first sight. His awkward, goofy, spoony self is always getting him into trouble with whatever part time job he manages to ingratiate himself into before screwing everything up... but, like the moments of brilliance that Patrick Starr occasionally shows that cover up his asininity, Kintaro always manages to save the day, fix everything up, and swerve on them hoes! <br />
<br />
The episodic setup of Golden Boy is perfect for the comedy that they&#039;re selling, and it&#039;s even self aware at times- which takes it to the next level. The basic idea is that Kintaro gets a new part time job in a different city, runs into a hot chick, and does his best to impress her, while being an enormously clumsy idiot that eventually lands him fired or on the run... but he always saves the day and fixes everything, because, after all... he&#039;s the Golden Boy.<br />
That&#039;s right- despite his intense perversion and fetishes (every episode, you just know that toilet worship is right around the corner, and it gets funnier every time), he&#039;s a selfless and helpful person at heart- and never takes advantage of the women who throw themselves at him through some circumstance- whether he&#039;s on the run, dippin out, or just not there- he ends up building a true harem, and all the ladies are after that D. This all leads up to the ending, where they really pull the rug out from under the viewer with how you expect Kintaro to go after the girl-of-the-episode, but it turns out entirely differently, and with hilarious results. <br />
<br />
As a friend of mine here said, &quot;Golden Boy predicted the fetishes of the 21st century with total accuracy tho&quot;. And he&#039;s right. At times, Golden Boy almost reaches into the hentai realm, but quickly falls off a cliff, and into the next dimension with some ludicrous scenarios that are so off the wall batshit crazy that you can&#039;t help but fall out of your chair gasping for air.  <br />
<br />
The people behind the show, studio APPP and Tatsuya Egawa (who even fictionalizes himself in the anime (trademark of his) in a ridiculous caricature of himself) are also a bit of an interesting history tidbit. APPP made only a very small handful of anime (were mostly auxiliary producers for other shows), including the old school Jojo OVAs, Roujin Z, and Now and Then, Here and There, but they did have one real, honest to goodness hit, and it has stood the test of time well (hey, something to be said for going out on top). Tatsuya Egawa, the writer and illustrator of the Golden Boy manga, was also a college math professor before he turned to manga, and later, even directed several porno films. Safe to say the man has had an interesting career. <br />
<br />
Art-wise, Golden Boy looks solid for a mid-90s anime, but what really sets it apart is another trademark of Tatsuya Egawa- FREAKING INSANE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS! Anyone who&#039;s seen the show knows exactly what I mean- hyper detailed, grotesque, wacky, goofy, and zany are the myriad of faces- which only add to the hilarity. Perhaps Steven Hillenburg took a few cues from Egawa, because Spongebob makes EXCELLENT use of the grotesque/weird stillframe shots of extremely detailed closeups of the characters. <br />
<br />
Sexual comedies and toilet humor might not be the average viewer&#039;s fetish in their anime, so what would make anyone want to watch this show, anyway? It&#039;s old. It doesn&#039;t look like Akira or anything, and there are only 6 episodes, so what gives? <br />
<br />
The English dub. That&#039;s what. ADV had a number of impeccable dubs in their time, like Kanon 2006, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Grave of the Fireflies, but Golden Boy stands proudly among them as one of the best they ever did. <br />
<br />
The star of the show though, Doug Smith, who regrettably only ever did 3 other anime roles, absolutely slays at making Kintaro the most awkward, goofy, and raucous protagonist ever. He somehow brings out new levels of craziness and gonzo and the bizarre voice really gives the character life, and takes the breath out of your lungs in the form of near constant laughter... AND HE&#039;S ALWAYS SHOUTING! <br />
DAMN GOLDEN BOY IS A LOUD ANIME, BETWEEN ALL THE MOANING AND SCREAMING AND EVERYTHING, BUT HOLY COW, IS IT EVER GREAT! This is truly an anime classic- and is probably the absolute best example of a pure, non-disgusting wish fulfillment ecchi with actual humor that&#039;s ever been made. I&#039;ve been singing the praises of Golden Boy for about 911 words now, but lord help, I haven&#039;t laughed at an anime this hard in years. I don&#039;t think there was much better of a series for me to come back to after having not watched anything in months- and I can&#039;t recommend it enough. <br />
<br />
study study study study study study study study study study study study study study study study study study study study study study study study study!<br />
<br />
That was very educational.

    Goldenboy is an anime that, for some bizarre reason, seems to have a fairly large fanbase. Due to it&#039;s age, it is probably one of the first animes to really push the boundaries of ecchi while still being able to retain a fair rating. While it does succeed in providing mindless fanservice, the series lacks severely in story development as well as character design. The story is fairly nonexistent but is supposed to follow a wandering student through his encounter with beautiful women on his personal soul search. The setting itself isn&#039;t a bad idea, but the development in the anime itself is lackluster to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2081">
        say the least. The story doesn&#039;t progress in any fashion, but instead only seems to serve as a slap-job way to tie the different encounters together.<br />
<br />
The artwork in Goldenboy is well dated. Hard edges with old-school styled shading and lighting effects are similar to what you would find in an early 90&#039;s eroge (hentai game). The backgrounds are drawn in a sketchy fashion and not really appealing, but are suited to the characters themselves. The overabundance of black white fields for &amp;quot;shining&amp;quot; effects is a bit overdone, giving characters a very plastic looking feel. Even for an anime of it&#039;s age, the artwork is fairly poor amongst other animes of it&#039;s generation.<br />
<br />
The soundwork in the series is fair, but nothing spectacular. The opening theme is easily forgotten and usually skipped amongst DVD viewers. Background sound effects are placed where they should be while background music is left to a pretty laughable presentation.<br />
<br />
The characters are about what you would expect to find in any standard eroge. All are very flashy with large endowments with very little personality. The schoolgirl is flirty, the office women is hard-up, and others fit their genres well enough, but they&#039;re hardly memorable. Viewers will be taken from character to character so often that they&#039;ll hardly even remember a character&#039;s name, much less anything else. Development for each of these characters is pretty poor as well. The development for the protagonist is actually poor as well, despite following his personal adventures. They show that he smart, lucky, and good hearted despite his extreme perversions, but that&#039;s about it. No background information is shown, no purpose to his travel, or much else is given to allow viewers to relate to the character.<br />
<br />
The apparent fanbase for this series is more than likely the same that find enjoyment with Iketeru Futari. The fanservice is abundant and the series short enough to get through in a single sitting, but the development and characters themselves are fairly laughable in terms of presentation. The series itself just seems to focus more on ecchi idiocy than anything, and fails to deliver in any other sense. Sensible viewers will find a more enjoyable experience with series such as Love Hina or similar titles.

    Golden Boy<br />
Golden Boy is a great classic and i thought that i wouldn&#039;t like it for some reason, i didn&#039;t have high expectation for this to be a masterpiece but it isn&#039;t because is too short and at least should be like Kyo Kara Ore Wa with 10 eps. of 40 min. each, but because i really was hooked to this and never got bored i think it&#039;s a great anime overall.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
I think there&#039;s no story more than, Kintaro Oe left University before he graduated with all merits and being the best student, but he decided to study in the school of life, by working

          <span style="display: none;" id="review196714">
        in different work places and be good at it, he will stumble with sexy women across this jobs and they will fall in love with him after they see how of a great guy he is in every aspect despite being a pervert and he doesn&#039;t stay to see if he was good at the jobs because he always leaves before everyone sees he is a genious and leaves the girls falling for him (that lucky bastard, romancing with the toilets but not with the girls) and that&#039;s how it ends, every girl working together looking for him and i felt it was quick, needed more episodes, overall was great to see his story.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound<br />
Well it has an old school drawing but despite that it was very good for that time. The music was fitting the comedy parts and the VA was very good.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
Every character was outstanding, in the first ep. Kintaro gives you the impression that he&#039;s a full pervert, selfish and dumb and you think that he will mess up everything, but at the end of that ep. seeing what he did, i was impressed and almost made me cry of proud for him, he&#039;s an amazing character despite his &#039;&#039;love&#039;&#039;  for the toilets and i consider him a favorite character, all the girls were great but the ones that i wanted to see always were The President of the company (she doesn&#039;t have a name) and Reiko (Why did he have to forget his reward, Reiko? why?) well the mix of everyone was outstanding.<br />
<br />
Enoyment<br />
Do i have to tell you this? this is really funny, the ecchi in ep. 1 and 5 are the best, you will really like Kintaro and his adventure through the school of life and you will be wanting more episodes, because only 6 eps. are not enough after watching it all. It was an outstanding enjoyment overall.

    Overall:<br />Honestly I really don&#039;t care about others opinions but this anime is the funniest of all from this millennium. It&#039;s only 6 short episodes and it still cracks anyone who sees it. My only wish is i&#039;d hoped they would have made more episodes but nevertheless this still rates one of my favorite. <br /><br />Animation:<br />what can i say? The animation is top notch and flawless. The characters look good, the art, presentation and everything else. <br /><br />Sound:<br />the music is not his strong points but the approach along the anime is enough to like. i liked the characters voices because they sound hentai or perverted. <br /><br />Story:<br />the story is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16">
        the support of this greatness. A college-dropout who entitled his life to study rather the world around him and naturally women is basically his world. the plot is really perverted and rated mature. The characters look very comical and the women aren&#039;t shy to show their skins...lol. I wouldn&#039;t say much about development rather than the main character occasionally finding new woman to study upon with.

    Overview: <br />
<br />
Do you enjoy really lowbrow comedy? Do you laugh from idiotic shows like Family Guy and find yourself embarassed that you actually laughed. I do! That is why I actually enjoyed Golden Boy, even if it kind of bruises my ego to admit it. Golden Boy came out in 1995 and never aired on TV here in the US, but the VHS hit US shelves and it was fairly well recieved by the few US anime critics at the time. Golden Boy is better known in Europe, where it was aired on MTV for some reason. This is a silly series, but it is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review165557">
        fun, frequently hilarious, and even somewhat insightful on occation.<br />
<br />
Story and characters: 5/10<br />

The main character is named Kentaro Oe and he...is odd. He went to Japan&#039;s most elite university and met all the requirements to graduate with a Law Degree, but he dropped out before graduating so he could travel the world as a free spirit and perform oddjobs. He is a shameless womanizer and pervert, but at the same time a gentleman that doesn&#039;t take advantage of the various girls he meets. The story is divided into several oddjobs that basically follow the same formula. Kentaro takes the job, everyone thinks he is inept, he proves he isn&#039;t inept, a girl that initially disliked him falls for him, he rides off and leaves the girl wishing she had slept with him. The end. Although the plot is FAR from what I would consider good, it is funny and the series actually uses its predictability to comedic advantage. The viewer knows that certain jokes are coming and it somehow makes it funnier when they finally happen. For example, Kentaro is shown worshipping a recently used toilet in EVERY episode! You just know it is going to happen, much like Kenny dying on South Park.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
<br />
The art is actually pretty good for a mid 1990s anime. It looked much better than most of its contemporaries and it has aged well.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
<br />
The reason you watch a comedy is to laugh, and Golden Boy delivers the laughs! I would actually recommend the English Dub over the original Japanese on this one. I thought the English dub captured the goofiness of Kentaro&#039;s character better for some reason. I am aware that MTV Europe did a Russian dub, but I have never heard it and I can&#039;t say if it was good or not. This probably isn&#039;t going to be your favorite anime of all time, but you will have a good time! This anime knows exactly what it wants to be and it executes very well!<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10<br />
<br />
I am not saying that Golden Boy is a great masterpiece, but it is a fun series that will provide some laughs to those of us that like dumb humor. It is a shame that this series isn&#039;t better known. I guess part of that is how old it is, but it has aged well and feels like it could have been made last year. I would give this one a try, even if it is just the first episode or 2. You will know after the first episode if this is your cup of tea or not, because the episodes are all quite similar.

    Golden Boy revolves around 25-year-old Kintaro Oe. Kintaro is a freeter. In case you&#039;re like me and have no idea what that means, he basically travels all over Japan on his trusty bike and takes various odd jobs to survive.<br />
Kintaro is one of the smartest, most resourceful guys you&#039;ll ever meet, but you&#039;d never realize it by looking at him. He has a dopey voice, an over-eager attitude, and a perverted streak a mile long. All that belies his true self, however. He dropped out of Tokyo University before obtaining his law degree, even though he had already passed all the necessary classes. His desire

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29441">
        to learn more about the world around him prompts his current free-roaming lifestyle. He constantly writes what he learns in his notebook. This could be useful information for the episode&#039;s relevant skill, perverted sketches of the women around him, or odd bits of information (ex. &quot;The human head cannot turn 360 degrees.&quot;). Also, he has a fetish for toilets.<br />
<br />
The series is broken up into six OVA episodes. A typical episode revolves around Kintaro working a new job in a new environment, be it as a janitor for a software design company, a campaign worker for a mayoral candidate, or delivery guy for an animation studio. He will soon meet his love interest for the episode and inevitably alienate himself from them somehow. Often, his uncontrollable lust leads to some awkward circumstance resulting in his getting fired. However, by episode&#039;s end he will have proven his worth to the girl and win her heart. Oddly enough, he never takes advantage of any of these women, despite the fact that sex is sometimes the driving force of the episode (episode 6). The narrator claims that Kintaro may one day save the world. Don&#039;t expect anything like that. This is a slice-of-life anime at best.<br />
<br />
The animation is good. Very 90s, but good. I prefer that style, really. The animation is pretty fluid, especially in the opening sequence. The opening sequence is Akira-level, easy. The girls are invariably pretty hot, which is good considering the series heavily sex-based humor. Also, the EXTREMELY over-the-top facial expressions are a selling point for the series. Kintaro&#039;s face can range from simple pretty-boy anime fare to an over-detailed, imposing style, to stuff you honestly have to see to understand.<br />
<br />
The humor is great. Base? Yes. Sexual? Very. Stupid? No. The writing never failed to entertain. Whether having Kintaro&#039;s boss discover him fantasizing over a toilet, him having the shit kicked out of him by Yakuza flunkies, seeing him be borderline molested, or watching him nearly drown (&quot;So! How do you like my swimmin&#039;?&quot;), the laughs keep coming. Kintaro&#039;s voice actor adds to the fun. He gives Kintaro an almost dopey voice that makes his excited, and often head-scratchingly odd, thoughts all the more hysterical. The voice acting (dub) is actually pretty exceptional. Don&#039;t let the horrible female VAs in the opening scene of Episode 1 fool you. The voices are natural, which is getting increasingly rare, and none of the acting seems forced. <br />
<br />
Some miscellaneous thoughts: The end theme, sung by what I can only guess are the Japanese VAs for the series&#039; girls, is one of those that I disliked at first, but eventually came to love. It grows on you. The girls sings well, and the song is fun and happy. I haven&#039;t heard a J-theme as bouncy since Excel Saga&#039;s op. Also, since the series offers six different pairings and none of them are established as canon, I want you to know I ship Kintaro and Chie from Episode 6.  Although my favorite girl is Naoko from Episode 2, Chie seems more suited to Kintaro.<br />
<br />
Finally, my scores.<br />
Animation: 8/10<br />
There&#039;s no plot. So, Writing: 7/10<br />
Music: 8/10<br />
Voice Acting: 6/10<br />
<br />
FINAL SCORE: 7/10<br />
<br />
EDIT: After watching it again, I decided that I was too lenient on the voice acting. Some of it is good, but it isn&#039;t superb. VA score lowered to 6.

    Golden Boy is one of those OVA series that, if you were watching anime in the 90s, you’d probably fondly remember. And for the most part, it holds up very well. This review will be talking about the English dub, so if you’re not a dub watcher, go check out another review. I should mention off the bat however that the English dub is actually really good. Doug Smith is hilarious as Kintaro in a way I can’t describe. I’d urge you to give the dub a go just to see if you’d like it, and if you don’t, go ahead and watch the original

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173953">
        Japanese.<br />

Golden Boy is an episodic show with only one constant and that is our main man Kintaro Oe. Apart from the last episode, you’ll never see any other character twice in the show. The show follows a simple formula. Kintaro finds a job at a new place. He tries his best to learn the ins and outs of the work. He gets into a bit of trouble. He ends up doing something that impresses the woman who had resented him for whatever he had done previously. Said woman falls in love with him, but by that time, it’s too late. He’s usually off to find his next job.<br />
<br />
I suppose the main draw of this show is the rather perverted sense of humour. There is a bit of nudity and sexual things happening in the show. How Golden Boy distinguishes itself from others of its ilk is that Kintaro is generally quite innocent. Yes, he’s perverted, but he never does anything to harm any of the women he’s attracted to and he genuinely wants to help them. This gets him into all sorts of trouble and I have to bring up Doug Smith again for providing a hilarious dub. The stuff he says is all sorts of ridiculous, but it’s the exaggerated delivery which brings the hilarity to a whole new level.<br />
<br />
The animation in Golden Boy is really damn good to be perfectly frank. There is a lot of fluid movement that looks pretty natural. It also has that charming 90s look with some of the character’s faces. Though speaking of faces, the women in this show are actually really attractive. A lot of the time in other shows, to know if a particular female is attractive or not, we’re told by other characters. I guess the same happens here, but you can tell off the bat because they really are. Generally speaking, the art is just solid all around. Environments and all aren&#039;t too important in this show, but they&#039;re certainly competent. In terms of soundtrack, I don’t think anything in particular stands out, but it’s not like we really need anything to in a comedy series.<br />
<br />
What really works in Golden Boy’s favour is that it is relatable, at least as a guy. Of course we’re not all going to sniff toilets that a hot girl has sat on, but as guys, it’s not always easy dealing with attractive girls. It’s not only that, but sometimes, the best of intentions might get you into some real trouble. Unfortunately, we’re not going to be able to attract girls in the way that Kintaro does, but I suppose Kintaro is kinda meant to be one of those characters that we aspire to be. He’s realistic enough, but he has just that little bit more oomph that makes his abilities just out of our reach. In this sense, he’s kinda like GTO’s Onizuka. His solutions aren’t always things we can do in real life, but damn is it entertaining to see ridiculous solutions put into practice in a realistic world.<br />
<br />
As a whole, Golden Boy is a solid product. At only 6 episodes, it’s not even going to waste much of your time even if you don’t like it. But for everyone else, especially guys out there, it’s a good way to spend an afternoon. Just make sure your parents aren’t watching your computer screen or can hear your speakers while you’re watching this show and you’ll be good!

    Story: Study, Study, Study!!! His name is Kintaro, and he likes to study. This OVA, like many others, is episodic, and at the end, it ties them all together in a very nice way. The consistent plot is about a man named Kintaro, who dropped out of Law School even after completing all of the necessary classes, has become a nomad and roams the world on his bicycle, in search of love and knowledge. And he finds it alright. Each episode starts good, and wraps itself up good, giving you a nice feeling. Although all the episodes follow fairly the same template, you won&#039;t find

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6379">
        yourself getting bored. The story is original, and when you finish the series, (which you may do all in one sitting) you will have a nice feeling inside.<br />
<br />
Art: For when it was made, this OVA has some very nice art. The backdrops and characters are detailed, and they can be compared to what GTO looks like. Very nice art, all the female characters are attractive (That&#039;s what really matters, right??!) and to top it all off, the titties are drawn well. Err... Yeah, I&#039;m not gonna jump around it, Golden Boy is a rather sexual series, though all done in good taste.<br />
<br />
Sound: Watch this dubbed. It is great. The man who does Kintaro&#039;s voice is an absolute genius, and will have you in tears with his antics. Other than that, the show is fairly good, with the voices fitting to the characters, and the background noises sound nice.<br />
<br />
Character: Although Kintaro is the only character that we see consistently throughout every episode, the the characters that are introduced episode-to-episode have a good amount of depth and good personalities. You can like them, and probably relate to at least one of them. Kintaro is what really keeps this series going though; he one of my favorite characters of all time. Sweet, fun-loving, eccentric, and loves to study. I cannot stress how much Kintaro loves to study. As I said before, the females are very attractive (who am I kidding? They are downright sexy), and they have nice tits too (sorry, sorry, but it is TRUE).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I enjoyed this series very much, and will probably re-watch it. This series is massively enjoyable, and I would say that if you don&#039;t like this series, you have no sense of humor, and are probably either: A) A cardboard box, or B) A toaster oven.<br />
<br />
Overall: A great series, I would highly recomend it to anybody, regardless if they like OVA&#039;s or comedies or not. I would say that it would be alright for a mature fifteen year old to watch this series, because it is sexual, and has one scene of female masturbation that isn&#039;t too graphic, but isn&#039;t appropriate for a younger audience. Oh, and if you were offended by my tittie references in this review, don&#039;t watch Golden Boy, because you will be disgusted out of your mind.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: Watch this series. Now.

    Let me start by saying: I am definitely not the correct target audience for this anime. I heard good things, however, and decided to give it a look.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story is about a 25 year old man called Kintaro and his adventures being a &#039;free spirit&#039; or a &#039;freeter&#039;, travelling across Japan, picking up odd-jobs and meeting lots of women who seem to fall for him along the way. Each episode follows a different job he picked up, and the antics that ensue. The premise is fine, and honestly feels like it could be enjoyable if it wasn&#039;t for the lackluster humor and characters.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
What can I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405901">
        say, I enjoy the art a lot. 90&#039;s anime almost always has an art style thats pleasing to the eye. I did find the women were drawn quite attractively, despite the emphasis put onto revealing clothing. The animation was overdone in a fantastic way, really cementing the quintessentially 90&#039;s vibe.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
I&#039;m a dub watcher, sue me. The dub was decent enough for the time, I suppose. Kintaro did sound quite a bit like someone trying their best to do a Fred Flinstone impression... and not doing very well. It was distracting but I can see how some people could ignore it. The music is memorable in it&#039;s own way, and I quite enjoyed the opening song. <br />
<br />
Character<br />
This is where I think the anime begins to take a turn for the worst. Kintaro is an obnoxious pervert, and very childish. He&#039;s a good guy at heart, and intelligent but the toilet humor and sexual energy is a bit too much for me. The women are okay, but they all seem to fall head-over-heels for this one perverted freak. If Kintaro was dialed back I think this anime would&#039;ve been much more enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
I honestly didn&#039;t enjoy this too much. I had some laughs, the swimming scene being very memorable, but most of the jokes fell flat for me. I considered dropping this anime a few times, and it&#039;s only 6 episodes long. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I can enjoy an ecchi anime now and then, but this one just didn&#039;t cut it.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
I do think Golden Boy could be enjoyable to a lot of people, and I&#039;m not shaming anyone who enjoyed it. If you&#039;re considering watching this show, I&#039;d recommend checking out the first episode and seeing if you enjoy it, since the rest of the show pretty much follows in it&#039;s footsteps.

Its in essence, an ecchi. However, I feel that the underlaying background story and characters of the show were very well written, just the ecchi got in the way a little too much. If Golden Boy was just Kintarou going from place to place and helping people without his sex drive constantly getting in the way I feel it could have been a much better series.<br />
<br />
Kintarou himself is a very interesting and great character. You expect most characters in ecchi anime like this one to fit in a specific role, dumb and honest, smart and sly, ect. At first Kintarou comes off

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3081">
        as the dumb honest type, who wants to try and prove himself in various fields to impress woman, but constantly fails, which he does do. But Kintarou is a very intellegent person, who seems to have the skill of learning things that take most people years to accomplish in a matter of weeks. Too bad in the end hes always trying to use those skills to impress a girl.<br />
<br />
...or is he? Kintarou always starts off with the seeming motivation to impress a female of choice, but if he does manage to get that girl to come around and like him, he inevitably runs away before any romance can develop. Which leads me to think all this &#039;impress the girls&#039; plot is just something Kintarou is trying to see how various woman react to various situations, something given his brains I could see him doing.<br />
<br />
Overall, the ecchi really got in the way of what could have been a great story, but its still worth at least one watch though IMO.

    One of the funniest shows of all time, Granted I am judging this by Anime Comedy Standards and not As a work of art. If I was judging it among history it would be somewhere in the middle of the top 100 anime shows of all time. But in terms of any Anime Comedy I&#039;ve seen this one is probably easily number one.<br />
<br />
Story: It&#039;s very simple Boy travels on Bike trying to learn new things, boy meets sexy babe he wants to get jiggy with, Boy pisses off Girl, Girl realizes that Boy was an absolute genius and demands that he take her sexually, except

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6740">
        then she realizes it&#039;s too late. For Six Episodes this formula is repeated, and to be honest there are some laugh out loud hilarious scenes: a scene involving Keitaro and a Toilet Water Shooter had me crying with laughter and the other scene that was really funny is when Keitaro accidently makes out with another guy. There are so many dirty gags in this story. But for some reason the sense of comedic timing is impeccable.<br />
<br />
Art: By Today&#039;s standards the art would be around a 5 but since this was an early show I&#039;m going to go easy on it and give it a 10, the animation tells the story here and that&#039;s what matters.<br />
<br />
Sound: Probably one of the funniest english dubs of all time. Doug Smith is actually not a professional voice-over actor he is actually a full time artist. Yet, he some how manages to turn this Role into Gold. Kintaro Oe was born to be played by Doug Smith and he demonstrates an incredible sense of timing. All the episodic characters are well played as well. But in all seriousness, Doug Smith owns this show.<br />
<br />
Character: Kintaro Oe is a fantastic character, he is very stereotypically male and does seem to be very very horny, but what I find funny is how well they incorporate his weakness into the humor of the story.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I really don&#039;t need to say more, I enjoyed this series Fully.<br />
<br />
Overall this show is probably without a doubt in the Top 3 in terms of anime comedies. I would think Chobits and another show are up there as well. But yes this should definitely be required watching for any serious Otaku.

    &quot;My name is Kintaro Oe. I&#039;m a freeter, a free spirit who specializes in temporary jobs. Right now I&#039;m working as a ....&quot;<br />
<br />
Golden Boy is a comedy-ecchi anime about a 25 year old boy who is a university dropout. He completed all the courses to get a degree but dropped out just before graduation. He wanders off in his Crescent Moon cycle and gets temporary jobs, odd jobs. And most of the times he screws up in his jobs anyhow for which he makes up later.<br />
<br />
Kintaro is also a pervert, not a typical one thou. He has a notebook and he write everything he sees.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review94233">
        His common dialogue is &quot;This is SO EDUCATIONAL.&quot;<br />
<br />
He always bumps into a beautiful girl and falls for her. The girl normally hates him first [or not] but Kintaro does something incredible to make the girls love him. But when they fall in love with him, he is long gone, wandering.<br />
<br />
Golden Boy has no real plot or anything but this is an awesome anime. This anime has the best combination of ecchi and comedy with some sexual humor and nudity. I wouldn&#039;t suggest this to anyone who are not at least 18. The anime is really funny, Kintaro&#039;s dialogues, his facial expressions, everything.<br />
<br />
The anime was created in 1995-96. But still you can&#039;t complain about the animation. The soundtrack is very good.<br />
<br />
This anime will make you laugh your ass off. I don&#039;t normally like ecchi-ness and fanservice in anime as it makes the anime stupid but in Golden Boy it was different. <br />
<br />
Lastly, it&#039;s a masterpiece, a very good comedy. <br />
I&#039;ll give this 6 episode OVA 10/10.

    Golden Boy is personally one of the most interesting and enjoyable anime there is. The concept is so simple yet so attractive. It is quite a shame that only 6 episodes were ever produced because i doubt that this anime could ever get boring. However, the ride is fun while it lasts. <br />
<br />
The story revolves around Kintaro, just your average ordinary guy. However, what attracts you the most is his utmost and utter dedication to his jobs and promises which are a part of every single episode in which he finds himself at a random job. Carrying around his little journal which he fills with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15033">
        what he learns. His energy and perverted nature as well as his occasional random boners towards his very sexy bosses will make you laugh. Other than his little fetish nature of hugging the toilet seats of his very sexy bosses, Kintaro is a very inspirational character. <br />
<br />
This anime could have easily been stretched beyond just 6 episodes because there are a limitless amount of jobs that he could have taken on but nonetheless, this is a great anime that everyone must check out.<br />

    Beneath the skirt of this raunchy comedy lies the undergarments of optimism and a tale of determination. Let us lift the skirt.<br />
<br />
Golden Boy is a six-episode ecchi series complete with gorgeous ladies, a surprisingly likable protagonist, episodic adventures with hilarious slapstick and toiler humor and is actually tamer than I expected. It follows Kentaro, a jobhopping, streetsmart dude who despite being an open pervert and having ill-timed bravado, has genuine heart of gold and helps those in need.<br />
<br />
Being ecchi done in the 90s, it is well-animated and its adult comedy was evergreen due to its simplicity and relatability. There is no sex scenes but lots

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410124">
        of sexy scenes and mild nudity but were done so much better than even legit hentais. Teenage dudes will have their hormones shake up in this most definitely. Beyond the titillation however was the fact that the protagonist does not commit atrocities to satisfy his carnal desires. If anything else, he is quick to sublimate his perversion into genuine kind acts because of he cares for the characters he comes across. In fact, the arguably sleaziest scene he was shown in was not even with a girl which i busted my ass laughing at. In short, it is American Pie but with class.<br />
<br />
Story was simple... Kentaro wants to get laid...meet girls and people she is with....he wants to get laid....raunchy stuff...resolves a problem... getting his just desserts. It is a series of side quests and without a resolution. Watch this for the delicious hot scenes and rambunctious sleazy humor and don&#039;t expect anything deep. For what it is, it is a masterpiece.<br />
<br />
Art is great for its time and even this age i find it well done. Ecchi scenes were, quoting the anime itself, the cream de resistance.<br />
<br />
Soundwise, there was nothing special in its OST. Dubbing however was absolute hilarious in English and probably the go-to version for western audience. No, I implore you to watch it in English by default.<br />
<br />
With that said, Golden Boy lives up to its name and a very enjoyable ecchi show. Short, sexy, sweet, and will do good for the tummy. <br />
<br />
Don&#039;t watch this with parents or any family member. <br />
DO NOT WATCH ON THE LIVING ROOM

    Golden Boy reminds me of the infamous shower scene of Hitchcock&#039;s Psycho; it has been often imitated but never duplicated. It&#039;s an anime that I believe set the standard long ago on how to put together an ecchi anime title capturing practically everything that goes on in the minds of horny men, and manages to be incredibly entertaining without being completely over the top offensive. Golden Boy follows the freeter Kintaro as he jumps from job to job; not at all because he&#039;s constantly fired, instead, he always feels it&#039;s time to move on and learn something new. <br />
<br />
When looking back on this title; I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202461">
        didn&#039;t realize how bad this thing could have been placing a lecher as the focus. Every job Kintaro lands finds him next to extremely beautiful women with all the right assets most of the time. He tries to learn everything about his job, perform at the highest level, all the while fighting back his sexual urges. He often thinks out loud what he would do and what he should do, in these situations that are not impossible for men to find themselves in. For example, he finds himself in a swimming race with a really hot instructor. While she&#039;s in the lead his focus is completely on her crotch with the dirtiest of thoughts, and there are plenty of situations like these with the second episode being a stand out, as Kintaro plays tutor to a young horny girl whom gets her kicks out of teasing men. <br />
<br />
One of the often stated flaws of this series is that Kintaro never truly develops, which is kind of true in a way. However, we get to know the other side to his personality in which he does have a heart of gold. This is what keeps the anime from sinking like a stone, and is the reason why plenty others of this type usually fail. Kintaro will go through hell to help anyone, and despite the predictable endings to some of these episodes; it&#039;s the trip to the end wondering what he&#039;s going to do that makes it worthwhile. There&#039;s also one theme that occurs which I found to be pretty interesting, and it&#039;s the message in regards to learning. Parents and to my experience a lot of teachers, forget that learning isn&#039;t something that should be aggressively forced, it should also be entertaining and stimulating as well to motivate the individuals into wanting to do it. <br />
<br />
Golden Boy can be and will be offensive to some, since there is plenty of fan service through crotch shots, nudity, and just plenty of sexual innuendo&#039;s. Thankfully, there are no serious hentai elements to be found, and everything is kept within the realm of good humor. My personal gripes would probably be the repetitive use of one joke, and the last two episodes are not as strong as the previous. Unlike many fans of the series; I&#039;m happy with the short number of episodes, because this series could have easily grown dull regurgitating the same material. <br />
<br />
The production values are pretty good with the character designs being the best thing the series has to offer visually. The women are drawn very curvy with loads of sex appeal, and Kintaro&#039;s overly exaggerated facial expressions can be hilarious. The camera work helps out especially when delivering the fan service. I enjoyed the voice work also, with the English dub outshining the seiyuu a great deal. <br />
<br />
Now is Golden Boy something for everyone? Well, I definitely recommend it to guys who love fan service in their anime. Those who prefer lots of graphic sex in their anime shades of Kite or Mezzo Forte should look elsewhere. For the girls, I know some who didn&#039;t have much of a problem with it, because they got to see the non-lecherous side of Kintaro. If you have a disdain for the content described, then perhaps avoiding it will be best for you. <br />
<br />
Highs: Funny ecchi comedy done right<br />
<br />
Lows: Content will put off some, loses some steam towards end

    So it is 2019 and this is a review for an anime that is now 24 yerars old....mmmm..... why bother? <br />
Me being relatively new to the wonderful wacky world of anime and manga, I somehow found this one via someone&#039;s list, and being a bit of an ecchi fan I decided to give it a go. <br />
Story: the premise of the story is ok, it&#039;s just that the mc&#039;s behaviour and the way he leaves the various jobs is just not reasonable in most cases.  Also, his obsession with hugging toilets really let the main character down a lot. The one redeeming feature was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321135">
        how it all tied together in the end.<br />
Art: The art isn&#039;t bad, I was actually expecting a lot worse. The few ecchi scenes were actually not bad at all, boobs bounced nicely where required to, etc. <br />
Sound was ...meh..... and his wacky laugh irritated the hell out of me, nevertheless I persevered.<br />
Character: as mentioned above, the Mc&#039;s behaviour in awkward situations really annoyed me, his laugh annoyed me - for someone who has apparently done all the studying to get a degree, he often behaves like a damn perverted middle-schooler. some of the sexy female chars were lovely, and you can clearly see who are the unimportant chars to the main story. Some parts are totally cringe-worthy.<br />
Enjoyment: I&#039;m only giving it a 4 (Decent) because of some of the positive points mentioned above, otherwise it would be dreadful, and it&#039;s also the reason I just give it an overall score of 4. If I think too much about the cringe-worthy parts I might be tempted to just give it a 2, so this is it.<br />
