    The story is basically battle royale but with animals. These people are infused with specific animal DNA resulting in them being able to turn into their animal forms. Okay not the best story wise but the fighting is what really drew me into this anime. Okay I would be lying if it was 100% the fighting, a large portion of it revolved around the amount of HEAVY fan-service in this anime. Which can always boot the enjoyment of an anime as well.<br />
<br />
The art and animation was really well done. LIDENFILMS has yet to disappoint me when it comes to high quality art and animation.<br />
<br />
The opening

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275778">
        and ending were so good. The ending was a good head banger/ running song and the op was really entertaining. The music during the show fit it perfectly as well A lot of heavy metal is a great thing when it came down to it.<br />
<br />
The characters were fantastic. Really i felt only one character did match their animals when it came to personality, each basically fit their characters perfectly.<br />
<br />
When it came to enjoyment I really loved it. The fights were better then most fights I have seen in DBZ, Naruto, Bleach etc. They were unpredictable and very well animated.<br />
<br />
Overall this was actually a decent anime to watch. I can see why the score would be swayed either high or low because of peoples tastes, but overall I think this show deserves a little more praise.

    Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I read the manga, i knew what i had to expect.<br />
And man, i wasn&#039;t dissapointed. This could be the best worst anime of 2018.<br />
I seriously was waiting for this anime, even though i knew it won&#039;t be something humanity wants to remember in the future.<br />
<br />
This show is utter trash and i love it.<br />
<br />
If you want to have a good time just watching boobs and people killing each other, then you are in for a hell of a ride.<br />
<br />
The Story is unimportant and just a framework for the explosive action and eroticism. <br />
<br />
The music rocks. I have to say, the music is really good, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275808">
        heavy metal tunes are awesome.<br />
<br />
The fights rock. You can see them actually fighting instead of talking for half an hour.<br />
<br />
And the anime is actually funny, i didn&#039;t expect that but i had to laugh really hard a lot of times.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the anime.<br />
<br />
The anime is good in its own way, and shouldn&#039;t be judged bad only because it doesn&#039;t suit your taste.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t expect anything great. Grab a beer, lean back and have fun :)<br />

    A violent battle among people who morph into animals, with lots of action and fanservice. &quot;That&#039;s what Killing Bites is&quot;<br />
<br />
The story begins when an average college student, Yuuya Nomoto, agrees to go pick up girls with his newly made acquaintances. Little did he know that by picking up they meant kidnapping and attempting a rape. Things don&#039;t go as planned, though, because Hitomi aka Ratel, the girl they try to mess with, turns out to be a real beast. That all leads to Nomoto getting mixed up in the world of therianthropes and their deadly fights. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s easy to understand what Killing Bites is like.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276029">
        Don&#039;t expect deep and thought provoking story from this show. It is still good at what it wants to be, though. The plot does progress throughout the show, some of the events I have found surprising and the anime was overally engaging and pretty exciting to watch. <br />
<br />
That is mostly because of fights which are well animated and interesting. The therianthropes&#039; moves correspond to each animal&#039;s actual abilities (which are explained during the educational scenes accompanied by some heavy music, a lovely combo). Thanks to that, every character&#039;s fighting style is different and the outcomes aren&#039;t always predictable. The show is also full of violence and blood, but it fits its nature and is something I&#039;ve never found unfitting in this case. Things can also get lewd during the battles but it&#039;s not the usual, glorified kind of lewd we most frequently see in ecchi shows. It&#039;s more brutal and won&#039;t be to everyone&#039;s liking.<br />
<br />
The characters are another good point of Killing Bites and aren&#039;t as shallow as one could expect. Each of them has their own past, reasons and ambitions. Some of the relationships might also get pretty complicated as shown in the last episode. I also like how each therianthrope&#039;s respective animal corresponds to their personality.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m also satified with both visuals and music. The artstyle is nice and the animation is of good quality. I liked the character designs and found them fitting the character&#039;s personalities. The heavy tones are great and fresh and go well with what we see. The opening song is no different from most of fripSide&#039;s songs (which is not necessarily a con if you like their style) and the ending song is fresh and catchy. I don&#039;t have any complaints about the voice acting either and I must admit I kind of fell in love with Youko&#039;s voice.<br />
<br />
In spite of minor flaws, the only thing that actually bothers me is the open ending. I doubt there is going to be another season, so people that don&#039;t follow the manga are left guessing what happens next.<br />
<br />
All in all Killing Bites is an entertaining and action packed anime that is far from being anything groundbreaking but can be very enjoyable if you accept it for what it is. It&#039;s well made and I find it worth giving a try. If you simply want some cool action accompanied by (pretty brutal) fanservice, go for it and embrace it as the good quality simple fun it is.

One nights encounter with a beast girl that changed the life of a mediocre student and introduces him to a hidden world of bloody beast fights.  <br />
<br />
Based on a popular manga of the same name Killing bites is an action based anime that also feature elements of sci-fi and ecchi Killing Bites gives us the opportunity to see what exactly would happen

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275762">
        if beneath the hustle of bustle of modern day Japan there exists a hidden fighting arena where some of the societies largest and most well-known corporations and companies have formed vast power blocks that compete with each other via the use of bloody fights between human-beast hybrids called brutes in bloody matches called Killing Bites. Victory on the field will bring the corporations called Zaibatsu’s great fame and the countless rich people that bet on these matches great fortune and delight, but defeat will only result in your cold carcass being carted off as the next match takes over in a never-ending series of blood matches whose only job is to satisfy the rich. <br />
<br />
Taking place in the modern world the overall story for Killing Bites follows the life of Yuuya Nomoto a somewhat mediocre university student that whether through luck or design has had nothing but an uneventful life where it seems no matter what he does he cannot be successful in it. One night a casual acquaintance of his rings him up asking him to help in picking up girls to which he decides to readily help for friendship&#039;s sake. But never in his wildest dreams would Yuuya once imagine that doing would not only result in his friends being ripped to shreds but also introduce him to not just the curious beast girl Hitomi but also introduce him to the hidden world of the killing bite arena’s where not everything is as straightforward as society is. Joining Yuuya in his foray into the world of the ferocious world of killing bites is the direct but unexpectedly kind Hitomi, the cheerful and teasing Eruza and the elegant but arrogant Yoko. <br />

Yuuya Nomoto voiced by veteran voice actor Wataru Hatano of Fairy Tail and Nogizaka Haruka no himitsu fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A second-year university student initially Yuuya was someone that can be said to be the very definition of mediocrity having until the start of the series been living a life that had been dictated by society. A kind, caring and understanding person by nature Yuuya is someone that can be said to be someone that prefers to stay in the background and not draw attention to himself as he navigates the path called life a fact that he manages to accomplish for the most part thanks to his quiet and calm nature. In the beginning of the series Yuuya was noted to be someone that got scared of the unknown rather easily which is somewhat understandable if you were to see either beast human hybrids fight against each other or your so-called friends being torn into shreds. However, while certainly a mediocre person at first it can be seen that beneath this side of his Yuuya is someone that is responsible and logical and is someone that cares deeply about people whether they are his friends or merely allies something that may seem absurd by the other zaibatsu’s but not so for Yuuya. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on and Yuuya gets to see more about what the killing bites involves and the true nature of the brutes Yuuya’s attitude gradually starts to change. At the beginning of the series Yuuya had a most unfortunate of first encounters with Hitomi and as a result, viewed her as something akin to an unwelcome intruder into his life though not something that he can easily say to her in person. However, as the series progresses and Yuuya and Hitomi interact more this sense of seeing her as a threat gradually disappears as Yuuya starts seeing Hitomi and the other hybrids as lifeforms and not monsters as the other zaibatsu’s have treated them. Because of this Yuuya also developed a determination and desire to save and protect Hitomi from not just the games played by the various zaibatsu’s outside of the killing bites but also inside them as well. As the series goes on this feeling of wanting to protect the hybrids gradually starts to expand as Yuuya gets to see how the other hybrids are treated and viewed by the other zaibatsu which is fuelled by his desire to see them be treated as lifeforms and not tools. While not having much trust in Hitomi in the beginning as the series progresses and as Yuuya and Hitomi overcome challenge after challenge this starts to change as Yuuya begins to place his trust in Hitomi trusting in both her skill and her confidence in navigating the best path to victory. This aspect of trusting Hitomi to make her own decisions on the field rather than issue her commands like other Zaibatsu’s would I felt was a great indication of the trust that was developed between the two. In line with this trust it can also be seen that Yuuya’s personality and attitude also changed with it as for the first time Yuuya was able to make his own decisions that are based on his own reasoning and judgement and for the first time in his life finally take control of his own life and not get caught in the pace of others like he did previously. A change that I thought was well done. The character of Yuuya I felt was an interesting character that while cowardly and unreliable at first gradually got stronger and more determined as the series went on as a result of the increasing trust that he had for Hitomi as well as his desire to be a better person as well. I felt that his voice actor Wataru Hatano did an excellent job at portraying the character of Yuuya.   <br />
<br />
Hitomi <br />
<br />
Hitomi voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Sora Amamiya of Aldnoah Zero and Plastic memories fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A high school girl that Yuuya meets at the beginning of the series Hitomi is a confident, intelligent and fast thinking person that prefers action rather than thinking things through. While a calm girl by nature Hitomi is also someone that shows a certain level of arrogance in her actions that comes from the fact that she see’s herself as the strongest hybrid in the killing bites. A fact that she uses to openly taunt her opponents such is the confidence that she has in her own skills. As a result of her desire to want to leap straight into action Hitomi is someone that can be said to have a very direct personality as she see’s anything that’s unrelated to that as worthless and as a result she views things like bonds and friendships with something approaching disdain. While a brave and a tenacious fighter Hitomi is also noted to be someone that’s also merciful and honourable and will not fight opponents that are too heavily injured a trait that she also shares with fellow fighter Tiger. As with all hybrids Hitomi is also someone that also has a human side to her character and in this it can be seen that in this form her attitude is somewhat different being a polite, kind and sweet-natured girl that has a large appetite a personality more benefiting of a high school girl than her usual attitude does. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on Hitomi’s personality gradually starts to change as she starts getting used to the team up that had been forced on her. At the beginning of the series, Hitomi was someone that exhibited typical loner attributes as she was quiet and preferred to keep to herself at all times even though it will be better to make friends and create a bond with your guardian something that should be important for all brutes. As a result of her unfamiliarity with normal human social culture, Hitomi was also noted to be someone that got embarrassed with the most minor of things, unlike her fellow brute Eruza. While initially distrustful of both Eruza and Yuuya as the series progresses and they overcome challenges together a gradual bond and trust is eventually formed between them. While Eruza’s naturally playful nature in the beginning often got on Hitomi’s nerves as the series progressed Hitomi’s attitude towards this gradually softened and she learned to treat these as just another aspect of her personality. This gradual thawing of Hitomi’s personality as she starts to realise the importance of bonds and friendships I felt was well done as it highlighted the increasing trust that she had towards not just Yuuya her guardian but also the other brutes that she encounters along the way and realising that perhaps there is more to life than combat after all. The character of Hitomi I felt was an interesting character that had some good development as the series went on. I felt that her seiyuu Sora Amamiya did an excellent job of portraying the character of Hitomi. <br />
<br />
Eruza <br />
<br />
Eruza voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Maaya Uchida of Charlotte and Gate fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Hitomi’s fellow brutes. A member of an opposing Zaibatsu Eruza initially appeared to be a typically hyperactive high school girl that Hitomi and Yuuya encounter in the course of their journey however as events progress this proves to be not the case. Like Hitomi, Eruza is a member of the brutes but in contrast to Hitomi Eruza’s personality is markedly different. A kind, positive and cheerful girl by nature Eruza is also someone that’s teasing and playful by nature and loves to poke fun at other’s traits that I feel suit her hybrid origin pretty well. Unlike Hitomi, Eruza is also someone that’s intelligent and fast thinking able to approach each situation with calmness and cautiousness and makes great use of tactics to fight her battles. While competitive to a degree Eruza is also someone that knows when the tide has turned and would try to retreat when this occurs rather than fight to the last. However, when pressed into a situation where she can’t readily do so Eruza’s tenacious nature would show up that makes her a ferocious opponent. <br />
<br />
At the beginning of the series Eruza while calm and composed for the most part was also noted to be somewhat overconfident and was someone that had great pride in her abilities as a brute. While not openly pushing away people away from her Eruza was also noted to be someone that didn’t trust easily something that her life as a brute has forged in her. As a result of this while positive and cheerful Eruza was noted to not have many friends that she can rely on though interestingly enough she’s able to blend more into human culture than Hitomi does due to this aspect. As the series progresses and Eruza gradually learns what friends are this starts to gradually change and she starts forging bonds with others and forging friendships with them. The character of Eruza I felt was an interesting one as in addition to being a capable brute in her own right she also served as a great contrast to Hitomi in terms of both attitude and personality and showed that if you have something to fight for that you would fight even harder to protect it. <br />
<br />
Yoko Mitsukado <br />
<br />
Yoko Mitsukado voiced by veteran seiyuu Megumi Han of Twin Stars Exorcist fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is the series main villain. The granddaughter of the president of the Mitsukado Zaibatsu Yoko is on the surface a calm, elegant and composed young woman that is also intelligent, rational and logical. A very determined and haughty person Yoko is someone that is shown to be both very loyal to her grandfather as well as to the Zaibatsu and exhibits great pride in her belief that her zaibatsu is one of the strongest ones in Japan. Additionally, Yoko is shown to have a great deal of respect in the killing bites and the traditions that it represents. As a result of this Yoko dislikes people that are either not serious about the idea and purpose of the killing bites or are misusing it for their own ends which makes her both an enemy of both Yuuya and Shidoh the latter of which she see’s as her most hated enemy. As someone of such conviction it’s perhaps unsurprising to note that Yoko is also a very adept strategist and is able to prepare for many different situations while at the same time thinking several steps ahead of her opponents in order to achieve her aim. In this she’s shown to be not only ruthless but also someone that doesn’t let rules hinder her showing that as long as her goal is achieved in the end nothing else matters. <br />
<br />
In the beginning of the series it was noted that Yoko while believing fervently in the main ideas of the killing bites was someone that viewed the hybrids as assets but not lifeforms and as a result of seeing Yuuya and Hitomi’s relationship grow as they grew to trust each other gradually saw him as both a rival that she had to crush and an enemy that stood against everything that she believed to be true from the killing bites. As a result of this Yoko become determined to crush Yuuya and crush what she see’s to be the foolish sentiments that Yuuya has. This, in turn, is reinforced by her view that Yuuya is someone that is not even qualified to be at the same table as she is.  The character of Yoko I felt was an interesting one as in addition to being a rival in the killing bites Yoko was also someone whose views on both the killing bites and on brutes, in particular, were polar opposites to Yuuya. This clash of both personalities and beliefs that were played out in the killing bites I felt was well done and appropriate as it allowed them to settle their differences on something that both are invested in. I felt that her seiyuu Megumi Han did an excellent job of portraying the character of Yoko. <br />

AMV <br />
In terms of animation, I thought that the series various locales and settings were well designed and though limited showed a good variety in the types of areas that the fights took place in. The designs for the various characters and especially the brutes I thought was well done and I really appreciated the great variety of animal types that was used as the template to create the brutes. The combat between the brutes which also serves as the series main premise I thought was not just well designed but also well animated and really showed how brutal and gritty such fights would be. In terms of music, I thought that the series OST did a great job at providing the scenes with music that matched the feelings that each scene invoked in us. The series opening and ending themes also did a great job of creating a sense of anticipation for the series as well. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series voice cast did an excellent job at voicing their assigned characters with Sora Amamiya, Maaya Uchida and Megumi Han deserving special praise for their portrayal of the characters of Hitomi, Eruza and Yoko. <br />
<br />
Overall Killing Bites was an interesting anime that I really enjoyed seeing with its main strong points being its interesting premise, story, characters, combat scenarios and voice acting. <br />
The main premise of Killing bites is, of course, the titular fights between the brutes that are overseen by large and very ancient corporations called Zaibatsu’s. These fights between the brutes that are fielded by the Zaibatsu’s I thought was interesting as while also gritty and brutal it not only gave us the opportunity to see the types of animals that were used to create the hybrids that would fight for the zaibatsu’s when the time came but also look at the way that said zaibatsu’s treated their brutes. In the case of the former the types and identities of the animals that were used as the source of the traits for the hybrids I thought was surprising as not only did it use the more common ones like lions but also rarer ones like the honey badger and the pangolin the latter of which I had to look up as it was a term not seen before. This use of the traits of some of natures most powerful creatures on the brutes that will fight on the Zaibatsu’s behalf I thought was an interesting idea and helped bring into reality the childish dreams that many kids would have about such fights. In the case of the latter which was the Zaibatsu’s treatment of the brutes that serve them, I thought that the series did a great job of showing how the brutes are treated. While the sacrifices that each brute has paid for gaining their new-found power is immense it can be said that this also contrasts with the treatment that each Zaibatsu treats them. While some Zaibatsu’s treat their brutes as careful investments that are to be used carefully others only see them as tools that are to be discarded when they have lived past their usefulness. This mixed view on the brutes that are literally putting their lives on the line for them I thought did a good job at showing just how brutal and gritty the world of the killing bites can be as they must not only do well to enhance the prestige of their zaibatsu but also to ensure that they aren’t put down for being useless. <br />
<br />
While the brutes can be said to serve as the main contestants for the killing bites it can be said that they are not the only ones that have a stake in the competition whether it’s within the single dual killing bites or the larger destroyal as without someone that can vouch for them and support them a brute no matter how powerful cannot enter the killing bites. As a result, a certain level of bond is needed between a brute and their financier whether that person is a zaibatsu or a single individual as the mc was. This bond between the two I thought was an interesting one as it not only reflected on the trust that exists between the brute and their financier but also shows that in the competition they are in this together. This bond while not always applicable to all zaibatsu’s was I felt used very well when used with the mc and Hitomi and only served to enhance the relationship that the two forges over the course of the series. The feeling that the lives of someone that you have bonded and befriended with has been placed in your hands and can change based on the decisions that you make during the matches I thought only served to reinforce the level of trust that both have for each other in the unforgiving fields of the killing bites. <br />
<br />
Overall Killing Bites was an anime that while having an interesting premise in the form of the fights between brutes also had a deeper story in the form of the forging of bonds between a brute and their financier that served to improve both as they confronted the harsh and bloody world of the killing bites and was something that I really enjoyed watching. While let down somewhat by underdeveloped characters and some odd pacing issues I thought that the series still did well in showing the brutal fights between human-beast hybrids that are betted upon by rich people in their hundreds while also paring that with a decent story that was populated by some well designed and developed characters. One thing the series I thought the series did well if I might add was its use of unexpected twists in the story which was much more apparent in the latter part of the series.  As a final score, I would give Killing Bites a 7/10.  <br />

    &quot;The beast with the sharpest fangs wins. That&#039;s what Killing Bites is.&quot; Your gonna hear that ALOT in this anime.<br />
<br />
Killing Bites REALLY isn&#039;t for everyone, it&#039;s for what LA would say is like one of those 90&#039;s violent schlock animes...that somehow sprung into the Winter of 2018. Well by violent schlock LA can say that Killing Bites has gory uncensored action, attempted rape, sadistic and unmoral characters and hell even the core concept of this anime is essentially a battle royale animorphism cockfighting and you know what...LA kinda loved it for all it&#039;s violent schlockiness.<br />
<br />
Killing Bites has some character developments towards the plot which focuses

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275780">
        on the before and during the Destroyal (aka. team battle royale). The two major character developments goes to our useless main male protagonist who was thrusted into the Killing Bites Yuuya Nomoto voiced by Wataru Hatano, who is Hitomi Uzaki&#039;s pushover minder. For such a bland main male protagonist, he DOES develop in the case of his life always being told what to do and him coming out in making his own path by the end of the series. The more interesting character however is the one that ALWAYS says the quote above, Hitomi Uzaki, an animorphic ratel/honey badger. She&#039;s self-centered, abrasive as all hell and doesn&#039;t give a crap besides fighting. She herself is given some sense of a backstory and why she is who she is for majority of the anime and even though Killing Bites has no &quot;tact&quot;, Hitomi&#039;s backstory gives at least a bit of levity to Hitomi&#039;s situation in the first place.<br />
<br />
As for minor characters, for the most part, we do get to see the backstories of many of Hitomi&#039;s opponents as well as their animorphism before their gruesome demises by the end of it. Some of Hitomi&#039;s teammates has some small backstories like Ui Inaba (Rabbit) voiced by Sumire Uesaka, always the scared character has some weird ending as to why she&#039;s here to why Ichinosuke Okajima voiced by Toru Okawa is participating in the Destroyal and heck even some of Hitomi&#039;s buddy-rivalry with Eruza Nakanishi voiced by Maaya Uchida has plenty of screentime with her as well as Youko Mikado voiced by Megumi Han, a player in the Destroyal as well as her reasoning in competing in it.<br />
<br />
Now for a battle royale setup of an anime your expecting that Hitomi has ALL the plot armour and to that yes and no, yes as she does have plot armour disguised as Hitomi&#039;s animorphic trait kicking in to save herself but she gets beaten up pretty badly later down the anime and STILL survive a probable fatal wound. But the &quot;no&quot; definitely comes up in at the end result of the entire Destroyal but LA wouldn&#039;t spoil you on THAT outcome.<br />
<br />
Killing Bites has also some actual factual things concerning the animals in question, some LA didn&#039;t even know existed, but the most focused on is the Ratel (or Honey Badger). Now Killing Bites does tend to exaggerate the honey badger for the sake of the plot and Hitomi&#039;s physical and mental prowess as a fighter but Killing Bites does it and it&#039;s actually is oddly informative about the animal in question, like the rabbit, cobra, gecko, tiger, lion and crocodile and how the animal traits and factors are used in battle, especially with the over exaggerated narrator Junichi Sawabe makes it synergically interesting to watch animal essentially cockfighting while information about them is given to us and us connecting the dots to the fight much easier.<br />
<br />
And finally before getting into the technicals, Killing Bites always end the segment with Oshie Nodoguro voiced by Sayaka Harada who &quot;acts&quot; like a honeyguide animorphic however isn&#039;t one and she mainly interacts with Hitomi in some comedic skits with her and she&#039;s pretty funny all things considered.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation done by LIDENFILMS.......this is LIDENFILMS bread and butter in terms of gritty atmosphere and gruesome battles, LIDENFILMS by all accounts know how to make these bleak atmospheric yet exhilarating battles and it&#039;s as bloody or gory as all hell. LA would give props to the character designs in both the human and animorphic aspect to them (as they have the entire human form is similar to their animal form). The battles are uncensored gory messes and yes the fanservice by all means is there and shown in rather detailed and sometimes intentionally fan-DIService manner, but yeah it&#039;s LIDENFILMS, they do this kind of stuff and this was what LA expected from LIDENFILMS. It just has all the hallmarks of their work and detail in violently detailed animation with gritty atmosphere (see Schwarzesmarken).<br />
<br />
As for voice acting, well LA has seen a bit of Sora Amamiya playing up the abrasive type and she goes all out as Hitomi. From voice actors like Maaya Uchida and Sumire Uesaka did pretty well but Megumi Han as Youko Mikado was pretty interesting as well (though at first LA mistook her for Shizuka Ito) as Megumi Han goes apeshit hammy in this role (and no that&#039;s NOT a pun), kinda makes sense due to the nature of Killing Bites but still. The voice cast overall is hammy most of the time with some interesting casting here and there but the best voice actors for LA would be a tie between Megumi Han and Sora Amamiya just for some of the overtop craziness they displayed.<br />
<br />
Killing Bites does have some vague themes on corruption which does concern the Destroyal itself and the founders and it&#039;s companies that are betting on the winner without a care in the world for those who have DIED in the Destroyal with the best counterpoint link to this being Youko Mikado herself and her reasoning in participating however Killing Bites is obviously blatantly showing us of human&#039;s greed is everywhere and what lengths of corruption for them to keep their greed to the point of death and their scummy ways time and again by even having the Destroyal in the first place but *ahem* vague themes...<br />
<br />
Killing Bites is by far LA&#039;s guiltiest pleasure anime of Winter 2018 in all it&#039;s violent schlock, narm in it&#039;s more dramatic moments and being informative about animals all under the umbrella of a battle royal animorphic cock-fighting show, it&#039;s one batshit crazy concept and Killing Bites just takes and runs with it without a care in the world what anyone thinks because Killing Bites has no tact in keeping things innocent. Killing Bites just doesn&#039;t give a shit and LA doesn&#039;t think it really doesn&#039;t care WHO it offends and LA frickin&#039; loved it for having that atmosphere about it. Mind you, LA was initially put off by Killing Bites at first but grew on LA as LA got to know Killing Bites a bit more and as it went into the Destroyal, LA&#039;s attention was all in for the violent madness that unfolded. Killing Bites actually had some method to the madness as insanely crazy as it gotten.<br />

A:&quot;Alien stuff? Dunno&quot;<br />
D:&quot;We&#039;re not the History Channel for pete&#039;s sake... Anyone else? Joe?&quot;<br />
Joe:&quot;You know how &#039;Animal face-off&#039; was a pretty nice show, right&quot;<br />
D:&quot;Hmm yeah, that&#039;s actually not a bad idea, a new season would be -&quot;<br />
Joe:&quot;How about this time is animated and with scarcely clothed hot chicks!&quot;<br />
D:&quot;...&quot;<br />
Joe:&quot;And in order to appeal to the youth we should have highschool girls...&quot;<br />
D:&quot;... Joe...&quot;<br />
Joe:&quot;And... and -&quot;<br />
D:&quot;Joe this is it, you&#039;re fired&quot;<br />
Joe:&quot;What, why&quot;<br />
D:&quot;Leave now or I&#039;ll call security&quot;<br />
Joe:&quot;But wait -&quot;<br />
D:&quot;SECURITY&quot;<br />

Later on, Joe made his own anime studio and thus decided to get back at his

        old boss...<br />

<br />

<br />
Killing Bites is at the crossroad between abomination and a decent show. I was surprised the show is actually enjoyable even if it mostly consists of ecchi that can only appeal to 12-year-olds without internet.<br />
 <br />
I assume they&#039;ll just attempt to add a &quot;story&quot; to the mindless violence this show is and manage to ruin it (something that&#039;ll be preeetty impressive considering it&#039;s already bordering train wreck).

    It&#039;s about a story animal humans fighting each other in a tournament. There is some progressions between the main guy and the main girl. There might be some unintentional spoilers along the way so please understand the concerns.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Personally I think the story was kinda lame, basically battle royale between characters, seen too many of those types of cliché stuff so nothing really unique.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The artstyle was somewhat unique so far i&#039;ve seen in anime so that&#039;s something to go for if you are into the art but then again i wouldn&#039;t suggest watching this anime just because of the art.<br />
Had some ecchi scenes if you are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276266">
        also into that.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The ost in here was ok, nothing really out of this world but fitted the theme. Though I still wouldn&#039;t listened to this anime&#039;s ost in free time/gym.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
The character development didn&#039;t go above the average level which in my case i would say lacking a lot of it. It definitely had potential in the beginning but it was too focused on the battle royale so all the characters was being forcefully dragged in without giving time to develop anything. I must say that at the end of the anime the character development literally just fell apart. Why would you even do that type of ending when you had so much more potential?<br />
A Big Fat MINUS!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
 It was enjoyable in the very beginning and had some ok pacing here and there but once it reached the later stages the paces started to go out of control. A big minus here again.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
I would love to give it higher scores but this anime did not make it through good enough. <br />
Definitely wouldn&#039;t recommend watching this anime, it just leaves a bad taste after (no, its not a bitter sweet ending just to make it clear).<br />
<br />

    Whoever has the sharpest claws wins.. not in this case.<br />
<br />
Story 5: its another battle royale! Not really special, but I do like the whole animal side of it. Having their animal features and their abilities was pretty cool.<br />
<br />
Art 5: Noting special here, a couple of good ecchi scenes though.  <br />
<br />
Sound 5: Voices were good, tracks were okay and the tracks reminded me of the 90s rock music (the middle cut scene)<br />
<br />
Character 4: I didn&#039;t like alot of them, you have the typical shy guy that has a hot girl as a partner. If I had to pick a favorite character it would be kido

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276602">
        takeshi, I love for what he stands for and his story about his mother was good too.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 4: I did like it (since I finished it lol), best part of the anime was when Hitomi and Eruza were in that confused state. <br />
The ending was good too, it was a good twist. <br />
<br />
Overall 4.8: It was good, not much more to say tbh. <br />
<br />
Would I recommend? <br />
I mean why not its not pathetic, its okay. I would say don&#039;t waste your time watch something better, but you watch what you want :D<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading! <br />
If you have any question or talk anime feel free to msg me :D

    First of all Thank you to the Killing Bites team to presenting this Anime.It was Amazing.<br />
<br />
And now about anime, when it started in first it was like whats going on, the starting was average but then it after some episodes it started to hit the mark, if i talk about story well it was good but what i special liked was the ending of the Killing Bites because the Main Thing, Main Story Starts from here...<br />
The Art was well how to say it was kinda ero..(liked them) and the characters was interesting.<br />
What hit me hard was the end part and it made me so excited

    Just because it doesn&#039;t have a solid story doesn&#039;t make it trash.<br />
<br />
I see a lot of hate for this anime. I&#039;m not really sure why but i&#039;m really enjoying it and i&#039;m not even fapping either lol. Hitomi is bad ass, i like the concept and it reminds me of those AniMorph books i used to read but more adult themed. <br />
<br />
Honestly this is my type of anime if only there was a real story. The art is good, the action and animation is good, the characters have good especially the females. (Of course) <br />
<br />
Overall 9/10 because the lack of actual story but this anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269734">
        is really great. I&#039;ve most definitely seen worse.

    Killing Bites is your basic Battle Royale fighting anime with some ecchi thrown in... AND CHARACTERS WHO CAN TRANSFORM INTO ANIMALS!<br />
<br />
This show is the best of the best. You watch the first episode and think, &quot;oh god this is awful&quot; AND YOU&#039;RE NOT WRONG but oh does it get better! Ratel quickly tries gunning for the Best Girl spot and from there it is a hot pursuit between Tiger and Rabbit. The characters in this show are all amazing, even Cobra with his dual cannons was an alright character. Ratel is easily the most likeable and without her I don&#039;t think we&#039;d ever figure out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274691">
        what Killing Bites is really all about. Her catchphrase is anything but forgettable and she never forgets to say it every episode (except *insert episode numbers here*). <br />
<br />
This show is also EDUCATIONAL! You can, in fact, throw this show on for your kids and have them learn a ton of animal facts! For instance, did you know that Crocodiles are literally immune to AIDs?! Or that Cobra&#039;s have TWO penises?! Fascinating!! This show never ceases to amaze me. The show even goes all out during its educational segments where they show you the most gorgeous of art for the animals depicted. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment? What&#039;s not to enjoy? It&#039;s a show where a bunch of animal cosplayers duke it out in order to see who is the most OP animal. There is nothing UNenjoyable about this show.<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;d say this show is something of a gem this season and I&#039;ve never not been excited to watch it each week. <br />
<br />
TL;DR- This show is a little memey and the first episode is probably going to turn everyone away but you stick around long enough for the fighting to start and you learn that the show is a true treasure that is deserving of this high a rating.

    this is one of those action ecchi animes that wont satisfy most peoples taste it is trash the good kind of trash if you turn you brain off and just take it as an mindless action ecchi anime you will enjoy it a lot the fights are great there is not much talking but more fighting its exiting the music is spot on and gets you hyped up they do give character development in between the fights witch keeps you invested thou some of the animals are wrongly portrayed and are more buffed for sake of looking cool more than animal consistency and i must

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275463">
        address the elephant in the room that one catchphrase witch everyone hated from Strike the Blood “No senpai, this is owner fight” yes they have something similar here that might make you mute the episode each time they are about to say it &quot;.... doesn&#039;t matter. The one with the sharpest claws wins&quot; yea people will have nightmares about that line for weeks after watching this and its in every episode stayed at least one sometimes more than once ...<br />
<br />
story: 8 there is some plot going on but were not here for it were here to see boobies and fights so on that part the story is spot on<br />
<br />
music: 8<br />
<br />
Art: 8 the art is nice to look at you can see blood and the fights are exiting the fan survive is survivable<br />
<br />
enjoyment personally i had a blast 10 even thou i should know better it had funny comedy as a bonus and most of all i didnt get bored at any point even in the most cringe parts<br />
<br />
over all score 8

    To keep it short.<br />
<br />
Too much rape. Pretty grim stuff, a couple of people are raped and Cheetah gets aggressively molested. Main male protagonist is pretty much background noise in a cafe, not important one bit. Hitomi is rather sexy with a severe dad complex. Usagi Chan was a cutey, would protect. That ending was, well... bad.<br />
A bizarre animal-human hybrid dystopia? alrighty then.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not a nice world this takes place in. It is a very sad place. Everyone has an ulterior motive, people get killed for no real purpose, the people who should die, don&#039;t, rape is common sight. This does not make me happy.

    Killing Bites is a fighting anime about fighters with animal powers. The powers of tits that is! I&#039;m just fooling around (with their tits), it&#039;s actually a pretty great fighting anime. Whole chunks of it is clearly fanservice but it&#039;s actually quite amazing. The fanservice is actually incorporated into the plot in some cases (although in fairly obvious ways). Episodes consist of spectacular fight scenes with lots of gore and learning more information about other contestants in this fantastic fighting anime.<br />
<br />
The animation is amazing and the characters are pretty great for a 12-episode show. The level of detail is really nice and they will always

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332505">
        keep you guessing as to which fighter will come up on top in each encounter. There is not really any serious faults with this anime EXCEPT for how trashy it is. If it wasn&#039;t for that this would probably be a top fighting anime.<br />
<br />
If you like fighting or anything to do with it this is for you. However, be prepared for some downright degenerate scenes. If you are a prude this isn&#039;t for you.

    On the surface everyone wants to simplify this into a fan service show, but of any fan service show show I&#039;ve never seen the excess of emotion and brutality as I&#039;ve seen throughout this show.<br />
It&#039;s true that many things end of being fairly standard as far as fights and relationships go but by the last episode it&#039;s very clear that the betrayals and deaths that have piled up have formed a world that is unlike any in any fiction ever made. No joke.<br />
The story is admittedly quite slow but after the first 4 episodes there&#039;s enough madness to keep you interested and as the show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276435">
        creeps to its conclusion it&#039;s easy to doubt that there will be much of a spectacular ending to the show, after all most anime don&#039;t venture very far from conventional story telling. However, death is very much a big part of the show, don&#039;t let the personalities of the characters fool you.  If they seem too carefree it&#039;s due to their mafioso outlook towards the world.<br />
The combat covers every conceivable outcome, from thrilling second to second brawls to 10 second borefests.  But you might wonder why I score this show so high and that&#039;s due to its UNPREDICTABILITY.  The best fights aren&#039;t always between the predictable characters and some built up fight end up very standard mainly due to how animal fighting styles differ or are so similar between the combatants.<br />
Admittedly, it&#039;s pretty safe to assume that the smaller the animal is that the fighter&#039;s animal is based on, the more dangerous the fighter, but again UNPREDICTABLE.   Even if it feels standard at first, just enjoy the cheesiness and wonder about every possible way the show could go, because you will almost certainly be wrong.<br />
<br />
The characters aren&#039;t deep but it&#039;s obvious that this show is starting from the ground and building the characters up.  The ost is just all around enjoyable with its guitar riffs and very much above average OP and ED.  Art wise I never so anything bad, sure it could be better but as far as an adaptation goes, it was no more and no less than 100% accurate.<br />
<br />
I pray for a second season to unfurl some time in the future, but honestly the ending of this makes me wonder whether a sequel could surpass the hype that this first season was able to create.

    Summary: Stupid but entertaining. I may have watch this all the way through purely out of appreciation for the Honeybadger meme...that and the T&amp;A.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m fairly certain that anyone who has watched even one season of anime will recognise this for what it is. Ecchi battle anime. Surprisingly, there&#039;s even the semblance of a story too...just don&#039;t expect much.<br />
<br />
All of the characters, and I do mean ALL, are very one dimensional, the artwork and animation is average, the music is rather forgettable but, in terms of Ecchi, it&#039;s actually pretty decent. They do manage to make several of the female characters believable and sexy while making

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275765">
        them appear capable of the kind of fighting depicted in the anime (there&#039;s more than a few pairs of &quot;muscular Thighs&quot;). That rather surprised me. I was also surprised by how the final episode panned out...they clearly intend to make more of this.<br />
<br />
One additional little treat is the end credits sequence, I got one or two solid laughs out of it.

    The Killing Bites experience is similar to that of porn—not necessarily because you could easily jack off to either, but mostly for that aftermath with which we are all to familiar. You have a great time, but in finishing up after your session, you make the realization that you just so thoroughly enjoyed the last several minutes and it makes you disgusted–both with the content, and with yourself. Dejectedly tucking your shrinking chub into a more comfortable position, you expel a knowing sigh. You&#039;ll be back for more.<br />
<br />
Killing Bites is degenerate, cheesy, over-the-top trash. In other words: it&#039;s fantastic. I love it. It&#039;s funny, action-packed,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276201">
        and sexy. To summarize: it sucks. I hate it. No anime should be so bad, and yet so enjoyable. It doesn&#039;t fit any mold. It&#039;s got style. It&#039;s absurd. Killing Bites is worth watching simply because it is fun.<br />
<br />
Story: decent, never slow, and it doesn&#039;t get in the way of that supple &quot;plot&quot;.<br />
Visuals: varied and engaging fights with skimpy shots aplenty. Seriously though, the fights are quality.<br />
Characters: original and interesting to watch, some of which are totally not at all catering to any fetishes I have or have since acquired, I swear.<br />
Enjoyment: far more enjoyable than is rationally acceptable. This is the strongest of this show&#039;s assets–aside from those present on the heroines.<br />
<br />
9/10. Would I trade my dignity for a couple hours of good entertainment again? Yes. Yes I would.

    I truly enjoyed the anime. After I watched it I started to read the manga since there is no season 2. <br />
Story: Nomoto agrees to become a driver for his mates and they abduct a girl named Hitomi. Which later turn out to be a Human animal hybrid. Then for some reason Nomoto has been made into Hitomis caretaker even though its the opposite. Later on Nomoto has been forced into joining a battle royale where Hitomi competes. The &quot;caretakers&quot; move the players around the map like playing chess. <br />
Characters: Nomoto is this college kid who is kinda relatable. He is funny and kind. Hitomi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323001">
        is this human who can transform into a honeybadger. She is very badass and funny in a sense. There are also many other competitors who are super strong and badass.<br />
The ost is fucking amazing.<br />
Animation is very smooth and cool looking. <br />
I do recommend this anime to everyone. This show also tells about the animals in which they can transform. That is why Honebadgers are my favourite animals.

    I have to say, I started up with this anime because I saw it on Amazon. Watched a few episodes and thought that the little bit of information the show gave on the different animals was actually interesting and helped provide an understanding to the characters actions.<br />
<br />
At the start the anime seemed like it was going to be 90% about the fan service, but the actual fights were interesting and decently well thought out, pulling in the characteristics of real animals and the way they would likely interact in the wild was pretty good. I liked both the main and sub-main characters as they fit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296868">
        into their roles pretty well. Both Hitomi and Nomoto progressed and developed throughout the season.<br />
<br />
So I decided to look for the manga and after a binge session of that I returned to the anime to watch it the rest of the way through just to give it the fair shake and see how everything was done in the anime.<br />
<br />
Let me just say, there is a reason why I gave this a 7/10 for overall and 7/10 for character and story. They go through this drawn out process of explaining the characters back story, which was good, I enjoy exposition because it actually allows us to relate to the characters on a more human level; but then after establishing that there was an extremely high bond of trust (not only though dialogue out lout but also internal dialogue), they make their main character completely betray that bond. This is not only breaking the few character rules they set up through the story but also the rules they established for the animalistic side of the character.<br />
<br />
And for those whom haven’t read the manga and know what is coming in Season 2, skip over the next two paragraphs, but this is very essential for those that have watched through to episode 12 and are as pissed off about the ending as I am… <br />
<br />
I read to that part of the manga and was disgusted with this choice in the story; it’s lazy, it’s poor character development and it defeats the ability to identify with either of the main characters from that point on. Hitomi’s character through the show is established to not care about killing that which is not a challenge to her. She thirsts to be the strongest among the beasts and then they turn around and have her basically assassinate the character she was established to have trusted, completely and totally out of the blue.<br />
<br />
Then they turn around and make Nomoto into a pseudo bad guy; planning his revenge against a person whom he had developed feelings of adoration towards. They would have been better off to not have her attack him at all and tell him to run away, to never show his face again, but him to return to help her break free of the corporations control and free from her bond with Reiichi Shido. Overall this plot line detracts from the series and I feel it was a very flawed design that will turn many people off of wanting to watch more if the anime is completed through a second season.<br />
<br />
If you skipped the above you can read the rest without worry...<br />
<br />
As for the rest of the scores, the actual animation was well done, a mix of mediums which works very well together along with organized and well placed ambient music tracks that only serve to add to the drama on screen. I liked the overall character designs and the concepts of the fights and how they worked out. I am a bit confused as to how Hitomi’s arm was reattached but I’m just going to write that off on science fiction DNA mumbo-jumbo and give it a pass.<br />
<br />
Up until the last episode of the first season, the story was well done; (if only they could ret-con the end of episode 12, we’d be great), but overall the show hit where it should for the audience it was written for. Would I tell my friends it’s worth watching? Yes; but with the caveat of informing them there was an extremely bad, and poorly written plot twist at the end. <br />
<br />
This could have been a 9 or 10/10 show, but poor writing for the end of the season destroys what could have been great and turns it into any other poorly written anime/manga series that will likely die in its second season. <br />
