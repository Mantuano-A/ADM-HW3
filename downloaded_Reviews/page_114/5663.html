    &quot;Dakara Boku Wa&quot; Starts off with this strange perverted Open minded boy walking around with his childhood friend. He is very known at his school for being a pervert, and many dislike him.<br />
Basically They waste your time with Pointless half Hentai Crap for the first 6 episodes. Episode 1, you get the real point of the show and the direction it should be heading into. Then you hit episode 2, and you have a Pervert who has this strange ability to regain his power through getting aroused.<br />
<br />
On top of that through the rest of 3-6 they keep throwing Hentai-Like events at you, and slowly introducing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review118619">
        characters, something i felt they could have easily done and gotten over with in 2 episodes, and made the show 3x better.<br />
<br />
If you manage to get through the first 6 episodes of crap. your actually in for a treat, this show turns into gold. The plot rapidly increases with nothing but positive enjoyment.<br />
<br />
The story was Fair(6) It was poorly put together, but in the end quite satisfying and enjoyable.<br />
<br />
The Art was Very Good(8) Certainly not at a point where it could make you hate the show because of it being bad. The character design looked great.<br />
<br />
The Sounds was Decent(4) It made no difference towards helping the show look better, They just play this weird crap whenever the Hentai-like moments come on.<br />
<br />
The Characters were very good(8) they were very lovable, and created a suspenseful chose-like harem.<br />
<br />
The enjoyment was Good(7) the casual villains were stupid and always had that Hentai type attack form, where they are like octopus&#039;s, with tentacles...you know what i mean, its just stupid.<br />
<br />
Overall i rated this show a 6, and i find that to be a fair rating, if it was sectioned off into 2 sections, 1-6, and 7-12. I would have given the first section a 3, and the second section a 9.5<br />
So if you can sit through the first half, you should notice the quality increase in the second half.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re watching the show for the Highschool DxD like presence, or just the Hardcore Ecchi, the entire thing provides that greatly, and this is exactly what your here for.<br />
<br />
FEEDBACK: I would definitely appreciate feedback; it would help me to become a better writer.<br />
<br />

    If you&#039;re looking for an ecchi show, one that&#039;s filled with fan-service, one that has a perverted teen in his puberty years thinking about lewd thoughts, or a High School DxD clone, then look no further. So, I Can&#039;t Play H (also known Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai) is a series about a group of breasts with a perverted protagonist who makes the deal of his short life with a beautiful Shinigami, or in English terms, a grim reaper during a wet and rainy night.<br />
<br />
~ The Deal<br />
<br />
Or maybe known as the story. Well, the overall tone of the story is predictable and filled with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review70557">
        common cliché, gags, and fan-service. The young boy Ryosuke Kaga (also better well known as Ero-suke, which in my opinion is the better name that suits him considering his nature) plays the main role of the protagonist. He is a perverted at some degrees but at the same time surprisingly funny to watch for his charms and will to protect the girls, or in his words “girls are to be treasured”. He is sort of the middleman compared to other perverted protagonists of the common gag in today&#039;s anime industries. For one thing, yes..Ero-suke is perverted but at the same time has a heart of gold, especially towards the shinigami he made a deal with.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly though, there is an actual plot to this series. Can you believe it? An actual plot for an ecchi series! Well, foremost, there are tentacle like beings in the beginning that seems to come after the duo like pouring rice. Later on though, a more direct plot seems to develop and mysteries fill the void.<br />
<br />
~ Goddess and the Servant<br />
<br />
One of the main focus of the series is the interactions, relationship, and bond between main protagonists Ryosuke/Ero-suke and Shinigami Lisara Restall. With her deep scarlet hair and eyes, she is seen as a beautiful goddess of death. It is seems at first glance that she just wants to use Ryosuke for her own purposes. Later on though, we see that she does in fact cares for her dear servant, showing tendencies of care and even jealousy. Oh boy, my tsundere sense is tangling.<br />
<br />
~ Others of the Daily Life <br />
<br />
Of course, there are other characters that drives the series. We have the childhood friend who has boobs that evokes the jealousy of the other female cast. We have the Shinigami rival against Lisara who lately have developed a sense of lust and love towards Ero-suke. We have an idol who is seen as the mascot of the series. <br />
<br />
Talk about daily life being turned upside down for our poor protagonist. <br />
<br />
~ When life gives you money, you make fan-service<br />
<br />
Being an ecchi show, it is no surprise that the theme of tentacles comes into play. In fact, the first  episode and nearly every one so far shows this theme. And of course, clothes being shredded in combat, Ero-suke supplying his powers towards his partner through eroticism, and the inflatable boobs of our teen star idol also gives the show its gags. <br />
<br />
Strangely though, this series actually makes sense through its usage of fan-service. Can you believe it? It&#039;s actually part of the story. As clothes gets shredded, it symbolizes a loss of power and weakness. As it comes back together, so does strength and the will to fight again! And of course, curtsey of AT-X, the series offers uncensored (yum) for those who wants to avoid the dark shades, light, and fog of the series that hides our guilty pleasures.<br />
<br />
The art and music of this anime series is just average although some of the character designs actually seems to be quite appealing, namely Lisara&#039;s Shinigami outfit. If you don&#039;t believe me, just look at that beauty. Some of the soundtrack also plays its role to convey the battle moody actions in the other world against the tentacle like beings while other times just seems to be there and not really noticeable. <br />
<br />
Well, that&#039;s not entirely true. &quot;Platinum 17&quot; by yozuca (the Ending theme song of the series) seems to be quite noticeable. It seems to show a possible future romantic relationship between Ero-suke and Lisara, a “forbidden love” between master and servant. The flower, the bath, the bedroom, it&#039;s all there. Unfortunately though, he doesn&#039;t really manage to flower the pot. <br />
<br />
~ The verdict<br />
<br />
Well, to enjoy this series, I would say that focusing on the story and characters seems to be the key factor. Yes, there is fan-service. Yes, there are the gags. Yes, there is cliché. What did you expect? If you can&#039;t deal with it, then hit the drop button now. However, it does seem that the verdict is not carrying its bar so high. With some of the latter factors as well as the dull plot coming around, this series seems is going downhill. It&#039;s not as hot as it originally was before and that&#039;s not an understatement. Ultimately, this series is one of those guilty pleasures to watch but for those more into the advanced plot settings with more insightful characters, then look elsewhere.

    Boku-H is a perfect example of what ecchi harem shows are about, and in this review, I am here to explain why our standards of appreciation must be adjusted to account for what actually makes these types of shows enjoyable.<br />
<br />
By the normal standards of grading entertainment, we usually define quality entertainment as intelligent in some way.  Intelligent design for entertainment usually is produced through a well-thought out story and an interesting cast that has thought provoking development.  Naturally, it is very easy to dismiss Boku-H as being a mediocre show when it does in fact have an uninspired story that feels rushed and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review98631">
        confusing at its worst moments. Nobody is surprised by the usual boy meets fantasy girl who gets boy into sexy action packed adventures.  I will be the first person to admit that the story is nothing special by any means.<br />
<br />
The other point of appreciation for most entertainment also includes its physical quality, or essentially its sound and art.  Boku-H again would be easily considered unremarkable for the most part in this area. The soundtrack, while not awful, is relatively shallow and repetitive.  The animations are also not the most smooth, and heavily reliant on CG to fill in the gaps. This can be forgiven however given the nature of this particular show is ecchi.  While the rest of the show looks unremarkable, the show does its job of providing appealing scenes featuring its female cast nude in various situations.  If you are looking for an erotic anime, the nude scenes overall do not disappoint.<br />
<br />
So far, it sounds like I&#039;m saying that this show is overall a mediocre lump of fanservice.  Well, you would almost be right.  Because the thing I haven&#039;t yet explained is the REAL reason you should be watching this show.  If not story and art quality, what have I not yet covered? Characters.<br />
<br />
Yes, characters are the reason you should be watching these types of shows.  Specifically, I highly recommend paying attention to Ryosuke Kaga.  What usually defines ecchi harem shows are the main male character, because if we think for a moment logically, these shows very literally are centered around the adventures of our beloved main character.  What I am basically trying to say is that above all, the single most important thing that makes or breaks an ecchi harem (or a hentai for that matter) is almost always the main male character.  If he is likable and the artwork is passable, almost nothing else matters. A strong main character for these shows is the catalyst for viewers being able to relate to the humor and adventures created in these types of shows.  And I will go so far to say that Ryosuke from Boku-H is easily one of the best main characters that exists for a show of this type.<br />
<br />
Ryosuke has many qualities that should be used more in these types of shows, but aren&#039;t for some reason.  He&#039;s openly perverted, does not come off as creepy when his childhood friend inherently acknowledges him as kind and trustworthy, is never afraid to say exactly what is on his mind, and he has the guts to say &quot;size doesn&#039;t matter&quot; to his relatively flat-chested love interest Lisara. In short, he&#039;s hilariously manly to an extreme. He is hammy at times, but ultimately comes off very likable due to his honesty and kindness.  And best of all, he is voiced by Shimono Hiro, who once again succeeds at depicting manly hormonal teenage high school boys. Some of the dialogue that Ryosuke dares to say is extremely humorous, both in his shamelessness and the euphemisms he uses (get used to hearing the word &quot;kingdom&quot; for a while.  You&#039;ll know soon enough what it means if you don&#039;t know already).<br />
<br />
You might wonder why I haven&#039;t said anything about the female cast.  It&#039;s because they don&#039;t matter.  Yes I could argue that the female cast is objectively flawed, not particularly interesting, and just uninspired.  On the other hand, it could be potentially because this female cast is flawed and so blatantly represents certain stereotypes and tropes that Ryosuke can so easily express his true manliness in the most hilarious way possible. Again, the actual source of entertainment from this genre of show originates almost exclusively from the main character. This is neither a good or bad thing, it just simply needs to be factored appropriately when one picks up these types of shows.<br />
<br />
In general, when we pursue to immerse ourselves in entertainment, there are standards of quality that we use as a means of finding appreciation.  I personally find it very strange that many people seem to believe that ecchi harems as a whole are somehow not legitimate entertainment when Japan still consistently is able to find a market for it. Naturally, if you choose to approach this show with the expectation of finding attachment to an intelligent storyline, you are obviously going to be disappointed. However, when I compare this show to what other ecchi harems generally offer, I believe that this show definitely stands out as one of the better ones by faithfully providing sexy humor and adventures to laugh at. It is by relating to the main character that we can appreciate the madness that is pretty faces catered to a sexual orientation.  Boku-H does not disappoint here, providing what may be one of the best male protagonists in existence.

    The power of boners is stronger.<br />
<br />
The Short Version:<br />
(+)The art is actually pretty good.<br />
(+)Harem with a plot, a weak plot, but still a plot.<br />
(-)If you’re not here for the tits you’re in for a bad time.<br />
(-)The soundtrack is really unremarkable.<br />
(-)You can point at the characters and say, “You are this archtype and nothing else.”<br />
<br />
The Story (5/10): The story for this show is more than I was expecting given this is an ecchi-harem show, it starts off with a very honest MC who, when he’s heading home, suddenly meets a stunning red headed beauty. Who basically says hi by stabbing him in the chest with a sword.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review166739">
        Now effectively making him her power source whenever she gets into a fight, and the way he replenishes said power is… by getting a boner. I wish I got make this shit up.<br />
<br />
From this point on the show takes the standard harem show route. There’s a thing that the main girl needs the main guys help to get and they run through the standard enemies for a show like this. Monsters, people similar to the girl, the big bad guy at the end, etc. All the while slowly building up the main characters harem. There’s not really anything new to be found here at all, but the story doesn’t feel boring (Not to me anyway) and this is probably because I feel like the production team just went, “If we’re going to make an ecchi-harem show, might as well go all out.” And it kinda worked out for them in the end. Speaking of the end, it sucks.<br />
<br />
The Characters (5/10): As I said in the short version the characters aren’t really much more than well-worn archtypes, none of them bring anything new to said archtypes, and as a whole they are there to fill a role and nothing else. You have the tsundere, the girl with big tits, the (semi?) loli, the childhood friend, and the wimpy protagonist to wrap everyone up.<br />
<br />
Ryousuke Kaga: The honest MC and wielder of “The Kingdom”<br />
<br />
Lisara Restall: The tsundere and not bad for a redhead.<br />
<br />
Iria Fukumune: The one with the big tits and is dressed as a cow at one point.<br />
<br />
Mina Okura: The childhood friend and the childhood friend we all kinda wanted.<br />
<br />
Quele Sellier: The loli and half-sister to Lisara.<br />
<br />
There’s nothing else to say about the characters that I didn’t already, I will admit that I think Lisara and Mina are kinda hot though.<br />
<br />
The Art &amp; Sound (6/10) &amp; (5/10): The art of the show was done by Feel, who also did the animation for Outbreak Company and SNAFU, as well as Corpse Princess. Now that you have a general idea of the art style, the quality in this show is definitely more than I was expecting for a harem show, my expectation being that they put all of their effort into making the tits move and that’s it, and I was right. Mostly. They just managed to find a bit of time to animate the fights as well, which aren’t anything special but again, more than I was expecting.<br />
<br />
The sound of the show is entirely forgettable. I can’t remember anything of the OST, OP or the ED. The only thing that was standard was the voice acting and that’s the only thing that I didn’t forget.<br />
<br />
What do you think of this show?<br />
<br />
Not buying, not a chance in hell.<br />
<br />
Would you recommend this show?<br />
<br />
Want to watch an ecchi-harem to kill time? Go ahead.<br />
<br />
Goodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.

    When I first began this anime I didn&#039;t expect anything. It seemed like a stupid pervert ecchi story with a bit of fantasy mixed in.<br />
As I continued I realized it was exactly what I expected except that it&#039;s the best of its kind. <br />
Story-8<br />
Don&#039;t expect too much. 12 episodes, with a lead that is a pervert. How much development do you expect? It&#039;s sweet but not a &quot;make you think&quot; story like death note or code geass.<br />
Art-9<br />
Splendid. I love the art. The characters look marvelous. Even the guys don&#039;t look like monkeys or idiots.<br />
Character-8<br />
Typical harem. A perverted lead, tsundere, childhood friend, shy girl etc.<br />
Enjoyment-9<br />
This is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review68773">
        where the show shines. The jokes, the weird situations, even just watching the opening and ending theme is hilarious if you watch the pictures. <br />
Overall- 8<br />
It&#039;s nothing unique but very enjoyable. This is good for you if you just want a break and watch a funny show like sora no otoshimono. It&#039;s nice, fun, funny and nobody pisses you off. I mean seriously, plot twists and messed up villains are overrated. Sometimes you just need a little fun. It&#039;s a nice anime but it&#039;s not going to be a &quot;masterpiece&quot;.

    I will make this very very short since i suck at writing reviews.<br />
<br />
what you should expect from this anime is that it got some ecchi footage and lots of action already from first episode, but overall pretty funny scences xD<br />
<br />
I would recomend you to watch the first episode if you don&#039;t like it from there drop it but if you like it continue watching it, im sure there will be lots of funny and good scences.<br />
<br />
I really injoyed the first episode and can&#039;t wait for the next one.<br />
<br />

    &#039;Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai&#039; is your average ecchi rom-com with a few interesting twists thrown in here and there. That said and whether it&#039;s intentional or not, this anime has a lot of similarities with other well known series and if you&#039;re an anime savvy watcher it feels like many plot points here have been done before in a strikingly similar way elsewhere. <br />
<br />
The story is banal and doesn&#039;t really require much in-depth description.  The male lead, Ryosuke Kaga, is the stereotypical high school anime pervert and lives out his days oblivious to the powers high above. One day he meets a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review79320">
        redhead death god, Restall Risara, who happens to be on a hunt for the human with the highest amount of spiritual energy, or the &quot;special specimen&quot; as it&#039;s called in this anime. The first episode already looks somewhat similar to Bleach, plot-wise. Those of you that watched it, you surely remember the first episode where Ichigo and Rukia meet - it&#039;s raining outside and she stabs him with her sword so that he can defeat the hollow. Same thing in this anime, minus the hollow part and it happens inside the house. From that moment on they develop a partner (professionally speaking)  relationship. Again similar to how it was done with Rukia and Ichigo in bleach, where the male lead supports the female companion character as they strive towards a common goal. Of course this might be mere coincidence, stemming from the fact that there are lots of shinigami-based animes out there and through sheer probability, at least two of them will end up being similar. <br />
<br />
There are secondary characters of course - Fukumune Iria, Okura Mina, Sellier Quele. The first one is just for pure fanservice as is the case with Sellier. They have no real depth, the story doesn&#039;t expand upon them and they&#039;re just there so that we can see more breasts on the screen. So is the case with nearly all other female characters and it makes the series more generic. The only plot significant secondary character here would be Mina, who gradually rises in importance, especially in the later episodes of the series. Out of all characters I would say she&#039;s the responsible and sensible type but one character is not enough to make up for dozens of shallow ones. <br />
<br />
The story progresses from being carefree with romantic undertones to full-blown romantic drama by the end. Similar to Sora no Otoshimono, again whether it&#039;s intentional or a coincidence, these are only my personal observations. Risara and Ryosuke set out on an adventure which includes defeating many hollow-like looking monsters; another apparent similarity to Bleach that I personally noticed. The two main characters evolve from being mere strangers to something a lot more than that and we can see their relationship growing with each episode. The makers have done a really good job here and the tension between Risara and Ryosuke and how they come to terms with their feelings is a highlight of this anime. I for one, was excited to see the ending and how their relationship would eventually pan-out. <br />
<br />
As for Art, it is nicely done. Characters are well drawn. The colors are crisp and the style immediately catches your eye&#039;s full attention. One thing to note however is that violence and nudity are intertwined in this anime. A lot of fighting scenes will feature the girls being completely naked - much like in Elfen Lied, but with less blood. Whether the makers have purposefully adopted that kind of style from Elfen Lied or it&#039;s just me - I don&#039;t know, but it is something worthy to notice and discretion is advised. <br />
<br />
The voice acting is very convincing and the VAs themselves fit in nicely with this type of anime. The soundtrack as well as the opening and ending songs are catchy. <br />
<br />
All in all, this is a decent anime. The story isn&#039;t too bad but there are a few shortcomings, the most notable is the large amount of shallow and completely pointless characters and the fact that the plot lacks uniqueness to stand out from a pile of similar anime series. However at the same time the romance component here has been executed in the best way possible and this is a good anime for all those people who like watching romance-based series. You&#039;ll also get a few laughs out of this anime, as it is filled with eyebrow-raising situations and one liners. <br />
<br />
Therefore &#039;Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai&#039; gets a rating of 7 from me. It isn&#039;t bad but it isn&#039;t very good either. Watch it for fun and definitively for the romance and you will enjoy it.

    This is my first review so don&#039;t be too harsh...XD<br />
Id give it a 6.5~7 /10 ...i thought it was kinda of generic and bland...though the art and animation is good ,and the insertion of jokes are done well but in a also generic way .But the episode feels like it is lacking the main pole or pillar that supports the bridge,the story.As well as for the way of absorbing viewer.Normally first episodes are ended in a way that incites viewers to watch next episode.But this episode ended with a suspense event ,but one that is not striking enough IMO to have the viewers say ,I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review65653">
        have to watch next episode !I didn&#039;t read the manga because ppl were complaining about how the episode of the anime was inferior to the manga.So I watched the episode first.Back to the story the story was IMO lacking,there wasn&#039;t or was lacking rather a drive to the actions of the character.Speaking of which had rather overused generic personnalities,in other word they were kinda lacking depth.That&#039;s it for the anime.After seeing it i read the manga ...Well not surprisingly i thought is was better.But just comparing the first chapter and the episode.Some key element seems also to be lacking in the anime episode.And I also realised that the chemistry between the main chars is also missing which is kinda a big thin for me.In conclusion ,i though it was ok start for a series but i could of done better.And the lack of depth and drive is also understandable from the quantity of manga present.(If they have shown it like the manga then in a few episode it would catch up the manga)But the way they executed it was done in a rushed way.So in consequense the first episode results in a Ok episode .Though don&#039;t drop it yet,the series has a LOT of potential at hand .And the anime adaptation is not all at fault either.Maybe they decided to make and anime adaptation too early.<br />
<br />
Result:Good episode,ok~ish debut for a series with potential.<br />
Here my first review ,hope it helped(btw im def not dropping it ,waiting to see what will happen next)

    alright, second review time and it has been some time since my first one, this time i&#039;m going to discuss Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai, a mouth full if you ask me.<br />
<br />
First off let me say that this show is still airing and I will change my score when this show is completed, so this review is meant to give you an impression. <br />
Another thing I would like to point out from the start is that this show is ecchi, so for those people who don&#039;t like it, don&#039;t even start watching this as there are plenty of ripped clothes which will leave some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review69497">
        girls almost butt naked aside of some strings, so boobs, ass and shyness are there.<br />
<br />
With that being said, let&#039;s start off;<br />
<br />
Story 7; Now this is straight off where I&#039;m actually already bothered but also where I have to think off what still has to come. This show has great potential and can easily be 1 of the better shows out there at the moment, however the fighting scenes are generally always in the same order: enemy appears, girl gets in trouble because her energy is not high enough yet, boy gives energy, girl whoops enemy&#039;s butt.  Don&#039;t get me wrong though, the fighting scenes are pretty well done when it comes down to action, but I hope that it will change a bit in the future. <br />
<br />
Now for the rest of the story, as I said it has great potential and that is because so many things have not been explained yet, as the creators of this show keep giving slight hints that there is coming a major twist to this story, the real action still has to come, I won&#039;t explain what still has to come as I myself hate spoilers and I won&#039;t spoil things for you guys either.<br />
<br />
Art 9; Scenery is really well made, characters are not some sort of misformed animals and actually look pretty well. And as I explained earlier, fighting scenes are well made when it comes down to the actual moves of the characters, also it might just be me but I think that the shows is looking better now than it did at the start of the show, might be mistaken here though.<br />
<br />
Sound 7; nothing really special here, the voice actors do a decent job as so far I have no real hate for a specific character when it comes down to their voices, in fact each and everyone of their voices suit the character pretty well.<br />
BGM and opening/ending are mediocore, nothing that will stay with you when this show is over but still decent enough to make you somewhat enjoy it for the moment and the BGM does it&#039;s job by adding some tensity or calming atmosphere to the scenes.<br />
<br />
Character 8; This is another point that I will most likely change when this show is over, I will briefly explain why, the main characters show promise when it comes down to their power and character development in general considering romance etc. However this still has to be done of course and I hope the creators do this otherwise the score for this will drop as fast as a human in the air without a parachute.<br />
<br />
Now on to a little in-depth viewing;<br />
<br />
The main protagonist, (Kaga, Ryosuke) is NOT as in most ecchi, action animes a complete weakling who is incredibly pathetic, in fact he is the one who has to save the female protagonist almost the whole time but there is a good reason for that which I won&#039;t explain as it would spoil too much.<br />
<br />
Where this guy gets his power from is absolutely hilarious in my opinion and I think most people would agree with me, he is a very likeable character and for once I enjoy the main protagonist.<br />
<br />
The female protagonist, (Renstall, Lisara) is basically Ryosuke&#039;s master and main reason why this show has the ecchi tag which you will understand straight away after the first episode, believe me when I say that after you&#039;ve seen the first episode you will know straight away whether you will like this show or not. <br />
<br />
The minor main characters and side characters are doing a decent job so far to add to the plot and to the comedy aspect.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9; This is a high score, I know, however I will explain why. Even though this show has it&#039;s flaws and the fighting scenes have the same order of how it goes, it is still a very enjoyable show and before you know it you will have reach episode 6 which should air this week, I think. <br />
<br />
As I said many times in this review, this show has potential and I hope that they will have everything taken care of when it ends or at least make it so good that I will look forward to a season 2 if it will come out as this show can become a gem.<br />
For me personally so far, episode 1 was really well done, it will get you excited for the next episode but then it slows down a bit it will explain stuff and let&#039;s you go with the flow, but the last episode I watched today(nr.5) it will pick up some of the pace again and in between the episodes it will give hints as I stated before of some major stuff that still has to come.<br />
<br />
So in 2 sentences; Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai is a possible gem but still far from being one. It has flaws and will certainly need some work, but still very, very enjoyable.

    Like your average high school boy, Ryosuke Kaga can’t stop thinking perverted thoughts.  Unlike the average high school boy, he won’t shut up about it, and cares little for anything other than breasts, butts, breasts, napes, breasts, panties, breasts, and...  Um...  Underarms.  It makes more sense when he says it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, on his way home from school, he sees a beautiful red-haired girl standing all alone in the rain outside of his house.  Not content to just stare at her wet, transparent shirt, he offers her his umbrella, and invites her in for a change and a shower.  No sooner

          <span style="display: none;" id="review170803">
        are they indoors and alone then she begins to hold him close...  And just when he’s getting ready to ditch his V-card, she stabs him through the heart with a giant sword.<br />
<br />
As it turns out, her name is Lisara, and she’s a grim reaper...  You know, those things that were cool until Soul Eater...  And in order to complete her mission on earth, she needed to form a contract with somebody who had inexplicably high amounts of life energy...  Which Ryosuke apparently has in spades...  And she draws her power directly from the one thing that makes her new partner love his life so much.  Unfortunately for her, she finds out that he drives his passion from his perversion, so she can only be at full power when he’s popping a woody...  Which works out perfectly, because without that power, she gets her ass kicked faster than Lina Inverse on her period... Losing her clothes in the process.<br />
<br />
At first glance, you’d think this was the perfect set-up for an ecchi fanservice series...  Well, yes and no.  We’ll get to the meat of this review in a few paragraphs, but for the moment, I must give credit where credit is due.<br />
<br />
So I Can’t Play H...  Which I’ll simply be calling H from now on...  Was produced by a company called feel, and while I’d love to say some smart-sounding words about their track record and production history, I’ve never actually heard of this company before.  They’ve done in-between animation on a few shows I’ve seen, but up until now, the only show they’ve directly produced and animated that I’ve actually seen was Corpse Princess...  Which I only remember dropping out of boredom.  <br />
<br />
I can’t say anything about feel, but whatever their eternally lower-cased history may be, this show is drop dead gorgeous.  The occasional CG is breathtaking, whether it’s taking the form of a simple escalator or the teleportation field around a reaper.  This is CG rendering that even Sword Art Online would be gasping at, even if the color scheme does kind of become an eyesore in the final few episodes.  The backgrounds are exquisitely detailed, expertly framed, and they will absolutely dazzle you with their use of lighting and shading.  <br />
<br />
The animation for the characters is much simpler, but not bad by any means...  Their designs are very standard, a little on the bland side, and nowhere near as realistic as the aesthetic would have you believe... but their movement is still quite a bit more fluid than what you’d find in most shows of a similar ilk.  Key frames and speedlines are rare, but they’re used fairly well for what they are.<br />
<br />
So, when you’re talking about ecchi titles, the bar is consistently a low one...  Titty showcases aren’t typically known for having good writing, original ideas, or any value outside of the perverse.  It’s entirely possible for ecchi shows to be enjoyable outside of the skin content that they offer...  Strike Witches is a prime example of this...  But actual depth and creativity are rare elements indeed.  So why am I bringing this up, while talking about a show that’s basically just Bleach meets Girls Bravo, with an older version of Shana in the lead role?  Because, believe it or not, So I Can’t Play H came dangerously close to impressing me.  <br />
<br />
With the plot being set up the way it is, H had a potentially brilliant subversion right in the palm of it’s hand.  With Ryosuke being a hopeless pervert who values women solely for their bodies, and who’s depth of character only reaches the level of ‘I like different poses,’ and Lisara drawing her energy from that pervert power, the only thing this show had to do to have me eating out of it’s hand was to not have anybody fall in love with him.  If he was simply used as an object, as Lisara proclaimed in episode 1, then it would have been a very clever play on his habit of objectifying women.  I can take the plot at face value...  Trust me, there’s a lot worse ideas out there...  And it makes sense that, under this arrangement she’d eventually get used to being naked around him.  From there, she should have grown to see him as a necessary annoyance...  A being less than a man, who she doesn’t feel remotely threatened by, like a little kid, or a brainless dog.  In fact, the entire harem could have seen him this way, adding a surprising edge of feminism to the heaping helping of boobs that the show throws at us.<br />
<br />
And as far as the romantic aspect of H goes, this change would have also helped Ryosuke become a much better character...  He could have been emasculated by their treatment of him, faced his immature flaws, and forced himself to develop and grow in order to win more than just Lisara’s time.  I can’t even begin to describe how refreshing a dynamic this would be, and I certainly can’t express how much good will I would have had for this title.  But alas, this isn’t how things went...  Lisara’s promise to use him as a power source was nothing more than the same old cliched Tsundere bullshit that we’ve grown accustomed to.<br />
<br />
Every girl in the harem falls madly in love with this skeezwad, and he doesn’t start to show monogamous interest in anybody until the third quarter of the series, and it comes from pretty much out of nowhere, proving to the viewer that male perversion can only be overcome if a woman is willing to accept and tolerate it.  Yeah, just love that womanizing douchebag, and he’ll only have eyes for you eventually.  I wasn’t really expecting any better than that, but it would have been nice.<br />
<br />
Then again, it’s not like that message will ever reach the ears of anybody whom it could damage...  I can’t for the life of me imagine anybody enjoying this show without a bottle of lotion sitting beside them, and any negative message it sends will fly right over the heads of THAT market.<br />
<br />
Oh, and speaking of all the girls falling in love with him, the funniest thing about H by far is how little it understands human emotion...  Yeah, I know, big surprise, no harem characters are realistic.  But we’re talking about a whole other level here.  It’s not uncommon for harem girls to fall in love with the main character for no reason whatsoever, but this has to be the first anime I’ve ever seen where one of the girls doesn’t start to show an interest in him until another girl suggests it.  Yep...  No exaggeration there.  One of them says “We both like Ryosuke,” and in so many words, the other one says “I do?  Oh yeah, I do!”  And the laziest love interest in the series was born.<br />
<br />
Do I even have to mention that it gets worse than that?  There’s a reveal halfway through that’s probably one of the most bewildering anime moments I’ve seen in a long time.  Ryosuke skypes his mother for spoiler reasons, and a girl in the room asks her for some information regarding his bloodline.  She says, in so many words, “Oh, by the way, I lied about your father being dead.”  That’s it.  No hesitation, no reluctance, she just drops what should have been a ton of bricks on him out of nowhere and with not nearly enough prodding to suddenly break sixteen years of silence.  And his reaction?  Mild surprise at best.  She gives him a quick explanation, and the subject gets dropped faster than the beat at a Skrillex concert.  And no, that’s not a spoiler worthy of a warning...  I wanted it to be, as I was pretty damn sure the villain would turn out to be his father in a mask, but it never gets brought up again.  It’s even more bafflingly stupid than Ryosuke’s mental dictionary.<br />
<br />
Which reminds me...  Remember that plot I mentioned earlier?  The one I begrudgingly decided to take at face value?  Yeah, it’s about as consistent as an everlasting gobstopper.  According to the back of the DVD cover, Ryosuke can’t be perverted after Lisara’s used him for power, so he wants to help her so she can leave and his life can return to normal.  Yeah, at no point in the show is that ever true.  First of all, that’s not the reason he’s helping her...  He’s doing it because she says he only has 3 months to live, and he wants her to save him.  Second of all, he never stops being perverted...  Although even when she’s buck naked right in front of him, he has to (I wish I didn’t remember this) memorize all of the dirty words in a dictionary, so he can call any dirty word to his mind when needed.  Because it takes obsessive studying to come up with the word “Bath.”<br />
<br />
And third of all, his childhood friend makes a contract with Lisara’s childhood friend, and her passion for life comes from her love of Ryosuke...  Spoiler, yes, but you’ll figure that out long before it’s revealed.  And get this...  The exploitation of her life force NEVER causes her to stop being in love with him.  I think that’s a problem, don’t you?  That is, aside from the problem of her being in love with a skeezwad.<br />
<br />
And oh, I know what you’re thinking...  “It doesn’t matter if it’s stupid, and shamelessly puts flesh on parade despite some gaping plot holes, inhuman behavior, and elements that make absolutely no sense.  Hell, Strike Witches was a booby show, and the logic revolving around the panties makes for an incomprehensible plot hole, and you love Strike Witches!.”  Yeah, you’re right.  Strike Witches was a stupid, idiotic mess with copious amounts of bare boobs.  But you know what it wasn’t?  Pretentious.  Strike Witches was a blast from start to finish because it never tried to be anything deeper than action-packed cheesecake.  But that wasn’t enough for H.<br />
<br />
See, the story gets serious in the second half...  Well, at least it tries, but all it ends up doing is making even less sense...  And it tries it’s hand at some real drama.  I’ll spare you most of it, including Ryosuke’s uncanny transformation into a perfect gentleman the moment he gets a legitimate chance to pork somebody...  And talk about the villain’s motive, which is going to be a difficult thing to do without giving away any spoilers.  <br />
<br />
To put it in ambiguous terms, the villain’s motivation is driven by a disturbingly real threat to the very existence of life on this planet...  It’s a threat that nobody is talking about yet, as it’s even more controversial than climate change, and the people who try to take a stand against it are demonized for their efforts.  This is quite possibly the first time I’ve seen a fictional story try to tackle this issue, but as I learned before, I wasn’t expecting too much.  Ryosuke and his harem are conflicted over this issue, which seems to be far too great a necessary evil to face...  And I swear to god, the solution this story comes up with is one of the most pretentious fictional solutions I have ever heard for anything.  It’s steeped entirely in ignorance of human nature and whimsical sci-fi fantasy, which makes H feel all the more shallow and stupid for it’s efforts.  It’s like listening to a ten year old say that Israel and Palestine should just hug it out, or seeing Superman solve the world’s problems by sending all the nukes into space.  It’s a cute idea, but for the love of god, please don’t write a freaking story bout it!<br />
<br />
If I haven’t already made this clear, H is incompetent down to it’s lowest possible level.  The jokes are bad, none of the characters are likeable, the nudity is too constant and over-saturated to remain sexy for longer than the space of a single episode, and the music is made up of cookie-cutter dating sim tunes.  It’s childish and stupid down to it’s very core, and while it’s offensive to women in some very creative ways, the only thing that keeps it from becoming completely morally repulsive is the fact that the harem in question doesn’t include any incestuous or lolicon characters.  Hell, the one harem girl who’s still in junior high is also the only girl in the entire show who never does any unobscured nudity, because yeah, THAT’s going to save it at this point.  The only reason I can see anybody watching this is because of the boobs...  And if that’s enough for you, then congratulations, you’re eternally 14.<br />
<br />
So I Can’t Play H is available on DVD and Blu-ray from Sentai Filmworks.  It’s fairly expensive on most sites, but at the time this review is being written, you could get it at Rightstuf.com for 17.99 or 23.99, depending on your preferred format.  There’s no dub as of yet, but knowing Sentai, they’re probably just waiting tentatively to see if this title is popular enough to justify spending money on a dub.  It’s a shame they have the rights to it, because a show like this really belongs in the hands of Funimation.  It’s one of the few titles I’d actually LIKE to see Jamie Marchi write the script for.  <br />
<br />
The DVD doesn’t include the final thirteenth OVA episode, and while that omission may be a completionist’s nightmare, I really think it’s better to just pretend that episode doesn’t exist.  Why?  Well, remember all those female characters that you’ve already seen naked in every possible form of undress, and from every possible angle that won’t violate Japan’s decency laws?  Well, the final episode is a swimsuit competition!  Yeah, that’s exactly what this show needed!  No, I don’t want to learn more about the villain, or the whereabouts of Ryosuke’s dad, or the societal results of this show’s idiotic conclusion...  I wanna see my fetishes catered to even harder and more gratuitously than before, in an episode that isn’t even a tenth as well animated as the series that preceded it.  <br />
<br />
So, as worthless as this show is, I can’t really call it the bottom of the barrel.  The animation, quite frankly, is too beautiful for that.  But it’s close.  And keep in mind, the ecchi genre dwells in a barrel that’s every bit as deep as the Mariana trench, and it’s bottom is littered with even more despicable 1/10(or below) titles like Dears, Eiken, Love Love, Popotan, and Master of Martial Hearts.  H is floating just a few feet above those titles, and about a dozen feet below School Days.  That’s not a place any anime wants to be...  Trust me, it’s really cold and dark down there, but it’s where this title belongs, and I can’t wait to post this review and instantly go about the task of forgetting about it.  I give So I Can’t Play H a 2/10.

    Dakura Boku wa, H ga Dekinai is basically your run of the mill, standard echhi anime. While this anime is by no means terrible it is simply mediocre at best. The story was promising at times but the plot was never sufficiently explored for me to care too much. The animation was pretty good but thats to be expected. The soundtrack is by far the best part of the anime, as the opening and ending are both outstanding. The characters........ This is where Dakura Boku wa, H ga Dekinai falls flat on it&#039;s face, of all the characters i only like one, The main character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review151255">
        here is extraordinarily bland and quite frankly a bore to watch, The main heroine is cliche and mostly uninteresting and most of the others are the same. So overall while i enjoyed this anime at times the story and the characters made this unable to be anything but mediocre <br />
6/10 if anything listen to the op and ed of this show as they are fantastic

    Haters of the ecchi genre or people who do not want to be accused watching porn, please skip this review and check other reviews out because this anime is all about boobs. Boobs are everywhere is this anime! Right, I&#039;m going straight into what I feel about this anime.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Honestly, the plot in this anime is terribly boring. The whole anime is centred around this death goddess searching for the most powerful energy source in this world. Of course, obstacles appeared and they overcame it and that&#039;s all.  They actually spend about 9 episodes or so searching for that energy source. Pretty boring to me

          <span style="display: none;" id="review106607">
        as it was sort of draggy. To be really honest, if the characters didn&#039;t display their body aspect to such extent, I would&#039;ve dropped this anime long ago. Also, this anime focus far too much on the body aspect of the characters that made me forget I was actually watching an anime and felt more like I was watching porn. I&#039;m not exaggerating but almost every few minutes, there will be someone&#039;s body being featured, naked. Therefore, due to the boring plot and the over-emphasise of the character&#039;s body, the story was not really brought into my mind.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
The characters all have sufficient time in this anime. There wasn&#039;t a case of a particular character being left out after being introduced for a few minutes only. Hence, the appearing time for the characters was rather balanced. Additionally, you might want to pay attention to Lisara only as all other females are a pain in the eye. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Nothing to comment on the sound because it has little significance in the anime. I totally forgot the existence of a OST in this anime. However, the opening was catchy and impressive.  <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
If we are talking about the art in terms of the body art of the characters, it normal like any other ecchi animes. Nothing really special or unusual about the body art here.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I decided to watch this anime because I had nothing else to watch, hoping this anime could at least entertain me a little. However, the plot was plainly boring and there was an over-emphasise on the character&#039;s body which disappointed me a lot. I know this is an ecchi anime, but there has to be a limit to the amount of time spent showing us the bodies of the characters. So basically, this anime was not very enjoyable to me. If the plot was a little more interesting  it might actually turn out to be a very enjoyable anime. Therefore, I would strongly advise you to not spend too much time in this anime because it might turn out to be a waste of time for you because it is really terribly boring. <br />
<br />
Thank you.

    I watched this because someone recommended it, with the bold statement &#039;It&#039;s better than Highschool DxD!&#039; I am a massive DxD fan, of both the anime and the LN series. Challenge Accepted. <br />
Upon completion of this I realized that that recommendation was done by someone who was either A) High or B) Hadn&#039;t actually seen DxD. <br />
This anime doesn&#039;t hold a candle to it.<br />
Not to say, if you like your usual action/fanservice fapfest, that isn&#039;t watchable.<br />
<br />
Story - 6<br />
I got the feeling, from watching this, that there was a decent story in there somewhere but it was garbled and disjointed. Unfortunately I think it fell prey

          <span style="display: none;" id="review99171">
        to that age old enemy of Good Plots.... Fanservice. Maybe if I watch it again and ignore all the bouncing boobies it might make a little more sense. Easier said than done though.<br />
<br />
Art - 8 <br />
Can&#039;t complain about the art. It&#039;s very easy on the eyes. <br />
<br />
Sound - 5<br />
Got to give the sound an ambiguous 5. I can&#039;t actually remember any of it.<br />
<br />
Characters - 8 <br />
The main and the heroine are the reason for an 8 here. I had to give them credit for not pussyfooting around. If I say anymore, it&#039;ll probably be considered spoilers so I&#039;m going to hush up. <br />
I usually have a pretty good memory for interesting/unique anime characters and none of the rest of them stick out particularly vividly, which pretty much says it all in my book.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 7 <br />
Yeah, OK I enjoyed it. But then again I&#039;m too easily amused by boob-power. I&#039;m still a 14 year old at heart.<br />
<br />
Overall - 7<br />
It definitely feels like it could have been the successor to DxD in my opinion. It&#039;s disappointing it doesn&#039;t really live up to it though and it falls into the pitfalls that many anime of this category do. .<br />
Pleasing visuals and two characters that fit my personal preferences make up for a so-so storyline and forgettable secondary characters.<br />
This anime is definitely more for someone who is between series or who wants to just kill a bit of time with something generic from the ecchi/harem genre. It&#039;s not selling the genre to newcomers that for sure.

    NOTE: Again, this review is only based on the anime. I haven&#039;t read both the light novel and the manga.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Some grammar check and minor addition of content. My opinion regarding the anime still remains the same.<br />
<br />
After I and my ecchi-addicted friend watched the first episode of &quot;Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai&quot; (which we simply watched since I saw it here on MAL that it&#039;s like High School DxD), we both know that there&#039;s no sparks out there, trying to hook us - its watchers - to get into the anime. Despite that, we still continued to watch the anime. Although finishing the anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review98281">
        could be rewarding, I doubt that most people will have enough patience to last that long, with the anime&#039;s first four episodes not deviating from the usual ecchi anime formula, (with the clothes melting off and &quot;OOH, BOOBS!!!&quot;) and the laughs simply not enough.<br />
<br />
The male lead character, Ryousuke, is also your usual male lead character: a lecherous wimp of a teenager (though he gains some sort of powers, the first one - making him regain ero-energy - I find cheesy ). At least I find Lisara, the female lead, a good character, serving as a foil to the pervert Ryousuke.<br />
<br />
The art and character design is very much similar to High School DxD. Not that I have any complaints about it since it actually looks nice and all.<br />
<br />
What made the first four episodes &quot;lacking in sparks&quot; is that 1) the first episode basically showed all of Lisara&#039;s powers as a shinigami, and 2) the following episodes follows the usual plot developments of the usual ecchi anime, which has become, simply put, predictable and bland. By that time, some - if not most - of its viewers would&#039;ve dropped the series, thinking that it shouldn&#039;t take half of the series&#039; worth of episodes to get them hooked to the anime (unless all they&#039;re looking forward to is more boobs, that is).<br />
<br />
The latter half of the anime features a genre shift from mostly ecchi/harem to more of action (although the fan service still is there), and by this point until the last episodes (which features another genre shift to romance), the story actually starts to have an identity of its own (and also, more sense to comprehend). <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this anime&#039;s problem - overall - is that it plays safe and by doing so, it actually became something that is trite and banal, so if you&#039;re going to watch this seeing that it&#039;s like another (albeit inferior version of) High School DxD. If, on the other hand, you haven&#039;t seen much ecchi in your whole life (or you simply just wants boobs, boobs and more boobs in your anime), then perhaps you might just enjoy this one.

    If you were to take the classic, quiet girl with a large chest with a crush on the MC since they were kids; the large-chested foil who wants the MC just because; the moderate-chested girl who learns to love the perverted antics of the MC, and the clear romantic interest with a small chest and a tsundere personality, and add a moderate-bust sized cold killer, that&#039;d be the entire female cast of the show. (I typically don&#039;t define anime girls by their bust size, but in this series, the screentime on just their faces and just their busts are about equal.) Throw in the perverted

          <span style="display: none;" id="review129161">
        MC who has a power everyone wants and that&#039;s the story in a nutshell.<br />
<br />
I watched the entire series because I read a review that said it got better after episode 6, I think it got better at episode 5, but (at least for me) it didn&#039;t keep on getting better to a level that was enjoyable.<br />
<br />
The art is good, not great. The sound is not really memorable (but to be fair, that&#039;s a critique I have with most non-music series). The characters are walking cliches. If you like seeing the same scene of a girl being held up by tentacle-like things as her clothes fade away, followed by the MC getting a magical power up and saving the day (repeatedly during the course of the series), then you&#039;ll probably like this show. <br />
<br />
The story ends so thoroughly in 12 episodes that you&#039;re pretty sure there wasn&#039;t much to the story to begin with.

    Great anime.<br />
<br />
Full of comedy,  romance, action, and tits.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
I&#039;m not even going to waste my time explaining the plot. Just know that it&#039;s great, and the first few episodes are basically intros for the characters. It might be hard to stay on-board (It&#039;s well worth it!), but know that after all the characters are revealed, this show takes off into greatness.<br />
This anime shifts gears mid-story and steers from comedy ecchi towards a more serious tone. It matures very well yet still retains its &quot;fun&quot;.<br />
The only predictable things in this anime are the fight scenes in the first few episodes, afterwards nothing is obvious and it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review168419">
        will keep you guessing.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound<br />
Art and sound are perfectly fine. The action sequences and romance scenes had great songs/music playing in the background.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
The main characters are great and developed with sense. I don&#039;t understand why people hate stereotypes. If there is a stereotype for each type of character, they&#039;re obviously going to be the same as any other show? That&#039;s like hating an anime that doesn&#039;t kill off the main character because an older anime didn&#039;t kill of the main character either.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment <br />
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. I just finished watching all 12 episodes literally 15 minutes ago<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
Seriously, this show had me laughing hard as hell (ep. 5, perfect). Action was there but you can tell it&#039;s not the main focus, but still fulfilling. Romance, I&#039;ve always loved romance/love stories and this show was put together very well, it&#039;s a harem as well and the main character chooses one (which I love to see). If I was a true man I could have cried at a few moments in this show.<br />
<br />
Just a perfect anime.

    This is a pretty good show, kinda weak, but still pretty good. It follows this guy whos an extreme pervert and the death god (female of course) that he lives with.<br />
This show is one of those where the writers might have gotten a little out of control with their rights. I mean the whole basis is that the death god cant live on earth without replenishing energy so she decides to make a contract where she can suck his energy out. Thing is, for him to energize himself (heres where the fanserve comes into play) he has to be turned on/horny/have a raging boner etc.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review84537">
        and to accomplish this he basically runs around copping a feel on anyone he sees and meanwhile there is supposed to be some touching romance story going on in the background... btw this is kinda a harem in a sense. Even better is the fact that the girls&#039; clothing is like a meter for how much energy they have left, for instance if one uses a big attack, or something happens to deplete a large bit of energy, her clothes disapear... granted they start out in spandex so really its not like we couldnt already see everything anyway...<br />
Oh and i cant believe i didnt bring this up till now, but the main guy is going to die. That is why he agreed to help the death god because she said if he did she&#039;d save his life when his time inevitably comes in 3 months. <br />
To keep shit interesting there are some fight scenes, betrayals, a big showdown, a near-apocalyptic disaster, and a friggin ton of titty flashes. Everything culminates in the final episode (as it does in most anime) and it was that episode (wont talk about it for spoilers) that took my opinion of this show from okay to pretty good. Honestly I had no idea how it was going to end until it was over and thats just how I like it to be.

    Since your probably reading this just to test the waters for Dakara Boku wa, H ga Denkinai, I&#039;m going to keep this review short.<br />
<br />
*MAL ratings are broken as helllll<br />
<br />
Overall, this ecchi anime is perfect.It is comedic, cute, exciting and unlike most, this actually has a story and i&#039;snt a harem. All the characters are as believable as they can get in a 12 episode ecchi. Keep in mind that this is a casual anime, it&#039;s not a work of art but it is at its core, a ball of fun and has actually pretty decent romance. Also its not stupidly ero or ridiculous so it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review105121">
        does have a slight &quot;realistic&quot; feeling to it. <br />
*I wish this anime was extended!!!<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story flows well, although it was a bit slow at the beginning, most animes are, in order to set the story and introduce the everyone. It will actually make you feel something which is something alot of ecchi&#039;s fail to do, and you most likely continue watching because of the story, gags and romance.<br />
<br />
ERO-yske:<br />
This leads me to the ecchi/fanservice/ero component, the ero in this anime is actually more of a necessity to forming the premise of the anime, as unbelievable as that is. Meaning the most of the screen time you see that is ecchi, is justified. That being said there honestly isnt that much nudity but definitely enough to satisfy.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art is pretty good, maybe slightly above average. The detail is there, and it is enough to convey the feelings of the characters, and it will definitely have an &quot;effect&quot; on you during the ero segments. There is fighting involved, and it is actually well animated. The character designs were interesting and quite attractive, few with multicoloured/gradient hair.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Not much to say, the OP and ED were okay and fit the anime. The voice actors were pretty decent, so really don&#039;t take much notice. Also no really annoying high voices, so that&#039;s good.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
The premise of each character, were more than solid enough for this short series and because of this, I wish this series was longer. They could easily expand on all of the characters involved mainly Lisara. But excluding all that, they were believable and well thought through.<br />
<br />
-Main Characters:<br />
 As for Ryosuke, while being a teenage boy that opening expresses his love for the female form, he is the ideal guy you see in animes. Weak at first but determined, eventually becoming stronger and protecting the weak(girls). <br />
<br />
 As for Lisara, she has a rough, or rather responsible exterior, is capable and cute when she gets embarrassed. She could maybe even a little be considered a tsundere <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
It&#039;s a fun series, with a storyline, and a decent romance, what more can you ask for. 10/10<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
8-9/10 || This couldve been something awesome. The ecchi is really a side dish to the whole anime (Which is great).

    Recently I was out of anime to watch and was looking for a few of them and came across Dakara boku wa H ka dekinai. I heard a lot of praise especially for it&#039;s second half and as I was dropping anime quite a lot here and there I thought about giving a shot and let&#039;s just say it didn&#039;t go well for me...<br />
<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
<br />
At best I could describe the anime as &quot;border to hell&quot; with a 2. That&#039;s the most I could ever give it for the story section. Call me wierd, but I am very particular about a plot in an Ecchi anime,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267421">
        so I went in with DxD-like expectations and got severely disappointed, and sadly there were a whole long list of reasons apart from that which made me hate the show as well.  I&#039;ll go step-by-step, since the anime itself was divided into two parts, I divided my story section into two parts for easy understanding.<br />
<br />
The first six episodes are basically plotless and contribute zilch to the plot, it&#039;s just ecchi and more excuses for more ecchi. Characters being introduced in a cliched manner and wasted exactly HALF the anime in it. You might bring up the excuse and say &quot;but that was fanservice for the fans, it&#039;s Ecchi, it has to have it&quot;. Well, sadly this anime itself couldn&#039;t decide so who am I to judge. It was a harem in second, then pointless Ecchi in the next, and then weak plot. The studio couldn&#039;t even decide WHAT to follow for the first half and made me think as if the studio just licensed an anime and opened the reference books a few days before the airing date. Thankfully I went past the tortious first half and the end of episode six revealed that the next half (un)fortunately will focus on a proper plot (made you think the studio finally got their hands straight didn&#039;t they? Wrong.<br />
<br />
The second half was something that was praised a lot by other reviewers and watchers, not to mention people said the ending was excellent, so I forced myself through the first half and trudged on to the next episodes, what did I get? A bunch of zilch in return. In the most basic sense this anime tried to pull off a Hyoudou Issei DxD-esque rescue-person-in-another-world plotline and let&#039;s just say much like the rest of the anime, they ruined it. Plain and simple. A cliched villain, ***MINOR SPOILER: whom we don&#039;t see the face of at all, for no absolute reason...END SPOILER*** a cliched adventure, a cliched set of pointless fanservice yet again (that excuse won&#039;t work anymore my friend, this half was plot-time, and a whole lot of plot holes. If you compare the amount of plot holes in this anime to a beggar&#039;s clothes only 2 times out of 10 will the beggar&#039;s clothes have more holes than this plot, which by the way is the score this anime deserves for a terrible story line. I&#039;ll end with a weak joke, it was &quot;a border to hell&quot;. There you go, obligatory hell joke in anime about hell is obligatory.<br />
<br />
Art: 3/10<br />
<br />
I think I know why I immediately understood who the studio was because it was a mess as usual from Studio feel. The familiar washed-out artstyle and horrible effects immediately pointed feel. toward me and I wasn&#039;t surprised that I was right (although I was kind of surprised). Going in detail on those aforementioned reasons, even at 720p it looked washed-out. This is a familiar tactic used by the lazy art directors at feel. and I remember this clearly since SNAFU S2 where they ruined an excellent artstyle (courtesy Brain&#039;s Base for the excellent first season) and that was seen here as well. As for the effects, the characters had to perform action sequences and throw spells at each other, those required effects at a good level and feel underdelivered. They looked like something a rookie would make, no joke. It looked terrible to be honest and the washed-out artstyle made it even worse. And don&#039;t get me started on that horribly lazy tactic used in between episodes 9 to 11 as a green background almost everywhere to save time and be more lazy. As for character design, I can say that was the saving grace of this section and if not for the character design, it would&#039;ve gotten a one, once again no joke. You can clearly see some effort (perhaps the only effort) out into the art into the characters. They looked vibrant, cheery and better than the rest of the art section in general. I personally like the shades of colours used for everyone, especially Quele, Lisara and Iria. Other than that... Well nothing positive so let&#039;s end here.<br />
<br />
Sound. 4/10<br />
<br />
At best I could describe the sound section as decent. Apart from that massively forgettable OP/ED (although I must admit later on the ED was kinda catchy, but kinda) the OST too couldn&#039;t figure itself out. You won&#039;t believe me if I tell you that the sound changed EVERY episode. Not a good sign when you&#039;ve got sub-par story and art scores. The VAs more or less did their job decently which is why I&#039;ve given a 4 and not a 2. On the other hand like I said the OST was a mess, especially the BGM. <br />
<br />
Character: 1/10<br />
<br />
Woah, this is the first time I&#039;ve ever used 1s 2s and maybe 3s in a review ever. Well, I can say that the characters were promising at first but it&#039;s what happened to then later which made me give them this outrageous number. They took that potential and threw it down the garbage and shoved it down your throat. If you want an easy example to understand through, this is it. I&#039;m already severely disappointed in TsunDeres and our Rias Gremory wannabe Lisara Rest-whatever was a painfully bad TsunDere. Apart from being a 99.9% Tsun, that .01% came through in the last Episodes and if you think that&#039;s enough to make me change my mind, well you&#039;re sadly mistake.I still can&#039;t believe what made people think that ending was any good. Personally I&#039;d be glad if it went the way of the &quot;bad guys&quot; since that way I could have been a bit more generous in my scoring but then this HAD to go the typical Shounen route. Anyway, speaking of Shounen, we move to Erosuke, I mean Ryousuke, unlike Hyoudou Issei, this guy was a hilarious attempt at a pervert MC. Forget about his cliched energy, the way he got his power among many other things made me feel like banging my head on a table. As for the denseness, a thing noticed in many romance anime, well I can say this sole reason is the one I&#039;m giving a 1 and not none. As for the other jokes we move to our onee-sama cliche &#039;imouto&#039;, Quele. I rooted for her throughout the anime (I moved on from Mina due to reasons I&#039;ll detail later) but then after that pathetic fanservice scene in the second half I LOATHED her as well. Mina was a character I instantly liked at first, but like this anime, my support for her crumbled faster than the plot did. She was too damn shy to be supported anywhere in the course of the anime. It was painfully obvious at the start who would win in the end. As for our other character who was brutally pushed to the side, Iria. She was your basic &quot;rival&quot; archetype and that didn&#039;t please me at all (even in that way if you take it). There was nothing about her that wasn&#039;t cliched. &#039;Nuff said. She wasn&#039;t even the breast character in the anime (apologies for the pun), which puts her appeal to the maximum of 0.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/10<br />
<br />
Yes, the characters were horrible, yes the artstyle was washed out, yes the story was cliche as hell. But yet there was something that made me watch this anime and not dropping it, perhaps it was the way the after-credits scene was handled after each episode, or because I was dropping too many anime, or more likely both. As for the fanservice part, it was absolutely fulfilled, although I&#039;d love some reasons as to why it happens, heck, even half an excuse would work (such as Yuuki Rito&#039;s antigravity control, just kidding). I may sound positive but in the end it was almost worthwhile watching the anime.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2.6 (Averaged)<br />
<br />
Breaking the record for my lowest rated review, Dakara boku wa H ka dekinai takes the top cake as my worst reviewed anime ever. If you&#039;re in it for the plot, you&#039;ll be disappointed, if you&#039;re expecting some character development, you&#039;re an idiot (apologies for being rude), if you&#039;re in here for the Ecchi, well most of you will be satisfied. I was very surprised that this anime was praised for it&#039;s last arc and the last episode because frankly I ironically found the first half almost understandable than the second half which was a mess and a failed copy of DxD. On a personal note, it yet again disappointed me as a TsunDere fan since Lisara takes my award for the worst character of the anime. Period. All in all, this is an anime which you&#039;ll be forgiven if avoided and rewarding if you love ecchi with no plot and just oppai, although I must admit, it might be a fake too. I&#039;m honestly half surprised at the score the anime ended up with. I expected a little more, maybe 4 but at 2.6 it makes me laugh a little. To be frankly honest with you ***SPOILER: If the end was tragic, perhaps I&#039;d be a bit more considerate and I thought about this throughout the anime, and sadly it didn&#039;t happen. It took the pathetic harem route with no meaning to it, it didn&#039;t even try making up an excuse for the ending...<br />
<br />
P.S: After such a disgraceful score I don&#039;t think I have a waifu for the waifu corner. All I can say is that Caesar is the best character of the anime. That&#039;s it. Goodbye. No waifu corner. This anime doesn&#039;t deserve one.

    First off i want to make clear that the synopsis of this anime couldn&#039;t be more wrong than the way it is written on this site. Having said this, I&#039;ll write a proper one as it&#039;s technically the plot.<br />
<br />
Story 8 / 10<br />
Ryosuke Kaga is a 2nd year student at Momozomo Academy. He&#039;s a extreme fan of erotica, and praises women for their bodies and believes them to be treasures. He&#039;s kind to every girl and shows concern, However he has the habit of speaking his mind out loud and his reputation as a pervert grows everyday, As he not only compliments girls good looks, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review132733">
        also emphasizes on how they&#039;re erotic and creeps out every girl in sight.<br />
<br />
 One day on his way back home he sees a petite red haired beauty standing right outside his house on the middle of the rain, He however can&#039;t allow this so he&#039;s corteus to her and invites her in his home. This girl however is a pro at what she does, As it just happens, She is a &quot;Shinigami&quot; or a Death Goddess, At least that&#039;s what she call her self, As Ryosuke was prepared to make his move, She stabs him with half of a blade that allows her to make contracts and temporal contracts with humans to sustain her existence on the human world as for any visitor from &quot;Grimwald&quot; her world. <br />
<br />
Ryosuke can dissolve the contract at any time, and at first he&#039;s reluctant to believe what she is, That&#039;s before they&#039;re attacked by organism that belong to her world, She begins to fight the organism and takes some of  his energy and quickly defeats it.<br />
<br />
 Lisara Restall is the Grim Reaper name, Her world is suffering an energy shortage and her mission is to find &quot;The One&quot; a human capable of producing unfathomable amount of energy that would benefit her world greatly and mission.<br />
<br />
 Ryosuke as i said can back out, But then she releases shocking news,She Possesses the ability to knows how long people have left to live just by looking, Ryosuke has only 3 months left to live, Now if he helps her, She can use &quot;The Ones&quot; energy to renew his life, Or he could perv out and wait for his for his number to be called. Peoples energy usually comes from a driving force, His is erotism, Now every time she uses his energy he will be incapable of getting excited &quot;Downstairs&quot; for a time. Things never stay business between a hot reaper and a perv human partner, Things tend to tangle and along the way many things happen.<br />
<br />
Art 9 / 10<br />
The art is above average and smooth. Very enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Sound 8 / 10<br />
The voice actors are very good and the sound tracks are very much on point.<br />
<br />
Characters 8 / 10<br />
Very developed and enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8 / 10<br />
<br />
I enjoyed this anime very much, I&#039;d recommend it to anyone out there that enjoys the Ecchi Genre with some romance.<br />
<br />
Overall 9 / 10 <br />
<br />
The anime itself it&#039;s great, A lot of ideas. It portrays a relationship that start as business and end up in romance. This anime is very serious on story line, It makes good use of Fan Service and the expected &quot;Ecchi&quot;, This saddly cripples the story as for some of the material used in this anime, Was needed if it were to be a extended anime, The only mistake here is that they tried to fit way to much in such short space.<br />
<br />
 I&#039;m certain that in a 24Ep anime this would have been quite the anime, But on my view this cramping dropped it to an (9). Which is the overall i&#039;m giving the anime. Why an (9), Well you gotta be made of STONE to no like this anime, It has a little bit of everything, So much that what you find lacking, It another quality fills the gap and continuously keep going, With proper Comedy, Drama, Ecchiness, Harem, Romance that rotate back and forth and fill up the gaps.
