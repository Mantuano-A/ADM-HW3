    Sometimes, it’s just easy to be tricked by an anime’s potential. Judging by the premise, this show sounded like your typical, generic light novel adaptation. And you’d be right. It isn’t masking its potential in any way or form. Sadly, that means it’s exactly you’d expect: a military fantasy of mediocrity.<br />
<br />
Our Last Crusade or The Rise of a New World tells the story of a young man named Iska, caught in between a conflict involving the Heavenly Empire and the Nebulis Sovereignty. To put it simply, they are two sides with different ideologies and even utilizes different tactics as part of its culture. The Heavenly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369402">
        Empire relies on its advanced technology while the Nebulis Sovereignty utilizes its magic users. It’s a conflict of science vs magic, a common trend in military fiction. What makes this anime mediocrity relies the ultimate execution of the show’s ideas.<br />
<br />
I remember the first time when the trailers and promotional material debuted. It became obvious why the anime is designed with such a way to pit two important characters together. Iska and Alicelise (Alice) represents the opposite spectrum of an ongoing war. Peace is a far cry from being achieved although it appears that both characters desires the war to end. Fate designates their encounter and from the first episode, the two unlikely characters builds a peculiar relationship throughout the rest of the show. <br />
<br />
It would appear based on narratives and plot elements that the war has been lasting for a very long time. In the present timeline, the show sell itself as a military fantasy story. The nations have their factions, politics, and ongoing plans to achieve their goals. Iska is the powerful swordsman with near unrivaled skills from the Heavenly Empire. Meanwhile, there’s Alice, the Ice Calamity Witch with powerful ice magic at her disposal, serving the Nebulis Sovereignty. After their first encounter, we see the two continuously bumping into each other. This later turns their relationship into a complicated angle due to their conflicting ideals and alliances. However, this show does little to actually build their relationship. There’s a lack of character development as the two personalities are too contrasting to be compatible. Furthermore, it’s hard to get invested into either character when their roles are so blend. Both Iska and Alice has an honorable personality but can be deadly on the battlefield. It appears throughout the show, neither of their personality really change except when interacting between each other. Even then, it’s poorly executed especially from Alice’s point of view. In later episodes, she shows more vulnerable sides of herself that melts some of her Ice Queen persona. Meanwhile, Iska follows his moral code like a good little soldier although he isn’t afraid to take risks when needed. This includes taking on fights on the fly or trying to outsmart a battle maid like Rin, Alice’s personal bodyguard.<br />
<br />
Are you hopeful for a memorable supporting cast? If so, I got some depressing news to deliver. The supporting cast is made up of some of the most generic and poorly written characters I’ve seen this year. Rin, Nene, Mismis, and Jhin are a few examples that absolutely lacks any sort of decent characterization or development. To be honest, if you remove most of these characters, you wouldn’t feel too much impact from the anime’s storytelling altogether. It’s mostly rely on Iska and Alice to carry this anime on their back but unfortunately, they couldn’t live up to the expectations. The antagonists are even more forgettable such as Salinger, who is introduced with little buildup. In fact, it’s hard for me to say there’s any important antagonists besides the show being an enemy of itself. Yes, this anime’s weakness is itself, being that it’s so poorly designed that it’s nearly damn unwatchable.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the only saving grace is the artistic visuals. I’m not going to lie, Alice can be an eye candy to look at with her beautiful red dress, graceful blonde hair, and alluring eyes. Iska on the other hand looks like your average Kirito-clone you can find in any light novel. The world setting opens up some chances for redemption but overall still remains lackluster with the war being the main emphasis. <br />
<br />
No, this isn’t a solid show or even close. It can’t hold itself together when the plot is so lackluster with a poorly constructed main cast. I wonder when the anime adaptation was announced, it was an attempt to get the audience to drop money for the light novels. Keeping my fingers crossed, I hoped to be proven wrong but after these dreadful 12 episodes, my hope was lost. This anime is a lost cause and has no redemption.

    The power of coincidences is very interesting, but what if it was powered up to the point that it strengthens bonds between two people?<br />
<br />
I&#039;m sure that almost everyone knows what Romeo and Juliet is. It&#039;s one of the most recognizable and popular works of literature known to mankind. As what people would already know, it&#039;s about a boy named Romeo and a girl named Juliet whose families are in conflict with each other, and after their deaths, the Montague and Capulet families stopped their feud. That premise is basically what happens in Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou, Aruiwa Sekai ga Hajimaru Seisen. We

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369681">
        have two factions: the Empire and the Nebulis Sovereignty. The Empire and the Nebulis Sovereignty have been at war for more than a century. In those factions, we have our protagonist for each side. For the Empire, we have the swordsman Iska who looks like Kazuto Kirigaya, and for the Sovereignty, we have the ice princess Aliceliese &quot;Alice&quot; Lou Nebulis IX. Both of our protagonists desire to end this pointless war, meeting each other by fate, and as time passes by, their relationship seems to develop. Similar to Romeo and Juliet? Of course, but it has magic. A total rip-off? Debatable. Boring? Absolutely not.<br />
<br />
You see, I have been dreaming about this kind of premise for a while now. One might call it cliched, and I&#039;m not going to deny that. I have been looking for the kind of anime: rivals and enemies becoming acquaintances and possibly budding into romance. As the story gets developed, we have the power of coincidences that seem to link Iska and Alice together wherever they may go. Cheesy? Maybe. Interesting? Absolutely. I noticed that the story development is kind of slow, with the series picking up about halfway where we finally see things happen. Of course, I understand this. After all, ending a war does not happen overnight. I think that the story is on the right track and is developing itself properly, but it&#039;s still not enough, considering that there are still many things that need to be answered. Twelve episodes are too few to give a satisfactory conclusion. Nevertheless, I still want to see more.<br />
<br />
The first thing that I noticed immediately after watching the first episode is that the characters seem to have their eyes drawn with a similar fashion to a Geass from Code Geass, although it&#039;s black. I don&#039;t mind the similarity, in fact, I actually like it. I kept thinking, what would happen if someone actually used a Geass there and controlled someone&#039;s mind? I actually wouldn&#039;t mind if Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou, Aruiwa Sekai ga Hajimaru Seisen actually ripped off that concept, although I would probably be worried if it gets used too often. <br />
<br />
Eyes aside, the magic used by astral mages, especially the ice magic (got it?) by Alice was as beautiful as she is. The freezing chill that permeates the screen made me feel cold, although I think that only happened to me. One more, by Alice&#039;s maid Rin, and her earth magic was also spot-on. The action scenes weren&#039;t something to be scoffed at either, the animation was pretty fluid. If I am allowed to be more selfish, I would want more of the series&#039; magical display.<br />
<br />
When we&#039;re talking about Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou, Aruiwa Sekai ga Hajimaru Seisen&#039;s music, especially its opening and ending themes, I really remember that beat that gave me a very good first impression about the anime, especially Kaori Ishihara&#039;s &quot;Against.&quot; which was the OP (although I kind of admit I missed this when I was playing animemusicquiz once). Moreover, Sora Amamiya&#039;s performance of the ending song &quot;Koori no Torikago&quot; was spectacular as well, especially that refrain that really hits you in the chest on how relatable the lyrics are to the theme of the show.<br />
<br />
Itsuka oozora he hanatsu sono hi made (Until the day I let it go to the sky)<br />
kanarazu tadoritsuku hi made (Until the day that it surely arrives)<br />
tsuyoku arou dakara dou ka (Please be strong)<br />
anata mo akiramezu ni ite (Don&#039;t give up)<br />
<br />
That song really hits the spot. And of course, until our protagonists really do achieve their goal of world peace, they should remain strong and never give up. And yes, I also missed this once in AMQ. Am I a fake fan now?<br />
<br />
Maybe one point that you can take to remember the characters is that the anime is similar to Romeo and Juliet. Personally, however, I do not like thinking that way. Iska and Alice are great characters especially that the plot of the power of coincidences revolve around them. One goes here, and they meet the other. I will never get tired of a premise like that. Their character development is lacking, yes, and I cannot deny that, because there are still more things to explore about their relationship and like what I have said earlier, I am looking forward to seeing their characters develop more... if we actually get to.<br />
<br />
In Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou, Aruiwa Sekai ga Hajimaru Seisen, I have two notable favorite characters. First would be Alice&#039;s maid, Rin. Her personality is so uptight like what you see in many anime, but that&#039;s exactly why I like her. A pulchritudinous maid who wants to abide by the rules that she gets so pragmatic when it comes to violations… I mean, who doesn&#039;t want that? Pardon that deep word, if you please, something like &quot;beautiful&quot; couldn&#039;t possibly describe Rin. Second would be Sisbell Lou Nebulis IX, Alice&#039;s sister. Her being the underdog in what could possibly be a love triangle is something that makes me want to root for her. I&#039;m on team Sisbell on this one.<br />
<br />
Like what I have been saying earlier, I hope that my enjoyment is already palpable. Yes, I truly enjoyed the show, while at times I was frustrated because I was wanting to say something like &quot;why don&#039;t Iska&#039;s friends already know that he and Alice are acquaintances? Like please, let them all be allies already! I want to see the combined forces of Alice and Iska as they bring about world peace!&quot; I get more frustrated as I continue to realize that things do not happen that fast. Because of this, I still enjoyed Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou, Aruiwa Sekai ga Hajimaru Seisen.<br />
<br />
In conclusion to this review, overall, the anime has a cliched premise but it still managed to make me interested. Not just any kind of interest, however. I want to know more. I want to know what happens between the Empire and the Sovereignty as their war continues. I want to know whether Iska and Alice&#039;s last crusade will change the world. I want to know if the main enemy would just be the two warring nations. I want to see more of Rin and Sisbell. I want to see more of the anime&#039;s characters. I want to see a second season for Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou, Aruiwa Sekai ga Hajimaru Seisen.<br />

To put it simply, our last crusade is a collection of bits and pieces from other animes ( be them good or awful ), mashed together in the most disgusting way possible and vomited on an already dirty plate. In other words, an omlette made out of leftovers from fate powers, rent-a-girlfriend trash tropes, SAO main characters, *insert any silver link isekai* worldbuilding and so on. <br />
<br />
We have :<br />
- a tsundere female gilgamesh,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361780">
        which can apparently use unlimited blade works and rho aias. <br />
- your average kirito.<br />
- a fully-fledged mary sue set of protagonists. <br />
- fantasy setting, but not because there&#039;s any creativity involved, but simply because having swords, magic and random words in an non-existent language might be catchy for some people. <br />
- a long list of cliche tropes, such as ( but not limited to ) :<br />
<br />
A. Female and male MC randomly stumbling upon each other numerous times;<br />
B. Righteous, morally correct, black haired dual wielder male MC;<br />
C. Airhead loli who&#039;s only purpose is to bounce her breasts ( namely, the captain of the team who *quote* is a mediocre strategist and solider, but helps the team in other ways. Because that&#039;s what you need from a war squad captain. Gogo main character ! ^_^ );<br />
D. Female and male char. Saying the same thing, at the same time, over and over and over again, to demonstrate that it’s not a coincidence, but a strong connection.<br />
E. Random cheerful girl who&#039;s all over the male MC;<br />
F. Serious guy who&#039;s only there to create a contrast for the male MC, in case there wasn&#039;t enough emphasis on his qualities;<br />
G. Both male / female MCs being, ofc, the most prodigy of prodigies the world has ever seen.  <br />
H. Both male and female MC have the exact same tastes, since the plot demands that they get along SO WELL. <br />
You get the idea. <br />
<br />
Now that we got past the introduction, let&#039;s begin with the actual thing. Note that there are spoilers ahead. <br />
<br />
1. Plot - 1/10. <br />
<br />
The story of our last crusade takes place in a fantasy universe where two factions, namely, the empire ( consisting of humans ) and the witches are at war. Why? Because the show needed an intrigue. The shows beings roughly 100 years after the outbreak of war, and the action revolves around 2 characters, Iska, the strongest solider in the human empire - except he&#039;s not. He just has 2 beyond over powered swords. One which can apparently nullify any magic. Imagine being a witch and fighting against that with magic. The second main character is Alice, a direct descendant of Nebulis, the most powerful witch in the world. As both of them represent the &quot;the chosen one&quot; of each faction, it was only natural of them to meet on the battlefield. After a flashy display of unnecessary skills and spells ( since male mc, which we will address as player 1 from now on, could simply cut through her spells if he wanted to ) Alice simply happens to slip on the ice SHE created, directly into player 1&#039;s arms, but not before each of them shouts that they want to stop the war. Of course, fate intervenes and the two meet again, this time in neutral city, a city where both factions, although at war and aloof towards each other, simply decided not to fight. And the main characters just so happen to stumble over each other not just once. But again. And again. And again. And again. As they get to know each other, the two realise that the main difference between them as characters is that one of them is female and the other one is male. As they have the exact same tastes, ideals, choice of words etc. A romantic sparks is lit between them. Because we can&#039;t have your average wanna be everything anime without romance, right? The plot just goes on, circling around the exact same tropes : random meetings between the two, adding a bit of tinder to their romance, approving of each other&#039;s ideas and tastes as much as possible, with a bit of action sprinkled around. As the story moves on, every character which is not directly relevant to the development ( kek ) between the main characters becomes irrelevant. <br />
<br />
Art : 6/10.<br />
<br />
Art is fine. I mean, it&#039;s 2020 standards. It&#039;s not trash, but it&#039;s not even half of stuff like ufotable quality. <br />
<br />
Sound : 5/10. <br />
<br />
No matter how pathetic an anime, good sound effects and soundtracks can do wonders. Yuki Kajiura&#039;s pieces in SAO will forever be proof to that. But this doesn&#039;t happen here. <br />
<br />
Characters : 1/10.<br />
<br />
The characters in this show are dreadful. Boring. Generic. Cliche. <br />
<br />
Iska : player 1. For the sake of trying to make him likeable, both by the audience and the female mc, the author makes him free a young witch ( his enemy ) from prison, which in turn has him imprisoned and stripped of his rank. He&#039;s nothing more than the worst version of your average black haired protagonist. Absolutely righteous, willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good, devoid of emotion, not believeable as an actual person in the slightest, with a worthless attempt for a sad backstory in order to stay true to the shonen formula. <br />
<br />
Alice Nebulis IX: a powerful, flawless blondie gilgamesh with big breasts. That&#039;s pretty much all you need to know about her, other than her being a full copy of iska. One other detail which is actually worth noting is the IX (9) in her name. Seeing as the war was started 100 years ago by Nebulis I, 9 generation of nebulis spawnlings appeared over the course of a decade. Do witches have kids at the age of 10 in this anime?  <br />
<br />
Missmiss : the captain. Her character is there only for fan service and those poorly executed comedic relief moments, which is either falling on the ground, breast bounce or random loli screams. She is incompetent in every single aspect, including her role as a character in this anime. She can also survive the most powerful spells in the universe unscathed, since player 1 would be sad if she died. <br />
<br />
Random ashen haired guy : sacrastic, mean guy, who&#039;s only purpose is to be in contrast with player 1. Looks more like a young archer emiya shirou than emiya shirou does. <br />
<br />
Redhead girl : the generic cheerful girl that works hard and hints that she might be somewhat useful, if only she was a main character, that is. <br />
<br />
Alice&#039;s handmaiden : the one and only character in this show which is remotely believeable. She does not have enough relevance to the plot to receive any trope service. If anything, she&#039;s a voice of reason who&#039;s only purpose is to be ignored by Alice. <br />
<br />
Nebulis 1 : One of the strongest witches ever alive, which awakens only to be banhammered into oblivion and forlorn in silence by MC&#039;s OP 1 shot. She was also the one who attacked the empire 100 years ago.  <br />
<br />
Iska&#039;s mentor : also the brother of nebulis 1. He managed to survive for 100 years in order to train Iska. Which makes perfect sense for a human.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 1/10.<br />
<br />
This anime was literally a pain to watch. During the 3rd episode, i constantly felt like screaming or punching something. If you don&#039;t like generic, poorly written stories with the most variated assortment of overly used tropes, this anime has every single thing that you might hate. <br />
<br />
Overall : 1/10. <br />
<br />
Watching 4 episodes of Our Last Crusade was, for sure, one of the worst experiences of my life. This anime has absolutely nothing to offer. It is so bad that you can&#039;t even make fun of it while watching. If i could give a 0 to one anime, it would be this one for sure. So, why did I watch 4 episodes? Only to be able to leave this review. <br />

    This is a real fun Romeo and Juliet kind of tale, but more magical, let me explain.<br />
<br />
The story is as I&#039;ve described. A real different kind of tale of Romeo and Juliet, with a big more context thrown in of course. With each side&#039;s higher ups seeming like there is something fishy going on in both camps. Almost making it out as if by the end of the show, both the two MCs are going to come together to put a stop to something. Which just peeks interest.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, they&#039;re two interesting characters, they do come off as a bit generic however in some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361784">
        stretch. But are fairly decent characters overall. From their backstories, to how they act in general. Though my personal favorite is the captain of the Male MC&#039;s side. She&#039;s just a treat, and is a super sweetie who you should protect.<br />
<br />
The art of this show is top notch far as I am concerned, from how the backgrounds look, how the characters look, to the magic fights in general. You can really tell there was a lot of effort put into it, and it really shows. Good work there. While the music is pretty nice, fits the scenes that it needs to do, and its very good by all means.<br />
<br />
Should you watch it? Yes, it&#039;s a fun little show, and very magical. What&#039;s not to like about that?

    This review contains spoilers. <br />
<br />
Please watch the anime first i dont want to spoil your enjoyment.<br />
<br />
With that being said, lets move on with my view on this awesome anime.<br />
<br />
Characters 1/10<br />
<br />
A chosen loli mage, who obviously acts like a 4th grade tsundere while she falls in love with the generic MC<br />
<br />
The MC is a random guy with OP swords.<br />
<br />
Now we go into the team that follows the MC.<br />
<br />
We have another loli Captain who is just cute and thats it.<br />
<br />
A random girl who is all over the MC and thats basically all she does.<br />
<br />
A sasuke like serious guy just because.<br />
<br />
Random other chars.<br />
<br />
Now both the MC and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361778">
        female MC are the best &quot;warriors&quot; for the empire and respectivly mages.<br />
<br />
<br />
ART 5/10<br />
<br />
Your usual art, nothing too bad about it.<br />
<br />
Sound 4/10<br />
<br />
Good music doesnt make up for a trash story.<br />
<br />
Plot 1/10<br />
<br />
There are 2 factions at war with each other, the empire and some witches, we dont really know why, I guess they needed something to clinge on while the 2 MCS start liking each other.<br />
<br />
We start by watching the Kirito 2.0 getting a mission to destroy the all powerful Ice witch in order to help the empire win the war and restore his place within the disciples.<br />
<br />
I will skip the generic road to the fight scene and go straight into the fight, after the MC beats everybody up the ice calamity witch appears.<br />
<br />
She is so powerful that Kirito 2.0 has to move a bit in order to beat the crap out of her, after that she randomly falls from the ice she created and he catches her so they are in love.<br />
<br />
Moving on from this fight, they meet each other at the same MOVIE ( wow that was so unexpected i never believed such good writing exists) he gives her his handkerchief because she was crying, they talk back and forth on why they are at in the same place, she starts liking him more and..... thats it.<br />
<br />
They start stumbling upon each other again and again until at last they realise that ofc it must be destiny and not bad writing.<br />
<br />
Now that we got past the trash part, lets talk about the grand EPISODE, Episode 3.<br />
<br />
SPOILER WARNING.<br />
<br />
We start by them going to the same place knowing that each other will be there, and after she asks him to be her servant, the mage founder appears.<br />
<br />
The sky literaly cracks and the founder of all mages the most powerful mage appears, she casts one spell and she creates a crater around them.<br />
<br />
But dont be afraid, the powerful Kirito 2.0 and his loved one use the powerful spell called love, and they defeat the main VILLAIN, the end.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 1/10<br />
<br />
I didnt like anything about this, i just wanted this agony to end.<br />
<br />
<br />
My overall note is going to be 1/10<br />
<br />
<br />
This was an anime created just because silver link needed something for this fall, no one cared about the plot or anything, they just made a Sao like character and moved on with the show, hoping that some people will ignore the trash plot and just watch the boobs from the gilgamesh wannabe female char.<br />
<br />

    Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World is just like junk food. You know it is shit, because it is bad for your health, but you still eat it. <br />
<br />
It was one hundred years ago, when the great witch Nebulis turned The Empire into nothing but a sea of flames. The Empire, a militaristic nation and The Country of Witches, The Nebulis Royal Household Agency: the two countries that have been trapped in a never-ending war. Long ago, deep underground the planet, an imperial research unit discovered a type of energy never seen before and that energy was star spirits. The special

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369397">
        attribute of star spirits is that they live in humans; people who have drawn in a star spirit, have a bright birthmark appear on their body. And because of that, they can wield supernatural power, which other people refer to as magic. Of course, the empire started to fear people that hosted star spirits and began to discriminate against them. The oppressed got tired of it and one day started a revolt and so the Great War began. The witch forces, never strong enough, however, among them, there was the great witch Nebulis, host to the greatest star spirit of them all. She burned the empire in the flames of death. After that, those who were loved by the power of star spirits, decided to start their own country. But this was not the end of the war…<br />
<br />
Basically, the story is about the two factions. An empire starts to discriminate against its people only because of the fact that they gain power and thus are different from those who do not have this supernatural power. Either it is the love of humans to discriminate against those who are different, or just a simple fear that those with power might one day dethrone the government, call it however you want. The oppressed get tired of the fact that their own government looks down on them and now they do not actually see anything bad in discriminating against those who have no magic. What a coincidence! In this world, there are two people: Iska, the young swordsman who is among the Empire’s greatest warriors, and the ice witch, who is considered one of the strongest witches. The two are both tired of the never-ending war, but they cannot work together, because of the fact that they are from the opposing factions. However, only together will they be able to put an end to this war.<br />
<br />
This reminds me of Romeo and Juliet, but with many changes. The anime tries to be entertaining, even giving the characters some development, however, it is still hardly enough for this anime to be anywhere good. Unfortunately, with time, you understand that Aliceliese Lou Nebulis IX and Iska, the two protagonists, hardly have anything unique about them. And the story suffers way too many flaws, because of the fact that they skip a number of details from the source material.<br />
<br />
All in all, I do admit that this anime has a VERY interesting story. However, it is simply pathetic how neglected the story of this anime is. To fail that miserably, I do not know. Long story short, the show hardly has anything unique to offer you. Will I recommend this show to anyone? It depends. If you want to see something amazing, this is not the show for you. If you are looking for something average, this might be the anime you want to see. I, unfortunately, was hoping to see a much better story than that.

    Someone boldly proclaimed: &quot;This show is not all that bad, and there&#039;s ABSOLUTELY no way that it can get the shittiest score.&quot; SO...why not let me top that with a 1 (for the start, because why not) + 1 (for the ending, because I&#039;m seriously gimped out) = 2! That&#039;s a way better (enjoyment) score if I say so myself, HUR HUR.<br />
<br />
The classic novel tale of Shakespeare&#039;s Romeo and Juliet needs no introduction, and there has been only a couple of shows that are based on the &quot;forbidden love&quot; structure: Gonzo&#039;s take of the classic tale (released in 2007), and more recently, the loose inspiration

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369401">
        that is Boarding School Juliet just 2 years prior (and your boy&#039;s review is DAMN SPOT-ON, because he&#039;s a manga reader of a confidence man). <br />
<br />
But what about KimiSen, you ask? It&#039;s an action-packed military, sci-fi version of the classic novel, honouring the &quot;forbidden love&quot; setting justice, while doing a disservice cramming the story plot full of never-ending tropes and clichés that just makes you want to endlessly vomit blood. Need I mention that for the majority of you who like this, flame me all you want, you are missing out on similar shows that does everything better (hell, just go and watch Boarding School Juliet or Gonzo&#039;s 2007 adaptation, I can promise that you&#039;ll have a better overall experience). Throwing shade, and nailed it!<br />
<br />
All of these, under a flailing mangaka and novelist by the name of Kei Sazane, who&#039;s been experimenting with the &quot;same but different&quot; concepts since 2012, of which KimiSen is his latest LN work. That should give you an indication of how his &quot;work ethos&quot; is: a consistently bad track record. How the hell he got this far is beyond my wildest dreams, there&#039;s just no light bulb of originality at all (that continues to rake in his income, at least that is his livelihood now. And please don&#039;t go attack him).<br />
<br />
Story? An expected pass (because it is): Two nations of different empires at war, war&#039;s over (but not, because setting) but not for 2 characters: a boy and a girl who desire for peace upon the world, has to contend with background factions causing extra conflicts, and blah blah blah. Very standard &quot;Romeo X Juliet&quot; style story.<br />
<br />
Plot? A BIG FAT FAIL:<br />
- Your average quiet boy Iska: A Kirito rip-off of a mute, and a by-the-book-abiding &quot;righteous&quot; dark knight for a unique and special reason: the disastrous mistakes he&#039;s caused by releasing the opposing faction&#039;s captive &lt;something&gt;.<br />
- Your average tsundere girl Alice: A big-breasted femme fatale nicknamed the &quot;Ice Calamity &lt;something&gt;&quot;, and simultaneously a Gilgamesh &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot; called to oppose her &quot;lover&#039;s&quot; faction.<br />
The only thing they have in common: achieving peace (DUH), the &lt;something&gt; called witches (and girls at that), being prodigies with similar tastes (because they sure as hell do match for SOME reason), and most importantly: flirt with one another openly (at least for Alice)! Get a magical walkie-talkie or something to continue your lovey-dovey conversation.<br />
<br />
Characters? Conspicuously laughable at best:<br />
- Iska&#039;s Empire faction of self-righteous boy Jhin, &quot;fortune-telling fate&quot; Nene, &quot;Razzie Award for most useless character&quot; Mismis (and a CAPTAIN at that), double-edged mediocre &quot;defector&quot;-cum-strategist Risya, and the serious assassin Nameless, strong in-name only and a stark contrast to the MC.<br />
- Alice&#039;s Nebulis Sovereignity faction of her personal maid Rin (whom she ignores almost all the time), the younger 3rd (sister) wheel pink-haired Sisbell, the older &quot;like mother, like (1st) daughter&quot; Elletear with the conventional &quot;villain&quot; faction Masked Lord (you know they HAD to) and the faction&#039;s purebre(a)d girlish weapon Kissing (because names are so overrated).<br />
*mimics Mickey Mouse* OH BOY, those are wonderful qualities of Mary Sue archetypes!<br />
<br />
Art/Animation? ERM...one pass and one fail?<br />
As is with every Silver Link-produced show in 2020 alone: Winter&#039;s Bofuri, Spring&#039;s Otome Game, and Summer&#039;s Maou Gakuin, all these 3 shows pale in great comparison to the studio&#039;s &quot;generic-ness&quot; signature, and this Fall, it doesn&#039;t get much better than KimiSen. (Sidenote: Those 3 shows are FAR better than this, don&#039;t flame me for that, please and thanks!) Directors Shin Oonuma and Mirai Minato are back from Bofuri, and they at least honoured Kei Sazane&#039;s work in the visual front of &quot;breathtaking&quot; military pompous shown throughout the anime. At least that would be the case...if the story matches the action in terms of a victory-sized glorious match-cum-rivalry made in Heaven.<br />
<br />
Sound/Music? Averagely respectable at best.<br />
I wholeheartedly agree with @evLRise that no matter how lamentable anime can be, a good OST will be its saving grace (heck, that&#039;s the same case for Gibiate as well). Even with some big names like Yuusuke Kobayashi, Sora Amamiya, Azumi Waki and Kaori Ishikawa for an above-average VA cast, this show just makes their talents feel completely wasted, as if there&#039;s little to no life given to their characters. The OST is fine though, both Kaori Ishikawa&#039;s OP and Sora Amamiya&#039;s ED sound fairly good in spots, but I&#039;d probably just listen to the pairing once (in full) and dismiss it altogether, forever.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment? A dull, ludicrous &quot;expedition of fate&quot;/10<br />
The &quot;Romeo X Juliet&quot; story of pedestal deserves much better than this turd. I feel NOTHING for the double-sided world-building, the awfully written bland characters, the lackluster visuals and animation, and the forgettable sound and music. Even on a &quot;grand stage&quot; like this, it is a total &quot;incompleteness of cringe overload&quot; content, all wrapped up in a &quot;nice&quot; package.<br />
<br />
Overall, sometimes I want to make fun of &quot;so bad it&#039;s hilariously good&quot; shows (like Gibiate), but KimiSen by all accounts, lies at the other end of the &quot;so bad it&#039;s (un)hilariously bad&quot; spectrum. In conclusion (to quote @evLRise): &quot;So, why did I watch this show from start to finish? It&#039;s so because I can vamoose this review.&quot; Vámonos.

    Our last crusade or the rise of a new world is a joke. I don&#039;t know why the light novel got an adaptation since it would of been best just as a LN since it&#039;s a cliché romeo and juliet inspired plot that wasn&#039;t cut out for an adaptation from the beginning. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Like mentioned above, last crusade is a romeo and juliet type character story with the main character Iska being a disciple of the Empire, while big jugged Alice is a witch for the Sovereignty. Basically everyone from the Sovereignty have these elemental/magical powers while everyone in the Empire don&#039;t and instead have technology.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review379857">
        Not only was every encounter predictable, but the story itself was difficult to follow because of how many things were initially going on. Though our 2 MC&#039;s were a main focus, the anime never actually explains key components that would of explained situations a lot better and just goes off the rails for the majority of anime. Most of the time it&#039;s just the classic, &quot;Oh no here&#039;s another unexpected enemy that causes us to fight together!&quot; And don&#039;t even get me started on how much plot armor the characters had. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
I believe that if this anime didn&#039;t get adapted with good art/animation, no one would be praising it. The colors were vibrant, backgrounds were neat, and fights were quite colorful. Reminded me of SAO art at times.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The OP sounded like a goat being strangled and the ED was nothing special.<br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
After the story, the characters come next in order of worst things about last crusade. The MC, Iska, is a generic, emotionless, brainless tard. He is the obvious can&#039;t get a clue protagonist who get&#039;s all the chicks because of all the saving he does. Then comes Alice. To be honest, Alice&#039;s enormous melons, jugs, bean bags, whatever, you know what I&#039;m talking about; were the only 2 things that kept me awake during the episodes. However I must say that just slapping enormous volcanoes on her doesn&#039;t make her an interesting character. She is the same old Tsundere copied and pasted onto another romance. Not only that, but they had to give her the most cliché tsundere VA as well. Besides those two, every enemy they encountered seemed like a child written final boss created in third grade. Everything from their character designs to talk was so cringe that I couldn&#039;t stand watching any other character except Alice and her sister.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
The only parts of last crusade that I actually enjoyed were the butler and Alice sister conflict part. Since it actually added some flavor into the emotionless mc&#039;s encounters. So do I suggest watching our last crusade? No. Our last crusade or the rise of the new world or whatever it&#039;s called has no element of surprise, no actual romance progression, and no actual climax. The few main fights we get aren&#039;t even seen as crucial to the characters themselves so why should it be to us as the watchers?  <br />
<br />
If it wasn&#039;t for Alice&#039;s double quarter pounders, I probably would have fell asleep during each of the 12 episodes. In conclusion, don&#039;t waste your time on this unless you&#039;re looking for a mess of an anime with 2 very large redeeming qualities.

    Before I begin, I need to mention two things:<br />
<br />
1. I&#039;m still new to anime, but I do already know what I like and what I don&#039;t. I&#039;ve seen most of the well known ones, and I have a solid idea of how the whole mechanism works.<br />
<br />
2. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! SPOILEEEEEEEERS!<br />
<br />
Now on with the review. I started this anime with no expectations, only because I do that with every single thing. I like a good fantasy setting, and I never mind a proper fight between two strong characters. What I got here instead is an unfinished premise, a war between the science driven human under

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361779">
        the banner of the Empire, and  magic users, properly named mages.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s say that won&#039;t be a problem, as long as we have the characters of the show, whose story, while unveiled, will reveal certain facts about the world around them. That, of course, is not the case. What we are presented with fails to build anything, and instead destroys my faith in anyone being able to create a good story in 2020, under the leadership of Silver Link Studios. <br />
<br />
Enter the male protagonist, the discount Kirito of SAO fame (another crap anime btw), who is so powerful, so strong, so mysterious! Yet I have no desire to ever decipher his mystery, because the poor guy was cursed with some of the most bland, generic writing I&#039;ve ever encountered on screen.<br />
His weapons are two utterly overpowered swords, with which he can effortlessly negate any sort of magic. And I didn&#039;t even mention how he is a young flawless prodigy of his craft, because that is so unique and no one ever thought about that, right guise? Those combined make him an allpowerful, indestructible enemy from the very first episodes, and now I come to wonder, why do I even watch this shit? The guy has a built in invincibility code. What chances do the mages stand?<br />
<br />
Speaking of mages, enter the &#039;Ice Calamity Witch&#039;, one of the most feared enemy of the Empire. I really wonder why the hell are they so afraid of? She is your standard emotional, faux pacifist blonde with big tits, clumsy moves and useless powers. She cannot even hope to land a hit on anyone, not just your overpowered male protagonist. <br />
<br />
The two MCs have a cringe worthy encounter. Both factions are assisted by their useless peers, and the fight, just like this anime, goes nowhere really.<br />
<br />
Following some brief dialogue, they conclude they both wish for peace. Overcome by emotions, our dreaded Ice Calamity Witch SLIPS on her OWN ICE and lands straight into the arms of the male MC, prompting her to wish to land on his penis instead. <br />
<br />
And this is where your fight scene ends. There we go. Following this is the most vile slice of life crap I&#039;ve yet to see (and I love slice of life). The two main characters fall in love, and we are treated with an insane barrage of cock blocking failure regarded by the writers as romance. God help us all. The most undesired tropes are there, and they made me so frustrated, I&#039;m not even going to mention them. Imagine everything you wish to not see if your standard shoujo anime, and you have it. <br />
<br />
The frustrating romance we are constantly bombarded with reaches its disturbing climax in episode 3, when together, the two love enhanced protagonists manage to defeat THE MAIN VILLAIN. You read that right. In episodes 3, the main villain, the mother of all mages is defeated in the most retarded, anticlimactic fight to ever exist anywhere. After pointlessly firing nukes at the main pair, only for them to fail to reach their target (I guess this where the ICW got her skills from), she gets her one shot.ONE. SHOT. and dies. Is this the meaning of life?  Is this what Jesus Christ died for? <br />
<br />
And then some other shit happens, don&#039;t care to write about it anymore. If a show pulls such a bastard trick on the viewer, make sure its authors do not deserve the attention of anyone who is capable of breating and blinking at them same time. To hell with this. I will not watch more episodes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Time to conclude this long review, and congratulate myself for being able to write this in such a calm manner.<br />
<br />
1. Plot: 1/10, see above.<br />
2. Characters: 1/10. Besides the two protagonists, the other characters do absolutely nothing to advance the story. Dragged from the generic pool of crap, they seem to be unable to exist on their own.<br />
<br />
We have your edgy silver haired friend of the male MC, who barely gets any screen time. We have the Empire&#039;s squad captain, a loli with massive tits, who is supposed to be their emotional pylon, but all she does is trip on her shoe laces. She EVEN ADMITS her worthlessness as a captain, hahaha.  And we have the Ice Calamity Witch&#039;s assistant, who got in this anime by mistake, and now has to live with it. A speck of light in an oppressive ocean of shadow, poor woman.<br />
<br />
3. Art: 5/10, it was ok.<br />
4. Sound: 5/10, not bad, but unremarkable<br />
5. Enjoyment: I&#039;d rather be that guy who took 200 foreskins off of dead Philistine soldiers for King David, than ever have to watch this mountain of filth again.<br />
6. Overall: Please kill me. 1/10.<br />
<br />

    I will preface my review by letting you know that this is the first review I&#039;ve ever written on this website so i am sorry if i won&#039;t be following the proper reviewing format or if any mistakes by slip through but i am glad to be able to have my first be Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World.<br />
<br />
PLOT - 1<br />
The plot is a pretty basic concept where you take two warring factions and add the main protagonists on both sides mixed up with some mutual interest between the two. Similar to the story of Maoyuu Maou Yuusha. On one side

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361777">
        we have the Mage Hunters avid users of science whilst the other side has of course the mages avid users of ... well, magic. The 2 faction are also split by a neutral control ground where you&#039;ll also find the very fittingly and originally name &quot;Neutral City&quot;, a place where all wars is prohibited. By whom exactly is this prohibited or enforce is a question you might ask yourselves since the world is controlled by 2 factions that are at each other teeth ? Well we don&#039;t know, they just don&#039;t fight and we&#039;ll roll with it for the sake of the story.<br />
<br />
<br />
Moving to our two protagonists Iska the Swordsman and Alice the Witch who are dictated by the world around them to be sworn enemies. The two meet quite rapidly in the series and realize by a fortunate chain of events that they&#039;re maybe not as bad as they thought each other to be since after a grandiose display of power from each they come to terms by Alice slipping on her own Ice into the arms of our hero ; a superb mix of comedy and epic battle, i really enjoyed it ; that was sarcasm, i did not and hated every single frame of the closing moments of the first episode. The story thereafter continues with them getting closer and closer to one another and even become allies on the battlefield, hurrah for non-clicheic moments.<br />
<br />
SOUND - 1<br />
<br />
For the sound, i did not really find any piece to really move me or influence the anime, it&#039;s pretty much generic and adds nothing to the events developing on screen.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS - 1<br />
<br />
For the Characters I&#039;ll try to comment a bit on the people presented so far.<br />
<br />
Iska : Our main man Mary Sue protagonist himself. As far as I&#039;ve come to know from the episodes I&#039;ve watched Iska has an unbreakable moral compass and can never do any wrong, all he wants to do is bring forth peace between the 2 kingdoms and does not harbor any hatred for the nice witch girls next door, he even saves them tossing away all the training and prep invested in him but does anyone care ? Not really the powers that be release him for the sake of him being really strong anyway. Did i get to tell you about his strength ? No ? Well Iska is strong, like really strong, strong to the level where we&#039;re introduced to him randomly beating everyone without breaking a sweat due to the artifacts he&#039;s been giving, as to why he&#039;s gotten to be so strong and Almighty, the explanation is as good as the one you get for the existence of Neutral City. He also seems to be pretty much unbeatable at least from a Mage&#039;s point of view since the random swords he&#039;s gifted with are the strongest artifacts on the Science Geek&#039;s side, which of course the ruling council decides to give out to an under aged felon convicted for helping the enemy, that&#039;s some Neon Genesis Magi logic level there. The squad he&#039;s part off are in black hole of darkness cast by his shadow since all 3 other members seem just utterly useless compared to him on the battlefield. All in all he&#039;s a generic bland uninspired protagonist with no real trait to differentiate him form your borderline main hero.<br />
<br />
Alice : Our other protagonist and the Witch side&#039;s version and counterpart of Iska who just as him wishes for world peace and is pretty much a copy paste of 90% of what Iska thinks and does just copy pasted into a tall huge boobed blonde. The emphasis on their bond and similarities is superbly written by showing how quirky and unique they are during some very random and unexpected meetings where they enjoy the same hipster food, cold pasta, Art and even chug a Beer, how fun and unique is she fellas?<br />
<br />
Nene Alkastone : The bubbly redhead, doesn&#039;t really do much since Iska pretty much can 1 v World ; the cheery colleague added to fill some screen time with bouncing boobs.<br />
<br />
Miamis Klass : The squad captain. Clumsy, air headed, no physical skills, no combat skills, no real knowledge as most of the things are explained to her by her team as she&#039;s pretty much there as the lackluster newbie who had all the Pokemon&#039;s moves explained by Brock. Knowing all that the question I&#039;d humbly ask is .... how the hell does someone like this even come close to being part of a combat squad let alone a captain ... like all other female characters she also rocks an impressive buss om slapped onto the body of a Loli.<br />
<br />
Jhin : The wing man and bud of Iska, he&#039;s around their two i guess rocking the I&#039;m really cool calm and calculated attitude, pretty much the random dude in your class that randomly idolized Sasuke a bit too much, probably runs bent at 90 degrees with his arms spread like the wings of a plane.<br />
<br />
Rin Vispose : The only character I&#039;ve felt some empathy or emotion for. Rin is the servant/maid of Alice who seems to be the only normal nonscoring person in the series. She&#039;s kinda there i guess, even summons some golems only for the to get obliterated and one-shot to show case Iska&#039;s powers a bit. Fairly similar to Ai Hayasak from Kaguya-Sama love is War,who funnily enough is voiced by the same actress, I&#039;d like to mention this is also the only fun thing I&#039;ve found in the anime.<br />
<br />
For Character Development i really do not know what to say as pretty much the only thing that kept developing over the time I&#039;ve watched this was my sense of bore, dread and repulsion. Every generic trope is used in order to further the relationship between Iska and Alice, from her falling to his arms, to them randomly meeting up randomly multiple times in Neutral City, to liking the same stuff, having the same morally just goals and even speaking in sync. As far as we know we don&#039;t really get any explanation from either of them as two why golden prodigal chosen children / teens would want to deviate from the means of their society and ally with the enemy they&#039;ve known to have killed thousands of their comrades just because they kinda clicked, this goes back to the point of both of them being two Mary Sue characters who can never really do any wrong and won&#039;t stray from the path of righteousness and moral equity which does not really appeal to my taste since i find it to completely minimize the impact of their Alliance. The lack of struggle, conflict or justification for their random truce just makes it come of as the randomly inserted trope that it is, remake #46373 of Romeo &amp;amp; Juliette but without any of the build up.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT - 1<br />
<br />
As far as my overall enjoyment for this anime, i&#039;ve thought you can pretty much guess it was aiming towards the abyssal depths of a bottomless pit, every second of it felt and eternity only to wait and watch trope after trope intertwined in one of the most cringey and awkward ways possible. Borrowing elements from other anime&#039;s such as Fate for Alice&#039;s design and power usage, Kirito v0.03 for iska, Science Dude&#039;s council being SEELE from Neon Genesis etc. etc. will not magically make an anime be good. In my opinion this is the worst anime I&#039;ve ever seen due to the sheer amount of elements that i for one find distasteful, meaningless or downright nonsensical that it employs and i have rated it accordingly and will not waste anymore time with watching further episodes.<br />
<br />
ART - 6<br />
<br />
For starters let&#039;s begin with what I&#039;ve found likable about the anime. The graphics/animation were fairly good although i am the first to admit i am not exactly enamoured by the graphics part of an anime and find the Story, Characters and Sound to be of a far greater importance, but that is just me.<br />
<br />
Moving on to what I&#039;ve disliked about the anime and it&#039;s a pretty long list and i am not exactly sure what i should start off with so let&#039;s begin with the story.<br />
<br />

    Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou, Aruiwa Sekai ga Hajimaru Seisen (2020)<br />
<br />
Honestly, please ignore the title it is literally just another Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle in a different world. Regardless of whatever grand scheme they claim it is just a Romeo and Juliet story of a Tsundere and a clueless guy trying to get off. <br />
<br />
The story tries to push forward with the let&#039;s have peace or die trying but it just doesn&#039;t do it and leaves with a few holes in the story like what the hell is happening with Mismis.<br />
<br />
The art style is pretty good throughout. Use of CGI is a bit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369432">
        crude in places but works well enough. Has some clarity issues in places but overall not a great issue. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack is not bad and magic is a bit empty with some SFX but it doesn&#039;t really have any boom to it. <br />
<br />
As far as character development the main pair are somewhat dull since it is so Romeo and Juliet. Other characters are pretty good supporting characters who are just sort of there. <br />
<br />
Best girls:<br />
<br />
Nebulis by far. Our main enemy announced at the start but also irrelevant it seems. <br />
Sisbell<br />
Kissing<br />
Rin <br />
<br />
You do get a nice beach scene with a swimsuit that has a cat tail that was pretty damn cute. <br />
<br />
The show is enjoyable in terms of fan service but the story doesn&#039;t do anything particularly and leaves you with a sour taste due to nothing really happening. Not a dig at just this show but why do characters need to cross each other pass when they run off into a fight together.<br />
<br />
Overall it doesn&#039;t need to return and ended somewhat as a read me if you fancy it. That is down to you but not for my list in this instance. <br />
<br />
5/10.

    Silverlink have had a very impressive year. Producing in my opinion, 4 of the best shows of the year. <br />
<br />
Kimisen, by far the most underrated of the 4, is a rather unique twist on the traditional Romeo and Juliet forbidden love type story. It’s got many of the same motifs you’d associate with that sort of story, but presents them in an original way with a really interesting world and characters. As someone who loves that type of romance, this was a great experience.<br />
<br />
On one hand, some may argue kimisen is “generic”, as if that inherently makes something bad. I personally don’t find that to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369399">
        be the case and really thought Iska and Alice’s relationship and the conflict between their countries was enjoyable. Silverlink have a reputation for taking rather “generic” stories and turning them into enjoyable watches with good direction, voice acting and choreography. This was no exception.<br />
<br />
I feel at times the pacing was slightly off and there were some leaps in logic, but that’s to be expected from LN adaptations, so I won’t be too harsh on Silverlink for that. This definitely feels like an example of the studio promoting the source material and it did just the job for me. I’m a sucker for good romance, comedy and drama, and I think Kimisen has that in abundance. I’ll definitely be checking out the Light Novels to get the rest of the story.<br />
<br />
Kimisen gets 9 astral crests out of 10.

    No spoilers ahead, feel free to read.<br />
<br />
The whole anime is like an epitome of the score &quot;7&quot;. The one thing that saves the anime from a worse score is the art and the story itself. The story will definitely seem familiar as it is basically Romeo &amp; Juliet with Magic and a Fantasy World slapped onto it.<br />
<br />
The fanservice in the anime is astounding. Lolis with nonexistent brains, characters with huge boobs, but still, there is a backstory that makes you wonder. At the very least, so far.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don&#039;t recommend if you are going to watch it on a per week basis, wait for all

    The show is perfect! And do you know why? Because it is inspired by Romeo and Juliet, a beautiful classic!<br />
<br />
The art and 8/10 a high note for a good animation.<br />
<br />
Characters 9/10 on account of the principals and princesses.<br />
<br />
10/10 story because of the plot. The romance is serious and very well built but unpredictable and does not give a real idea of ​​who will be with Iska.<br />
<br />
<br />
Perfect anime. You need a continuation urgently ...<br />
<br />
<br />
People who criticize anime are people with no census because they have already been trained and have a closed critical idea like an oyster. I&#039;m sorry but for those who appreciate the book

    I&#039;ve watched all 12 episodes, and so far this show is good. <br />
<br />
Art? I&#039;ll give it 8/10 for this show which I can still enjoy it. <br />
<br />
Story? The story is good, not extraordinary, but the story is really still worth watching. <br />
<br />
Character? I love Alice and Iska, they really are a perfect match in this story, not bad at all. <br />
<br />
I enjoy this program because the storyline is not easy to predict, as I can&#039;t yet imagine how the two of them can realize their dream of uniting that world when things are like that.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know why there are so many people who give

    Y’all this anime is a 5 at worst PLEASE omg<br />
The anime may be generic, but it’s actually quite enjoyable to me. Generic doesn’t always mean bad, it just means average, this is definitely not a “1.”<br />
<br />
The story may be quite average, but the plot is easy to follow and progresses nicely. The art style isn’t anything fantastic, but the animation is well done and the designs are cute.<br />
<br />
The op and Ed aren’t anything special, but the voice acting and bgm fit nicely together, and I don’t find myself cringing at any of the dialogue (aside from the captain every now and then lmao)<br />
<br />
The characters definitely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365360">
        all have their generic personalities, but I don’t find them to be overly cliched, as they’re not exaggerated and dramatic like most anime characters. They interact well, and the anime isn’t filled with constant drama and misunderstandings. The characters are grounded and fairly mature, the male MC isn’t too overpowered nor is he an idiot, and the female MC isn’t an obnoxious tsundere either.<br />
<br />
Please give this anime a chance if you’re looking for a quick and fun watch! I wouldn’t recommend it to somebody who’s looking for something deep or extremely investing, but if you just want to find a show to sit back and relax to, this is a solid choice.

    I&#039;m not a fan of long reviews so I&#039;m going to keep this short and to the point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another light novel adaptation, which gives off a Romeo and Juliet vibe. <br />
<br />
The story reminds me a little of Romeo and Juliet if it was badly written and had magic in it. The story it self has some interesting ideas but as a whole its fairly badly put together and is mostly uninteresting. <br />
<br />
The art is mostly standard, there isn&#039;t much to say about it, nothing impressionable. The animations are mostly fine, few bits of CG here and there but other than that nothing bad, nothing good. <br />
<br />
Characters?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362752">
        as generic as you can get if you ask me. Personally the maid is the only cool character which actually has a brain. The main character is another Kirito, even has dual swords. They mostly have pretty generic features and are very basic. <br />
<br />
<br />
The show isn&#039;t bad, but honestly, it isn&#039;t that good either. If you are into light novel adaptations or you really have nothing else to watch, go for it, but I wouldn&#039;t recommend watching it if you&#039;re looking for something good. <br />
<br />

    Since this reminds me of SAO...<br />
<br />
All girls within a 100m radius of the male protagonist fall for him.<br />
The female lead reminds me of Asuna.<br />
The male lead uses overpowered dual-wielding just like Kirito.<br />
And a lot more SAO crap.<br />
<br />
The story of our last crusade takes place in a fantasy universe where two factions, namely, the empire ( consisting of humans ) and the witches are at war. Why? Because the show needed an intrigue. The shows beings roughly 100 years after the outbreak of war, and the action revolves around 2 characters, Iska, the strongest solider in the human empire - except he&#039;s not. He just has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362050">
        2 beyond over powered swords. One which can apparently nullify any magic. Imagine being a witch and fighting against that with magic. The second main character is Alice, a direct descendant of Nebulis, the most powerful witch in the world. As both of them represent the &quot;the chosen one&quot; of each faction, it was only natural of them to meet on the battlefield. After a flashy display of unnecessary skills and spells ( since male mc, which we will address as player 1 from now on, could simply cut through her spells if he wanted to ) Alice simply happens to slip on the ice SHE created, directly into player 1&#039;s arms, but not before each of them shouts that they want to stop the war. Of course, fate intervenes and the two meet again, this time in neutral city, a city where both factions, although at war and aloof towards each other, simply decided not to fight. And the main characters just so happen to stumble over each other not just once. But again. And again. And again. And again. As they get to know each other, the two realise that the main difference between them as characters is that one of them is female and the other one is male. As they have the exact same tastes, ideals, choice of words etc. A romantic sparks is lit between them. Because we can&#039;t have your average wanna be everything anime without romance, right? The plot just goes on, circling around the exact same tropes : random meetings between the two, adding a bit of tinder to their romance, approving of each other&#039;s ideas and tastes as much as possible, with a bit of action sprinkled around. As the story moves on, every character which is not directly relevant to the development ( kek ) between the main characters becomes irrelevant.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are an SAO fan then you will probably like this anime.<br />

DISCLAIMER: If you love romance animes, power fantasies, or just like generic MC&#039;S, you probably still wouldn&#039;t like this show(That was a joke).<br />
<br />
Ok so before I start I just want to let you know this is my first MAL review, so I apologize if its poor quality. I am not reviewing the sound. This review contains minor spoilers.<br />
<br />
This is my final edit until I create a new review when the anime finishes:<br />
<br />
A new season, a new long titled LN anime to enjoy! This seasons entry is &quot;Our last crusade or the rise of a new world&quot;. If you dont know yet this is a Romeo

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363924">
        and Juliet styled anime. I actually thought I was going to enjoy this anime since romance animes usually get me hooked quick even if the storyline is below average, and as you can tell by my rating, it did not. Ok so with that out of the way, on to the review!<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
<br />
<br />
This story is basically your typical Romeo and Juliet story done wrong... like really wrong. Im not gonna pretend like I&#039;ve seen a ton of romance anime or anime in general. For starters the main character (Iska) starts off arrested for breaking a &quot;witch&quot; out of the empires jail (if your wondering what the hell is going on, its because this is out of context, just watch the damn show). obviously he gets arrested for it, when he gets sent out to capture this witch called alice(the love interest) he lets her go for some reason. I&#039;ll go more into depth with this in the character page. They basically keep meeting up for some reason(which is incredibly corny) and eventually start liking eachother just because they see eachothers faces a lot. No joke, two enemies like eachother just because they see eachother a lot. When you make love at first sight exist in a story (which might of happened here) you need to write the dialogue well, and we all know most LN writers aren&#039;t capable of that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
 <br />
The art looks pretty decent. The art is the one thing thats above a 5 with this show.<br />
<br />
Characters: 1/10<br />
<br />
Ok so did you think the story was bad? Im just gonna say if it was possible to rate characters a 0 I would&#039;ve. Lets go over all of them!<br />
<br />
1/10 Iska: Basicially one of the worst LN anime MC&#039;S out there. Overpowered? Check. Way too good of a person? Check. Honestly, hes even worse than Kirito from Sword art online. <br />
<br />
3/10 Alice: A tsundare blonde haired girl sounds like a 10/10 waifu design doesn&#039;t she? Well design doesn&#039;t mean anything when they aren&#039;t written well. Alice basically likes her own enemy because... well thats just it no one knows why. Oh did I mention she even HELPS Iska sometimes? Other than those bad ones no other personality traits.<br />
<br />
Then we have my biggest problem. The most useless character in the show is the captain(Mismis Klassz). Why the hell is this even a thing?<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2/10<br />
<br />
Although I literally Have to force myself to watch this every week, the coincidences of Iska and Alice meeting practically everywhere is hilarious. I also can&#039;t rate it a 1 because im still watching it.<br />
<br />
Overall: 1/10<br />
<br />
 As you can see, I changed my rating from a 2/10 to a 1/10. If your wondering why its because after episode 9. To be specific the Demon Sallinger vs Iska fight. Sallinger is basically just a poor mans Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh being one of my favorite characters in anime made me like it pretty fast, and nearly got me to change my character rating... Until Iska somehow beat him. Im kinda confused on how the hell a MC can be this bad that they can beat a fricking demon in the 9th episode. It seems they took every power fantasy MC trope, combined them, and created a dumpster fire of a anime.                            <br />

    Mediocre: The Anime. <br />
<br />
I have to say, despite not having that much expectation prior to starting this anime, it somehow managed to leave even more disappointment, and yes, it&#039;s partially my fault.<br />
<br />
Studio Silver Link is a well-founded company with numerous mediocre anime albeit some good ones, and yet they somehow have surpassed people&#039;s expectations this year with its rather succeessful lineup including the likes of Bofuri, Hamefura and The Misfit of Demon King Academy. <br />
<br />
While dropping Bofuri at episode 6 (yes I know this is loved by most people but I just found it extremely boring, and I do not use the world extreme that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369800">
        often), I cannot deny that I enjoyed the other two to some extent so naturally I went in thinking this could be interesting. The ever present director of Silver Link, Oonuma Shin, was indeed involved in three ouf the four I mentioned, as well as some of my favourites like Baka to Test and e.f. series, so that does kind of support my expectation in a way.<br />
<br />
Story 5/10<br />
It&#039;s nothing special, although I would give some credit for not being an isekai alone. The story feels as if Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet was in a fantasy setting, with a (lot) more generic male lead. It&#039;s a standard LN adaptation for the purpose of advertising and boosting LN sales, so the story was guaranteed to be either rushed or incomplete and indeed, it&#039;s inconclusive with no hints of a season 2 (yet). The setting was nice (fantasy vs modern warfare) but that was it.<br />
<br />
Art 4/10<br />
The factor I care about the most usually, and it was sub-par most of the times. The previous three this year had better character designs. But does this have better action or animation quality in general? Not quite. Silver Link does not even have a reuputation of having good action scenes but I found it even more underwhelming than Maou Gakuin, which was not great either.<br />
<br />
Character 6/10<br />
The 907th unit was uninteresting most of the time; arguably Nene could have not been there for the entirety of anime and it would not have affected the storyline so much. Male MC is just another Kirito-kun (even the design) and while the female lead is a lot more attractive, I still prefer the character with the same VA from last season (yes Cheezuru is best girl of 2020, fite me). Her younger sister Sisbell is actually the best girl from this anime despite not having so much screen time, and she single-handedly increased the score by one in this criteria. good girl. Maid girl(Rin) seemed interesting at first due to her resemblance of Hayasaka but she quickly fell off after constantly attacking our MC-kun unfoundedly. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 4/10<br />
I had to half-force myself to watch this every week, and that&#039;s a minus. While some parts of the stroy kept me slightly interested, most arcs simply ended up with MC-kun&#039;s OP-ness (it&#039;s worrying that I can&#039;t even remember his name while typing this). I would say it was only marginally better than the likes of Asterisk Wars and Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut.   <br />
<br />
Overall 5/10<br />
It was close to being a 4 but I thought that would be too harsh in my standards given I did enjoy some bits. It&#039;s really not different from the common LN adaptations we see nowadays apart from the fact that it is not an isekai, and the MC is not even remotely OP as Maou Gakuin&#039;s Anos (wow, I still remember his name) so it wasn&#039;t as enjoyable. <br />
<br />
If you love those incompleted LN adaptations with some OP-ness and fancy Amamiya Sora, you should check this out. Otherwise, don&#039;t.
