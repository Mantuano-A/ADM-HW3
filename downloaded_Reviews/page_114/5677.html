God, I’m tired. <br />
<br />
I’m tired of all the carbon-copied isekai light novel adaptations like Kenja no Mago, but Japan keeps pumping them out because it’s what makes money.<br />
<br />
I’m tired of the same ubiquitous ‘isekai truck’ killing some random asshole before he even gets a single character trait, all for the sake of reincarnating him in an otaku power-fantasy wet dream. <br />
<br />
I’m tired of narcissistic overpowered protagonists, lacking any personality, only existing to be praised and loved by every cardboard cutout character in the show.<br />
<br />
I’m tired of 12-year old level writing quality; the story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311406">
        jumps from a violent nation-wide demon attack, then magic-school comedy, then two fanservice episodes back to back!<br />
<br />
I’m tired of the boring magic-school settings with absolutely no plot other than finding ways to show off how much more powerful the protagonist is than everyone else.<br />
<br />
I’m tired of potentially interesting plot development getting swept under the rug in favor of pointless unfunny comedy, meanwhile, everything relevant to the story happens off-screen.<br />
<br />
I’m tired of generic pandering character art, indistinguishable from any other isekai adaptation.<br />
<br />
I’m tired of dozens of forgettable side characters sticking to the protagonist like flies on shit.<br />
<br />
I’m tired of one-dimensional waifus, with no difference other than candy-colored hair and the incredibly important breast sizes; there is even a cup size ranking in the opening credits.<br />
<br />
I’m tired of terrible squeaky-sounding waifu voice acting; like the raspy blue-haired bitch, her breathless and desperate voice made the other generic waifus sound decent.<br />
<br />
I’m tired of sexual assault used as a threat to the waifu bait but simultaneously used as an excuse for gross NTR fanservice; which is how the two main female characters get introduced.<br />
<br />
I’m tired of all the potato-tier artwork, cheap flashy effects, and copy-pasted magic circles tossed in, rather than actual animation.<br />
<br />
I’m tired of hideous off-model character animation from the very first episode until the last: eyes distorted like they are melting right off of people’s faces, body proportions constantly look off, and shading is non-existent. <br />
<br />
I’m tired of carelessly tacked-on romance with no progression other than the writers forcing the characters together—like oil and water—until you accept it; neither of them put effort into their relationship, circumstances just push them together.<br />
<br />
I’m tired of the same three stock background songs playing on loop for entire episodes; couldn’t they have gone one dollar over budget and added a few more?<br />
<br />
I’m tired of overly audio-tuned J-Pop opening and ending songs all these shows use, they are indistinguishable from each other. <br />
<br />
I’m tired of crappy ‘special’ ending credits worse than the original, like the CGI eye-trauma in episode 6; it’s like they watched the Chika dance from Kaguya-sama then tried (and failed) to copy it.<br />
<br />
I’m tired of (anti)climactic scenes that try to make you empathize with a cast of cardboard cutouts who have no personalities; the only introspective character moment happened when the protagonist was MILDLY bothered by killing a person.<br />
<br />
I’m tired of watching the same episode every week, always gaining nothing but boredom and frustration, then feeling like twenty-three minutes on the toilet would have been more eventful.<br />
<br />
I’m tired. I’m tired. I’m tired… Kenja no Mago makes me so very tired. Watching the same anime with the same faults season after fucking season is driving me insane. One day it will end.<br />
<br />
One day.

    Dude gets rekted by an oncoming vehicle and dies in the first episode.  But at least he wasn’t wearing a green, Hillary Clinton jumpsuit with his hair slicked back like Fonzie.<br />
<br />
OOOOHHhhhhh, it’s Mr. Spirit Gun your girl!<br />
<br />
In an age where originality is sparse to non-existent and numerous studios rely on shocking revelations to draw in viewers.  It’s refreshing to watch an anime that pushes the boundaries on what is possible.  By innovating the method in which they present the story, creating interesting character dynamics, and presenting thematic elements relevant to the current culture.  Philosopher’s Grandson, on the other hand, does nothing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307548">
        of the sort.  It is the epitome of trite, unambitious entertainment.  In fact, the abundance of Isekai in recent years has watered down the standards, making past travesties look tolerable in comparison to the new train wrecks.<br />
<br />
Overpowered characters are a hindrance toward a story’s overall success.  Especially when the character is altruistic, ‘nice,’ and lacking in common sense.  Whether it’s Goku, Rimuru Tempest, Kirito, et al., there are certain tendencies (tropes, if you will) that become duplicated so often, that the characters are carbon copies placed in a different world with unique powers to conceal their banality.  <br />
<br />
Shin Wolfwood, the main character for “Kenja no Mago,” is the personification of an overpowered, stereotypical do-gooder.  Nothing he says or does resonates with the viewer, given the artificial nature of his character.  As a consequence, the various side characters — whom rely on Shin as a leader and moral compass — are relegated to Shin’s ‘cheering’ section.  This dynamic precludes the various side characters from receiving their own development; thereby, rendering them absent of a genuine personality.<br />
<br />
In summation, “Kenja no Mago” is an amalgamation of ‘simple’ themes, recycled character tropes, subpar animation, and zero innovative flare.  Strip away its magical facade and it has no identity.  Add in the predictable character motivations, and “Kenja no Mago” is a dry work devoid of creativity.

    Wise Man’s Grandchild, the story of another sad man from Japan getting killed and put into another world. And if it wasn’t for the purpose of this show I would criticize this. Which leads me to a point that I believe everyone that ridicules this show and other isekai never understand. COMPARE IT TO THE RIGHT SHOWS. To many people that I see criticize this show are comparing it to the wrong isekai. In my opinion if you are comparing Wise Man to shows like Re Zero or Overlord you are sadly mistaken. I will admit that yes the side characters are simple, the plot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311478">
        is nothing special, and the MC is WAY overpowered. But most of that is the point. Shows I compare Wise Man to are Konosuba and In Another World With My Smartphone, aka parody/comedies. Wise Man is one of the funniest shows I have ever watched, and running against Isekai Quartet gave it hard compilation. I’ll go through more of what I mean in the individual sections, but I just wanted to state my case and let it be known. <br />
<br />
Animation (6-7/10): The animation is nothing special, its appealing enough that you don’t want to look away. It also has its many moments of fanservice, which I don&#039;t mind at all haha. And honestly I thought that the fights and magic were fairly well done. I wouldn’t recommend this show because of its animation, but I really don’t see any problems with it. <br />
<br />
Music/Voice Acting (8/10): Being completely honest most of this comes from the voice acting. Music wise I never really cared for anything besides the op, which while nothing special was catchy and cute. Also I watched 11 of the 12 episodes in english and I LOVED it, and while some people think Sicilien’s raspy voice was annoying, I thought it was the cutest thing ever. I give major props to Funimation for having a fairly unknown cast give an excellent performance. Sub wise from what I watched they were also good, but I didn’t see enough to really rate.<br />
<br />
Characters (6/10): I’m going to be honest, the characters are only memorable for two things comedy and their bodies. I don’t mean that in a bad way but I am a young man so that is something I look at. I rather liked Shin as he used the science of our world to be that powerful in the other world, a fact many people don&#039;t seem to acknowledge. Prince August was generic but better than most male friends in Isekai. Most of the girls were generic based on the usual types, clumsy, aggressive, flat, busty, all that jazz. But the writers used that to their advantage and gave us funny sequences. Villain wise I thought they were at least inspired and not some “I&#039;m going to take over the world because why not”. But again the characters are nothing special unless you are attracted to 2d girls, but most of us are probably<br />
<br />
Plot (5/10): Again it&#039;s nothing special, a group of young kids taught by the most powerful prodigy ever fighting demons/demonoids. As said before, I like that the villains reasons are more inspired than most other isekai antagonists. But its simple and honestly I think it’s just enough to keep people interested, because if this show was always comedy it would become forgetfull like other isekai, as really only Konosuba has pulled off stupid comedy 24/7 <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10): So far this is my favorite show of the season and I doubt anything will top it. I haven’t laughed this much over an anime in forever. I binged the first 11 episodes in no time and waited in agony for the last episode. I loved the cute romance, although I do love harems haha, the simple plot that kept things serious, the constant humor that really hit me hard and just an enjoyable overall feel. <br />
<br />
Overall (9/10): If this show didn’t have its serious plot or tried to be a serious show like a Re Zero then I would probably believe with the naysayers of this show. But not enough people look at the small details and things this show does that make it so enjoyable. If you have any questions or want to try to see things my way I urge you to message me, like a human and not some but hurt critic, and rewatch the show as a parody then as something that&#039;s serious. <br />

    (Esta reseña tiene una versión en español más abajo)<br />
This is one of the most uninspired jobs I&#039;ve seen in my life.<br />
Any cliche of a light novel that you can think, occurs here.<br />
<br />
There are hundreds of Isekais with an Op MC, how is this anime different from those others? For absolutely nothing, it is the same stupid fantasy of empowerment with an escapist message. At least Overlord and Shield Hero try to be their own thing, but this anime does not even try.<br />
Creativity is more important than originality. But this anime does not have any.<br />
<br />
The protagonist is your typical Gary sty self-insert without personality. He don&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307552">
        have a defined characterization so it can act in the way that the script says without contradicting anything, because there is nothing to contradict.<br />
<br />
He lacks an opinion of his own and is reactive to everything. The story revolves around him but he does not move it, the other characters are the ones who do it.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t care about the history failure of this thing, the mere fact that the prota is OP (and that this isn&#039;t comedy), already makes the story and the protagonist softer and not interesting at all.<br />
The first caps are spent masturbating to the protagonist self-insert, or rather, to the viewer that is OP, isn&#039;t arrogant and did not ask anything of that so you do not feel bad about you are OP. He&#039;s better than everyone of the same age, is better than everyone else, get the beautiful girls, is raised by the greatest heroes, etc. How can you have tension with such a character?<br />
<br />
By the way, is not it curious how he says to keep all his memories of his past life but acts like an ignorant who does not even know how to buy?. Plot holes~ (Remember everything except how he died although that is not really important)<br />
It is even more stupid as it is he did not know that kings and heroes lived with him. Perhaps he never asked them: Who were they? o What do they do in their day to day?<br />
<br />
And that shitty comedy with exaggerated faces and screaming people is not funny, well, maybe for someone 13 years old. It&#039;s like going back 10 years ago where comedy was very bad.<br />
The rest of the characters are just one-dimensional archetypes just as empty as the protagonist.<br />
The animation and the soundtrack is mediocre.<br />
<br />
A recommendation? Literally, almost any other anime is more entertaining and creative than this one.<br />
<br />
That is all.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Este es uno de los trabajos más desinspirados que he visto en mi vida.<br />
Todo cliché de novela ligera que se te pueda ocurrir ocurre aquí.<br />
<br />
Hay cientos de Isekais con un protagonista Overpower, ¿De qué se diferencia este anime de esos otros? Por absolutamente nada, es la misma estúpida fantasía de empoderamiento con un mensaje escapista. Al menos Overlord y Shield Hero intentan ser su propia cosa, pero este anime ni siquiera lo intenta.<br />
La creatividad es más importante que la originalidad. Pero este anime ni tiene ninguna.<br />
<br />
El protagonista es tu típico Gary sty autoinsertable sin personalidad. No tiene una caracterización definida por lo que puede actuar de la forma que el guión diga sin contradecir nada, porque no hay nada que contradecir.<br />
Carece de una opinión propia y es reactivo a todo. La historia gira alrededor de él, pero él no la mueve, los otros personajes son los que lo hacen.<br />
<br />
No me importa la historia de esta cosa, el mero hecho de que el prota sea OP y esto no sea comedia ya lo hace menos interesante. Los primeros caps se la pasan masturbando al protagonista autoinsertable, o mejor dicho, al espectador de que es OP, no es arrogante y no pidió nada de eso para que no te sientas mal de que eres Op.<br />
Es mejor que todos los de su misma edad, consigue a las chicas lindas, es criado por los más grandes héroes, puede hacer cualquier cosa, etc. ¿Cómo puede tener tensión con un personaje así?<br />
<br />
Por cierto, ¿No es curiosos como dice conservar todos sus recuerdos de su vida pasada pero actúa como un ignorante que ni siquiera sabe comprar?. Plot holes~ (Recuerda todo menos como murió aunque eso no es importante realmente)<br />
Es incluso más estúpido como es él no sabía que reyes y héroes vivían con él, acaso nunca les pregunto ¿Quienes eran? o ¿Qué es lo que hacen en su día a día?<br />
<br />
Y esa comedia pedorra con caras exageradas y gente gritando no es graciosa, bueno tal vez para alguien de 13 años. Es como volver hace 10 años atrás donde la comedia era muy mala.<br />
El resto de personajes son solo arquetipos unidimensionales igual de vacíos que el protagonista.<br />
La animación y la banda sonora es mediocre.<br />
<br />
¿Una recomendación? Literalmente, casi cualquier otro anime es más entretenido y creativo que este.<br />
<br />
Eso es todo.

    After being killed for no reason whatsoever, an average salary-man is reincarnated into a fantasy world. Upon his reincarnation, he meets one of the most powerful beings in the universe. Entering a familial relationship with this being, the protagonist becomes extremely overpowered. Following this, every character who knows about the MC&#039;s awesomeness jerks off to his amazing powers. All the while, we have an insanely bland cast of side characters and really generic art, with barely any overarching plot.<br />
<br />
Some dude from an insanely influential family enrolls in a magic high school. Turns out, this dude is the most overpowered creature in the universe. Not only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311401">
        is he so overpowered that he can create whole new types of magic and magic gear (oh yeah, he&#039;s also literally invincible), but he is also absurdly good at hand-to-hand combat. Every side character, unable to even hope of competing with the MC&#039;s awesomeness, just kinda sits there in awe of his overpoweredness. The whole show is pretty much about how cool and OP the MC is.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m talking about TenSura and Mahouka, right? Well, fuck you, I&#039;m actually talking about Silver Link&#039;s newest indistinguishable stream of visual diarrhea, pumped out for the sole purpose of turning a profit by pandering to insecure losers who seek escapism in the form of anime with insanely overpowered blank slate self-inserts MCs.<br />
<br />
Special shoutout to my favorite joke of the show: some irrelevant side character tells the MC to hold back on his magic powers. The MC completely annihilates the room they are in, and then says &quot;haha sorry I was holding back&quot;. Holy shit. Now this is truly the pinnacle of comedy, refined and perfected after centuries of studying such pioneering comedians as Aristophanes and Dante. How could the anime industry possibly hope to compete against such creative genius? Garbage like Yojouhan and Kaguya-sama simply can&#039;t compete with the intellectual titan known as Tsuyoshi Yoshioka.<br />
<br />
Oh, and, I couldn&#039;t possibly end this review without crediting the greatest peak of creativity brought to us by the anime industry this Spring: that one episode where they told us about the main antagonist&#039;s backstory. Now, this was truly tragic. Indeed, as I sat in front of my monitor on that Wednesday, eager to watch the latest episode of Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni, I was not expecting to be hit with such tear-inducing drama. As I sat there and learned that the main bad guy used to be good, but then some bad things happened to him, causing him to turn bad, I wept.<br />

    &quot;Oh boy! I can&#039;t wait for the next anime isekai!&quot; -Trash taste Weeb.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve seen pretty much every isekai that anime has to offer, and meanwhile some of them were not that great, I believe that I&#039;m in the minority that truly enjoys most isekais.<br />
<br />
Kenja no Mago follows the typical isekai storyline of being reborn in another world as an OP MC. While I personally enjoy these types of anime, I understand why the majority of weebs out there are sick of this non-unique and generic concept with only slight differences in the story. I&#039;ll say upfront that if you are one of the people that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307555">
        despises isekais, then this is without a doubt not the anime for you.<br />
<br />
The art for this anime is pretty generic and there isn&#039;t really anything in particular that stands out, as far as the art style goes. I don&#039;t really mind it, but I know that other people out there will believe the contrary.<br />
The soundtrack isn&#039;t anything special either and the characters are as generic as an isekai anime could get. <br />
<br />
Even with all these flaws, I for some reason really enjoy watching Kenja no Mago, and while I must admit that I have a &quot;shit-taste&quot; in anime, I believe that Kenja no Mago is a good anime.<br />
Overall, I&#039;m giving this anime a solid 7/10. &lt;3

    In the words of Charles Barkley:<br />
&quot;THAT&#039;S TURRIBLE.&quot;<br />
<br />
Okay, seriously, people…why does it have to be so GOD DAMN hard to write an actual good fantasy story nowadays? Where’s the sense of originality? Where’s the sense of creativity? Apparently as of right now, anime is under a mini-crisis, and it involves the all-too-familiar infamous genre of “isekai”. It’s not the genre itself that is bad, it’s just the endless supply of all these cheap knockoff shows, written and produced purely for the sake of easy cash grabs and light novel promotions. Now, in all honesty, I will not condone the lack of originality in a series as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311412">
        long as it can be entertaining and creative with its premises. But oh my lord, this series, Kenja No Mago (or Wise Man’s Grandchild, Philosopher’s Grandson, or Magi’s Grandson) had absolutely NONE of the two.<br />
<br />
To start off, I’m pretty sure we all know the drill regarding what constitutes as isekai (translated as “different world”). It’s actually a subgenre of general Japanese fantasy, and it usually revolves around a main character(s), usually normal humans from Earth, being transported to, reincarnated, or trapped in a parallel universe or an entirely different world, often a fictional one with notably more supernatural or magic-based premises. As much as the isekai is often criticized as a subgenre and concept, it still welcomes a good amount of creativity as there has been a good number of unique and alternative takes on it. The problem is that the general premises of isekai are just way too easy to establish, and it’s because of this that many writers will forego the chance at creativity for the sake of “quantity over quality”, whether it’s writing up a story with typical tropes and unengaging themes and plot elements, or just blatantly rip off a previously produced show’s work and tweak it a little bit to claim it as “original work”. In this sort of case, Kenja no Mago had committed both sins.<br />
<br />
The story of Kenja No Mago is by no means anything complicated whatsoever, but I guess I can add a bit more details for “context”.<br />
<br />
An unnamed Japanese salaryman gets killed by Mr. Truck-kun and is reincarnated into a fantasy world as an orphan, while still retaining his past memories. He is raised under the name “Shin” by a renowned elder magician and quickly displays his overpowered abilities in terms of both magic and martial arts, but apparently has a lack of common sense and social skills. On his 15th birthday, Shin is enrolled into a magic academy to befriend others and hone his already busted skills, but his raw talent makes it difficult to conduct a normal lifestyle as he quickly gained local celebrity status. The story is supposed to follow Shin’s high school life as he makes friends, learns about the world, and fights off evil that threatens him and the city.<br />
<br />
Now from first glance, the story, while generic, doesn’t seem like something particularly bad. It seemed like just a typical, harmless, “dumb fun” isekai fantasy. However, there is a clear lack of creativity from the get-go. Already we have an elephant in the room: the case of the overpowered main protagonist. Now overpowered main characters can still be well-written and complex as long as there’s proper establishment to the overall story and character depth and development. However, Shin has nothing to really make him stand out as unique; he’s your typical Gary Stu, an artificially manufactured husk of a protagonist, a physical manifestation of conveniently written plot armor and plot devices. The nature of his existence in the series means that the plot basically revolves around him and prevents any chance of innovation or development for the story and the other characters.<br />
<br />
But that’s not the only problem with the story. From what I was told, the original source material of Kenja No Mago is supposed to be more along the lines of slice-of-life fantasy. However, there is no sense of that in this adaptation, and the main culprit: a bad choice of PACING. The show apparently loves to speed through the events of the story so rapidly that it’s hard to really comprehend or understand what exactly is going on. What’s worse is that the show tries to hide those issues by inserting some awkward attempts at lighthearted comedy, which are basically hit-or-miss at best, and can come off as nothing but hindrances to the story as well as one’s enjoyment, depending on how one feels about the half-hearted “herp derp” gags. Most of these gags are, of course, revolving around Shin accidentally utilizing too much power and everyone getting shocked and sh**. Like, it’s literally one of those comedy skits where they have exaggerated faces and derpy character depictions…seriously, that’s not really funny at all after a while. It’s even worse in the final stretch when they try to utilize comedic gags in the more serious parts of the plot. They basically go to these gags where the baddies get all cocky and then get blown the f*** back, One Punch Man style. I would’ve been okay with this if the show was a parody isekai, but it really isn’t. The lack of innovation with the roles of the characters and the course of the story prevents that from being a possibility.<br />
<br />
Now about the romance going on between Shin and Sicily, the main heroine (apparently) that was featured in the show. While many people may say it’s nice to see a romantic relationship in a fantasy series be straightforward to where they actually kiss, I find it really hard to comprehend the authenticity of it. Shin and Sicily’s relationship felt very superficial and too convenient; there is no sense of good dynamics or chemistry between the two that would make me really care about their affinity for each other. It’s mostly them doing all these mushy gushy gestures and cliché romance gags as well as having the other characters tease them about their relationship. It honestly feels…fake. Soulless. There is no effort implemented to really build a lot of appropriate content and structure to justify their implications of romance. There’s nothing to really make me feel like I should have any care about it as it seemed practically useless to the overall story, anyways.<br />
When the series does reach its serious content, especially in the final episodes, it doesn’t seem like anything particularly tense or unsettling. The presentation of it feels half-hearted yet forced at the same time…like all attempts at tension are painfully cringe with the forced screams of terror and the typical cockiness of the antagonists. The construction and depiction of the main villains is by no means any good. It’s your typical bland “muhahaha I’m so f***ing evil I can c** on myself” sort of bad guy here. He doesn’t even feel like a genuine villain, just some salty boy tacked onto the story to let our Gary Stu flex his muscles on. It’s also a poor choice to have the show just really end in the most cliché and predictable way: having the MCs and co. face off against the villains in an overplayed climax (well, if you wanna call it a climax). <br />
<br />
The animation in this show is subpar, considering that it’s coming from a studio like Silver Link. It&#039;s &quot;potato quality&quot; at best, if that&#039;s a proper way to put it. There were so many instances of where the sequences of the frames just feel hella awkward, especially during a lot of the action scenes. The comedy scenes, whether or not it’s done on purpose, had a lot of moments where the characters’ expressions look heavily exaggerated or derpy, to where they can seem somewhat like stick figure drawings. The designs of the characters and the settings are all very typical and not something that can really catch someone’s attention. In fact, I found out that the settings of the world look almost EXACTLY the same as in Konosuba. Even, Shin and Sicily share too many visual similarities to Kazuma and Aqua, and the former basically stole Megumin’s “EXPLOSION”. While it’s not technically plagiarism, it’s a definite case of a knockoff/rip-off. I don’t even wanna talk about the ending of Episode 6….just what the actual f*** was that CGI eye-rape?? All in all, at best, the animation quality is nothing particularly notable or commendable.<br />
<br />
The soundtracks and sound effects are nothing worth of praise, either. The OP is so cheesy-sounding while the ED feels like a silly out-of-place impression that doesn’t really reflect the show at all. The voice-acting is unimpressive and at times hella annoying. I don’t think the VAs were even trying to implement any sort of genuine emotion. It’s more like as if they simply walked into the studio, read their lines without any notable expression, and leave on their merry way out knowing that the show is dismal but at least they can get paid just to show up. (P.S. Can I can please kill that Mary loli, please? Her voice is annoying as hell!)<br />
<br />
The characters I can ramble about all day, but it’s like beating a dead horse. Shin Walford, being the Gary Stu he is, received no sense of actual character development or maturity; he doesn’t seem to have a strong opinion of his own, yet somehow has to overreact and get angry when the frigging generic-as-hell villain shows up. The whole thing regarding him “not having any social skills or common sense” and “having his past memories” have been made irrelevant. Like what was the point, anyway? You could’ve written him without the whole “common sense” and “past memories” shenanigans and the script for him would be almost exactly the same. His social awkwardness is an excuse, and only serves to feed the gags involving him, which would’ve been fine if the jokes actually hit their marks. There’s no extra depth or dimensions to him…the one case where he feels bad for having killed someone doesn’t have any significant sense of empathic value and is a weak attempt to get us as an audience to pity him making that choice. All the support characters get no sense of development whatsoever. The main villain wasn’t very compelling, either. Considering how rushed the show was already by the time they get to him for the final episodes, dropping nearly an entire episode featuring flashbacks of his backstory was a poor choice and attempt to try to get us to think he’s a competent villain we should been sympathizing with.<br />
<br />
I would want to talk my enjoyment level more regarding this show, but I’ve already made it clear with the previous explanations. I tried. I really tried to enjoy this show. I tried to lower my standards and enjoy it as just one of those “fast food” isekai/fantasy seasonals. But the “fast food” delivered to me here was so stale that I can’t even savor it. Not even copious amounts of sauce or condiments could save the foundations of this one. Yes, I ended up throwing up all over the floor with this one.<br />
<br />
Kenja No Mago is an exemplification of how to NOT write a fantasy show or adaptation. It’s extremely passable and forgettable due to its conglomeration of simplistic themes, regurgitated tropes, underwhelming to bad animation quality, and non-existent innovation and creativity. Whatever identity this show tried to be, it wasn’t a good showcase at all worth watching. It&#039;s just another copy-pasta cashgrab show and only succeeds from a business standpoint. You’re better off watching some other fantasy with actual competent writing and interesting characters. Trust me with this. You’ll thank me later!<br />

    Before we get started, I know what you&#039;re thinking. 8? You&#039;re giving this absolute cliche an 8 out of 10? Yes. Yes I am. I&#039;ll also have you know that I dropped both &quot;That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime&quot; and &quot;Overlord&quot;! *horrified, distant shrieking*<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s why:<br />
<br />
Kenja no Mago knows what it is— an unoriginal story filled with one-dimensional characters told through average animation, sound, etc. That being said, it does an unexpectedly great job of not annoying me. Our hero Shin is a bit dense, but not excessively so. It has its uncomfortable, ecchi moments (looking at you, bidet scene), but it&#039;s no Hajimete

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309591">
        no Gal. It even briefly features gore and horror elements, but its overall tone is lighthearted. You&#039;ll get one scene setting up for a serious crisis, immediately followed by a PowerPoint transition with sparkly SFX into the next scene. Hell, the OP is straight out of a slice of life, yet the ED is edgy shonen all the way.<br />
<br />
&quot;So then it&#039;s all over the place! What&#039;s it trying to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#039;s exactly right! It&#039;s all over the place, it&#039;s awkward, and it&#039;s stupid as hell, but it&#039;s really, truly fun to watch. If you&#039;re looking for the perfect isekai that breaks the mold, run away and never look back.<br />
But where Re:Creators, Slime, and Overlord tried something new and lost my attention, Kenja no Mago is the definition of generic and I&#039;m loving every second of it.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a guilty pleasure show. Just kick back, grab some popcorn, and don&#039;t think too hard. Maybe take a drink every time someone says how goddamn amazing Shin is.

    Wooooow......Wooooooooooow. This is bad. This is real bad. <br />
<br />
Problem 1, The Gary Stu:<br />
Usually when you write a story there are certain pitfalls you want to avoid. One of them is the Mary Sue, alternatively called Gary Stu for males. A gary Stu is a character that doesn&#039;t have any flaws and is really strong or talented at whatever you have to be talented in in their specific story in order to be successful. When you write a Gary Stu character it&#039;s hard to make people empathize with him as he never has to struggle for anything. On top of that as there is never anything

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307575">
        at stake, no tension is ever built up and nothing dramatic that is exciting to watch can ever happen. <br />
                         <br />
This is actually quite an easy pitfall to avoid and is basically character writing 101: just make your character not be good at absolutely everything. This story absolutely ignores that and makes our dear MC super OP. He&#039;s a genius magician whos just naturally talented at magic, in the world he lives in magic is power and someone who is good at magic can become anything they want in life, he&#039;s also good looking and charms 2 women simultaneously in the first episode by beating up a bunch of generic bad guys (nice another generic harem isekai). He&#039;s also super positive, loved by everyone and has no mental issues or trauma despite literally being ran over and killed in his past life. TL;DR? He&#039;s a Gary Stu whos good at everything and has never struggled in his entire life. Seriously, this is such an easy thing to avoid even, One Punch Man, a dude who can literally one-shot anything, isn&#039;t a Gary Stu!<br />
<br />
Problem 2, Silver spoons: <br />
There is wrong with wealthy characters. Bruce Wayne is wealthy and he is one of the most iconic superheroes of all time. Growing up with a silverspoon shoved up your *** can obviously make for interesting characters as well, however. When a life of wealth, social and economic, is combined with Gary Stu-ism you get what might probably be the most boring and unwatchable character in human history. That is exactly what the MC of this anime Shin Walford is. Not only is he naturally talented at everything, he was also raised by the lands greatest hero, his partner, the literal king of the country he lives in, a famous knight and others! This is absurd! All this of course results in Shin being the most boring, uninteresting and unwatchable MC of all time as he has 0 problems in life. <br />
<br />
Supporting cast and setting are also trash:<br />
We have a generic magic-school setting where student are ranked based on their capabilities as magicians (wow, never seen that before). We have two girls who are literally introduced as damsels in distress that shin (the MC) has too swoop in and save, one of them immediately falls in love with him. A Draco Malfoy type character that literally fills no other purpose then further showing how strong Shin is and setting up the villain slightly(not saying Malfoy is a bad character, i’m saying that the character filling the same role in this anime is bad). <br />
<br />
Lastly, we have a villain. Man he&#039;s boring, so boring. You know what i hate? Villains who are evil just for the sake of it. No rhyme or reason, no philosophy guiding them, no event which molded them. I hate villains who are just evil for the sake of being evil. This is because there is nothing for me to relate to, no way for me to understand them or become invested.They&#039;re just there because the MC needs an antagonist. Also, this guy is not intimidating or anything in the least. He gets hurt by Shin (the MC) and struggles against him in their first encounter. He&#039;s unrelatable, uninteresting and intimidating at the same time. <br />
<br />
Last words:<br />
There’s nothing left to say, Shin just swoops in with his overpowered magic everywhere and succeeds at everything he tries, this is not fun too watch. If the MC and main story of a show is this bad then it doesn&#039;t matter what merits the rest of the show have to stand on, which are none, btw. This is just a generic and uninspired magic-school anime. There is no point in addressing specific plotpoints in the anime although there are many which further illustrate why this show is so bad. This is because the fundamental aspects of the show (characters, story and setting for example) all fail and are so mediocre and overdone that the show collapses on a foundational level. I’m not telling you too not enjoy mediocrity, blandness and bad writing as a guilty pleasure, just don’t praise it. <br />

    The Isekai genre has a problem.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a problem that has been going on ever since 2016 with the release of Konosuba and Re:Zero. It is also a problem that more often or not ruins the industry image from outsiders as many people from other mediums would say that the anime medium is vapid shit that has no substance base on the self insert/waifu pandering that were shown by various Isekai anime.<br />
<br />
Wise Man&#039;s Grandchild is the embodiment of this as it&#039;s not only a horrendously made anime that is void of passion and creativity it also shamelessly represents everything that is wrong with this genre.<br />
<br />
The plot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311416">
        centres around a self insert Gary Sue named Shin Walford who is reincarnated as a baby in a fantasy world after getting ran over and killed by truck kun in his previous life. He is soon adopted by an old wander named Merlin Walford and soaked up Merlin&#039;s teachings, earning him some shocking powers and abilities; however when he turned 15 Merlin realised that he forgot to teach him quote &quot;Common sense and social skills&#039;. Unquote. I wish I joking.<br />
<br />
Anyway with the help of Merlin&#039;s friend Shin enrols into Shin into a prestigious magic academy where he can not only socialise with people but to also hone his skills and abilities. Thus he&#039;s adventures begin.<br />
<br />
If I had to describe the story in one world is lazy. You know when you have that one 12 year old in class that constantly shares their bad anime fanfics to you.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s what this show is. It&#039;s a collection of generic anime cliches and fantasy isekai story elements that don&#039;t mesh well together thanks to the shows vomit including writing which I will get to in a bit.<br />
<br />
There are no stakes whatsoever as the protagonist would overpowered the villains at any time. The setting is a generic boring setting before. There&#039;s no world-building to speak as the show rather spends it&#039;s time on sick self insert pandering.<br />
It wouldn&#039;t be so bad if the writing was so trash. You cannot watch a single episode of Wise Man&#039;s Grandchild without face slamming your head on a iron table.<br />
<br />
This is only enhanced by the 12-year-old tier fan fiction dialogue which was downright painful to watch on screen.<br />
The worst thing about Wise Man Grandchild is how lazy it is. I know I just described the story as lazy but this is only the thick of it as it not only rips off plots from other isekai/fantasy anime it also reuses locations with little to no changes.<br />
<br />
My favourite being Kazuma&#039;s Mansion as despite being slighting brighter as well-having adding and removing a couple of outdoor mansion decoration the mansion is the bloody same. I understand that drawing hundreds of backgrounds for an anime is hard, especially on a tight deadline and budget but nobody has been stupid enough to recuse background scenery from other isekai animes as plan B. It&#039;s like I&#039;m watching a anime equivalent of a asset flip of steam.<br />
<br />
The asset flip and poorly written story is made worse with the soulless characters are a void of personality.<br />
<br />
Shin is a boring Gary Sue who is overpowered and has no flaws.<br />
He has a personality of a brick and he has no motivations other to project his friends and city because plot reasons.<br />
<br />
The supporting characters are just a collection of bland anime stereotypes that you have all seen before.<br />
You have the shy blue hair girl with big boobs, the tsundere red hard girl, the yellow hair kindhearted best friend boy and couple of old farts. How lazy and uninspired can you get.<br />
Finally we have villains and to be honest the less I speak about them the better because you can tell what type of villains they are going to be based on the amateur hour poster that was done in Photoshop.<br />
<br />
The presentation is a mixed bag. While the animation is subpar and fight choreography at times is laughable the character designs, background scenery and lightning were pretty solid minus the stock images.<br />
The soundtrack had as much passion as the plot and characters. It uses various generic fantasy tracks that don&#039;t keep the viewer interested due to how bland they are.<br />
<br />
This is only made worse by poor direction as various times it doesn&#039;t know how to properly place it&#039;s own tracks to create tension to the fights and narrative.<br />
Both the opening and ending themes are generic pop songs with meaningless lyrics.<br />
<br />
The voice acting for both languages is alright but nothing too special.<br />
<br />
Wise Man&#039;s Grandchild.exe has stopped working.<br />
<br />
Wise Man&#039;s Grandchild is what happens when you have no creativity and passion. It is an infuriating garbage fire that relays on cliches and tropes just to please the lowest common denominator of anime fans with it&#039;s cringely dialogue and fan fiction writing.<br />
Wise Man&#039;s Grandchild may decent production values and voice acting but it ultimately don&#039;t matter if your plot and characters were at the bottom of the barrel.<br />
The only thing that you should do as Wise Man&#039;s Grandchild is concerned is to stay as far away from it as possible as this is just another Isekai anime that has no soul and passion. <br />
<br />
Avoid the series like the plague and watch That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime or Konosuba instead.

    Get rekted by an oncoming vehicle? Green swimwear?  Or hair style?  What does that have to do with all this?  Using pearls of wisdom like that is effective for deceiving readers?  Giving one value isn&#039;t that a little excessive?<br />
<br />
Shin was killed by a vehicle and a victim, at that time he experienced an unexpected event.  Just before his death he woke up from his sleep and repeated a life from the beginning.  Need to add more synopsis?  Of course not.  Come on, this is just a silly worksheet and what do you expect from this blank worksheet?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311400">
         Every season even every year they are not bored making the same theme.  Is the anime industry on the rise to the point of making the same masterpiece repeatedly?  Of course I&#039;m not not.  Forget about that, if from my point of view to be honest this is still far from a good word why is that?  Basically the &quot;isekai&quot; genre has a weak storyline and only contains happiness.  Why don&#039;t they try to make the same theme but have a strong storyline?  Are they afraid to compete in the market?  Of course, their strategy in market competition does not take risks, where the opportunity for profit and loss is inversely proportional.<br />
<br />
Are they not disgusted with their female main character?  Spoiled, useless, pretentious, and big breasted are you your type?  Sicily is a noble girl who falls in love at first sight after being saved by the main character, gosh how cheap she is.  Forgive me for insulting your lover, instead I will give one to your beloved &quot;I admit your lover is beautiful but is it useful when at home?&quot; The main character is very strong as if he can defeat the enemy with just one look.  the main character is no less funny why no one of them can understand a simple word, are they deaf? Magic is a science that is useful if swordsmanship can kill one person, then sorcery can kill ten people.  learning at school is a waste and is useless. They seem to be demonstrating magic, if they are magicians don&#039;t they use extraordinary moves? I think it&#039;s just circus trick<br />
<br />
Silver links are studios that often work on shows like this.  Image quality is arguably enough there is nothing good and nothing bad means standard.  To make anime production, it requires a cheap cost to be as bad as anything they make, I still appreciate it and can be called a work.  Character design is good especially Sicily, thank you for creating a waifuable character.  But what should be regretted is whether they chose the main female character wrong?  I think Maria is better to be the main female character.  She is beautiful, reliable, and smart.  It is inversely proportional to Sicily that can&#039;t do anything, but I also wonder why do you like characters like that?  Is it big breasted?  Come on, there are still many big-breasted women out there.<br />
<br />
What was your first thought when you heard an anime title?  what is the main character?  Or the opening theme?  I think these two things are very important because these two things are at the core of an anime.  As the title suggests, the opening theme is also titled magic but what is noteworthy is the script of the song itself is it good?  I think they are good enough in that field but why when juxtaposed with &quot;Iris&quot; becomes a mere departure?  however, to think of opening theme animations and determining song scripts is difficult and their hard work is commendable.

Either way, &quot;Isekai&quot; is a genre that most people like, myself, I don&#039;t blame them, however, this is their right and there is no prohibition on that.  No matter who they like and who they hate, we as human beings are thinking creatures, provided that in the end you win isn&#039;t that enough?<br />

    You know those dumb light novel anime if you have seen one you have seen them all. Normally I would stop watching them after the first 3 minutes, but for some reason, I stuck through this one, why? because it was so bad that I honestly enjoyed the first 2 episodes of it. the 3rd episode comes out and they sucked all the fun that it barely had. this show starts to take itself seriously. well, now I can not recommend it to anyone the first 2 episodes while they are somewhat enjoyable they are not really worth your time. on the other hand, if

        you enjoy the dumb light novel anime than this would surely be a nice addition to your collocation.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
Hi, My name is **** (I just finished the 4th episode cannot remember the main character name great!) I have a normal life. Shit, I am dead now time to start a new life in another world. It is a joke how this anime starts. I would love that if the anime was a pure comedy and parody anime. Did it have to be Isekai?. No, it is just to market this lovely show. the hero has to be overpowered, at least this time he doesn&#039;t have some sort of a thing that stops him from showing his huge Extreme power, I would give it that. the rest is just a normal magic school plot down to the teeth.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
Yes, it got art wow big deal.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
I never skip openings normally when I watch anime while it is airing this one I just couldn&#039;t stand. other than that it is just OK.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
I surely have never seen those characters in any other anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
first 2 I enjoyed them the other 2 were just boring really really boring.<br />

    &quot;Ah shit, here we go again.&quot;<br />
A spoiler-free review, by the way.<br />
<br />
Another isekai anime with a generic plot to satiate our trashy isekai desires. After watching its first four episodes, I can already tell that Kenja no Mago, in spite of the show being a mediocre, is trying hard to be something in the realm of the isekai genre but still indeed entertaining to watch.<br />
<br />
The first episodes of Kenja no Mago has demonstrated the capabilities of the protagonist, Shin Walford, and how broken and overpowered he is—a cheap trick to hype up the viewers but can be seen as dull and uninteresting by many. He is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307560">
        surrounded with peers which are inferior to him that shows high regards to his prowess, only making him look more powerful, yet ironically lacks common sense. These kind of concept has become way too overused, mostly in the isekai genre, which can be questioned for its ingenuity. Heck, even how the protagonist has died in the accident as shown in the first episode is so cliché to the point that it has become iconic to the anime community. <br />
<br />
But what makes Kenja no Mago still worthy to watch is how enjoyable the show is. Its generic plot aside, thinking of Shin as yourself, dying in an accident and getting reincarnated into another world and then becoming an overpowered protagonist, is a pretty cool thing for me. The concept of escapism which has got nothing to do with the anime itself is what making me enjoy watching Kenja no Mago—putting yourself in the shoes of the protagonist where you are capable of being anything you want to be with your own power in the new world no matter how repetitious this idea becomes.<br />
<br />
Kenja no Mago is not for everyone who does not like the repetitiveness of the concept of an overpowered protagonist and generic plot. I do suggest, though, to watch the show and at least give it a try (three episode rule) to see if it comes within your liking.<br />
<br />
<br />
To sum up the quality of the show:<br />
<br />
Story - 5 <br />
Some of the scenes are not narrated well and cliché.<br />
<br />
Art - 6 <br />
Art style seems average and the animations are not even that good enough for an action anime.<br />
<br />
Sound - 6 <br />
Soundtracks are quite average as well.<br />
<br />
Character - 6<br />
Generic characterization; inferior supporting characters that makes the main character look more powerful.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10<br />
Although with its quality, the show itself is enjoyable for my part. No further explanation needed.<br />
<br />
Overall - 7<br />

    If a 5 year old asked me to explain what “Kenja no Mago” is, I can easily sum it as “isekai trash”. They may not understand the term ‘isekai’ at first, but they know what trash is. It’s a shame for me to say this because Kenja no Mago could have been an actual hit, something special even. What it ended up instead is garbage that I doubt even a 5 year old can enjoy.<br />
<br />
Without jumping too far ahead, the isekai genre often consists of several ways to set up for is main story. The protagonist usually gets transported to an alternate world. In some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311403">
        cases, they meet their tragic deaths at the hands of Truck-kun. They gain some sort of RPG-like power by some mysterious entity. From there on, the protagonist lives in their new lifestyle while making new friends, enemies, lovers, etc. Oh and before I forget, isekai usually loves to go with harem involving female characters who wants to get into the main guy’s pants. It’s the sort of dead horse ideas that makes many isekai shows as blend as they are today. Kenja no Mago has a protagonist named Shin Walford who used to be a hardworking man in the real world. He gets killed by Truck-kun, reincarnated in a fantasy world, and grew up to be a strong person. This sound sort of familiar now? Oh wait, I forgot to mention that Shin is ungodly powerful for someone of his age. Make no mistake, Shin is an overpowered protagonist who shows little vulnerability. He’s like the Hulk Hogan of the early 1980s and isn’t going to put over anyone. <br />
<br />
Watching the story start off this way already set offs some red flags. Honestly, Shin isn’t much of an appealing protagonist to begin with. The show makes it clear that he lacks social skills and this is thanks to being raised in the wilderness. My first impression of Shin is that he is a young man trapped in a toddler’s body. Except here, Shin is stupidly powerful. His first encounter with the timid Sicily girl is laughably awkward. It’s one of those ‘love at first sight’ moments as both characters fall for each other. To put it bluntly, it seems the creator didn’t want to build on their relationship together. It’s just handing it over. It doesn’t help that she is extremely shy who often puts on her embarrassing face whenever getting close to her knight in shining armor. This isn’t a ‘will they or won’t they’ scenario type of story. This is just Shin and Sicily destined to be lovers like it’s some sort of fake Cinderella tale. I wish it was much more than that.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, the show contains more than these two lovebirds. From the main cast, there’s August von Earshide, Maria von Messina, May von Earsheid, Alice Corner, Lyn Hughes, Yuri Carlton, Oliver Schtrom, and among others. If you guessed it, then yes, some of these characters came from noble families. Because in fantasy worlds, there are what people call ‘status’. Shin is enrolled in a prestigious school to develop his social skills. What does that really mean? Well, it means this show is saturated with goofy moments and absurd amount of comedy. Honestly, I wonder what this anime tries to even be sometimes. A parody? I don’t think so since it doesn’t truly satirize the isekai genre. Konosuba did that with fantastic results. Then, it got me wondering if the anime is trying to bring something fresh to the audience. That can’t be yet either since the amount of ideas listed can be fit with any isekai shows nowadays. So what the hell is this show trying to be? <br />
<br />
Then, I realized something. The real problem with Kenja no Mago is it’s just plainly stupid. That’s the simplest way to describe it. It tries so hard to be funny that it loses its focus. Even with the serious storytelling on occasions, the comedy immediately puts the anime back to square one. Character such as Oliver Schtrom had my interest at first but after seeing him fall in despair and his true intentions, he became nothing more than archetype villain; not the creative type either. In fact, a 5 year old could make up a villain about as interesting as Oliver. The rest of the cast are hardly interesting with August’s casualness or Maria’s outspoken personality and fangirling over others. Characters such as Alice or May display childishness that gets in the way of others. And of course, there is Silciy and Yuri. The show seeks to make both of them look as attractive as possible. For Silcily’s case, it’s to make her look like a lovely doll with the elegance of a stereotypical young lady. In Yuri’s case, the show gives her cleavage as Ms. Fanservice. Almost every shot I see her in the show makes it seem like the camera is flirting with her. When you get a main cast like this, there’s little room for creativity. The adults are even less interesting with their formal ways of speaking. Trust me, it’s like listening your least favorite music on repeat.<br />
<br />
With Silver Link in charge, I had to lower my expectations a bit before the anime started. The promos and visual content reveals a generic style for its character designs. Even the battle segments in the show gets tedious fast because you can almost guess who will win. The character expressions are too cartoonish to be taken for laughs. It’s like the Disney type of humor aimed for children if that’s the target audience. In the meantime, I can’t even give much praise to the voice acting. With characters like Shin with a lack of social skills, the lines also sound laughably absurd. Creatively speaking, there’s some room for world building as it sticks to its core fantasy elements. At the same time, I do want to give some praise to its magical content as well. There’s a diverse range of magic in the show that makes an isekai be what it is. <br />
<br />
Oh Kenja no Mago. This is not a show I would recommend people unless you’re under 12 years old. It’s the type of anime that anyone could’ve written with no creative thought. To be honest, you can watch this anime at 2x times the speed and feel like you won’t miss much in the end. If Nobunaga-sensei no Osanazuma is the worst show of the year so far, it looks like it has some competition.

    Kenja no mago is one of those generic isekai that turn out tedious due to taking the fantasy fulfillment element to an overblown extreme. IMO it falls into the same category as &quot;Isekai wa smartphone&quot; and &quot;Death March to the parallel World&quot;, so if you could bring yourselves to like these then you&#039;ll probably like this one as well.<br />
<br />
Story: 1<br />
<br />
The premise is a generic cliche at best. The MC is an adult who gets ran over by our good ol&#039; friend &quot;truck-kun&quot; and then gets reincarnated in another world as a baby. <br />
<br />
Now the &quot;cringy&quot; part is that the MC, even as a child, retains

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307573">
        his memories as an adult-- and while this serves as the secret ability behind his rapid growth and eventual recognition as &quot;Child Prodigy&quot;, it keeps rubbing me the wrong way whenever he interacts with his peers.<br />
<br />
All the girls are flocking to him, powerful wizards are astonished by his skill at such a young age, because none of them are aware of the fact he&#039;s an adult in a kid&#039;s body. I don&#039;t even want to touch the &quot;flirting&quot; part, considering those girls are actual teens while he&#039;s a full grown adult in a teen&#039;s body. Yeah...<br />
<br />
Art: 5<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not entirely bad, but it&#039;s rushed and that becomes apparent in frequent sequences. I&#039;d say it&#039;s your standard isekai anime quality.<br />
<br />
Sound: 3<br />
<br />
90% of the times the tracks that start playing don&#039;t fit the scene at all. It&#039;s so weird it makes one wonder what the studio was even thinking when implementing those soundtracks. I&#039;ve seen much worse though.<br />
<br />
Character: 1<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start with the MC. He&#039;s your generic, OP, Gary-Stu, likable by everyone child prodigy that can just resolve any issue with a finger-snap. The one issue the MC cannot fix is that there&#039;s no one who can really challenge him. He&#039;s ridiculously broken to the point even the villain-mastermind in the early episodes runs away in fear of the MC&#039;s latent potential. That can play out either way, I guess. You can either like an MC who can just fart his problems away or you can just feel bored by his power-farts.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of the cast about everyone is 1-dimensional, much like the MC. They don&#039;t feel real and there&#039;s nothing likable, memorable or interesting about them. They feel like meat-puppets created for the sole purpose of reacting to the MC&#039;s dialogue without having a personality of their own. <br />
<br />
This becomes more apparent on episode 3, where the MC decapitates a demonized fellow student and the first thing everyone is concerned about is the dust on the MC&#039;s shirt. Nobody seems to care or even notice their dead classmate&#039;s headless corpse that&#039;s lying right next to them. On that particular scene I remember asking myself what the hell was wrong with those kids, not even reacting to a fellow classmate&#039;s death, but then I just remembered they were 1-dimensional puppets created for the purpose of worshiping the MC and nothing else. Their characters are so bland and superficial that honestly Goblin-Slayer feels like a multi-dimensional character compared to them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1<br />
<br />
Like I said, it can go either way. Personally I can&#039;t seem to get any enjoyment out of this show due to reasons I already mentioned. It just feels bland and empty in uncomfortably many ways.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a ton of isekais out there that did the &quot;OP MC&quot; part right. Take Overlord or Slime for example. IMO Kenja no Mago failed at delivering that premise and instead turned out with a senselessly powerful MC that just needs to flex in order to make the world a better place.<br />
<br />
TL;DR you should just avoid this one.

    ~Please don&#039;t watch this show, it just encourages and validates that these studios can pump out something this garbage and do good.~<br />
<br />
This is just about the most cliche, generic anime I&#039;ve ever seen. I want to almost believe it&#039;s a parody because it&#039;s so badly cliche. It&#039;s like an off-brand generic copy of a name brand show.<br />
<br />
Every instance is so predictable and cliche that it&#039;s almost embarrassing to watch, I actually physically cringed for the first time ever watching this show  at some of the scenes; one of the scenes was so obviously predictable that when it happened, I almost clicked out of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307678">
        show to drop it. It was like a line of predictable scenes and every time I predicted something I just got so disappointed.<br />
<br />
I do typically like how these types of stories go but this show is so stereotypical and bad that it lacks any character and depth to the story.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not saying the story type is bad, because I typically enjoy these types of stories actually, but even the lines in the anime felt rushed and boring and the way the show has rushed through these episodes to barely make an effort to be unique or tell the story in a more engaging way really turns me off. It&#039;s like they took the most generic, basic bits of any Isekai and just put it in one show, this is basically what you would get.<br />
<br />
I want to also say I don&#039;t make reviews because I don&#039;t see the purpose in anyone really valuing my opinion, but the show was so bad that I was 100% positive it would have been rated nothing higher than a 5 or 6 on MAL but it turns out it wasn&#039;t surprisingly somehow a mid to high 7. For the first time I&#039;m actually shocked and disappointed a bad show that is this appalling got even a half decent rating. <br />
<br />
*SPOILERS*<br />
Sizilien is the typical basic &quot;cute&quot; character that immediately falls for the main character, and of course there is something about her that makes the MC swoop in to save her.<br />
<br />
MC is incredibly OP and charming and everything goes in his favor basically which is just so boring. Of course there&#039;s an antagonist he comes across that is the typical snobby royalty that absolutely hates the MC with the most cliche antagonist. <br />
<br />
Also to note, how nice is it that just about everyone important in the MC&#039;s life is an important legendary person that everyone knows and praises.<br />
*SPOILERS END*<br />

    This is the worst anime I&#039;ve ever seen in my entire life. I&#039;ve made it through Sword Art Online, Vampire Knight, Eromanga-sensei, and even fucking King&#039;s Game, and this is the one that broke me. I smiled 2 times, and they were both at parts that weren&#039;t trying to be funny. There&#039;s nothing good about this show at all. I&#039;m writing this review at episode 8 because that&#039;s the farthest I&#039;m letting myself get to; for my own sake, I can&#039;t continue.<br />
<br />
Story (1/10)<br />
The story is 100% cliches. You can genuinely predict every single thing that happens before it happens. The relationship between Kiri2 and GENERIC-GIRL-CHAN-5000

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309878">
        has 2 steps:<br />
1. &quot;Ummmmm it&#039;s not like I like GENERIC-GIRL-CHAN-5000 or anything....&quot;<br />
2. ENGAGEMENT<br />
Sure, there&#039;s some other storyline with some bad guy doing bad stuff but that stuff is genuinely relevant for about 7% of the entire show from ep1-8. Some guy does something bad so that Kiri2 can fix it and become the hero that everyone loves. Then every so often in an episode, they&#039;re like &quot;oh right, there&#039;s that villain who&#039;s still alive,&quot; so they show a minute of him doing Evil Nefarious Plotting, and then it&#039;s back to the least likable characters existing in random places.<br />
<br />
Art (3/10)<br />
The facial features are never in the same spot, and I swear to god GENERIC-GIRL-CHAN-5000 has bigger eyes in every consecutive shot she appears in. They spent 90% of the budget on 2 second explosions and then the rest of the rest of the environments can be summed up as such:<br />
SKY LAYER<br />
MOUNTAIN LAYER<br />
STONE GROUND LAYER<br />
This isn&#039;t even mentioning the one episode where they decided to have maybe the most hilariously awful CGI vocaloid music videos I&#039;ve ever seen, and I&#039;ve seen Ayano&#039;s Theory of Happiness&#039;s anime CGI video. A girl hops around while whacky and zaney effects pop around screen, she gives some half-hearted dabs (not a joke), and then it&#039;s over. I was stunned. I didn&#039;t know what to do with myself. I was still for so long that my muscles began to atrophy and the doctors weren&#039;t sure I was gonna make it.<br />
<br />
Sound (3/10)<br />
I did actually get a little bit into episode 9, and one of the things that made me start to break was when there was an explosion noise and I recognized it. I had heard it from either some 2014 youtube video or unity game, and it is maybe the worst sound known to man. It was like nails on a chalk board. The opening is fine at best, and the same can be said about the ending. Every single background song in the OST has 2 instruments. I can&#039;t remember a single song because every song is just like if you took an &quot;item get&quot; jingle from a game and then made it 2 minutes long.<br />
<br />
Character (1/10)<br />
Every character has 1 personality trait. Kiri2 is dumb as a post but good at magic. GENERIC-GIRL-CHAN-5000 loves Kiri2 and has a HUMAN GENTLE SOUL. Red hair girl is a tsundere but to like everyone??? God it actually hurts to fucking think about these terrible characters, the entire show is the equivalent of eating cardboard as entertainment while watching paint dry.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (0.1/10)<br />
The thing about the anime that I listed at the start of this review is that they all are at least either good in concept, funny because of how bad they are, have good production quality, or at least have good songs (and maybe a combo of some of these), but the simple truth is that Wise Man&#039;s Grandson has absolutely 0 redeeming qualities. It&#039;s not even so bad that I can laugh at it. Everything is cliched; nothing is original. My brain hurts just thinking about it because it&#039;s just so mind numbingly boring that the cells in my brain just start to turn off entirely so as to not be used for thinking about something so wholly terrible.<br />
<br />
Overall (0/10)<br />
I&#039;d give this a negative score if I was able to. This has a better score than fucking Boogiepop. I&#039;m genuinely afraid that some countries will begin to use this show as a torture tactic. That&#039;s the type of experience you&#039;re in for if you have a lapse in judgment for a long enough duration of time that you press play on Wise Man&#039;s Grandson. Never watch it; this is for your own sake. I&#039;m begging you.

    So far all I can say is this is one of the worst anime that I have seen. Personally I had high hopes for this anime and only watched the latest episode in hopes that it would improve. I don&#039;t write reviews often but I felt I had to for this one. There is no story so far and you can forget about character development. The story seems like some poor self insert fan-faction. The character seem to lack inelegance and have no flaws not to mention the poor pacing of the show. There are many pointless scenes, and no show/anime will ever be perfect

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307588">
        I had high hopes for this and while it may be bad I did enjoy the first episode and I still hope they make improvements but as of now every time I watch        a new episode I just get reminded of why I don&#039;t want to keep watching Kenja no Mago. I&#039;d say give it a try but lower your expectations.

    Oh no! Another isekai harem show that does not bring anything new to the table and is just lost in the sea of all the other isekai harem shows that the industry is already pumping out!  That was definitely what I was thinking when I saw the genre, poster, and synopsis.  But this anime proved itself otherwise.  Do not come into this anime expecting for a complex plot with heavily fleshed out characters.  This show was designed to fool you into thinking that it follows the usual anime tropes but suddenly it pulls out something totally unconventional.  It&#039;s not exactly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311521">
        a parody of the isekai genre, to me it&#039;s better than that.  This is a show that initially pokes fun at the very overpowered MC showing it&#039;s prowess at comedy but suddenly dives into romance, drama, and action at such an incredible pace that it actually does not destroy the comedy built at the start.  <br />
<br />
Definitely try this anime if you&#039;re looking to just relax and watch a show that is not only very funny, but having an MC that&#039;s dense and not that dense at the same time; coupled with a cast that may be a bit shallow but definitely enriches the anime.

    LIKE: I like the concept of having ability to die in one world and be reborn in another with memory in tack, thus giving an advantage<br />
<br />
DISLIKE: I like how the MC has knowledge of science he learned here on earth and use it to enhance his magic in the new world, but I DISLIKE how MC seems to forget how to handle certain social situations. (MC was a grown up, young adult, lets say 25 years old on earth, plus 15 years in new world) MC has 40 years of living experience yet he still acts like a kid that is only 15 years old...
