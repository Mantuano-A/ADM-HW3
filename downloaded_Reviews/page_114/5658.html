    Overview:<br />
<br />
It&#039;s the 4th of July everybody! As an American, I will celebrate my country with one of our time honored traditions...beating the dog shit out of something weak and defenseless. Everyone is lining up to shit on Eromanga Sensei. Worst animu of the year! Sure that&#039;s pretty low hanging fruit, but I&#039;m going even lower. If bashing Eromanga Sensei was the equivalent of America&#039;s pummeling and carving up Serbia, picking on poor Berserk 2017 is like the 1983 invasion of Grenada! <br />
<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Berserk 2017 has 2 clip show episodes in a 12 episode run! That&#039;s really all I need to say to illustrate how fucking shit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251977">
        this series was. That could be the entire review right there!<br />
<br />
However, I&#039;m a tad more professional then that so let&#039;s get on with the review.  This series covered the part of the manga where Guts meets Schierke, gains the Berserker Armor, and fights the New Band of the Hawk. Basically this is the part of the manga where Miura abandons the &quot;Ow the Edge&quot; feel of the Black Swordsman Arc and makes Berserk a shonen with occasional tits and gore. I&#039;m exaggerating of course, but the tone has changed vastly and it often seems to almost venture into shonen territory. This SHOULD make it easier to adapt into a fun and fluid anime right? Unfortunately it would seem not. They cover very little of the manga in these 12 episodes, not only because there are 2 fucking clip shows, but because the pacing isn&#039;t great. If they were going to make it short and sweet, they could at least put serious attention and detail into the battle scenes. However, the art budget got gutted AGAIN, so this series often looks even worse than Berserk 2016! The battle scenes are predictably lackluster, so we mostly get padding and dialogue. Does it even end at the logical point with Guts gaining the Berserker armor and standing tall against Griffith&#039;s minions? Nope. The series rushed that scene and farted on for another episode so we could meet Bonebeard the Pirate...the character near universally considered to be the worst character in all of Berserk. Yes, he&#039;s worse than Puck. Since this series bombed and there are no plans for a Berserk 2018, this is where the Berserk anime journey ends...with Bonebeard the fucking Pirate! I don&#039;t know whether to laugh or cry.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
If you had told me last year that Berserk 2017 would look even worse than 2016 I wouldn&#039;t have believed you. How could they possibly sink further down when they had reached the center of the Earth?  From that point, any direction would be up. However, Studio Gemba has accomplished the unthinkable. There are a lot of anime studios I love to give shit: Toei, ARMS, 4C, OLM, etc. Those are all GODLIKE though compared to Gemba. Only Idea Factory can compete head to head with Gemba when it comes to being an absolute shitstain of an animation company.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Were my expectations high following last years&#039; travesty? Nope. Was I STILL somehow disappointed by this trash? Yep. Berserk 2017 isn&#039;t even good as a guilty pleasure. Keep in mind my standards aren&#039;t that high. Dragonball Super is something I watch as a guilty pleasure. Berserk 2017 is to Berserk what Superman 4 was to Superman films. It is a blow so devastating that it may never recover. As successful a cult following as the manga has, it will likely be YEARS before we see another attempt at a Berserk anime if ever.

    I will say this in advance, if you judge the flaws too much your enjoyment will spoil. I highly suggest you rather go into this knowing that it&#039;s going to be the exact CG and features as last season or continue being a perfectionist and be very disappointed. It&#039;s the simple matter of knowing what to expect. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s a &quot;episodic&quot; section and a &quot;features &amp; info&quot; section. The () with numbers in them represents spoilers for the spoiler paragraph. If you want, check out the stats paragraph that goes through the current and previous stats. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
**************************************************************<br />
FEATURES &amp; INFO<br />
<br />
<br />
ANIMATION/ART/MOVEMENT:<br />
So we know that it&#039;s CG, however there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246276">
        is more to it than you might think. The 2D, 3D, art, pace and movement is gonna be looked upon this season. The question is, has it changed for the better? Yes, but not entirely. The character details of random people can look very lazy in some cases. They don&#039;t get enough screen time so I understand, though you will notice it. <br />
The characters look the same, but this time it&#039;s easier to take in.<br />
The art can be beautiful, this includes the scenery and general use. The art isn&#039;t perfect so just keep that in mind.<br />
The movement is very frustrating, especially in the background. The background characters comes to an absolute stop at several occasions and it just ruins the mood. Taking 4:33-4:38 from episode 8 for example, the movement of the characters that should be moving just stopped (7). In any case, it will become easier to handle the CG. Unless your allergic to CG.<br />
<br />
CAMERA:<br />
The angles are fine but sometime it can be over used.  When the camera moves from showing the characters face to a position just behind them, viewing what the character sees... it can get a little old. This is only me though, I notice the camera movement much more for this anime compared to everything else I&#039;ve watched. The camera angles and movement is much better than the prequel, I would rate it a 7/10. So far the anime doesn&#039;t have any filler, but that doesn&#039;t mean they don&#039;t skip minor details. Scenes get rushed every so often, of course it&#039;s to fit more material.<br />
<br />
MUSIC/SOUND:<br />
The music is important to anime and this anime was spot on in this area. The opening and ending is something to look forward to. The Sound effects are more or less the same but I like the sound of Guts sword in particular. The soundtracks are the same and good as ever. In episode 3 at 6:49-7:53 the soundtrack was perfect for the scenery and speech, even though this soundtrack has been used in the other Berserk anime it still was lovely. The voice actors/actresses work well with the characters, no flaws at all in the voices. There may be some characters that will grow on you due to the VA. Seeing Puck and ...... fighting with voices was much more enjoyable compared to the Manga (5). The sound is one of the best aspects of this anime, without the soundtracks and songs... It wouldn&#039;t be as great.<br />
<br />
MY ENJOYMENT:<br />
Seeing my favorite manga adapted is very very exciting, I have been waiting for this for a long time. As I stated I was disappointed, yet I enjoyed it so much that I can re-watch it anytime. I always get shivers down my spine from just watching the opening and a few moments during the episodes. For the opening I like the art and basically how it was made. Just seeing the animation and movements of the white and black still characters is satisfying enough for me. I admit the manga is better but I need music and voices, I don&#039;t care about these peoples criticism.<br />
<br />
MY THOUGHTS:<br />
&quot;What can anime do that manga can&#039;t? What by definition is possible through the medium of animation that is not possible by a series of printed pictures on paper (manga)?&quot;. This here is what I think that keeps lot&#039;s of people going, the color, sound and movement. This is a good point about the anime, it has these things that the Manga doesn&#039;t have. Does it mean it&#039;s better than the Manga? No. Does it mean that we get to hear voices we only imagined in our heads? Yes. Anyway I&#039;m just happy we have gotten this far in the anime.<br />
<br />
The quote in the paragraph above was originally written by another user, I got his permission to add this to my review.<br />
<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION:<br />
This season looks better than the prequel, mostly the camera angles and music. It&#039;s definitely worth watching. It&#039;s possible that you will find this very entertaining like me. Remember it still has big flaws.                                   <br />
<br />
**************************************************************                           <br />
EPISODIC<br />
<br />
<br />
FIRST EPISODE:<br />
The first 2 minutes of the first episode was perfectly done. From 00:07-2:07, the art was amazing and the 2D animation worked perfectly for it (Since I was using kissanime the time may vary. It&#039;s about a 6 second difference without KA). The characters had faded lines near their body parts just like the previous season but it was no doubt 2D. This was a perfect start to the anime and the opening after that scene made it even better, especially listening to another 9mm Parabellum Bullet song. Just as you finish watching the opening you will undoubtedly come upon the same CG animation as the prequel. To be frank, it was kind of disappointing. I knew what I was going into but I was unable to prevent thinking, &quot;What would Berserk look like if it wasn&#039;t CG&quot;. The CG can get rather inadequate, yet it does grow on you. Look, I&#039;m going to be straight forward with this... seeing the 3D characters talking and moving was very unsatisfying. It&#039;s possible that this episode will worry you for the upcoming episodes, but rest assured it does get better. During 09:07-15:50 there is a big fight. In that big fight at 10:17-10:19, 11:06-11:43, Guts and someone else clashes swords several of times (1). For this fight it was said to be swords clashing in repeated motions. I reduced the speed to 0.15 to confirm what a youtuber (Professor Anime) said, on the end he was half right.  At 19:32-20:30 the scene had a mixture of 2D and 3D, specifically at 19:53-20:30 was just 2D. I couldn&#039;t ask for anything better for that bloody scene (when I said bloody I mean blood rushing out of a head and arrow shots). That short battle scene was much better than how the movies executed them. Another good animation scene was at 21:20-21:35, it was superior to all of the prequels moments. Presumably, by now you know that Berserk has it&#039;s fair share of 2D scenes, but this is very limited to just close up&#039;s and short scenes. <br />
<br />
SECOND EPISODE:<br />
At 3:44-4:30, a demon (call it what you want) appeared and I must say that the animation was crap. I just didn&#039;t buy it, it was like it was cut out straight out of the manga and just put in 3D without bothering putting in better details in it. At 6:02-16:15 it was a flashback of ****** past, for the whole 10 minutes it was 2D (2). The content in that 10 minutes was very important since it was clearing up that uncertainty about ******  that&#039;s been going on since the prequel. Making the flashback with the 2D was what made this episode successful. At 20:34-21:00 it was missing one thing... it was nipples. It&#039;s got nothing to do with my sexual desire, it&#039;s what I think would work for such a moment. I would like to see more mature scenes because this is Berserk after all.<br />
<br />
THIRD EPISODE: <br />
At 16:35-18:22 this was the area where I was most worried, but I was impressed. The soundtrack worked very well with the scene and the animation wasn&#039;t a burden to the content at all. At the scene there was a bunch of demons in a cave, it could of gone so wrong but it was saved by the 2D moments. To be honest everything was fine for me, it&#039;s other people I was worried about. Around 35 seconds out of the 1.48 minutes was 2D and I tell you this now, 17:02-17:30 was absolutely BEAUTIFUL. It was one of the best animation moments of the series since it looked professionally animated.<br />
<br />
FIFTH EPISODE:<br />
This episode here is very important. It contains a turning point that changes what we have been seeing for the whole series to something entirely new. We have been witnessing bloodbaths and demon slaying, now a new genre kicks in and brings us to a new interesting arc (3). This episode also had a change of pace. We got a break from the constant killing and can watch the characters enjoy the peaceful time. Another important feature was the 2D. The important scenes had 2D and I got to say that this was crucial. I would of loved it if the whole series was made like that, however this is one of the flaws we have to deal with. 14:46-19:00 was entirely 2D.<br />
<br />
SIXTH EPISODE:<br />
Another episode the studio couldn&#039;t mess up, they showed what we Berserk fans wanted. (6) This whole sentence can&#039;t possibly be put in non-spoiler form. Not big spoiler but things you don&#039;t know of yet. In this episode I realised how much Farenese-sama character has developed. A massive improvement and I consider her cute in 3D and 2D (waifu nearly). I had a laugh at a few scenes in this episode. Guts sword handling was better than earlier this season, I say it was the best of the modern Berserk. 3D didn&#039;t screw up anything for me for the past few weeks if I must say.<br />
<br />
SEVENTH EPISODE: <br />
The action in this episode beats everything so far. It can sometimes look like a PC game in some scenes, but the actual fighting and such is great. Of course it can&#039;t be perfect but I personally think that some of the camera angles didn&#039;t work out.<br />
      <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
SPOILER (OPTIONAL):<br />
(1) In this battle Guts faces Zodd one-on-one. The speed of this battle is crazy to the point that you don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on. The 3D in this didn&#039;t work out that well in my opinion.<br />
(2) A flashback of Farnese-sama&#039;s past. Regarding her past, it was slightly rushed especially around the time when Serpico had the duel and a few other parts. To be honest this isn&#039;t worth mentioning because it&#039;s very minor.<br />
(3) This episode brings the topic of the spirit realm and the talk of Astral beings. Not to mention the newly introduced spirits called Sylphs, air elementals. The sylph sword held by Serpico was brilliant. Also the introduction to Salamanders, fire elementals. Basically the fantasy side of Berserk.<br />
(4) This episode introduces us to the Trolls. It would of been better if their body hair didn&#039;t look like it had gel in it. btw I wasn&#039;t making fun of it, I was simply pointing out it&#039;s flaw. You should know from last season anyway.<br />
(5) In episode 5 during 5:46-6:58, Puck and Evarella fights for an acorn. It&#039;s possible to miss it because it happens during a important conversation.<br />
<br />
(6) Serpico tries out his sylph sword against trolls, he was the best character in this episode. The animation of the magic was brilliant, the colors too. <br />
<br />
(7) So a troll was raping a woman in a 2 second scene and after that, 7 or so Trolls was showed in the background raping with no movement... it was very disappointing.<br />
<br />

STATS (OPTIONAL):<br />
(+)(-) =  is rating increase or decrease from the last edit.<br />
The prequel Berserk (2016) has 46,610 users scored out of 110,842 members. That is a 64,232 users who didn&#039;t score. <br />
Berserk (2017) on the other hand has 7,569 users scored out of 41,702 members. That means that 34,133 members who didn&#039;t score due to several reasons that you probably get an idea of. In the end 69,140 members from Berserk (2016) decided to not add the sequel to their lists. This is assuming that all users added (2016) to their list before (2017).<br />
The prequel has a score of 6.77 and previously had a score of 6.13 when it was airing. Berserk (2017) however has the score of 7.39 (0.04-) and beats its prequels airing score by 1.26 with room for improvement. Anyone can see that there has been a improvement in the scores.<br />
From when I first made this review, there was a big change. <br />
For Berserk (2016), there was a 5,281 increase of users scored and a 4,830 increase of members. <br />
For Berserk (2017), there was a 3,039 increase of users scored and a 6,610 increase of members.<br />
<br />
<br />
I basically said everything I wanted to say, I leave the decision of watching it to you. I spent a lot of time on this review, I hope it helped. Just in case you liked the stats, the recordings are on my profile.<br />

    I&#039;ll keep this short and sweet because everyone here must have seen Berserk (2016). <br />
It&#039;s basically the exact same, except the pacing problems have gotten better. There really isn&#039;t too much too say, the CGI art is trash, but if you have read the manga you&#039;ll take what you can get. Obviously the ending is incomplete because the manga continues on much much further, and is still ongoing. <br />
I&#039;d say don&#039;t watch this if you haven&#039;t read the manga, because it will confuse you and will be the least bit enjoyable. For me I love seeing manga come to life through animation even if it

    I think being an anime-only watcher has helped me in sticking it out with this anime despite its glaring faults in the technical department(CGI,sound effects, etc). <br />
I decided to give the Berserk franchise a chance with the introduction of the 2016 season and if I had to compare that season to 2017&#039;s there are a couple things I can mention. <br />
The story for this season was amazing as always and it is what keeps me coming back to watch week after week. I didn&#039;t have any issues with how the pacing was done.<br />
 I felt like the directing was a bit better this season than

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250788">
        in 2016 although this was mainly for about 75% of the series. The last 1/4 had some major issues that I couldn&#039;t look past. Much of the same can be said for art and animation. The addition of 2D animation for some scenes were more than welcomed on my end but if you are one that do not like the mixture of 2D and 3D in shows then it might be a bit jarring for you.<br />
The soundtrack is what you would&#039;ve been familiar too from the 2016 season and it is great as always. The introduction of new characters as well as the development given to some members of the cast was appreciated. Overall I was able to enjoy this season of Berserk a little bit more than I had the first season.<br />
If you are coming across this anime for the first time, I&#039;d suggest you give episode 1 of the 2016 season a go to see if the 3D CGI would sit well with you. After that I recommend you check out the Berserk anime that came out in the 90s(or the movies if you&#039;re short on time) or you can read the manga for which I keep hearing great things about. I hope my thoughts on this show was useful to you!

    Buckle up, this is going to be a long one.<br />
<br />
Before I get into any detail with this show I&#039;d like to pose a question. What can anime do that manga can&#039;t? What by definition is possible through the medium of animation that is not possible by a series of printed pictures on paper (manga)?<br />
<br />
There&#039;s two things: sound and movement. With anime (read: animation) you can have music, sound effects and often voice acting as well. While movement can be suggested in a manga, the pictures do not literally move before your eyes like with animation. <br />
<br />
My point here is that an animated adaption of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246329">
        manga relies on, well, animation and sound to become something arguably more than the source material. There&#039;s a lot to gain from becoming animated but it&#039;s also possible to screw this up creating a product lesser than the source manga. <br />
<br />
In addition this assumes that adaption did not remove material from the source that affects the quality of the plot. This also assumes that the original artwork hasn&#039;t been degraded in detail and quality. However to make animation economical the art (more often than not) is degraded in quality but I believe the quality of the animation can make up for this. It&#039;s also worth mentioning that the vast majority of manga are primarily in black and white, which opens up the possible avenue of using color where there really wasn&#039;t before.<br />
<br />
The original Berserk is a traditional manga. It is in black and white, features no true animation, and has no sound of any kind. Because of this I am going to be rating this adaptation based on the following: Faithfulness of Plot, Sound Design, Animation Quality and Color Quality. My belief is that any anime adaptation of a manga that fails in these regards is a complete failure of an adaptation.<br />
<br />
Faithfulness of Plot:<br />
<br />
The previous season was absolutely infamous for including an opening episode full of nonsense that contradicted the original plot. I&#039;ve been told spoilers are not allowed so to be brief: Two whole arcs of Berserk were skipped and character introductions were remade to fit in with the much more condensed timeline. This is one of the reasons I gave the previous season a &quot;1&quot;. Over time the episodes became more accurate to the source material but I want to make it clear, this is not a plus. This is not &quot;Plot Quality&quot; but how intact the original source material is. In some very rare occasions changes to a plot in an adaptation might actually make the plot more rational or more enjoyable but it pains me to say this isn&#039;t one of them.<br />
<br />
So when I say something like &quot;This season of Berserk is generally more accurate to the source material&#039;s plot.&quot;, don&#039;t take it as a plus. It is me acknowledging that the original plot still functions. Having an intact plot is not a plus for a medium like animation. It&#039;s not something it gains over the manga. So far the plot has been mostly intact outside of what one might consider nitpicks. The biggest of which is that in episode three I remember the main villain making an incredibly odd manic-villain like face that was totally and completely out of character for a generally well composed villain.<br />
<br />
Sound Design:<br />
<br />
When I say &quot;Sound Design&quot; I first mean sound effects. Now in an average review for some other adaptation I would first jump to music. I would likely not even mention &quot;sound design&quot; because we have reached a point where the average anime has reasonable sound effects to match the actions of the characters and objects on screen. To be honest I can&#039;t really think of a time where this wasn&#039;t the case. But if you&#039;re a Berserk fan you know that this is not the case for this series. <br />
<br />
The *CLANG* sound effect coming from the main character&#039;s weapon makes it sound like a frying pan as compared to a weapon referred to in the source material as &quot;...too thick to be called a sword&quot;. It is not only irrational that such a hollow sound would emanate from this weapon, but the sheer loudness of it is absurd. There&#039;s only three or four different *CLANG* sounds ever used and they are used constantly between this season and the previous. In this season a new character wielding a hammer of immense weight shows up and it turns out that he too uses a mostly hollow, likely aluminum weapon for it also has the *CLANG* sound effect. Also a demon using a &quot;horse head cutter&quot; apparently also needs that same *CLANG*. Watch the first episode and in particular look for the fight between the characters &quot;Guts&quot; and &quot;Zodd&quot; and you&#039;ll understand why I spent so much time talking about one sound effect.<br />
<br />
If you haven&#039;t watched this series than I know you may think this is just a nitpick but every time it occurs I feel a wince of anger that I&#039;m not used to feeling from basic sound effects. I never felt this way watching the original 90&#039;s Berserk adaptation nor the somewhat weaker movie adaptations.<br />
<br />
In general the sound design isn&#039;t the best. For example, amazing composer Susumu Hirasawa composed two songs for this show, &quot;Hai Yo&quot; and &quot;Ash Crow&quot;. On their own these songs are pretty good. I still prefer &quot;Forces&quot; and &quot;Aria&quot;, but these songs are no slouches. But usage is everything in an anime. Hai Yo is used incredibly frequently and is often used as background music. Keep in mind this is not a &quot;background song&quot;. It has lyrics that regularly get talked over.  I like to believe I am writing  in a very dignified style so my emotions may not totally reach you so I want to make it clear that this makes me very unhappy. Very. Susumu Hirasawa&#039;s music made the 90&#039;s anime what it was. The animation quality in that show wasn&#039;t the best (better than this but still not great) but the way his music powered scenes was nothing short of fantastic. He is my favorite anime composer, bar none.<br />
<br />
But here his music is talked over and used as episode preview music. Do you like anime by Satoshi Kon? Do you remember Paranoia Agent? Imagine the OP of that series playing not only at the beginning of every episode but often in the episodes as well at the end too and every time someone was talking over it. And the rest of the soundtrack was replaced with very generic tunes. That&#039;s what the music in this series is like. Same composer by the way, Susumu Hirasawa was there too. One track overused and yet under utilized. <br />
<br />
But the sound design IS better than before. The clangs are a little less prevalent and the voice acting is often easier to hear now. The cast is perfectly acceptable by the way. At no point did I really feel any great or super memorable moments of acting from the cast but that&#039;s more than likely due to the animation quality making the characters look silly over anything else.<br />
<br />
Animation Quality:<br />
<br />
This is the sticker. This is the one you&#039;ve heard about. To put it plainly, this is the fatal flaw. In the past I have been called &quot;shallow&quot; for caring so much about animation quality. But I want to say two things in reaction to that. First I just mentioned I loved the 90&#039;s Berserk anime despite its shortcomings and two, anime IS animation. Anime is by literal definition a Japanese adaptation of the word &quot;animation&quot;. As stated above there are things you can do with this medium that you absolutely 100% cannot do in others. When adapting something like a light novel there&#039;s few pictures to go off of so the animators can probably get away with more than when they are adapting a manga, especially one like Berserk.<br />
<br />
Berserk is written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura and he is well known for his immensely detailed and layered art. That isn&#039;t to say he can&#039;t put a lot of emotion into simpler drawings, he can do both. Anime often runs at a lower frame rate already than (generally speaking) western animation to acclimate for more detail but even among manga Berserk is absurdly detailed. There are images in the Millennium Falcon arc of Berserk (which is what this season is at least partially adapting) in which I simply cannot fathom a human being taking a pencil/pen and drawing line by line those images on paper. <br />
<br />
Because you now know this you might believe it could be impossible to truly and accurately recreate the drawings of Berserk economically in a reasonable time period. And you are right. But that&#039;s fine. This is par for the course for a lot of anime. The creators of this series decided to deal with this problem by using Computer Generated Images. I&#039;ll just say CG for now.<br />
<br />
The CG in Berserk is awful. It runs at an absurdly janky frame rate compounded by highly unnatural movement. In addition to this the creators of the show have decided to add on this fake shading by attempting fake crosshatching on everything. I mean everything. Every single character has these criss-crossing lines on their faces and bodies at all times that make it absurdly clear just how undetailed these models are. This show is mostly CG too. There are hand-drawn scenes but they in some ways might actually make the show worse. Let me explain through comparison.<br />
<br />
In the first two Berserk movies there was a lot of this very problem. Janky CG. But in the third movie many people started to forgive Studio 4C&#039;s CG and I believe this to be for two reasons. The first being that they actually learned from their mistakes. The framerate and detail of their models did increase.<br />
<br />
The second is that, no spoilers, but there was a good amount of supernatural and otherworldly imagery in the third Berserk movie. A lot of that imagery also shows up in this show. The thing is that 2D and 3D imagery inherently clash when the CG isn&#039;t essentially perfect. In more horrific scenes this works out well, providing a somewhat uncanny valley feeling to the proceedings.<br />
<br />
But this new show is ALWAYS like that. Main characters are mostly rendered in CG and then suddenly switching to 2D at random intervals. It&#039;s jarring. I think I&#039;d prefer all mediocre 2D or all substandard 3D over this. Although neither of those alternatives is something I&#039;d want in lieu of actually good animation. And I&#039;m not saying 3D animation is inherently bad, but this is no Gantz if you catch my drift.<br />
<br />
That being said if compared to the previous season this show is better. Guts&#039; model is more accurate, there&#039;s a bit more 2D animation and the general 3D animation is slightly smoother in movement.<br />
<br />
I also want to mention something else this show screws up, camera movements. It seems almost ridiculous to talk about, I never really think about this in any other anime. But the director seems to be either overly excited to have a 3D plane to work in or is simply incompetent with camera movement (or both) so the camera in this series is almost always shaking, or spinning, or doing god knows what to be honest. As the episodes go on and there&#039;s less action and this nonsense definitely happens less but it&#039;s still quite absurd I even have to mention this. This is a failure you just don&#039;t see everyday. <br />
<br />
Color Design:<br />
<br />
The last thing an anime can do over a (black and white) manga is to add color. This show certainly tries to do this. Some colors seem to make logical sense while others are absurdly bright. In general this whole show seems to lack logical shading (see that cross-hatching thing I talked about before) and some characters are crazy bright. There&#039;s an archer character introduced a few episodes in that wears a bright pink shirt, so bright you would be able to see him a mile away, ironic is it not? I made sure to check in the manga and low and behold, in the few colored drawings of him it&#039;s a dark maroon shirt.<br />
<br />
Again this was worse in the previous season (see: Holy Iron Chain Knights) but again this ISN&#039;T a thing I should have to mention. Although Berserk is black and white there IS colored reference material the studio could have easily extrapolated into the show&#039;s character designs.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
This show can be considered functional. You turn on an episode and it will play from beginning to end and will manage to tell a coherent story. It will have sound and movement. It is by all definitions an animated work. But is it worth watching as an adaptation? No. Absolutely not.<br />
<br />
If you didn&#039;t know, as of writing Berserk is the single highest reviewed manga on this website. By a good margin too. It has been showered with tons of praise and I myself have given it a 10 which I want to say is very, VERY rare of me to do. I take &quot;10&#039;s&quot; very seriously. It&#039;s my favorite manga easy but don&#039;t take just my word for it.<br />
<br />
Now consider this show. It&#039;s got what, a 7.37 right now? That&#039;s about 2 points lower than the manga. Is a 7.37 anime better to you than a 9.28 manga? Allow me to make an assumption too: this show would be reviewed even worse than 7.37 if people were actually watching it. The previous season left such a stink in so many mouths that this season is significantly less popular. It&#039;s less popular than Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai, which is an adaptation of a series of plastic models.<br />
<br />
Think about that. An adaptation of the best reviewed manga on this website is less popular than middling softcore porn about a series of purchasable toys. That hurts me.<br />
<br />
I gave this show a &quot;3&quot; meaning I think it is very bad. I love the story of Berserk but this show doesn&#039;t do it justice. There&#039;s so much that can be done with the medium of anime but this show fails to do any of it even though its storyboards were provided to them.<br />
<br />
Please read the manga. Even if you&#039;ve never read a manga before, please give this one a shot. This show doesn&#039;t give the original story what it deserves and fails to add more to it. In the end and after so many words that&#039;s all I can say, please read the manga and do not let the failings of this poor adaptation keep you from enjoying the masterpiece that is Berserk.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Update my score to a 1. All that this show succeeded in, what little there was, completely fell apart in the last 4 episodes. Avoid this show like the plague.<br />

    TL;DR: 7/10 - The dreadful 3D CGI animation is almost bad enough by itself to ruin this whole adaptation, but in the end, this show has enough awesome characters, plot developments, and fight scenes to make it worth watching. <br />
<br />
ART: 2/10<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s get this out of the way. The 3D CGI &quot;art&quot; is bad. There is no way around it, and there is no excuse good enough to make up for it. The actual moments where they take the time to fully draw each scene without the CGI is so beautiful that it literally makes the show worse because you know what it could&#039;ve been, what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250781">
        it should&#039;ve been. I wouldn&#039;t go as far as saying that the show is unwatchable, but I&#039;m admittedly a huge nerd for Berserk, and I&#039;ve conditioned myself by watching RWBY, Blame!, Knights of Sidonia, etc..<br />
<br />
STORY: 10/10<br />
<br />
Spot on adaptation, frame for frame, and scene for scene. So what can I say about the story? It&#039;s Berserk, and it&#039;s the good times, where we really see some actual character development and the fight scenes sprinkled in are frequent and satisfying. There&#039;s new characters, both allies and enemies, magical weapons, mysterious powers, interesting plot developments; I really envy anyone who is unfamiliar with Berserk and gets to see it for the first time in all its glory!<br />
<br />
SOUND: 9/10<br />
<br />
All of the voices are still coming out pretty much how I imagined them when I was reading the manga. 9mm Parabellum Bullet returns to provide the opening once again this season, and it&#039;s just as awesome as the first one; the ending was just okay. Just like the plot, the score of this show often pushes the boundaries of being over-dramatic and cliche, yet somehow it always appears graceful and confident. You may, however, get tired of BLOOD AND GUTS AND GUTS AND BLOOD AND BLOOD AND GUTS AND GUTS AND BLOOD AND BLOOD AND GUTS AND GUTS......and blood<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 10/10<br />
<br />
Solid characters appear this season, and we get to see deeper character development of ones that have been around a while. The unlikely cast that began to form in the first season becomes better, faster, stronger, and most importantly, more fun to watch as they work together to get out of life-threatening situations. Gone are the days of watching Guts, all alone, getting thrown around for twenty minutes before somehow impaling the enemy and dragging his broken body away. Now he has friends to watch him do it too! We also get to see most of the enemies that will become more of a presence as time goes on, even if it&#039;s just for a moment. There are also a few characters, both new and old, whose true alignment is hard to determine.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 7/10<br />
<br />
This one was tough, because I truly enjoyed this season, and this new anime series as a whole. I didn&#039;t want it to end, and I&#039;m excited that a third season has been confirmed. That being said, I can&#039;t blind myself to the complaints of others, who have enjoyed Berserk in the past, but were completely turned off by the new animation. &quot;Read the manga&quot; is not something you want to hear when describing an anime adaptation, and I can&#039;t honestly say that those who are newbies to Berserk would be able to appreciate this show as much as I did. <br />
<br />
OVERALL: 7/10<br />
<br />
It pains me to give an official entry in the Berserk series such a mediocre score, but I feel that if I went any higher it would be the fanboy in me, not the reviewer. This isn&#039;t what anyone imagined when they pictured the day that Berserk would get a continuation to the anime adaptation. I wish they could&#039;ve chosen another show to try this on, but I respect them for trying at least, and it is enjoyable to watch. I hope that they prove everyone wrong next season, and really get the hang of overlaying the CGI with drawings and commit to it like in the movies, but if none of that happens I&#039;ll still watch it.

    As someone who Loves Berserk as a manga and read everything up umtil the most recent stuff. this series just like S1 this series is an insult. it&#039;s an insult at best. the charecter writing is Loyal to it&#039;s original meterial.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is realy nice. It get&#039;s you hyped for some epic events, wich look horrible in this animation. If Studio Madhouse would not be this Busy i wish they would have picked up this show because the art of shingeki, or how it&#039;s animated would have been so much better than the pile of shit the studio produced.

    First time I started watching Berserk in 2014 year and that was movies 1,2,3 and 3D art was amazing + story line and overall 10/10 true masterpiece.<br />
Second time was 2016 season 2 TV series almost everything on 8/10 except art<br />
5/10 everyhing (story) is from manga, but I do not read manga just played berserk in dreamcast and ps2 version.<br />
2017 jul I started season 3 and what I saw art improvements and all other things same, tbh from this 3D art I got resistance and no longer crying about it.<br />
That ANIME in overall = Masterpiece and if you disagree that means you are WEAK!

    I miss the old animation, like the Berserk (1993) version. I wish they continued this series! I can understand why they do not want to due to popularity and all, but it is still annoying leaving it at a cliffhanger or stopping at a certain arc. Of course, we can read the rest in the manga, but I am not a reading fan since that interest went away from doing reading comprehensions for school :D<br />
<br />
Anyway, I gave it a 9/10 for Art because of the CGI. Then again, it is better than nothing.<br />
<br />
The rest were great! I honestly like the story. After watching the old

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369006">
        version, I still watched this, despite it being CGI animation. The story was interesting enough for me to continue the series. It may be bad for others, but it is great in my opinion. Personally, I want all the anime that were cancelled, stopped, left it at a cliffhanger, or stopped at a specific arc, to continue the anime series and finish it like the manga. <br />
<br />
Such as Toriko, Katekyo Hitman Reborn, Slam Dunk, Fist of the North Star, and this, which is Berserk!

    This is hilariously bad. It is so bad that it actually serves a purpose by being a great filter for people with horrible taste. If you ever see someone recommending this to you or someone giving it a score above 4, try not to listen to any recommendations by that person.<br />
<br />
Hilarious webms of the anime:<br />
Zodd transforming: https://webmshare.com/JGWoL<br />
no impact slapping: https://webmshare.com/qN9Mz<br />
Isidro turned into a droid: https://webmshare.com/m8mEJ<br />
asymmetrical movement: https://webmshare.com/3y1aD<br />
South Park or Berserk: https://webmshare.com/WWQLK<br />
<br />
Both the sound and art direction are an absolute mess. <br />
The art is basically only CGI with characters looking and moving like stiff ragdolls, sometimes completely out of sync with their environment or each other,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249215">
        sometimes the animation is so minimal you may think this is actually South Park.<br />
Sound, on the other hand, consists of the same 10 overused effects over and over again. CLANK CLANK CLANK. The sound of a metal pole hitting an empty garbage bin is used for whatever weapons clash.<br />
This is one the level of Musashi Gundou, but sadly it ain&#039;t as hilarious, considering the fanbase waited an eternity for a worthy anime adaptation to continue the saga.

    I don&#039;t know what to say.... Berserk is personally my favorite manga of all the times... The story and the characters, the artwork... Everything is just perfect, i can&#039;t find any flaws.... And fast forward here we are in 2017... The 2016 anime was a letdown but we all still had one hope for the next arc.... The Berserker Armor........ I won&#039;t go into details as to why i absolutely love the story of Berserk as i believe anyone who has read the manga does not require an explanation. So yeah, today the time has finally come, after enduring all these episodes of crappy animation,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review248575">
        bad expressionless cgi, character models that look like manequinns, all of the CLANG sound effects and the memes that came from it..... the fated time was here............ AND IT WAS HORRIBLE!!! I never wrote a review but i was so furiously enraged that i just had to!!!! Where do i begin??? The horrible animations? With the fact that the Berserker Armor episode was probably the worst looking one in the entire series??? I don&#039;t know. I mean, seriously. At the moment where the armor&#039;s helmet changed shapes, they didn&#039;t even bother making a decent scene out of it, i simply assume they had given up and so to minimize the hatred that would come they simply USED A COLORED MANGA PANEL!!!!!! IM SERIOUS!!! A COLORED MANGA PANEL!!!! And thank god they did!!! Because otherwise i probably would have cried!! Thank god they didn&#039;t animate it!!!! Because they are so bad, without talent or skills and disrespectul to the original work that i really hoped the entire series was just colored panels, i would have preffered it. I know you can&#039;t call this a complete review as i only talk about the Berserker Armor episode, but i will say this. The anime is generally terrible, mainly because it&#039;s visuals and the sound effects etc doesn&#039;t do it justice either. I really wish that show was given the amount of love and artistry it deserved... It&#039;s really sad. That one episode was the thing that made me break.... I will not watch another episode, simply because of the pure dissapointment... I will just re-read the manga to wash the shittyness off, if it is possible at all.... I honestly have to say that LIDENFILMS have sinned here.... If i could give a negative score then i would have given it a -10<br />
Truly Berserk is one of my favorite stories and LIDENFILMS have created such an abomination that i have given it the lowest score... It is a sad day for Berserk

    STOP. Please, just stop.<br />
<br />
This is a disaster, this is a trainwreck, this is trash to the ten billionth degree. Who in the hell thought that it was a good idea to give one of the greatest manga franchises of all time to a terrible, inexperienced CG Studio who couldn&#039;t animate their way out of Mickey Mouse&#039;s toilet bowl? Stop, just stop already, this is tearing me apart, Lisa! Give Berserk to Trigger, give Berserk to Madhouse, give Berserk to ANYONE EVEN MODERATELY COMPETENT IN THE ART OF ANIMATION IN THE SLIGHTEST BIT AT ALL! <br />
<br />
Why? Why does this exist? Everyone involved in the decision to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271560">
        give Berserk to this studio should be fired into the sun. If I was Miura I would be having a freaking conniption that this was what they were doing to an absolute masterpiece of a manga. The 1997 anime is a bit dated, sure, but it still looks competent, it&#039;s easily watchable, it conveys the tone, the fight choreography make this thing look like toddlers slap boxing with flimsy action figures in a play pin. Why was this CG, why was this given to this studio, just why?<br />
<br />
Please, end it, reboot immediately with a better studio, make it stop, this is literally painful to watch. 1 out of 10, I&#039;d give it a negative 10,000 out of 10 if I could. Stop this madness, give one of the greatest mangas of all time to a great animation studio, this will be remembered as one of the worst studio decisions in the history of the anime industry. JUST STOP, please and thank you.

    I can&#039;t believe i&#039;ve rated a Berserk so low but well..I did and here comes one of the shortest reviews i&#039;ve done to date.If you are a fanboy or a fangirl or someone who can&#039;t handle mature language get a hike cause things are gonna get a bit messy.<br />
It&#039;s a little known fact among my peers that i love Berserk.In fact i love it so much that i wanted to move to Japan and marry it,have it&#039;s kids and live happily ever after.But i think it might have been a holiday romance and when we came back i realised that it had horrid face hair.<br />
I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264620">
        was in love with the manga.All the details,the story,the design....Every single damn thing was absolutely stunning..And some time back the first one popped and boy did all the boys howl like we saw Pamela Anderson blowing Tommy Lee on a boat(which happened some years later actually).And while not the best even by the standards of the time it had something to it that made you....Happy.<br />
Fast forward to 2016 and after many attempts the franchise had yet to see a proper adaptation.And this one was the first ever Berserk that made me hate its&#039; guts(pun intended).In short it was unwatchable.My head was spinning like i took cocaine or meth.Which clearly to my mind was what the studio that made this was on at the time.That horrible CGI,i still have nightmares about it.<br />
2017 and there&#039;s word about this,the new and better in every way Berseker..And when i saw it i smiled.I smiled like Joker did.But my friends as it turned out the only normal thing,animationwise wwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaassssss..The fucking opening.After that it was like being dipped in liquid nitrogen and then smashed to pieces.<br />
All the excitement and joy gone in secs.i couldn&#039;t believe my eyes.The CGI was still there and still as cancerous as ever.If the previous one gave my eyes cancer this gave my brain Ebola and i died painfully screaming like a madman.<br />
The characters design....Dear lord deliver us from evil.The shades for example were like i took a pencil and just drew some lines on their faces.You remember those early 32 bit console graphics?Well they managed to do worse than those.It was painful to watch.The camera angles are like they&#039;re taken out of Ozzy&#039;s birthday party after he got hold of a camera,stoned out of his mind.<br />
The animation is the killer of this show.Even the 90&#039;s Berserk animation is better than that.Now i know that the cost of adapting the highly detailed manga would be off the charts.But this isn&#039;t an excuse for such a bad job.The frame rate is jerky at best.The movements are so unnatural it&#039;s like watching a mouse breastfeeding an elephant.The combined use of 2d and 3d is off the place.The end result is so appaling it&#039;s almost like watching Donald Trump havin one of his famous showers...<br />
Then onto the sound dept..The sound effects are horrible beyond belief..A fight breaks out and swords clash and you hear the unmistakable sound of your mother banging sauce pans..If i wanted to hear sauce pans banging i&#039;d hear Metallica&#039;s St.Anger lads...The opening song?It doesn&#039;t serve only as an opening song but also as a background music...Seriously?How freakin lazy are they?You can hear the damn lyrics in the background while conversations are taking place.<br />
I expect the fanboys to barge in and burn me alive for this review,but i&#039;m not into fanboyisms..If something is crap i&#039;ll say it&#039;s crap..Emotions don&#039;t make for a better show..And this isn&#039;t one.<br />
IF we were talking about the manga,IF,i would be writing a love letter to the maker not a rant in MAL.But now we are talking about the anime.And since the most basic pillar,the animation,is outrageously bad to the point it becomes dangerous for my health then i can&#039;t possibly care if the story is made from the tears of an angel.And since i can&#039;t bring my self to watch this i can&#039;t and won&#039;t care about anything.If they wanted me and other people to care maybe they should have gone down another path.Which they didn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Let me give you an example.If you have a surgery you expect the doctor to do a good job and not leave you a hideous scar.If the doctor does a good job all is well.If he leaves a sponge or a screwdriver inside you after the operation...See my point?<br />

    Kentaro Miura did a great job giving us such a series to read. If it wasn&#039;t for his many hiatus, Berserk would have been competing with One Piece in manga category. Now coming to the anime, again going for the 3DCGI. The animation totally sucked, it was looking like playing a 3rd rate 3D video game. The only thing that helped berserk cross the line of being a decent anime was its intense storyline and an amazing plot. Although, the anime left out a lot of scenes, but if they would have stuck to 2DCGI rather than doing the entire stuff it would have much

        great!!! The fight scenes and the blood shed would have been more intensified if the frame overlaying would have been a lot smoother considering they would have done it in 2D style animation. Aside from that it was all Kentaro Miura&#039;s story telling and plot that dragged the anime forward keeping viewers glued to the series cosnidering many Berserk fans prefer reading it rather than watching after the Berserk (1997) series.

    This is my first review.. ok sooo..<br />
It&#039;s a great story, with great characters, but had a lot of troubles with their adaptation..<br />
I&#039;d admit that I have a preconcept of the show, and of course I did&#039;nt live under a Rock, I know everything about the hate that this work had, principaly on the CGI animation, and will not say it was good, at all.. So I think is not as bad as peaple say.. <br />
The point here is, The producers, directors, animators had a really bad choice at the time to decide the artstyle, and of course, they don&#039;t have the money, to do that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review364597">
        CGI works properly.. I don&#039;t accept CGI on Anime, but some of shows that I&#039;like a lote was made on CGI, this has&#039;nt the best that I have seen but has&#039;nt the worse either, I think they made it decent, must of the time, and have their good moments, and the bad moments, at this point I&#039;ll have to say, the episode 9 was awfull, there&#039;s no excuse, but then episode 10 was really good, but people  chose the bad one to shot, but, for me is very unfair to say that all the show was disastrous only for one capther. In a second point, is very confusing why they decide some stupid thing like made the apostols and monsters talk, I mean, you can paint the main art of those characters and put the static image, you can have better results if you do that with a little camera movement than a horrible 3D model with horrible plastic textures, some of the forest escenes was a large purple planes with clonned 3D trees that looks worse than PS1 models, why? those are some of the stupids things that don&#039;t have sense for me.. <br />
Ok let&#039;s get over that, I can&#039;t tell you if it&#039;s a good adaptation because I haven&#039;t read Kentaro Miura&#039;s manga, what I can say based on the art that I do know about the author, is that it leaves a lot to be desired, on this last point , it made me realize how good the first adaptation of 1997 was, it&#039;s sad after seeing that, and with the emotion that lets want to see the continuation of that heartbreaking story, that many of the moments that should have been nostalgic or cruel, look like a bad parody because of bad art. However, the story written by Mr. Kentaro Miura is too good on its own for you to get carried away and immerse yourself and enjoy it, the Characters great too, principally our Black Knight, and the secundary ones that we can see how their goes evolving during their adventure.

    I don&#039;t now how people can defend this anime,the story of berserk shines through. while it has some of the worst cgi i&#039;ve ever seen and then when it does the 2D it looks good but thats hardly ever. The VA is good. The music is good at first but after they replay the same music over , over  and over , it gets old very quite. The characters are great when they don&#039;t rewrite them from the manga. i didn&#039;t really have much enjoyment due to awful cgi. The manga is a downright masterpiece and does not deserve to have this crap as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250510">
        an adaption. if you like the story and haven&#039;t read the manga do yourself a favour and read it.don&#039;t waste your time with this anime.

    I don&#039;t know how this got a rating this high, i mean 7.14 or sth. like that i just can&#039;t. you know guys this is a disgrace to you and the masterpiece of miura himself you should not be satisfied with this horseshite and don&#039;t be afraid to ask for sth. better we, the manga and miura deserve better than this shit this is just a shame. instead go read the manga or watch the anime from 1997 also not perfect but way better than this. well i need to mention im happy that susumu did the music at least he does a great job

          <span style="display: none;" id="review260705">
        and did it also in the 1997 anime thats one of the few positive things i have to say about this steaming pile of disgraceful shit. yea i like to use disgraceful because this shit is just an disgrace, you know when u order some of your favorite food and you get shit served and they want to tell you this is the food you ordered or wanted after you said this is not what i wanted well you got the same here just because there is not much of animated berserk doesn&#039;t mean you have to accept it all as good or say: well at least sth. no thats not how it should be, it is an horrible adaptation and nothing else and thats what it has to be pointed out for

    A crime to any review is to not start with what you&#039;re reviewing in the review. But a series as &quot;lauded&quot; as this one requires a short preamble.<br />
<br />
After watching the original 97 series, I was left in a flurry. I *really* wanted to watch more, but I had heard so much flame about the newer series. I really didn&#039;t want to approach it. I saw the gifs. You know the gifs. But alas, my thirst to see what happened next needed to be quenched, so I bit the bullet. I figured the first movie would be fine to watch, since if it was in fact

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341120">
        terrible, at least it was short. I was expecting the worst at this point.<br />
<br />
But it really turned my head around. Sure, the CGI was a jarring at first, but after acclimating to it, I really fell into the story being told. Even if it was a retelling of the 97 series, it was nice to see that part of the story again. And by the time I finished the 3rd movie, we were treading new ground, and I was all the way in to wherever Guts was going next. Which lead to me watching the 2016 series, which picked up where the movies left off. I thought the CG in the movies took adjusting, but looking back they were actually done pretty well. I missed the movies&#039; CG two minutes in. Moving to a different production company really does wonders, essentially starting from a clean slate, and not for the best. But the story was as strong as ever. So I trod on to the 2nd cour.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
Continuing on the dark tale of Berserk, it pulls that off pretty well. Not much to say, if you&#039;re in this far in the ongoing story of Guts&#039; epic, let it be known that the story continues at a fine pace.<br />
<br />
Art: 3<br />
The CGI in the reboot series has definitely left an impression on a lot of fans. It varies from passable to to Photoshop dragging across the screen. When the show isn&#039;t using CG, it looks decent for the most part. It&#039;s hard to capture what makes the manga look good at times, some characters and monsters are a combination of Eldritch horror and HR Giger&#039;s wet dreams. Unless you&#039;re working for a Studio Bones-level company, you&#039;re probably not gonna have the budget to pull that off. But there are times when they use stills to capture important moments, as if they had no idea how to animate something at all.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
The mood presented in the OST is consistent as ever at least. But the sound design is nothing too great, and some specific sounds just don&#039;t line up, and are very noticeable. Not everything Guts hits with his sword is made of metal or rock, it shouldn&#039;t sound like that. I watched the subtitled version of the show, so I can&#039;t speak for the dub. But I did try the dub of the previous cour and moved onto the subtitled version after one episode. It may or may not be the same quality in the 2nd cour.<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
I just want Guts to find what brings him peace. This is where Berserk succeeds for me.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
Despite the show not looking the greatest pretty often, the show was still very easy to watch. Berserk is known for its great story, and having any more of it put out in anime form is appreciated here. Seeing where this crazy tale goes next will always keep me watching.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
I think the new series of Berserk gets trashed way more than it deserves. Yeah, the animation is laughably bad at times, and it&#039;s a shame. A show you want to take so seriously can fail to the point of laughter, constantly breaking immersion. I&#039;m not trying to deny or downplay that. What I&#039;m trying to get at is that if you can get over/accept that the animation is poor, what you have is a further continuation to a legendary epic. One of the most important manga to come out of the 90&#039;s, pushing the limit of what was being made then, and even to this day. So I hope you don&#039;t pass on this show just because the production company couldn&#039;t afford to make it look the best, you&#039;d really be missing out.

    Berserk 2017, don&#039;t judge a book by its cover. I&#039;ve tried so, but the product evokes as well the popular adage &quot;don&#039;t make the same mistake twice!&quot;.<br />
<br />
In case of story and characters the applause for writing a gorgeous Manga, with good story and character development rightfully belongs to the Manga-ka and no one else. In other words, the appropriate use of an already given story and its characters is a solid ground-skill that is required for the preparation or completion of an respectable result. That basic knowledge can, neither be regarded as valid sign of professionalism nor as a possibility to mitigate flaws in other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272247">
        disciplines, e.g. the visual adapting. In brief, if the good story and its character are regarded as a merit of the creative team, to me that seems like an intention to trigger a cycle which reverse the previous link between cause and effect. In combination with an attitude of &quot;Everything is good as long as it is entertaining&quot;, this leads to an unacceptable philosophy that is best described as an unreflected, illogical positivist perception.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t matter how much effort and fine polish was used to improve the visuals of Berserk 2017 if techniques are used in the same way as in Berserk 2016 the result will be the same visual disgrace, just like a leopard cannot change its spots. Instead of using the standard 2D, GEMBA chosen a 3D modeling which cuts to 2D in dint of close-up shots. But the 3D modeling looks sloppy because well portrayed expressions or emotions are often lacking. The synchronization quality between speeches and mouth movement is bad. And last but not least, to put insult to injury, the most compelling, expressiveness and vivaciousness force in the case of an anime character that creates a tension in the observer somewhere between interest and seductive sensibility is the expression of the eyes but the performance attempts in Berserk 2017 are still remotely inadequate to printout the strength and beauty of this elementary component. For this reason and because of the stiff unnatural movement of the characters the created actions scenes do leave the spectator&#039;s souls untouched. The shadows are still done by linear hatching, it looks cheap and, at the same time irritates, because frequently it looks like the shadows are floating and even moving when the camera zoom-in or -out. The cinematography, is still sometimes incorrect so that the viewer frequently feels uncomfortable, by the disorienting camera work. All in all it looks artificial, totally unpleasant and even sometimes extremely ugly, like the outward appearance (esp. the face) of the pirate-captain near the end of episode 12. An creative team must be prepared to listen to complaints and accept criticism. Notwithstanding the fact that the predecessor was already criticized a lot, all the flaws of the 2016 version are represent in Berserk 2017 as well. In this connection, the saddest aspect is - could laugh about it if the matter were not so serious - that there are signs of what it could have been but they did not put any effort on and ignored the feedback, so that it feelt like wasting the breath with the words.<br />
<br />
The sound section was not much better either. Quite the contrary, the sound of sword is still ridiculous and synthetic no matter what it hits. The BGM seemed frequently misplaced and even disturbing. I constantly had the feeling that the music reminded me of other famous Themes. &quot;Peering into Darkness&quot; e.g. reminds me of Maurice Ravel`s &quot;Bolero&quot;. The OP &quot;Sacrifice&quot; - 9mm Parabellum Bullet, isn`t bad but it sounds more like an opening for an shounen, rather than a dark and gloomy medieval fantasy show. A suitable musical form that allow the right atmosphere to be created for a show like this, needs to be more gloomy (IMO). For example good gothic-rock or power metal could have been appropriate. The ED &quot;Issai wa Monogatari&quot; by Nanjou, Yoshino (feat.) Yanagi, Nagi, maybe the text is poetically interesting but starts off with monotonous singing then starts developing somewhat style but soon refocusing on typical, appropriate for an ending theme instead of inventing something new and therefore it is not very notable. In the predecessor, the voice acting seemed to be the one thing that at least showed some effort but this time it does not feel the same.<br />
<br />
Well, there has been a small probability to convince me but then I encountered the problem that they have done &quot;the same mistakes twice!&quot;. That was a very disappointing development in my view and so I really hope that there will be no continuation of using the Manga as a sacrificial lamb on the altar of commerce. As bad as the predecessor but this approach, also has additionally the downside of being the second failure.<br />
<br />
It simply was no fun at all.<br />
<br />

    This show showed me how anime can ruin a great manga. This show fails on all accounts for me. The awful CG which looks like it took 4 minutes to program, the shot composition which a baby would do better, pathetic fps in fight scenes and character designs which look like nightmare fan art of the original. I&#039;d rather have my intestines ripped out and fed to me than being subjected to watching a second longer of this terrible, terrible adaptation that puts Akame ga Kill on a pedestal when compared to it. Excuse me while I go scoop out my brain&#039;s memory center so
