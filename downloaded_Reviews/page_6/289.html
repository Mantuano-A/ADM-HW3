        1969. Tezuka Productions and MAPPA have collaborated to reboot the franchise with this new darker series; it is violent, gory, and it contains mature content. The premise goes as follows… In Sengoku-era Japan, a baby is born without skin, limbs, or internal organs, but the catch is his father sold all his body parts to demons and in return, they granted him power. And the dad of the year award goes to...! Not him. The demons who were given his body parts live throughout Japan, free to wreak havoc as they please. The deformed baby was set adrift on a river by order of his empathetic mother, and somehow he survived with the help of prosthetics. Later, this baby grows up to be a ronin, Hyakkimaru. It is his goal to retrieve what the demons stole from him by killing them all. At the start of his journey, he encounters the titular character Dororo; he&#039;s a mischievous kid with a name that means exactly what he is, a thief. Together they traverse Japan to kill demons and get back Hyakkimaru’s body parts. This is a fantastic plot setup loaded with potential. Imaging the possible routes the story could take inspired so much excitement in me, but unfortunately Dororo squandered its potential and went out with a whimper rather than a roar. <br />
<br />
Throughout the vast majority of this overlong 24-episode series, the plot structure is mostly episodic. I expected Dororo to be an epic complete story of Hyakkimaru’s fight to get back what was stolen, in the end, it didn’t live up to its great premise. In the beginning, it was exciting, Hyakkimaru is a blind and deaf ronin with his limbs replaced by swords. He is determined to fight in spite of his defects, so finds a way. We don’t see the training right away, which makes him an enigmatic anti-hero. Right away, the show settles into an episodic structure, at first, the battles are thrilling; Hyakkimaru slices and dices through giant horrifying monsters with blood and gore flying everywhere. The fight choreography is incredible at first; visceral audio-visual feedback with each slash and stab makes combat tense and realistic, but as the show progresses it becomes far less impactful. Choreography weakens to just a simple slice drawn 2D across a monster design, smash cut to the next shot, and boom the demon is dead. By this early point in the show, it already feels like it is lifelessly going through the motions of the plot like a chore. Each monster used to be so incredibly important, he got back an organ or sometimes even a whole ass limb and it felt as banal as if Hyakkimaru was picking up lunch at a fast-food drive-through. No impact, just progression to the next scene leaving you feeling unsatisfied. It becomes a chore to watch, you just want him to kill the demon, get his body part, then move on to something more interesting. <br />
<br />
There are some episodes here and there with good self-contained stories, like Dororo’s bloodstained backstory or Hyakkimaru’s training. These unexpectedly exciting episodes showcased the best art. The visuals CAN be solid, not spectacular, but well stylized and consistent. The gray-scaled flashbacks were somewhat obnoxious with red unnecessarily highlighted. There are less blatant ways of indicating a scene takes place in the past, just gray-scaling it is lazy. It’s like visual storytelling for babies, give me something worth analyzing. If only these episodes didn’t feel haphazardly thrown into the season, they would have been highpoints rather than slightly less average than the rest. Like any episodic plot structure, things somewhat go back to normal at the end of each episode, with the added limb onto the main character. Many episodes don’t feel connected to each other, which lessens the impact of the previous one. After binge-watching it I can say it is very disjointed, which might not seem obvious watching it weekly. It doesn’t flow naturally as a story should, we get a new monster each episode (with the occasional two-parter) and a development episode tossed into the mix at random. Dororo gets a flashback in late in the first cour, and it’s touching if predictable, but it feels forced. He randomly gets a fever at the start of the episode, then suddenly he’s telling us his life story in a fevered haze. This show is made for TV airing, to spark hype each week then be forgotten until it does something different in the next chapter. I don’t want to generalize here, but it seems like most anime produced by MAPPA have varying degrees of pacing issues and art inconsistencies. Dororo is no exception. <br />
<br />
For the most part, the art is decent. Excessive zooming in and out on still images is constantly used in place of animation. The worst instance of this is a giant explosion being zoomed in and out on as an animator dragged it around their screen with a cursor. This happens during the most climactic moment in the entire show! These cost-cutting animation techniques undermine the impact of any scene they are in. The character art is cell-shaded, which is typically fine, but here it looks quite lazy. In other terms, the animation is very low effort. Cell shading isn’t a problem on its own but it doesn’t look right on the watercolor background art. I hesitate to call the background art “detailed” because it always looks are so messily drawn. Watching the characters walk across pudgy watercolor backgrounds looks off. It’s as if they were stickers pasted onto the screen rather than a part of the show. This further contributes to characters not being fully fleshed out into real and relatable people. For most of the show, the main perspective is given to Dororo instead. Once Hyakkimaru grows a personality he shares the protagonist role, then eventually his perspective overshadows Dororo—and mind you he has about one personality trait for much of the show. Dororo is developed enough to maintain interest in the first half of the show; he was orphaned at a young age and losing his beloved mother visibly impacted him. By the time Hyakkimaru takes the role as the main character, Dororo is sidelined and he becomes a damsel in distress to be saved in many of the side plots. When the show ends, it feels like he barely mattered to the story at all, other than giving us some emotional investment while Hyakkimaru was an aimless killing machine. <br />
<br />
This is the fundamental issue with the two main characters, there isn&#039;t much to them. When one of them is developed, the other is unimportant. Dororo follows Hyakkimaru into fights out of habit and belonging, as we learn from his lonely back story. Hyakkimaru is silent because he cannot speak without his organs—which feels more like a plot convenience to avoid writing a character—but once he can speak he needs to learn how. His speech is simplistic, one word at first, sometimes his handicap is played to comedic effect; this is especially annoying in one tonally maligned comedy filler episode. There needed to be gradual character development along the way. But instead, it is episodic, things go back to the way they were. Hyakkimaru is already a capable fighter at the start of the show, and his determination to fight despite his lack of limbs made for exciting fights. As he gains more limbs the show loses what made it so original, it gradually becomes a cliched samurai story. Hyakkimaru’s struggle to fight even with defects becomes less of a struggle, he becomes a typical blank slate badass protagonist. Midway through the second cour is a major tonal whiplash. Rather than a continuation of the intense emotional action, the writers opt for an over the top comedic filler episode. It is a mediocre episode in its own right, with no action whatsoever with a lame monster of the week. What really gets me is how badly the episode was placed in the series. In truth, it doesn’t fit anywhere in a show that takes itself this seriously. Many of the episodes could have been removed entirely to reach the final confrontation faster. Once we do get to the ending it is worthwhile, but by then the damage has been done. Hyakkimaru&#039;s characteristic development leaps by the final arc to justify the duality between him and the antagonist. It works at setting up a decent finale that ultimately felt like an undeserved finale. <br />
<br />
Throughout Dororo&#039;s twenty-four episodes, one thought was almost always on my mind, &quot;This would be great if...&quot; <br />
If it was shortened to twelve episodes, then the writing would be condensed with more time to develop the side characters. <br />
If they removed the filler and focused more on developing Hyakkimaru. <br />
If they gave Dororo more purpose in the show. <br />
If they connected all the random one-off stories with a theme. <br />
If it were shorter, then maybe the art quality would have been more consistent. <br />
<br />
In the end, I can&#039;t say I disliked watching all of Dororo. There were parts I liked, parts I hated, and the rest of the show was average. The most enjoyment I got from this anime was imagining how great it could have been. It is not worth anger, analysis, or remembering, and consequently, I have no reason to watch it ever again.

    Older classics from the history books getting back to modern times seems to be one of MAPPA’s hobbies in recent years. We’ve had Ushio to Tora from Summer 2015 and more recently Banana Fish from Summer 2018. Dororo’s remake under MAPPA’s umbrella made an outstanding impression and gives more reasons to bring old classics back. What a time to be alive in this timeline.<br />
<br />
The original series aired some 50 years ago in the late 1960s. Most of us probably weren’t alive back then to see this older timer. Manga with content revolving around demons seemed like a popular trend among children those days. The brainchild

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311183">
        behind this work is Osamu Tezuka, who is regarded as a “the father of manga”. With famous franchises like Black Jack and Astro Boy, he goes down in history is a legendary figure. <br />
<br />
Dororo is a dark fantasy adventurous tale with supernatural elements and dealing with characters’ emotional journey of discovery. From its very few episodes, I noticed an old school feeling that blends with modern quality productions. The original series had a much simpler animation style with cartoony character designs and black and white quality. MAPPA and Tezuka Productions decided to take their style to bring these characters to modern standards. Immediately, I felt as if the show had a credible outline for its artwork. Consisting of 24 episodes, the roadmap of the show also gives an easy pacing for new viewers. Do note that I have not read the manga but jumping into this anime isn’t much of a problem. We have two main characters – Hyakkimaru and Dororo traveling together during the Sengoku period. Hyakkimaru is the limbless ronin due to circumstances of his birth while Dororo is the thief who joins as his partner during their journey. The two forges a unique bond despite their contrasting differences. And throughout their journey, they face many obstacles ranging from powerful demons, saving people, and overcoming their own personal struggles.<br />
<br />
At the heart of the show, Dororo is known for its moody and dark tones. There’s the theme of revenge born from the beginning. The episodic structure (as some fans dubs it as ‘monster of the week’) is a typical style of storytelling for this show. However, Dororo’s intriguing content comes from character development. This is especially true for Hyakkimaru as he begins to develop human characteristics, feelings, and becoming more of himself. Being accompanied by Dororo, they begin to understand each more and more with each progressing episode. At some point, we even see Hyakkimaru laughing, which is something he’d probably never expected from himself. Dororo is also a character that injects a dose of playful energy into the show. Let’s face it, Dororo is a kid but sometimes shows the mature personality of an adult. As a show about survival in a dark and grim world, the duo relies on each other every step of the way. In the latter half of the show, Hyakkimaru’s mentality contains both of a human and demon. His desire to protect Dororo may also be his greatest weakness as he is forced to rely on his demonic side. It makes the overall show very thrilling as viewers will anticipate the consequences of his actions.<br />
<br />
In Dororo, notice how almost every character our duo encounter faces some sort of challenge in their lives. Whether it’s about personal relationships or just to survive, this anime makes it clear that it’s not an easy world to be in. There’s carnage with gory content as the show establishes itself as a dark fantasy. The monsters are characterized with a fusion between classic and modern designs while taking ideas from folklore. There’s also a question to be addressed – what really makes a monster? Is human another word for monster? There’s a sense of grey morality explored in later episodes that will no doubt be controversial. This includes the actions of Kagemitsu Daigo and Tahomaru. For their motives and actions that greatly influenced the show’s plot, they can be viewed as monsters. In other words, if we behave like beasts, we are no better than the beasts themselves. <br />
<br />
Nonetheless, I don’t see Dororo as a complicated storyteller. The episodic nature and dark fantasy elements brings together a classic adventure. It holds itself together as a visual masterpiece with its aesthetics. Particularly, I find some episodes with the black and white coloring to fit perfectly. What also amazes me is how Dororo doesn’t make battles feel pointless. There’s action to follow, behaviors to observe, and see how each fight progresses change for characters. Hell, such a show with all this despair even has its happy moments. The show’s humor comes off naturally thanks to Dororo’s personality. It doesn’t play out forcefully with questionable dialogues and character interactions. Instead, the character chemistry between our two main leads is what does the talking. The more you watch this anime, the more you’ll feel attached to our duo. It’s not a question of how but the way they develop together in their journey.<br />
<br />
For being an iconic classic, Dororo’s modern adaptation will easily get people into the mood for those who has a taste for dark fantasy. Even if you don’t belong in that category, that’s alright because it’s a chance to experience the artistic creativity of Osamu Tezuka. And I’m so glad to be alive in this timeline to experience it.

    Dororo is an anime about a child that was born with a terrible curse and his journey to defeat the demons that cursed him. It&#039;s a great mix between realism and old japanese folktale, and a great mix between action, drama, and mystery.<br />
<br />
Everything this anime does is shockingly well. The animation is smooth, Great sword-fighting actions scenes, and some philosophizing about living a life of violence versus peace make this series cover the gamut of emotions a viewer wants from any series, not just anime. The world is immersive and deep, and while the main character himself can&#039;t speak a word it&#039;s incredible how much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301430">
        you&#039;re able to feel for him and everything he&#039;s going through. There&#039;s a constant sense of mystery in the air that keeps every episode fresh and with good pacing, and the demons themselves are very creative and make for great fights. Always makes you crave for the next episode and this is something that I really want in any show.<br />
<br />
Overall, a pretty damn amazing anime that&#039;s a breath of fresh air from your run of the mill action anime thanks to avoiding every cliche that&#039;s plagued the last two decades, which is ironic considering the source material was made half a century ago.<br />
                               A must watch for all anime fans

    In this day and age we have been presented with remakes of classic anime from various decades.<br />
From Magical Circle Guruguru, Fruits Basket, Legend of the Galactic Heroes and Bogglepop Phantom. With the few exceptions that shall not be named theses remakes have been well received by fans and critics. This leads me to on of the more recent anime remakes Dororo.<br />
<br />
Unlike any other remake minus Fruits Basket 2019 I had high expectations as this being done one of my favourite directors Kazuhiro Furuhashi the same director that gave us the underrated cop drama Your Under Arrest, the flawed but highly enjoyable Rurouni Kenshin adaptations and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311187">
        atmospheric Hunter x Hunter 1999. Fortunately the series managed to almost perfectly deliver my high expectations as this is easily one of the best anime remake I have seen period.<br />
<br />
The story follows a ronin named Hyakkimaru who is born malformed and is required to kill demons to obtain his missing body parts. He is accompanied by a troublesome orphan thief called Dororo during his travel. From there the duo roamed around various countries, hunting for ghouls and demons.<br />
<br />
There a lot of things to like about Dororo. For starters this show is very dark both visually and narratively.<br />
It&#039;s Sengoku-era of Japan after all. The most darkest period for Japan. The dark nature of Dororo is only enchanted with the show asking us the viewer various deep questions what makes us human and what defines a machine and what makes a monster. Hyakkimaru character arc is a brilliant case study of this. From the first episode he has a personality of a machine where he hunts down demons without breaking a sweat.<br />
<br />
As he gains more body parts he starts to becomes more human where he starts to understand the world that he is in but at the same time Hyakkimaru&#039;s journey of collecting body part&#039;s is slowly breaking him mentally.<br />
<br />
Not only the harsh reality of the world starts to mentally creep him he also has to face the fact that he has killed various people along he&#039;s journey hunt and as a result it makes Hyakkimaru less of an actual human. This is Dororo biggest strengths by a long shot as it makes you the viewer think about all the actions that Hyakkimaru has done thought he&#039;s body part journey.<br />
<br />
This is the main reason why it was hard for me to call Dororo a full out episodic series.<br />
Similar to Cowboy Bebop and to a less extant Ouran High School Host Club the series has all the elements of a standard episodic series yet the characters are developing along with the plot.<br />
When the series starts taking the overarching plot approach towards the end it&#039;s feels natural thanks to the series strong direction and build up. It didn&#039;t pull it&#039;s overarching plot from its ass as every single episode of Dororo had a purpose despite it being mostly episodic.<br />
The second best thing about Dororo is how brilliant the world-building is. The series is set in Sengoku-era of one of the most darkest periods for japan yet it does a splendid job of making the world of Dororo feels alive thanks to the spectacular attention to detail towards various locations and races.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Dororo does have some minor faults.<br />
To say that at times Dororo doesn&#039;t have enough substance at times is an understatement. Granted that compared to any other MAPPA series excluding Banana Fish. Dororo has the most substance thanks to it&#039;s setting, characters writing and thematic exploration but at same time Dororo clearly had its fair share style over substance moments where the writing was put in a bus in favour of visual presentation at times.<br />
<br />
This also leads to my second and final problem with Dororo the inconsistent quality of the episodic episodes. Granted there was not an episode in Dororo that I consider to be bad or even average but I still felt like some episodes had clearly better written than others.<br />
The weakest episodes of Dororo went for the more typical approach by featuring less memorable one off characters and stories.<br />
Regardless theses two flaws did not shut down the adventurous party that was Dororo.<br />
<br />
A silent protagonist in any fictional work is very hard to pull off as can easily becomes blank stake for that particular work.<br />
Fortunately Hyakkimaru doesn&#039;t fall into the same traps of other silent protagonists he is an interesting character from start to finish. His character arc was well-handled thanks to great writing, and he&#039;s just a sympathetic character overall despite him being mostly silent.<br />
<br />
Similar to a silent protagonist a child protagonist in any fictional work is very hard because they can easily be the most annoying thing in your story. Fortunately the character Dororo doesn&#039;t fall into the same traps as most other child protagonists as he&#039;s a great and enjoyable character.<br />
She&#039;s the perfect companion for Hyakkimaru as she tries to best to help Hyakkimaru succeeds of his journey of getting his body parts back. Her personality is full of life and humanity despite being a child living in a harsh world.<br />
<br />
The best part about these two protagonist is their strong character chemistry with each other. I really loved the dynamic duo of Dororo and Hyakkimaru as they have a strong and unbreakable bond. Both Dororo and Hyakkimaru would do anything to ensure that their partner is safe from danger.<br />
<br />
The rest of the characters were good. Some of them are better than others, but they all served they roles and purpose in the story.<br />
If, I had two words to describe the visuals of Dororo it would be atmospheric and gorgeous.<br />
<br />
MAPPA did a fantastic job of bring this classic series to life with its beautiful soft colour palette, well-drawn characters designs and splendid background secretly that is filled with attention to detail. This is only enchanted with the fantastic visual direction. When the show decides to have a flashback the entire show minus the blood goes to black and white which homages the visual presentation of the original series.<br />
The animation was for the most part is beautifully choreographed and well-animated. It does dip at times notably episode 14-15 but it never dipped to a point of being ugly.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is outstanding. The series uses a mixture of Melancholic and Japanese folk music pieces only enhances the plot and setting.<br />
The same thing can be said for all the opening and ending themes that Dororo has to offer.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is strange in a good way. <br />
The Seiyuus that did the voices for Dororo and especially Hyakkimaru were newcomers. With this in mind you would think that the voice acting would be bad because of this but no. In fact, they were amazing as they fitted with they respective roles perfectly.<br />
My favourite Seiyuu out of the two is Rio Suzuki as Dororo as she did an outstanding job at being the cheeky Dororo to life.<br />
<br />
There is currently no English Dub as from June 2019 then again the show has gained a big following from both vintages and casuals watching meaning the series will someday get a quality dub and I hope Bangzoom will be the ones that will dub it.<br />
<br />
Dororo is what an anime remake should be.<br />
It takes everything that was great about the original series from 1960s and expanded it to new heights with its beautiful presentation, smooth soundtrack, strong characters and intriguing plot that has a purpose.<br />
It did have a few faults along the way but the faults didn&#039;t shut down the grim and fascinating party.<br />
<br />
Amazing job MAPPA.<br />
You finally made a modern anime classic.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Dororo is a samurai story about demons, swords, body parts, humanity and this baby who is born without eyes and skin, so it basically looks the same as any newborn to all but its parents. Anyway, this baby dude has the same destiny as Moses and that one annoying nerd from the Disney movie which name I don&#039;t remember but it had something to do with singing in the middle of a desert. The difference being these over-grown skull bugs that wear clothes; giant weasels; and tentacle mud-monsters/other equally original looking monsters who eat people while classic Japanese music plays and old

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301408">
        men play banjo-swords or whatever while yelling out some one liners about evil things. Also, his father was robing hood. Naturally, a time skip occurs, followed by past stories because why should series ever start from where they actually start. If first impressions are meant to be important, then this one surely did one hell of a job convincing me it ain&#039;t gonna be gray (nor grey).<br />
<br />
My 2nd impression wasn&#039;t much better. Audio/lip out sync really rubs me the wrong way so of course Dororo&#039;s (the character Dororo) had to make her appearance by offering a speech approximately 70x worse than seen in anime typically, mainly reminding me of those cheesy youtube videos where dudes film some duck&#039;s peak movements orwhateverthefuck and try to dub it over to make it sound like its talking like a human. I felt physical pain when witnessing Dororo speak had no choice but the yell &#039;delete this&#039; out loud. Turns out all the mouth movement feat. audio is equally unfitting. Great.<br />
<br />
Had these been the biggest problems, I could have forgiven most, but the further the series has advanced the less impressed (positively) I have been. Dororo herself is a generic brat who is at best uninteresting and at worst annoying. A thief and a rebel who basically goes &quot;shuddap your not mi mum&quot; when trying to excuse her bullshit. The side cast is so black&#039;n white it feels like I am watching r/news. Dude goes literally evilz over puppies. Haven&#039;t seen this much quality since Guilty Crown, wonder when someone steals candy from kids. The main dude is so far a puppet who can kill and that&#039;s about it.<br />
<br />
The story has little to nothing to offer. Our dude is trying to discover his humanity/what humanity is by taking a road trip with the brat while collecting body parts and listening to her bullshit all the time. The catch being not all monsters are monsters and just by possessing a human body you can&#039;t necessarily achieve humanity or whatever. Very thought-provoking and important concepts being dealt with a manner so uninteresting and soulless I&#039;d much rather take the tedious/pretentious elitist circlejerk approach than this level of meh and eh. For example, one of the most memorable parts of A Song of Ice and Fire for me was when Maester Aemon (who is blind) calls Tyrion (who is a dwarf) a giant because of his personality. There is this thought that only the blind can see what person is truly like and I think that&#039;s a great idea. But what Dororo does with this exact same concept is unacceptable. Blind men literally yelling this same idea out loud like total assholes since, apparently, the writer of this thing couldn&#039;t come up with any better level of story telling, subtle or build up. Anything that could be meaningful and important is just thrown out in the air completely randomly. It&#039;s not a coherent story, just a collection of random ideas and events that simply occur and that&#039;s about it. It truly disgusts me. Since the story type is episodic, we get to meet bunch of empty side characters all the time and witness op swords fights. These episodes are practically the opposite of what Samurai Champloo had to offer and that doesn&#039;t seem to be a very good thing.<br />
<br />
Animation-wise, I have no idea what MAPPA is trying to do. Mimic DEEN&#039;s recent action shows? Especially the character movements are hideous. Outside the main cast, everyone looks like their body is made of clay or play-dough. The backdrops can be nice, but I haven&#039;t exactly had the time to look around and appreciate those because the pacing is ridiculous, the series doesn&#039;t rely on its good sides at all and everyone is too busy talking about demons and souls. The ost is not very good either. I thought water boarding was painful, but then I heard Dororo&#039;s opening song. A meme now. Like Jesus fucking christ ban this shit. It&#039;s so incredibly bad. The only mildly impressive thing here it the opening animation, but it is practically unwatchable unless muted. <br />
<br />
As a conclusion, the samurai genre is one of the strongest this industry has to offer, great many iconic titles produced in the past fall under it, but Dororo has so far been among the least impressive titles centering around this idea. I think it&#039;s great if this truly did work as an inspiration to titles such as The Lone Wolf &amp; Cub, Katanagatari, Vagabond, and Hyouge Mono, but as far as I am concerned, Dororo itself sucks ass. I typically never have problems understanding why people hate or love something, but as it currently is, I can&#039;t wait to see positive, in-depth analysis of this show because I completely do not understand with what type of perspective or mindset can this show seem good and appealing to anyone.

    This anime will certainly become a masterpiece. The animation is very detailed and has a beautiful artistic style that corresponds well to the dark period of the Sengoku during medieval Japan. The fighting scenes are well done and pleasant to watch. The soundtrack is superb and perfectly follows the animation.<br />
<br />
This anime has three main strengths that make me hope that it will become a great anime.<br />
<br />
First, the wealth of its history based on Tezuka&#039;s manga published in 1967. The story resembles a Japanese folk tale that tells, if we simplify, the journey of a cursed samurai who fights the Youkais. The narrative is very rhythmic,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302461">
        complex, intriguing and entertaining.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the themes dealt with in this tale and their interactions with each other: the search for political power at all costs, social castes, violence, misery, famine, human exploitation, massacres, the ability of individuals to be resilient and to adapt...<br />
<br />
Third, the development of the special relationship between the two main characters Dororo and Hyakkimaru plays a very important role in the work.<br />
<br />
&quot;I resubmit my review since it has been deleted by a moderator, because it was published after the 4th episode, so too early. I didn&#039;t know that rule :(  &quot;

    *Given the nature of the series itself, it’s hard for me to discuss it without at least mentioning mild spoilers. Also, there’s a RWBY spoiler in here. Proceed with caution.*<br />
<br />
With the exception of One Punch Man Season 2, Dororo is probably the most deflating anime I’ve seen so far in 2019. That’s honestly a real shame cuz on top of being a popular retelling of an anime from the ’60s, it&#039;s a 2000s samurai anime displaced in time. Furthermore, one of the main protagonists fights demons and samurai with swords for limbs! That sounds pretty cool, doesn’t it? Then halfway through the show, you realize

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311228">
        the cool moments are rendered moot and surrounded by mediocrity. Even worse, the show lost a lot of stream after peaking early on, causing the second half to become especially bothersome given the lackluster writing that permeates it. <br />
<br />
If nothing else, Dororo makes for a generally well-produced spectacle of samurai battles and bloodbaths. Even outside of the fight scenes, there are some incredibly well-animated sequences, like whenever demonic lightning would flash or when people or demons were burnt to ashes. At their best, the battles are crisp, fluid, and decently choreographed, with lots of sakuga moments where characters clash blades and get hacked to pieces. At their worst, they’re short, barely animated, and often replaced by animation shortcuts like static character portraits flashing in one after another, or slash marks on a black screen being followed up by a lack of anything satisfying, juicy, or vivid. The production values also worsen throughout the third quarter of the show in general, with bad CGI water, unriveting choreography and barely-animated fight scenes, several awkward shots and animation cuts, and overall inferior character models and animation throughout. None of this is horrible, not even the infamous episode 15 barring a few terrible sequences, but it does show that the production is a tad uneven. As for the character designs, at least for most of the main duo, they’re fairly attractive and mostly on-model barring a few stylistic changes throughout episodes and fight scenes (which are as hit or miss as the episodes themselves). Most of the secondary and tertiary characters are not very distinct or interesting and suffer from off-model syndrome a tad more, but it’s never anything heinous. As for the designs of the demons that are slain throughout the show, the only interesting ones were the ghost foxes that appeared halfway into the show, as well as a possessed horse near the end of the show. I also like the monochrome aesthetic, as it complements the atmosphere and designs of the show, especially when the animation kicks into high gear. It’s probably one of MAPPA’s more well-produced titles, even if nothing here is especially exciting.<br />
<br />
That’s where most of the compliments end, as the writing leaves a lot to be desired. I like the idea they were going with. It would have been interesting to see how the episodic stories impact Dororo and especially Hyakkimaru in their journey to slay demons and regain the latter’s humanity and body parts, which were robbed from him at birth. Having their escapades intertwine with the story of a falling kingdom and a family whose secrets unravel as specific members learn of Hyakkimaru’s survival could have been exciting. An overarching narrative where the characters often deal with episodic occurrences is certainly nothing bad, nor anything groundbreaking. One-off episodes are a great way of allowing for action spectacles and powerful moments that could impact character arcs tremendously. They also allow for more diverse narratives and world-building. Series such as Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, and Moribito are excellent examples of this. Dororo fails in all regards here, as most of the stories follow the exact same narrative beats and character archetypes, causing the side stories to lose any identity and worth by the second half. The show has a disconcerting number of one-off femme fatales, ridiculous psychopaths working with demons, and rambunctious kids wandering around to find a mother or sister figure they care about, both in the main story and the one-off episodes and arcs. If the one-off characters were more interesting and varied, or if the protagonists were more engaging, this wouldn’t be a big deal.<br />
<br />
Another major issue is how none of the side stories leave any real impact on our main duo. The only thing of note in most of these is how Hyakkimaru gets his body parts back. They did have an arc where Hyakkimaru had to deal with the shock of having ears again, forcing him to slowly and painfully adjust to the act of hearing. Had the series explored that concept with his other body parts and spaced them out better to allow for said exploration, I likely would have cared about Hyakkimaru a lot more. Sadly, at most, we get one-off lines about the differences in what he can do with his swords, only for him to still do the same things he always did, but with one less sword limb or with longer reach. Even worse, most of his developments after that point feel less gradual or tactile, and more “start and stop”. The worst examples are when in between episodes 12 and 13, he goes from barely uttering words to forming a complete sentence, or when in episode 20, he flips out due to a demon not granting him a body part back (an occurrence that has happened a few times by this point) and becomes a raging beast who wants his body and Dororo back during the final arc of the show before arbitrarily becoming more level-headed again in the finale. <br />
<br />
Backtracking to the non-impact issue, in the fifth episode, Hyakkimaru finds himself being taken care of by someone who he ends up having an affection towards. Meanwhile, Dororo interacts with her and the kids she’s taking care of, all while giving Hyakkimaru time to recover. At the end of episode 6, everyone who took care of them there dies, and Hyakkimaru goes on a rampage, killing almost everyone who murdered them. You’d think such an event would leave an impact on both of them, especially Hyakkimaru who finally found someone else he cared about that could help him. Apart from minor flashbacks in the middle of Dororo getting angry at someone, and a scene of another secondary character comforting Dororo, it means absolutely nothing and doesn’t get referenced in any meaningful way. I’m left with flashbacks to RWBY, when in Volume 3 Ruby watches Roman Torchwick get eaten after beating her up and challenging her heroic idealism with talk of how cold and nihilistic reality is. This scene comes between the death of two of her friends for an added gut punch. This is prime real estate for her to develop as a character (the main one at that) before Volume 4 completely has her going nowhere with this outside of two scenes of her feeling scared and horrible for what happened, causing her to completely abandon this idea outside of one scene in Volume 5 where she brings up the deaths of her friends. Hell, even that had more of an impact than what happened in this arc, which is still the most emotionally resonant arc in the series!<br />
<br />
None of this would matter too much if the characters were dynamic and colorful, cuz that would make it so even if an episode is only there for variety, it’s still engaging. Unfortunately, Dororo’s characters barely go beyond their character archetypes, and the ones who aren’t stock characters often leave a lot to be desired. I already discussed how poorly they handled Hyakkimaru’s development, which is a real shame since there are moments where he comes off as fun, even adorable with how he has to learn to really socialize with others on a level beyond that of a toddler. Dororo, by contrast, is far more lighthearted, sometimes even naive regarding “right and wrong”, as she’s a child. She’s an orphan that has watched her parents die and seen villages burn, and that completely clashes with how naive she is and how horrifying such violence seems to her in the first leg of the show, but she’s still a child. Speaking of clashing, her character trait of being a street rat who regularly attempts to swindle people or make a quick buck makes some of her more gullible actions in later episodes (15) seem entirely out of place. She has two sides to her that are fundamentally at odds with one another at times, resulting in a character that feels weak, on top of feeling shallow. That shallowness is compounded by the lack of development, a trait which only Hyakkimaru and one of the antagonists have any kind of access to (as dodgy as their development is). I know that a lack of character development is one of the tackiest, most misused complaints thrown at an anime, but when the characters are this shallow, and none of the side stories leave any kind of impact on a pair of characters consisting of a child and a person slowly gaining back and developing his humanity, I&#039;m left begging for something, anything to change before completely checking out by episode 18.<br />
<br />
I’m barely gonna touch on the side characters, even Hyakkimaru’s family and the people that serve them, as they’re mostly just boring character archetypes like the suffering mom, the warlord who cares about his nation almost as much as he does his reign over them, and the edgy, jealous younger brother who constantly tries to prove himself in order to not feel overshadowed. There’s also the wise, badass old man with some sense of humor. To be fair, the show does a fine enough job not screwing these characters up with dumb decision-making or erratic personality shifts, at least for the most part. It’s just that it’s hard to care about characters who are on autopilot, just as it’s hard to care about our main characters. There is one exception to the lack of character shifts, that being when in episode 12 Hyakkimaru’s brother suddenly goes from someone torn on the moral quandary of his brother’s life vs the nation that thrived off his unwilling sacrifice, to someone hell-bent on killing him after failing to end a deal between the demons who cursed Hyakkimaru, and his father who made a pact with them for the sake of power and a prosperous nation. Apart from that moment, you can predict every character’s archetype and actions the moment you see them. The only recurring character with anything to him is the guy that took care of Hyakkimaru for most of his life: Jukai. He has a genuinely horrific backstory that informs his somber nature and constant need to seek out ways for his craft to be used in ways that compliment life, something he feels he’s stuck with due to not having the right to die like everyone around him does.<br />
<br />
At this point, I’ll just list a few other issues with the writing. The characters arbitrarily doing stupid things for the sake of the plot in the second half, such as Dororo randomly falling for a trap door in a seemingly abandoned shack in episode 15 despite her being a trickster character who would never be this gullible, or Hyakkimaru not even thinking to chisel the rock trapping Dororo’s arm to free her as she’s drowning in episode 20. The old man conveniently shows up as a deus ex machina, and his first instinct is to chisel the rock and that lets Dororo get out of there, making this problem all the more aggravating. In the second half of the show, Hyakkimaru somehow knows where an important character is and tracks them down offscreen, not once, but twice despite there being nothing presented to the audience or to Hyakkimaru himself that could feasibly allow him to track them down. In episode 15, a village is consumed by fire and it’s blamed on an underground oil spill reacting to a moth demon randomly crashing onto a watch tower with a torch which subsequently exploded, except there’s no way it could have affected the oil in order to cause the fire to consume the village. The show also constantly beats you over the head regarding how tragic things are, and it often has the narrator or character reiterating what they’re doing. Apart from one spoiler-heavy moment a bunch of characters could have easily avoided if they had any sense of urgency, these are the only real big issues I can think of regarding issues with bad writing. The episodic narratives are generally fine enough on their own. It’s just that most of them feel rather samey and end up not mattering. The overarching narrative, despite being on autopilot, isn’t necessarily badly written either. It’s just unengaging thanks to the main character arc that drives the plot not being handled well and the characters being on autopilot.<br />
<br />
That just leaves the music, which is somehow my least favorite part of the show. The background OST has decent tone-setting tracks, but nothing memorable. Half the time, I didn’t even know there was a soundtrack. Then we have the OPs and EDs. I hate them all to varying degrees. The vocals in all of them are unbelievably grating, especially the first OP, which is probably one of my most hated anime songs of all time, let alone this year. The second OP is probably the most disappointing, as it starts off with a kickass grunge-like guitar solo for about 6 seconds before completely shifting gears and eventually succumbing to the problem of bad vocals. Unlike the EDs, the OPs stick, but it’s not out of me finding any appeal in them.<br />
<br />
I expected Dororo would lose steam eventually given what I had heard, but I wasn’t prepared for how the show ultimately became less than the sum of its parts. Apart from a few specific complaints, both the overarching narrative and the episodic and bi-episodic narratives are fine. It’s just that anything potentially interesting or emotionally resonant is completely undermined by a lack of cohesion between these two elements and how little impact anything seems to have. The characters certainly don’t help, as those that aren’t shallow archetypes aren’t handled with enough care for their plights to matter. The inconsistent spectacles aren’t enough to carry a show that feels so bog-standard and at-odds with itself. As a result, I largely stopped caring after a while, and that’s one of the worst feelings a promising show can inflict. There are moments where it picks up and the spectacle and emotions speak for themselves, but by the second half, I was usually either bored or on autopilot. I may not hate or dislike the show, nor do I think it’s terrible, but I’m left wondering why I bothered before asking myself what could have been.<br />

    Welcome to a quick synopsis, without spoilers, of this bloody story of Hyakkimaru and Dororo:<br />
<br />
Episodes 1 to 5: Best anime of the season!<br />
Episodes 6 to 10: A tear trickle from my eyes ...<br />
Episodes 11 to 15: Tears have become dark, thick blood<br />
Episodes 16 to 22: This is a pokemon ???<br />
<br />
Joking aside, the anime has a remarkable plot, because although simple it is very well executed. If you expect many fights, you will not see it here. If you like to cling to characters, you will surely love the story of Dororo and skillfully follow the revenge of Hyakkimaru on this trajectory of pain and perseverance.

    It&#039;s now time for another episode of Literaturenerd&#039;s too late reviews. Dororo was hot shit 2 years ago, but already most people have forgotten about it. A lot of critics felt this series was overhyped and it certainly was in 2019, but when you&#039;re focused on countering the hype wave, there&#039;s a tendency to downplay and go too far the other way. Dororo is actually a pretty good anime, it just didn&#039;t quite live up to its full potential. <br />
<br />
Dororo was based on a very old shonen from 1967 penned by Osamu Tezuka himself! Tezuka wanted to create a shonen version of traditional Japanese ghost

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409982">
        stories, so I warn you  the premise is pretty ridiculous. However, traditional Japanese ghost stories aren&#039;t aiming for realism. While Dororo isn&#039;t perfect and isn&#039;t considered up there with Tezuka&#039;s top works like Buddha and Phoenix, Tezuka was always a masterful storyteller who created fun plots, loveable characters, and infused his stories with a warmhearted humanism. There is plenty to like here in Dororo and this anime was directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi of Rurouni Kenshin fame.<br />
<br />
Dororo is about an evil Lord during the Sengoku Era who sacrifices his first born son named Hyakimaru to demons in exchange for power. The demons take Hyakimaru&#039;s eyes, ears, skin, central nervous system, heart, etc. The child is basically just a skeleton with a little muscle over his bones. However, Hyakimaru&#039;s righteous indignation is SO great that he refuses to die! He is sent downriver like baby Moses and is found by the world&#039;s greatest medical doctor. This doctor is named Jukai and he is probably the best character in this series. He was once a brutal samurai serving a ruthless lord and committed many atrocities. However, he was so filled with guilt and disgusted with himself that he threw himself off a cliff and into the sea. Fortunately, he was recovered by a Dutch ship who saved him and taught him the most advanced medical science known to Europe. With this new knowledge and his own genius, Jukai was able to make prosthetics hundreds of years more advanced than his peers and dedicates his life to treating the injured and repenting for his sins. In his spare time, he also carves LOTS of Buddha statues. Before you ask, yes he inspired the sculptor from Sekiro. Sadly, Jukai really isn&#039;t in this anime for more than a couple episodes. In fact, Hyakimaru himself doesn&#039;t get enough development and doesn&#039;t regain his speech until the very end of the series. Instead, most of the dialogue and the lion&#039;s share of the screen time is absorbed by a streetwise orphan named Dororo.<br />
<br />
The manga was for a young audience, so it made sense for Tezuka to add a child character. Not to mention the fact that manga is supposed to have dialogue and Hyakimaru can&#039;t talk. So Dororo&#039;s inclusion was a necessity. However, the 2019 anime is a lot darker and edgier than the original manga. They wanted to make a violent gore fest for older teens, but then the main character is this obnoxious little brat that talks big and needs to be rescued in every episode! Dororo is like if Scrappy Doo fused with Short Round from Temple of Doom. Why is he even in this freaking reboot?! Dororo adds very little to the actual plot, which is about Hyakimaru hunting down the demons one by one in order to get his organs back and eventually gather the strength to gain revenge on his father. I think the 2019 anime could have told Hyakimaru&#039;s story through facial expression and atmosphere with little dialogue and it would have been really cool. It feels like a wasted opportunity, but they REALLY wanted to be faithful to the manga. Speaking of which, the 1969 anime adaptation changed the manga&#039;s ending because they knew anime viewers would hate it. It worked in the manga because it was only 3 volumes, but when you stretch out the anime to a bunch of episodes, the manga&#039;s ending feels incredibly anti-climactic and frustrating. The 2019 Dororo actually followed the manga&#039;s ending and oh boy were people mad! Mushi Productions called that shit way back in 1969! They knew exactly how audiences would react. Even if you discount the ending, Dororo the 2019 anime really loses steam in the second half. This is unfortunate since the front half is really strong and showcases both Tezuka&#039;s strengths and Furuhashi&#039;s strengths as a director. Sadly, this wasn&#039;t an OVA that could run exactly as long as it needed. I think 12 episodes would have been too short and 24 episodes was too long. Ideally it should have run for about 16 episodes, but a TV anime can&#039;t do that.<br />
<br />
The art and soundtrack are serviceable for the most part. The action in the first half of the series looks pretty damn impressive although it starts to get stale by the end. Then we have the elephant in the room. As several critics before me have mentioned, it also has this hilariously bad CG fire that looks like they were using Windows Movie Maker from 2009. It looks like something you&#039;d see in a Youtube abridged parody from 10 years ago. None Piece had better fire effects than Dororo. <br />
<br />
So after everything I said, should you watch Dororo? You should definitely watch the first 10-12 episodes. Then if you want to continue you can. Just know that the back half is a little rough and kind of goes downhill. It&#039;s not Game of Thrones bad or anything, but definitely ends with a whimper instead of a bang.

    Last December I lost most of my eyesight, my ability to walk properly, I started having seizures, my speech became slurred, I no longer felt like I was in my body. Unable to do much I watched a lot of anime to try and distract myself while I got diagnosed. As soon as I watched the first couple episodes I related heavily to the main character due to losing the majority of my body functions. It was a scary time for me and I felt very hopeless. Watching each episode each week gave me hope that I may get better as well.<br />
<br />
I am slowly getting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307889">
        better and gaining back some of my senses but I have a long way to go I was diagnosed recently with a neurological disorder and will be doing physiotherapy to regain my ability to walk along with my other senses. <br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
The orginal Dororo was made in 1967 and I am not one for remakes but this has to be a masterpiece of a remake making its own while still not making it too distant from the original.<br />
The story is about a boy whose father gives up his sons life to demons in order to for his kingdom to prosper. Unknown to the father the boy still lives but, as cursed missing most of his body. The only sense left is his will to fight to get what was taken from him back. The pacing is never rushed and even subplots to the main plot are very interesting. Each episode brings more depth to the world giving the viewer a sense of the world building.<br />
<br />
Art:10/10<br />
The animation is easy to follow, but stunning at the same time. I am having issues with my eyesight and blacking out so shows like Mob pyscho 100 I have a hard time watching. Everything is extremely fluid and simple but at the same time, you have to take a moment to appreciate how much work and thought went into creating each scene. The fight scenes are amazing especially when Hyakkimaru takes off parts of his prosthetics to wield his swords built into his body. Everything has so much thought and passion put into it.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
The soundtrack is amazing and fit the environment of the show and its nature. I am having issues with my hearing but from the bits and pieces that I can hear it gives a similar feeling of upbeat at times making your heart race and at other times you will feel sad. The soundtrack reminds me of the Persona 3 soundtrack being dark but also upbeat at times not making it feel out of place.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
I feel that the atmosphere of this anime fits it perfectly it gives the audience a sense of dread of what dissociation feels like. None of the topics are taken lightly. Themes on demons with cosmic horror elements are brought into each plot. HP Lovecraft fans will love this show. The show is constantly questioning what it means to be human. Each character is relatable even when you are cheering for Hyakkimaru you will also feel bad for the villains at times. This is a world where is no good or bad only a will to survive suiting the timeline of feudal Japan very well.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
The main protagonist Hyakkimaru is not simple in aspects of understanding him. He is not the typical sulky pouting anime male character like Sasuke from Naruto he is complex. As he does not have some aspects of what people would say what it means to be human. Watching him become more human and develop allows the viewer to see him develop more with each episode. At times he can be considered the antagonist but anyone who put themselves in his shoes would probably do the same outcome. <br />
<br />
Dororo is the protagonist sense of humanity. Dororo brings a sense of humanity to Hyakkimaru as well Dororo has a childhood nativity even though Dororo was brought up in such a harsh world. Dororo background episodes are very sad and make you wish for Dororo and Hyakkimaru to complete their adventure so that they can live in peace together as a family.<br />
<br />
The demons and antagonists of the story are developed very well and bring a sense of world-building to the story. They are not good or bad at times they are just trying to live the same as Dororo and Hyakkimaru. It makes you question at times if it is actually good for him to get his body back when so many people may suffer as a result of different demons dying.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
<br />
I give this show a 10 because it has so much passion and thought put into it every detail keeps me amazed and I am very thankful I was able to watch this show. I look forward to the conclusion and more masterpieces to watch in this coming year. I recommend this show to everyone even if they do not enjoy shows that tend to be more serious and dark there is always light just like life. <br />

    Samurai (or bushi) were an integral component of Japanese history, impacting several aspects of society that still resonate in the modern day culture.  Their influence can be traced back to the Heian Period — around the late 8th to early 9th century — where they served the landed interests of the nobles who were preoccupied with the affairs of the imperial court.  Due to the diminishment of the emperor’s dominance over the country, the warrior class sought to fill the power void that culminated in the creation of the shogunate (a military government).  With political power and military might on their side,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311197">
        the samurai were poised to seize control of the country.  <br />
<br />
After the Genpei War of 1180 to 1185, in which the Minamoto clan prevailed over the Taira clan, the Kamakura Shogunate was formed, leaving the emperors and court nobility as mere figureheads, while the real power was wielded by the samurai who served the Daimyo (a vassal of the Shogun).  Samurai without a lord or master were considered rōnin — also known as a “drifter” or “wanderer” — who resorted to a life of crime to maintain their ruthless aura and keep themselves from starving.  Because of a general lack of knowledge, romanticizing samurai (particularly rōnin) in fictional works has become rather common in recent decades.  Hence, why Osamu Tezuka — the mangaka of Dororo — decided to amalgamate the samurai heritage with surrealistic demons to create an interesting narrative about a boy (Hyakkimaru) who roams the countryside to recover the limbs that were “stolen” from him, due to his father’s plead for power.<br />
<br />
In this regard, the story follows a predictable pattern of presenting new demons/monsters to be defeated by the accomplished samurai (Hyakkimaru) and the cunning orphan (Dororo).  Biwamaru — an old, blind man — also swoops in from time to time to help the two when the circumstances seem too dire (a fine example of plot-armor).  Besides the built in redundancy and overt plot conveniences, Dororo also suffers from inconsistent pacing.  Often times, the story meanders for large segments of time before commencing the next exhilarating battle.  This would not preclude the viewer from enjoying the show if the battles themselves delivered a worthwhile experience.  Yet the various scuffles seem like a blurred, unimaginative mishmash of gore and randomness.  No demon/monster did anything worth remembering, making each episode seem rather trivial.  Furthermore, numerous fights had inconsequential dialogue or cut away scenes that dragged out the proceedings unnecessarily — making the pacing quite unbearable.<br />
<br />
Hyakkimaru, the focal point of the series, was primarily used to fight demons to reclaim his stolen body parts.  Because of his unfortunate disposition, his development as a character was restricted.  As a consequence, Dororo was intended to bridge the gap by showing compassion to the various villagers the two came into contact with, and provide comedic relief from the grim adventures they engaged in.  That being said, Dororo’s childish antics were far from hilarious, and more often than not, were quite irksome.  He also served as a male, ‘damsel in distress’ for Hyakkimaru to save/protect on several occasions; except when Dororo got his arm stuck under some rocks in episode 20, and Hyakkimaru — unable to dislodge Dororo’s arm — proceeded to bash his head against said rocks in rage.  Perhaps Hyakkimaru thought the magical force of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (permanent brain damage) would propel the rocks somewhere else.  But despite his best efforts, telekinesis (and common sense) were not on his side.  And if it weren’t for Biwamaru conveniently saving the day, that would have been the end of Hyakkimaru and Dororo’s adventures.<br />
<br />
Similar to MAPPA’s previous production, Banana Fish, Dororo displays egregious actions — like rape and murder — to allow the viewer to sympathize with the characters and better understand their emotional suffering.  A wise decision, only if the mistreated characters were fleshed out enough to permit the viewer to actually care about their suffering.  Sure.  The natural inclination for any sane human is to commiserate with the offended individual, but artistic mediums require a scrupulous approach; otherwise, the desired outcome comes off as cheap window dressing.<br />
<br />
Speaking of cheap, Dororo’s animation was rather tacky for a modern anime.  It certainly did not offend the eyes, but neither did it generate a distinguished brilliance or captivate the viewer.  It, more or less, resembled the unremarkable, ordinary characters with its general lack of lively essence.  If Dororo, however, maintained this garden-variety quality for the duration the series, then all would have been well; however, it got worse.  Episode 15 was an abomination.  Hyakkimaru’s running through the forest looked like an early 90’s Mario game.  Character aesthetics were hazy, unfocused, and rough.  And the red hue of the fire blended in with the orange shading of the house (contrasting colors would have made the event more impactful).  The subsequent episodes, unfortunately, did not ameliorate these problems.<br />
<br />
While there were terrible portions of Dororo, it was not an unspeakable mess.  It was just an aseptic story that overly relied on sanguinary scenes to deceive the viewer into thinking it was greater than it truly was.

    Dororo (2019) is a real gem of an anime. It has a very interesting and dark story and shows steady yet justified character development. Hyakkimaru and dororo are the main charterers and well-focused on. In only a span of 24 episodes, the viewer gets very well attached to the main characters and envision their ups and downs. The main reason I liked this anime was its very unique storyline and beautiful character development. <br />
<br />
Music- 8/10 (battle music and openings are good)<br />
Story- 9/10 (great and interesting story but fast-paced ending)<br />
Animation- 9/10 <br />
<br />
<br />
In conclusion, it is a must-watch anime and is definitely worth your time.

    Tales of samurai and supernatural beings are commonplace in Japanese culture, and Dororo, an old anime that has gotten a reboot after decades, is one such story. This anime tells your typical story of a man wronged by practically everything ever who goes on a journey to discover himself. No, not in a spiritual sense or whatever like you might suspect. This dude is literally searching for his body parts. Which, might I add, were sacrificed to demons by his dad. Yeah, it&#039;s pretty intense. Unfortunately, while the creator of Dororo thought up quite the dark and gruesome setting for his work, he failed to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311185">
        convey a significant message due to a variety of both narrative and technical flaws.<br />
<br />
The stoy centers around Hyakkimaru and his child companion Dororo as they travel around the country slaying demons who have stolen Hyakkimaru&#039;s body parts. They also encounter both friend and foe along the way. The problem is that this anime lacks central  direction. It takes an episodic approach for the most part that features a bunch of hit or miss (for me they mostly miss, bruh) side stories that don&#039;t really go anywhere. They feature new characters who are usually killed off or never seen again and the episodes don&#039;t really contribute to the narrative. I mean Hyakkimaru just comes in, kills some monsters, grows some body parts, and then moves on with Dororo in tow. There&#039;s next to no development of any character in such episodes and they have practically no impact on the overarching story. Only a few of the mid and the last several episodes tackle the the central conflict between Hyakkimaru and his family. And these episodes actually aren&#039;t that bad. They address themes such as the value of one weighed against the value of a land filled with many and feature some interesting confrontations. Had this anime been one cour and more focused, I might have actually found it to be decent. Unfortunately, it&#039;s just held back by a plethora of bland and in some cases plain bad episodes.<br />
<br />
One of my problems is that I don&#039;t really get a lot of the traditional Japanese monsters/spirits. Call me uncultured or whatever, but when I see a dude riding sharks or a giant floating baby head thingy, I can&#039;t take the story seriously. I think the plot is at its best when it doesn&#039;t have a bunch of weird creatures that spawn out of nowhere to randomly help or hinder the protagonist. Plus most of the demons that Hyakkimaru fights are usually bland creatures with no originality. Now there are a select few that I did enjoy and thought were handled well, like the spider lady. Nonetheless, I found most of these monsters to be pretty mediocre. I get that this is a supernatural show and not some historical documentary, but I honestly think that its fantasy elements were generally utilized poorly.<br />
<br />
Studio MAPPA obviously isn&#039;t known for having pristine animation, but their works usually incorporate eye catching color schemes and the like to make up for the generally average animation of their shows. Yet with Dororo, I just couldn&#039;t help but be bored by its visual presentation. I get that its monochrome look fits with the style of the story it&#039;s trying to tell, but its dull and uninspired visage left more to be desired. Top that off with the plain character designs and uninspired backgrounds, and you get what I find to be a poorly animated anime.<br />
<br />
The most annoying aspect of Dororo would have to be the voice of the titular character herself. I rarely give harsh criticism on voice acting, but this seiyuu unfortunately deserves it. I would cringe internally almost every time she spoke. My poor eardrums just couldn&#039;t take it! Okay, I might be exaggerating a bit, but I just didn&#039;t like her performance. Maybe her voice sits fine with you, but I for one just couldn&#039;t wait for her to stop talking. The other voices were, uh, fine I guess? None of them were really that memorable to be honest.<br />
<br />
Speaking of forgettable, how about dem characters! I&#039;ve already mentioned how annoying I find Dororo to be, but how about everyone else? The best one to start with would of course be Hyakkimaru. He has a pretty messed up origin story, which was the sole reason as to why I bothered to watch this anime in the first place. His character is basically what you would expect from a lifeless husk of a man...you know, lifeless. And empty. He&#039;s honestly a pretty boring character who instead of developing just seems to get more angry as the show goes on. Which I guess you could call development from a certain point of view, but I don&#039;t see it that way. His stagnant nature only serves to hurt the story. The saving grace would be the bond between Hyakkimaru and Dororo. I thought their chemistry was good, and the development of their relationship was handled a lot better then the development of their individual characters. <br />
<br />
As I mentioned before, the rest of the cast are pretty bland, though there are a few stand outs who, uh, still don&#039;t really stand out that much. I&#039;ll give some of them a brief mention. There&#039;s this old priest dude who is wise and stuff but doesn&#039;t really contribute to the story. There&#039;s a cute girl named Mio who had potential, but was grossly underutilized. Hyakkimaru&#039;s parents are ok, and they honestly fulfil their role well enough. I think Tahoumaru was handled well for five seconds before they turned him into a carbon copy of his father. The last character I&#039;d like to mention is Itachi, who actually ended up being my favorite character in the show despite his small amount of screen time. The way the anime made him out to be so despicable yet make me actually like him by the end was impressive, and I have to commend the good writing of his character.<br />
<br />
Since I don&#039;t want to be all edgy and depressing like this anime, let&#039;s end on some positives! Dororo boasts some pretty great music, and I do enjoy the more traditional Japanese pieces. The first opening theme song is of course the highlight of the sound department. It gets bonus points for fitting perfectly in my own vocal range, so I sing it like, a lot (to the misfortune of those around me I&#039;m sure). As much as I bashed Dororo&#039;s execution, I do think that the premise is quite interesting and unique. Hyakkimaru&#039;s predicament really is a cool concept. I just wish it was handled more appropriately. And as much as I disliked the show&#039;s episodic approach, I did end up liking a few of the stories. Though of course the main conflict between Hyakkimaru and his family ended up being the best part of the show that kept it from sinking into awful territory in my eyes.<br />
<br />
Being grim and violent doesn&#039;t automatically make something deep and thought provoking. Dororo tries hard to tackle dark concepts, and you know what? It succeeds. It just fails to do anything significant with its dark material in my eyes, and it ended up being quite mediocre because of it.

    Miracles do exist and Dororo is proof of that. By all accounts something like Dororo should never have been made. I’m not saying it’s bad, in fact quite the contrary. The Dororo manga is old, really old. Up until late last year I had never heard of it before. Typically the only anime that gets green lit is stuff that is relevant. Stuff that people are currently talking about. Pretty much the opposite of Dororo. Yet someone took a chance and decided to adapt it and I could not be more happy with their decision. <br />
<br />
The story of Dororo is quite simple and easy to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311214">
        follow. It’s the story of a young man on a quest to regain what was stolen from him. In his current state you could call him an inhuman monster. Probably a bit harsh but when you have been robbed of everything that makes you physically human what are you left with. As the story goes on our main character Hyakkimaru regains those lost limbs but at what cost. I really loved the theme that Dororo went with. It’s all about give and take. For every piece of your human body you try to obtain, a bit of your humanity is lost. It’s a complex question ripe for intelligent discussion and Dororo handles that question masterfully. <br />
<br />
While most of our focus and attention story wise is put on Hyakkimaru the anime is called Dororo for a reason. As an audience we are seeing things play out mostly through Dororo’s eyes who exists mostly as comic relief to keep the show lighthearted enough so that we are not bogged down by Hyakkimaru’s unending quest for vengeance. Dororo plays a perfect host for this journey and a great companion. Just because Dororo is a kid doesn’t mean they can’t be useful. In fact that’s something I want to point out. Typically child characters in anime are a nuisance. They are annoying, a liability in any given situation and frankly there to cause problems. The thing I like about Dororo is that Dororo is intelligent. Dororo helps our protagonist on his journey. Not just with the demons but also making sure Hyakkimaru does not fully lose what little humanity he has left. Other characters that have relevance include a wise wandering old man who you could call a sensei for Hyakkimaru when it comes to navigating this world. Sometimes he pops in to lend a helping hand but is never overbearing nor a deus ex machina, and he is always giving sagely words of wisdom both to the main characters and us as well. Of course what story is complete without an antagonist. The antagonist for Dororo revolves around Hyu’s father and brother even. What I like about Dororo’s portrayal of the antagonists is their motives for their actions make sense. They are not bad for the sake of being bad. Any other story and they would be the heroes instead. A well fleshed out hero for a story is nice but a well fleshed out villain can definitely elevate some series to the level of greatness. Throw in some meaningful side characters and Dororo has all the makings of a fantastic anime.<br />
<br />
The art and animation for this story received quite the facelift. The original manga that I peeked has a comic like cartoony style of animation that may have worked for the time it was made but would need to be updated for a modern audience. The choice to update the designs was a great decision on the studios part. As for animation, wow. I was not expecting a show like Dororo to look as good as it did. Everything moved and flowed nicely. Most action scenes featured breathtaking sequences that you rarely see these days. There was a bit of a hiccup for one episode which depending on your taste could be very good or very bad. Fortunately it only lasts for one episode and then everything goes back to normal afterwards. <br />
<br />
The sound for Dororo was great especially the first opening song. It’s straight fire which going by some of the lyrics is an accurate description. The ending song is nice too, almost has a sort of ballad feel to it. The 2nd OP and ED are good too but the first set is what defines the series sound wise. <br />
<br />
I really hope that more studios in the future look to anime like Dororo and decide to take a chance on older works. There are so many great stories out there that deserve to be adapted and given the same respect that Dororo was given. This is certainly a classic in the making.

    I came into this anime with zero expectations, but I’m sure if I had any, they would’ve been blown away by now. <br />
<br />
The story is dark and uncompromising, but not overly complex. Who the villain is and the objective for Hyakkimaru is pretty clear from the get-go. It&#039;s the journey that matters. His companion is a boy named Dororo, a thieving little smartass that thankfully doesn’t lean in too hard into that trope. His genuine concern for Hyakkimaru, as well as his earnest reactions towards the world he lives in, make him endearing instead of annoying. The two of them are an odd pair, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301608">
        it works to add some wholesomeness into what is otherwise a brutal world.<br />
<br />
And this anime is brutal, no doubt about it. Hyakkimaru’s journey is littered with people who are affected by the wartime era they find themselves in; people who have learned to cope with war, others who seek to atone for their sins during war, and yet others who have been destroyed by war. Then there’s Hyakkimaru himself, someone who has had everything taken from him (quite literally) and is driven by the single-minded pursuit to get it all back. I wouldn’t say the anime goes so far has to be hopeless, but it is definitely bleak.<br />
<br />
The animation is beautiful, matching the grimness of the world while having some great action scenes. And the OP is straight fire, been having it on repeat for days.<br />
<br />
If you aren’t watching this anime right now, I cannot recommend it enough. <br />

    I dropped it after 8 episodes. I&#039;m aware that it&#039;s 24 episodes long, but after 8 weeks I couldn&#039;t stand to waste any more time watching it. It sucks.<br />
<br />
I like the premise. The protagonist Hyakkimaru travels across Japan fighting demons to regain body parts which were stolen from him prior to his birth. His father made a deal with the underworld so that his domain would receive protection against natural/unnatural disasters plaguing Japan. This deal imposes a curse on Hyakkimaru. He&#039;s is born deaf, mute, and somewhat blind, but is somehow adept at fighting with his prosthetic arms which also double as swords. He eventually

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304497">
        regains many of his senses after defeating demons, as this magically causes him to regain his missing body parts after they&#039;re defeated. He&#039;s befriended by a young character named Dororo on the journey who provides dialogue that would otherwise be missing given that Hyakkimaru is mute early on.<br />
<br />
That sounds cool. I should like this anime, but I was bored out of my mind by episode 3. <br />
<br />
The show is too formulaic. Hyakkimaru stumbles around Japan running into monsters along the way. He usually has two demonic encounters per episode where he loses the first fight, but comes back later and wins. He regains a body part. Fights another monster. Regains another body part. Repeat. Eight episodes in and that&#039;s all that happens. There&#039;s a cool encounter with samurai/bandits around episode 6 that I was hoping was going to kick start the story into something interesting, but it went back to monster of the week garbage the next two episodes. And the fights aren&#039;t good at all. Maybe I&#039;m spoiled by anime like Shigurui or Ninja Scroll, because the battles (outside of one fight a few episodes in) are seriously underwhelming. Short and very much uninspired. Even the creatures look like generic low detail Naruto garbage. They&#039;re demons yet they&#039;re not scary at all. In fact, there&#039;s little horror on the show. It could have been so much better in this aspect given the premise of the show.<br />
<br />
The only parts of the show I liked were the opening animation and theme. The great Ziyoou-vachi provides the fantastic opening theme. And unlike the rest of the show, the opening animation is pretty cool looking.<br />
<br />
I wanted to like this, but before I gave up on it I was asking myself if I was forcing myself to like it. Cool op, cool premise, and fans have been raving about it yet eight episodes in I couldn&#039;t understand why.

    It&#039;s probably still to early for me to be writing this review since the show only has 6 episodes so far, but this anime is amazing. When I first heard about Dororo I hadn&#039;t seen the original so I watched it, and let me say, the 2019 version does more than live up to the original. The theme song takes you away and leaves you in awe. The story has been changed a little bit, Dororo can&#039;t talk so it makes the dialogue more interesting. The character development shows, with Hyakkimaru reclaiming his body he eventually gets his voice back and can now hear what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301878">
        Dororo says. Dororo learns from Hyakkimaru and follows him on his journey to get his body back. So far I love where this anime is going, I just hope it doesn&#039;t turn out to be one of those 13 episode anime. The story is moving fast but it is very well paced. For this reason I give Dororo a 9.

    Writing this review makes me very sad. This show started out as the underdog for anime of the season. Story was interesting, characters were unique, and a smashing OP that I still listen to.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, somewhere in between the episodic nature of the show got to me. Character development is weak, besides the literal (physical) character development there really isn’t much else. After episode 12, the animation has gotten lazy. I don’t know if the production schedule got too tight or what but with all the stills and lack of action it hurts to watch. The plot has gotten repetitive and the new OP is nothing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307809">
        compared to the first one.<br />
<br />
Overall, the show has just gotten boring, it’s sad to see because I want more 24episode series to go through and do well and I was hoping this would be it. but I feel like I already know what’s going to happen. You can guess the ending of every episode. I really hope they rebound with 8 episodes left but I’ve been trying to hang on for as long as possible and I don’t know how many more weeks I can take.

    Time to add my voice to the choir of high-praise. <br />
<br />
But lets not get ahead of ourselves, if you&#039;re on the fence about Dororo or simply do not know much about it then i should preface by saying that this show is emotional. It is dark and brooding at times, and it does it WELL. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve seen a decent number of &quot;intense&quot; animes and half the time it&#039;s hard for the characters emotions to be taken seriously as the situations causing them feel so contrived and &quot;well it had to happen for the plot&quot;, which obviously takes away from some of our capacity to engage

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301439">
        our emotions and empathize with what were seeing. <br />
Having just completed episode 6 of Dororo I can say that so far it has avoided this pitfall incredibly well! <br />
<br />
The show is episodic to a degree, but each episode is clearly pushing a very obvious goal with a specific time-limit. It&#039;s reminiscent of the classic &quot;monster of the week&quot; style, but done RIGHT. Done with the knowledge that after each confrontation (at the end of 18 minutes of jaw-droppingly good character development i should add) the MC&#039;s goal is progressed that one step closer, and a new twist is created, and new side of the characters, that you quickly grow to love, is now there to be experienced. I promise you it&#039;s a good ride, even if you may sob a dozen or so times by the time this anime finishes. <br />
<br />
This anime is top-shelf ladies and gentlemen. If you&#039;re looking for a show that is serious, without being cringe, and has stellar characters, you&#039;ve come to the right place.

    When i first saw this show and watched the few episodes i was quite interested. The premise was not bad and unlike most other anime and it seemed quite promising. As episodes came out I started noticing a pattern... as of the 8th episode i dropped it and i don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be picking it up anytime soon.<br />
The setting and story are intriguing during the first episodes soon started to give me the feeling of filler. Oh, new characters, cool. Oh wait, they&#039;re gone. No subplot or progression is to be found other than what we started with and I feel like the whole thing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303022">
        is kind of videogamey. Gear up to beat the big bad boss, one bodypart at the time. Also, almost every side character seems to be wearing a damn full plate of plot armor, giving off the lukewarm happy ending in most episodes, with a few exceptions, which i did certainly not expect from a show like this. 5/10<br />
The art is a sad topic... Very basic and unpolished. Not much more to say. 3/10<br />
The only saving grace of the show is the soundtrack. The OP is absolutely killer and although less memorable i think the ED suits the vibe of the show much better. Overall both are very good. The not-so-good part comes in during the show: although not so frequently i noted quite a few lip-synching issues and i found the voice acting definetly subpar but at least it&#039;s not too bad. All in all 7/10<br />
Apart from Hyakkimaru pulling off some pokemon evolution stunts there isn&#039;t much in terms of character development and they mostly feel quite superficial and at times an incoherent mess. Much of the time their actions are dictated by plot necessities and tropes, such as &quot;we have to help random strangers&quot; and &quot;I have this sad backstory thought up and written in 5 minutes. Feel bad for me&quot;. Overall nothing worth writing home about at best and mildly infuriating at worst. 3/10<br />
I really hate this show, not because it&#039;s bad, it&#039; s at least watchable and there is far worse, but because i actually thought it would be at least good and had quite high hopes for it. A few of the problems can be justified, it is the adaptation of a 52 year old manga, but not all. It came across as lazily produced and rushed, transforming a possible insight of the journey of a tortured soul through a monster filled land on his path to redemption to a grindfest of bodyparts and meaningless quests, sprikled with random sophistry. It&#039;s simply disappointing. I would not normally write a review for a show i haven&#039;t completely seen but i somehow don&#039;t believe it will get much better given the other 16 episodes. I guess i would give the anime a total of 4 sad bodyparts/10
