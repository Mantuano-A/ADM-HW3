    Before the &quot;what the fuck is wrong with you, a 5 on a ghibli movie, kill yourself&quot; settles in, I want to assure you that the movie did everything that it set out to be outstandingly and if I was from that target audience, I would probably consider it nothing short of a masterpiece. I usually prefer to criticize a show for what it tried to be but failed while presenting every factor I deemed important about the movie and why eventually it was only an average experience for me. In this case, I don&#039;t have a lot to criticize on what the movie actually

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218909">
        tried to do because it was succesful in what it did. So all I can present is what factored into my experience only a 5 with what the movie has had done and has not done.<br />
<br />
Starting with the movie&#039;s strong suits, the artistic side of it is outstanding. While the obligatory &quot;for its time, it looks incredible&quot; compliment must be said, I&#039;ll do one more and say that for our time, I wish people would pay as much attention to detail in animation as was done in Tonari no Totoro and would look at least half as good. The animation has plenty of small details throw in that makes each frame look lively and realistic. As an example there will be some scenes with children crying. Have you ever seen someone cry in an anime? I will assume that most of the time, depending on what you watch of course, crying doesn&#039;t rise any red flags. However, watching a child cry in this made me realize something. Most people don&#039;t even put any effort into the way they display someone crying and see it as something simple and easy to portray. However, in Totoro, when the child started crying I could see the range of emotions she went through and react realistically, the same way any child of that age would. All down to the point of starting to cry silently because she was upset then up to the outburst of emotion, screaming and bawling as soon as she was given attention again the way children do when they are given attention in these situations. It may seem a ridiculous thing to pick out the level of detail for animation, but that&#039;s what I found most impressive. The range of emotions displayed in a few frames was done as right as anyone could ever do them and I can&#039;t imagine someone outdoing this kid.<br />
<br />
Ok, now the movie so far was 10/10 children cry real. Anyway, up next I&#039;m gonna talk about, more of the art, and rather, its significance in this movie. You see there&#039;s a point to the art actually being this well animated and that is that its goal is to be as captivating as anything can be. Yeah, sure, anything has to be captivating, but in this situation, you have to keep in mind, the audience was intended to be children. Children are impressionable. And I assure this was artstyle was very impressive if it still is today back then. But the reason it also has to be captivating it is because it&#039;s trying to display the innocence of children, which is the artistic goal of the movie. Which it does. Quite well. To the point where everyone praises it. So I praised it on that front enough. But I have to add, since its audience seemed to have been children, it has build an impressive world with imaginative designs in a realistic looking manner. To the point where adults can watch it to feel like a kid again and children can watch it to be amazed by the movie&#039;s world.<br />
<br />
But here&#039;s where my praise stops and my gripes with the movie starts... well... you see... I was bored. Yes, despite the amazingly looking visuals that occasionally made me so impressed I forgot all about how bored I was for a short while and despite being 100% on board with what the movie has displayed, I still was bored. Why? Because it is mostly comprised of the children fucking around and showing off how well designed everything is, as well as put focus on what they&#039;re trying to display in the movie. The movie piles on a lot and a lot of scenes together for artistic value and to continuously display how innocent a child is. I get it. So what?<br />
<br />
What do you mean &quot;so what?&quot;, that&#039;s the point of the movie?<br />
<br />
Yes, and why would I watch something solely meant to display that. Quite frankly, there&#039;s a lot of things intended for kids that are sweet, innocent and whatnot and have a point in their story, even if simple and meant for children to understand and teach them good values. However this movie spends an hour on children and then realizes something needs to happen as for the story to have some sort of tension by the point where you&#039;d have ingrained the target audience into your brain and know everything&#039;s gonna be alright. The story is a tool to display art, rather than to display a engaging narrative.<br />
<br />
Yeah, but the story&#039;s goal was to show off the children&#039;s innocence. It&#039;s only your fault if you can&#039;t appreciate that. <br />
<br />
Yeah, finally something that we can agree. Frankly if you enjoy a movie that is artistic and the theme that I&#039;ve described in the review, it will be outstanding. But do you enjoy stories? Do you enjoy it when you learn something? Do you enjoy it when you see someone have some sort of struggle and have some type of conflict? Do you enjoy it when something you watch tries to drive home a point or multiple points? Are you entertaining by these things? Because they are absent here. As a child or enough of a childlike mentality, you could admire and yonder or feel nostalgic over how your own childhood was due to the movie, but, if that&#039;s not what you&#039;re looking for... You&#039;re likely to get bored... just like me. Unless you&#039;re watching it for the amazing visuals. In which case, congratulations again.<br />
<br />
Most often times when something succeeds in what it sets out to be it is often free of criticism because there is no point to it because it&#039;s already succeeded. But just because it succeeded in something doesn&#039;t mean it will succeed in entertaining you. If narrative is something you really want in the movie, a series of connected events that do drive a point across, this is not something you should watch. If you value the artistic side of a show more than anything, this is a masterpiece that you should not miss, this movie is for you.

    Childhood is a blossoming period of learning and developing one&#039;s own idiosyncrasies. It has always been a sedate stage in which little youngsters define themselves through their senseless antics—ones that appear innocent but are of an elusive nature, and are merely an inadvertent expression of the capricious phase that is childhood. However, since kids are so full of youthful tendencies, very few directors have managed to portray the rascals in a sincere and realistic manner. But among those select few is an irreplaceable Ghibli film which has become a sensation both within its native community and the western world—and that film is Hayao Miyazaki&#039;s My

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113993">
        Neighbor Totoro.<br />
<br />
My Neighbor Totoro is, simply put, a child&#039;s imagination brought to life; fanciful tales that become reality, replete with picturesque wonders that reveal the magical and mysterious. Hidden from adult eyes, the otherworldly rewards only those of pure heart. Spirits and mystic guardians of the forest, they embody the creativity and candidness of children—content to experience the simple joys of life and the beauty of nature. With down-to-earth characterization, Satsuki and Mei are splendid lenses into the film&#039;s world, their optimism and enthusiasm ensuring every little discovery resonates with the audience—a magical tale that is an adventure for kids, and an opportunity to revisit childhood for adults; a genuine moment of reflection. <br />
<br />
Although the setting lacks depth, My Neighbor Totoro alleviates this by deftly weaving together fantasy and realism. Very little is explained and detailed, but its integration of the imaginary is both natural and unobtrusive. A big house nestled amidst greenery, uninhabited for decades, a likely home to the mysterious. Satsuki and Mei, true to their age, are explorers of the unknown—their interactions with the rich environment are not only a delight to observe, but also a reflection of the curiosity inherent within every child. <br />
<br />
Unveiled with mystique, uncanny soot creatures emerge from the house&#039;s floor and scamper into the shadows as the heroines enthusiastically tour the dark rooms of their new abode. Even if slightly scared at first, Satsuki and Mei&#039;s fear quickly gives way to curiosity, then excitement, and finally delight. The two adventurous sisters stumble upon a new world, and like any child would, wholeheartedly embrace its magic. This very sense of wonder is what leads them to the mythical spirit Totoro, protector and guardian of the forest. Intimidating in size, but gentle in nature, the fuzzy giant embraces the two of them with otherworldly tenderness. In an ever-so-subtle way, he becomes a link between the characters and the forest itself, introducing them to many of its magic wonders.<br />
<br />
In essence, My Neighbor Totoro is more about inspiring one&#039;s imagination—an honest message about the importance of childhood and a connection with nature—than creating a fantasy backdrop. Complexity is absent, but the presentation is delivered with finesse and flair. Much of this is due to the laid-back pace and the amiable guidance of the protagonists, slowly hinting at the mysteries that may be hidden in the nooks and crannies of dark rooms and lush forests. All the viewer needs to do is to sit down, relax, and enjoy the magic unfold.<br />
<br />
Allowing their daughters the liberty to go and explore the surroundings of their new home, Satsuki and Mei&#039;s parents are often absent physically, but present in spirit. As caring guardians, the parents concern themselves with their troublesome daredevils in an earnest and honest fashion. These carefree dynamics connect the otherwise distant adult world with the children&#039;s, instilling a sense of trust and intimacy among the family. In this sense, Miyazaki makes a conscious effort of displaying human relationships in a sincere and natural style.<br />
<br />
True to Ghibli&#039;s reputation, My Neighbor Totoro&#039;s visuals are masterfully crafted with great attention to even the most minute details. Rich with body language and facial expressions, the screenplay succeeds in the art of showing and not just telling, breathing nuance and realism into the cast&#039;s actions and interactions. These subtleties add striking believability to the characters, as adults and children alike look and behave according to their ages. The physical environments, too, are vividly detailed, setting the stage for the integration of the cast and fantasy—be it the cluttered rooms of a house recently moved into, or the green vastness and richness of the countryside.<br />
<br />
Likewise, the film&#039;s sound department is remarkably well-polished. Joe Hisaishi&#039;s compositions harmoniously blend with the mood of the scenes—the tempo is upbeat in situations of excitement and discovery, while smooth when tension is low. The timing is delicate, but more than anything, the tracks themselves are what stand out most. Charming and varied, the melodic tunes make extraordinary scenes even more memorable. The careful management not only soothes body and mind, but also permits the soundtrack to lace key scenes with vivid and meaningful tonality. Interesting to note, though, is that for most of the movie, there is no background music. Instead, focus is placed on environmental sounds, allowing the countryside setting to weave its own atmosphere. In concordance with the naturalistic tone of the story, this adds a more organic touch to the presentation—one focused on painting nature in its purest form. <br />
<br />
A tale intended for kids, yet a journey fit for audiences of all ages, My Neighbor Totoro is a splendid story that encapsulates the beauty of childhood. The film&#039;s wonderful portrayal of Satsuki and Mei&#039;s imagination conveys a true sense of jollity present in most children. Beyond its realism, the film delivers a dazzlingly magical experience by way of its supernatural encounters with the manifestations of nature. But this occurs ever so gently, that one could consider it a dream-like tale that both begins and ends in blissful serenity. A true classic, My Neighbor Totoro will remain in the hearts of many as a heartwarming experience of one of the purest and most beautiful memories: a frolicsome childhood, never to be forgotten.<br />

    I remember Totoro was my favorite anime. I&#039;d pop it in the VCR player (yes, old school, I know) and watching it with my little brother when I was a little girl. Somewhere around 14 years later, it&#039;s still my favorite movie, and probably always will be.<br />
<br />
Totoro&#039;s story is incredible: it captures the imagination of two girls with very different personalities. Satsuki, the older, responsible girl who takes care of household responsibilities while her mother is sick, and little Mei, a veritable firecracker who&#039;s curiosity knows no limits. What made this movie so incredible was how well it captured the imagination of kids their age.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7865">
        Just watching it makes you think back about all those fun things you did when you were younger, whether you&#039;re helping your parents with chores or you&#039;re outside picking acorns off the grass. I think thanks to this movie, I spent a good chunk of my childhood looking through bushes and trying to find crevices in trees so I could find where Totoro&#039;s house was! Ah, lots of memories...<br />
<br />
Miyazaki&#039;s artwork is stunning. Despite the fact that by now, it&#039;s obviously somewhat older, the animation is still superior to anything Disney can throw at us. His specialization in artwork of nature make this film a delightful piece of eye candy.<br />
<br />
The music! How cute! The opening sounds like one of those little tunes my mother would sing to me in Korean when I was younger. I&#039;ve always loved the music in Miyazaki&#039;s movies and this one is no exception.<br />
<br />
Totoro is easily still my favorite movie in the world for over a decade. Highly recommended to watch, rewatch, and watch with everyone else.

    This movie is perfect, in its own deeply weird way. It is indestructibly built and sprawlingly self-contained. It spends its brief runtime on just half a dozen characters and fewer locations, but i really don’t know if there is a more exhaustive way to explore its heartbreaking, intimate views on hope and dread.<br />
<br />
Miyazaki’s best works always embrace the undercurrent of darkness in his concepts, touching on the unsettling to bring the levity more weight. It’s the same here—the threat of death is always present, either Mei&#039;s or her mom’s, and the entire film is constructed around the rambling search for a miracle to save their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review391337">
        mother’s life. The mom’s sickness remains in the background the whole time, generalizing her disease to an unshakable feeling of bad things on the horizon. And there is nothing Satsuki or Mei can ever do to stop it but live their lives like they believe in the fantastical and have never had a worry in their life. Which they do! Darkness and levity, side by side. <br />
<br />
In this movie the impossible and the real both exist, superimposed. If Totoro is real, then their mom can get better, then their family can end up okay. And he both is real and isn’t, in the same contradictory way that you have hope for the best to get by while knowing that it will never come true in order to act on the chance of succeeding anyway. The dream of Totoro&#039;s tree was true but it wasn’t; the miraculous is not singular but all around us, shrouding even the most commonplace things in an indelible sense of magic.<br />
<br />
Probably, their mom will die. The dad knows, and the kids know too, somewhere deep inside. But in that moment when Miyazaki cuts to credits, you believe wholly and overwhelmingly that she *will* get better and that things will turn out alright, regardless of the odds. It posits not that hope is effective or powerful—not that it produces results—but that it is indispensable to not break down in the face of it all. That it is an integral part of the human condition. Totoro’s power as a symbol, the microscopic miracles that make up the world around us, is that he lets you believe in the macroscopic miracles as well.<br />
<br />
The climate crisis of a civilization is happening in our lifetime. The biggest police brutality protests in a half-century have just accomplished absolutely nothing. We are in the middle of a pandemic that will probably kill tens of thousands more before it’s done. As i am writing this, the future looks terrible—and honestly, nihilism would probably be a perfectly reasonable response. Probably, the earth will collapse in on itself. Probably, Joe Biden will continue in the esteemed tradition of austerity politics and leave vast swathes of the country out to rot in the pandemic and decay in the recession. Probably, we will see police shoot another Black man sometime next year. But in the face of such all-consuming dread and uncertainty, you have to hope. And you have to recognize that hope will do nothing. And you have to do what you can.<br />
<br />
This movie means a lot to me. Joe Hisaishi is a legend. Miyazaki is a genius.

    Another win for Miyazaki!<br />
<br />
The story was just unique. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve seen anything like it &amp;ndash; and originality is always a good thing. It had me watching closely the whole time. It&amp;rsquo;s a story for kids and kids at heart alike.<br />
<br />
It was like watching a Dr. Seuss story come to life, except it has a Miyazaki spice to it. Another good thing about it is that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand, but not so easy that it&amp;rsquo;s dumb.<br />
<br />
The characters were all very likable. I like adorable Mei, and her doting older sister Satsuki. I also love how their father is so child like &amp;ndash; he&amp;rsquo;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review458">
        definitely not one of those stern looking dads. Finally, Totoro and is companions were fun to watch. I kinda want to meet him myself.<br />
<br />
And because it&amp;rsquo;s a Miyazaki movie, you&amp;rsquo;d expect that it&amp;rsquo;s another well animated movie. Animation &amp;ndash; wise, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say it&amp;rsquo;s his best work I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, but the animation is still noteworthy. The movement was very fluid and the illustrations were all very detailed. It was like watching a Children&amp;rsquo;s water colored story book in motion.<br />
<br />
The music is also very nice. I like both the opening and ending themes, as well as the BGM. Everything was very upbeat and cheerful, definitely something kids would like to hear, but all tracks were very nicely done.<br />
<br />
It&amp;rsquo;s definitely one timeless story that rivals Disney&amp;rsquo;s greatest works. Another must see from the genius known as Hayao Miyazaki.

    It&#039;s often easy to get carried away in the everyday vices and tribulations of life. We often want to reminisce and look back on the better days, full of adventure and enjoyment. Well, this movie does an excellent job of bringing me back to that feeling. It is full of heart-whelming adventure, and exploration.<br />
<br />
I always seem to watch this movie or any Studio Ghibli film for that matter, when I am wanting to experience a child-like sense of adventure. Miyazaki does am excellent job of creating a world, in which you would love to explore and experience. From the stellar landscapes, to the loving Characters,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181141">
        it is all here to enjoy.<br />
<br />
Overall, please watch this move and many more of Miyazaki&#039;s films. They are pure magic.

      Title: My Neighbor Totoro <br />
<br />
Story (9): The movie is about two girls who move to the countryside that meet a giant, cuddly cat named Totoro. The movie starts with them in a car, driving to their new home, and when they get there, they start cleaning and discover great things about the old house. The plot is very interesting, and as the movie goes on, more questions get answered and more start. The story is very amazing and gives you great feel-good vibes as you progress. The studio created a fair amount of mystery and suspense, while all filling the theme of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406588">
        Ghibli film. However, some moments, where the plot isn&#039;t very clear, or some questions don&#039;t get answered. Even though these moments are important to the overall story, they can distract from the main plot itself. Besides that, the movie reveals great detail and features that support the overall story. <br />
<br />
Art (10): I was astonished at how amazing the animating and art are, for a &#039;88 movie. First off, the motion animation was fairly decent and gave a great look to the movie. However, where I am really impressed, is the fact that they gave the art so many details, while all keeping with the fantastic and unique art style.<br />
<br />
Sound (10): The studio made amazing sound effects, that sound realistic and great. The perspective noise was also amazing, and I am very impressed. The voice acting for the dub was awesome.<br />
<br />
Character (10): The introduction to each character was amazing and really felt magical. Each character got fair screen time, and you can really feel their personality as the movie goes on. The character development was also really amazing, and probably the best out of any Ghibli film I have seen. You can really see the depth of the character&#039;s passion as you see them more and more. The movie has a great balance and diversity of characters, and you fall in love with them very fast.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9): This movie really was amazing, and I loved watching it. Some moments in the movies felt a little dragged out, but besides that, this was an amazing feel-good movie, and it was really entertaining to watch. I enjoyed it a lot.<br />
<br />
Overall score: 10/10.

    &quot;Try laughing. Then whatever scares you will surely go away!&quot;<br />
<br />
(WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS!)<br />
<br />
&quot;Tonari No Totoro&quot; is a studio ghibli movie of the 89s, directed by Hayao Miyazaki. At the time of its release, it didn&#039;t was welll-known and neither successful, however some years later, it became a cult of Japan&#039;s anime and movies cinematography, loved by people from all the world, also being considered by Empire one of the best movies ever made.<br />
<br />
Another thing that must be remembered, is that old studio ghibli movies were all handmade, without the use of any technology.<br />
<br />
The plot is pretty simple: A father of two little girls,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406193">
        Satsuki and Mei, will remain for some months in the countryside to be near his wife, who is hospitalized due to a long-term illness, during a summer of the 50s. The movie will show some adorable moments of the family, like eating or taking a bath together, some fights between the two sisters or them playing with the nature. They will also have the fortune to meet some creatures of the forest, like the &quot;susuwatari&quot; spirits, and the kind and super sleepy &quot;Totoro&quot;, who is also the protector of the forest. Thanks to an act of kindness of the older sister Satsuki, Totoro will feel grateful and will reward her and help her and Mei through their hard times.<br />
<br />
I know that this movie has nothing special and I also understand that it can be boring and why some people do not like it, however, in my opinion is its semplicity that make it so special. To me, is the feeling of watching it during a night of a rainy summer or early in the morning, that makes this movie so unforgettable.<br />
<br />
I remember I watched it for the first time in a really depressive period for me, where nothing could calm me down or make me sleep, not even medicines. However, this movie calmed me down almost istantly, it was like it was telling me that everything that afflicted me in that moment would definitely go away, and it made me feel loved and protected, just like a mother&#039;s hug. It really suprised me, and I couldn&#039;t get enough of it, so much that I re-watched it many times whenever I was depressed or simply when I wanted a bit of calm and warmth. Everytime it worked and I never got bored of it.<br />
<br />
I also found a lot of similarities to the place I go every summer. My italian grandparents who llive in Sicily have a really similar house, surrounded by nature and animals of all kinds. I always loved going there but especially when I was a kid, I loved playing with insects who lived there, even though it was full of mosquitoes. I loved going to the vineyard that was there too, eating fresh grapes and pick up natural pine nuts from the road.<br />
Also, there is no internet in there, and I always read and thought a lot in the house&#039;s garden. Even though I do not exactly love my grandparents, we always managed to have fun together and I always felt very calm whenever I went there, a really similar feeling I feel whenever I watch Totoro.<br />
<br />
I also used to play a lot with my older sister when we were little, especially in that house. We would hide, make improvised stupid performances, go with the bicycle through the nature or doing tests of courage at night. One time our grandfather screamed during one of our courage&#039;s tests, and we got so scared that we screamed out loud and then laughed like crazy.<br />
My sister do really resembles Satsuki indeed, a sweet and responsible sister that would do everything for me.<br />
<br />
To me this movie is like a hug or a caress, and will always have a special place in my heart. It always make me remember sweet memories and calm me down, that&#039;s why I will never grow tired of it, and I will watch it even when I&#039;ll grow up.<br />
<br />
All the details, like washing the clothes with the feets, the sweet summer rain and the mosquito nets to sleep without being bitten, are all so realistic and relaxing, and made me remember all of my beloved summers.<br />
<br />
Thank you Miyazaki for making this movie, and thanks Totoro for all the warmth and love you gave me. Even if you&#039;re getting old, I know I would never forget you.<br />
<br />
The capacity of studio ghibli movies of making you love the little things, even the most simple without finding them obvious and making you see their beauty, will always remain a good lesson that I&#039;ll hold deeply in my heart.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading my review and have a great time on mal! &lt;3<br />

    Perfect tens are easy to dismiss, but I assure you I didn&#039;t go into this one expecting it to be so high. <br />
<br />
I missed a lot of these Ghibli movies as a kid, so as an adult going back and checking them out, Totoro was one I knew only by its reputation as the movie with the big cat thing that people make merchandise of. I thought of him as a mascot character like Doraemon less than as a part of a film, and I assumed from the title that he would be a bigger part of the movie than he actually was. Luckily, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397316">
        relationship with Totoro is much less an ET/Stich type of big-unique-animal relationship, and more a way to visualize the kids&#039; budding relationship with nature and spirituality.<br />
<br />
Totaro is by no means inappropriate for children, but it&#039;s a lot more slow and thoughtful than I initially gave it credit for. A lot of time is spent on establishing the house as a real place, details are gone over so carefully that you really sink into the immersive role of these two kids, exploring a new environment through the lens of whimsical innocence. The sound design in particular really stands out; it makes the world feel alive and rich, with sounds of bugs, rustling branches, flowing water, etc. It doesn&#039;t sound like much now, but it&#039;s beautiful to experience. <br />
<br />
The primary source of tension in the story, which I won&#039;t spoil because I think it&#039;s worth going in blind, struck a nerve with me due to personal experience which won&#039;t necessarily carry over to other viewers. The tension created in the third act is really quite intense, even downright stressful. I respect it for knowing exactly how far to go with this, never going so far as to traumatize any young viewers, but not shying away from creating that pit in your stomach when you briefly consider the worst case scenario.<br />
<br />
Even though I didn&#039;t grow up with Totoro, I find it so easy to relate to and so difficult to forget, that it almost feels like I did. It&#039;s a must-see for anyone interested in the Ghibli legacy.

    Tonari no Totoro - Would be one of the best Animes I saw when I saw little.<br />
<br />
Even thought it might been more based towards girls, it still stayed neutral as a soiled stone for both genders.<br />
<br />
The story here is rather simple but still has a very detailed view on things that happens around it, it doesn&#039;t focus just on one thing (like defeat the EVIL monster or find that person) no it goes from 2 girls just moving in with their dad to an adventure with an Creature called Totoro.<br />
<br />
 - Which for a kid were really an inspiration for the beautiful nature we have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34091">
        (even though we don&#039;t really have a cat bus or cool old houses, it still show us how beautiful the surrounding is).<br />
<br />
Even then it doesn&#039;t stop there - It even show us a bit of drama and emotions we as a child could feel (Sadness, anger, disappointed) and not just Happy-go-lucky.<br />
<br />
 The art in the movie for it&#039;s time was actually like looking into the futuristic anime&#039;s we have today.<br />
<br />
The style was really well  (even in VCR it looks amazing) done and almost felt like a dream to watch at.<br />
<br />
The sound here is really, really good structured, you really get to know when stuff happens like something interesting is going on or something sad happen.  <br />
<br />
The Characters in the movie is really interesting but I do think the two sisters were rather overly excited (and the dad) about everything we as a kid were afraid of (at least me), like ghosts, old houses, odd creatures, etc. <br />
But here I would then say it was actually a good thing since it did then bring up some more courage to us that we didn&#039;t have to be afraid of anything.<br />
<br />
As a Child I Enjoyed this movie very much and even today the same movie is now as it was back then but you have now know what all these things were which you didn&#039;t know back then.<br />
<br />
As a recommendation not only to children but to almost anyone out there who likes to take things sometimes back in time and slow.<br />

    My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful telling of child curiosity with some sprinkles of coming of age. It&#039;s surprisingly flat on plot, but I can&#039;t really tell you what I was expecting. I wanted... more, but I don&#039;t know why. It was a perfectly fine film. The story is really cute, the characters are really cute and compelling. It looks amazing, but for some reason, I was expecting Spirited Away. This is nowhere near that. This is the last Miyazaki review I do for a while. Nothing really seems to have the same impact on me as Spirited Away. It&#039;s disappointing.

    What more can be said about My Neighbor Totoro? Get this movie. Immediately. Without a doubt one of the best animated features ever made, Japan or otherwise, Totoro is an outstanding original creation from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s about two sisters -- Satsuki and spunky little Mei -- moving with their somewhat scatterbrained but loving father to a new home in the Japanese countryside. But the place isn&#039;t just deserted; wonders galore lie within their household. Tiny, fuzzy black balls of soot (&amp;quot;Soot Gremlins&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;dust bunnies&amp;quot;, depending on which English version you watch--but more on that later) scatter every nook and cranny of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2976">
        the walls, frightened away only by laughter. A tall, luscious camphor tree towers above the other trees in the back yard.<br />
<br />
And, lastly, the Totoros themselves, absolutely adorable little creatures who look like a cross between a raccoon, rabbit, owl, and guinea pig (a personal bias here, since I owned such a pet who reminds me so much of the Totoros here), live in this very forest, carrying acorns, making huge trees grow at night, and playing ocarinas on the branches of the trees. There is even one really big Totoro who sleeps under the tree, so cuddlesome and gentle that you&#039;ll swear that he&#039;s the equivalent of your pet. Of course, he doesn&#039;t just allow Mei to snuggle on his chest. He lets out thunderous roars, shake the ground by jumping with full force, grins as wide as a Cheshire cat (albeit with warmth and generosity), helps others when they&#039;re in trouble, and gives acorns wrapped in bamboo leaves in return for gifts.<br />
<br />
Arguably the most memorable creation in the movie aside from the Totoros is a giant, ginger-colored cat who takes on the form of a bus, with glowing yellow eyes for the headlights and twelve--count &#039;em, twelve--legs to roam around the countryside faster than the speed of light (I swear, I&#039;m not making this up).  Like Totoro himself, he shares a wide, infectious grin showcasing generosity and warmth.  The Cat Bus only appears two times in the movie, yet every minute we see him in is a delight.<br />
<br />
What gives My Neighbor Totoro its heart is in the characterizations of the girls who propel the story as well as their family and neighbors.  Satsuki and Mei are portrayed as real, believeable children with their strengths and weaknesses.  Satsuki is the older of the two, and at times comes across as bossy, yet she is a sweet, caring young girl and obviously cares for her little sister.  Mei, the youngest, is also the most interesting--bursting with uncontrollable energy and curiosity just like any girl her age would; she constantly demands attention, occasionally competes with her sister, throws fits of frustration, and all around, absolutely adorable.  Their father, who, as mentioned, is a bit of an oddball yet very patient and supportive of his girls, cares for the duo.<br />
<br />
Their next-door neighbor is Granny (Nanny), an equally loving and helpful old woman who comes to help the girls when their father isn&#039;t around.  Her grandson, Kanta, meanwhile, is that typical, impish young boy from everyone&#039;s childhood; he does not know how to deal with girls his age, and initially the best way he can communicate with Satsuki is to tease her, &amp;quot;your house is haunted!&amp;quot;  Naturally, this begins a series of humorous scenes where we see the two of them exchange rude faces at each other.  Later on, however, when Satsuki and Mei are strolling home from school in the rain, Kanta shows by to lend them his umbrella, and even proves to be a true friend, especially during the finale.  Characters as interesting and well defined as this are what makes a movie (or Anime series, TV or OVA) gripping from start to finish, and like most Ghibli movies, My Neighbor Totoro&#039;s cast is the kind that one can identify with or relate to.<br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t all hearts and flowers, however. An emotionally charged subplot involving the sisters&#039; ailing mother (shades of Miyazaki&#039;s personal life here) gives Totoro a dramatic edge. This is particularly evident in the third act, when the girls receive a distressing telegram about their mother. Both Satsuki and Mei are extremely traumatized by this as any real child would be if such a situation occurred in their lifetime.  Mei gets upset and throws a temper tantrum; Satsuki loses patience and lashes out at her sister.  Later Mei sets off for her mother&#039;s hopsital, igniting an intense yet understated climax where Satsuki and everyone else around the neighborhood tries to search for the missing youngster.  Of course, everything turns out happily, but not before these emotionally charged sequences pry tears from the viewer&#039;s eyes. This mixture of real-life situations, emotions, and magical discoveries found in your nearest back yard make Totoro feel authentic (even with its dreamy, childlike fantasy sequences). One cannot help but find this quality in any of Miyazaki&#039;s films, this one included. <br />
<br />
My Neighbor Totoro was not a box office success in either Japan or America, but the film has won over millions of children around the world as well as animation buffs for its gorgeous animation style; the backgrounds are lavishly detailed and imagination is galore in much of the sequences. (It was Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service that would catapult Miyazaki&#039;s animation company, Studio Ghibli, into box office success status.)  As for the musical side of things, Joe Hisaishi supplies a very memorable score which recaptures the childlike innocence and wonder we see in many of the sequences; the theme for Totoro himself is infectiously catchy as is the bouncy march song over the opening credits.  And while it is sparsely used (and sometimes not as grand sounding as his later scores), Hisaishi&#039;s music, whenever we hear it, is a fitting accompaniment to the movie.<br />
<br />
The movie was originally dubbed into English by Carl Macek and his infamous company, Streamline Pictures in 1993. Believe it or not, this was one of the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; dubs they&#039;ve ever produced. As Disney has acquired the rights for Ghibli&#039;s movies, though, it was inevitable that they would produce their own version. This has infuriated many, but as someone who fell in love with Totoro with the Mecak version, I have to say that this new Disney production offers charm and emotion on its own ground.  The script is a fresh new translation from the original Japanese (clarifying the origin of Totoro&#039;s name), and remains faithful to the meaning of Miyazaki&#039;s screenplay, despite a few line changes here and there (nothing major, though).<br />
<br />
At first, I was a little worried about hearing Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, but both ended up captivating me from the start; personally, I think it was great for Disney to cast two actual sisters to play the young girls--it helps their chemistry come alive. The other actors, including a warm, understated Tim Daly, and delightful Lea Salonga provide similarly top quality work. My favorite performances? Pat Carroll, displaying maternal charm and whimsy as Granny (not sounding anything like her most-famous role, Ursula from The Little Mermaid), and Frank Welker, who does outstanding vocal foley for both Totoro and the Cat Bus. The OP and ED songs have the same lyrics, but are sung by a different singer (Sonya Isaacs), who may please some and annoy others. I&#039;m sure that there will be many who will draw comparisons between the two dubs to the very bitter end, but I think it&#039;s great to have more than one adaptation of a beloved story, especially when done by folks who obviously love Miyazaki&#039;s works.<br />
<br />
However you decide to view this film, however, My Neighbor Totoro is far from just another kid&#039;s story. With a little bit of luck, grown-ups (and those who consider themselves too &amp;quot;sophisticated&amp;quot; for cartoons) will enjoy it too.

    My Neighbor Totoro is the flagship of Ghibli and one of the first Japanese animated feature films to receive wide critical acclaim in the west. As much as its successor &#039;Spirited Away&#039; capitalized further in terms of revenue, Totoro stands as one of the most influential anime, with the ubiquitousness of Totoro plushies and pop culture references to it still present today. But there are reasons beyond its success that attributes it as a must watch on the checklist of any avid fan of anime. <br />
<br />
Whether this was your first anime movie as a newcomer, as a kid, or as a moviegoer, none can contest

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194443">
        the brilliance of Miyzaki in developing a world filled with awe and wonder, boundless playfulness and imagination, whilst proficiently capturing the natural innocence and curiosity present in every child, conveying a true sense of realism in the most heartwarming way possible. It&#039;s impossible to come out of Totoro without a big smile of satisfaction while feeling peckish for more Miyazaki. <br />
<br />
I would call Totoro&#039;s aesthetics a marvel considering its time (1988), with the use of tradition cel animation (hand-drawn), adding to the film&#039;s fluidity and polish in the realm of character designs and scenery, altogether toning matrimonially with the &quot;friskiness&quot; the music orchestrates.<br />
<br />
My Neighbor Totoro is not only a visual spectacle, but also encapsulates childhood in a little box. Even as a story tailor-made for kids, older audiences can still identify and project that sense of accomplishment after finding that four leaf clover or discovering an assortment of big acorns under that big tree, long long ago.

    Behind this story of boundless childhood imagination, Miyazaki depicts a child&#039;s ability to process loss and change with great sensitivity. We become acquainted with a cast of friendly creatures that take our protagonists on an adventure brimming with whimsy. <br />
<br />
This intimate depiction of two daughters in a tentative period of their lives is brought to life through the lense of realism and fantasy: A quaint portrayal of two children exploring the rustic landscape they learn to call home. Satsuki and Mei discover the world around them with an astonishing degree of realism: Tantrums, curiosity, unbridled excitement and other unpredictable behaviour make them both relatable and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328405">
        endearing. In tandem with exploring the tangible world, we are invited on a visual and musical spectacle by Totoro and friends on a fantastical journey that encapsulates childhood: A vivid imagination guided by unfiltered curiosity of the world around us. <br />
<br />
Childhood. Quite a short period of our lives given the typical human lifespan, yet it is a period of our most formative years. It is when we are at our most sensitive, when we are the most receptive to external influences of family, society and our environment to eventually become the person that we are today. Ironically, the mind of a child is one that is unshackled by societal restraints, learned prejudices or even the limitations of the physical world. A child pursues the world around it with the same earnest desire to learn, explore and understand. It is a fleeting mentality that becomes moulded by the experiences of growing up. Our childhood is so special and compelling, and yet we tend to remember so little of it with time.<br />
<br />
 In Tonari no Totoro, Miyazaki wrestles with a topic that has perpetuated many works of fiction.  In doing so, he has enraptured the hearts of millions of children, celebrating the ability to dream. And for the ones who have &quot;outgrown&quot; childhood, he brings a touching tale that allows us to relive the ephemeral memories of being a kid again over the course of 86 minutes.<br />
<br />
This is a film that has resonated with me deeply on a personal level, especially the premise of a very ill mother. I have incredibly vivid, detailed memories of that time period that I sometimes wish I didn&#039;t have. I am truly grateful to this film for helping me come to terms with these feelings of half-processed grief, and an incomplete understanding of that period I had as a child that have always stuck with me.<br />

    “A four-year-old child could understand this report….Run out and find me a four-year-old child. I can&#039;t make head or tail out of it.”<br />

Sisters Satsuki and Mei love each other; as affectionate playmates, they grow under their scholarly father’s calm and accepting hand. He doesn’t dismiss their play, nor does he inflate it in the artificial way that adults do; he simply acknowledges their wonder, without rationalizations. The one shadow in this world awash with sunshine is that their mother can’t be with them yet. But Satsuki and Mei are growing up at a time when neighbors still come by to welcome newcomers and lend

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33688">
        a hand, and the neighborhood grandmother is everyone’s grandma.<br />
<br />
At its most lyrical, My Neighbor Totoro shows life as it floats, free and easy, in a stream of happiness. When a sorrow arises, it isn’t out of the blue; it’s an undercurrent running through the highest and lowest undulations of life. It can be answered by the staring, unblinking eyes of the largest and sleepiest of forest spirits. Mei takes to Totoro almost immediately, as a lark knows the morning. Satsuki is thankful for his companionship when she struggles to bear up as the big sister. At the darkest moment, a lithe and grinning cat can transport the frightened children to the tree nearest their longed-for mother. I think that is one of the messages in the after-scenes that accompany the credits: Totoro has magic because Father does finally come home on the last evening bus, and Mother really did just have a cold, and returns to shower Satsuki and Mei with her graces of fellowship and fun. It’s when Father and Mother fail – something as inevitable as death, really – that children develop the quiet and resolved endurance and effort which so enrich the world. But that’s another story, for a later time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Three obligatory comments:<br />
<br />
First, the animation. Satsuki and Mei explore every corner and crevice of their new home; they walk, march, run, and crawl on all fours through sunny rice patches and shaded forests. It’s as if nature itself is infused with a natural joy that never reproaches the children’s fun. Which, of course, it is; and his name is Totoro. <br />
<br />
Second the music. I can’t remember the last time I watched an anime where the music itself was a character; when Satsuki, Mei and Totoro play together in that wonderful scene, the theme is heard in a full-throated orchestral fragment, as if it were “the overflowing of brim-ful gladness.” Feeling lethargic or blue? The opening theme (“Totoro, go, go, go! Energetic! I like walking most”) serves as an animated companion. <br />
<br />
Third, the voice characterizations. The dubbed version with the Fanning sisters sounds interesting. In reality, the universal themes and expressive and thoughtful character designs of My Neighbor Totoro speak for themselves. When the wind beats against the roof, bangs the pots and rattles the doors, the family’s boisterous belly-laughs fill more than the animation – it rolls over into the three dimensional world and straight into the heart. <br />
<br />
Grade: A<br />

    I was down with the flu and I was curled up in my room, looking for something cozy to watch. Flipping through my collection, I suddenly remembered the My Neighbor Totoro DVD I had received as a gift a while back. Needless to say, I popped it into my player, sat back and had one of the most relaxing and peaceful 90 minutes of my life.<br />
<br />
My Neighbor Totoro is hard to synopsize because of the tranquil and laid back first half. I suppose it would suffice to say that this classic 1988 Studio Ghibli movie is about the innocent fun of two little sisters who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34561">
        move into a house in a village, along with their father, only to find out that the picturesque place can be more mysterious than they thought. My Neighbor Totoro has bagged several awards over the years and helped bring Japanese animation into the global spotlight.<br />
<br />
The basic driving force behind the story is this: Don’t you want to be a kid again? Don’t you want to go back to the days when your only responsibilities were to show up at school and be home on time? Don’t you want to look forward to each day, because there was always something new to learn, find and discover? This universal, yet eternally successful theme is what made My Neighbor Totoro click. The story is so beautifully crafted that kids look at this movie as the adventures of two sisters, while adults while adults perceive this anime to be a timeless classic that will forever remind them of their innocent childhood.<br />
<br />
Another positive aspect of the story is that it’s character driven, but not in the traditional sense. Instead of developing the characters or making them take on hard decisions, this movie’s characters are the diamonds in the rough because of their simple and lifelike charms. They think, act and behave just like any curious and energetic children of their age would. The two sisters, Satsuki and Mei, are sure to inspire kids and bowl over adults with their sweet and loveable attitudes. The seiyu also deserve a lot of credit here, because they bring out all the energy and emotions necessary for their roles.<br />
<br />
 If you were wondering why I didn’t make a mention of Totoro, the giant chubby ferret/forest spirit, it’s because he is (in my opinion at least) present for appealing to the kids and doesn’t really play an important role otherwise. A contributor to the entertainment (and cuteness, if you like) factor.<br />
<br />
I got my hands on a re-mastered DVD edition of this one, so I won’t be able to judge the quality of the original theatrical/VHS version. Still, you can’t make a good sculpture without good clay, so I think it’s safe to say that the art was outstanding. The backgrounds were very neat and looked exactly like a 1950s Japanese village. Characters were drawn in trademark Ghibli style, which is never a bad thing. A perfect ten.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack added to the straightforward atmosphere of the show. Nothing fancy, just the good old piano. The OP, Stroll, was a nice upbeat song that reminded me of The Sound of Music, especially the English version.<br />
<br />
This anime would get a sure ten from any kid who’s below 10, but looking at it from a more mature perspective, My Neighbor Totoro does have some minor issues which deny it the perfect score. Because of its age, it is rather predictable and I felt the mood swing from the lax and serene atmosphere from the first half to the more fast paced and fantastical approach to the second half was a little unnecessary. The fantasy aspect is played around with to please kids, but older viewers might not approve. The dialogue and script could’ve been a tad tighter too. But that’s about all the flaws I can come up with, after a lot of time I spent on nitpicking.<br />
<br />
Regardless of whether you’re a kid, adult, otaku, casual viewer or just plain bored, My Neighbor Totoro is most certainly worth your time. <br />
<br />
[  THE WRAP-UP ]<br />
My Neighbor Totoro is a landmark anime that garnered critical appeal and international fandom. Although primarily intended for children, this 90 minute movie is bound to appeal to the taste buds of anyone, even if they’re not a big fan of anime. The story is uncomplicated and easy to watch, which is always a good thing if you’re looking for something nice and comfy. The undeniable charm of the characters also adds to the realistic atmosphere of this Studio Ghbili movie. Despite its release date, the animation is solid, just like the fitting soundtrack. My Neighbor Totoro is an anime that gained mainstreamed recognition and popularity for good reason. In other words, watch it. <br />

    Still a total masterpiece. It feels so old but it’s so well made. It has a simple story of confidence and resistance all wrapped in the connection to the world we go through. The world-building is so realistic and purposeful. The way how they interact with the worlds of humans, forest and spirits is super effective and immersive. It creates a memorable environment that flows to the narrative in such a great way. The characters are absolutely perfect and the growth they go through is really wonderful. Miyazaki’s appreciation of the unclouded judgement of children is exemplified well here, and it feels definitely like a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346067">
        practice to what would happen in Spirited Away. They’re both sensitive young girls who have to trust but at the same time still fear the world they move into. Combined with their mother’s illness it’s a challenging world in both their concern but it’s so empowering and heartwarming to see them surpass it and live in these times. I relate a lot to Satsuki in how she seeks to survive and support the lives of her family in her mother’s absence. And her sense of control is quite strong but the fragility underneath is very believable and beautiful. The spiritual aspects of this film is fantastic in how they’re used. The build up with Totoro’s influence and how the characters grow is perfectly balanced. Their trust of connecting and appreciation of the world they live is payed off in a beautiful poetic way. With Satsuki giving Totoro the umbrella paying off with him helping her find Mei in the end. It’s such an interesting world but it’s such a great message of confidence and hope. The ways that the actual spirits are portrayed is also really cool. With only the girls seeing them at select times and subtle hints that everyone has seen them before strengthens the belief that they are in fact real. The adult’s belief in spiritual is also really cool. In other films adults may brush off and say that they aren’t real but in this film everyone wants to connect and feel safe in this world so they wouldn’t they deny it. And Totoro’s design is so perfectly cute and weird. A character that would only ever make sense in animation or else it would look terrifying. And the little ones are adorable. I watched the Japanese dub and honestly, it’s kind of rubbish? Like especially with the Dad and Nanny, they can’t really quite capture a certain suspense for the moment and it feels super weird. In the English one they have great personality and emotional nuances that also feel real and it’s epic. Also the joke where Satsuki just says she drew Mei as a crab wasn’t in the original and it’s a bit bland in the Japanese version. But yeah this movie is perfect and I love it dearly.

    Tonari no Totoro was one of my first exposures to anime, when I was but a young lad of 5 my eldest sister sat me down and watched it with me. at such a young age, I was enthralled by everything, the fuzzy looking art, the beautiful backgrounds and probably my favourite aspect of the film to this day, the music. <br />
<br />
Joe Hasaishi&#039;s score is brilliant, the main theme, Kaze no Torimichi, whilst not being my favourite Ghibli theme, is excellent, and still gives me goosebumps when I listen.<br />
<br />
Before I decided to write this review, I rewatched the film to make sure I wasn&#039;t just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409422">
        having fond memories due to nostalgia, this however, was not the case and the film still holds up to this day. <br />
<br />
Because it was so instrumental in my discovery and subsequent enjoyment of anime as a whole and all the other points discussed, I can rate this film a 10/10 in confidence.

    Sigh...How should I describe my most cherished and precious childhood memory of my whole life so that I wouldn&#039;t understate it at all?!?!<br />
<br />
After all, Tonari no Totoro is the first anime and probably even the first full-length film I ever saw. It is the key that opened the first door towards the wonderful world of anime, manga and the whole japanese culture itself. I&#039;m not such a type that has certain idols/authorities behind my ideologies but if there&#039;s one, it is definitely Hayao Miyazaki.<br />
<br />
When I try to explain to someone how incredible this movie is, I almost can&#039;t put it in understandable words (like even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10657">
        now). With an innocent, simple and pure storyline, Studio Ghiblis outstanding animation, Joe Hisaishis B E A U T I F U L music and imaginative characters like makkuro kurosukes, you get an experience that takes away all your troubles and sorrow and turns you from the beginning till the ending of credits into a full 100% optimistic person. It may not be exactly like that (for me it was), but I can assure, that after you have seen this movie, you are NOT disappointed.<br />
<br />
PS warning: The opening theme will make you feel like you&#039;re a 4 year old again!

    My Neighbor Totoro is a weird movie. It&#039;s also one of Hayao Miyazaki&#039;s first directorial works as well as his first film with Studio Ghibli. Totoro is often cited as classic anime, but is it really any good? It&#039;s hard for me to say; I&#039;m not a big fan of Miyazaki or family movies. It&#039;s a bit melodramatic, though some people would rephrase it as touching. It&#039;s hard to relate to the main characters because they&#039;re so annoying! They seem to yell all the time. My Neighbor Totoro also has Miyazaki&#039;s signiture trippy scenes, such as Totoro with the umbrella and the catbus. While I
