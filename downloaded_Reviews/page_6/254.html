    “¡ One for all, hole in one!” —Nadeshiko Kagamihara<br />
<br />
Yuru Camp is one of the gems from the season. Who could have guessed a camping series would be fun, refreshing, and very entertaining? Also, no matter how you are feeling, after each episode you will end with a big smile on your face. Yuru Camp isn’t about cute girls doing cute things. It is about how to enjoy simpler situations and how to maintain the proper mood and be happy under any circumstance. More important, the series irradiates that sensation to all the spectators. These girls give us a funny and delightful gem and will stay

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274533">
        in our memories for a long time.<br />
<br />
The story is straightforward and easy to follow, it is fun, fresh and entertaining to watch. It focuses on camping. Yes, I envision the same thing you’re thinking: camping, are you kidding me? How can you have a plotline about camping? It must be a fiasco. However, Yuri Camp is not dull, from a common event like camping, the authors create an amusing narration where all the characters take pleasure in camping. Keep in mind that maybe you want to go camping with your friends after the series because the characters’ commitment is plausible, delightful and absorbing. The message given to the audience through the story’s simplicity is enjoying the moments of life.<br />
<br />
As a starting point, the pacing is perfect, and the way how all the characters are involved is pretty clever. It is remarkable seeing the correlation and the chemistry between them, no matter if they appear in the scene for few seconds, their actions complement the setting, and you don’t feel them wasted. Every character has a different personality that boosts the dynamic through the storyline and embodies the meaning of friendship. Another notable aspect, the trust. Would you camp with someone you do not trust? The series enrich the plot with those values and propels them in each episode. For example, Rin likes camping alone, but she starts enjoying her time with Nadeshiko and considers her as a friend. Since they are a group of “buddies,” they share their tastes (food, hobbies, fun). Also, the story maintains the realism and gives tips about camping. This small world is full of comical events and funny jokes executed at the perfect moment ingeniously. Look Nadeshiko, she may seem to be childish, yet she is very energetic, and she uses that side of her personality to be humorous. Just with her behavior, the characters seem flashy and feel happy. All this is possible because the authors care about the pacing and the story.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, some spectators believe the series doesn’t have a plot, so they consider the show boring. The simplicity of the narrative can be measured in the course of action and the mood while camping. How many of us have at least camping once in our lives? If it was a gratifying experience then this show will bring memories and forgotten desires, perhaps you could end remembering some of your old friends. This series demonstrates that every action, no matter how insignificant is, it would make our existence happier and enjoyable. For me, seeing how these characters admire a landscape, it is very remarkable. Maybe it is a cliché, but that easiness is what we call having a good time. Lastly, I have not found any negative aspect of the show. Nothing is perfect, yet the anime covers some basic ideas such as friendship, trust, passion, joy, and boosts them in a very entertaining way. Yuri Camp’s beauty lies in its simplicity.<br />
<br />
We have five characters in the story. The most noticeable Is Nadeshiko because she is the one that which gathers the rest of the cast together, and she is the central point for most of the jokes. Nadeshiko is very energetic and blissful. She loves eating, and we can consider her a thrilled girl. The other main character, Rin. In the beginning, she enjoys camping alone, but Nadeshiko’s influence may change her. Rin has more camping experience than the others.<br />
The remaining characters add fluency to the story. Aoi and Chiaki, they are the members of the Outdoor Activities Club. Thanks to Nadeshiko the club continues with the activities and start to plan camping meetings. Lastly Ena, she always mocks Rin. Something I notice is the lack of a detailed background, but the plot works very well without it. You only need to know they like camping and the rest will come from their personalities.<br />
<br />
The art and sound are good. One exciting part is how they care about the landscapes. It is a plus because most of the scenes are outside. The camera angles and the camera movement focus on the main characters. Also, the color palette is very vivid and catch the attention of your eyes. However, the character’s design is standard compared with other series; it goes well with the simplicity of the plot. Regarding the sound, the score fills the moments and the jokes. It isn’t bad. Although, sometimes you don’t notice it because it is standard. <br />
<br />
The OP and ED are great. I love those two songs. The lyrics and the rhythm work very well and are very catchy. Honestly, I hummed the OP for a whole day. I am getting crazy. =( <br />
<br />
Finally, the combination between a simple and a fluid narrative, good characters, attractive art design, right sound, creates a delightful story called Yuru Camp. I like the show, I want a second season but maybe isn’t going to happen, yet it was a hilarious ride. You must give this anime an opportunity.  <br />

    Another edition to the endlessly growing roster of “cute girls doing cute things” anime.  I definitely know a certain SOMEONE who would love this show. <br />
<br />
So what is Yuru Camp△? (Yes, you have to have the little tent). In English, the title is “Laid Back” Camp, and that honestly couldn’t be more appropriate. It’s about a group of girls that form a camping club at their school, and spend their breaks doing just that; camping. There’s relaxing atmosphere, friendly humor, and tranquility. <br />
<br />
So, being that it’s this kind of Slice of Life, the story certainly means to be casually presented. It’s a ripe candidate

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274562">
        for those days where you do nothing but sit back, eat snacks, and refuse to care about anything else for at least 24 minutes of runtime (288 if you just watch the whole thing in one go, which is acceptable to me, being only a 12 episode show). <br />
<br />
That’s not to say the show is bad, I really don’t think that—but if you wanted something profound, look elsewhere. Yuru Camp△ is a show for the people who appreciate calm, happy presentations of friendship, hobby exploration, and overall contentment. There’s nothing but smiles to be had, but it does it in a way that is neither over the top nor painful. We can find joy in how smoothly the anime incorporates naturalistic imagery alongside comfortable music and some pretty adorable characters. <br />
<br />
Despite that, the characters in the show are completely defined by their love of camping and their girlish charm. Again, I just cannot stress enough that this story is not trying to be anything more. They don’t need to be deeply complex for this type of thing; they serve the experience well enough with just having well-defined archetypes. Still, while I wouldn’t call this a detractor, it’s scoring no points—it breaks even. The story has little going for it other than the demeanor with which it&#039;s shown... they camp. That&#039;s honestly, really all it is. <br />
<br />
The animation is honestly wonderful, though. The colors are defined and the motion flows so much better than a lot of other shows that you’d be entirely forgiven for coming to Yuru Camp△ for how it looks and the way it makes you feel. You definitely won&#039;t find much else.<br />
<br />
PROS:<br />
-	Consistently relaxing atmosphere. <br />
-	Camping tips and knowledge are pretty prevalent throughout, to the point where I learned a few things I didn’t know before, and was appreciative that they had been taught to me through a decently entertaining show. <br />
-	I can’t honestly say it’s really boring, parts of the show did make me chuckle at times and I appreciated the camaraderie amongst the characters.<br />
-	WOW that opening. And ending. The music in this show is phenomenal, as is the animation.<br />
<br />
MIXED: <br />
-	It does nothing new, yet does nothing wrong. It loses no money, yet makes no money. In business we call this “breaking even.” <br />
-	Hardly more emotions to be found other than pure joy and quiet peace. Also, some silliness here and there.<br />
-	It’s pretty much unspoilable. You can take this in two ways – one, that the show has no story; or two, the show presents a “unique” type of story. Both are acceptable descriptors. <br />
<br />
CONS:<br />
-	This is yet another one of those shows where cute girls do cute things, and it seems like they only exist for the explicit reason of camping every week. There’s no depth to be seen, and while I didn&#039;t hate them, being archetypes is nothing to celebrate. <br />
-	Sometimes the series watches like an advertisement for various products and campsites around Japan, and honestly, I expect that this is exactly what it is. <br />
<br />
Upon writing this review, I discovered that this anime is based on a manga, and I couldn’t be less surprised. According to my Japanese friends, who I’ve spoken to about anime and manga quite extensively, manga is pretty damn popular in Japan, and there are manga for virtually everything and everyone. So it comes to me as no surprise that there’s a manga exclusively about real camping locations, ways to camp there, and little else other than cute girls—it would be something that a bunch of kids pick up at the market on the way to their OWN camping trip to read before they snooze off or right after dinner. Simple, inoffensive, and quite adorable at times. <br />
<br />
But is it any more? <br />
<br />
I don’t think so. <br />
 <br />

    I think that sometimes, to relax, we need to explore other unusual places, almost exotic, to realize how the nature around us is so exceptional. That&#039;s what Yuru Camp is trying to demonstrate. We don&#039;t always need awesome things like explosions, magic powers to make an interesting show. <br />
<br />
Story: Yuru Camp focuses on a theme: camping. We follow the daily life of Shima Rin (nicknamed Shimarin) who goes camping regularly on her days off. She meets the happy Nadeshiko who knows nothing about camping. After a little conversation and a delicious dinner in front of the incredible Mount Fuji, Nadeshiko develops a taste for camping.<br />
<br />
Those

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274553">
        two girls attend the same high school. Nadeshiko also meets Aoi and Chiaki, two girls who formed the camping club. The latter is not so successful and has little budget. As for Shimarin, she prefers to go camping alone. <br />
<br />
This is how the girls of the club will progressively be prepared for their adventure. Buy the equipment, the food necessary to spend a night in the mountains. Since we are in a cold period of the year, they also make sure they have the means to warm up. This is not always easy since the club doesn&#039;t have a lot of budget and must be satisfied with their tent costing 980 yen.<br />
It&#039;s fun to see what means they will use to do their first camping. The anime does a great job explaining in detail the different types of existing materials and the tasty dishes to cook when we go camping. it is really trying to convey to us the passion of its characters for camping. I honestly understand why Nadeshiko and her friends are so motivated.<br />
<br />
Shimarin travels alone (over hundreds of kilometers) to discover the sublime landscapes and peaceful places in the prefecture. The girls will make a lot of use of the instant messaging system. Each of them will send a photo to show her the places she visited or banalities. This is how the relationship between characters will progress (especially between Shimarin and Nadeshiko) and finally allow them to go together all together, later in the series.<br />
<br />
The relationship is essentially based on the unsaid. We feel that Shimarin is someone who is used to being alone, whether in high school or camping. Her chance meeting with Nadeshiko will change things and allow her to share her passion with other friends of the same age.<br />
Sometimes she doesn&#039;t seem disinterested enough (except when she sees dogs) but in her heart, she really wants to have a good time with her new friends. For example, when Aoi will propose to go camping together. She refuses at first even if we can perceive a touch of regret in her words. Shimarin is usually mature, calm and resourceful.<br />
At the exact opposite, Nadeshiko behaves like a child (although she uses some old expressions) but she is sociable and always ready to go on an adventure with her friends.<br />
<br />
On the technical aspects, the landscapes are absolutely sublime, really. They would be ideal for wallpapers. These different places impressed me and I was fascinated by their realistic appearance. C-station studio isn&#039;t known to me but I will remember that excellent work. We can notice the use of CGI when Shimarin drives his moped.<br />
The vocal performances perfectly transpose the personality of our characters. Nadeshiko has an often playful voice, while Shimarin has a duller voice. The opening theme &quot;Shiny Days&quot; is catchy and the ending matches the relaxed atmosphere of the series.<br />
The soundtrack is one of the highlights of the series. It is reminiscent of Celtic folk music. Tateyama Akiyuki has really captured this peaceful atmosphere with his OST. Honestly, it&#039;s a delight, and I can&#039;t wait to listen to them in a flac version. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, the series has clearly exceeded my expectations. It is an excellent iyashikei with a relaxing autumn/winter atmosphere in Yamanashi that will make you smile regularly. The friendship between our cute characters is touching. Laid-back Camp is a success.

    The sun is setting. The cold breezes that brushed through the yellow-green grass just a few minutes earlier have left the plains. In front of a small camping tent, Rin is comfortably seated in a folding chair, reading a book. A while has passed and she decides to put down her warm cup of cocoa, close her book and stretch; a puff of breath turns into a small cloud and slowly fades away. She looks at her surroundings: a huge, empty field of grass, a small forest and a clear view of a Mt. Fuji tinted in a friendly pink. Rin is on another of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274544">
        her lonesome weekendly winter camping trips. During the coldest season, she fancies spending some time alone in the quiet areas of Japan—on camping sites usually uncrowded during the winter. <br />
<br />
During her trips, she spends a lot of time exploring the camping grounds; in midst of beautifully drawn, colorful sceneries, she follows intricately painted pathways in search for the stunning sights of an everyday beauty of nature perfectly evoked by the show’s wonderful visuals. Whether she ends up exploring the campsites, the colorful forests of early winter, taking pictures of funny-looking statues or just sitting in her chair relaxing, it doesn’t really matter; she just wants to spend some time on her own enjoying nature. Apart from camping, she doesn’t have any predominant interests or hobbies, and while she does truly love her friends and enjoys spending time with them, this pastime is something she truly needs: a breather, so to speak.<br />
<br />
It comes as no surprise when she turns down an invitation to join her school’s camping club; it’d go against the purpose of her camping trips. And really, that’s completely okay. Her friends understand. While they may not truly grasp her feelings, they respect her desire to camp on her own without pressing further. This comes as kind of a surprise initially: in general, the members of the camping club are very energetic and gung-ho; seeing these characters which one might initially pass off as everyday anime idiots act like sensitive, genuine human beings and friends is truly, truly refreshing. Rin and them couldn’t be more different: Chiaki and Aoi often indulge in weird jokes or pranks, and while their love for camping is definitely genuine, so is their aversion to spending even a single penny on actually acquiring necessary utensils. Nadeshiko on the other hand is very much a simpleton—a hyperactive, hyperhappy and hyperhungry simpleton. It’s not only the members of the camping club who differ from Rin (whose camping trips aren’t as quiet and calming as Rin’s); the three horse around and have fun. Instead of appreciating the quiet and nature, they just want to spend time and camp together as a group of friends.<br />
<br />
Due to the cast and the camping trips covering such a wide spectrum, the otherwise rather monotonous-sounding activity of winter camping can offer a variety of different, but always pleasant and comfy experiences. And while Rin and her friends may be apart when camping (well, most of the time), they are never out of touch: during their camping trips they regularly message or call each other and send the others photos of the camping sites they visit. They indulge in mindless but fun chats about food or the weather and it feels completely genuine. But not only do these small chats serve to make the character’s relationships feel real, they also help the otherwise standalone camping trip segments connect to the rest of the show to form a cohesive whole; while the general moods of Rin’s camping trips and the camping club horsing around are completely different, they still feel like parts of the same show, not fragments of a greater whole.<br />
<br />
It isn’t just these small conversations between the group and Rin that creates the feeling of unity between every single scene. Yuru Camp’s soundtrack consists of very few songs which, while usually a negative, works well for what the show is trying to accomplish. The tracks are all very simple, but they sell their respective scenes perfectly through equally simple means: a short, repeated trill in the lead guitar is enough to sell the relaxing camping atmosphere; a change from a dominant guitar to flutes can be mystifying and create a sense of exploration; and a calm vocal song is enough to sell the most intimate of togetherness. It won’t earn any medals or prizes, but the soundtrack does just what it’s supposed to, and that’s just what you want for an equally simple and relaxing show such as Yuru Camp.<br />
<br />
Be it Rin’s appreciation for the quiet and nature, the lively and fun friendship of the camping club or their genuine and heartwarming relationships—there is much to love in this soothing show. Yuru Camp may seldom stray off the beaten path, but it doesn’t need to, for it is a comfy and lighthearted experience through and through.<br />
<br />
However, if you decide to join in on the fun please keep in mind that while camping…<br />
<br />
- Always mind the campsite and facility rules<br />
- Don’t forget to clean up fires and take your trash!<br />
- It gets cold during the winter. Stay warm and be well-prepared!!<br />
- Have fun :)<br />
<br />
Score: 75<br />

    Sit back, relax, and gaze upon the glory that is Yuru Camp.<br />
<br />
Tbh I never expected to enjoy a series this much. With all the anime going on on a Thursday, this is definitely a great way to end it. The first episode already captivated me with its amazing soundtrack, character design, and background art.<br />
<br />
Our main character Rin, is someone who enjoys camping alone, we see that in episode 1. She&#039;s someone who would rather enjoy camping at her own leisure. However, because there are more amazing characters, she soon starts to meet them as well as open up to them more and becomes more social.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269697">
        I appreciate these character interactions because it&#039;s so humanlike and it&#039;s super sweet and all of them have chemistry with each other.<br />
<br />
And it ain&#039;t just the characters themselves, the background art and colours are super attractive and really compliments the anime very well. There&#039;s also the fact that the background art and amazing colours are accompanied by the AMAZING OST. Each soundtrack piece really sets the vibe for each episode and each event that happens within Yuru Camp. Not to mention that GODLIKE OP. I&#039;ve never heard such a catchier op than this one this season.<br />
<br />
Also, apparently the campsites the girls&#039; go to camp at are actually based on actual locations. I saw a few pictures of it in its real life form and it really looks exactly as the anime shows. It&#039;s amazing that these beautiful sites are real places to camp.<br />
<br />
So in short:<br />
<br />
Story (8) - Very Simple, Rin who loves to camps meets a new girl who eventually befriends her and enjoys camping along with her in due time. Then more girls show up and then they&#039;ll all camp together. A simple yet very well executed story that hits every note right.<br />
<br />
Art (9) - Each character looks unique and the colours are well used.<br />
<br />
Sound (10) - Easily one of the best OST&#039;s I&#039;ve heard and the appropriate timings used of these songs really makes the anime all the better.<br />
<br />
Character (10) - Each girl carries a beautiful and amazing personality and shows as well as reminds us how cute the CGDCT genre can be. Each girl is lovable and will not disappoint in putting a smile on your face.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10) - I&#039;ve enjoyed each second that Yuru Camp has to offer. I&#039;ve never got bored of this anime and it was beautiful.<br />
<br />
Overall (9) - If the goal of this anime was to give you a big smile and show you how girls can camp extremely well, then it does that very well. What can I say, it does everything right in terms of enjoyment, character, soundtracks, and beautiful art.<br />
<br />
Yuru Camp will always be the anime to end my Thursdays. Now if you&#039;ll excuse me, I need some Ramen.<br />

    If the only purpose of Yuru Camp was to create a very cute, shallow, flavor of the week moe show, then they’ve succeeded brilliantly. If it attempted to be something more than that, it failed brilliantly.<br />
<br />
Story(3): Like most cute girls doing cute things shows, this show has little to offer in the way of story. This is a character driven show about a group of girls making friends and messing around in their club. There’s hardly any conflict at all, the girls simply go about their lives. <br />
<br />
Art(6): The character designs do a great job of selling of cutsey part of the show, and do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272448">
        a good job clueing us on their personalities, as one dimensional as they may be. The pink hair girl has to be one of the most satisfying cute girl character designs I’ve seen in a while. I can’t say I remember the backgrounds being particularly notable, though, even in the parts where they are attempting to show off Mount Fuji. The animation isn’t anything special either.<br />
<br />
Characters(2): A cute girls doing cute things show doesn’t always need to have a plot. They survive and die on the strength of their characters personalities and their relationships with each other. This is where the show really falls short. Each character could easily be summed up in one sentence. When they are put into situations, they interact in the most cliché and predictable ways possible. They’re not just laid back, they’re boring.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(3): Because of the lack of thought or effort put into these characters, I found myself getting bored half way through the first episode. I pushed through a couple more because the MAL score here was so far, hoping it got better. It didn’t, only adding more on dimensional characters that the show failed to make me care about.<br />

    “Riiiin-chaaaaaaaan~!” - Nadeshiko Kagamihara<br />
<br />
🥇 9/10<br />
After a long tiring week of school or work, maybe a getaway is something you need. How about camping? Traveling and exploring somewhere far from the city is actually not a bad idea. Yuru Camp△ is probably one of the most relaxing anime you can find, giving audiences traveling and camping experience, which takes place in Yamanashi and its nearby prefectures, where one of the most popular landmarks in Japan, Mount Fuji, is visible, and of course with cute high school girls. After a show completion, you might want to pack your bag and try going on camping at least once

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337543">
        in a lifetime.<br />
<br />
🎬 Story - 8/10<br />
Rin Shima, nicknamed Shimarin, while on her usual camping, she met Nadeshiko Kagamihara who has just moved to Yamanashi, that is how the story starts. Yuru Camp△ offers audiences a unique theme, camping. The story is mainly about high school girls go traveling and camping around Yamanashi and its nearby prefectures.<br />
<br />
Personally, I love the idea of storytelling that focuses on sightseeing and camping places, making Yuru Camp△ sometimes give off a vibe of a travel show with cute girls as the show hosts. Furthermore, with a camping-focused story, audiences are able to learn and experience things that campers do, like choosing a place to camp, traveling, or choosing and buying different types of camping gear.<br />
<br />
The story itself has no actual weak points, but the potential to be better. It would be awesome if the story actually has a big goal and be a bit more character-focused. Overall, Yuru Camp△ offers a great, feel-good, and very relaxing experience. In addition, this show also includes comedic moments which will surely make you smile.<br />
<br />
🎨 Animation - 8/10<br />
The overall art quality is above standard, pretty much high quality. The art itself is considered to be eye-friendly, composed of low-saturated colors on both scenery and characters. The art of sceneries is excellent, very much detailed and realistic. Since the show is mainly about camping around Yamanashi and its nearby prefectures, by referencing real places, having it more realistic is a correct choice, matching the mood and tone of the anime. In addition, foods in Yuru Camp△ looks delicious.<br />
<br />
🔈 Sound - 10/10<br />
Yuru Camp△ is probably one of the anime having the most relaxing soundtracks ever. During my 12-episode watch, soundtracks never failed to amaze me, being able to make me noticed almost all of them. They are surely the main source of such a relaxing vibe of this show.<br />
<br />
Soundtracks are mostly composed of the sound of an acoustic guitar, an ideal musical instrument to perform on the campfire site, and also a woodwind instrument, probably a flute. Overall wise choice of choosing music instruments in creating such relaxing soundtracks, matching the nature and camping theme.<br />
<br />
Yuru Camp△ also has a nice opening song and a very relaxing ending song, it is recommended not to skip them, try listening to them at least once, you will surely love them.<br />
<br />
🕶 Characters - 8/10<br />
Yuru Camp△’s main characters consist of 5 high school girls, Rin, Nadeshiko, Aoi, Chiaki, and Ena. The characters are very well-created, surprisingly cute, they can be even better with more stories and details.<br />
<br />
Starting with the character design, overall pretty great and cute, despite the characters are having fancy hair colors, having low-saturated colors creates a perfect balance of fanciness and plainness.<br />
<br />
Each character has their own unique traits and personality. While Nadeshiko is cheerful and energetic-type, Rin is a quiet-type. Despite her quietness, she is also shown to show her cute side on several occasions. It is interesting to see characters with a personality opposite to each other become friends, I love it when Nadeshiko is yelling for Rin. Aoi is a calm-type, loves to trick her friends with a made-up story while making a cheeky face, not to mention that her Kansai dialect is surprisingly cute and charming. Chiaki and Ena also have their own unique traits and personality, I do not find them to be standing out, but they are surely important to the show.<br />
<br />
The friendship between characters is shown to develop throughout the series, the most noticeable one would probably be one of Rin and Nadeshiko. From the first episode to the end of the series, most of the main characters and club itself show some minor developments. I love how character development can work out in an anime of this genre.<br />
<br />
However, what characters lack is their individual story. Almost no background is told about them. The story covers only a brief of their personal life besides camping, including their time with family and a part-time job. They are needed more. As mentioned in the story section, having a more character-focused story would benefit not only the story but also the characters.<br />
<br />
🎉 Enjoyment - 9/10<br />
I am not really a fan of slice of life anime, but Yuru Camp△ is surprisingly good, a perfect combination of a slice of life and comedy. Since Yuru Camp△ is considered to be a show of “cute girls doing cute things”, a show this type needs well-created characters, and Yuru Camp△ did it well.<br />
<br />
As a person who loves traveling in Japan, I enjoyed this anime even not being a fan of this genre. The theme is also unique, making it much far interesting from other slice of life anime. While Yuru Camp△ may seem incomplete, but from what Yuru Camp△ has to offer is already amazing. Most importantly, Yuru Camp△ has such magnificent and relaxing soundtracks, becoming the most relaxing anime I have ever watched. In the end, I am pretty impressed.<br />
<br />
📌 Recommendations<br />
If you are looking for a unique slice of life anime, a relaxing anime, or anime about the journey, then Yuru Camp△ is a show you should never miss. Enjoy!

    This is my first review of an anime I&#039;ve made for quite a long time, so please bear with me.  Personally, I&#039;m a big fan of slice-of-life shows like Yuru Yuri, Non Non Biyori, Sound! Euphonium, etc., and I&#039;ve watched them ever since I&#039;ve watched Azumanga Daioh, which was originally released back in 2002.  But Yuru Camp, aka Laid-Back Camp, is easily one of the most relaxing, laid-back anime I&#039;ve watched along with Non Non Biyori.  Yuru Camp is perfect to make me forget about all my worries in the world momentarily.<br />
<br />
Yuru Camp may be just a typical slice-of-life anime at first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review352669">
        glance, but the characters are what separates this anime from other slice-of-life anime, and how cute they are.  It&#039;s cute girls going camping, and who doesn&#039;t love them?  Yuru Camp did not have much of the plotline, but it did have some character development.  We get to see Rin, who&#039;s experienced in solo camping, has become more open to camp with her friends.  Plus, the campers have recruited a young girl to the guild!  Otherwise, the anime mainly just show a lot of mischievous camping fun between high school girls, and the narrator, voiced by Akio Otsuka, even teaches the viewers some helpful camping tips!<br />
<br />
The characters are all unique, and they are all pretty likable.  Rin is a confident, relatable girl who likes to be alone but doesn&#039;t mind being friends with other girls. Nadeshiko is a ditzy, energetic girl who likes to eat a lot, and she has made some of the cutest facial expressions I&#039;ve ever seen.  Her Tareme eyes has already made herself cute, and I really like her energetic personality.  Aoi is a very nice girl who has a cute little fang, and Chiaki is the tomboy with glasses along with her fiesty personality.  My favorite character of the show is Ena, who&#039;s Rin&#039;s best friend, and she&#039;s voiced by one of my top favorite seiyuus, Rie Takahashi.  Her voice is so soothing, and I really wish she would get more screen time.  The voice acting in general is well done, with Nao Touyama being the other standout by making Rin such a cool character.<br />
<br />
Overall, Yuru Camp is an incredible anime that gives its maximum comfiness to viewers like me.  Being a slice-of-life moe anime, it was odd that there was not really any downtime in the series, but maybe the &quot;downtime&quot; was all the cute scenes and I was so happy that I didn&#039;t really have to care about my viewing experience.  I am very excited for Season 2 of Yuru Camp in 2021, and I really hope that this anime will be dubbed in English if possible.  This anime is easily one of my favorite slice-of-life anime I&#039;ve watched, and I highly recommend watching Yuru Camp to slice-of-life fans.  You won&#039;t regret it, and it might even inspire you to go out camping like many people after watching the anime.

    Yuru Camp was a strange phenomenon to witness. An anime produced by a newish studio and an inexperienced staff, with a premise that looked about as basic and niche as it could, adapting a fairly unknown manga. Very few people looked forward to this show, and I was certainly not one of them as it didn&#039;t look particularly appealing at first.<br />
<br />
And yet, it remains as the third highest-rated non-sequel show of its season, only behind two series that rely on more visceral and spectacular storytelling (Sora yori mo tooi basho and Violet Evergarden), with heavier themes and mood shifts. It is one of the best-selling

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278268">
        shows of the season as well, increasing manga sales, selling a lot of merchandise and, as of today, tripling the amount of visitors to the campsites located at the Yamanashi Prefecture the series focuses on.<br />
<br />
The thing is, Yuru Camp is a show about camping. And not even about camping as a side element or room for more potentially exciting character quirks. About camping in itself as an experience, with a cast of characters that develop an interest and are always looking forward to, and grow, and set their focus on the activity. For twelve episodes. With no tension, no character drama, no external elements getting in the way and certainly not a sense of danger or heavy uncertainty. It is strict in what it covers and straightforward in what it wants to evoke.<br />
<br />
In a way, that was an advantage to the show. Week after week, this was a safe choice with a clear attached mood that people could get into knowing what they&#039;d expect and the exact kind of reaction they&#039;d get from it. Some people probably didn&#039;t like it, but they weren&#039;t vocal: it&#039;s not the kind of show that can lead to visceral hate. Not having any element that could generate controversy, it was only natural that the series grew through the season with very little negativity around it. The scenario for this backfiring was also clear: after all, what kind of appeal does this harmless fun provide compared with the more spectacular and memorable narratives of emotional struggle in its season?<br />
<br />
It is hard to answer, and yet, it becomes so clear when you are watching it. Selling Yuru Camp is difficult, as one would need to rely on vague statements about its mood. It&#039;s quiet, it&#039;s soothing, watch it whenever you need to chill. That&#039;s it. I could end my review here and it would be the most straightforward recommendation because that is what this show is about: pure and unadulterated calmness and peace of mind. No more no less.<br />
<br />
But that would be too easy and misleading. Because it&#039;s not the simplicity and straightforwardness what makes this series work, but an execution that depends on a careful combination of directorial, cast, music and writing choices that shouldn&#039;t be dismissed just because the aim of the show is humble and simplistic. It is masterfully crafted in each of these elements and almost nothing in it feels random or inappropriate for the overall mood.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk first about the visual aspects of the show. A lot of things have been said about the sheer beauty and detail of the backgrounds, the use of a subdued color palette that makes everything look more relaxed and soothing, the clever use of lighting and so on. Each episode provides a good amount of wallpaper material and they do a great work at enhancing the beauty of the landscapes. But I would like to focus on something this series really excels at and makes everything work even better from a visually evocative point of view: framing. Yuru Camp is a series about outdoor activities and one of the things it does better at representing their appeal is reflecting with its visual language how vast and surrounding its scenarios are, in comparison with, say, confined rooms. Even more difficult if you take into account that it has to convey these feelings through characters that are part, and are reacting to that environment at that same time. By placing the characters at the right spot of the frame and by showing an astonishing sense of space and depth of field, the series manages to effectively transmit to the viewer a feeling of belonging there, and observing the environment along with, and not separately from the characters. It doesn&#039;t feature any particularly elaborate or flashy cinematographic trick but it does everything well in a way that I think very few have. A zoom-out that reveals a wonderful night view, a panoramic shot with the character surrounded by the immense beauty of her environment, a character moving towards the camera to properly reflect the depth of field. It is consistently clever and efficient at this and increases exponentially the appeal of its scenarios.<br />
<br />
The character designs leave more room for nitpicking. They have rather simple features, some kind of... questionable ones (what is up with those extra thin necks?) and overall they are designs that appeal to a fitting yet standard cutesy style. Past that level of simplicity, the thing is that they are actually very spot on in pretty much everything. They wear mundane and appropriate clothes, and the show has a surprising variety of outfits and styles for each of them. Particularly noteworthy is the big amount of aesthetic choices thrown around the character of Rin throughout the series, that make her quite visually dynamic and even leads to some running jokes with her hairstyles. Either way, I would not like to oversell the complexity of these character designs, since I think part of their appeal and also a very relevant fraction in the visual comedy of the show lie precisely in their simple and recognizable traits.<br />
<br />
These general aspects aside, the show itself has a number of little issues in its visuals that depending on the person and the focus may look more or less serious. The animation in particular. It is clean, fluid and average or above average, always serviceable enough; but there&#039;s not much focus on movement and the series can look quite static at times. It has some surprisingly complex and detailed animation but it is not consistent with that and specially in its latter half it abuses montages of static and frozen panning shots instead. The CG animation of the vehicles feels kind of off-putting, even with the attempts of the series to make up for it by focusing on the depth of field of the shot; thankfully none of these moments last very long. However the biggest issue comes with episode 8. It is pretty much universally agreed that this episode is an aesthetic low in the series with clumsy animation and characters going off model way too often throughout.<br />
<br />
Luckily, at least in my case, the flaws feel so irrelevant compared to all the great visual choices it makes that this aspect of the show remains impressive overall, with only a few occasional nitpicks here and there. What I&#039;d like to emphasize the most here is that the visual language in this series is crucial and it is effectively conveyed with clever decisions and execution. The series manages to nail the cathartic and the mundane equally and is one of the most purely aesthetic anime experiences I&#039;ve seen. And if you think that my views on the art are too positive, wait for the next section.<br />
<br />
The sound. Oh, how do I even start with this. It&#039;s absolute brilliance from start to finish. The soundtrack is quiet and fluffy, even at its most playful it&#039;s just plain laid-back. Entirely instrumental except for the opening and ending, it constantly evokes the atmosphere of relax and uneventful fun that permeates through the entire series. However what truly makes this series stand out in this department is not in the tracks themselves, but in their use in context. It understands the music not as an accompaniment, but as an essential element of its aesthetics and narrative. And this is specially relevant in a season that, overall, did not stand out much in this aspect and took a lot of my nitpicks for otherwise great shows. <br />
<br />
What Yuru Camp understands so well is that, yes, the music is fitting and sets a mood, but that shouldn&#039;t stop you from playing and being active and dynamic with it. You can&#039;t expect to play a beautiful song in the background, stop caring, and proceed to focus on the visual narrative and the dialogue, because no matter how good it sounds, it will end up creating an aesthetic dissonance. This series takes its effort to match the images, the frames and the timing of the narration with the soundtrack. It quite often makes use of sudden and accurately timed interruptions for comedic effect, it saves the most emphasized parts of the track for the single moments of catharsis and it perfectly captures the mundane. It knows when to stop and it knows when to start again, what track to use for each moment and how to make proper and emotionally (or comedically) effective transitions. If all of this sounds basic, imagine my frustration while watching other shows in its same season failing to understand this fundamental approach.<br />
<br />
And damn if it&#039;s effective. The love and care put in this aspect of the show is astounding. Heck, if it even went through the trouble of creating a separate and fitting soundtrack for each of the campsite locations. That&#039;s some level of dedication out there. Seriously, the music in this show is something else. Even for its generally excellent delivery this is an easy standout.<br />
<br />
The rest of the aspects of its sound design are also spot on. I love the effects, particularly those used to create atmosphere like the little ambient sounds, the wind breezing... that make the experience more immediate and relatable. As for the voice acting, the series has a very solid cast with a clear standout in Yumiri Hanamori&#039;s Nadeshiko. The way she nails the voice of her character, her sounds and her overall performance is essential to make Nadeshiko the cinnamon roll of unadulterated cuteness she is, and to do it with a character that was so easy to drive wrong has a lot of merit. Almost equal in merit and execution is Nao Touyama&#039;s Rin, a quiet type that is still perfectly empathic and entertaining to listen to, and knows how to add relatable nuances of emotion to a character that acts cold and restrained towards the rest. The rest of the cast all have fitting voices and add to the overall mood and the comedic effect of the characters, with another favorite of mine being Rie Takahashi&#039;s laid-back and playful role as Saitou. The energy of Chiaki and the soothing nature of Aoi are nailed as well and perfectly add to their style of humor. My only nitpick aside from some minor characters having more meh voices is with some little moments of Aki Toyosaki&#039;s Aoi. The character seems to have more creative freedom than the rest of the cast when it comes to the way she sounds, and at some points, episode 10 in special, that sort of rubbed me the wrong way.<br />
<br />
With the visual and sound aspects covered, we can move on to the writing. And since this is just cute girls doing cute camping things for twelve episodes this should be fast, right?<br />
<br />
Right?<br />
<br />
You know it won&#039;t. I&#039;m afraid you have to stay for a little while yet.<br />
<br />
One of my biggest pet peeves with anime criticism is the, in my opinion, excessive reliance on themes. When it comes to a story focused on the mundane, that uses observational and incidental narrative and doesn&#039;t focus in a central point, prioritizing in your speech the talk about transcendence and depth of themes is artificial and uncalled for. And I have even seen it with this show. It&#039;s not like Yuru Camp doesn&#039;t offer valuable insight on certain topics, I&#039;ll get there a bit later, but to make it the main point of appeal of the series is, to me, missing the point and applying standards it doesn&#039;t aim for. And the solution is not to dismiss the efforts of this show based on the simple immediacy of its premise either, specially if such immediacy is carried through an observant perspective that has its inherent difficulty.<br />
<br />
Why am I bringing this up? Because the writing of Yuru Camp is excellent. It is a definitive standout in its genre, and it is easily the most solid I could find in its season. The way it understands and applies character interactions through its entire run is nothing short of brilliant in its apparent simplicity and naturality.<br />
<br />
The first element I&#039;d like to tackle is the storyline. What I am about to say may sound surprising, but compared to other slice of life shows, I think the pure story aspect in this series is actually quite sophisticated, or perhaps I should say tightly structured. Contrarily to what one could think in a show that lives up to its premise of cute girls camping and having harmless fun, it has a clear narrative with perfect continuity throughout. All the characters undergo some sort of development regarding their interest on camping; some become more profficient, some start to contemplate other alternatives... The point I want to make with this is that in this show the narration is, above all, consequential. It constantly refers to previous events or circumstances, the attachment of the characters grows throughout and this development is kept as a basis for future interactions, both in the bigger picture and in slight and seemingly irrelevant details. This is true for all of them but particularly, as it&#039;s the main narrative focus, for the dynamics of Rin and Nadeshiko. Both learn from each other and we see how they gradually form an increasingly close relationship with some relevant transitions that have their emphasis in the narrative.<br />
<br />
The main focus of the show is the experience of camping and the attachment to what it has to offer. Some people have said, not without reason, that the characters and the events are way too focused on camping, and that it is difficult to obtain a bigger picture of them when their lives and conversations are so conveniently reduced to their hobby. This never bothered me personally because I think the running theme of camping is more than enough to create a significant introspection to the characters, particularly because the very nature of this activity leads to a lot of quiet observation and naturalistic depiction, but I can understand this being an issue, particularly if you want to observe the characters in other situations or frames of mind, or if you get bored by the lack of variety of focus.<br />
<br />
Speaking of its camping themes and focus, it also seems that a common issue among people who either disliked or don&#039;t share the enthusiasm for this show lies in the presence of a voiceover narrator who tells things to the viewer, serving as a tutorial for camping and giving advice. This is something I myself feel conflicted about, not because it bothers me personally, but because I honestly don&#039;t know how to draw the line and why do I find it acceptable and perfectly fine while other people feel completely unattached when it appears. To me I guess it has to do with how soothing the voice itself is, how it&#039;s strategically placed in the narration to avoid unnecessary interference with the natural interactions of the characters, or how at times it plays along with the characters and their mood.<br />
<br />
Through its running theme of camping the show talks as well about friendship and opening up to new experiences. And where it excels at is not so much the inherent complexity of its themes, but the execution and particularly in the amount of right narrative decisions taken throughout to build a conclusion that is constructive and inspiring. One of the greatest merits of the writing in this series is how it never puts the characters in a situation where they are stated to be in the wrong or need to be fixed, despite the obvious contrast in their personalities and approaches. This is specially true for Rin, who is introduced as an introvert and loves camping alone at the beginning, and through the series she develops a liking for camping with people. But the loner Rin is still there for the entire series. And her introversion is not fixed either: it is an essential character trait of her and the other characters respect her boundaries. A good deal of the laid-back atmosphere in this show is achieved through the mutual respect the girls feel for each other. Nadeshiko, the initially hyperactive and potentially invasive personality that would force Rin to change, quickly understands that pressuring her is wrong, and lets her grow at her own pace. At the same time, she learns from Rin too, while not changing a bit of her outgoing and enthusiastic personality. It is very refreshing to see this sort of development, and it speaks volumes not only to the mutual understanding and empathy displayed by the characters, but to the narrative focus itself and the respect the writing shows for their agency and individuality.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the characters, they could be defined by basic personality archetypes. As said, Rin is the loner introvert and Nadeshiko the outgoing enthusiast. This is also true for the rest of the characters who all have a set personality and defined traits. While some people have mentioned this as a negative, I don&#039;t think Yuru Camp suffers from having characters that meet an archetype or *sigh* &quot;can be defined in a single phrase&quot;. This is mostly because the writing stays refreshing and keeps finding new ways to explore the set traits of the characters throughout. And above all, it puts a lot of care in their interactions and chemistry together and with the surrounding environment.<br />
<br />
The key word here is spontaneity. Everything in this series is built around this premise. The dialogues are filled with casual banter, they have some exposition here and there without feeling like infodumps, but the conversations feel perfectly down-to-earth and relatable, which is even more fascinating if one takes into account how quirky and differentiable their basic character types are. And as a result of this comes one of the greatest, and probably one of the most unsung, merits of this series.<br />
<br />
Take the scene with Saitou drawing a &quot;funny face&quot; in Chikuwa&#039;s photo. Take the Outdoors Club girls&#039; silly imitations of camping objects and activities. Take the Santa Clangers, the &quot;intense&quot; chats between Rin and Saitou, Chiaki the evil kidnapper, Nadeshiko the granny and so on and on and on. There is something relevant around all of these moments. They are funny, but they don&#039;t need to. You don&#039;t need to find these jokes amusing in order for them to make sense because the ones they need to make sense to are the characters themselves. This lack of pandering is one of the things that put this show above so many of its competitors, particularly in the portrayal of friendships that, like any relationship, have their own codes and only make perfect sense to those who share them. Understanding this and not trying to tell the viewer &quot;hey, this is funny, that&#039;s why they are laughing&quot; but ultimately transmitting that the characters laugh because they genuinely, and no matter what you think, find this funny, is something I can never praise enough in this show. This is true even for Rin alone and her solitary interactions with her environment, filled with genuine moments of silliness and fun that are presented in the most natural way possible.<br />
<br />
A running theme with these girls and their relationships is the use of technology and this is another little aspect that I think deserves to be further emphasized. Where most other narratives either try to establish a contrast or never give enough importance to technology compared to &quot;real&quot;, face-to-face interactions, Yuru Camp understands and applies both as a continuum of each other. They use their phones to communicate, to have fun together, to organize plans and etc. Rin and Saitou for instance understand each other extremely well, and yet, most of their interactions in the show happen through a phone chat. You don&#039;t need to see them together in a room to figure out how strong their friendship and mutual confidence is, and when it happens it only confirms what we already knew. Another example is in the relationship of Rin and Nadeshiko and how they connect deeply with each other even when they are hundreds of kilometers away, to the point that at one scene Nadeshiko literally wants to chat with Rin and serve as a remote travel guide to her solo camping adventure because that way she feels connected to Rin&#039;s journey.<br />
<br />
Last but not least in this talk about characters and writing, going back to the importance of spontaneity, comes the comedy. Now, we all know the issue about comedy so it&#039;s not worth mentioning it again. What makes me laugh won&#039;t necessarily make you laugh and so on. But I can&#039;t deny that I laugh a lot with this series. Maybe even more than I could expect, considering how little it does to try to structure its jokes as, well, jokes. In fact, this may actually work in its advantage and it&#039;s absolutely worth mentioning the lack of a consistent straight man routine in this series. Whenever the characters do something silly, they seem to prefer playing along than reacting in disbelief or pointing out where the joke exactly is. As a result, a lot of these comedic moments feel spontaneous and lacking a separated structure, and above all, they don&#039;t overstay their welcome.<br />
<br />
Ultimately however, what makes Yuru Camp work and what explains its appeal to me is the synergy of all the individual elements mentioned above. Visual emphasis, soundtrack, character writing and storytelling combine to form a single and inseparable entity, which could only be achieved by putting individual care on each of them but also factoring a clear overall vision. The perfect embodiment of this lies in its conclusion, one of the most solid and appropriate I have ever seen in the medium, and which I don&#039;t think could even be possible had the show not been as carefully planned and integrated as it was during its whole run.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow, this review went a long way. I had a lot of fun writing this, but think I owe you all an apology if you reached this point, specially considering that I haven&#039;t even used the word &quot;comfy&quot; yet in this review of Yuru Camp. Either way, thanks for taking your time to read this absurdly huge piece of enthusiastic rambling, if you have any feedback or commentary on what I wrote feel free to tell me.

    One of my favorite genres in anime is slice of life, I just really love how it makes me feel. Now there are different varieties of slice of life anime out there. There&#039;s romance, drama, school setting, and just in general every day life.<br />
<br />
Yuru Camp is a typical every day life type of anime. What is it about? It&#039;s about a group of girls that go camping, and sometimes some of them go solo camping. And that&#039;s pretty much it.<br />
<br />
Admittedly it doesn&#039;t have the most interesting of ideas, but it somehow makes it work. I fell in love with Rin and the rest of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274813">
        girls, seeing them interact and their friendship become stronger was just really rewarding to see.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m an introvert in real life, so I&#039;m always worried how anime will protray introverted characters, but in my opinion at least Rin is one of my favorite introverted characters out there. She wasn&#039;t made fun of, she wasn&#039;t hated on, no one thought she was strange for wanting time alone. <br />
<br />
She&#039;s not socially awkward, she&#039;s not painfully shy. She&#039;s just more quiet than most, and that is how I personally am in real life.<br />
<br />
So of course I was drawn to Rin immediately. Rin is the main character. As I said before she&#039;s a introvert, someone that likes being alone, but who doesn&#039;t mind the company occasionally, and I like that.<br />
<br />
Nadeshiko is a hyper active girl that loves to eat. Normally hyperactive characters can be hit or miss for me, but I really enjoyed Nadeshiko&#039;s character a lot. She actually reminded me of a friend I had in high school, who like Nadeshiko was just very happy go lucky/hyperactive. Which was nice to see.<br />
<br />
I also really enjoyed how Rin and Nadeshiko&#039;s interactions became more valuable as the series continued. While Rin was okay with Nadeshiko camping with her, it was almost as though she wasn&#039;t quite sure how to act around her, in the sense that she looked at Nadeshiko oddly.<br />
<br />
But as the series continued you could tell that they were becoming close friends. For instance Rin smiling whenever Nadeshiko did something, or Nadeshiko being so happy to see Rin.  <br />
<br />
Next is Aoi, a quiet, soft spoken girl who likes to joke around occasionally.<br />
<br />
And finally Chiaki: A very loud and out going girl who isn&#039;t afraid to go after things that she wants.<br />
<br />
There are other characters of course, but those are the main four characters. I really wish that Aoi and Chiaki had gotten more screen time, especially involving Rin, but their interactions were a lot of fun as well.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not an outdoor person, I personally hate the cold, but this series actually made me want to go camping. <br />
<br />
I adored the characters, the characters interactions were a lot of fun to watch. I felt so comfy and had a big smile the majority of the time I watched it.<br />
<br />
The series had a normal length time in episodes, but it felt like just 5-10 minutes had passed instead of the 22+ minutes. Not saying that&#039;s how you&#039;ll feel of course , that&#039;s just how I personally felt with the series.<br />
<br />
If you are a slice of life fan, than you will likely enjoy this series, if you aren&#039;t a slice of life fan and are wanting to try slice of life series, maybe try something else first? And then work your way here? If you&#039;re just starting out in the slice of life genre this might be too slice of life for you, but maybe not, the only one who will really know is you.<br />

    We all search for a place to escape the difficult parts in life, whether it be movies, games or anime, we all seek something that makes us relax and enjoy living rather than stress about how difficult life is, Yuru Camp I think is the best when it comes to avoiding all that stress. <br />
<br />
Yuru Camp is the most relaxing experience you might ever have in your life, the anime is great and you notice that from how happy you feel watching the episodes, each episode is like a new adventure with all characters being so loveable and cute it makes it an even more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274560">
        amazing experience, you get to see how great camping is, why people love doing it and the amazing scenery that makes you want to get up and travel there just to see how wonderful it looks and that pretty much explains a lot of the charm in Yuru Camp.<br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t much in the story other than the girls camping but you still enjoy it a lot watching how each character interacts with the others and how they move on and become better friends and their relationships get stronger which is very satisfying to see. <br />
<br />
The characters in Yuru Camp are great from the 5 MCs to the side characters, they are all very cute and loveable with each of them having her own characteristics that makes her unique and different from the rest, My personal favorite is probably Inuyama or Nadeshiko, Inuyama is only above the others because of how good her character design is (even though the rest of the designs, hers is just my favorite) while Nadeshiko is also better than the rest because of how cute her character is but in terms of overall characteristics then all of them are pretty much on the same level which shows how much attention was put into the characters. <br />
<br />
The art is phenomenal, The designs are great and the scenery and background is outstanding, if you somehow hate the characters you could just turn off the sound and subtitles and just enjoy how stunning it looks. <br />
<br />
The OSTs are great, the Opening and Ending are amazing specially the ending since it really fits the atmosphere and all of that shows how great the sound directing is, well to be honest the directing of the whole anime was amazing. <br />
<br />
Also I loved the Kino No Tabi reference at the end :D Both this and Kino are in my favorite anime list for a reason. <br />
<br />
Overall I would give it a 10/10 and I&#039;m extremely sad watching one of the very few things that made me completely relaxed in my life end and I&#039;m really going to miss it :&#039;(  <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t believe I almost didn&#039;t watch it at the start of the season.<br />
I can only hope for a 2nd season. <br />
<br />
I would recommend this to anyone that likes being happy tbh.

    Camping 101 <br />
Starring: cute girls!<br />
<br />
We’ve had cute girls sailing to Antarctica, (Further than the Universe) cute girls in the apocalypse (Girls’ Last Tour), cute girls singing, dancing, and playing instruments (anime like K-On!, Love-Live! And Hibike! Euphonium), and just cute girls doing nothing whatsoever (Lucky star and Yuyushiki). Now we have cute girls going camping.<br />
<br />
It literally does what it says on the packet. It’s a very relaxed slice-of-life anime about camping, including all the aspects you would expect to see in a camping anime. It goes into great detail about the campsites they visit, the equipment they use (everything from how they buy it to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274550">
        how they set it up), the food they make (which by the way, looks amazing and will make you hungry if you watch it before eating), and the way they bond through camping together. I learnt enough about camping from this one anime that, assuming I ever wanted to go, I would know exactly how to prepare and what to do.<br />
<br />
And it’s nice to watch. It’s very slow paced, each episode generally consists of planning and executing a different camping trip. The art and animation are fantastic; the scenery in particular is drawn absolutely beautifully. All the right colours and tones are used to convey the autumn-like feeling perfectly. The sound also fits the mood of the anime to a T. <br />
<br />
There are five main characters, although the story mainly focusses on two of them. Rin is the silent one who enjoys the peace and quiet of camping alone. She doesn’t tend to socialise much, and this is what makes her friendship with the outgoing and talkative Nadeshiko endearing to watch. You get to know Rin through her actions – the way her face lights up when she sips a hot cocoa, the way she stares at a gorgeous view like she’s trying to devour it, the way she cares about her friends despite sometimes acting like they’re a nuisance to her. She’s very relatable as a character, and that’s part of why I liked the anime so much.<br />
<br />
Nadeshiko, as mentioned before, is the talkative one. She’s also the clumsy, energetic and downright adorable one. She’s the type of girl who injects life into the anime, and helps speed up the pace when it becomes too snail-like. Her becoming friends with Rin is essentially the premise of the anime – they meet by chance on a camping site, and, in the way of anime, find out they go to the same school together. She and Rin are a lot like chalk and cheese; apart from their love of camping they couldn’t be more different. However their friendship blossoms nonetheless, and by the end of the anime they’ve formed a solid relationship.<br />
<br />
The other main characters are relatively enjoyable to watch, although they aren’t as developed as Rin and Nadeshiko. Aki and Aoi are girls in the same camping club as Nadeshiko, and Ena is a friend of Rin’s who’s persuaded to come along for the ride. Apart from camping, the anime mainly shows them in school, going shopping, working and just hanging out together. Nothing exciting or even particularly interesting, but their interactions are mildly humorous, very light-hearted, and always cute. The series shows how they each react to the camping aspect, and what each of them actually enjoys about camping. For some it’s the peace, for some it’s the food, and for some it’s the companionship. Regardless, after watching this I felt I would probably enjoy camping too for one reason or the other. <br />
<br />
Now, although I said this anime was nice to watch, I wouldn’t call it entertaining. It’s more like you feel contented with the world after watching it. I had to be in a certain frame of mind to see it – when I was in the mood for something fast-paced and thrilling, I watched another anime. <br />
<br />
So, if you’re looking for something tranquil, something cute and relaxing, this is a good choice. If you’re not, then I’d give this one a miss until you are. XD<br />

Ever spend the afternoon listening to those lo-fi hip-hop playlists on Youtube? The ones that play a long playlist of relaxing instrumentals over gifs of animated characters either studying, reading, or floating in outer space? If so, then you have probably experienced, through audio, the kind of feeling that Yuru Camp embodies and presents to you. The chirping birds and licking of river water as it wraps around the rocky shoreline. A group of students out at campsites, under no threat, in no danger, with no drama, cooking food for one another and conversing about what they value. The term here is “laid-back”, and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275068">
        show translates that for its title. <br />
<br />
The series here follows Shima Rin as she camps out in various locations around Mount Fuji, from lakes to open fields. Along the way, she meets Nadeshiko, a spunky, goofy pink-haired girl that has a similar, yet louder passion for camping. Later, we realize they go to the same school and lo-and-behold there is even a camping club, because of course there is, with a few other equally cute girls with a seemingly diehard passion for sleeping in linen huts outside. That’s our story. No less and no more. <br />
<br />
From here we venture into their day-to-day lives. Without the burden of classes, social interaction, or growth for anyone but maybe Rin towards the end of the series. It really feels like a flatline in the best possible way, I suppose. As in, the line here is “comfort” and the series encapsulates that comfort as well as it can within the parameters it draws. These parameters being the set locations during the winter in the small vicinity around where these characters live in Japan. It isn’t for everyone but fortunately, it offers a lot to the crowd that really seems attached to the iyashikei presentation with a healthy dollop of feel-good humor. <br />

[Camping Under the Stars and Presentation]<br />
<br />
Funny faces, chibi inspired designs, and crackling campfires, Yuru Camp isn’t going to blow you away visually. Much like the rest of the series, it often has an air of decentness that you can’t help but acquiesce to after a few episodes roll by without your notice. That’s kind of the charm of it. The character design is serviceable, without many standouts. Each girl has the expected wide pallet of hair-color and generally looks alright. Where the series, and the people making it, clearly put the most thought into was the honestly great variety of outfits worn. Now each one is a variation of winter-clothing, but they were never ridiculous or unbelievable and, throughout the runtime, each episode seemingly had a unique selection of designs to attach to these characters. Good stuff all around, here. <br />
<br />
The music is also not anemic, thankfully. The opening is catchy, the closer is quite frankly the best track in the series, and there enough background tunes to keep you engaged and on occasion bob your head to. Similar to those lo-fi hip-hop beats, that kind of melodic, unobtrusive, and relaxing feeling is injected into the soundtrack. <br />
<br />
There is also nothing licentious here. Everything doesn’t feel like it is there to sell sex. While this is something I hate to bring up in every anime I seem to review, it is a problem that just plagues this medium. While this series is easily pandering to a certain crowd, it’s not doing so through sexual means and is never obnoxious about it and I will gladly take a series that doesn’t drill sexual fanservice into your eyes every chance it gets. The entire thing feels wholesome, and a focus on sexualization would undermine that. The creatives seem to understand this and avoid it. Even the scenes in the hot springs are very neutral and don’t have anything sleazy under the hood. Thumbs up for that.<br />
<br />
Overall, the presentation is solid. I might even call it above average. It is where I expect a show like this to be. The directing is generally unremarkable, but the music and the decent production more than make up for that. The voice acting didn’t blow my socks off but thankfully it avoids being shrill and loud. <br />

[Narrative, Characters, or Lack Thereof] <br />
<br />
Deadpan high schoolers, eccentric glasses, and alcoholic teachers with seemingly no care for students, there really isn’t much to latch onto in this show. Of course, that’s my opinion and I’m sure for some just the serene experience of the whole thing can be enough. The atmosphere here is exceptional, but the characters that inhabit the atmosphere are about as normal as they come. Each one possesses a very minuscule amount of quirks or habits that didn’t do much to intrigue me. While you could argue that’s the point and the series wasn’t trying to intrigue me, I can’t help but feel like they could’ve done more with these characters.<br />
<br />
Of course, a show without a shred of conflict is just that, though, a show without a shred of conflict. Conflict grows characters and the deepest conflict here is often running out of food to eat. Again, that’s the point, but there really should’ve been more to the characters that we got to learn about as they bonded together. These girls, the four specific ones that took up most of the show, don’t change or give us, the viewer, anything to chew on other than pretty scenery and delicious looking food. Which is a plus, the food looks great and watching cute girls eat food is something I will unabashedly indulge in (especially when it isn’t obnoxiously over the top). Even Rin, our protagonist, who goes through the biggest “arc” of the series doesn’t get much to think about or ponder. <br />
<br />
The lack of conflict is a flaw in entertainment value, but a flaw that I think will easily be looked past by the people specifically looking for a series that doesn’t have conflict and is an iyashekei. That’s kind of the sharp-end of criticism, though, the flaws I see are often not what someone else sees. The nonchalant atmosphere is nice to sit back and enjoy, however, I doubt I’ll be thinking back to this series as something memorable or worth revisiting. <br />
<br />

[Conclusion]<br />
<br />
Do you want an overtly wholesome parade of cute anime girls camping? The comedy here isn’t in abundance, but it’s there. It’s okay for anime comedy, too, occasionally making me breath air out of my nose. Yuru Camp relies on expectations more than anything. What do you want and ultimately, what engages you as a viewer? A lot of the flaws here, beyond some of the awkward CG vehicles and weaker animated segments are exceedingly subjective. It’s hard to argue that this series isn’t feel-good and it’s almost impossible for me to say I didn’t like a good portion of it. Even the slower moments were relaxing as all hell, and while the ideas presented here may feel myopic to some viewers, none of it felt tepid. Even the truly “laid-back” moments, which manifested in five-minute segments of almost no dialogue, relaxing music, and maybe some monologuing, are relatively easy on the eyes and will, on more than one occasion, make you feel what this show is trying to make you feel. Comfortable.<br />
<br />
Oh, and camping. This series makes you camp. Regardless of interesting characterization, what Yuru Camp does most well at is the meticulous creation of the scenarios at hand, here. A lot of the series is based on easy-reveals and drama-less conflict-resolution that feels good. For example, your hands are cold because it is cold out. You take your hand warmers and place them in your hands and exhale happily. That is a drama-less resolution, especially when one of your good friends walks up behind you and passes the hand-warmers to you and you smile and greet them. <br />
<br />
This continues simply with the fact that the original creators of the manga this series is based on smartly made it set during the winter. A cold time that can often feel lonely alone. So of course, Rin, our lone-warrior of cute camping girls, ends up coming around and finding friends to camp with. Of course, there will be multiple scenes of snuggling up with yourself in a sleeping bag and cosplaying caterpillars. Because that’s cute, and you can probably imagine just how warm that feeling is and in turn you are suddenly in a place of comfort and relaxation.  I commend the series for these smart creative choices that made for a better watch.<br />
<br />
Then it’s the minuscule details to continue this streak of excessively unrealistic but ultimately satisfying interactions. Such as texting your friend at night and getting a response immediately. It almost never happens in the real world but damn it if it doesn’t feel good when it does happen. Sharing a vista with a close one. Cooking food for someone and ultimately getting that favor returned by them later. Sharing a laugh. Admiring a sunset. Looking over the lake and not caring about tomorrow because hopefully today will last forever.<br />
<br />
These are all great qualities and don’t let my above-average score fool you. If you are seeking something like this, this may be the best show of the season for you. It is very time-oriented. If I was going through an excessively difficult time in real life and I threw this show on, at night, by myself, I would have most likely enjoyed it even more. Note that. Value what you value and don’t let this wholesome series slip by you. <br />

    Yuru Camp△ was recommended to me by a friend who thought it would be a decent foodie anime, and this turned out to be so much more. <br />
<br />
Story and Character 6/10<br />
It&#039;s about a girl whose grandfather loves camping, and handed down camping gear to his grand daughter, who frequently goes solo-camping, in the winter. This is peak Iyashikei anime, feel-good slice of life, with a heavy focus on camping and a secondary focus on food (at least in Season 1). Normally I&#039;m not into Cute Girls Doing Cute Things, but here, it was wholesome. Even the dog is adorable. <br />
<br />
The friendships felt real, not forced.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410666">
        Someone who is by nature a loner, like Rin, is going to take a bit of persuasion to break out of their normal mold. It didn&#039;t happen overnight, and required a ton of work by a very outgoing person to achieve. Even so, Nadeshiko, the persuader didn&#039;t just give up when first told no, but naturally asked several times until their request was eventually accepted. In the meantime, Nadeshiko didn&#039;t just mope, she went along and joined the Outdoor Club, making other friends and going camping with them while slowly working on getting Rin to accept that maybe camping is more fun with other people (although both still go Solo Camping). This more than anything made me enjoy the anime more, how the mangaka let the friendships develop.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
There&#039;s nothing I would change. The scenery is so gorgeous, frames from this could be used as paintings. I love how Mt. Fuji is depicted in various phases of it&#039;s glory, making it seem shy, coy, &quot;blusing&quot;, mysterious and majestic, depending on where it is viewed from. The girls are all cute, with different features / hair and adorable Moe faces, which, for once, I did not find super annoying.<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
It fits with the anime, but the OP reminded me a lot of The Jackson&#039;s ABC. The ED song is slow, peaceful and has an almost soporific effect on me.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10<br />
This was really fun to watch. The friendships naturally unfolding over beautiful scenery and tasty food. If this is something you like you&#039;ll enjoy this anime.<br />
<br />
Foodie Rating 5.4/10<br />
05/10 Visual appeal of food - some have basic animation, could have been better.<br />
05/10 Reaction of characters to food - laid back reaction. Characters enjoy the food and make moe faces. Nothing over the top.<br />
03/10 Difficulty or complexity of food featured - none this stuff is too hard, due to equipment restrictions.<br />
06/10 Preparation or Cooking Instructions - there&#039;s some instructions of how to cook this food in a camp setting, and in one episode they actually say &quot;If you follow instructions, you can do it&quot;, which will give viewers the confidence to do this in real life.<br />
08/10 Desire of viewer to cook or buy dishes featured after watching show - Will make you want to go camping and try to cook those dishes. Especially if you have the gear, and friends and a spot to go camping at.<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10<br />
Very good would like to watch more. I did have the desire to go camping after watching this anime, alas, they ARE realistic about how camping is not a cheap hobby when you consider all the gear required. Not only did I learn a lot about the science of camping, and the art of photo taking, but I have to say Japan&#039;s camping scene seems very organized.<br />

    In a part of the medium of anime where school settings are common, Yuru Camp decides to take us to the outdoors, and provides us with a fresh, more rare setting to indulge ourselves in.<br />
<br />
A large part of the appeal of Yuru Camp to me and many others is how the activities being shown can all be attempted in real life. This not only leads more people to try outdoor activities, but it allows people like me to relate to the time we spend outdoors. In my case, after many years of camping, hiking, backpacking, and hunting in Oregon, this show brings back memories of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277897">
        my childhood spent outdoors and the joys of friendship. With a setting in a show that connects you to an enjoyable part of real life, a whole new level of enjoyment is reached.<br />
<br />
Accomponing the story of this show is a comfortable blend of incredible landscape scenes, music, and tremendously cute characters. Many of the landscapes present in Yuru Camp are based upon real life locations in Japan, even the art of this show can bring you to connect with real places! With the art comes the music, which is composed of a relaxing collection of guitars, flutes, and other noises that compliment the story and art perfectly.<br />
<br />
Onto the characters, which make or break cute shows like this. There are 2 characters in which the most time is spent on, Rin and Nadeshiko, they are pretty much polar opposites. Rin is calm, independent, and loves to spend time alone, while Nadeshiko is full of energy and finds excitement from everything. When the two spend time together or communicate over texting, you can often see their personalities clash and cause moments that make you smile. The rest of the cast does not see too much time until later on, but still has their fair share of enjoyable moments. <br />
<br />
There are 2 more minor parts of Yuru Camp that really stood out to me, this would be the traveling, and the food. The traveling by Rin on her moped shows just how independent she is, Rin is able to show us a variety of different dogs and different locations. Additionally, she often communicates with Nadeshiko and other friends by means of texting, these texts are often some of the most hilarious and enjoyable parts, every text is voiced and animated on the entire screen. This approach was unique and adds much enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Secondly, there is the food. The food in Yuru Camp is yet another part that can be attempted in real life. Food is a major component of camping and Yuru Camp does not shy away from showing that. The entire process of cooking is usually displayed, from the preparation of ingredients all the way to the cute blobs of moe consuming these glorious, steaming Nippon delicacies. The cuteness of the food being eaten is absolutely outstanding. <br />
<br />
With Yuru Camp, you can wash away the stresses of your life and dive into a world of comfort that is never eroded, and once the episodes are over, you can bring the activities to the real world, and you can see that sometimes outside isn’t too bad. If you need some happiness and comfort in your life, Yuru Camp will deliver that, 10 times over.<br />

Yuru Camp is an anime that tells the story of some high school girls who love camping. This anime is that kind of Cute Girls doing cute things and nothing else. A very healthy anime I must say. You will have a relaxed and comfortable feeling along the way. And also this anime makes me want to go camping with all my family. It was really relaxing to watch, the story was relaxed and there was no burden. A little dramatic at times, but funny at the same time. The music

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401024">
        is also interesting and easy to digest the lyrics. Lots of funny and interesting moments to see per episode. Like funny noises from the forest or objects. And the characters are also interesting and have their respective characteristics. The characters&#039; faces are also cute and interesting to watch and sometimes funny. There are many lessons we can take from this anime, especially about camping and friendship.<br />
em portugues <br />
Yuru Camp é um anime que conta a história de algumas garotas do ensino médio que adoram acampar. Este anime é aquele tipo de Cute Girls fazendo coisas fofas e nada mais. Um anime muito saudável, devo dizer. Você terá uma sensação relaxante e confortável ao longo do caminho. E também esse anime me dá vontade de fazer um acampamento com toda minha família.foi realmente relaxante assistir, a história foi descontraída e não havia nenhum fardo. Um pouco dramático às vezes, mas engraçado ao mesmo tempo. A música também é interessante e fácil de digerir a letra. Muitos momentos engraçados e interessantes para ver por episódio. Como ruídos engraçados da floresta ou objetos. E os personagens também são interessantes e têm suas respectivas características. Os rostos dos personagens também são bonitos e interessantes de se ver e às vezes engraçados. Há muitas lições que podemos tirar desse anime, especialmente sobre acampamento e amizade.<br />

    Yuru Camp is an anime that tells a story about some highschool girls that love to camp. This anime is that type of Cute Girls Doing Cute Things and nothing else. Very wholesome anime should i say. You will got a relaxing and comfiness feeling along the way. And also this anime makes me want to do a camping with all my family.<br />
<br />
Story 10/10<br />
Yuru Camp Story is really really simple there are no major problem in here, even if there is a problem it just a little thing and they can solve it quickly. I can say that the story here is predictable, but it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400716">
        is not a big deal because the main thing here is not the story. This is just literary Cute Girls Doing Cute Things, nothing else. This anime is really got the comedy too. Even when you know all the character here, you will laugh when they just literary speaking with each other.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
Yuru Camp art is a masterpiece. If you watch this series yourself, you will be caught in awe too. The background is so beautiful and detailed, even it is so similar with their real life places that there are a video on YouTube comparing it. Their character design is so unique too. They didn&#039;t look so complicated but still the people here all look so beautiful. And don&#039;t forget, that all the foods here are look so delicious.<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
All music in Yuru Camp is so great. From the BGM all the way to the anime ED and OP. Sometimes when i&#039;m alone in my room or got bored i listen to the BGM and it makes everything feel so much better. The OP and ED is in my music playlist too. They are so catchy and same as the BGM, it will make everything better. Oh yeah don&#039;t forget about the SFX too. They really nail it, especially when they are cooking. The frying sound, the boiling sound, the eating sound, everything.<br />
<br />
Character 10/10<br />
All the characters in Yuru Camp is a nice people, there are no villain here of course. Even with stranger they talk like they bestfriend for a long time. This makes me want to go into Yuru Camp world where all people here is like family, caring with each other. Live there must be so great. But yeah, this is an anime you cannot go there. There are not a lot of character in here, so you don&#039;t dizzy remembering all the people name. And also the character here are so relatable because they reaction isn&#039;t out of this world.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
I am really enjoying this anime to the fullest. I remember that i watch the 3 final episode of this anime in a blanket midnight with a cup of coffee, thats what i call heaven. Also my cheek got tired because i&#039;m always smiling every single time when i watch an episode of Yuru Camp, it just that wholesome. I will definetely rewatch this series, because i want to give myself more comfiness in the future. When i have enough money, i will buy the manga too.<br />
<br />
With all that being said, should you watch this anime? Hell yeah you should, especially if you are Slice Of Life fans. I recommend that you watch it in midnight or early in the morning, where you are alone and nothing else will interrupt you. So yeah, thank you so much for reading my review of Yuru Camp.<br />
<br />

    OH HELL YES, another AOTS contender (besides Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho) and with EVEN LESS marketing from a budding studio (C-Station of Starmyu fame and forget all the other crap they did), with a simple yet engaging premise that&#039;s all about camping and with that, a lesson on camping skills and whatnot along with the simple character designs and personalities, with the beautiful breath-taking art that makes this series a sleeper hit indefinitely! Smiliar to Yorimoi, another (presumed) 11/10 rating that sums up how much I enjoyed the Iyashikei (healing) effect from start to end, and will miss this series to say the least

Well, the starting point for this show is kinda intriguing as it shows Nadeshiko Kagamihara (WOW what a tongue-twister this name is) moving over from Shizuoka to Yamanishi to capture the view Mount Fuji right on Japan&#039;s 1000-yen bill. Problem is, after the whole journey and reaching her destination, only to fall asleep. Enter Rin Shima, the self-proclaimed girl who can camp out (and I guess her purpose is exploration) and is a skilled one that knows the way of camping (with her grandpa being the narrator if you haven&#039;t guessed so already), and with that, the journey of an after-encounter of the duo headstarts to find places of interest (of camping of course) whilst opening up to one another, and eventually with the Outdoor Camping Club duo (Aio Inuyama, Chiaki Oogaki), the (another quadruple) 4 girls attempt to learn all about camping, from finding the right places to the right equipment needed for a lasting experience, and ending off on a high note that&#039;s to expect with enjoying each other&#039;s company.<br />
<br />
So, for comparison sake between Yorimoi and Yuru Camp:<br />
Similarities - Group of CGDCT-esque girls doing their stuff, and enjoying to the best of their abilities, and just soaking in the atmosphere.<br />
Differences - The course of their heading (plot pointers), the overall atmosphere (calm and composed vs. happening and progressing), and of course the source material (Yorimoi being an original work vs. Yuru Camp from the manga source of the same name)<br />
<br />
No matter the similarities and the differences, both shows are definite must-watch-ers from the get-go from Winter 2018, and quarterback AOTSes.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
It is with NO doubt that Yuru Camp&#039;s strongest point is at its characters (see the similarity?), and how their engagement with each other piques their interest and bad-rubbing, though the latter (I believe) serves as a plot pointer in the friendships.<br />
<br />
Rin Shima (CV: veteran Nao Touyama of Nisekoi&#039;s Chitoge) is a nice protagonist-esque character, seeing that her abilities (learnt from her grandfather) serves her well as a solo, lone camper, entrusting herself with all the hard work from start to finish. Of course, that is until Nadeshiko&#039;s enthusiasm rubs her the wrong way at first till acceptance, and in that essence, opens her cold heart towards others who have the same interest and ambitions. To that extent, IMO I can really emphatize with Rin because most of the time she&#039;s a loner, until that heart warms up to other people and being welcome of it, definitely appreciate the progression of Rin.<br />
<br />
IMO the best girl (and waifu), Nadeshiko Kamigahara (CV: Yumiri Hanamori of Grimoire of Zero&#039;s Zero) IMMEDIATELY stands out above the rest for her enthusiasm that&#039;s so mesmerizing (and NO I&#039;m NOT kidding) and encouraging others with her wwwiiiiddddeee brilliant smile across her face with her weird antics that make her one of the most covenanted characters in the series to no end. Everything of her feels like a joke, yet in a comical sense that delivers strong on the aspects of the show, knowing when to take a dump on jokes and whatnot that comes as a striking resemblance to how we enjoy our youth by doing stupid things that made no sense, but enjoy it for the fervor that gives us the presence of our younger times.<br />
<br />
The Outdoor Camping Club gang of Aoi Inuyama, Chiaki Oogaki and Ena Saitou (voiced by supporting CVs Aki Toyosaki, Sayuri Hara, Rie Takahashi) also delivers on the plot points from their inclusion to the series (when Nadeshiko is introduced to the club) to the camping engagement with Rin, and it all makes up with none of the half-assed effort and goes full-on with their character personalities via the relationship towards Rin and Nadeshiko, and both of them serve their purpose as to be aspiring campers (again, like the other camping experienced duo), to make full use of their time to enjoy camping to the max.<br />
<br />
Plus the other side-characters, another strong lineup of characters that are just willing to try and not get fazed even by (minor) challenges (such as Chiaki and Nadeshiko&#039;s shock towards the expensive equipment), so much so that it&#039;s exciting to watch these characters mingle with one another and enjoy a purposefully themed Yuru (Laid-Back) Camp.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation:<br />
C-Station (of Starmyu fame) did an impressive job on this manga adaptation, recapturing the sights and wonders of the simple yet artisitic manga drawings into the anime art that is chock full with the most beautiful and realistic of sites found in real life (e.g. 1000-yen billed Mt. Fuji in Episode 1).<br />
To see sites replicated in real life into anime form, that is truly the blessing of those of us who have done camping as a hobby and it certainly brought tears of joy that the experience is undoubtedly the same as it was in real life. Thumbs up for keeping the art aesthetics consistent with animation that&#039;s not too glaring nor uneasy that spoils the visuals, and instead, basks in the natural state of the world as we see fit.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Another OST to look out for in Winter 2018, and an awesome and comfy one at that!!!<br />
<br />
Music composer Akiyuki Tateyama definitely has props when it comes to music (through Shimoneta and Kemono Friends), and it shows here to a T. Anybody who has listened to the OST will definitely agree on its surprising narration, starting with Asaka&#039;s energetic OP &quot;Shiny Days&quot; (which bears a striking similarity to Jackson 5&#039;s &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;), ending with Eri Sasaki&#039;s calm, relaxing acoustic ED &quot;Fuyu Biyori&quot; (still loving her bright, warm voice as evidently heard in Plastic Memories OP which STILL really brought tears of joy) to the BGM which fits so carefully and glides along with the present situation at hand. Overall, another strong OST in the books.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Aside from being some people&#039;s AOTS, this hidden gem truly is a blast to watch and be immersed if just for the camping aspect alone. This series overall really blew my mind away at how simple yet enticing the show-and-tell ability that most shows try to do but fail outright, and this is the one exception of a few that did what it was supposed to do from the outset, with great fervor and confidence.<br />
<br />
You know what? Maybe we should try to appreciate the outliers more (such as this, Yorimoi etc.) than just a show that we would skip from the beginning, and this show gave me hope that more of us can be exposed to these kinds of shows. A heartfelt recommended watch so we can all be exposed to the life and hobby of more than just the camping life.<br />
<br />
...And now I feel tempted to travel to Japan to just experience the camping life :-(<br />
IT&#039;S THAT MESMERIZING AND GOOD!!!

And the pine cone said &quot;Konnichiwa!&quot;. Welcome to Yuru Camp△, a cutesy take on the slice of life aspect of camping, following a group of adventurous girls who love the outdoors as much as each other!<br />
<br />
What sucked me in to this story of camping was that the atmosphere was so peaceful and relaxing. Leaving out the frantic setting in other anime, it let blissfulness shine through in an adorably positive manner. As someone who only knows about camping very straightforwardly, the simple presentation on the tips and techniques were given in an understandable format, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274542">
        I definitely didn&#039;t mind learning about them! All the girls contained their own likable personalities, an entertaining factor on its own. Collectively, they were funny, happy, and all in all full of positivity. This was a simple yet great recipe to create a comfortable feeling of comfiness that warms you up. Their interactions with each other were pure. While they were close at heart upon meeting for the first time, the bonds became stronger every passing day in their camp life. It was an honest friendship that was enjoyable to watch while they set up their tents, cook their foods, or view the scenery as day turned into night. And I give my appreciation to the setting based on real sites such as Mount Fuji. These cozy areas seemed like they were great places to fully relax with nature.<br />
<br />
While I talk about setting, the outdoor landscapes were beautiful to look at. The attention to detail with the grass blowing or the reflections in the lake all added up into one simple but great visual. For the animation, it was essentially laid-back but it was a perfect complement for the peaceful atmosphere. Each girls possessed their own cute expressions when they were having a good time and I also loved their character designs. Their winter get-up was adorable, looking like a bundle of fluffiness. This presence of the girls enjoying the outdoor life together just makes the air around them so clean and refreshing. Ambience of natural sounds unwinded the body, preparing to absorb and connect to what nature can offer to us with its own environmental audio. Each scenes that were blown over by the soft soundtracks had a gentle and mellow vibe, enriching the quiet world of the lands away from the bustling cities. Whereas for the opening song, the upbeat tone matched the girls&#039; lively personalities, and the soothing ending song concluded their enjoyable day on a tranquil note.<br />
<br />
Feel free from the rush of everyday life and go breathe in the fresh air of nature around us. Yuru Camp△ takes out all the current hassle and stress out of you, leaving you with feelings of content and a pleasant smile at every episode. So what&#039;s there more to wait? Bring in the marshmallows with you, we&#039;re going camping!

Cute series makes you forget your daily stress after watching it. Amazing voice acting specially for Nadeshiko. I love the Nadeshiko character due to her voice. The series is about camping. But it also reveals the enjoyment did you during the journey which is priceless. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s make you feel to leave your busy life and enjoy the bliss of nature. <br />
It&#039;s a comfy anime to enjoy. It&#039;s make you realise the fun involving spending nights under the stars. The background music is also very soothing. It&#039;s also provide little knowledge about camping. This is my first review so forgive me if I done any mistakes
