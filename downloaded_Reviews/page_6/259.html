    Do you enjoy anime? Odds are that you do, if you are on this site and reading this review.<br />
   <br />
From the producer who brought you Cowboy Bebop, and Samurai Champloo, comes SPACE DANDY (season 2 in this case), and Space Dandy is a platform that  both celebrates and lampoons anime topes from every genre, using the vehicle  of a group of alien-hunter/discoverers in space.<br />
    <br />
Literally everything from the double-intro to the theme song, to the narrated intro, to the antagonists (Dr. Geb and his questionably effective planning/execution), to the episodic nature of the Dandy universe makes this a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review154089">
        superlative enjoyment for anyone who enjoys anime and doesn&#039;t take it too seriously. If you can laugh at yourself and delight in the subversion of expectation, Space Dandy is for you. <br />
  <br />
The most recent episode aired last night and lampooned not only high-school based anime, but the High School Musical craze as well as a few other common thematic elements from high school anime that I won&#039;t go in to so as to avoid spoilers.<br />
   <br />
But seriously, if the idea of following around Space Dandy, and his brave space crew...in space! makes you happy or seems interesting, you owe it to yourself and your eyeballs to check it out

    If there’s a show that can make you go “WHAT?” Space Dandy would be one of the first to come to mind. The ‘what’ doesn’t associate with a kind of reaction that’s negative though. Rather, I see Space Dandy a show of creative anthology. Each episode takes the characters on a wild ride in space with Dandy doing his usual gags. While the show often goes wacky with its direction, it’s safe to say that the real point of the Space Dandy focuses on much more. Space Dandy Season 2 returns with Dandy and his adventurous crew in this sequel. And seriously, this show craves

          <span style="display: none;" id="review164957">
        for attention when it comes to imaginative endeavors. <br />
<br />
Directed by the brainchild of Cowboy Bebop, Shinichiro Watanabe once again proves his worth. Breaking down the boundary of the adventure theme, he takes this sequel to new heights with his creativity. It quickly makes its point with the first episode by adapting various references and explodes them onto the screen. The comedic nature of the show quickly takes command but also fits in various satires and gags to illustrate creativity. As daring as the first season, it’s not afraid to pull off risks. The risk here is that episodes can come with a mixed bag. But really, Space Dandy was never a show about overly complex plot angles or some dynamic narrative. Rather, it keeps the space adventure zipping along that is mastered with uniqueness.<br />
<br />
Stuffed with craziness, the show plays around with itself like it’s in a class of its own. Make no mistake though, Dandy plays more than just the role of a professor as he takes on the good adventure with his crew members. Essentially, the show was about hunting down aliens as Dandy dedicates it as his job. However, many episodes explores more than just that cliché. Comedy first, and space adventure second is probably the better way to say it in this case. Space Dandy has been defined as a show that is free to do whatever it wants. There’s no boundary that confines itself or limit its ideas. Most of the episodes takes in space but also seizes opportunities to expand its settings. These include but not limited to high school, a mystical lake, and even a world where there’s no sadness. (literally, as that title implies). Regardless, the main objective that Space Dandy achieves is not an adventure of classic fun but rather inspiration, the way it presents its stylish blockbuster hit from where season 1 already built upon.<br />
<br />
A majority of the attention is focused on the main characters. In fact, the main characters has this connection with both each other and I dare say…the audience. Dandy has this personality that is like a chemistry set for a scientist. Once they get their hands on it, they can’t stop. Their curiosity takes them like the way Dandy takes his adventures to wonders of the universe. This sense of nature can even label him as a hero as Dandy has prevented tragedies and even entire galactic wars in one of the episodes in this season. On the other hand, Dandy’s two sidekicks QT and Meow play some major roles as well in the sequel. Unlike most series that tries to succeed with ‘beating the Big Bad to save the world’, Space Dandy is more about achieving some goal. It focuses on what the premise of each episode and twists in a ways beyond incalculable imaginations. Some of them will make your mind go “WHAT?” while other times will bring a smile of appreciation. It shouldn’t be any surprising though. The sequel doesn’t derive far from the style of season 1. Each episode is carefully crafted with its main and supporting characters to fit with its creative context. The catch is also that the show isn’t exactly like a ‘monster of the week’ program. Instead, it seeks ambition and articulate concepts beyond just the space tropes. However, it can sometimes be frustrating to realize that most characters seize to appear in the future and only opt to play their roles in that specifically dedicated episode.<br />
<br />
To take for granted, various themes play along the show as if it’s self-aware. Destiny is one such theme as Dandy often seemingly gets himself involved with circumstances beyond his control. They say fate and destiny is something people can’t defy. In Space Dandy though, that’s a different story as Dandy often tries to tempt fate. His various battles such as against aliens, monstrous fishes, and armed forces often puts Dandy’s own life in jeopardy. Yet, somehow Dandy pulls off a spectacular show when it’s put up or shut up time. It’s not clearly defined as deus ex machina because like I mentioned before, the show is seemingly self-aware about what Dandy is capable of. The sequel takes even more daring risks with imaginative worlds. One such episode really takes the cake with Dandy being in a world where sadness and death itself is extinct. The avant-garde nature combined with its unique humor of each episode brings forward talent on the tables as well. Each episode has a different screen writer including Watanabe himself. I give praise to Kiyotaka Oshiyama and Masaaki Yuasa for their stylish and clever writing. More so, Watanabe shows his skills in coordination by deconstructing the essence of an adventure. The sequel takes its adventure far beyond just space and into scenarios that not even the Twilight Zone can see with its eyes.<br />
<br />
Production quality generally remains the same with Bones in charge of the operation. Character designs are still like the previous season with not much difference. There are some particular episodes that Dandy has slight differences to reflect the nature of itself. Otherwise, character designs still reflect the sci-fi trope such as the aliens, space vehicles, and fabulous gentlemen of the universe. One thing I find season 2 masterfully done is how artwork sells what it tries to advertise. The preview of each episode only produces an initial impression with the title being a potential trademark. However, the execution can really knock an audience off-guard with its contrasting visuals. Episodes directed by Watanabe and Yuasa are prominent examples for this. <br />
<br />
Soundtrack is more of a classic appreciation. The western style OST fused with sci-fi tones is something to take notice of. The soothing music, the elegance of the OST, and colorful edginess clarify what this season is trying to accomplish. Surprisingly enough, I find the dubs comparable to the original Japanese versions. In both instances, Dandy has a voice of an explorer and takes on adventures with enthusiasm. Other characters too have influences whether they are human, robots, or aliens. One particular episode even has references to the voice actor with his own character (DUB version) and a classic battle of the bands theme. The OP and ED songs remain generally the same for the sequel though. <br />
<br />
There’s no single word to describe the second season. It can be fun, sexy, entertaining, insightful, influential, creative, thrilling, formulaic, intelligent, sensitive, charming, or just dandy. Some episodes can also be deep with hidden meanings and evoke emotions. Each episode is filled with potential and explores space like an anthology. Yes, the series may not make sense at times and will leave you in the hanging. Yes, the sequel may have never solved a story subplot or context that should have been. However, does it really need to? Remember, the show doesn’t limit itself with its adventures. It stretches beyond the boundary of imagination by indulging on its unorthodox or perhaps even radical style. In the end, you might ask yourself “what the hell?” I know I did but doesn’t regret a single minute afterwards. <br />

    Space Dandy is unique, it is a huge bag filled with endless creativity, it is fun, it is trippy, it is superb. Season 1 is good but there are several episodes that are a hit or miss, however, season 2 is awesome, much better than the first.<br />
<br />
STORY: 9/10<br />
Story? What story? Technically, the universe of Space Dandy is so vast that the creators can concoct any story and it will still make perfect sense. Space Dandy is an episodic anime, with the episodes differing A LOT from each other, this is mostly due to the fact that Space Dandy is directed by multiple directors, each bringing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review163513">
        their own flair and style into the episode they directed, which is why I said this is a huge bag filled with endless creativity, because it is!<br />
<br />
There isn’t any continuity between the episodes, as such you are free to watch the episodes separately and still enjoy it as a whole. Dandy and his co may die in one episode, and appear perfectly fine in the next, and this fact, supposedly established in the very first episode of season 1, is actually explained brilliantly towards the end of the series (hence my high score).<br />
<br />
ART: 10/10<br />
Hands down, Space Dandy is one of the most beautiful animes I’ve ever seen in my life. Remember when I mentioned the episodes differ a lot from each other? This applies to the art as well! Each and every single episode are drawn in a different style and this gives us viewers a myriad of eye candies to watch for (that ancient Japanese artstyle in ep 5? Wow). Not to mention the jaw-dropping sceneries found in many parts of the show, my eyes were glued to the screen at all times. <br />
<br />
SOUNDS: 10/10<br />
Space Dandy wouldn’t be the same without the awesome soundtrack behind it. Most of the soundtracks are funk and jazz music (dandy!), of course there are plenty of other genres as well, heck, we even have live rock music (ep 7), high school musical style (ep 4), disco music from the 80s (ep 9) and many more. This season of Space Dandy had really upped the ante especially on this area, so pay attention to it as well when you watch it. <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 8/10<br />
Sadly, this season has more episodes of Dandy being isolated from QT and Meow, so we don’t see much of them as compared to the first season. Anyhow, Dandy is as cool as ever, and this coolness escalates to a much higher level especially towards the finale. Scarlet and Honey gets more screentime as well and they will be featured much, much more than just at their respective workplaces. Dr Gel and Bea are also featured as recurrent villains, and towards the finale, there’s a big surprise waiting…<br />
<br />
We also have a huge cast of new characters joining in, with my favourites being Johnny and Planet Limbo herself. See for yourself and you will as well, I am sure, love the characters in Space Dandy. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 9/10<br />
Granted, due to the episodic nature of Space Dandy, episodes may be a hit or miss, subjective to the viewer him/herself. If you ask me, I fell in love with most of the episodes of this season compared to the last season, and this season has many episodes with very high rewatchability, either to marvel at the greatness of the art, or the gorgeous soundtrack, or the mightily creative story and characters. <br />
<br />
OVERALL: 9/10<br />
I’d reckon that Space Dandy is viewable for all ages, but is especially appealing to the adults. Space Dandy should become more enjoyable as you age, due to the wide range of pop culture references in it. In conclusion, Space Dandy is a clever anime, and a brilliant work of art. <br />

    *Note: This review is about the series in general, not just Season 2*<br />
<br />
Boobies and butts are what make the universe a pretty awesome place to exist in. How is this so? Just ask Dandy himself, and he could tell you all about it in glorious enthusiasm. This Dandy I speak of is named Space Dandy. Imagine if you mixed the best of western and eastern humor of TV animation shows and combine them into one nifty package. That should tell you right away that Space Dandy destines to be different and fresh without making an overtly big deal about it. Regardless, you certainly can’t beat

          <span style="display: none;" id="review167189">
        this hot fun garbage series with any other garbage entertainment, anime or otherwise.<br />
<br />
It should be noted, when talking about Space Dandy, that this is not a Shinichiro Watanabe directed anime in its purest sense, the director of such classics as Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Even though he overseas chief direction for the show, this is essentially a conglomerate of different anime directors putting their own directorial spin on the series. That should tell you right there that Space Dandy does not follow any direct narrative from point A to point B. Episodic episodes spliced together to follow Dandy and his band of various misfits, all create a western-style animated series vibe that can be nostalgic for those of us growing up as kids watching these shows day by day. So if you thought this was going to be a Cowboy Bebop-style show, just be thankful that you will be getting the filler episode portions of Bebop.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, that should not entail that Space Dandy is nothing more than a comedic version of Bebop. In actuality, it brings forth a very unique style of its own to formulate charm to its humor and characters. Almost all jokes prevalent in Space Dandy hit all of the notes perfectly with nicely done comedic timing and on top of it, they don’t just make all of the jokes onto one subject matter. Sure, the main focus of Space Dandy’s comedy is purely sexual with its constant pandering over butts and boobs, but once you further yourself into the show, you’ll realize that it is not the case. Many tropes are satirized from what you would typically see in any animated show with male characters like Dandy; always getting what he wants in the end that quickly falls flat over him.<br />
<br />
There are genuine surprises thrown in here and there. For instance, it is probably one of the few anime you will ever see that has its own musical number. Even with its comedy, the writers actually delve into introspective subject matter that actually become insightful and melancholic while still maintaining its humor without exemplifying it unnaturally. Rarely would I ever applaud a show for being able to achieve both of these elements. The reason being is how the jokes are written in very clever fashion by its intricate pacing and punchlines. Never is there a dull moment between the hilarious banter of Dandy and his friends out of the 26 episodes in this series.<br />
<br />
Dandy himself is quite the protagonist in keeping the show at an evenly paced comedy with his larger than life charisma and presence. Normally with a man who constantly obsesses over booty and tits can be grating over a period of time. What makes Dandy an exception is that they do not really shove the obvious joke down our throats continuously, although in some parts they do, especially in the earlier episodes. He proves himself to be an exceptional lead, but that’s not to say he’s the only one who is able to do that in Space Dandy.<br />
<br />
Meow, Dandy’s right hand man after humiliating him in the first episode, isn’t similar to Dandy in terms of personality. In fact, Meow would be the one to set him straight to focus on their missions, even though Dandy himself isn’t a total idiot in most cases. QT, Dandy’s robot sidekick, is the same way in this aspect, where he is always trying to keep things in order over Dandy’s typical behavior. Both of these leads are extremely lovable because of the perfect chemistry between them and Dandy. Even when their relationship seems atypical, goofy trite at first glance, they eventually warm up to being match made in heaven.<br />
<br />
What good is it to talk about Space Dandy without mentioning its elaborate music? Absolutely zilch. I will speak in no hyperbole whatsoever in stating that Space Dandy has the most infectious Opening I’ve had the pleasure of listening to. The word infectious is meant in the most positive sense possible. Newcomer Kensuke Ushio has really made himself quite a success story in 2014 with this and also composing for Ping Pong The Animation. The opening itself sets the mood for the entire show and lets you know that fun is about to come your way, like any other good opening does to any other show.<br />
<br />
One very important thing to note is the artistic direction and how diverse the animators decided to put into creating this very elaborate, kooky universe. All of the alien creatures are very unique in design that are a mix mash of previously imagined aliens and putting in their own vision. The lavish colors are put with great care so Space Dandy can be easy and pleasing to the eyes. It also helps that the animation is nice and fluid to further the aesthetic to new heights. Also, because there are multiple directors for each episode, some of them even put their own artistic vision into the spectrum. One notable is Masaaki Yuasa, director of The Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong The Animation, who filled in one episode for animation direct in episode 3, who managed to put in a whole different spin for the series in terms of animation.<br />
<br />
In closing, there is really nothing like Space Dandy that you often see in anime. In some ways, it’s sort of Japan’s answer to western animated TV shows and saying, “Hey, we can make episodic goofy comedies just like the rest of y’all!” Regardless of whether that was their true intention or not, it definitely speaks volumes by analyzing how Space Dandy can work both as a satire or a genuine comedy. Japanese anime purists may watch this with disdain because its not the archetypal anime, even in comedy standards, that we are used to. But if you’re willing to give credit where credit is due for a Japan-produced nostalgia trip of late-’90s to early 2000’s animated shows, look no further.<br />

    This is more of the stuff you saw in the first season. The animation is still great, music is still good, but for some reason I enjoyed this season less than the 1st one. <br />
<br />
For some reason the stories in individual episodes, despite looking good graphically in most cases failed to resonate with me and left less impact than, for example, the absolutely amazing &quot;plant episode&quot; from the first season of space dandy. I&#039;m not sure why this happened.<br />
<br />
It is still worth watching, mostly because of high quality animation, and because of unusual stories, but expect it to have less impact than the first season.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263119">
        At least the way it worked for me.<br />
<br />
Detailed breakdown below:<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10.<br />
As I said, most of the episodes failed to properly resonate with me and I found some of them very dull, desptie amazing artwork. However, now and then there are sparks of amazing, that was present in the original 1st season. There&#039;s smaller degree of &quot;weird alienness&quot;, smaller number of weird worlds and strange stories, but now and then the story does make an interesting point or two, that makes you stop and think.<br />
<br />
Still.. I felt like this anime could use a much better scriptwriter. Much better one.<br />
<br />
One thing worth mentioning is that there&#039;s a very subtle headscratcher in this series that reminded me of Rick and Morty. It is very easy to miss.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10:<br />
Very high quality fluid animation. However, this time around there were several occurrences where I noticed footage reuse and &quot;panning shots&quot; (someone talks in small number of frames and the camera slowly pans acros the scene). This is usually used to reduce animation costs, and I do not recall this happening in the 1st season. However, the anime never goes overboard with it, and still looks good.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10:<br />
IT is good/catchy, however, in a few circumstances where music was supposed to take the lead, it failed to deliver. Basically, music is mostly good, but I couldn&#039;t call it &quot;great&quot;. It does its job. Still, it is of higher quality than in many other animes.<br />
<br />
Character: 5/10:<br />
Characters lack depth and fails to deliverer in circumstances where story tries to portray them as deep/complex personalities. This is not surprising, because everybody is technically a stereotype/caricature and the show is usually about portraying some weird situation, world or planet, but at the end of the anime, it is not possible to say much about characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyement: 6/10:<br />
I found two episodes dull. The rest was okay. There was a small number of interesting headscratcher in the show, but despite high quality animation by studio bones, I wouldn&#039;t call this a masterpiece. Bones developed many other titles that were superior to this one (RahXephon, for example).<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10:<br />
The anime has good animation and is worth because of it. However, I felt like the show desperately needed a better scriptwriter, and failed to deliver its full potential because of it. The artwork is very good, however.<br />
<br />
It is wroth checking out, and is recommended in case you wanted to check out high quality visuals and fluid animation.<br />

    Its a Space Dandy review, Baby.<br />
<br />
Ill start this off by saying that this show took a quite unexpected leap forward during its second season. Space Dandy part 2 focused on some pretty deep questions, and our loveable oaf dandy turns about to be quite the philosopher.<br />
<br />
Story 10/10<br />
<br />
The one key element that a show needs is unpredictability. Many shows have well thought-out stories with coherent back stories and a good progression. Space Dandy has somehow succeeded in showing the complete opposite of this. The episode to episode chronology is nearly inconsistent (although this is later explained), and this makes every new episode a new adventure. <br />
<br />
Part

          <span style="display: none;" id="review164683">
        of the reason for Space Dandy&#039;s remarkable story was due to the multitude of directors and writers working on the show, each one bringing their own style to the show. The most profound episodes are written by none other than Shinichiro Watanabe. After so many predictable shows with careful a planning, Space Dandy stands out from the crowd.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art 9/10<br />
<br />
The art of Space Dandy pays homage to earlier 90s sci-fi shows, such as Cowboy Bebop and Cyber City Oedo: yet throws in a bit of flair with bright colour pallets. Everything from the Aloha Oe to Dandy&#039;s pompadour has an aura of rebelliousness  which perfectly fits the theme of the show.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10<br />
<br />
On inspection of the 2 Dandy OSTs, it is clear that Space Dandy uses a wide range of genres to create the scenes. From jazz reminiscent of Bebop, to acoustic and piano singles that create a melancholic atmosphere: Space Dandy has it all.<br />
<br />
Characters 9/10<br />
<br />
Although many characters stay true to their original personas, their is a great deal of development for the main cast.<br />
<br />
QTs romance at the end of season 1; Meow&#039;s family episode, Scarlet&#039;s inner feelings and Dandy&#039;s constant desire to help those in need all show a level of depth I never expected from this show. While Dandy may appear a lustful clueless oaf to the new viewer, we are slowly shown a far more profound side to him: with each episode bringing to light another side to out multi-dimensional hero<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
<br />
What more is there to say, baby. You would be hard pressed to find anyone who didn&#039;t enjoy Space Dandy. The strong following is proof enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall space dandy is a testament to what is possible if writers, directors and animators are given creative freedom. Space Dandy was not designed to sell, nor was it designed to pander to a particular audience. In essence, Space Dandy is proof that you don&#039;t need perfect animation, coherent plots or a specific audience to make a great show.<br />
<br />
Watch space dandy: you&#039;ll be surprised.

    Space Dandy 2 - 7/10<br />
<br />
Space Dandy, is a Dandy in Space, brought to you by the creator of Cowboy Bebop, Shinchiro Watanabe.<br />
Same as the first season, but in a very different ratio, before it was funny&gt;trippy&gt;story, now it is trippy&gt;story&gt;funny, but it&#039;s still just as good, hell in some ways much better, as each episode has a very unique feeling to it, being trippy and just outright weird, while still being fun to watch with some hillarious moments and various media references.<br />
The story takes a little more time here, especially the last episode, but it&#039;s there to bring closure and explain the whole concept of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review183805">
        Space Dandy and why sometimes he would die at the end of an episode.<br />
It&#039;s a good, maybe unnecessary but still a good addition.<br />
I feel like this one i enjoyed a bit more, but it also had a lot more boring moments to it.<br />
Even though both the seasons were 8/10 i think 2nd season is my favourite out of the two.

    This show is pretty damn dandy hahaha.<br />
The story is very good, each episode is creative and fun. 8/10<br />
Art is very smooth and crisp, I watched in 1080p 60fps 144hertz UHD so I can say that for sure! 10/10<br />
The soundtrack is nice, all the music fits perfectly every time. 10/10<br />
Characters are great, I like Dandy as a chill space dude, Meow the cat is bearable, QT is a monotonous robot that has quite the personality for being a freaking robot.  Everybody else is fine I guess. 10/10<br />
I enjoyed it very much, overall pleasant experience. 10/10 overall.<br />

I&#039;m not gonna waste your time with pretentious bullshit. I loved this anime, and it&#039;s real real fun. If you try to watch this anime like an Evangelion fan, you will not have a good time. There is no story until the very end, and all the ridiculous stuff the crew does almost makes no sense at all. All the characters are great and aren&#039;t as flat as you would think, and every episode is a new fresh idea with a usually brilliant soundtrack and beautiful art piece that graces your eyes. While I can agree there are a few episodes skip-worthy,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403816">
        that&#039;ll happen when every single episode has a completely different story. You can&#039;t possibly enjoy ALL types of stories! Unless you do, then my bad. Anyways something about the show, about Dandy, makes me love it unconditionally and that&#039;s all I can say about it.

    An outrageously fun, hilarious sci-fi with a lovable crew and their bizarre space adventures. <br />
<br />
★★★★<br />
<br />
(This review covers both seasons.)<br />
<br />
Space Dandy was the most fun anime I’ve seen in a long, long time. It’s been a while since I’ve been so motivated to marathon a show. I finished the 26 episodes in 3 days. It’s hilarious, always leaving me with a smile. The characters are very charming and loveable. The plots are absurd and over-the-top, but even through the silliness it manages to settle down sometimes to make you feel at peace, even melancholy and lonely.<br />
<br />
I’ve said before, but entertainment—no matter what form—whether it’s anime or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review177531">
        movies or books are really just about giving you that emotional experience. Don’t worry about the details. Don’t worry about the logic. If you love it enough just go with it.<br />
<br />
First, the animation is absolutely amazing. It’s so full of life and details it&#039;s worth re-watching. This is a show that demands to be seen in true Blu-ray quality. You would be hurting yourself to watch it any other way. You have to see this in full 1080p to experience the incredible imagination. There are bizarre aliens, exotic planets, and beautiful cosmic scenery to witness.<br />
<br />
The show is about a crew of three and their space adventures trying to find and capture rare aliens. These aliens are then registered for a cash reward. Your hero is a care-free slacker who loves women and going to a space Hooters. At his side is an adorable, outdated vacuum cleaning robot that puts up with him. Then there’s a space cat that’s just as lazy.<br />
<br />
The dub and its writing are fantastic. I strongly recommend watching that version. It’s obvious the translation team took liberties to westernize the material, but it’s very well-suited. If I didn’t know this was an anime, I’d swear it was western made because so much of the humor feels western. Even the dialogue feels very modern with slang like “sketchy” and references to Twitter.<br />
<br />
Every episode is something different because they each have a very strong emotional theme. There’s a lot of variety to the plots. Everything from a zombie episode; a galactic space race; going on a date; meeting parallel dimensions; even something as simple as a road trip. There’s even touches of continuity as the they refer back to older plots and items. When the show takes a break from its wacky adventures to settle down the music really adds a surreal, distant, almost lonely mood. Other times the episodes are just plain weird and abstract.<br />
<br />
I’m reminded of Futurama: another sci-fi show that makes stories and jokes out of scientific concepts. Space Dandy was a blast to watch. It&#039;s like no other anime I can think of. Without a doubt it&#039;s my favorite of 2014.

    To start off, I decided to write this review when I saw current reviews with misleading information about the show. This isn&#039;t a show that will force you to think deeper, because you don&#039;t need to to enjoy it, however, it does extend a hand to those who do wish to find the deeper meaning. One of the things that makes this show so unique, is it&#039;s unwillingness to be controlled by the status quo of an anime. Our &quot;Hero&quot; is indeed a hero, but not one of traditional nature. He comes across as more of a human and ordinary guy because that&#039;s exactly what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180253">
        he is. In most shows, whether you know it or not, the &quot;hero&quot; has extraordinary luck and it allows the plot to progress further because of all the amazing opportunities they are given to show off their skills. Space Dandy, is not bound by such luck and therefor requires a lot more work to develop his character. The more you watch the more you can feel for and relate to Dandy and his issues.<br />
<br />
Now to talk about the other characters, QT and Meow. These are the supporting actors that really make this show something else. They aren&#039;t overly cliched and overdone characters, though I was worried QT was going to be the overdone calculated and boring robot. However, I was wrong. Each character has their own incredibly unique personality. Meow is probably one of the more relatable characters, he&#039;s a dropout and though his family loves him very much, he still doesn&#039;t feel content with being nothing whether he knows it or not. QT is Dandy&#039;s handy vacuum AI that helps him with a lot more than what he was programmed for and secretly harboring lots of different emotions, and that&#039;s one of the things that makes this show so beautiful, ANYBODY could be apart of Space Dandy&#039;s crew, because the characters, while having great personality, are mundane and ones that relate more to the viewer. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not going to spoil the show for you, but while every episode seems disconnected, in the end it brings it all together and explains the randomness of the show. At first I had a hard time watching space Dandy because I asked myself &quot;What&#039;s the point? The end result can&#039;t make me feel anything more than the first episode did because the plot doesn&#039;t really progress.&quot; Now here I am, writing my first anime review on what I believe to be one of the greatest plotless masterpieces around today.

    In the end we even got a Big Bang.<br />
<br />
Is the Doctor Who of anime a good anime? Yes.<br />
<br />
I am not going to waste time writing a synopsis, summary or any other time wasting bullshit. I am simply going to tell you why this anime is fabulous.<br />
<br />
Space Dandy is a concoction of episodes directed by many, many different episode directors under, I assume, the watchful eye of one of my personal heroes in the anime industry.<br />
<br />
What we have in Space Dandy that makes it fabulous is organised chaos. Some rules and cliches have been followed but not many. This makes it an anime that asks things

          <span style="display: none;" id="review172811">
        of the viewers. It asks us to beat with it. It asks us to be forgiving. It asks us to be understanding. Most of the time though, it just wants us to go with the flow. Because of this some of the episodes are not going to speak to everyone and others are not going to be understood by everyone. But this is always the risk with an anime in this format.<br />
<br />
What we do have though, is the femme fatale(s), the trusted companions, the anti-heroes (of which the main protagonist is included most of the time), some GAR, time and space travelling, some multidimensional space-time theories, zombies, plants, cyberpunk, western inspired themes, boobs, robots, a rock-band, warring space opera empires and many other things including but not excluded to space travelling fish.<br />
<br />
Something that is very important for the enjoyment of an episodic anime is the character development of side characters. You have to be fast if you want your viewer to get involved and engaged in a character which, more than likely, will not be around again. Space Dandy succeeds in this, which is one of the main reasons why it is good. Scenarios are painted up for us involving characters that&#039;s been on screen for 10 minutes and I actually cared about what was going to happen to them. That&#039;s a pretty rare feat. when it comes to me.<br />
<br />
Good bye.<br />

    comic space opera in which a trio of protagonists bounces through a series of loosely connected adventures on alien planets; as a protagonist, Dandy is not that easy to like, and the decision to open up the anime to many guest directors means unevenness - many episodes come off as lazy on the part of everyone but the dub voice actors and animators, the latter of which do an especially good job of doubling down on colors and action sakuga. (Both aspects are apparent as early as episode 1: totally lame plot and characters, great animation.) Some episodes are failures (I was particularly disappointed by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184513">
        episode 25, which seemed like it might be developing into a cool mystery, only for it turn out out to be multiple deus ex machinas.) Still, some episodes are well worth watching, perhaps more than once, with a noticeable improvement in season 2: episode 2, &quot;The Search for the Phantom Space Ramen&quot;; episode 4, &quot;Sometimes You Can&#039;t Live with Dying&quot; (an amusing zombie utopia); episode 9, &quot;Plants Are Living Things, Too&quot; (extremely questionable ethics aside); episode 10, &quot;There&#039;s Always Tomorrow&quot; (Meow, surprisingly, winds up being the best characterized person in the whole series); episode 16, &quot;Slow and Steady Wins the Race&quot; (existential risk); episode 18, &quot;The Big Fish is Huge&quot; (Ghibliesque); episode 21, &quot;A World with No Sadness&quot; (meditative death dream sequence with surreal Italian Renaissancesque worldbuilding set to progressive rock pieces by OGRE YOU ASSHOLE); and episode 24, &quot;An Other-Dimensional Tale&quot; (_Flatland_, and the secret of FTL travel in a multiverse).

    This is my first review and I&#039;m not really good at writing but I enjoyed the show and wanted to review it.<br />
<br />
So, Space Dandy &quot;Season 2&quot;. I didn&#039;t really have any expectations for this show because Season 1 disappointed me a bit just because my hype was so high for it. There were some enjoyable episodes but overall, Season 1 was a good show, and that&#039;s about it. However, after I got used to the formula of the show, Season 2 was very entertaining.<br />
<br />
There really isn&#039;t any story to Space Dandy, everything is different every week and the stories range from making a band to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review162725">
        going to a musical high school and other various random things. I actually loved this format, because getting something new each week was great. If you are looking for something like Cowboy Bebop just because of the Watanabe name, you will be disappointed. And I am assuming that&#039;s why so many people disliked this show, or rather, was disappointed with it. <br />
<br />
The art for this show is amazing. There were different directors throughout the entire show and a lot of episodes looked completely different from each other. This is great, as sometimes an episode needs to look completely different because of the tone/theme of the episode and it works, most of the time. I can also talk about the animation here, in which Bones did an amazing job. Even with the episodes where you can tell that they are saving budget, it looks great.<br />
<br />
Dandy was the center of this show. Without Dandy being an amazing character, the show would fall on its face. Sinclair did a great job voicing him, and Dandy&#039;s mannerisms and how he acted really made the show for me. I didn&#039;t really have any problems with the supporting characters like Meow, QT and Honey, but I loved Scarlet and the episode dedicated to her and Dandy was great. <br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed the show more compared to last &quot;season&quot;, and if you like episodic shows you should like this show. If there were .5s on MAL I would give it a 7.5, though. <br />

    First Review, be gentle guise.<br />
<br />
Space Dandy is a really unique series, coming from the creators of Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop, it indeed is a wacky and amazing series. It&#039;s also one of those rare series where I enjoyed the Dub more than the Sub.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
<br />
The story tends to change with each episode, each episode following a bizarre story. It&#039;s either getting chased by booby monsters or getting stuck in an island with a weird guy with a ukulele. The stories weren&#039;t bad at all and I found myself laughing at the end of each episode. If the stories followed a concrete storyline with no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186591">
        changes, maybe this would be higher on my list but I suppose these crazy story lines are what make Space Dandy... Dandy?<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
<br />
Oh boy, the art in some/most of these episodes were amazing. There were some episodes where the studio experimented with different styles but still, those experiments were very enjoyable to watch. There were these two particular episodes (The Limbo and the fishing one, won&#039;t go into too much detail or I&#039;ll be entering Spoiler zone) where the animation was top notch. They really were a treat for the eyes.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
The music here is just...perfect for the series. The Funky/Jazzy soundtrack was very enjoyable and were just a perfect choice for this kind of sci-fi theme. The soundtrack really enhanced the experience and is one of the main reasons why Space Dandy got such a high rating from me.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
<br />
If felt as if the ending was a bit rushed for me however it still was one hell of a dandy ride. An amazing series.

    Space Dandy was created by the same people who brought you Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop, legendary anime known for their great storytelling and stunning visuals, so what makes Space Dandy so special? Well it should be noted, he&#039;s a dandy guy in space with a great story to tell.  The episodes seem a bit random but really piece together in the end, Space Dandy season 2 really brings together the entire feel of adventure you get from season 1, it has great storytelling and is in all entertaining.  Critiques to keep in mind however, the ending is full of crap, not really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185981">
        a spoiler, more of a warning.  You really get attached to the story and art of the show, sometimes an episode can get you confused, but in the end you&#039;ll really miss the journey you went through with the Dandy Space Crew.  Truly an anime worth watching, and one of the few where the dubbed and subbed are as equally good, so watching either is great.  <br />
For some more in-depth, first we can start with story: the story is a jumbled just like the first season but the seemingly random plotline is what really makes the story great, especially with all the butts and boobies to gawk at on the way.  The art is just stunning, the animation itself is outstanding and in few episodes you&#039;ll have to pause just to admire the quality of both character design and background art.  The sound and music of the show is great, it has great music to listen and gives a sense of awe.  The character development of the anime.........isn&#039;t that well done.  Keep in mind they can travel in space! They aren&#039;t off to see the same person all the time! However, you get a sense the characters never really change purely because the gang continues to move around everywhere, leaving loose ends everywhere such as Scarlett&#039;s and Dandy&#039;s relationship or Honey and her brothers true nature.  Personal enjoyment is truly a 10, the anime is phenomenal in the sense of entertainment!  Overall it&#039;d deserve a 9, being a great anime to remember and watch when you want another adventure, but not one with complex storylines or anything serious, something just to sit back and relax, laugh and cry a bit, definitely a 9/10.

    (7.5/10)<br />
<br />
So I don&#039;t really have much to say about the second season of Space Dandy. It pretty much maintained what I really enjoyed about the first season, as well as the parts that I didn&#039;t really enjoy. It&#039;s still a very inconsistent show, with three episodes this second seasons that were especially unfun to watch. <br />
<br />
At its worst it&#039;s a middling, dull knockoff trying to parody shit that has already been endlessly parodied by other programs. It comes off as cliche and lazy. At it&#039;s best it&#039;s a genre mixing masterwork of jaw-dropping animation, great short-form storytelling, and engaging characters. <br />
<br />
In season 2 there was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review235087">
        an odd focus on music in a few episodes which really just didn&#039;t sound too good. A high-school musical-esq episode that, while it may make sense on paper, really didn&#039;t translate on screen. They parodied a lot of those cliches that come with that kind of genre, but didn&#039;t really do so in an interesting enough way to get me to be engaged with it. That mixed in with truly mediocre songwriting didn&#039;t do the show any favors. <br />
<br />
In this season, though, there was a distinct focus on the endgame, too. Which was surprising. It&#039;s a show that can be made infinitely, so it takes a lot of guts (and balls) from Watanabe and Minami for not milking it for all it&#039;s worth. It fits better as a 2-core. It looks more appealing as a short-lived, but very fun show. <br />
<br />
________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
The series finale, all spoilers aside, shows a show that knows itself. More importantly, it shows a creator and writer that knows the show. He knows exactly what the show is and what it is aiming to be. Mixing absolutely insane spectacle, touching character moments, and obvious bathos into a very entertaining and undoubtedly awesome conclusion.<br />
<br />
The shows finale was even hinted at many times in the shows second season, with many fan theories being proven correct, which shows a longer con that the creator was playing. This is also a thumbs up. <br />
<br />
If only the show felt a bit more consistent in its delivery. I think if it weren&#039;t for the third music-oriented episode, I would have been comfortable with giving this show a great 8/10, which means it would have earned its spot as one of my favorite anime. That being said, unfortunately, for as awesome as a few key episodes were, especially the ones guest animated and directed, you simply can&#039;t forgive the blundering duds that were in the second season as well. <br />
<br />
However, certain episodes stood out as much as the specific few in season 1 as well. An episodes by the key animator for Kizumonogatari was something special, as well as episodes with big names like Kiyotaka Oshiyama, and the glorious Masaaki Yuasa, create some of the shows most memorable pieces of animation. <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Overall, the second season solidified Space Dandy as a very memorable space romp with perhaps the most charismatic and fun lead in any anime I&#039;ve ever seen. He&#039;s someone who lives by no rules other than his own. Someone who is both emotional and distant. Someone values ass and boobs above all else. <br />
<br />
He&#039;s Space Dandy, baby!

    In a few ways, it&#039;s notable improvement over the first season, but it still has many of the same issues I had with the first season.<br />
<br />
The episodic nature of the series is still here, but the tone of the episodes are much more varied this time. There also seems to be less screentime of QT and Meow and more focus on fleshing out Dandy as a character, which was a positive overall. There are also episodes that are less comedic and more introspective. These didn&#039;t always land well for me, but the change of pace was appreciated. The last episode seemed to be tying together

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350342">
        the warping storyline that&#039;s occasionally mentioned, but those bits were always too fragmented for me to understand and follow.<br />
<br />
The production value of Space Dandy is still impressive, most of what I said about the first season still applies. Colors seemed more vibrant at times, but I think that&#039;s mostly due to the content of certain episodes.<br />
<br />
While season 2 was a step up over the first in my opinion, I still found it unenjoyable overall. The larger focus Dandy is a positive when the alternatives are Meow and QT, but I still found Dandy to be too one-dimensional to carry a show for 13 episodes.

    This show has a fun and enjoyable vibe it constantly gives off. The show is playful and silly and shows it often. The plots for the episodic series are enjoyable, and are similar to the first season. The shows ends in a strange yet very &#039;Dandy&#039; way. The characters act the exact same way from the first season, so it won&#039;t be too hard to carry on with the same enjoyment as you may have had in the first season. They introduce a new character, whose role is minor yet at the same time a little important. Then the show all comes down to a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201726">
        pretty odd ending, which like I said earlier fits with the show. I would have changed the way it ended though, the ending they gave the show just doesn&#039;t really fit the mood for the rest of the series. I would rate 10 but emotions aside from how fantastic the show is, I give it a 9 for a weirdly &#039;rushed&#039; ending.

    ATTENTION! THIS IS A REVIEW FOR BOTH SEASONS SINCE I WATCHED BOTH OF THEM BACK-TO-BACK AND THINK THIS IS THE WAY THE ANIME SHOULD BE WATCHED TO GET THE MOST ENJOYMENT OUT OF IT<br />
<br />
THERE ARE MAJOR PLOT POINTS SPOILERS BECAUSE THE STORY DOESN&#039;T POINT IT OUT IN AN OBVIOUS WAY! THEY ARE MARKED BUT BE WARNED!<br />
<br />
So, here I&#039;m back from watching the two seasons to finally give my opinion of the show. I first thought it would be just an episodic acid trip show coupled with lots of Gundam, the 80s, and pop culture references. Boy, was I wrong!<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the thing. Is Space Dandy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342169">
        an episodic anime with no continuity or determined plot? Yes (Dandy is a space hunter looking for unknown alien races in return of making a good profit, he is not that good while doing his job. But he is Dandy while doing it!) and No. <br />
<br />
[SPOILERS START HERE]<br />
If you pay attention to all the episodes&#039; undertones and vague dialogue sequences between The Gogol Empire Admiral Perry (Space Skeleton looking thing) and Dr. Gel (Gorilla Doctor) there is a reason why they are looking to capture Dandy for their purposes to tip the power scale of the war between the Gogol Empire and the Jaicro Empire. It&#039;s stated multiple times that Dandy has (for a mysterious and unknown reason until chapter 8 of season 2) some energy inside him that can make all the difference and help the Gogol Empire to win the war.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is this energy and plot McGuffin thing about Dandy? To explain in simple terms, Dandy is special since he is the main character. Did you notice that in some episodes Dandy and the crew simply die in some space catastrophe but in the next episode everything is back to normal? Yes, it was not just made for comedic purposes. As the anime spouts some mumbo jumbo quantum physics terms left and right like it was nothing, it is explained in Chapter 8 of the Season 2 (which in my opinion is the best animated, best directed, and psychedelic episode of the series) that Dandy really died all those times, but even Space Death (who is a chick that falls in love with Dandy because of his visits to the space afterlife, and being the only other living being in the afterlife) can&#039;t understand because he is not actually dead and must be returned to life every time, BUT in a parallel/different universe (if you stay to listen to the ending lyrics, it states this too) as nothing had happened, and so, life for Dandy simply keeps going on. Dandy is in other terms a UNIVERSAL CONSTANT THAT NEEDS TO EXIST, so killing him is pointless as he will come back because the universe itself wants it to be that way (in other words the creators of the anime itself hehe). That&#039;s why The Gogol Empire wants Dandy and why he has this mysterious energy inside him, even though they don&#039;t really get how he got a hold on an energy of this magnitude.<br />
[SPOILERS END HERE]<br />
<br />
Oh, and a little trivia: The Gogol Empire is a parody to Google, where they have their Gogol Streetview to search for dandy throughout the Galaxy, and their catchphrase used by a Yahoo member in the forums where Meow asks a question is just &quot;Gogol it&quot;. Then, who the hell is the Jaicro Empire? It is said to be based on the JAIRO, which stands for Japanese Institutional Repositories Online. It&#039;s a web-based search interface that provides aggregated open access to Japanese academic content, including journal articles, theses, research bulletins, and reports. It is administered by Japan&#039;s National Institute of Informatics, and if my research is not mistaken, it seems it was discontinued in April of 2019.<br />
<br />
<br />
Space Dandy can be a super hit and miss comedy show (niche for a lack of better words) because it has some jokes that if you have no previous knowledge of what it&#039;s trying to parody then you will not see through it, and said jokes will become bland. I can&#039;t see my 15 or 17-year-old selves enjoying it as much as I did while I&#039;m 26. And if you never saw Watanabe&#039;s works (Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo), it probably won&#039;t have the same impact as it did to me. With all that said, it is understandable why Studio Bones had to cancel the series (which Watanabe was working on a movie for it). The show didn&#039;t turn out to be revolutionary anime they wanted to be, especially when Shonen is so strong lately and the audiences aren&#039;t interested in a more deep yet comedic anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
I give a 9/10 if you understand what is happening under the hood of the show and is familiarized with Shinichiro Watanabe&#039;s work. If not, this isn&#039;t like Rick and Morty, who has similar premises but has more crude humor to help it if the audience isn&#039;t smart or mature enough to get everything that the show wants to transmit, then it turns out to be a 7/10. For the animation, music is 10/10 (subjective), artwork, character design, it is a consistent 8/10 (the general slice of life episodes), with some 9/10 and 10/10 animation in the deeper, psychedelic episodes (the first episode, the zombie episode, the space pororoca episode, the life-death of Dandy episode, the multiverse episode, the giant fish episode, and final episodes).<br />
<br />
<br />
Give it time, but Space Dandy could get to be recognized as of the hidden gems of all anime out there. It really lives up to the quality of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, but the anime was released in a time where it won&#039;t get much traction as its predecessors got. If let us say, the anime was really today (2020), amidst all the COVID-19 pandemic and people being more at home, where introspects of life are happening more (global crises, and all), then this anime would get a lot more traction and be one of the best of the year.
