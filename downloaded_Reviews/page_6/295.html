    Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service resonates with me more than any other movie I&#039;ve seen. Filled with inspiration, warmth and tenderness, it&#039;s perhaps the best example of a coming-of-age story I&#039;ve seen in anime to date. While most Ghibli fans prefer the likes of Spirited Away or Mononoke Hime, and while I love and adore those films passionately, I personally feel that Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service is their best work, and Miyazaki&#039;s best directed film.<br />
<br />
Everything about this movie just brings me a smile and always brings me up when I feel down. What makes this movie great is that it doesn&#039;t have huge ambition; it&#039;s not here to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review170389">
        tell you about the consequences of relying too much on technology, or destroying the natural earth, confronting the spirits of the forest. Of life. But it&#039;s simply the story of a young girl coming to terms with growing up and living in an entirely new town with total strangers. Transitioning from the comfort of her quiet country side hometown, to the hustle and bustle of an urban area.<br />
<br />
Being independent for the first time is a terrifying experience for anyone, but it&#039;s also enlightening, as you can learn more about yourself and others than you thought. Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service showcases those ups and downs brilliantly. From an awkward introduction to baffled strangers on the streets, to starting her own business and befriending her clients, to meeting the owner of a Bakery who immediately shows a keen interest in the young girl, taking the role of a sort of mother figure to her. You meet all sorts of characters in this movie, all of them with an interesting or realistic characteristic. From a gruff looking, but gentle husband of the Bakery owner, to a boy who is extremely passionate about flight and aircrafts(even attempting to lodge a propeller onto his bike to try to get some air) who develops an immediate infatuation with Kiki, to a painter who takes comfort living in the middle of the woods, befriending the hordes of crows that live in it.<br />
<br />
And then there is Kiki herself; at first glance she is cheerful, if a little naive. Honest, yet surprisingly old fashioned(&quot;It&#039;s not polite to ask a persons name without introducing yourself first!&quot;). The thing I love about her character is that she&#039;s so many things, so many qualities that show how much of a varied, complex, but very realistic character she really is. She isn&#039;t a spoiled brat, she isn&#039;t selfish, she isn&#039;t annoying. She&#039;s simply a little girl with her own quirks and principles.<br />
<br />
The film showcases the joys and pains of growing up finding your place in the world. At one point, she wearily laments the fact that she doesn&#039;t have pretty dresses, and she cannot afford that sparkling pair of red shoes that she gazes at through the window of a clothes shop. She sees her friend Tombo chatting and laughing with girls, sparking an immediate sense of jealousy from Kiki due to her insecurities. <br />
<br />
She wants nice things, she wants to wear a nice dress, she wants to talk to boys and make friends. But cannot afford it, nor does she have the time. She simply desires a lot of what girls probably want at that age or slightly older. It&#039;s what makes her human and convincing as a character.<br />
<br />
Even if you&#039;re not the same age group, or even gender, I feel that a lot of us have lived through moments where we feel so unsure of ourselves, feeling a sense of loneliness and isolation in the process.<br />
<br />
And even though she goes through times of insecurity, depression and feeling like she&#039;s in a rut. She also befriends and meets many people that find her remarkably charming, sweet and sincere. She experiences friendships, success in her business and feeling accomplished.<br />
<br />
The music, composed by the master himself, Joe Hisaishi. Is nothing short of perfect, the soundtrack has a very distinct European sound to it, also induces a large sense of nostalgia. From the early 60s pop sound of the opening, to the tender folk ballad of the ending. The soundtrack compliments nearly every scene in the movie to considerable effect. As expected!<br />
<br />
The animation and designs are also incredibly top notch. It&#039;s crisp, it&#039;s clear(I just recently purchased the bluray version), it brilliantly showcases the varied areas and backgrounds. Everything is just straight up gorgeous. The town itself, Koriko, an ideal version of a pre-WWII Northern European city is one of my favorite designed places in fiction. To the hectic main-roads, the quiet alleyways and side areas you could casually stroll through, to the gorgeous beaches and scenery. It&#039;s very romantic and exhilarating. I would personally love to live in a city like this.<br />
<br />
Despite what it does right, does it do anything wrong? Well, I wouldn&#039;t have minded if the movie went a bit more into the witch culture. In the story, when 12-13, a witch must leave her town and spend a year elsewhere, growing and learning, broadening their horizons essentially. But it&#039;s not really explained too much, but this is simply a nitpick as the film is more about Kiki and her experiences than all that.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a certain warmth to this film that makes it feel like you&#039;re revisiting an old friend. I find it difficult to find any major faults in this movie. I&#039;ve grown up watching it on tv dozens of times, and later in life revisiting it, only to truly then realize how special this film is to me. I never said that I would be objective or impartial in this review, that would be pointless and a disservice to the film. Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service makes you passionate, or just really happy and relaxed, whichever works for you. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s anime like this that proves to me yet again that animation can be a wonderful expression of art. If you&#039;ve never seen this film, do yourself a favor and do so soon. Set up some free time during a quiet weekend afternoon and let yourself be enveloped in tenderness.<br />

    For my second Hayao Miyazaki movie, I&amp;rsquo;d say it was pretty good.<br />
<br />
I liked the plot of Spirited Away much, much better though. Spirited Away had a more complex and interesting plot, while Kiki&amp;rsquo;s story was simpler. I guess the advantage of that is it&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand. As much as I like stories about witches living amongst normal humans, Kiki didn&amp;rsquo;t really act or live like a witch. She was more of a human who can fly and happens to own a cat that talks. <br />
<br />
Since I brought up the subject of the talking cat, I&amp;rsquo;m glad I picked the English dub over the original

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406">
        Japanese dub. I fell in love with the cast when I saw their interviews, so I decided to go with the Disney dub.Sure it became more Disney-ish, but it was actually pretty good. I like how they made Jiji talk more &amp;ndash; I realized that in the Japanese dub Jiji wasn&amp;rsquo;t as talkative. Also, Phil Hartman made Jiji way funnier.<br />
<br />
As expected of Hayao Miyazaki, the animation was fantastic &amp;ndash; even if it was a 1989 movie. Since it&amp;rsquo;s from 1989, I&amp;rsquo;m assuming everything is hand drawn. The backgrounds were very detail, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t overwhelming. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of looking at a fine, intricate watercolor painting that moves.<br />
<br />
I did notice a lot of fan service throughout the movie. I know that seems weird, but there were numerous panty flashes from Kiki herself. I was beginning to think if that was intentional.<br />
<br />
Disney edited the music, for sure. There were poppy, contemporary songs (both by Sydney Forest) during the beginning and the ending scenes of the movie. I can&amp;rsquo;t say I like the songs that much, but they were pretty catchy. I also noticed that a lot of the original BGM was omitted &amp;ndash; I don&amp;rsquo;t know why that is. For the BGM I heard, I thought those tracks were very nice. They were easy to listen to and made the scenes especially peaceful and serene.<br />
<br />
I&amp;rsquo;m probably gonna watch it again. It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of thing that you can watch any time and you&amp;rsquo;ll never get tired of it.

    Studio Ghibli movies have always been known for being creative, visionary and imaginative, filled with so much care and heart poured into them, to the point where they become distinguishable from the medium as a whole. For several years, Miyazaki and his buddy Takahata have devoted many hours of their days to making the best of the best when it came to animated features. For Takahata, some may say that his masterpiece when it came to movies was Grave of the Fireflies, others may say that his true masterpiece was Only Yesterday. Regardless of what Takahata’s true masterpiece is, both he and Miyazaki have produced

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316965">
        many movies that have been hailed as masterpieces by many over the years, but what is Hayao Miyazaki’s masterpiece? What is his magnum opus? Many will immediately point out to the award winning, beautifully animated 2001 movie, Spirited Away. Others will point out to his famous 1997 movie, Princess Mononoke. At the end of the day, there is no right or wrong answer when it comes to what Miyazaki’s masterpiece truly is, since everyone has their own subjective opinions, and picking out the best of the best when it comes to Miyazaki is a hard chore to accomplish, especially considering all of the quality movies he’s put out during his career. Regardless of subjective opinions and differences between Ghibli fans, today we take a look at Miyazaki’s most underrated gem, his overshadowed masterpiece - Kiki’s Delivery Service. A movie that is so beautifully directed and animated, and has been undeservingly overshadowed by many other Ghibli titles that have come out since this movie’s debut.  <br />
<br />
Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service is one of the very few Ghibli movies that would make a viewer cry. Spirited Away would come close, but it wouldn’t quite hit the mark with what it offers, and wouldn’t emotionally resonate with some viewers. Kiki’s true beauty, however, lies in the fact that it is a simple movie, and any person would have come up with both the plot and the ending, but it takes a lot of care and brilliant directing to make a plot so simple shine in such a prepossessing manner. Miyazaki took a simple concept that is magic and witches flying through the air, and turned it into a film that emotionally resonates with most of those who have seen it. The plot follows Kiki, a young witch who wants to find her place in the world, and this is where the narrative truly stands out from the rest of both the other Ghibli movies, and the other witch fairytales. Kiki’s Delivery Service may seem like a witch story on the surface, but as you delve deeper into it, it begins to show itself as a movie exploring the hardships of life and a masterfully crafted coming of age story as well. The titular character is one of the most relatable to ever come out of the Ghibli discography, and is the most explored heroine in Ghibli’s catalog as well. <br />
<br />
The central character Kiki, is relatable due to the fact that her relationship with her companions is explored thoroughly, from her relationship with her black cat Gigi, to her relationship with the young boy Tombo, to her relationship with the bakery owner, and so on and so forth. Not only are the character interactions believable and thoroughly explored, but so is the fact that Kiki exhibits human behavior unlike any other Ghibli character. When I say “human” I do not mean in the sense that it is forced like some of the other Ghibli characters, as her depression and lack of self-worth arise slowly after losing something that is deep to her, which makes her character all the more believable. It doesn’t come across as something that is shallow for the sake of gaining some sympathy and tears from the audience, since the thing she lost is something which she had owned her whole life, not something cheap which came out of nowhere and then vanished that easily to garner sympathy and tears from the viewers. This is one of the very few times where Miyazaki would go into such hard topics when it came to his characters. Usually, Miyazaki’s characters are mostly joyful and cheerful, whereas Takahata’s characters are the ones to exhibit such genuine lack of emotions and self-worth, which is another factor as to why this movie stands out as something that is both unique and exceptional in Miyazaki’s discography. <br />
<br />
As for the other characters, they aren’t as well explored as Kiki, but they serve their purpose well within the narrative regardless. Kiki’s black cat, Gigi, isn’t the typical black cat that a witch would carry around, he talks, and his attempts at humor land solidly. When something devastating happens to him, the audience relates with him and to his struggles. To be able to make the audience feel attached to a character that isn’t as deeply explored as a well-developed protagonist like Kiki, is a feat that should not be underestimated, but Miyazaki did it brilliantly this time around. As for the bakery owner, she serves to guide Kiki through her emotional struggles and as a maternal figure to Kiki as well, since Kiki is a character that was forced to depart from her parents as a part of undergoing a witch training program. The contrast between the owner’s kindness and Kiki’s depression makes the emotional catharsis all the more immense here, and makes Kiki even more relatable as a character. Kiki is also not a perfect character at the end of the day, which makes her all the more relatable to the audience, especially those who struggle with hardships. Yes, she may be a witch and she may have special powers, but she isn’t a princess nor a hero prophesied in legends like most other Ghibli heroines. Kiki is clumsy, acts haphazardly at most times, especially with her terrible ability when it comes to landing her broom, and she tries to better herself and develop throughout the movie’s run. <br />
<br />
As underrated as this gorgeous movie’s characters and direction are, the most underrated aspects of it are the animation and the visuals. People do not give enough credit to this movie’s audiovisuals, as it boggles the mind how a movie that is thirty years old, can have such animation that has not aged in the least bit. It is also nice to see Ghibli upping their game with this one, as the animation progressed from stills and flappy animation back in 1986 with Castle in the Sky, to some of the most fluid animation found in Kiki’s Delivery Service. Whether it’s the beautiful hand drawn animations, or the picturesque landscapes, Ghibli never ceases to amaze with this one. The backgrounds serve the story better and make the atmosphere all the more engaging, especially with the places they chose. The colors are vibrant and give the movie more life, and become pale and lifeless when the movie needs to be serious and grim. As for the character designs, Kiki is by far the most visually striking Ghibli protagonist, her most appealing feature being her tie that she wears on her head. Her dress is only one cloth, but it’s a nice change from the ridiculous clothes many other Ghibli characters wear, and it adds more to her humble character.<br />
<br />
As for the soundtrack, this is Joe Hisaishi’s best work. The soundtrack immensely captures the beauty of the film and the general atmosphere that it was striving to achieve. The best piece Ghibli has ever put out is “A Town with an Ocean View”, as it is immensely visceral and awe inspiring, and it beats out Spirited Away’s main theme, “The Name of Life”. The other pieces helped solidify the scenes that they were placed in as well. All around this soundtrack is Hisaishi’s most emotionally striking soundtrack, even when some may argue that it isn’t his absolute best. <br />
<br />
This is Miyazaki’s masterpiece. After seeing most of what Ghibli had to offer - from the bad, to the nauseatingly slow average, to the very good, I can assure readers that this is Miyazaki’s crème de la crème. This movie contends heavily with some others that Takahata has put out, and uncertainty always arises when trying to make sure what Ghibli’s absolute magnum opus is. Regardless of that, this is Miyazaki’s visceral masterpiece, without a shadow of a doubt.

    The first time I heard of this movie was when one of my friends mentioned it as one of the movies on his &quot;to watch&quot; list.  I remember looking over the synopses and cover of the movie and wondering what the heck had gotten into him.  It&#039;s a cartoon, for heaven&#039;s sake, how good could it be?<br />
Just a few weeks ago I came down with a cold.  It was no ordinary spring cold, but the great granddaddy of all spring colds.  I was stuck in bed for around 3 days, during which time I re-acquainted myself with my inner child. 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25105">
        In other words, I watched Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service.  Then something happened.  While I had begun the movie with very low expectations, and a &quot;childish&quot; mentality, I found myself wholly captured by the movie. <br />
<br />
     Story:  The plot is simple.  Super simple.  So simple, in fact, that an overtired anime newbie with a head cold can understand it.  It begins when Kiki, a 13 year old witch makes the traditional journey away from home to begin her training in a new city for one year.  Within the city, Kiki finds an occupation, along with many new friends who help her find place in the world.  It is a cheerful and optimistic plot which is both uncommon and appreciated.<br />
<br />
     Animation: Like the storyline, the animation is simple.  Since it was made in 1989, I wasn&#039;t expecting anything fantastic, but I was pleased to find that both the simplicity and the colors matched the tone of the story and the characters. <br />
<br />
     Sound:  I think this is what really hooked me.  The music isn&#039;t absolutely fantastic, but it fits right into the scenes where you&#039;d want it to be.  It is comfortable, and fun.  The voices were also impressed me (I watched the English dub).  Perhaps that is because I started the movie with such low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the voices matched up with their characters quite nicely.<br />
<br />
     Characters:  Ah, here is where the fun part begins.  Kiki is truly the heroine in the story, and while she isn&#039;t saccharin sweet, she has a definitive moral standard.  She has the added complexity of being a tween, and having to deal with new feelings of insecurity and affection.  Her cautious and decidedly unadventurous cat, Jiji, is perhaps my favorite character, and his snide remarks had me laughing out loud every time.  The rest of the characters are distinctive, and memorable (though maybe that is because this was my first anime movie. . .).<br />
<br />
     Overall:  I thought it was a sweet, cheerful, &quot;breath of fresh air&quot; movie that I will probably watch more than once.  It isn&#039;t on my list of top favorite movies (not that I have one...), but then again, it doesn&#039;t need to be.  It is entertaining and sweet, and just the right thing to watch when you&#039;re feeling down - or when you&#039;ve caught the great granddaddy of spring colds.

    For Kiki, a young witch-in-training, the time has come to spend a year away from home. During this time, she is to mature as a person and develop into a full witch. Accompanied by her talking black cat, Jiji, Kiki will move into a new town where she will make new friends, start her own business, and even develop her first love interest. But most importantly, Kiki will come to truly understand herself and the magic that comes from within.<br />
<br />
Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service is a very sweet story and is presented in typical Studio Ghibli fashion. Animation is detailed and beautiful, and the soundtrack is enjoyable

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17102">
        and fits well with the mood of the film. Voice actors are well chosen and professional; in the English version viewers should be pleased to find the lead role of Kiki played by Kirsten Dunst. As for storyline, there isn&#039;t much that can be said: the film sets out to provide a cute story about a witch coming of age, and it is successful. If you&#039;re in the mood for something like that, you will be satisfied.<br />
<br />
Still, when I watched this with a friend that loves stuff like this, even she was somewhat let down in the end. Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service is so sweet that it&#039;s drab. Throughout the film both of us kept asking, &#039;what&#039;s the plot?&#039; And the fact of the matter is, nothing really happens in the story. Now of course a film doesn&#039;t need to have a distinctive plot to be good, but even in other character-centered Ghibli films like &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; there is something unique that makes the movie stand out. Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service simply isn&#039;t unique, doesn&#039;t have much of a plot, and cannot be carried by its characters alone. That&#039;s not to say that I didn&#039;t enjoy the film: upon finishing I didn&#039;t feel like I&#039;d wasted my time. But at the very least, I recommend that you spend your valuable time watching the other Miyazaki films first.<br />
<br />
Overall Score: B<br />
<br />

    I genuinely cannot comprehend a bigger waste of time than watching a movie about a &#039;witch&#039; who does nothing but fly on a broom. They don&#039;t even have a wand. They don&#039;t cast any magic. They waste their monumental supernatural abilities on delivering useless trinkets in return for pitiful wages. This isn&#039;t inspiring or empowering on any remote level, and having been in an open relationship with a third-generation wicken for several years, I find its depiction of witchcraft to be wholly unconvincing. <br />
<br />
What&#039;s more, the director seemingly forgot that the cat could talk about three quarters of the way through the film. For a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311728">
        movie with such meticulous detail in the visual department, you&#039;d think an editor would&#039;ve caught such a glaring gap in the script. Oh well, it can&#039;t be helped I suppose.<br />
<br />
Good animation, everything else was appalling.

    This will be my first &#039;review&#039;. So I hope this is somewhat helpful.<br />
<br />
This may not be the most famous movie of the Studio Ghibli collection, however Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service is a brilliant film in it&#039;s own right and in my opinion is often over shadowed and under appreciated because of its more famous cousins such as Spirited Away.<br />
<br />
Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service has a very simple storyline. Based off a book of the same name.  Following the life of the young witch Kiki and her cat Jijii, we follow her adventures as she goes out into the world to make a life for herself as a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review77625">
        witch in the modern world where witches are not as commonly known as they once were, with her only real witches skill being her ability to fly on a broom. This as the title suggests brings her to create a delivery service in which she uses her flying skills to help people deliver various things.<br />
<br />
The book for the most part just followed her various adventures on her deliveries from start to finish with no real focus on any particular character other than Kiki and Jiji, however the film adaptation has taken a few of these adventures and expanded upon them, as well as developed the characters associated with these to create a slightly deeper and more enjoyable film.<br />
<br />
And well that is about it, we simply see how she struggles to find a place in a new town and make a life for herself and follow as she struggles through various situations and problems, meeting friends along the way. Very simple compared to many other Studio Ghibli titles but this is not a bad thing.<br />
<br />
I feel the appeal of this movie is its simplicity and its just overall feel. Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service is a very light hearted movie that will make you smile throughout.<br />
<br />
The art as always with Studio Ghibli is fantastic as is the music and sound and the characters are appealing and well developed. I think this movie is a good example of showing that you don&#039;t need the most complex story for something to be enjoyable.<br />
<br />
I have watched both the subtitled Japanese and English dubbed versions and both are well done. Disney for the most part have done well with the dubbing, although there is some controversy to some edits from the original to the dub, which I won&#039;t go into. However I feel they do not really effect the overall story and personally prefer the way the dub comes across in the end.<br />
<br />
So if you like a story that is light hearted and sweet with a simple but effective story I would highly recommend this movie. If you however want a movie with a more deep or complex story then perhaps try else ware.<br />

    &quot;Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service&quot; is a typically fun to watch family anime from Studio Ghibli. Though it&#039;s instilled with imagination like their other productions, it isn&#039;t nearly as outlandishness as the likes of &quot;Spirited Away&quot; and &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;. This is probably due to the unusual lack of whacky character designs like Totoro and 90% of the characters in &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, however it doesn&#039;t prevent the characters that are in &quot;Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service&quot; from having that &quot;Ghibli charm&quot;. It&#039;s just as well, as &quot;Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service&quot; more about the characters than some complicated plot. The idea itself is simple enough - a young witch named Kiki has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29734">
        reached the age where she must venture out into the big wide world to fend for herself - but it&#039;s the execution that makes it count, and &quot;Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service&quot; certainly succeeds in being heart-warming and delightfully charming.  <br />
<br />
The artwork in &quot;Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service&quot; looks dated but is still of passable quality that&#039;s easy on the eye. The real strength on the technical side though, comes from the fantastic music found in the movie. The director Miyazaki has a tendency to pick great music to go with his movies, and musically this has got to be one of his finest, kicking off with a bouncy and infectiously catchy theme that caught my attention right away and put me in a great mood to watch the anime in. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s not much to complain about. One thing the comes to mind is that &quot;Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service&quot; ends rather abruptly, though the epilogue after the ending credits does repair this to some extent.<br />
<br />
As with most of Miyazaki&#039;s films, &quot;Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service&quot; is not really my type of thing, but I did enjoy it nevertheless. It has to be said though, that this isn&#039;t one of his more memorable movies, as I saw this years ago and can&#039;t really remember much about it at all. It&#039;s missing that spark provided by, say, the adorable cuteness of &quot;My Neighbour Totoro&quot; or the emotional poignancy of &quot;Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds&quot;.<br />

    I love Studio Ghibli. They make films that generally range from good to excellent and excel at art and music. Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service is probably the type of film they&#039;re best at. It has a simple story with some nice themes and a small cast of important characters who get some development but it keeps the focus on one or two of them. As a result they&#039;re able to really develop those few focus characters very well. It isn&#039;t my favourite Studio Ghibli film but it&#039;s still pretty impressive. <br />
<br />
The story follows a young witch named Kiki who leaves home to train and find her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39049">
        talent as a rite of passage. She ends up in a large city by the ocean where she encounters some trouble but gets through it with the help of many kind people. Since her special talent is flying she decides to start a delivery service. It&#039;s a pretty standard coming of age story about a young girl who leaves home to find her place in the world. The only real twist is that the girl in this case is a witch. Having a simple story isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing and Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service is done very well. The story has a very good progression and the themes are explored pretty thoroughly. It has an open ending, but that works to its advantage since the story is more relatable as a result. It honestly might be the best coming of age movie I&#039;ve ever seen. If I had to come up with a complaint about the story it would be that a lot of really convenient events happen and it starts to stretch verisimilitude really thin. But, honestly, that works perfectly with the movie&#039;s optimistic atmosphere. <br />
<br />
The characters are where it really excels. They&#039;re vibrant and interesting but they&#039;re also flawed. A few of the characters don&#039;t really experience development, but they&#039;re still written as three dimensional characters. Even the old dog who shows up in about five minutes worth of scenes is an interesting character and that really takes talent. <br />
<br />
The art is amazing. The backgrounds, characters and overall atmosphere are all done in Studio Ghibli&#039;s distinctive style It immerses you in the world which serves to make the film very engaging. The nature scenes help set the mood and, unlike some Studio Ghibli films, they don&#039;t drag on so long that they take away from the plot. I&#039;m looking at you, Only Yesterday. <br />
<br />
The voice acting is great. I especially enjoyed Takayama Minami&#039;s performance. She voices both Kiki and Ursula, and she does it so well that I only noticed because of the credits. The music is also very good and atmospheric. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m going to give Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service a yuri factor of 3. Ursula and Kiki share some really homoerotic moments, Ursula viewing Kiki as her muse is especially homoerotic, but it never really goes anywhere beyond that. Which is probably a good thing since Studio Ghibli doesn&#039;t tend to write romance very well. <br />
<br />
 My final rating for Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service is a 9/10. If you&#039;re looking for a fun, simple movie it&#039;s excellent and you&#039;ll probably enjoy watching it thoroughly. The combination of excellent visuals, interesting characters and great story all contribute to this.

    Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service is without a doubt a masterpiece.You don&#039;t need me to explain why. Just uttering the name &quot;Hayao Miyazaki&quot; should be enough to convince you to check this fantastic movie out. But in case you&#039;re some kind of freak who has no idea who I&#039;m talking about, (just kidding :P) Hayao Miyazaki is basically the Walt Disney of anime, with almost all of his releases being critically acclaimed. If you&#039;re still not convinced, I guess I better explain what makes this movie so wonderful.<br />
<br />
First of all there&#039;s the story. Kiki is a witch in training who leaves her home for a year to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review75277">
        study magic. She moves into a town known as Koriko and eventually decides to set up her own delivery service, since delivering packages on a flying broomstick is pretty convenient.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s only the plot in a nutshell, mind you. The story in this movie is a LOT deeper than you&#039;d expect in a movie with such a light-hearted concept. Although now that I think about it, I guess I&#039;m only calling it that because of how different it is from your typical movie plot. Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service has no main villain who&#039;s trying to stop Kiki.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s not to say there&#039;s no conflict however. I&#039;m sure you remember the main conflicts a work can have from English class. In this movie, the main antagonist is Kiki herself. Over the course of the movie, you learn pretty much everything there is to know about Kiki. Her goals, her fears, her insecurities.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think I&#039;m doing a very good job explaining it to be honest. All else I&#039;m going to say is that the story in this movie is very heartwarming and sweet.<br />
<br />
Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service nails the characters as well. Kiki is a very sweet girl. She&#039;s helpful and friendly, and definitely the kind of person who would bring a smile to your face. She also has her fair share of doubts about herself and her abilities as a witch. <br />
<br />
Kiki&#039;s not the only character though. There&#039;s also Jiji, her talking pet cat, who basically serves as the comedic relief in the movie. His dry, sarcastic humor and grumpy persona contrasts Kiki quite well. Then there&#039;s Tombo, a boy fascinated by flght and by extension Kiki. Even though Kiki initially takes his advances as attempts to bully her, she eventually warms up to him.<br />
<br />
Those are the three most noteworthy characters in the movie, but there&#039;s still a bunch more characters. They don&#039;t really have important roles but they are certainly good characters. You get an insight on pretty much every character that has a speaking role in this movie, even ones that are only in it for a few minutes or so.<br />
<br />
What I especially love is how realistic everyone in this movie is. Nobody has any over exaggerated personality traits. Kiki doesn&#039;t run around acting all moe squealing things like &quot;UGUUU~ ♥,&quot; Tombo isn&#039;t some disgusting pervert, and their first meeting didn&#039;t involve looking up her panties. I can easily imagine running into any of these characters in real life.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s the art and HOLY CRAP! From the moment I laid eyes on Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service, I was blown away by the amount of detail that was put into it. The animation is simply amazing. Koriko is a beautiful city that&#039;s full of life. Every single person you see in this city is unique, and they&#039;re not animated any less than Kiki is. People bump into each other and say &quot;Excuse me,&quot; The streets are full of cars, and there&#039;s always someone moving around in the background. You&#039;d really have to watch this movie to get what I&#039;m saying. In this movie, the little things really bring it to life.<br />
<br />
The sound is another thing that Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service aces. The soundtrack is beautiful. The song that sticks out in my mind the most is &quot;Umi no Mieru Machi&quot; which plays when Kiki first flies into the town of Koriko. This song fits perfectly with the shots of the villager&#039;s daily lives.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s also the main theme songs. I think it would be best to point out that this is where Disney started to pull a little 4Kids-ing. In the original English dub, the songs &quot;Rouge no Dengon&quot; and &quot;Yasashisa ni Tsutsumareta nara&quot; are replaced by &quot;Soaring&quot; and &quot;I&#039;m Gonna Fly&quot; by Sydney Forest respectively. Don&#039;t worry though, all of the changes in the English dub were approved by Miyazaki, and the DVD rerelease uses the original Japanese songs. Personally, I like the English songs better though. I feel like they relate to the theme of the movie a bit better.<br />
<br />
The voice work is excellent. The English dub features the voice work of Kirsten Dunst and the late Phil Hartman and they do a great job. I haven&#039;t really listen to the Japanese audio much, but I&#039;m going to be a crazy person and say I prefer the dub because of how they made Jiji a little snarkier.<br />
<br />
Overall, Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service is quite possibly one of the best anime movies of all time. It nails pretty much every aspect that makes a movie good perfectly. I don&#039;t know what kind of cynical jerk could possibly dislike this movie. If you haven&#039;t seen it, go watch it. RIGHT NOW!

    Ive seen other movies from ghibli studios and i really have no reason as to why this one never caught my eye, but in the end it was not at all dull as i was expecting it to be and managed to keep itself afloat in my amusement.<br />
<br />
(just want the readers to know as well that this was not at all a bad score and one of the key reasons which was always kept in mind while this review was written was the fact this was perhaps one of the directors&#039; [Hayao Miyazaki] earlier movies in which the styles of how these shows were made

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23327">
        will never be as complicated, and in-depth as the ones today. this has to be taken in consideration as well.)<br />
<br />
the story itself was simple and gave off an aura of subtlety and a slight hint of adventure in it. I cant really say anything much about the artwork other than it is simple and not glamorous and which is something i like every now and then to feel nostalgia. :)<br />
<br />
to wrap this up i will just say. this movie was not at all bad in any way, shape or, form what-so-ever, but for it to achieve the point of enjoyable, it didn&#039;t quite make it, so in the end it stays even with a five with feelings of tolerable, okay feeling. :)

           Majo no Takkyuubin, aka Kiki&#039;s Delivery service, is one of the first films by Hayao Miyazaki and studio Ghibli. When the 13 years old witch, Kiki, chose to strictly adhere to the rule that a witch must spend one year away from her family, she packs her things; rides her broom stick with her familiar, a black cat; and searches for a new city.<br />
<br />
	The city she chooses, is a beautiful, maritime one, with an Italian stylization. During her stay, she must utilize her arcane talents in order to provide for herself. While her initial reception is cold, Kiki

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224069">
        is infatuated with the city and decides to stay.<br />
<br />
	We, the audience, quickly become infatuated with the city as well; the backgrounds look spectacular and the direction manages to depict accurately the vibrant Mediterranean setting. I know it is a matter of taste, but I love the design of the early Miyazaki films and still consider them the pinnacle of the medium.<br />
<br />
	And that is the point where the praise stops. For a film that&#039;s about a magic wielder it is not magical at all, like for example its predecessor, Tonari no Totoro (1988), was. The film&#039;s main theme are the troubles of a girl stepping on the threshold from childhood to adolescence. For instance no focus is given to how kiki studies or trains for her craft, but at two scenes we see her disappointment with her plain black robes.<br />
<br />
	As the film progresses it is apparent that this is a kid&#039;s movie; the scenario is simplistic and the world&#039;s rules unestablished. The film doesn&#039;t hide that fact, and it is maybe unfair to criticize it strictly, maybe I am just spoiled by the quality Ghibli and Pixar films, but it just is not as good as the competition.<br />
<br />
	While it fails to transcend its genre like Mimi wo Sumaseba (1995), or the Incredibles (2004), it is still a very cute family film, that will resonate especially well with young girls. Know your expectations and enjoy the spirited animation. 6.0/10.

    I&#039;m currently watching every Ghibli movie in chronological order, and I have to say, Kiki might be the best one I&#039;ve seen yet. Grave of the Fireflies was a very good one, but I can&#039;t say it is enjoyable, I spent most of it suffering and the ending was devastating. Totoro was a huge disappointment, it&#039;s not bad by any means, but it&#039;s the flagship of the studio, and I expected a lot more of the movie.<br />
<br />
Kiki, to me, is why Ghibli is so charming and entertaining. First of all, needless to say, the art is 10/10 (it&#039;s Ghibli after all). But what really captivated

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369025">
        me is the character arc the protagonist, Kiki, goes through. I struggled with depression, feeling useless and trying desperately to fit in somewhere, and being unable because of my own self-destructing thoughts. Although lightly, this movie touches on that aspect of depression, which really resonated with me on an emotional level to the point I cried when seeing a specific scene (a scene with a chocolate cake, you know the one if you&#039;ve watched this), because I felt like that was exactly what she needed to finally break out of her state.<br />
<br />
If I had to say something bad, it would be that as usual in Ghibli movies, every character besides the main one(s) is really shallow, and that (also usual in Ghibli movies) the ending feels really abrupt. A few arcs don&#039;t get finished and, like with Nausicaa, Laputa and Totoro, I felt the movie could be 10 to 15 minutes longer and it would improve a lot.

    Quick Thoughts:<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a nice coming-of-age movie. We get to see themes like independence, jealousy, and self-awareness told through a young girl leaving home to develop herself as a witch. The movie is visually appealing as expected from Ghibli films. I think my biggest issue with the film is that it doesn&#039;t really stand out in comparison to similar anime. Even just among the Ghilbli catalogue, I think there a movies that explore the same themes in much more interesting settings.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The story is pretty easy to follow. Our main character, Kiki, leaves home to gain experience as a witch in the city. She stumbles along in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353576">
        the city, struggling to find a place to stay until she&#039;s meets a nice couple who lets her establish a delivery service in a bakery. That&#039;s roughly the first fourth of the movie and there&#039;s not much of a central plot after that. There&#039;s one more delivery which serves mostly for comic relief, a generic romance sub-plot, and some normal teenage angst. Kiki&#039;s witch abilities are the only thing that stand out in an otherwise bland setting, and even then all she really does is fly on a broom and talk to her cat. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The animation is smooth as expected. The art style is fine, but character design is pretty generic. Kiki looks the same as just about any Ghibli protagonist except she&#039;s in a black dress; the background/side characters are very samey as well. <br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
<br />
The soundtrack is pretty reserved and laid-back, which fit in with the seaside city setting. Not sure if it was an issue with the video source, but there notable lack of sound/music in the last scene which led to some awkward silence in what looked like a tense situation.  The voice-acting was fine, didn&#039;t think were any standout performances.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
Kiki as a character is fine for the themes this movie covers, but she doesn&#039;t do much to stand out outside of that. Like I mentioned before, her witch abilities are supposed to be what makes her unique but that aspect is hardly explored in the movie. She&#039;s very much just a generic teenage girl for most of the film. None of the side characters were that notable, they generally had too little screentime to matter, or just filled role as a plot device for Kiki.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
The first 20 minutes or so were kind of enjoyable. I thought it would be cool to see witch adjust to city life and find a role, but the movie hits lull shortly after that it never really gets out of. I struggled to find much enjoyable about the rest of the movie.

    This is probably one of my favourite studio ghibli films that I have seen.<br />
It&#039;s sweet, magical and has some kind of charm to it.<br />
The story is lovely as its a girl training to be a witch however she decides to do deliveries as she can fly around on her broom stick which is kinda cool!!<br />
I think I enjoyed it because its always nice to watch an original anime film that has a strange story line to it.<br />
The art is amazing!<br />
Some of the characters remind me of &#039;sabrina the teenage witch&#039; e.g. black talking cat but still really cool characters.<br />
Overall I would say this film is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review24782">
        worth watching as it&#039;s wonderful and it really gets you in the mood ;)<br />

    This will have spoilers. <br />

Majo no Takkyuubin, Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service, is a coming-of-age story for a little witch girl, who ultimately wants to find her place in a growing hustle-and-bustle city that is largely unamicable and unfamiliar with witches. This makes it difficult for Kiki to find her place in society, but this film teaches that through hard work, kindness, perseverance, and a little help from the right people, you can find where you belong.<br />
<br />
This story highlights the importance of valuing the slower, more earnest things in life; whether that&#039;s a friend who loves art, the elderly, airships, friends, or a welcoming bakery shop owner.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417065">
        In the grand scheme of things, taking the time to do the great things you love, (and making it a part of your everyday life) is worth more than anything. <br />
<br />
As with most any Ghibli movie, the art and style used are very aesthetically pleasing, fitting, and beautiful. It truly is a work of art. The film demonstrates a very pleasing scenery of nature, in the woods and suburbs, but also highlights the hustle and bustle of the city through the advancing technology of cars, airships, cops, and even the fact that the newer generations in the city seem pretty unfamiliar and even aghast when it comes to witches like Kiki.  <br />
<br />
Overall it is a very heartwarming and wholesome watch when seeing this little girl try her hardest to do things seemingly out of her reach, only to be pushed in the right direction by the best of people. She learns to make friends, grows confident in her abilities and appearance, and despite a couple of big mishaps, she finds herself at home.

    You won&#039;t find here big castles or dragons, neither forest spirits nor ancient gods, &quot;Majo no Takkyuubin&quot; shows us the difficulties of growing and becoming independent through a sweet young witch who experiences emotions such as insecurity, loneliness, fear and loss of hope; representing  immigrants, young adults moving out and the innocence of children forced to grow up too fast.<br />
The simplicity and tenderness, together with characters full of human values, the spectacular animation and an incredible soundtrack made by the master Joe Hisaishi, make this film a feat.<br />
I promise you will found yourself wholly captured by the movie, it will melt your heart.

    &quot;Stop trying. Take long walks. Look at scenery. Doze off at noon. Don&#039;t even think about flying. And then, pretty soon, you&#039;ll be flying again!&quot;<br />
<br />
(WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS)<br />
<br />
Kiki is a witch that has just became Thirteen the day of her birthday: This is the age when witches become independent, and also the time to transfer to another city and find a job.<br />
<br />
So the very same day, she flies with her broom along with her faithful talking cat, Jiji, saying goodbye to her birthplace and her parents and friends: A new adventure is about to begin!<br />
<br />
Even though it isn&#039;t said, it can be guessed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404903">
        that Kiki is very insecure: In fact, she thinks she isn&#039;t a witch to all effects because she can&#039;t do magic like other witches.<br />
<br />
However she is really good at flying: In fact after thinking a lot about what to do resting in the dormitory of a kind baker couple who offered her a place to sleep (This is an anime, please remember to never trust strangers guys, please be aware of what happened to Colleen Stan) she decides to be a &quot;Flying Delivery Girl&quot;.<br />
<br />
During her first work, she will unfortunately bear with a great storm that will make her delivery pack fall in a wood. However she encounters an easy-going and kind painter girl that will help her adjust the cat-peluche (The thing she had to deliver for a birthday) and the two of them will become friends. After helping her cleaning her house, she will finally save her poor cat Jiji, who had to pretend to be a peluche in order to don&#039;t make her lose the job.<br />
<br />
Kiki seems to finally have found her vocation and her place in the world: She loves herself more finally understanding how hard-working, responsible and how kind she is (She will  give up to go to a friend&#039;s party in order to help one of her clients in need even if it wasn&#039;t a part of her job), Being in love with her work, happy to make other people happy by delivering them gifts.<br />
<br />
However one day, something unexpected happened: She loose her flying powers, and as well her powers to understand the cat&#039;s language.<br />
She is really sad, because no matter how hard she tried she couldn&#039;t fly anymore, so she had to pause from working (Something really rare in Japan that our master Hayao Miyazaki wanted to point out: In Japan people work way too hard, and that&#039;s why sometimes they loose inspiration and their will to work, and as well sometimes even die because of too much stress , either by suicide or cardiac arrest. Hayao Miyazaki wanted to tell us that is ok to not feel inspired all the time and that is also ok to pause from working for all the time we need, because it can actually be benefical for us and for improving our services to other people.)<br />
<br />
During her rest time, she decides to stay at the Painter&#039;s place, learning to have fun just like people of her age do, and finally learning how to be more patient with herself without cancelling her first achievements, believing in her capacities and accepting her tiredness.<br />
<br />
She will in fact be inspired by the Painter&#039;s speech where she said she also lost her will and capacity of painting at some point of her life, but that her passion returned all alone after some time.<br />
<br />
Some days after, she will indeed obtain her powers back, and her life will eventually returns to normality, having fun with her life and her loved ones.<br />
<br />
I honestly feel like this movie is an enormous and rassicurant hug, telling you that everything will be ok and to love yourself more and to accept your faults as part of your persona.<br />
<br />
I also had a period when I didn&#039;t feel inspired by anything, because I was indeed in a bad period and I needed to rest, and this movie helped me a lot to not loose my respect for myself and to go on with my life, because I knew that everything would eventually re-acquire colors, because no situation lasts forever. It will surely happen again, but I will ready to face it thanks to what Kiki taught me.<br />
<br />
If you ever feel depressed, uninspired or insecure, please watch this movie, it will surely help you out and relax you.<br />
Remember to believe in yourself always, even when you do mistakes or don&#039;t give your all in something you love, because it is just a period that will be past one day. You have your worth, don&#039;t forget that ^-^<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading my review, Have a great time on mal !&lt;3

    overall score: 2<br />
<br />
I would first like to point out I watched the Dub and i don&#039;t know if maybe the sub adds something to this film I didn&#039;t get out of the dub version<br />
<br />
Minor spoilers<br />
Story: 1<br />
<br />
So I did not enjoy this movie at all I was expecting kiki to go through all sorts of hardships, learn to survive in a new city, grow as a witch and find her place in the world. Instead, I watched a weirdly glorified delivery service girl who is horrible to people for no reason, get jealous, have everything handed to her, face some minor issues that are easily solved.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329011">
        There is only one lesson she really learns and it&#039;s so forced into the narrative it just feels annoying. Loads of plot setups never go anywhere and I didn&#039;t actually see any growth in kiki at all from the beginning to the end of the movie. I&#039;m not entirely sure what the point of this movie was?? ALSO, WHY WAS THE CAT THING NEVER ADDRESSED??? <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
I mean its a ghibli film, so it&#039;s pretty and this is probably one of the saving points of the film, it was nice to look at especially from something so old <br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
<br />
Some nice soundtracks, kind of hard to not compare it to other Ghibli films in this category however<br />
<br />
Character: 2<br />
<br />
this category gets a 2 and that&#039;s purely for the forest lady and the boy <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall:2<br />
<br />
