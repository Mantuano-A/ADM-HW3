    &quot;Everybody&#039;s youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness.&quot; F. Scott Fitzgerald. <br />
<br />
Oh youth and the epic journey called growing up. Most people tend to, in a way or another, be deeply defined by their teenage years. High school is a fond memory to some and a painful one to others, but I think everyone can agree that it is a unique and special period of our lives, one that has no equal. Most people quickly relate the words High School with friendship, as the friends you make in that period of time seem to leave a permanent mark in your memories and so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57121">
        does the time you spend with them, most of which is filled talking about something random or even stupid, laughing at simple and normal things, sharing mutual interests and hobbies, talking about the opposite gender in a playful or perverted way and worrying about the weirdest things. Yes, those years you spend in High School are special in a simple and silly way and it is that way that Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou (DKN) tries and successfully manages to recreate in a hilarious manner.<br />
<br />
[Story] - 8 - Daily Lives of High School Boys. That&#039;s basically it. It is a standard slice of life type of story, but one that works amazingly well. The episodes are divided into segments and focus on a big number of characters, each of them with his own peculiarities, as he endures daily tasks. To portray something so simple in an amusing way is not easy at all and I think most animes that actually try this end up filled up with dull boring moments that just kill the mood. DKN avoids that in almost every single scene which is quite amazing and even in its worse episode you&#039;ll still laugh out loud quite some times. Most segments are short which gives the comedic tone light, random and fast paced giving it a tremendous enjoyability. To sum things up, it isn&#039;t an amazing and complex storyline since it is a slice of life, but the setting and the execution of the comedy match and fit each other so well that you just can&#039;t care about how simple the story is.<br />
<br />
[Art] - 8 - Not much to point out here. The art was acceptably good. It didn&#039;t need to be better anyway. The character design was adequate with  a pretty good worn on some characters&#039; expressions. <br />
The animation was good enough for it. It didn&#039;t particularly shine, but I never felt like it needed to be better, so I guess they did a good job with it.<br />
<br />
[Sound] - 9 - Alright, so I had to give the 9 here for two specific reasons. First of all the soundtrack was very fitting and comedic. The Literature Girl Song cracked me up every single time, it was absolutely perfect for those moments and just hearing the song alone will make you laugh so that&#039;s a great job there. Then the second reason lies in the voice actors. Since I&#039;m not an experiences anime reviewer I wasn&#039;t sure about where I should talk about this, so I&#039;m just including it within the sound for obvious reasons. Yeah I have to admit I&#039;m a Gintama Fan, so having Sugita (probably my favorite voice actor) and Suzumura playing two of the main characters made the anime that much better. Sugita&#039;s voice fit Hidenori too well and his natural ability of making everything he says funny was perfect here. Other than them I also have to positively mention other very fitting voices like Motoharu&#039;s (Daisuke Namikawa), Ringo&#039;s (Aoi Yuuki) and Yanagi&#039;s (Yuu Kobayashi). Indeed a great selection of voice actors.<br />
<br />
[Characters] - 9 - Probably one of its strongest points, since most times the punchlines rely completely on the characters as the humor is very character-driven on most scenes. Something very good about this series is the fact that the main character doesn&#039;t monopolize every scene, in fact it&#039;s just the opposite - he doesn&#039;t even show up in two or three episodes at all. The secondary characters are hilarious, each of them playing right into a character stereotype but adding a sort of twist to it. Motoharu, the delinquent who&#039;s supposedly badass and mature, but still get&#039;s manipulated by older girls and is strangely deep and introspective, also having an above the average sensitivity and fragile spirit. Literature Girl, the mysterious silent girl who stands by the riverside staring into the horizon lost in thought, but she&#039;s actually just a naive wannabe novel author looking for an ideal encounter with a guy by the riverside. Among many others.<br />
<br />
[Enjoyment] - 9.5 - Maybe I&#039;m exaggerating here but I feel that the 10 is appropriate. Most episodes went by extremely fast and I laughed like a mad man at most scenes from beginning to end. If a comedy that achieves that doesn&#039;t deserve the 10 in enjoyment then few animes do. I really enjoyed this very much and agree with people that relate its sense of humor to Gintama and Nichijou - which I also liked quite a lot. It really surprised me, since I didn&#039;t watch any trailers. I just saw a new anime called Daily Lives of High School Boys and thought &quot;well I have 20 minutes free so why not? It&#039;ll probably be filled with female-targetted fanservice though...&quot;. Then the first episode blew me away. It&#039;s actually very easy to tell if you&#039;ll like this series or not - just watch the first episode. If you dislike the first episode you don&#039;t need to see more as you most likely won&#039;t like it at all.<br />
<br />
[Overall] - 9 - Overall a solid comedy anime that any comedy fan should check out. Get some friends together one afternoon and watch a couple of episodes, it&#039;ll probably feel even better!<br />
<br />
I hope you decide to give it a shot and thank you for reading!

    What is the first thing pop up in your head when you hear a high-school-slice-of life-comedy anime? Boring, if you ask me. I used to think that a pure comedy show revolving around high school students life is so common and dull, my perception changed after I watched Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, I will refer it as Nichibro from this point. The title may give you a doubt, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if you&#039;re skeptical, what&#039;s so great about watching a comedy anime revolving around highschoolers&#039; everyday life? I&#039;d say Nichibro stands out because it succeed in delivering what it offers, that is comedy.<br />
<br />
The title

          <span style="display: none;" id="review116713">
        of this anime literally describes what this show is all about; the daily lives of high school boys. No it&#039;s not about cute boys do cute things, but it&#039;s about a group of school boys do what they do best, such as slacking off in a friend&#039;s house, pranking on people, talking about girls, telling random stories and any other things in exaggeration manners. Nichibro is a gag based anime much like Nichijou-- its girls counterpart. The format is also similar; every episode of this series is composed of several random short skits which usually are not connected to each other. Each skit focuses on a slapstick humor with a punchline at the end. I personally found most of them hit the mark while others are predictable. It&#039;s like getting a present on a Christmas morning; sometimes you get what you want, sometimes you are unsure and sometimes it&#039;s an ugly sweater. In other words, some people may find one or two skits boring and unfunny, and some other may not. After all, I believe comedy is very subjective, you can&#039;t really argue what&#039;s funny or not, it&#039;s a matter of taste-- what&#039;s funny to one person will not always to another.<br />
<br />
As for the art, Nichibro is quite decent but it&#039;s not amazing either. Although the background is simple but it&#039;s pretty detailed especially the buildings which is fine for this kind of show. The characters are well drawn and they look natural, like how the male characters aren&#039;t wearing their uniform properly. That&#039;s how the high school boys dressed. They leave their ties undone, some characters even don&#039;t bother to wear ties at all, their shirt are un-tucked, even Karasawa is wearing a hat all the time. The funny expressions or the faces they make is enough to make me burst out in laughter. The characters are also well animated, I notice some characters look alive and vibrant. There is one thing I&#039;m complaining about its design, they (the studio) probably decided to cut corners by drawing some characters with no eyes or it was simply lazy, I have no idea. Still, one can say it&#039;s on purpose to show which ones are the main characters. Overall it doesn&#039;t ruin the show thou.<br />
<br />
Another strong point of this show is the characters. First of all, Nichibro doesn&#039;t have much character development. I believe character development isn&#039;t always necessary especially in a pure comedy show like this one, as long as they are there to make you laugh, that will do. Now let&#039;s check out our main characters, the first is Tadakuni, he is the straight man in the group and probably the most ordinary among the trio, but surprisingly, he&#039;s someone you can easy relate to. He&#039;s usually needed to pull off the jokes. Hidenori, he&#039;s the one who usually comes up with crazy schemes. The last is my favourite, Yoshitake, the blond guy. He usually plays along when Hidenori comes up with anything stupid. Their exaggerated attitudes, expressions and randomness are really amusing to watch. In the midst of the series, in fact, they don&#039;t &quot;eat&quot; all the screen time. In other words, if one is too &quot;normal&quot; being a student, he won&#039;t have much screen time. This when the supporting characters rise. I find the supporting roles are very interesting as well, complete with their own unique personalities. One thing I mind is how violence the girls are to the boys. In my opinion, it&#039;s a bit overusing for a slapstick joke anime like this.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t say much about the sound. The opening song is rather typical but I find the ending sequence is really something. They put a skit on the ending which is very interesting. The upbeat and catchy music while the casts are performing a play in cultural festival is hilarious. The randomness on it is epic. I have no complaints for the voice acting. The voice actors fits the characters, especially Hidenori who&#039;s voiced by Sugita (he also has done voice for Gintoki). The way when he talks to himself or when he&#039;s overthinking something really makes me laugh.<br />
<br />
My personal note; Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is a solid comedy show. If you&#039;re looking for good laughs, I&#039;d like to suggest you to give it a shot. In my experience, in every episode I&#039;ve watched I always find at least one or two skits that are funny and memorable. Moreover, I&#039;m sure you can somehow relate them to your highschool life, although it won&#039;t be as extreme and funny as in this series. This is the first time I&#039;ve watched an anime that is divided into several skits each episode and I like it. I would gladly recommend this to everyone. Overall, This show is thoroughly entertaining and worthy my time.

    “I suppose if we couldn&#039;t laugh at the things that don&#039;t make sense, we couldn&#039;t react to a lot of life.” – Hobbes, from Calvin and Hobbes.<br />
<br />
As a stressed out college student, I constantly find myself looking back at my high school years and remembering the fun old times. My all boys school meant that we could rein in free chaos without the worry of having to act proper around girls, so my class and I did all sorts of pranks and whatnot. From playing football in the hallway, to accidentally taking down a security camera, to taking down the school flag and wearing it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184281">
        as a cape, lighting up fireworks in class, all those things. Truth be told, high school was boring, but my classmates made it so much fun during our free time. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is about.<br />
<br />
A comedy anime like no other, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou (or Daily Life of High School Boys if you prefer) had me laughing just as much (and probably more) as any comedic work out there. I found myself wiping tears from my eyes constantly and enjoying every single second of it. At twelve episodes in length, Danshi Koukousei promises that you will enjoy every single moment.<br />
<br />
First off, Danshi Koukousei has no overarching story. There is no typical high school plot in here as you would imagine from most generic slice of life animes. In fact, the show is presented in what most people would refer to as a ‘skit’ format. An episode of the anime will generally contain in average eight skits, each of them representing wildly different aspects of the free time that high school boys face on a day to day basis and what they do to liven up their boring lives.<br />
<br />
Of course, most of these are exaggerated at some points, but there isn’t anything wrong with that. In fact, it adds more to the realism of the show and how high school boys tend to exaggerate normal situations in their mind. Add that to the fact this anime is a HUGE parody of anime as a whole, taking in various anime tropes and destroying them before your very eyes. Oh you were expecting this to happen? Well haha, FUCK YOU PREDICTABILITY!<br />
<br />
On the subject of characters, there is no better way to describe the main cast as extremely human. Each character has his own little quirk that makes him instantly relatable to someone. I found myself constantly laughing and thinking along the lines of: “Oh my God that is so my friend from senior year!” <br />
<br />
The main cast is comprised of the trio of destiny: Tadakuni (whose last name is never revealed and in fact parodied by the show itself), Hidenori, and Yoshitake. Tadakuni is your straight man, the guy who is dragged into the crazy and manic antics that his two best friends get themselves in to. Hidenori is the bespectacled one, the playboy of the group and generally the inner monologue heavy guy who analyzes situations over and over again in a very comedic fashion. And finally, we have Yoshitake, the blonde dyed member of the group who is usually the idiot and goes along with whatever the situation around him dictates. <br />
<br />
Aside from those three, the anime introduces many many characters throughout the course of its run, giving us a well varied and excellently written cast. However, due to the sheer amount of characters, it’s kind of hard to remember the names of all of them. But, this is beautifully averted when the anime itself tells you that, while it knows its introducing many characters late into the show, it’s not important to remember all their names. <br />
<br />
It is also important to acknowledge the main female characters from this extensive male cast. At the end of every episode, there is an extra skit titled “High School Girls Are Funky!” which features three girls (Yanagi, Habara and Ikushima) who are basically the female counterparts of the main trio. While their skits are not as funny as the male ones, they are still the parts of the series where backstory is heavy handed and offers some insight into the past of some of the characters which, at least in my book, is a step in the right direction.<br />
<br />
On the topic of animation, the studio responsible for animating this is Sunrise Inc., famous for shows such as The Visions of Escaflowne, Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass, Tiger and Bunny, among others. In itself, the animation is very simplistic and it actually works in favor of the show’s theme. Add that to the fact that most of the characters sport some weirdly exaggerated faces to go along with some of the jokes makes said jokes all the better. A curious thing to note about the animation is the decision to shadow the eyes of the majority of the small female cast. This, I found out much later, was surprisingly parodied by the show as well in one of the later skits. <br />
<br />
The voice cast does a beautiful job with the characters as well. Most of the voices are blown out of proportion for some of the jokes, which makes the delivery of them all the better. You might find some of the voices rather familiar, particularly with Hidenori’s seiyuu Tomokazu Sugita, famous for lending his voice to Gintama, another comedy anime. Miyu Irino is present here as the voice of Tadakuni, showcasing his amazing talent, and Kenichi Suzumaru is here as well, giving his voice to the bumbling idiot that is Yoshitake. Add to those three Daisuke Namikawa as the voice of everyone’s favorite delinquent Motoharu, and you have one of the best voiced casts in recent anime history (at least that’s how I see it).<br />
<br />
Aside from that, the music is also very well executed. Audio Highs, known for their previous work in Bakuman and Gintama, are responsible for the masterfully well-crafted music that is present in this show. The anime sports one opening and one ending, with the opening being “Shiny tale” by Mix Speakers, Inc. while the ending theme is “O-hi-sama” by Amesaki Annainin. Both are very good, with the first one really pumping you up for a high school anime while the ending is… well, stupid. It simply fits with the whole theme of the show in its own, unique, way.<br />
<br />
Now that I’ve covered everything there is, it’s time to go down to the final verdict.<br />
<br />
This show means a lot to me. Not just because it made me laugh, but because some of the skits that the show has are actually situations that occurred to me during my daily life while in high school. The days I spent laughing with my friends, worrying about a friend’s little sister (well, actually it was his cousin) and whatnot really brought me memories that had long passed. It made me look back in life and smile at how beautiful everything was with my old friends and how much I miss them. It’s an anime I hold very near and dear to my heart simply because of the feelings it evoked in me while watching it and, truth be told, for being the funniest anime I have seen in my entire life.<br />
<br />
Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou gets a very well deserved 9/10. It would be a 10, but the short length left me wanting for more. But, just like everything else, even the short length is parodied by the show. Aside from that, a couple of jokes fell flat on their faces, but this didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment of the show.<br />
<br />
Much thanks to Mel, for proofreading this (I love you my little internet daughter), Erika, for providing her helpful insight, and my good friend Wendy, who should write some reviews of her own because she is a FREAKING GENIUS.<br />
<br />
There will be more to come, so expect more from me in the following months. AND AS ALWAYS, ANY FEEDBACK WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED.<br />
<br />
This is Team Dai-Squirtle, to the stars and back!	<br />

    I knew I had to check this one out after watching the trailer. It&#039;s as everyone says, Kimi to Boku with Nichijou&#039;s humor and style. Gags are real...hilarious. Incidentally, Tadakuni is Kimi to Boku&#039;s Chizuru (seiyuu), Yoshitake is Gintama&#039;s Sougo, and Hidenori, Gintama&#039;s Gintoki (that mad funny gag anime, too)!!! I recognized those voices right off the trailer. The vocal talents just fit in well the characters. I&#039;m looking forward to this show, more made of laughter moments to come. Another Sambaka (Those Three (Idiot) Guys) is born!

    Warning: There will be a copious amount of taking my comedy anime seriously<br />
<br />
Daily Lives of Highschool Boys is a satire of anime&#039;s depiction of highschool life. The entire name and set up is a direct reference to the glut of anime about a bunch of girls doing cute shit in highschool, although it frequently jumps into referencing romance anime or other dude wish fulfilment stuff. From the very direct referencing of K-ON to the highlighting that boys &#039;are only any use in sports or battle anime&#039;, it&#039;s constantly lampshading this genre. But what makes it better than most anime&#039;s attempts at parody is it&#039;s not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57417">
        a &#039;playful parody&#039;. It&#039;s not doing the exact same thing these other anime are doing except pointing to itself occasionally and shouting &#039;look at me, I&#039;m doing this thing that other anime does, aren&#039;t I cool&#039;. It mocks these aspects and satirises them, and through its depiction highlights what makes them ridiculous or dumb.<br />
<br />
Take the show&#039;s seemingly most popular segment, Literature Girl. The characters start to spout lines about the weather is, except in poetic ways to indicate their feelings at the time. But instead of leaving it at that, which is what many self-serious romance anime do, it provides a running commentary track with the male character constantly berating his own attempts to sound cool, and in turn laughing at the girl&#039;s own attempts to fulfil this ideal romantic scene she&#039;s seen in romance stories. It&#039;s also satirised it from the girl&#039;s side too, a character whose own attempts to put herself into these idealistic romantic situations turn her into this raving mad girl whose desperation to fulfil these checklists from her fanfiction only serve to drag her further down in the eyes of the male love interest of her choice.<br />
<br />
Another area of choice Nichibros mocks other anime is the depiction of girls. Instead of cutesy ideal girlfriends, the women in this series are how highschool boys in real life feel girls are like. They&#039;re scary monstrous beings, completely incomprehensible, whose only aim is to jam more suffering onto the lives of the boys. The depiction is no less realistic than the hyper cutesy versions of other anime (although many of the women I follow on twitter seemed to find this less-celebratory depiction more realistic), the fact that they go all out with this depiction of girls as universally horrible is a large part of the reason I respect its devotion to satire. This all comes to a head in the Highschool Girls Are Funky segments, which takes a group of girls starting scenarios the exact same way the girls in something like K-ON does, but go in completely different directions due to how horrible they all are. The first segment in particular stands out, for one girl asks what they are going to do today, followed by another girl yelling at her and punching her in the face. Completely fucking ridiculous, but its direct contrast and reference to K-ON and its ilk frames the scene and uses this contrast to highlight how ridiculous the insufferably nice versions of highschool girls are.<br />
<br />
And so on and so forth, the show satirises so many various aspects of how unrealistic the depictions of highschool life is. Sometimes it&#039;s just through placing this scenes in more realistic settings, such as the above literature girl segment, or how the boys try to act out scenes from their favourite RPGs but completely lose the sense of the plot. There&#039;s satirising through exaggeration, such as the depiction of girls or the very opening segment where the main character leaves house with a piece of toast in his mouth, followed by his friends eating bowls of ramen. There&#039;s a few ones that defy classification, such as the depiction of sisters. They&#039;re not desirable love toys. Rather, they&#039;re inhuman creatures that you&#039;ve spent so much time around that you don&#039;t even consider them as girls anymore. They&#039;re referred to solely as &quot;X&#039;s imouto&quot; and are never shown to have any eyes.<br />
<br />
Again I could go on, but all I&#039;d be doing is continuing to spoil the various jokes in the anime. What I&#039;m trying to say is that Daily Lives of Highschool Boys is a satire of modern anime&#039;s depiction of highschool and how this can warp the expectations of teenagers for how this life is supposed to run. When viewed through this filter, every joke in the series takes on a new light. It&#039;s not the actual daily lives of highschool boys. It&#039;s the daily lives of highschool boys as viewed through the filter of how anime thinks their lives should go.<br />
<br />
On a personal note, I had pegged this show completely incorrectly pre-season. I probably shouldn&#039;t have, what with the director being the same guy who did School Rumble and Gintama. But a season before this we got Kimi to Boku. It was an unusual idea, having cute boys doing cute things rather than girls. But the end result was the exact bloody same. You could have swapped those genders around and got the exact same shit we have been getting for the past few years, except now seen through a more shoujo-y filter. It made me depressed. I love anime because of how it can take totally crazy ideas and animate them to make wonderful stories no other medium would even dare to try approach. Yet we were living in an era where it was becoming commonplace to make non-stories about a bunch of kids doing nothing. The announcement of Daily Lives of Highschool Boys struck fear into my heart because I thought perhaps Kimi to Boku was not just a once off, and that cute girls doing nothing was going to spread into other genres.<br />
<br />
So thank you Daily Dudes. Thank you for not only being that, but satirising the very thing I thought you were going to be.

    The opening scene of the first episode is a hilarious and wonderful introduction to this series, but unfortunately Daily Lives of High School Boys goes off the rails shortly after the OP and never returns.<br />
<br />
Daily Lives tries to play around with and subvert the tropes, cliches, and stereotypes common to slice-of-life anime (and anime in general), but doesn&#039;t always succeed in sending them up properly -- which sometimes seems more like an endorsement of the cliches than a critique thereof. I think this is the core reason why Daily Lives fails, though there are a raft of other problems that further damn this series.<br />
<br />
STORY (4)<br />
There

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149583">
        really isn&#039;t a story, just a collection of skits. The stories of the various skits are each individually well thought out and inventive. The lack of plot progression from one skit isn&#039;t necessarily a problem, but when coupled with the lack of character progression it means that nothing progresses, so there&#039;s little to engage with or look forward to in the series.<br />
<br />
The humor of the series is centered around social awkwardness. This style of humor just isn&#039;t my thing, and so I didn&#039;t find very funny most of the jokes and situations in the series. This is a subjective criticism, yes, but on a more objective note, Daily Lives lacks variety in its humor and suffers as a result -- perhaps more for some viewers than others.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER (1)<br />
The characters of Daily Lives are properly fleshed out, enough at least for the show&#039;s premise. Unfortunately, they are also unlikeable dicks who lie, cheat, steal, and prey on others. They are absurdly exaggerated caricatures of actual &quot;high school boys,&quot; which could have been a source of humor and a send-up of cliches, but they are exaggerated in a negative direction.  They don&#039;t just tease their friends, they abuse them. They don&#039;t just not know how to talk to girls, they are in fact thoroughly misogynistic. They don&#039;t just get into trouble, but they actively try to frame their friends for their own misdeeds. They are not believable, likeable, or compelling. <br />
<br />
Given what terrible people they all are, friendship seems out of place in the Daily Lives universe. I could scarcely imagine any of these detestable cretins having positive emotions towards anyone, but if one considers the possibility of Stockholm syndrome, they can be seen as somewhat believable. The moments in which the viewers are granted psychological insight into the characters&#039; minds are gratifying, if only because it provides reassurance that each are indeed sane and reasonable, because their actions routinely indicate otherwise.<br />
<br />
The occasional side characters who are actually not evil, insane, malicious dirtbags are usually taken advantage of or injured by those who are, further compounding Daily Lives&#039; enormous problems with characterization and storytelling.<br />
<br />
ART (8) &amp; SOUND (8)<br />
I appreciated the light, smooth animation style, which fit both the quotidian theme of the show and the flights of fancy the characters are prone to. Sound and voice acting are good also.<br />
<br />
OVERALL (4)<br />
Daily Lives conveys just one thing: High school boys are horrendous people who should be avoided at all costs. There is no coherence among the various skits and no progression in the characters. There is nothing compelling to keep viewers watching, aside from the comedy (if that&#039;s your thing). On the other hand, there is certainly plenty repulsive to make viewers think twice about watching.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT (2)<br />
Daily Lives is a thoroughly offensive, painfully unfunny, totally disjointed, inexpert, hackneyed, awkward, depressing, detestable, insulting, poorly-conceived excuse for an anime, and  I thoroughly regret having ever watched it.

    Story (9/10) - <br />
<br />
Daily Lives of High School Boys is a 12 episode series based off a manga by Yasanobu Yamauchi. The series follows the daily lives of high school students, specifically, the comings and goings of the all male student population at Sanda North Boys High. Yup. That’s it. Don’t look for anything more earth shattering than that, guys. That’s all you get with Daily Lives; odd boys doing odd things…just like Lucky Star is cute girls doing cute things. This show doesn’t try to rewrite the book on what a high school comedy can be; it just uses a tried and true formula

          <span style="display: none;" id="review168801">
        and rolls with it, using the everyday conversations and situations high school boys face on a day-to-day basis to push things along. However, the thing that makes this show stand out more than other high school comedies, is the fact that the writing seems so unique. <br />
<br />
Art (8/10) – <br />
<br />
The animation style of Daily Lives is much like the show itself; nothing out of the ordinary. Everything is very well done, as is expected of a project tag-teamed by Square Enix and Studio Sunrise. I have to say, I really liked the character designs this time around. Unlike Free! who felt the need to give their male cast these bulging, rippling, “there’s no way in HELL those can exist on a regular human” mound of muscles, “Nichibros” give these characters an awkward gawky look that makes them more endearing to the viewer. One thing that I noticed about this particular show, animation wise, was the fact that the creators made a point not to show ANY male character wearing their uniform correctly–everyone has their shirts un-tucked, some characters leave their ties undone or don’t wear the ties at all. It adds a level of realism to the whole thing–after all, do you HONESTLY expect a group of high school boys to wear the uniform the RIGHT way? I do question why the animators decided to give some of their non-main characters the shadow eye treatment. While it doesn’t really take anything AWAY from the anime, it is a bit distracting.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10) - <br />
<br />
The opening theme this time around is “Shiny Tale” by Mix Speakers, Inc. Seriously, I can’t get enough of this song. It’s so upbeat and it actually sounds like the opening theme for an anime that’s centered on high school boys. The Entire Cast of &quot;Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou&quot; in the End Credits...Note The Haruhi Cosplayer...The animation it’s played over is awesome and matches extremely well. The closing theme is “Ohisama” [&quot;Sun&quot;] by Amessaki Annainin. This song…well…it’s weird. Not “bad” weird, don’t get me wrong at all, but it’s weird on a “what the heck am I listening to, and why do I like it so much” weird. I can honestly say this is the first time I’ve ever heard a kazoo used as a musical instrument in an anime theme song…and it’s not bad! The animation that plays over the scene is, for all intents and purposes, the funniest ending credit sequence I’ve ever seen…EVER. You can keep the karaoke scenes at the end of Lucky Star, and the “Hare Hare Youkai” from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. This ending animation puts all of them to SHAME. The incidental music is just as funny and cool as the action it’s played over, yet it doesn’t dominate the scenes.<br />
<br />
Characters (10/10)– <br />
<br />
As with any story of this nature, it’s the characters that move things along—after all, it’s a slice of life, so the characters that we follow have to be interesting. Here’s the breakdown:<br />
<br />
Tadakuni:-<br />
<br />
The long suffering straight man of our primary bro-trio. He’s pretty average as compared to his friends Hidenori and Yoshitake, and thus is always exasperated to the point of manic over their antics…though he does have a crazy streak of his own.<br />
<br />
Hidenori Tabata:-<br />
<br />
Our glasses-wearing character of the trio. Remember that old-school Nickelodeon TV show “Kenan and Kel”? Well, he’s an animated version of Kenan. He’s this grand over-the-top character who often kicks off the crazy conversations and situations our primary bro-trio gets into.<br />
<br />
Yoshitake Tanaka:-<br />
<br />
The blond-haired [Dyed…] member of our primary bro-trio. If Hidenori is Kenan, then Yoshitake is Kel. He’s more apt to follow Hidenori’s lead with regards to crazy ideas, leaving Tadakuni to spaz out. In his youth, Yoshitake was known as the masked avenger “Rubber Shooter”, helping out those who were being bullied. In fact, though Hidenori doesn’t know it, Yoshitake actually helped him out as “Rubber [Band] Shooter” when he was being bullied. Quite commendable…even though he sits in his chair oddly.<br />
<br />
Motoharu:-<br />
<br />
Our dark skinned student council member. While he looks like he could be a juvenile delinquent, and when we first meet him, he is referred to as such, Motoharu is actually a really nice guy who gets along well with his older sister, even though she tormented him when he was younger, and her friends tend to have their way with him [not in that way you pervs…] at any given time. Motoharu is the Nichibro I relate to more than any of the others because, bless him, he doesn’t know how to ride a bike. Thankfully in his case, as well as mine, he had his bros help him out.<br />
<br />
Toshiyuki Karasawa:-<br />
<br />
Another student council member. You’ll know him by the ever-persistent cap on his head. He wears the cap to cover over a very distinct scar on his face that was given to him by a girl when he was little. Though he comes off as being very mysterious and aloof, he’s actually capable of being just as goofy as the others.<br />
<br />
There are more characters in this compendium of kooks, like the Student Council President and his Second in Command who never really seem to be in the Council Room, Tadakuni’s Little Sister who is by far one of the cruelest little sister characters in anime […Oriemo not withstanding, because I&#039;m still trying to figure out what the heck is going on there…], or the group of oddball girls from the “High School Girls are Funky” skit. Suffice it to say, they are the perfect compliment to our main cast as listed above.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10) -<br />
<br />
So where does that leave us? Daily Lives of High School Boys is about as realistic a look into the lives of teenage boys as you can get currently. It’s not willowy light like Kimi to Boku, nor is it fangirl fodder like…THAT show…it’s just an honest, hilariously funny look at the lives of some very…odd high school boys. With its funny and realistic story, entertaining characters, odd yet functional animation, jamming music, and all-star voice cast, Daily Lives of High School Boys will leave you feeling nostalgic for your high school years…and wondering if you and your friends were really as big of dorks as Tadakuni, HIdenori and Yoshitake. Nine times out of ten…you were.<br />

    We are all aware about how first impressions are a very important factor if you’re going to enjoy a show. <br />
My first impression of Danshi was it was a more annoying version of Kimi to Boku. <br />
The comedy style seems to be the same as Drifters comedy at times. That immediately turned me off from that show. <br />
<br />
What also doesn’t help is this is indeed another episodic show that I continue to have issues with. <br />
I was basically checked out by episode 8. I knew what was going on. I knew nothing was going to get better. I didn’t care for the rest of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review235767">
        show. <br />
There was a scene in episode 2 where Tibata told to ignore Tanaka. I was wondering if I should just ignore this entire show.<br />
<br />
That is another issue with this show that Tanaka and Tibata are one of the most annoying duo I’ve seen in a long time. <br />
There were some other male side characters that were watchable. But it is hard to get attached to any when you despise the main characters. <br />
There were scenes that could have been funny but I didn’t laugh because I was so checked out by then to care. <br />
I could also see they were trying to be snarky with references and taking jab at tropes. That doesn’t tickle my fancy either. <br />
I also am not interesting in seeing sisters continue to beat up on the brothers again and again and again. Not my thing. <br />
<br />
I really couldn’t understand the main concept of the show at the end either. <br />
At least with Non Non Biyori you understand the main concept of it is okay to live in the sticks. <br />
Did they want to get girlfriends? Is it a boy vs. girl competition? Or is it just pure nothingness? <br />
I felt like it was voided of any main focus I could take away from the show. <br />
<br />
If there was something I did appreciate about the show was the role reversal the show did after the completion of the ending song. <br />
It allowed me to see if it was because it was a group of boys that made it harder for me to care. <br />
What I found out is that when it is boys my impression is, well I wouldn’t want to be friends with these guys. <br />
But when it is girls my impression is I wouldn’t want to date these gals. Which ended up being worse. <br />
<br />
I do believe there is a fine line between funny and obnoxious faces and Danshi would fall under obnoxious. <br />
I’ll have to hit the art rating hard because that was mainly the only artistically thing I can talk about. <br />
Story? Was there even a story? There was a few recurring segments but no progression in them. It was pretty terrible. <br />
Then characters are terrible. My enjoyment was terrible. <br />
The show had a good opening song but a below average ending song. <br />
This show failed to bring any sort of happiness to me unfortunately. <br />

    Pros: Great comedy, short length, skit and episodic format make it easy to pick up<br />
<br />
Cons:  The skits can fall a little flat and/or be lost in translation, I personally found the Highschool girls are Funky skits to be a bit eyeroll worthy.<br />
<br />
Bottom Line: A funny series that doesn&#039;t take too much investment to watch.   Look at the first few episodes and see if the comedy clicks with you.<br />
<br />
Comedy:<br />
Daily Lives of Highschool Boys is first and foremost a comedy series.    There isn’t a lot of time spent on character development or any overarching plot.   Like Azumanga or other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review59067">
        4koma-based shows, it’s broken up into shorter skits which keep things fresh.  Even if one skit is unfunny to you, the next might be good.   It parodies anime clichés and also elements from a real teenagers life. While I’ve seen a lot of comedies flounder when it comes to that culture barrier, this one I think honestly has minimal problems (either that or I&#039;ve been watching too much anime).   I think the comedy comes off as a cross between Gintama and Azumanga.<br />
<br />
Our cast:<br />
The [male] characters don’t have extreme or wacky personalities, and as such the characters end up feeling pretty “real” even if they are doing and saying really absurd things.    The girl characters are generally given extreme personalities, and as such felt really fake.  I know some people say this is intentional and “high school boys really see high school girls as terrifying and out to get them” but eh.  I’m not so sure.  Elementary boys, sure, but in my experience teenagers are quite the opposite (wink wink).    It fell flat for me, is what I am trying to say.   Come to think of it, I’ve never seen a slice of life comedy which can portray genuine humor with both genders, so there you go.      As a satire of how girls are often depicted in anime it might work slightly better, but I still thought the Highschool Girls are Funky skits were the least enjoyable parts of the show.<br />
<br />
That ED:<br />
I’d recommend looking up the ending sequence.  It is too much fun and I sat through it every time.   <br />

    Danshi Koukousei No Nichijou - Daily life of high school boys.<br />
<br />
I always watch all-girls, co-ed slice of life, school anime. This is the first time I watch all-boys slice of life. I would expect to be boring but this anime doesn&#039;t allow me to hate it. I love it!<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10 . The story is decent for most, no ecchi scene, mostly boy&#039;s stories. It&#039;s just a slice of life. <br />
<br />
Art: 8/10. I wonder why most of the girl characters doesn&#039;t have eyes. Only few of them, but the artwork is well done.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10. OP and ED are great<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10. Funny, overreact, has good sense of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179710">
        humor. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10. I laughed so hard for every episode, it&#039;s really a funny, relaxing yet fun to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10

    What word would you choose to describe your high school days? Is it stressful, exhausting, slave-driving, or even fun in some cases?<br />
In a time period where almost every anime has some elements of school life or the words &quot;High School&quot; involved, it usually puts a damper on the experience as a whole depending on how you look at it before you may have even watched it. (Heck, even after you&#039;re dead you go back to high school according to Angel Beats). <br />
So when you have an anime centering not around the overall experience and tales of friendship that take place in a high school, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review156231">
        the quirks and antics that are possible in the lives of boys in the depth of their adolescence, what do you get?<br />
Well, insanity. That&#039;s the best word to describe Daily Lives of Highschool Boys. <br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
<br />
The title basically sums up the story the best than I ever could; it&#039;s centered around the humorous events and tales of three best friends, Tadakuni, Hidenori, and Yoshitake. It&#039;s fairly straightforward, and as this is a comedy, there are no deep or thought-provoking themes, nor does it try to take itself seriously. Quite the opposite, in fact, as this series tends to make fun of itself time and time again. They even threw a wrench into the attempt to break out of the slice-of-life genre in the first minutes of the first episode, which I greatly appreciated.<br />
Every episode is extremely episodic, with the only over-arching theme being that most of these take place in an all-boys school which our protagonists attend.  It&#039;s rather obvious that coming from a manga, there are at least 3-4 &quot;segments&quot; that the show is split up into its individual chapters. This actually works quite well, as the story doesn&#039;t ever feel overwhelming and is laid-back in its nature and presentation. Plus, as each skit is only 2-5 minutes at most, it&#039;s easy to stop and take a break at any time without feeling like you&#039;re missing anything major, because really, you&#039;re not.<br />
As for the humor itself (since I wouldn&#039;t know where else to talk about it), I would have to say that compared to other comedies, is rather crude at times, though there are never scenes where the stories or jokes are too confusing. The simplicity of the jokes themselves add to the show&#039;s charm, and the inner monologues varying from person to person just gives it so much style and enjoyment out of it. Sometimes it&#039;s completely over-the-top and exaggerated, and other times quite... quietly presented. The only con I would have to say is that though the punch lines are there, it seems pretty anti-climatic at the end of certain scenes, like there was too much build-up and not enough reaction, though that might just be a personal bias from me. <br />
Never is the comedy too girly and there&#039;s not a hint of moe to be found, which is really refreshing from your usual run-of-the-mill &quot;cute girls doing cute funny things in highschool&quot;; gender reversal is always a pleasure. The humor is crude and presented as such, and it really gives off the feel and realism that this is all coming from teenage boys going through a dumb phase, and it just suits the show and characters perfectly. I wouldn’t want it to be any other way.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8/10<br />
<br />
The characters of DLHSB are, well, exactly what they are: high school boys who fool around, get laughed at, and have no idea what they&#039;re doing in general. They give a little bit of realism to the show, but at the same time it&#039;s a bit of a downfall because with its incredibly large cast of supporting characters, things feel somewhat crowded at some points trying to remember them all. This mostly applies to the supporting characters who only show up for an episode or less and then disappear, though luckily there are only a few to be found.<br />
I think the best part about the show&#039;s reoccurring characters (outside of the main three) is how memorable they are. Even though the show&#039;s opening emphasizes the fact that there are a lot, by the end of the twelfth episode you&#039;ll be sure to remember who everyone is, which is quite an accomplishment in and of itself. But again, because they&#039;re reoccurring and the segments of this show are so short, it may be a natural thing to know who everyone is, even if not by name but rather by what kind of personality and their funniest scene was and the diversity between them is refreshing. <br />
The main trio has a great dynamic both as best friends and as a comedic group. Hidenori and Yoshitake are the two jokesters, though in different ways than one another, while Tadakuni is the classic “only sane man” out of the three. Despite the fact that some people call Tadakuni boring and not funny at all, his reactions and dialogue towards the events around him are required for a lot of the jokes to be pulled off. Their dynamics and interactions as a trio are some of the most ridiculous and entertaining ones I’ve seen in a while. It’s their conversations and idiotic plans and jokes with the outside cast that is really one of the biggest and most entertaining parts of this show.<br />
Since our cast is so incredibly large, I can’t go into too much detail about them individually, but I will spare mention for the “Literary Girl” Yassan, who is probably one of the fan-favorites (and mine as well) out of the cast for being a perfect… well, deconstruction of the classic trope of “quiet mysterious girl by the riverbank”. Extra props go to her merely for her existence, though I have to take a few points off for some unnecessary side characters here and there and not all of them are completely original but still entertaining nonetheless.  <br />
<br />
Animation: 7/10<br />
<br />
Most people’s complaints towards this show usually stem from its animation, since when watchers think to “high school shenanigans”, they’d think of something comprised from some sort of cutesy moe-style studio, see Kyoto Animation and Xebec due to their previous works. However, I personally don’t think that’s an issue here, because if the show were any… cuter, it would ruin the blunt edge that this show has as a show about /boys/ and just throw the entire thing off and look incredibly misleading. The style and the way things are drawn matches the tone and characters of the anime perfectly, and though there isn’t any particular part in the show’s runtime that I could point out as looking absolutely gorgeous, it doesn’t need to be.<br />
As for the animation itself, it’s nothing amazing and is rather standard compared to other anime today. Others may call it lackluster, but it sincerely and dutifully does everything it’s supposed to do and I never found anything to be completely impassable. Remember, this is a comedy anime. Unlike Nichijou (which happens to be the most common comparison to this show), DLHSB doesn’t have any amazing KyoAni-standard animation to flaunt whenever they happen to have it on hand. Naturally, I would always appreciate more of a visual feast when I can catch one, and it’s always a bonus, but I would be one to say that the style of animation chosen for this show isn’t really /required/ for the jokes to be played out properly. So for what it is, it’s just fine and I would rather prefer they keep this memorable style they have of drawing characters because it sets it apart to other comedies I know of. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
<br />
Ahhh, god, the sound. I’ve been waiting to review this aspect since the very first episode, but let’s start with the obvious. <br />
The music was done by the lovely person over at Audio Highs, mainly known for their previous work on the well-known and well-liked Gintama series. However, I can’t make a steady comparison as I’ve yet to listen to anything outside of that particular show. The OST doesn’t exactly have too many memorable tracks on it, or anything that I would be inclined to pick up and listen to outside of the show. But, same as the animation, it does its job and is great as accompaniment to the series, but not as a stand-alone track that I would want to put on repeat fifty times for an hour. You will probably remember a few of the lazier tracks that are played multiple times, but never did I find there to be too little music or a certain song that I loved to pieces. The OP and ED are incredibly catchy and more or less will get stuck in your head for hours after you finish the show, so if you catch me humming the opening at any given point, you have full rights to slap me upside the head.<br />
Good god. The voice acting. Where do I even begin with the voice acting. Well, to start off with, again, the obvious: this is a comedy. The voices are required to be big, bombastic, ridiculous, and overdramatic regardless of the scene.<br />
And in that very important aesthetic, Daily Lives of High School Boys delivers. Oh, so, well, might I add.<br />
Most of the time the lines and jokes themselves aren’t necessarily what makes the scenes funny; though it may apply to most shows out there, the way they are delivered and reacted to /REALLY/ picks up the slack where animation and dialogue don’t to make the scenes hilarious. Miyu Irino and Suzumura Kenichi do amazing jobs as their respective roles of Tadakuni and Yoshitake, especially given the fact that the two haven’t done too much in terms of comedy shows. <br />
But then there’s Hidenori, who was oh-so-BEAUTIFULLY voiced by the comedy god; none other than Sugita Tomokazu himself. Maybe this just comes from my personal bias and opinion, but his obvious famous role as Sakata Gintoki really prepped him up wonderfully to deliver some of the most enjoyable and laughable lines in the entire show. Just listening to him say anything as Hidenori made me want to cry with laughter simply because of how well they were delivered. I have to say that out of the entire cast for this show, Sugita Tomokazu is definitely the shining star of any and all of the actors, despite there being, well, a lot of them. Even though the OST isn’t anything remarkable the sound score is automatically pushed up to a nine just because of the stellar voice acting.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment and Final Verdict: 9<br />
<br />
The key point to enjoying this show (and many others that exist) is to not take it seriously, which isn’t too hard in this case. It’s not an anime I would recommend to absolutely everyone, since I know comedy isn’t everyone’s cup of tea and neither are episodic series. However, it really doesn’t take much to have fun watching this, since chances are you will laugh at least once unless this type of anime really doesn’t stand out to you. Sure, it’s not perfect, since nothing ever is, but as a comedy that is meant purely for entertainment value, it’s a light-hearted, episodic show that will do you just fine as far as shows like Nichijou go. <br />
Its major shining points are its character interactions and the presentation of the jokes, all of which is held strongly together with amazing voice acting and over-the-top characters that are a delight to view on screen. The animation and music is simplistic but does their jobs well enough for there to be nothing cringe-worthy to be found. The only downfalls that I can personally find is the lack of detail put into farther-placed frames and character designs, plus a few unnecessary side characters (usually who are females), but it doesn’t take away too much from DLHSB in general. But the main reason why I would tell anyone to watch this is because of its take on the high school slice-of-life genre and its incredibly amusing gender reversal, because this thing really does not give two shits about dainty girls and the classic stereotypes in the way it presents itself. <br />
So if you’re looking for a casual, not-to-be-taken-seriously-or-thought-about comedy with amusing characters, outstanding voice acting, and a few deconstructions of moe and the usual tropes of high school based anime, or even if you’re just looking for a few laughs, Daily Lives of Highschool Boys certainly does not fail to deliver, and I personally had tons of fun watching it, and I hope you do too. <br />

    M&#039;kay, this kinda bored the crap outta me, now I know that there are those of you out there who totally love this type of genre but I wasnt feeling this at all. <br />
Imagine some camera crew following you around all day filming everything you do, now maybe that would be awesome; but if your life isnt any more exciting than mine, it would be a pretty shitty show. So this is supposed to be daily lives, but as a highschool boy (or near enough) I know that my experience was waaay different from this and I wasnt able to relate to anything going on.<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review88045">
        story, thinner than anorexia; the characthers, pretty boring; the overall enjoyment, I didnt really feel any. <br />
Well, right now Im being a big downer, so lets get to something positive. The ending was actually really good (perhaps because I was just so happy to be done with this) it was surprisingly touching, the only problem is that you have to sit through six hours of boredom before you get there.<br />
As an ending note: I might have been a dick and offended some people in this review, if I did, it was not my intent.

    The story actually does not deserve a 10, but each episode had its own individual story that was pretty creative and all-out hilarious. This was probably the funniest anime I&#039;ve seen, especially the starting scene. The opening song is great and the characters are really likable. This is not a sentimental anime that will make you cry, but just a comedic anime made for laughs. If you just want a funny anime this is my favorite. <br />
Edit: I&#039;ve rewatched clips of this show over and over again on Youtube and it still never gets old. However, if you aren&#039;t immediately into the sort of comedy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181226">
        given by the first couple scenes then I suggest dropping it as it won&#039;t be as enjoyable for you.

    Words cannot describe the ingenuity behind what seems to be very common and ordinary everyday practices that we sees them as &#039;jokes&#039;. Every single skits have been re-watched more than my re-watch of Christopher Nolan&#039;s Batman films and the Star Trek series. The show has me grinning like a fool for hours to end, even after I&#039;ve finished the show and wished for a season 2. <br />
<br />
I also like how the simplicity of the art style adds up more volume to the humor, especially when it comes to characters expressions from time to time and does not rely on over-the-top moe characteristic for the audience

    This anime is obviously about High School Boys and their daily lives, or should I say, the highlights of their daily lives? <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a really good anime with lots of weird and awkward moments, which will make you smile and laugh.<br />
<br />
Story: 7 of 10<br />
<br />
There is no exact plot in this anime, but only short story arcs in each episode. Each arc contains some of the characters, either in their High School Building, by the riverbank, or in Tadakuni&#039;s house, convenience store etc. Each arc is quite short but funny, albeit the endings aren&#039;t that good. Each arc may just end as if they&#039;re on square

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194693">
        one again, leading to nothing at all. Most of the times, you won&#039;t be able to see what actually happens. One character hits another but then, the ending is just with a picture of what happened, with the person in the pictures voice saying &quot;Daily Lives of High School boys&quot;, in weird voices. I think that they have chosen to do it like that to simplify things by not having to animate more scenes for each arc. I think that the stories need some development, some of them do get a bit tiring. I personally still like it though, because it shows just the daily mundande activites of teenagers. After the ending of each episode, you&#039;ll get a glimpse of daily lives of &quot;Funky High School Girls&quot;. But the daily life isn&#039;t always funfilled. <br />
<br />
Art: 6 of 10<br />
<br />
The art is very simple, the character designs are similar to each other, there are nearly no wardrobe change (they all have their school unforms on). This is a bit disappointing, but it&#039;s understandable because it&#039;s often about their lives as High School Boys/Girls. The colour leans toward pastel colours, making it look like a shoujo anime. But that didn&#039;t put me off, I personally love it! Too bright colours wouldn&#039;t have made it into a slice of life anime. The movements of the characters are a bit akward, though it&#039;s nothing to worry about! <br />
<br />
Sound: 6 of 10<br />
I didn&#039;t like the opening song nor the ending song, they weren&#039;t that catchy either. They were quite average and sounds like typical anime songs (pop song). <br />
<br />
Character: 9 of 10<br />
<br />
The character designs weren&#039;t that good, but I really liked all the characters. Each of them had their quirks; Tadakuni, the &quot;too&quot; normal guy, Hidenori, the glasses guy who looks really boring but is one of those who will make you laugh. His voice actor is really good! And then we have an anime character who looks like a middle aged man, but is actually 17 year old. All of them are one or another very considerate of others feelings, especially girls. They sometimes try to not point out things, for example when getting the wrong amount of change and not saying anything because they don&#039;t want the cashier to get into trouble. They do small kind deeds that actually makes you like them. They aren&#039;t stereotypically dirtyminded, though panties are something that pops up here and there xD<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10 of 10<br />
<br />
This is one of those rare animes where you can&#039;t help but enjoy every scene, every character and their weird but somehow cute behaviours. They make you laugh, and also, makes you cherish your everyday life. Some parts may be a bit boring, but, in the end, you always get a funfilled ride in every episode. Though none of the endings left me satisifed: This anime is addictive. <br />
<br />
Overall: 9 of 10<br />
Bottomline: A feel good anime, with lots of laughters and not so daily blunders and moments!<br />
<br />

    Ah, slice-of-life. If you are not one to enjoy putting yourself into the character&#039;s shoes... well you should at least give it a try for this anime. Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is quite different from other comedy anime because rather than having a continuous plot, it has various skits. I am not exaggerating when I say this is my all-time favorite comedy anime (I have not watched Gintama yet so maybe my opinion will change).<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
Although there is no real constant plot, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou does not fail to implement various, entertaining scenarios. Each skit is not too short and most importantly catches my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review163509">
        interest. Laughing at a bunch of mischievous boys doing the most uncanny things, what else do you want from an anime with this title!? Also, each skit contributes to future skits in later episodes which is probably the only connection between the episodes.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
I have to admit, at first the art was not extremely appealing to me - the background is usually quite bland, colors don&#039;t stand out, and character designs were typical, and some minor characters (mostly females) didn&#039;t even have faces drawn. However, after delving deeper into the show, I found that each character was uniquely drawn. By the end of the anime, you may be referring to the characters by &quot;that guy with that hat&quot; or the &quot;dark-skinned blond guy&quot;! Another great thing which I loved about the art was the FACIAL EXPRESSION. My god, the overemphasis of their reactions are priceless and send me to a hysterical trance every. single. time.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
The sound is just average. They don&#039;t really stand out but on some occasions, the background music does bring laughter. This is because certain skits have a specific soundtrack and whenever the music pops up again and that skit made you laugh before, you&#039;ll have a smile on your face and nothing has even happened yet!<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
All of the characters are funny. Although some of the them may have stereotypical &quot;comedy character&quot; personalities, traits, etc., the other various characters balance it out. Most of the characters are males; however, near the end of some episodes there will be a short skit involving female characters who do contribute to the main story. Some of them are annoying, especially the voices, but that does&#039;t detract the laughter. If you are looking for dynamic characters then this anime may not be for you. I did not see any dramatic changes in the characters so if you were looking for a character you could relate to who becomes a better version of himself, eh... sorry.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
I can certainly say I enjoyed this anime. I looked forward to it whenever a new episode came out. It was so enjoyable I had to write a review for it years later! Although comedy anime is usually a love or hate, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s even possible to hate this anime unless you don&#039;t like skits and prefer an actual plot.<br />
<br />
Overall, despite not having a perfect score on any criteria except enjoyment, I gave this anime a whooping 10/10. Why? I enjoyed it. I enjoyed every single second I spent watching this show instead of doing homework or getting outside to get some sunlight. I re-watched it a second time when I introduced it to my friends for goodness&#039; sake! If by the end of this review this anime still doesn&#039;t intrigue you, eh... what can I do? I&#039;m just saying you&#039;re going to be missing out! If you watched the first episode and still aren&#039;t hooked, I guess it&#039;s just not for you. Comedy is subjective and I guess you&#039;ll find better laughter in some other anime.

    I haven&#039;t seen many anime to begin with, and I sure as hell did not know what to expect from a highschool themed anime after series like FMA:Brotherhood, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Death Note and the likes.<br />
<br />
But I must say, this surprised me alot. I thought something like DKN would have bad humor, recurring boring situations, and overall nothing all too fancy for enjoyment. I was wrong.<br />
<br />
The comedy and satire is excellent, the characters have great, well, character in them, all in all being very different which adds to the enjoyment and interactions between any particular character combination were very well-written and professionally acted. Again, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review159407">
        don&#039;t know much about what a good anime is, but this is my personal review and damn I loved it.<br />
<br />
The art is very neat, as to be expected from a newer anime (such as FMA:Brotherhood which had a similar neatness imo), and matches the style of the show. Like I said earlier, the voice acting is superbly done, and paired with the typical exaggerated facial expressions it made my past few days very enjoyable.<br />
<br />
I do not think that 10/10 would be overdoing it, I seriously found no flaws for me. Some jokes are of course predictable, but I wouldn&#039;t really think rating it less cause of that is justifiable.<br />
<br />
In any case, I recommend this. I&#039;m a 21y/o guy with what seemed to be zero interest in themes like high school, yet I am here rating this as an excellent anime. Have fun.

    First off, I died watching this show. If you&#039;re looking for a comedic anime this one is pure gold. The situations or little skits it shows, will most likely crack you up because its just stupid. Though the show doesn&#039;t really have much of a plot it mostly just exist for comedic purposes. <br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t really see the anime having any problems besides not having a plot, but it doesn&#039;t really need one for the type of anime it is. I can almost guarantee you will like this show if you give it a shot. If you want something that will make you laugh then

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215881">
        this is probably it. If it doesn&#039;t then sorry guess it&#039;s just your type of humor. <br />
<br />
Definitely the funniest anime I&#039;ve ever seen. Give this one a try, it could become one of your favorite anime!

    One thing “Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou”, or “Daily Lives of High School Boys” taught me is that high school boys acting silly is a universal occurrence.  If you’ve ever been a part of a tight-knit group of friends while growing up, then DLoHSB is something you should watch.  It’s an atypical Shouen anime that revels in the camaraderie, trivial conflicts, and the general antics one engages in as an immature young male.<br />
<br />
DLoHSB is a comedy that follows a group of friends as they simply live their lives.  That’s it.  It’s serialized in the least possible way; every episode consists of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175789">
        series of short, comedic vignettes that may or may not be revisited as the series progresses.  So those looking for an overarching narrative that begins in the first episode and satisfyingly concludes in the final episode might want to look elsewhere.  What DLoHSB does offer is an abundance of laughter.  As we all know, comedy is subjective, so whether or not this anime works for you depends largely on how funny you find the characters and the situations they find themselves in.<br />
<br />
The anime introduces a plethora of characters, but the main group consists of Tadakuni, Hidenori, and Yoshitake.   The three of them are childhood friends, all of whom attend the same all-boys academy.  Even though the anime makes you think Tadakuni is the main character, it focuses on Hidenori a lot more.  Left and right, the anime constantly subverts your expectations, and more often than not, it plays a huge factor in making the comedic elements work.  These guys mess around every chance they get; sometimes they stop their walk home to engage in some LARP, other times they wear the underwear of Tadakuni’s little sister.  And don’t think for a second that Tadakuni has a little sister complex or that the other two are just depraved little boys.  He doesn’t and they aren’t, they’re just crazy like that.<br />
<br />
The segment that involves them wearing underwear is called, “High School Boys and Skirts”.  Every segment has the same “High School Boys and X” naming scheme, in which one or all three of them comment or interact with something or someone (so many “ORs”!).  However, it’s not always the three of them – boys from their school’s student council get in on the action, too.  But make no mistake; every segment is from a male perspective.  Although that’s not entirely true, because most of the episodes are post-scripted with a female-centric short called “High School Girls are Funky”.  Basically they’re saying, “Girls are equally crazy and immature!”, and after watching them, they’re absolutely right.  <br />
<br />
The structure of the episodes makes them go past quick.  If you didn’t find a particular segment funny, odds are you’ll find the next one hilarious.  A lot of them were absurd, but they all have a recognizable honesty to them.  While the absurd moments were funny in and of themselves, I found myself laughing the most during those “it’s so true” moments.  Moments like awkwardly trying to sound cool in front of a girl, or being emasculated by your older sister.  Even if the humor didn’t work, I still found something relatable about the situation.  It’s easy to see everything not humorously hitting its mark for everyone, but when it does, it’s painfully funny.  I could easily watch an entire series dedicated to “High School Boy and Literary Girl.”<br />
<br />
DLoHSB is animated fairly well, and its animation definitely helps to accentuate the comedic moments.  Usually at the punch-line of a joke, backgrounds and character reactions are exaggerated to drive home the point.  However, what I found most interesting from an artistic perspective is that the majority of females characters lack eyes.  It could be because we’re seeing them from the perspective of the Hidenori &amp; co., and the only girls with eyes are the ones they identify with the most, such as Yassan (Literary Girl).  Or, it could be because girls are icky!  Whatever the case, I liked their decision to go that route, as it makes the series unique.<br />
<br />
As previously mentioned, DLoHSB doesn’t have a series-long plot to resolve, yet at the end, you do get a sense of closure.  Despite all the mindless shenanigans, you feel as if the characters learned a valuable lesson they’ll eventually apply going forward.  DLoHSB is primarily aimed towards males, but everyone should be able to find something identifiable about it - either as the victim or the offender in one of its many comedy shorts.  Male or female, if you like subversive, self-aware comedy with funny and likable characters, then, yeah, watch this!<br />

    Greatest comedy I&#039;ve watched so far. This anime was realized me how precious the friendship is.<br />
Well the first episode was very good to me and made me dying because of laughs. It&#039;s like forced me to watch more, more and even more. Sadly I ended it so soon. (I hope for more though)<br />
Sometimes it reminds me to my old junior highschool friends, we often did some idiot stuffs like the anime does... Yeah overall is very good and really worth to be watched!
