    The Youjo Senki Movie is a mixture of historical anomalies, self-reflective commentaries on the perpetual cycle of death and war in human history and the persistent yet noble personal battle which our main character Tanya puts up against what&#039;s effectively the God of this world (Or Being X, if you will). <br />
All whilst stuck in the body of a young girl. Sounds like your kind of thing? Then welcome, to the &quot;Saga of Tanya the Evil&quot; (movie)! <br />
<br />
Tanya as a series was made by Studio NUT, a relatively new studio comprised of passionate individuals willing to work their ass of for their craft. I recently

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303258">
        had the pleasure of visiting Japan to see this movie and on the trip I took a detour to visit the official Youjo Senki café (a 1-floor detour). Lots and lots of memorabilia from the series could be found, including a functional suit of battle gear which Tanya wears in the series &amp; movie. Slick, gritty &amp; beautiful key-art littered the area, and it made me even more stoked to see the movie. The passion in each frame could be seen before I even entered cinema and my anticipation and excitement was met with a bombastic balls-to-the-walls historical action-adventure with the same cast of characters we all fell in love with back in season 1. This time... introducing the communists! <br />
<br />
As an enemy to Tanya and the &quot;Eternal Empire&quot; they were far more fearsome than the psuedo-French of last season. Not that they didn&#039;t do their job back then (and they do show up in the movie), but in comparison the size and scope of the Russian federation could be felt thanks to a combination of striking visual symbolism &amp; an attentive composer doing his best to ease you into an underlying feeling of dread which permeated throughout the entire movie. Similar musical motifs are used from season 1, but they&#039;re given a real &quot;Hans Zimmer&quot; treatment (Hans Zimmer of 10 years ago that is) Calm piano pieces, high octane trumpets &amp; an ill-boding pipe organ are all examples of instruments used to help elevate the score to greater cinematic heights.<br />
<br />
In the end this was worth waiting for. The animation still looks crisp and beautiful, even more so with a movie budget. The characters and VA&#039;s all work perfectly, some of the new ones give off more of an impression thanks to their VA&#039;s (All veterans, like Cho &amp; Toshiyuki Morikawa) <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not going to go into spoilers, but the ending gave me shivers. In what way I won&#039;t tell, but they make fine use of directing choices to present a suggestion to both the audience and characters... that is very interesting.<br />
<br />
Myth &amp; Roid&#039;s new song is pretty great too, more subdued &amp; ominous.

    Spoiler-Free Review!<br />
<br />
The long-awaited sequel is here and oh boy was it good, overall the movie was action-packed and had some character development for our new characters. More importantly, we see the continuation of the saga of Tanya. <br />
<br />
The movie explains the next involvement of characters like our new anti-protagonist Aka Mary Sue, the daughter of Anson Sioux (Aka the guy who had the fucking trench shotgun in season 1). <br />
<br />
It takes a turn and goes ahead into the story but introduces her &quot;upbringing&quot; and what type of character she is. The movie also shows what we can expect from the next season(which is going to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308577">
        be a thing) which I&#039;m excited about. <br />
<br />
The quality was overall great like other films that were movie based. I was lucky to watch it in theatres and would recommend anyone to watch the movie first if that wasn&#039;t obvious then the second season due to the fact its canon. <br />
<br />
The movie did leave me unsatisfied due to the short introduction of how are characters met but that&#039;s cause I wanted more but I can respect the hour and a half for the time to introduce the next characters and what they did to meet our current MC.<br />
<br />
Studio NUT did a fantastic job with the new OST which was pretty impressive and the overall art of the show. Yuuki Aoi did a good job as well the new voice actors especially the VA that played Mary Sue. In between shots they did use CGI and was a bit of an eyesore in a few scenes but that was only a quick scene, easily ignorable. <br />
<br />
Back to the new OST like I said it was good but also the action-packed scenes in the movies with that music really made me immersed. No spoilers :3<br />
<br />
The movie was overall good and it filled that hole that wanted more of our loli &quot;nazi&quot;. As the day of this review, it was a one day premier so it might take a while for you guys to see it but it&#039;ll be something to look forward to definitely.

    Just personal scratch.<br />
Advised, possible spoilers.<br />
Opinion &amp; Informal<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The anatomy and proportions checked out and no noticeable changes in these two points were made between the main series and this movie. There weren&#039;t any special panoramics or expanses that were showcased. There were a few environmental and nature elements in this movie but they weren&#039;t particularly focused on or given their own scenes for us to admire any sort of artistic skill in that regards. The few instances where there was living foliage and nature that we got looked pretty nice but not something I&#039;d praise; much of what was actually relevant was city-scapes and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308581">
        familiar grey, dull, and war-torn battlefields that were prevalent in the main series. However, the urban art was excellent. I really liked how nicely detailed and styled the backdrops and artwork for the urban areas looked; it felt like the style was more something out of a painting: not clean and crisp, but had an air of vintage if that makes sense. The character details remained fairly close to the main series art-quality-wise. Characters like Tanya and Serebryakova looked very clean and crisp but background fodder like the nameless soldiers were either very basic or just not-too-impressive cgi models. The cgi elements weren&#039;t terrible, but were mediocre enough to sometimes pull me away from the impressive art and animation. Overall, what I thought of the art was that other than particular impact moments like action scenes or scenes emphasizing the revelations or expressions of Tanya, the art quality was more or less similar to the main series.<br />
<br />
Animation: 9/10<br />
This is what I&#039;d expect from a feature length film. While the majority of the general motions and natural movements of the characters such as body language, shifts in motion or stance, or walking had similar quality of that from the main series (I watched the BD releases), the parts that mattered such as the impact sequences during the battles or Tanya&#039;s gesugao asides looked great and were what I&#039;d expect from a movie release. In the battle department, this movie did not disappoint. I was wholey satisfied with the animation for the battles. The cgi elements during the &quot;big budget&quot; battles such as Tanya&#039;s duel were kept to a minimum or presented in a way that didn&#039;t detract from the experience at all. Overall, the animation for everything but the &quot;big budget&quot; scenes are pretty much the same as what you&#039;d see in the main series. However, the reason I gave this area such a good score was how impressive (or, well, how satisfied I was) the impact sequences were.   <br />
<br />
Characters, Plot &amp; Development: 6/10<br />
The characters were the same from the main series. This movie didn&#039;t put too much mileage towards developing any of the characters too deeply (or at all) or any of their relationships or dynamics. No backstories or personal development was allotted to any of the characters at all other than what we were already aware of from the main show, not even Tanya or Mary Sue. Moreover, the direction of the development was more of the main show&#039;s formula giving me the impression that this movie was just a high-budget OVA. I understand that the nature of the the circumstances that the Empire is in as well as Tanya&#039;s place in it all leaves little to deviate from (they can&#039;t just ignore the war to introduce some crazy plot just for the movie) but the reason I gave this area a 6 is because of that. It was just more of sending Tanya and her troops to areas that needed help or carrying out decisive missions. Mary Sue, the antagonist in this movie, was just there to serve as the bad guy. There were moments where the story could have touched upon heavier questions or ideas such as the topics of revenge (during Mary Sue&#039;s conversation with her superior in the barracks or between Tanya and Mary in the church), human nature, or morality versus following orders. Many of those opportunities were there, but were given the &quot;It&#039;s my job, therefore I must do it&quot; or &quot;I am angry or I am fighting because the Empire is evil&quot; explanation. This development direction in my opinion shunted all of my sympathy for Mary Sue. Mary Sue&#039;s anger and resentment didn&#039;t &quot;feel&quot; heavy and I found it hard to connect with her emotions. I feel that the movie failed to give me any sort of foundation or something to work with to humanize Mary Sue and her anger other than the 5 seconds of flashbacks of animation from the main show. Tanya was just more Tanya. She was still acting in accordance to her goal of finding an easy life and simply trying to survive her circumstances. There weren&#039;t any moments of conscientious growth, personal revelations, or shifts in personality for Tanya in this movie which is fine, but there wasn&#039;t even any of those wonderful debates with Being X in this movie. Overall, the characters were the same and weren&#039;t given any backgrounds or personal growth that we don&#039;t already know from the main show. Their inter-personal relationships and dynamics were exactly the same too. The plot development had the same sortie-based + aftermath direction as the main show in which Tanya and her squad would roll out, come back, and we would get the political and wartime aftermath; not much experimentation was done such as trying to at least dive into a bit of Mary Sue&#039;s psyche and its relevance to how it stems from a cycle of hate. <br />
<br />
Music: 7/10<br />
I wasn&#039;t too happy with the music and bgm as they were mostly the same as from the main show with no new notable additions. However, I gave this area a 7 because I was really happy with how well the soundboard was used. The battles really popped out and felt alive with how much was going on. The gun sounds, explosions, and battlefield noises sounded good and made those scenes feel good. No sound design to note. The ED credits used the same ED from the anime, but had different showcase art which was a treat since I liked those so much.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: 6/10<br />
The conclusion was an open-ended conclusion that&#039;s like something you&#039;d see from an OVA or special episode which is why I mentioned that this movie felt more like a high-budget OVA than a separate special entity in the universe. While I see the value in being more closely in-tune to the atmosphere of the main anime as well as that the nature of this movie is a sequel, the movie&#039;s conclusion left much to be desired and felt a bit anti-climactic. The fact that the &quot;How did it come to this?&quot; gag was used for the conclusion added to the &quot;OVA&quot; feeling. The conclusion setting up the future for &#039;more of the same&#039; felt underwhelming to me. <br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
I wasn&#039;t exactly sure what I was expecting from this movie coming into it, but I can definitely say that some parts weren&#039;t surprising while others were satisfying. The direction decision to stay more true to the formula of the anime and source material was fine by me; it wasn&#039;t surprising, but because of that I wasn&#039;t &quot;wow&#039;d.&quot; However, I was completely and utterly satisfied with the impressive art quality and animation, especially the impact sequences and battles. What I thought of this movie: It&#039;s more of the same from the anime, just flashier battles and better animation; this movie doesn&#039;t attempt to experiment with the source material and doesn&#039;t really try to touch upon any of the intricacies of morality or any tough questions which is why I only thought this movie was just good but not great.

    The long awaited sequel to the Youjo Senki series, this movie brings in a new character and antagonist to light. Once again, our sociopathic salaryman loli finds herself in a complex predicament reminiscent of our world’s historical world wars, facing the interference of being x at the worst possible times. Like the original series, Tanya’s squad 203 sets out to face enemies that appears impossible to win against, according to their political and strategic heads, and the battles are reflective of the nature of difficulty.<br />
<br />
In this movie, we are shown a more emotional side of Tanya. There are some scenes in the movie where she

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308574">
        even has “human” moments, which is a stark contrast to her original series presentation. You can look forward to some subtle times of hesitation on the battlefield for reasons you’ll have to watch the movie to find out about. If you watch carefully, you may even notice some moments of increased leniency towards her men. This movie seems to prepare for a new season where the anime begins to dissect her as a character. For some reason, Tanya also makes a ton of communist jokes throughout the movie, which made the people in my theater laugh a lot. (Something tells me the plot&#039;s writer really dislikes communists)<br />
<br />
The graphics were pretty much the same as the original series graphics with no real addition in quality that I noticed. Like I said in my original review of the series, they’re pretty good overall and I’d give them an 8/10. <br />
<br />
The only difference between the characters in the series and the characters in the movie is the new main antagonist who appears to be what the next season will focus on.<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it to anybody who enjoyed the first season. This is not a recap and is all fresh material, so you will need to watch the original series in order to understand what is happening in this movie. <br />
<br />
Watch it!

    While the movie I feel is good, I am somewhat disappointed at it. It pains me to say this since i&#039;m a big Tanya fan. One of my big problems for the movie is that, while the movie is action packed, battles are quite often short or skipped, then summarised. I feel like I was constantly being teased with those battles with really no pay off until the final big battle. Another problem I have is with charactor growth/arc. I don&#039;t want to spoil anything so I won&#039;t go into details. I feel like the main atagonist Mary Sue&#039;s arc was just way to speed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316766">
        up. She went from trainee to Tanya&#039;s level super fast and without us seeing much growth other then like 1 skimirish. I also feel the ending wasn&#039;t very satasifying as it mainly serves to setup for another sequel.<br />
<br />
The animations and visuals with the movie budget certainly improved and looks very good. However, this might just be a personal preference of my, but I still don&#039;t really like the character designs. As I much prefer the Manga character designs. <br />
<br />
<br />
While I at the end enjoyed the movie overall, there is just too lot&#039;s of problems that I dislikes. I think they just tyed to cover too much things into one movie, thus lot&#039;s of things feel rushed to me. <br />

    A few months late to writing a review. Youjo Senki&#039;s film debut offers the same great animation, humour, story and action that fans of the series have come to expect, dialled up to 100. The film manages to encapsulate everything that&#039;s great about Youjo Senki and is fun throughout. I was certainly not disappointed.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re into the LN series, the film covered book 5 and did so really well. The fight between Tanya and Mary Sue is one of the best animated fights I&#039;ve ever seen, there&#039;s some really cool first person viewpoints similar to DBS Broly, and this rivalry looks to be the main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312847">
        plot-point of season 2.<br />
<br />
My only regret is that more people were not able to see the film due to Crunchyroll&#039;s limited one day release.  I was luckily able to do so and am really glad, as it is definitely a great film. Hopefully with the success of this and Isekai Quartet, we will get a season 2 somewhere down the line soon.<br />
<br />
Another cool note, the director stated that Youjo is for true otaku&#039;s, even inside Japan, so if you are a big fan, congrats you are the real mccoy! <br />
<br />
Youjo Senki launches on Blu Ray and DVD on 23rd August so be sure to pickup a copy when you can.

    I&#039;ll keep it short.<br />
<br />
- The story mainly concerns a World War that seems to have aspects from both the World Wars in our world. Literally nothing else happens. Some really like this premise, anyways, but I don&#039;t see what&#039;s so great about it. <br />
<br />
- The art and animation does not disappoint since this does have a movie budget. <br />
<br />
- The same OST and ending from the anime. I liked them both and the OP.<br />
<br />
- I don&#039;t like the only main character and all the side characters are her subordinates whose only personality is being a soldier and a drinking addiction. We see some higher officers

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354270">
        too, but I didn&#039;t see much in them, either.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: Didn&#039;t like it very much, and even most of the fans would agree that the main antagonist&#039;s motive is really cliché. I had to take multiple breaks watching the movie, since I just couldn&#039;t get into it. I sat through the last 30 minutes, though, since there was a really cool mid-air gunfight.

    ITS FINALLY BACK!!!!!<br />
<br />
The amazing Youjo Senki series is finally back with our lovely Tanya Degurechaff being calculating and evil as ever. If you thought the series was epic and bombastic then the movie doubles that easily. The action, explosions and emotions are tripled, giving an amazing experience of war and destruction. <br />
<br />
I find it really interesting how many of the battles of Youjo Senki have clear similarities to real life battles that occurred in world war 2. I&#039;m really happy Youjo Senki has this setting as so little anime actually explore war and the world war so getting a sequel to the series is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316670">
        god send. The movie is set in Russia (or whatever they call it in the movie) and they really amplify the struggles of fighting them towards the end of the film. In this movie we get to see Tanya genuinely struggle with fighting an enemy (not that she didn&#039;t in the series its just amplified here).<br />
<br />
The returning characters are back with some new additions such as the new rival to Tanya, Mary who goes above and beyond her father in terms of power and threat. I find Mary really interesting as she&#039;s just an honest girl trying to avenge her father. I wont spoil anything but she makes some of the best scenes in the movie. Of course we also have Tanya who seems more upbeat in the movie cracking jokes here and there and generally having more fun with what she&#039;s doing. Of course when she&#039;s not getting impossible missions from HQ that is. Tanya&#039;s reactions are still beautiful to witness with her over the topness and the super talent behind her, Yuki Aoi who does an amazing job as always of portraying this calculating and psychotic loli.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is amazing with all the best coming back from the series. My personal favourite which they play at the beginning and end of the original series when Tanya grins at the beginning is back as well. Every time I hear that track I cant stop myself from grinning from ear to ear.<br />
<br />
Youjo Senki being one of my favourite series I couldn&#039;t wait to see this movie. Finally getting to watch it after about 5 months of waiting was completely worth it. I really hope they continue this series so we can get a conclusion and continuation of Tanya&#039;s struggles against god.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a Youjo Senki fan or just love war anime I&#039;d HIGHLY recommend watching the movie and the series if you haven&#039;t already.<br />
<br />
9/10 I&#039;m definitely re-watching this movie again.<br />

    The anticipated sequel of Youjo Senki has finally arrived &amp; starts off immediately from where it left off (along with some “spoilers” of the future events). From start to finish, the movie has Tanya kicking butts left &amp; right, the Infamous loli smile and Tanya kicking butts again but this time with style. Although the story and characters felt pretty bland to me but had a great time watching it nevertheless.<br />
 <br />
Story:2/10<br />
<br />
In all honesty, the movie felt like a filler rather than an actual arc happening. It was more of a  transition period for the series to move on to the next arc with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review352536">
        little to no plot progression. Besides, the apparent parallel with real world event( WW2 to be exact) as the story progressed made most of the future events predictable. Moreover, the reality of war and it’s effect which were somewhat presented in s1 were barely touched upon making the overall story dull and uninteresting. The only good part of the story seems to start near the end making this whole arc seem like a filler one.<br />
<br />
Character:2/10<br />
<br />
Youjo Senki was never a character focused show as even in season 1, the only interesting character of the show was Tanya and this movie made it more of an one character show despite it’s attempt to introduce a “rival” of Tanya and have more interactions between Tanya’s squad which at the end felt pretty pointless. But we get to learn some interesting thoughts of Tanya about communist regime(Yes, we have commies and even the chad Stalin himself) which in her words were something along the lines of “Totalitarian with zero brain cells” despite her being part of the “fascist reich”. Furthermore, It was good to see her humane side although rare but it was there subtly throughout the show which hopefully foreshadows her big developments as a character in the sequel.<br />
<br />
Animation:8/10<br />
<br />
The animation was more or less what one can expect from a movie. From gorgeous art of ww2 era fighter planes, bombers to the mage and dogfights were some of the best parts of the show. Especially fighter plane vs mage fights were really well done in terms of camera movement to outstanding animation. Although there were some “poor” use of cgi’s here and there, <br />
most of the fights were on point.<br />
<br />
Sound:8/10<br />
<br />
Yoshikazu Iwanami did a perfect job in this department. The fight scenes became more impactful due to the on point soundtrack and osts. Just wish that there were some more new osts for the movie. Almost all of them were more or less modified version of s1 osts.<br />
<br />
Tanya moment:10/10 (MANDATORY!!!!)<br />
#POSSIBLE_SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Best part of the show! From her “evil loli” laugh to sleepy Tanya, she was as always the best part of the show(As it should be!). Also it was great to hear her say ”f** ‘em commies” while flying over “the red square” burning everything and waving the fatherland’s flag haha.<br />
<br />
Rating : 6/10<br />
<br />
N.B. Hope you enjoyed reading my first review at MAL. Thank you!!!!<br />

    In the approximate time it takes Tanya to turn a battle around I saw the series and the movie lol.<br />
<br />
If we talk about the plot we find a mix between a warlike environment about a supposed world war in an isekai, and whether or not you want it is an interesting plot for two genres not innovative, but if striking and entertaining if they are developed correctly.<br />
<br />
Speaking of development, we find something entertaining and unfortunately at the same time repetitive at some points, surely everything has given us the feeling you want it or not: she and her battalion destroying everything without problems wherever they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333909">
        go and a final &quot;antagonist&quot; who is blessed with divine grace to give them up the butt a bit (fight fire with fire).<br />
<br />
But as I said, thanks to a good development, the few points that are repeated do not affect the series in an alarming way and make sure that the plot does not choke you thanks to those outcomes that, with good animation, manage to intrigue you enough to see how it will look. the following denouement and especially in this film where the combats have been much more intensified by a good animation that has given life to these aerial combats.<br />

And finally the point that staggers between the worst and the best at the same time. It is about the little development of the characters that surround our protagonist and that carries a great weight for the main character since by the time we get bored the series could go down. And what I am trying to say is that Tanya has been a crucial point for the series and if such a character were in the series it could not be the same even close (imagine a kind and generous protagonist like all of that isekais… I gag just think about it) Thanks to Tanya and his excessive selfishness for &quot;a 12-year-old girl&quot;, which fits perfectly for the plot, helps to intensify through the script those moments where his knowledge gets ridiculed or surprised the high command even creating that essence through the ridicule or the epic moments that manages to give it those touches that startle.

Way too much! An overwhelming battle scene, and i really like the concept of the war. Simple, but full of art, full of determination, full of dilemma! Once again, my beloved little bitchy evil bring another victory to my dearest empire. She regret it at the end tho. But still, what a brilliant combat she brought for the glory of the empire! They even really bring the description over a nation with the USSR nation concept to the show. It have foreshadowed before, however they apperance in this movies really give me a little heart attack! They did change it into the Federation names, its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332771">
        somehow bring me more joy to the whole series!<br />
<br />
Look at Tanya reaction. How she really hates a communist being, while at another side, her attitude toward God so same to the communist itself (idk if this all correlated, but, its my own opinion). Like, wtf with her? Can you shut up? Later at the end of show, she get a real carma, the cursed fate, her super power now get really pressure, got outleague by new monster in the girl suit! Yes, that girl, an avengeful strong girl!<br />
<br />
With the time being forward, I got more into loving her personalisations. Like her reactions toward some battle fury. A good command with the body of kid, she show who the boss is. Her devillish aura never vanish. Even at the complex situations. Idk tho, if that was pure lucky, or her fate to die not at the right time. But still, she was really a solid being of genius little kid (yeah, she was officially not origin from there, but still, the soul from before really fit well for the situation at the world war. Too good to be true, eh?). <br />
<br />
Damn, why this movies not come with more long duration? Gah, no complain at all. The LN still continue tho. So i need to put my restrain wait into another level. Lets see how Tanya end her cursed fate! And lets see how the whole Empire nations problem of war, bring their fortune toward another decade to decade to come! Yes, i may discuss the first scene. But, it is rather just my plain hunch or just my random thought. Weell, not problem at all!<br />
<br />
As you can see, to the story progression by the end of the season 1. Empire Nation war finally escalated to the never ending World War, which will lead to the WW II events at the future. This got foreshadowed again by the post-credit scenes, with so much new technologies and army for incoming war. But, with the year stated in the information, i doubt it. Still, my prediction over this outcome war so far really bring to those events. And with the future happen at the first scene, i got a pessimistic way to the glory of the Empire Nation.<br />
<br />
By the future foreshadowed event of unclear in the first minutes, all got their answer. The war, the empire, the little devil, what is the result? With the scene refer at the Union basis nation, which i may guess at the AK or in english Allied Kingdom, i shall say, the Empire at last momment lost their victory. Lost their history by being a single ruler toward the world. And, to another big questions, what happen to Tanya? Well, my answer shall be get on the LN, and hope the answer do not dissapointed me. Lol!<br />
<br />
Ok, enough for my summaries. I must say one or two other detailed paragraph toward some review sections. But, my review here shall be the shortest review i may had for the past anime show. Yes, no other score i shall give to this great show rather than my full 10 scores to the whole sections!<br />
<br />
I may give 9 to the art, but, i really enjoyed the development on war graphic Nut has gived to me. The studio really put much effort now, which is realistic since this was the movies. Shall make a good art for the good sales, right? Btw, Look, how amazing the magic art was! Look, how intimidate image art giving to the Tanya. Look, how good and give so much detail depiction toward Tanyas desperation (at the duel battle to the new Bakemono girls)! Love all of them, i really enjoy every seconds i got to the show!<br />
<br />
All same to the music, sound, character. With the story shall be my favourite which is make me not put this less than 10. Yeah, the music and sound keep the same pace. Irritating as always. Thrilling as expected. Tensing up so much as predicted. No more bad reason. Amazing show shall give an amazing score points too!<br />
<br />
Same to the character section. As remember from the start. Yet, we can see other development contribution, with nice conversation and story progression toward this development. My beloved assistant Mayor (i cant quite fit to say her name, so i shall say her Sere-chan!), shall be another shine star in this show.<br />
<br />
Yes, it shall be the third star. While another Bakemono, looks like a rival girl to Tanya. Her name was Mary, and she simply be my second charas for the most developed in this whole series. I may skip a bit about Mary, yet, her skill and magic shall be the problem at the future. But, what she can do to fight the devil itself? It somehow shall need more help for the God to show some mere fight. Gah, enough about that at next series. I can&#039;t focus for the next events.<br />
<br />
So, my point here, i must focus to the Sere-chan. What can she do? She was a master at poker! Yet, she sure has so much lucky side, an fortune one to the whole crews, even to Tanya itself! Yes, that was my well decision to give the characterization section to the full of 10. Love thats change of characterization development. From being a lifeless boring sided character, which is show at the begin, i think she shall die in the first sign. But, at the end she was the real hero to Tanya&#039;s progression. The real deal for Being X purposes. Now i know the real reason why Tanya always still alive at the middle of the deadly situation at the whole deadly massive never ending war. Sere-chan was there for save some butt. And ofc, other batallion member crews Tanya command had enough development and screen time. All of them was good, impresive teach, once again, to my beloved little bitchy devil, Mayor Tanya (forget, i know her rank now is Lieutenant Colonel. But still, i like the Mayor one!).<br />
<br />
With thats being said, overall, no need for another drama. The drama about art of war shall be too good to be true. My recommendation still same from the start. With another great enhancement to the art points. My judge shall be no clue, but, for the Saga of Tanya the Evil, all just solid.<br />
<br />
10/10. Hope the LN shall come to the conclusion no more a decade to see where this shit show end, where my devil Tanya deserve her cursed fate. Finger crossed!

    After watching the movie, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you liked Season 1, hope you&#039;re ready for some new content in &quot;Loli Hitler VS The Commies.&quot;<br />
<br />
The movie gives more development to Tanya and tackles the next page in Tanya&#039;s story, as well as giving us new insight into the character properly introduced at the end of Season 1: Mary Sue, daughter of Anson Sioux. The illusion that there is always a &quot;right&quot; side is easily destroyed once again. War is complex, and this movie exemplifies it. Not to mention the irony of going to war in order to attain peace.<br />
<br />
Studio NUT

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308583">
        makes great use of the movie budget, and the resulting aerial battles look amazing. The fights are crisp, clean, and full of action, while the shot composition during lengthy conversations is great as always. Due to the scale of the battles, however, there are some CG crowds. But, they&#039;re just a few one-off scenes, so there aren&#039;t too many of them.<br />
<br />
The musical score for this movie is also great! The violins, trumpets, and choir of Tanya von Degurechaff&#039;s bombastic theme make a return. Though the OST of the movie is similar to the OST of Season 1, the themes and motifs easily proved themselves in this movie. The familiar ED &quot;Los! Los! Los!&quot; also makes a return, and with the gunshot, sounds of warfare, and new art, it doesn&#039;t lose its luster.<br />
<br />
Also, MYTH &amp; ROID does not disappoint with their song &quot;Remembrance.&quot; Definitely, a more somber piece that fits the loss and agony of war.<br />
<br />
Overall, this movie is more of the Youjo Senki that we know and love, and definitely worth the watch.

    This review will include **SPOILERS**<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
I have already read up on the light novels and they adapted this very well into the movie. They did do a very good in managing the chapters and time. Though this did leave out some details that made the light novel enjoyable, but I understand they had to do it to not make it too boring. The only thing I do regret about it was that they left out the African Campaign, I guess they wanted to get straight into the fight with Mary Sue.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The art is pretty ok, but there are some points where the CG gets

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318921">
        whacky. But overall it is decent and doesn&#039;t really bother me.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10 <br />
I&#039;m pretty sure this has been overstated to death ,but the sounds in this series is seriously amazing. Nothing to say much about it.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
Characters were the same from the original series. Interesting as usual but this movie gives less insight on the character but more on the feud between Mary and Tanya.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
Overall, I&#039;m just glad we had more Youjo Senki. I am personally satisfied as I got to understand more about what happened since the novel lacked some maps. <br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
<br />

    I can still feel the dread curling in my stomach as I watched each and every moment of this wonderful movie. As an avid action fan, I couldn&#039;t help but be thrilled at Degurechaff&#039;s victories and dread her losses/missed opportunities. The story jumps right in without any recap, so it&#039;s best to watch the previous series, but let&#039;s be honest if you&#039;re here for this movie specifically you would&#039;ve watched the series. The music and art are spectacular as always with the sounds always amped up for dramatic effect or quieted down to amplify the sense of death/not blow your ears out which I appreciate(a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317058">
        lot). As someone who knows these characters I&#039;m fine, but outside of those who know it&#039;s hard to get a sense of who each person is and what there purpose/ reason to act the way they do, again this is probably intentional as to redirect to the  main series. Nevertheless, the actions scenes are phenomenal and while the gore is only slight it does reach the intended course to make the audience understand that while the story  is thrilling, it is by no means an advocate for war. I enjoy how that while only elaborated slightly, the various number of characters have different ideals and objectives each portrayed with various degrees of success. At times I wanted to yell at certain characters and other times cheer for them, the fact the movie made me feel that , overall makes it a damn good movie. I can&#039;t deny part of my enjoyment comes from the sheer thrill I get from watch Degurechaff&#039;s face morph in  utter delight or despair as she faces being x. I hate being x as a character but love him as a villain, his existence makes me sympathize with Degurechaff so easily and his role lights the story in a new perspective. I feel like I&#039;m rambling, so I&#039;ll just conclude by saying this is a damn good movie that you have to watch preferably with popcorn and soda , so you can spew at the person next to you when you feel really happy or pumped up or pissed(JK :) Don&#039;t really do that unless you know them real well and won&#039;t get sued or anything:))

    The only think I didn&#039;t like about this was that the CGI was at some points bad, but that&#039;s a common problem within most anime... just look at Dragon Ball Super: Broly.<br />
<br />
This was everything and more that I was expecting. The sound design was phenomenal... NO everything was phenomenal. As stated the CG was at some points bad, but not distractingly so. Story wasn&#039;t too complex, but it didn&#039;t need to be. <br />
<br />
In the movie the characters from the series stayed as great as they were and even the newer characters worked great in the story and Mary Sioux&#039;s character development and change from a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316928">
        calm and collected character to the dark side was beautiful. <br />
<br />
The only downside to this is that I can only give it 10/10 where as this deserves at least 11/10.

    “SPOILERS FOR YOUJO SENKI SEASON 1” <br />
<br />
Well better late than never eh? <br />
<br />
Youjo Senki was one of the most entertaining anime from 2017 and gave birth to anime’s most vicious loli, Tanya von Degurechaff. The series has been, without a doubt, one of my favourite Isekai series but the show was left on a cliffhanger that left to the possibility of a season two. What we go was not season two but a sequel movie which followed up after season one. A bit annoying but hey, we are getting more Tanya so who am I to complain. Now that I have finally got around to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316722">
        watch it, what did I think? Well I’ll tell you. Bear in mind though, I’ve never done a review for an anime movie but talking about this series will not be a problem so lets get to it. <br />
<br />
Sit back relax and salute your ass off as I present to you the sequel movie to Youjo Senki. Or by its English name, Saga of Tanya the Evil. Lets begin. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
<br />
Following after season one, Tanya and the rest of the 203rd airborne company have just finished quelling a rebel force. As soon as she returns from the mission, she and her company are immediately sent north to keep an eye on The Federation. But after The Federation open fired, they attack. The war between The Imperium and the Federation has begun and Tanya must now take her forces and push pack The Federation. Meanwhile on the Federation side, a new mage recruit by the name of Mary Sioux has joined the forces after being blessed by God (or Being X) and is seeking revenge for the death of her father by the hands of Tanya. <br />
<br />
It’s pretty much is more of the story that we got to see in season one but with some added elements that will cause Tanya more trouble. Although that is definitely not a bad thing. Being X is still toying with Tanya by facing another mage blessed by god and not giving her a break whatsoever. This is especially true when it comes to the final act but we will get to that. The first act pretty much sets the stage for the movie to follow. The Federation attacks, The Imperium fights back. It helps us realise that Tanya’s fighting isn’t done yet and might not be for some time. The second act helps set the scene between the eventual fight between Tanya and Mary and to help further ignite the fuel for war. I might sound like I&#039;m skimming over this but really, there is nothing much new in terms of what we already have seen from season one. Like I said, definitely not a bad thing. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Although I will say that I’m surprised that Being X doesn’t have much direct involvement in this movie. Being X mainly works behind the shadows as usual but I feel like Being X could have been more direct towards Tanya, especially after Tanya encounters Mary. Being X could have toyed with Tanya but nope nothing happens. <br />
<br />
The final act is where things start to get interesting as we see this movie go all out with the fighting and we see how Tanya and the rest of the 203rd airborne company copes with such an overwhelming force. It gives this thought in your head that maybe this would be too much for Tanya and the 203rd airborne company. It makes for a nice change of pace considering that Tanya has been squashing everyone she has been fighting. Having an overwhelming enemy at your doors and fighting a mage that is on equal footing with Tanya makes for some of the most tense moments in the movie and kept me hooked to my seat as I kept watching. It was something that this movie needed. Something to make my eyes glue to the screen as I kept watching and it did that. <br />
<br />
Characters: 7/10<br />
<br />
Tanya is still Tanya in this movie and nothing much has changed about her other than some revelations in the movie that she has experienced that I won’t say specifically due to spoilers. The revelations though do help give some more light of what Tanya thinks about fighting in wars and why she wants to stay behind the front lines. Her experience in this movie gives her some justification and to make sure she continues to defy Being X (as futile as it may be). Being pushed to her limits was also refreshing as we know now going forward that she isn’t straight up overpowered and there are people who can match her in a firefight; which did lead to some intense moments in the movie. <br />
<br />
The other character the movie focused on was Mary Sioux and I just couldn’t get into her. She is a rather one dimensional character with her sole trait being that she is obsessed with avenging her father’s death. That’s pretty much it. It helps give perspective of how Tanya’s killing spree is affecting other people’s lives but honestly, she is just there so that Being X can push Tanya to her breaking point. So that’s all she is really, a vessel for Being X to toy Tanya with. <br />
<br />
<br />
Animation: 8/10<br />
<br />
Studio Nut continues where it left off from season one. I have to say, it does look like more stuff is happening on screen which helps increase the scale of the battles. For an episodic series, the animation would look really good. For a movie though, it looked a bit stiff at times. Some of the scenes in the film where Nut could have flexed their muscles looked a bit janky at times and was moving a frame by frame pace that was quite noticeable. Though the magical bullets and explosions still look cool and there were some really good shots so so it till can look really good, I just think it could have looked better in some scenes of the movie. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
Nothing really to complain here. The sound department was one of Youjo Senki’s strongest points and it continues here. The bullet sound effects, the explosions and other noticeable factors in the sound department made it felt like everything had a noticeable impact to it. Same goes with the soundtrack as it still has that bombastic choir and instrumentals to it that made it rather epic to listen to and to get you hyped. While I didn’t notice any new tracks, the soundtrack was really good overall that it didn’t really matter. <br />
<br />
The only real new notable song coming from this movie was &quot;Remembrance&quot; by MYTH &amp; ROID and act as a nice calm down down for the credit sequence while still having that MYTH &amp; ROID style that makes them recognisable. Seriously, what a year MYTH &amp; ROID are having at the moment. This, “Shadowgraph” from Boogiepop and Others and while I was harsh on Isekai Cheat Magician’s opening, the song itself “PANTA RHEI” is still really good. With them doing the opening for one more anime this year, I&#039;m looking forward to it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion: <br />
<br />
As a follow up to Youjo senki, the movie, I would say, does its job well as being a good follow up. Tanya is still a great antagonist and this movie doesn’t change that. The ost and sound effects still kick ass and the animation, while stumbling in some areas, still looks good. My main gripe with the movie was Mary herself and I feel like the movie didn’t do a good job of fleshing her out. Of course, there maybe another chance because the movie was left on ANOTHER cliffhanger that makes me question whether we are going to get more. With season one, I felt that the 12 episodes we got were good enough for it to be its own story. But with the way the movie went, it now feels kind of unfinished and stuck in a limbo until we get an announcement of a follow up. If we do, then these last couple of sentences don’t matter. If we don’t, well then we are out of luck and must seek the original material. <br />
<br />
Still, if you want more Youjo Senki, this film will certainly fill that need as it is a good follow up and I salute Tanya for it. <br />
<br />
<br />
My Personal enjoyment: 9/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall score: 8.4/10 Recommendation: Watch it<br />

    Everything you loved about Youjo Senki, but this time our lovely Tanya is killing commies on the Eastern Front (because hey, God decided that bringing the communists into the war furthers his goals...)<br />
- Art is amazing, as usual. Mature &amp; realistic, and exaggerated when it comes to highlighting the strong emotions of Tanya.<br />
- The battle sounds deserve the best headphones. You feel the sound of crunching metal as both personnel and equipment are blown to smithereens by the Mage battalion. . <br />
- Tanya Degurechaff is as kawaii as always, and feels strong about defeating the marauding commies to protect her peace as a capitalist salaryman.<br />
-

          <span style="display: none;" id="review380240">
        Well written dialogue of how you would expect grown men &amp; officers to speak.<br />
- Interesting strategic &amp; tactical view of what is fantasy version of both WW1 &amp; WW2.<br />
- Lots of explosions and war crimes.<br />
- A+ 10/10 anime.

    Youjo Senki Movie – (anime movie)<br />
Out of 100 Nobles watching...<br />
68 were impressed!<br />
32 died in the trenches of modern animated movie development<br />
<br />
I really struggled with how to score the Youjo Senki Movie. Youjo Senki is one of the finest and most unique Isekai in the genre, but that makes a disappointing adaptation all the more painful. It’s really hard to pinpoint exactly where everything didn’t hit for me, and I feel bad saying it’s mostly in the animation but that’s really most of it. It’s safe to say that if you like Youjo Senki and don’t have a discerning eye then you will probably get a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365721">
        lot more out of this film than I did. <br />
<br />
The greatest strength of the original series was by far the sound design, and that holds true here. Meaty thwacks, cracking bones, gunfire, and explosions are all excellently rendered. I highly recommend watching the original anime and this movie with a nice surround sound system for so audio porn.<br />
<br />
The movie continues to execute the premise of the series very well. I remember when the anime aired my initial impressions were that this series was going to be edgy tragedy porn like modern magical girl anime, but to my surprise the series takes its isekai startup and elevates it to a much more standard military anime. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the story of the movie felt pretty weak. Picking up where the first season left off the movie dives into the Mary Sue arc where god has ordained another with their divinity to further test Tanya. I have yet to watch it but I believe the Kimetsu no Yaiba movie did this same approach. Following up a season with a film of the next arc is a pretty clever way to keep the ball rolling on the story while getting funding for that second course. Demon Slayer just judging by the trailer seems actually cover the entire arc in its movie where the Youjo Senki Movie does not. The film ends very lukewarm and while I don’t have much to complain about in the way of the actual structure of the movie an ending with no actual conflict resolution feels pretty lame. <br />
<br />
Studio Nut is a relative newcomer, but they should definitely be disappointed in themselves. Another title has now entered in the list of “movies that look worse than their neighboring material”. The Youjo Senki anime had some abysmal animation I won’t deny that. Stiff 3d model soldiers falling over like chess pieces with stock looking explosion animations in the foreground is something I won’t defend. What the original anime did right, however is that it went all out where it counted. The conflicts and dogfights between mages were what was important in the series and the anime season clearly spent most of its budget on those scenes as well as the expressive unique facial animation of the main characters. The movie on the other hand constantly berates you with 2d over 3d assets that really is distracting. It may seem like a little thing, but when you can clearly see that the urban background characters are flying by are cheap 3d models you can be pulled out of a scene. Instead of thinking “this is hype!” what comes to mind is “this looks really bad” and you never want that to be in your viewers minds during a climactic battle scene. <br />
<br />
I like Youjo Senki. I like it a lot. I would even say I generally enjoyed this movie. I was just fairly disappointed with the amount of story that was covered with this film as well as the lackluster animation. Studio ufotable tricked everyone with Kimestu no Yaiba’s animation by really putting their all into most of the important scene’s that viewers would remember, relying on those moments to carry the lackluster animation found in the rest of the show. Studio Nut failed to do this and instead produced something I would compare to the “Dragon Ball Super Movie: Broly” that had awful 1st person perspective with bad looking CG lava in its main feature.  If a studio doesn’t have the resources to produce something visually impressive or at the very least cannot present what’s important as best they can then I would rather have a work never be adapted to film, and that’s a terrible feeling to have about a property you love. <br />

    Youjo Senki Movie picks off right where the anime series left off, and it&#039;s every bit as good, and in many ways even better than before.<br />
<br />
If you haven&#039;t watched the anime, go do so now. I won&#039;t repeat my review in depth, but let&#039;s just say that production values have been cranked up even further, the solid story and characters remain, leading to an amazing visual and storytelling spectacle. <br />
<br />
If military and magic anime is your thing, you MUST give this a watch.<br />
<br />
Like seriously, it&#039;s good. Story is a direct continuation from the anime, the art and sound are absolutely mindblowing yet again, and the

Anime Review: The Saga of Tanya the Evil<br />
<br />
This is one of the shows that I did not expect to like at first, especially I&#039;m not into military, history, and political stuff, and their terms used is a little bit foreign to me. I wasn&#039;t very hooked at the beginning and that&#039;s probably because of my interest. But when I continued watching, it&#039;s getting way better than what I expected. I love the personality of Tanya and how it was low key developed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339260">
        throughout the season and the movie. At first, she wouldn&#039;t even care about life and death itself (except hers). But when the story progresses (especially in the movie), she became a considerate leader. However, she still prioritizes her freedom and well-being and she&#039;s looking for a way to get out of the bloody situation, which is true to human nature. For me, the first season is like a long introduction and its last episode is truly the beginning. The movie is a masterpiece! It is very well-directed and the phasing is perfect. I love the symbolism they&#039;ve used like the cliffhanger ending where the cards were shown and it actually means a lot depending on the viewers&#039; interpretation. The action and animation is splendid. There are a lot of things happening in one frame that is perfectly portraying the intensity of war. Props to the voice actors, they gave more life and emotions to these characters. Lastly, the lesson to ponder in this story is deep and it significantly show how complex our emotions are. Emotions can lead us to any possible actions, no matter how good or bad the decision is. I guess when you think of the word &quot;monstrous&quot;, it&#039;s the humanity itself, and we&#039;re not even guilty of it.
