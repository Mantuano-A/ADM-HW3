    The strength of Whisper of the Heart is the strength all films that have been touched by Miyazaki seem to have. That is, the details. In this film the things that have impressed me were the little extras that are contained in each characters movements. It&#039;s something that you very rarely get—at least this consistently—outside of Miyazaki films. Whether it be reaching for the lamp cord from bed, failing, and needing to sit up to do it properly, or whether it be the normal silences in conversation (as apposed to dramatic silences), everything just feels a lot more real, a lot more vibrant than most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34731">
        films.<br />
<br />
Regarding this film in comparison to other films Miyazaki has been a part of, this one seems to by far have the fewest fantastic elements (that is, elements which contain impossible occurrences or imaginary creatures). If I could compare it to any other Miyazaki film, I would say that it is most like My Neighbor Totoro, in that they both focus on the more or less ordinary lives of their characters, rather than large, sweeping plots. It is something that needs to be watched with a mind set that is not waiting for something to move forward, or endanger the characters lives, or otherwise throw them into an absurd situation. Everything that happens in the plot is very believable, yet has its own magic about it because of the playful way it is presented.<br />
<br />
One thing that was especially impressive about this film, although most Miyazaki films carry this trait, was the accuracy of the child psychology (and psychology in general). When you watch the characters of this film interact with each other, and when you see things happen to them and how it affects them, you get a feeling of profound truth. This film is dramatic, but it was not cinema dramatic, it was true dramatic. If a character is sad, that doesn&#039;t become their entire personality, it is something that affects their personality. The reason I ramble so long about this is because of how rare it is to see in any medium of art. It is something that if you are looking for it, it is truly beautiful and astounding. This quality of work is not easily imitated.<br />
<br />
If you ask me why I rate the art a &quot;9&quot; I will tell it is because of its expressiveness. The landscapes are beautiful, sure, but the real reason I give it a 9 is because of the work put into the animations of every character. There is nothing lazy about it, and there is a uniqueness to the characters movements that takes serious attention. Most films will cut corners in this department, but even though you could call this movie&#039;s art dated, that doesn&#039;t decrease the pleasure gained from its attentiveness.<br />
<br />
Still, I will hesitate to recommend this to everyone. If you want a plot that &#039;actually goes somewhere,&#039; so to speak, this film will not give that to you. If you want a film with a tonne of weird and unbelievable things (such as you may be used to with Miyazaki), this film will also not deliver that. What this film delivers is a very detailed picture of its characters which is at times heart warming, at other times heart breaking, and at all times true.<br />
<br />
Loved it.

    Whisper of the Heart is unique with respect to its Ghibli film counterparts in that it seems almost mundane. Here we have our main heroine Shizuku Tsukishima and her life as a middle school-aged girl. While the film is essentially a slice-of-life with a hint of the &quot;boy-meets-girl&quot; rom-com trope thrown in, the way in which its characters are presented is not only relate-able to the audience but also endearing; an adult could sympathize with Shizuku just as much as a child could. As someone who values character development greatly, I feel that the creators efforts really pay off in showing how our main heroine

          <span style="display: none;" id="review110795">
        develops over a short period of time, providing insight into her stream of consciousness with her full range of emotions on display. Combined with a diverse ensemble of a supporting cast, Shizuku&#039;s character really comes to life over the course of the film. <br />
<br />
True to form as a Ghibli production, this film complements its character driven narrative with a slew of wall-paper worthy long shots and vibrant animation schemes which I have yet to see that often even in more recent large scale production anime ( there are several such scenes in the latter half of the film, but no spoilers here of course!). Not much else to say here, I recommend you watch the film and see for yourself.<br />
<br />
Sound quality in the film was solid throughout. But what really won me over was the Japanese rendition of Jon Denver&#039;s country road. Not only was it an impressive rendition by itself, it was incredibly appropriate for the small town slice-of-life feel that the creators seemed to be going for. Even after hearing it on replay throughout the film, I did not tire of that song, which in my opinion, speaks volumes for how fitting the song was for the film&#039;s overall atmosphere. Sadly, the other background music did go relatively unnoticed, but upon re-watching the movie and listening to the original soundtrack again, the rest of the background music was quite good as well.<br />
<br />
When we think of studio Ghbli we often times think of Hayao Miyazaki and sometimes Isao Takahata. In the case of Whisper of the heart, we have a tale with all the flavor and style reminiscent of these Ghibli greats, and yet was directed by neither Miyazaki nor Takahata but instead by a man named Yoshifumi Kondō, whose life was cut tragically short after the release of his 1st and only film. A darn shame too, because at the time he was considered a legitimate candidate to succeed Miyazaki as head of the studio. <br />
<br />
As a film that seems almost forgotten among the plethora of excellent productions from studio Ghibli, Whisper of the Heart is a much watch as an entry level anime for people just getting into the medium and as a deeper exploration into the world of anime film for seasoned veterans out there. In addition, as with all Ghibli films, Whisper of the Heart feels like it was made with a general audience in mind, so you needn&#039;t be a fan of slice-of-life to enjoy watching it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Even if you end up not liking this film I hope you found my review helpful. Of course I am always looking to improve, so feedback is always appreciated.<br />
Just leave a message on my profile thread if you have any comments, criticisms, or just wanna talk about anime!! <br />

    Adolescence is among the most memorable phases in one&#039;s life. During this time, we tend to make decisions based on adrenaline instincts, work as we wish to, while repudiating any advice. Some of us even develop endearing feelings of love for someone, while also chasing our own dream or even remoulding them for the sake of someone else, often out of inspiration and seldom out of desperation.<br />
<br />
Working on the themes of adolescence and infatuation giving rise to a wonderful journey of self discovery, Studio Ghibli presents us with Mimi wo Sumaseba also commonly known as Whisper of the Heart. The story mainly revolves around the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review130577">
        female lead, Shizuku Tsukishima, a junior high school girl living in New Tama Town. The story progresses as Shizuku constantly finds a certain someone, named Seiji Awasama, always issuing books before she does at her town library, which leads her to grow a sense of respect while her imagination weaves together a personality of Seiji as one could only describe as the &quot;Prince Charming of her life.&quot; Much to her disappointment, Seiji is any thing but the &quot;prince charming&quot; she had imagined him to be; but Seiji had a unique charm of his own. One thing led to another and soon, Shizuku starts facing typical teenage life problem ranging from the urge to rebel against her parent&#039;s wishes, unnecessarily squabbling with her siblings, while also realising she has fallen in love with the &quot;not-the-prince-charming-she-had-imagined&quot;, Seiji. Hereby follows a movie about self discovery, presented in the most heartwarming way possible.<br />
<br />
Now it may seem like any other teenage-romance on pen and paper, but Whisper of the Heart, has its own charm, specially due to the way it presents itself. The problem with most romance shows now a days is that they tend to be extremely dull or overly melodramatic and their predictable plot structure doesn’t help them much either. While being melodramatic, most also tend to be highly unrealistic with their character interactions, their behaviour, body language and much more which just brings their over all quality down. Whisper of the heart, throws all these out of the window and carves its path through this genre in a rather realistic and dramatic way, without crossing the dreaded line between the dramatic and the melodramatic. Character interactions are seamless and seem as realistic as it can get for a story of such sorts. Characters behave as a mere reflection of any other ordinary teenager, as they would to the shown circumstances and these strokes of realism are even more integrated into the movie with the help of detailed, subtle body language of the the characters through which many emotions are shown, rather than told through mere dialogue exchange.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves are rather eccentric even though they are fairly ordinary people. The female lead, Shizuka, is a rather charming and adorable girl. Her relation with her family and her friends is well portrayed through meaningful dialogue. Her monologues of what she thinks about her sister, mother, her best friends and her general view of the situations she faces helps build up her base character along with her relationship with the side characters in a gradual and methodical way. The development that Shizuka goes through the movie, simply put, is phenomenal. From a naive junior high student, who didn’t know what she wanted to do with her talent, and on the bigger scale, with her life; Shizuka realises her field of interest and recognises her talents. Her love for writing also explores her vivid and colourful imagination. She comes to realise the importance of family and meeting up with family expectations, while chasing her individual dream too, but the main motivation behind most of her development is her love interest, Seiji.<br />
<br />
Seiji is quite the character himself. He is shown as an ordinary boy, working at his grandfather’s small antique shop, while learning both, to build and play the violin. The development between Seiji and Shizuko’s romantic relationship, albeit a bit cheesy, was handled with great care. While Seiji doesn’t receive as much development as Shizuko on screen, most of his character development is rather implied. While maintaining Seiji’s lively manner, we see a sense of responsibility grow in him which we naturally see in most teens as they go through their phase of adolescence. His growth in sense of responsibility is established through his interactions with Shizuko, specially, the conversation they have on the school rooftop where they realise they have to work their way so that they could live and spend more time together in the future.All these character interactions which lead to their subtle development, was neatly woven together by the skilful hands of the director, Yoshifumi Kondou, who is known for his works in various other critically acclaimed works such as Omoide Poroporo and Akage no Anne as an animation director.<br />
<br />
Studio Ghibli has always been known for sending the audience into another magical dimension with their various works, but sometimes, due to the lack of proper direction, the whole magical element backfires, and in the end, the movie tends to become a mess. Thankfully, Whisper of the Heart, is not one of these movies! Even though the movie is highly realistic at its core, Studio Ghibli didn’t stop from adding their key fantasy elements into the movie. And with the efficient direction, these were used to enhance the whole experience of the viewer. Shizuka’s main writing work is dynamically shown, rather than being simply narrated. These scenes range from talking rabbits wearing monocles to riding an air stream to an unknown mysterious castle. All these fantasy elements are integrated into the movie with great caress without leaving deep scars on the strokes of realism, the movie portrays.<br />
<br />
The animation delivered by Studio Ghibli, as usual, is fantastic. Great detail is maintained in almost every frame and the movement of characters and the general motion is as fluid as it can get. The landscape scenes are pretty eye candy and the movie is completely devoid of any ugly CGI. There are some great camera angles used when necessary, sometime to show the overarching city while some soothing music plays to evoke a strange feeling of nostalgia. The artistic direction of the movie takes credits when the fantasy world is involved, as the colour palette becomes much more vibrant and animation becomes subtly smoother and camera angles range from the typical to experimental ones where Shizuka is shown riding the winds to the castle.<br />
<br />
Along with the magical animation, the movie imbues a deep sense of nostalgia with its musical direction. The movie begins with Olivia Newton John’s cover of the famous song, Country Road, which itself evokes a warm fuzzy feeling in the viewer, making them feel right at home. Other than that particular cover of John Dever’s, country road, a japanese rendition is sung many times in the movie and their placement couldn’t have been more correct which added to the overall atmosphere of the film, whenever they were used. A personal favourite would be when Seiji plays the violin and Shizuka sings along and the elders join in with various other instruments, to create one of the most joyous and heart warming scenes in anime for me personally, but one could feel free to disagree, I guess. Other soundtracks just add to the magic of the film and its overarching, heartwarming atmosphere. To weave such a fantastic atmosphere, and evoke feelings of nostalgia with the music alone, credits must be given to the “music director”, Yuuiji Nomi who is also known for his quirky OST’s in Nichijou.<br />
<br />
With all that said and done, I must conclude by saying that Whisper of the Heart is a wonderful coming of age film; and a journey of self discovery. This film has something for everybody to enjoy, whether it be seeing yourself as a teenager grow up in the movie, facing similar problems or for parents, who could see how to co-operate with their child when they’re in their rebellious phase of life and let them freely chase their dreams. The fantastic musical score coupled with the fluid animation has the right balance of drama imbibed into it. It may appear to some as a typical animated work at first glance but once the experience is over, many will quickly realise that Whisper of the Heart is anything but typical. <br />
<br />
And yeah, Country Roads, will never be the same again, for me at least.

    Story:<br />
The story is based on a manga by Aoi Hiiragi. What I like about it is that it focuses on a problem that each of us go to at a certain point in our lives, what we want to be when we grow up. This is usually affected by our own capabilities, dreams, certain circumstances and people around us that either pull us down or help us keep going. I think students can relate to the plot better since they are going through similar to what the characters in the story are.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The characters are drawn in the usual Ghibli style. Although simple, the characters are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1903">
        able to portray the emotions needed to make the story believable. The background is very well designed and the little details like thrash on the street, pipes  from the houses are all there. They make the environment the character moves in more real. I like these aspects bests in the movie.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The music fits the story well, you can get the feel of the story right away and the translation of Country Roads is very amusing. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
The main character responds to her problems immaturely at first but we can see her become more responsible as the story progresses. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
It&#039;s very inspiring once you relate yourself to the plot. It combines a little humor, determination, anger and a little bit of puppy love. A movie you can watch over and over again and pick up ideas from.

    I&#039;ve reviewed a lot of Studio Ghibli films. In January of 2014, one of those films was The Cat Returns. During that review, I mentioned that it&#039;s a spin-off loosely connected to this film, Whisper of the Heart. Now, that film was pretty good with plenty of strong elements. Let&#039;s look at Whisper of the Heart and see if the same holds true for it.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Shizuku has a pretty easy life. Her parents are easy-going and she has plenty of friends and lots of time to read obsessively. One day, she notices that all of the books she gets from the library seem to have been

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208994">
        checked out by the same guy before her. She&#039;s curious about what he could be like and, by sheer coincidence, meets a guy she doesn&#039;t know. I&#039;m sure these two plot points are completely unrelated. The film follows Shizuku in her daily life with the focus on two major facets, her budding romantic interest in the boy she barely knows and her coming of age and learning what she wants to do and trying her hardest to follow it.<br />
<br />
The biggest flaw with the film is the romance aspect. Our two leads are still in their pubescent stage and, frankly, they have about as much chemistry as Argon has with anything. Yet the narrative treats their barely started relationship as important and serious. I give them a couple months together at most before they break up. The coming of age element, however, is pretty well done and it elegantly illustrates what it&#039;s like for someone to discover their passion and immerse herself in it. Aside from those two elements, the film is pretty tedious with very little of interest happening. Honestly, it can be really mind-numbing to slog through.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The characters in the film vary. Some of them are quite dull, having only a really basic purpose to fill before being banished to wherever trite characters go when they&#039;ve done their bit. Shizuku is a pretty fleshed out and developed character. I will say, most of the characters have enough to them to have verisimilitude, even if they don&#039;t ultimately contribute to the narrative all that much.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The artwork and animation are the best aspects of the film. Both are really well done in classic Ghibli fashion. So, if nothing else it is a very pretty, nicely detailed film.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The vocal cast and music are both pretty middling. They&#039;re passable, but not good. The stand out performance has to be from Honna Youko, who is coincidentally going to be featured in next week&#039;s series too. She does do a really good job, but you also have actors like Tachibana Takashi who just sound bored. The music is fine, unless you really love or hate the song Country Road. Which does get a bit over-used and could start to wear on your nerves, especially if you aren&#039;t kindly disposed towards it to begin with.<br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
There really isn&#039;t any in this film.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
Whisper of the Heart is not a good film. It isn&#039;t bad either. It&#039;s just a film with a dull narrative, bland characters and excellent artwork. If you really like slow slice of life works, you might enjoy it. Otherwise, I can&#039;t really recommend it. Especially when Studio Ghibli has so many really strong films that are filled with intrigue and adventure. My final rating is going to be a 5/10. So, this month we&#039;ve looked at Nuku Nuku Dash in honour of Hyashibara Megumi month, Yuru Yuri San Hai in honour of yuri month and now this in honour of Ghibli month. Next week we harken back to last year&#039;s magical girl month with a look at Futari wa Precure: Max Heart.

    I saw this yesterday and literally felt hapiness during this movie. It may not have spirits and magic (like another movies from Studio Ghibli), but this movie shines because it&#039;s realistic. What a shame this movie isn&#039;t popular in general.<br />
<br />
History/Character (10/10): The story starts simple with a girl who isn&#039;t much interested in anything other than reading books, and is still half lost with what she&#039;s going to do with her life, doubting from the opinions of others whether or not she&#039;s good for a creative work of being a writer. She never fell in love or showed to be passionate about anything specific, until

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405834">
        in an apparently neutral life, a different event happens in the girl&#039;s routine: she realizes that from the books she reads someone has the same interest as her in the same books. So, with the &quot;chance&quot; of life, from another event that she shows interest in, she follows an interesting cat to another part of town, where there, she discovers more and more reasons to fall in love with life. <br />
<br />
One of Studio Ghibli&#039;s best-constructed stories, with simplicity and delicacy at the same time, about the change in perspective that can change someone&#039;s life from beautiful situations in life. The film shows that you don&#039;t have to go far to realize that love may be closer than you think. The novel isn&#039;t the main thing the author wants you to pay attention to, but it&#039;s one of the ingredients that add beauty to the main character&#039;s construction. Giving her the courage to follow her dreams and not care what others think of her life. Bringing together art and music, in one of the most beautiful films in simplicity about how to see life.<br />
<br />
Art/Sound (10/10): Almost every Studio Ghibli movie has an almost impeccable soundtrack in the background, with the delicacy of Hisaishi Joe, all were well constructed instrumentally. &quot;Take me Home, Country Roads&quot; was placed as a cover of the main characters through the violin and singing, and in a spectacular way, respecting the dynamics of the film and bringing more passion to the scene together with the whole transition context of the character&#039;s life main in history. Art is not left behind, even in simple everyday situations, like taking a train and in dream situations with magic and fun, they are very lively and fluid, being an important part of contributing to the growth of the entertainment of any one who is watching the movie.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of my movies have strong female protagonists - brave self-sufficient girls who don&#039;t think twice about fighting for what they believe with all their hearts. They&#039;ll need a friend or someone to support them, but never a savior.&quot; Miyazaki, Hayao<br />
<br />
My experience with the film was gratifying, when I stopped to see it, I didn&#039;t expect it to be all that I saw. Quite the contrary, at first I thought it would be a slower movie compared to newer Studio movies. But it was a totally positive surprise that I would recommend for anyone to watch and feel their heart warm at the end of a day. Kisses from Brazil.

    It&#039;s no secret that Ghibli films often invoke that wondrous sense of childhood nostalgia that can&#039;t be replaced by anyone. From the gorgeous backgrounds to the expressive animation, to the incredible fantasy worlds or the down to earth slice of life stories they tell, it&#039;s hardly a surprise that they are still a beloved animation studio after all these years. However, this film takes a different approach. This film explores that kind of childhood wonder that so many of these other Ghibli films give by focusing on the perspective of a young girl who feels like she isn&#039;t doing enough. A girl who has a

        deeply relatable inferiority complex wants to be an author and desires to feel like she&#039;s good enough to both herself and for the boy she likes. This is the tale of Shizuku Tsukishima, a girl who&#039;s struggling to grow up.<br />
<br />
Shizuku Tsukishima is a middle school student who loves reading fantasy books and getting lost in the stories that she reads. She often doesn&#039;t focus on what she&#039;s supposed to do because she&#039;s so wrapped up in her fantasies. She&#039;s known to often frequent the library and her older sister worries that she isn&#039;t focusing on her schoolwork because of her antics. What&#039;s interesting about Shizuku is that she starts as this cheerful but hot headed kid who butts heads with a boy her age who also reads fantasy novels named Seiji Amasawa and gets herself into awkward situations with other people, to a young girl who&#039;s revealed to has self-esteem issues and after seeing how incredibly talented Seiji as a violin carpenter. She feels like she is aimless with her life and she isn&#039;t doing enough with her life. As a middle schooler and still going through adolescence, she&#039;s not sure what she wants to do with her life and decides that she wastes too much of her time slacking off via reading books. It&#039;s hard not to see myself in Shizuku, as I feel somewhat lost as to what I should do going forward and end up comparing myself to those who are far more accomplished. Without going into detail, I love how the romance between these two has made her try to become more accomplished and write her fantasy novel. The ending, in particular, is tearjerk inducing because it&#039;s like she finally proved to herself that she is good enough. It&#039;s such an inspiring moment that it instantly got me teary eyed. Shizuku is such a well realized protagonist who grows and learns from her experiences that she feels like a genuine kid struggling to figure out what to do with herself.<br />
<br />
Seiji Amasawa is the love interest and deuteragonist of the film. The very same man who checked out all the different fantasy novels she would end up reading. At first, he comes off as somewhat rude as he loves messing with Shizuku, but the film reveals he is a passionate young man who will stop at nothing to achieve his ambitions. As mentioned, he&#039;s a violin carpenter and plans to move abroad in order to improve his skills. I love the romance between Seiji and Shizuku because Seiji inspires her to work harder and try to improve herself. He helps her realize that writing is her talent and she should prioritize polishing her talent until it&#039;s able to shine brightly. I also just love the dialogue between the two, with their banter coming off as both charming and snarky. Shizuku can&#039;t stand him at first, but she realizes they&#039;re on the same boat. They&#039;re both struggling artists who want to be better at their craft, and while she may believe that he&#039;s just way ahead of her since he has an end goal in mind and she doesn&#039;t, he was the one to help her discover her own path in life and present her a motivation to write to prove herself and to the boy that she grew to love.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s Nishi Shiro, Seiji&#039;s grandfather who owns an antique shop in Shizuku&#039;s town. A kind and talented elder figure who loves collecting unique items, such as a grandfather clock with a fairy tale story. One of the antiques that he owns is Baron, the anthropomorphic cat gentleman doll who got separated from his beloved Louise, another anthropomorphic cat doll. Nishi named the female doll Louise after his beloved since he left Germany before WW2. When he returned, he never saw her or her cat doll again. When Shizuku decides to use the Baron for her story and she&#039;s scared the story isn&#039;t going to be any good, he tells her that she can&#039;t expect perfection, especially when she&#039;s a novice writer. He has the best quote in the film: &quot;When you become an artist, you are like that rock. You are in a raw, natural state with hidden gems inside. You have to dig down deep and find the emerald studs way inside you.&quot; He helps her see her true potential as a writer and inspires her to take action. When growing up, you need a parental figure like Nishi to guide you and make you see the potential that&#039;s deep inside you. Something you might not realize yourself because you might be drowning in self pity like Shizuku.<br />
<br />
There are other characters like Shiho, Shizuku&#039;s older sister who&#039;s worried about her little sister and is wondering if she&#039;s actually doing the work she&#039;s supposed to. There&#039;s Asako, Shizuku&#039;s mother who is going to college and her father Seiya who works as a librarian. These three don&#039;t get too much focus, but they do try to make sure Shizuku is focusing on her work, especially her older sister Shiho. Last but not least, there&#039;s Shizuku&#039;s best friend Yuko, and she mainly has a crush on one of the boys at the beginning of the movie and grows concerns for Shizuku once she starts to focus on writing her book rather than her studies. They&#039;re more in the background, but they do bring a grounded sense of reality to Shizuku&#039;s delusions.<br />
<br />
Finally, there&#039;s the audiovisual department, which is about as outstanding as you&#039;d expect from Studio Ghibli. The vibrant and detailed setting, the expressive character animation, and the whole movie is beautifully hand drawn. Directed by the late Yoshifumi Kondou who sadly passed away at age 47 due to an aneurysm in 1998 caused by overwork. Hayao Miyazaki wanted him to be his replacement and his death is why he took a temporary retirement in the same year Kondou died. The movie&#039;s stellar presentation certainly helps explain why he was favored by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki, as everything about it screams classic Ghibli. The opening song is probably my favorite opening song in the entire Ghibli line up. It invokes this countryside feeling while also being incredibly catchy. I also love how it&#039;s used in the actual plot to help Shizuku gain confidence through her writing as she&#039;s making her own versions of the song and even sings it a few times throughout the film. The voice acting for the dub is also great, as they fully bring out the emotions for the cast and bring their struggles to life.<br />
<br />
All and all, this is one of Ghibli&#039;s best films by a country mile. It&#039;s such a heartfelt tale of self discovery, love, and hard work. Everything about it is so sincere and awe inspiring that I wish more people would talk about this film when talking about Ghibli&#039;s body of work. It&#039;s a charming and beautifully animated film that I would recommend to anyone.<br />

    I have no idea why people enjoyed this movie.  I have never been a very big appreciator of these Miyazaki stamped films, although I don&#039;t necessarily dislike them all, but this film is the worst of them I&#039;ve seen.  Lets go through the details.<br />
<br />
The animation is in constant conflict.  While the backgrounds have some fairly impressive detail, the moving parts of the animation are inconsistent and often poorly done and all movement is extremely choppy.  The backgrounds and characters also don&#039;t seem to work very well together in some situations as if they exist on different layers.  Another example of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37572">
        this disconnect between background and the moving pieces is Scooby Doo, where it seems as if they locked the animators for the characters and those for the background in different rooms and never showed each other the other&#039;s work.<br />
<br />
The sound is downright annoying some of the time.  I dislike the use of Take Me Home Country Roads as essentially the theme song of the movie and each time characters sang in the movie it proved more annoying than impactful in any way, and the rewrites the main character made were pretty terrible.  Also this film takes one from many other Japanese films and employs the &quot;roaring ambiance,&quot; the obnoxious cicada and other such random noises.  Aside from that the miscellaneous background music is not noteworthy, although sometimes not very very well selected, and the voice actors are generally fine.<br />
<br />
Finally, the story and characters have basically nothing going for them.  The characters are generally not believable and flat, the randomness of dialogue is off-putting, the story is slow and boring.<br />
First off, the &quot;romantic element&quot; of this movie feels artificial and forced.  The initial romantic triangle doesn&#039;t make any sense because we don&#039;t even know the character&#039;s relationships with each other in the first place.  When the female lead says she was friends forever with the dude, I didn&#039;t even know they talked.  It&#039;s also extremely awkward and all the characters fill stereotypical roles, the shy girl, the mediator (main character) and the idiot guy.<br />
As for the main romance of the movie, the proposal at the end was extremely annoying and I couldn&#039;t take it seriously at all.  Checking out books to get someone&#039;s attention is the absolute dumbest thing I&#039;ve heard, the most hilarious line of the movie being Shizuku wondering if he was handsome just seeing his name in the books.<br />
Oh it&#039;s also a great romance when the girl doesn&#039;t even know who the guy is and he just inexplicably likes her.<br />
<br />
So yes, in the end, all of these elements mix together to form a sub-par community &quot;classic&quot; that I wouldn&#039;t recommend to anyone.

    Whisper of the Heart perfectly captures the anxieties of growing up and finding your place in the world, and the anxieties faced by any creator finding their creative voice, weaving the two into a spectacular coming-of-age story.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s surprising that this is one of few Ghibli movies to not be directed by either Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata (although Miyazaki was heavily involved with other elements of its production). It possesses both Miyazaki&#039;s incredible skill at visual storytelling, and Takahata&#039;s subtle mastery of conveying plot through emotion.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s almost redundant to say this of any Ghibli movie, but the production job here is incredible. The background art

        is incredible, even moreso than in most of their movies. Despite its urban/suburban setting, the movie manages to seem almost like a fairytale (which is certainly not accidental, as this is a common theme within the movie&#039;s plot).<br />
<br />
More impressive is the characterisation. The leads, Shizuku and Seiji, aren&#039;t especially unique in their own right, but they&#039;re not intended to be. This makes them much easier to relate to. While that would run the risk of making them uninteresting, the way their thoughts and feelings are conveyed in this movie, through subtle details in expressions, or through subtext in dialogue, rather than through unique character traits, makes them seem utterly organic and real, like actual people with worries and doubts and passions like us, not like something a writer thought up.<br />
<br />
The whole movie is rich in subtle nuance. For example, Shizuku is working on a set of lyrics in the first half of the movie. The first and second time we hear them, they&#039;re remarkably different - the second one is influenced by her first fairytale experience in the movie. It never feels the need to state it, but the way the new lyrics mirror her experience, it&#039;s clear how much it meant to her.<br />
<br />
This nuance carries over to the main plot of the movie - Shizuku being impressed by Seiji&#039;s craftsmanship at making violins, and his passion for becoming great at it inpires an insecurity in her about her own ability to create things and her lack of purpose. Along a backdrop of teenage drama and angst, it parallels the same struggle of growing up that we all follow, but it&#039;s never spelled out.<br />
<br />
Final Words: Whisper of the Heart is an exceptionally well-told story, and one that feels very much &quot;from the heart&quot;. It easily stands as my favourite Ghibli movie.<br />

    Yoshifumi Kondo&#039;s first and only film for Studio Ghibli (he died a few years after it was completed), WHISPER OF THE HEART, is an absolute delight. Gentle but not syrupy, this modern-day story about a girl and boy discovering that they have a lot in common is beautifully animated, compellingly characterized, and full of heart (pun intended). <br />
<br />
Based on a graphic-novel by Aoi Hiragi with a script by Hayao Miyazaki, the movie centers on Shizuku Tsukishima, a somewhat absent-minded but sympathetic young High School student who would rather read books from the library rather than study for her school tests. Shizuku discovers that a certain

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15232">
        Seiji Amasawa checks out the same books that she does, as detailed on the library checkout cards. When Shizuku first meets Seiji in person, she thinks he&#039;s a &quot;stupid jerk&quot; (he makes a somewhat snide remark about her supposedly &quot;corny&quot; writing abilities), but she soon discovers that he is a strangely gentle fellow who longs to become a violinist yet feels that his playing isn&#039;t as good as others say it is. Shizuku can relate to this, given that she doubts her talents as a writer. The story takes a dramatic turn when Shizuku discovers that Seiji will be temporarily leaving for Italy to train as a violinist. This inspires Shizuku to pursue her own talent, and she proceeds to write her first story. <br />
<br />
At the surface, this would sound like a rather simple love story, but that&#039;s not all WHISPER OF THE HEART has going for it. Miyazaki&#039;s screenplay ingeniously allows the viewers to identify with Shizuku as she expresses the following emotions: frustration, disappointment, fear, joy, and vulnerability. This is displayed not only in her growing relationship with Seiji, but with her daily interactions with her friends, family, and her inner thoughts. We even see Shizuku deal with humiliation (and even guilt) when a boy reveals he had a crush on her all along, yet she only considered him a friend. Sometimes certain movies can delve a little too much on these angst-ridden elements, but in WHISPER OF THE HEART, this is handled in a way that is not so overbearing (or frustrating even) to the viewer. <br />
<br />
The film also works in a subplot involving a captivating antique shop containing all kinds of sparkling treasures, including a charming statuette of a cat known as &quot;Baron&quot;. The kindly owner, Mr. Nishi, is warm and supportive of Shizuku, especially when she decides to write her story based on the aforementioned &quot;Baron&quot; statue. He reminded me of Uncle Pom from CASTLE IN THE SKY, a similarly gentle old man who sadly only showed up for one scene; having this kind of character play an even bigger role in WHISPER is a delight. <br />
<br />
Speaking of which, the scenes where Shizuku imagines her story are among the movie&#039;s most imaginatively animated moments. The film&#039;s artwork, typical of Ghibli, is top notch, but one particular sequence (one of the studio&#039;s first experiments with computer animation) is especially stunning. Here we see the Baron come alive and escort a fair young maiden (who strangely resembles Shizuku) across a graceful sky of floating islets. The character of the Baron is quite charismatic and one of the more memorable characters in the film; the only other notable feline we see is a pudgy furball known as Moon (aka Muta), who appears quite grumpy whenever Shizuku tries to talk to him. <br />
<br />
Incidentally, both of these felines appeared in another Studio Ghibli production, THE CAT RETURNS, a pleasant but merely forgettable family flick considered by many (myself included) as an inferior spin-off. Not that Hiroyuki Morita&#039;s film doesn&#039;t have any charm, but WHISPER has something that THE CAT RETURNS didn&#039;t have, hence why it holds up better. <br />
<br />
Interestingly, John Denver&#039;s immortal &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; plays a crucial part in the story: the first half of the movie deals with Shizuku trying to translate the song into Japanese. This part of the story obviously gave Disney a lot of problems in terms of translation, hence why it was delayed from its English release for quite some time. Fortunately, their dub handles it in a way that remains true to the original intent, yet at the same time makes it easier for American audiences to connect with. Here Shizuku tries to write her own lyrics for the song, with each attempt improving as she learns to write from the heart. This approach works rather well, as I could sense little, if any, lost in the translation. <br />
<br />
As much as I&#039;ve heard people criticize Disney for the actors they&#039;ve chosen to voice the characters in their dubs for Ghibli&#039;s works, I have practically enjoyed every one of their voice casts (save perhaps THE WIND RISES). WHISPER OF THE HEART is another one of my favorite dubs from them. As the insecure Shizuku, Brittany Snow speaks in a very expressive, believable way without being saccharine, and has an equally lovely singing voice. David Gallagher--no stranger to voice acting, given his work in KINGDOM HEARTS--provides an excellent contrast to Snow through his understated yet effective turn as Seiji. Cary Elwes reprises his role as the debonair Baron from THE CAT RETURNS. The person who takes the prize for best acting in the dub, though, is Harold Gould, who brings just the right amount of warmth, poignancy, and compassion to the kindly Mr. Nishi. Of course there will always be fans who prefer the Japanese version, but for me, the dub gets my vote.<br />
<br />
However you choose to see WHISPER OF THE HEART, this is another winner from one of Japan&#039;s greatest animation studios. I never expected to love it as much as I did, and chances are you will too, if you allow yourself to be charmed by its warm heart.

    A beautiful story that is so true-to-life and poignant... <br />
<br />
The characters have the depth to give what might have been merely another daily life story that magical twist that has made Studio Ghibli so iconic.<br />
<br />
With the honest depiction of the struggles teenagers encounter when facing &amp;quot;growing up&amp;quot; and the obvious thought put into every scene, the whole film moves the characters from nondescript children to young adults destined for something more. A coming-of-age that is anything but ordinary.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s really no more to say for it. Simply outstanding.

    Honestly, it was really boring to me that I almost fell asleep. Also the ending just came out of no where. Idk is this is a spoiler but I don&#039;t care because this movie is like 22 years old, but when the 2 main characters were like, &quot;We should get married someday.&quot;...&quot;Yeah! We should!&quot;... then the credits just roll up. I was like...&quot;Wait....That&#039;s the ending?&quot; It caught me by surprise. <br />

The Story was boring, I couldn&#039;t get myself into it. It&#039;s just about this nerd girl who loves to read and she learns new things and she hangs out with this kid who she has

    High school has always been a popular setting for anime. Most anime associate high school with slice of life, comedy, romance, and of late, harem. This has worked out very well for most anime, but there was one little thing that always bugged me for some reason – it was all just a backdrop and never actually felt like one. The teachers are non-existent, the school is magically empty when the male and the female lead need to be alone and most importantly, the main characters were always a two-goody shoes or a precocious little punk, on whose shoulders the fate of the world rests.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33778">
        Even an anime called “School Days” revolved less around the actual school days. Very few anime actually use this backdrop to carve a story out of.<br />
<br />
And one of them is Whisper of the Heart, an anime movie produced by Studio Ghibli in collaboration with Walt Disney studios. Released around 15 years ago, this movie continues to be entertaining to this day.<br />
<br />
Whisper of the Heart is a relaxing two hour movie about the confused and enigmatic junior high student, Shizuku.  Troubled on what to do after graduating, she finds solace in reading fairytales. On the way to the library, she meets a cat, who she follows to a quaint shop called “The World Emporium”. There she meets people and objects which help her listen to the whispers of her heart.<br />
<br />
There’s not much to the story, really. This movie was primarily meant for children, so don’t go in expecting any complex plot with devious twists and turns. It is a very simple tale on how Shizuku tries to discover her true talents. That said, it does not mean that this feature is uninteresting. It was amazing how such a timid storyline kept me entertained for two whole hours.<br />
<br />
The animation is trademark Ghibli style, with the chubby girls, detailed backgrounds and the smiling characters. But you know that when two heavyweights such as Ghibli and Disney come together, they sure aren’t going to fail on the technical aspect. Their previous collaborations (Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, Howl’s Moving Castle) are testament to that fact.<br />
<br />
The music is peaceful and fits the bill. The movie’s main song, Country Road, is a lovely number and very catchy.<br />
<br />
The cast is pretty small, but it’s good. The protagonist is Shizuku, a spunky junior high student. Her good-humored family and friends comprise the rest of the cast, but I’m not going to go to deep into that. The casual voice-acting fits in well with the anime’s atmosphere.<br />
<br />
The reason why Whisper of the Heart is so charming is because of its impeccable attention to detail. Just trust me when I say that the level of detailing to the characters’ unconscious actions and the constantly active background is ridiculously high. Things like a pencil lead snapping when writing furiously, pulling back of the skirt when sitting down, moving to the side of the road when an occasional car passes by, spacing out when looking out the window...I could go on all day. Long story short, this anime looks and feels very natural. The director and the storyboard artists have clearly put their heart and soul into making this anime, and it reflects on the quality of the movie.<br />
<br />
But, when it’s all said and done, this movie does have its fair share of flaws. The start is extremely slow paced and I can already see a few people dozing off by the half hour mark. The show can be a bit melancholy at times and this is quite strange, seeing that it was meant for children. The ending was abrupt and could’ve used more build up.<br />
<br />
All in all, Whispers of the Heart is a lovely movie that is sure to put a smile on your face with its realistic take on a girl’s junior high life.<br />
 <br />
 [ THE WRAP-UP ]<br />
 <br />
Whisper of the Heart is your usual Studio Ghibli movie. Although aimed at a younger audience, this pleasant anime is a fun ride for kids and a nostalgic journey for adults. The show’s plot is simple, but it has a way of engulfing you into the picturesque world of the characters. The unimpeachable detailing to the characters’ actions adds on to the already realistic anime. The show takes its own sweet time to get off its feet and the ending was a bit off. But you can look past these shortcomings, because of the charming shojo elements that it oozes. Although the movie is 15 years old, it is able to hold its own in the audio visual department. Like the ore from which precious metals are extracted, this movie is rough, unpolished and natural. And that is exactly what makes it completely worth your time. Like, the MAL score of 8 says, Whispers of the Heart is a very good anime. No more, no less.<br />

    I&#039;m not a great fan of Studio Ghibli&#039;s films, but this one is definitely worth seeing.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
The main plot is quite simple but its plain beauty makes it endearing rather than dull. The pacing is very relaxed, fitting with the general nostalgic atmosphere of the story. Of course there&#039;re a few flaws, such as a few very cheesy scenes (ie ending) and a side plot which feels somewhat out of place and is almost separate from the main storyline (the couple at Shizuku&#039;s school).<br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
The backgrounds are excellent. Not only are they detailed, but also have a certain artsy charm that makes them stand out among the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3944">
        sea of look-alike anime depictions of urban landscapes. The only thing that could be improved about these are the colours, as they feel a bit faded. The characters, however, in classic Ghibli traditions are mediocre at best - overly round faces, unnatural movements, ever-open mouths, colourless eyes - definitely the lowest point of this review.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
The sound in this movie (both voices and background audio) is strikingly great. I was very surprised to find a 15 year old movie with such quality audio - it has probably the best channel distribution I&#039;ve yet to hear, so that even with my badly arranged (all on one desk) 5.1 system it sounded as if I was sitting right next to the characters. The theme song Country Roads fits very well with the rest of the movie and completes the atmosphere without being in-your-face.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
Both main characters are extremely generic - to me they felt identical to the ones in Laputa and the heroine of The Cat Returns, and very similar to the rest of Ghibli&#039;s movies. Nonetheless, they&#039;re likeable and go through enough character growth during the movie to be more than skin deep. There&#039;s also the fact that they seem to act a bit too childishly for their age.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
This is the best thing about this film. Its depiction of an innocent childhood and puppy love is very realistic and brings on a sweet sense of nostalgia. My own childhood was much closer to what&#039;s depicted here than any other anime I&#039;ve seen (or any live action movie, for that matter), so it strikes close to heart with me. The little slice-of-life details are a nice touch, though that does keep the main story in the background for most of the movie&#039;s length.<br />
<br />
Overall, despite the few flaws it has, Whisper of the Heart is a classic that I would recommend for anyone who can appreciate a nostalgic laid-back love story and doesn&#039;t mind the occasional bit of naivete and cheesiness.<br />
<br />
Finally, even though the average of the 4 separate scores is closer to an 8 than a 9, I do think that in this particular case the total is much more than the sum of its parts so it does deserve a 9 overall score.

    Generally speaking, I love Ghibli movies, but this one was kind of dull. Very heavy on the teen romance, very light on the magical elements. (And the theme song being a play on &quot;Country Roads&quot; was a little... odd.) Visually, it was beautiful. I just kept waiting for the story to go somewhere, and it didn&#039;t really. Not to mention it has one of the most abrupt endings I&#039;ve ever seen in any story.<br />
<br />
Which might sound a little harsh, because I did like the characters well enough. Seiji got off to a rough start, but I really liked him once they started developing his character.

        I&#039;m a big fan of stories about people who are really passionate about their craft. Shizuku felt very relatable too. I loved how that passion for writing took over her life by the mid-point. And I really felt that pressure-- how she&#039;s not even in high school yet but feels like if she doesn&#039;t have her life figured out by now, she&#039;s doomed for failure. (And the romance is very sweet, but a love story is never enough to stand alone for me.) <br />
<br />
It felt like a very slice-of-life, glimpse into one tiny moment in a person&#039;s life, coming of age sort of story. I just wish it went somewhere. I would have even settled for it switching a bit more between Shizuku&#039;s real life and Shizuku mentally living out the story about the Baron she was writing. Neither of those stories really felt like they had enough substance to them. I kept waiting for some kind of concrete life lesson to be communicated. The credits started rolling, and I just had to stare for a few seconds like, &quot;Really? That&#039;s it?&quot;

    Whisper of the Heart is unusual for a Studio Ghibli film in not featuring any magic, or at least nothing supernatural. That said, it is at least as much about magic as many of their films full of witches and spirits and demons. Rather than the usual fantastic adventure stories which are merely facilitated by magic, this is a celebration of story-telling, music, creativity and love - all the sorts of things that make real life magical.<br />
<br />
Our heroine is Shizuku, a girl of around fourteen who dreams of being a writer, and like most aspiring writers she reads heavily. Borrowing book after book from the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35260">
        library, she keeps noticing one name re-appearing as a previous borrower in them - a boy at her school, who shows some interest before being unreasonably mean to her, in the way that boys usually are when they&#039;re attracted to a girl, at least in Hayao Miyazaki films.<br />
<br />
Their paths cross again after she befriends the owner of a wonderful antiques shop, where her imagination is sparked an old statuette of a cat with glowing eyes. The owner turns out to be the boy&#039;s grandfather, part of a welcoming clan, and they bond over music sessions and the telling of stories. The boy dreams of being a master violin maker, his ambition mirroring and inspiring her own.<br />
<br />
Whisper is sometimes described as a prequel to the equally lovely The Cat Returns, but this is a very different sort of a film with little in common by way of plot, characters or atmosphere. The Cat Returns might be better described as a sequel to the story Shizuku writes here about &#039;Baron, the Cat Baron&#039; - perhaps it&#039;s an example of her more mature work. In contrast to the later film, a swashbuckling romp mainly set in the magical Cat Kingdom, Whisper is low-key, mundane and understated. I don&#039;t mean to make it sound boring - it absolutely isn&#039;t - but it lacks the hyperactivity of so many films aimed at kids, though with its simple charm and moral lessons I assume they really are intended to be its main audience.<br />
<br />
Miyazaki, who adapted the screenplay from a graphic novel but did not direct this, is not someone who feels the need to steer clear of sentimentality. Some people might find it cloying at one or two points, but I have to say I feared much, much worse from a film with a name like &#039;Whisper of the Heart&#039; - which is perhaps unfair, since the original title translates as &#039;if you listen closely&#039;. On the whole it manages to be sweet without being sickly, and I love the animation and the quiet way the characters develop. The only fault I could find is for me, I was expecting, I don&#039;t know, more from a Miyazaki film. After all, this is the franchise which brought us movies such as Princess Mononoke or Porco Rosso.

    mimi wo sumaseba is an aesthetically pleasing movie that gives you a sensation of nostalgia and comfort and has a calming atmosphere. the highlights of this movie were the parts concerning inspiration — feeling inspired by someone —, seeking to discover your own talents, exploring your abilities, polishing yourself (as seiji&#039;s grandpa says), as if we were uncut gems; the appeal of the imaginary world created by shizuku; the sweet moments between shizuku and seiji&#039;s grandfather, when various ideas about maturation and coming of age appear (and i have to admit i like that kind of character)<br />
but the movie includes also quite odd and incomprehensible

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335298">
        situations. having watched this movie again, after 5 years, i feel very disappointed about some things. the movie&#039;s pace is very fast (not that this is a bad thing itself), unlike what i remembered, and some things seem incomplete, disconnected. the romance between shizuku and seiji ended up having a very weird outcome, a fast and inexplicable one. i believe the major question here is that shizuku &gt;is&lt; a teenage girl, extremely dreamy, who idealizes everything, and by chance the movie turns everything she creates in her head into reality. and that to me is a flaw that makes the movie trivial. when shizuku, after meeting seiji again, says that she had created the whole story because of him, that she &quot;did it because of him&quot;, this made no sense at all. if they had used the inspiration seiji gave her as a tool she could use to mature, discover and polish herself, putting this together with the moments she had with seiji&#039;s grandpa, things would have worked out a lot better — and that&#039;s what i remembered. but, in reality, the movie chooses a way simpler, superficial outcome, and everything ends up in a kind of taken-out-of-nowhere romance.<br />
p.s.: seiji&#039;s extremely specific ambition, for some reason, seemed strange to me. and situations like sugimura&#039;s confession, at first, looked like they made no difference in the story as well. but i&#039;m still thinking about that<br />
<br />
EM PORTUGUÊS:<br />
mimi wo sumaseba é um filme bonito visualmente, que passa sensação de nostalgia e conforto e tem uma atmosfera calma. os pontos altos desse filme foram as partes sobre inspiração — se sentir inspirado por alguém —, buscar descobrir seus próprios talentos, se aventurar com suas próprias habilidades, lapidar a si mesmo (como diz o avô do seiji), como se fôssemos joias brutas; o apelo do mundo imaginário criado pela shizuku; os momentos doces e bonitos entre a shizuku e o avô do seiji, em que várias mensagens de amadurecimento são passadas (e eu tenho que admitir que gosto desse tipo de personagem)<br />
mas o filme também tem coisas muito estranhas e difíceis de engolir. vendo esse filme de novo, depois de 5 anos, me decepcionei bastante com algumas coisas. o ritmo é bastante rápido (não que isso em si seja um defeito), diferente do que eu lembrava, e algumas coisas parecem meio incompletas, desconexas. o romance entre a shizuku e o seiji tomou um caminho muito estranho, muito rápido e inexplicável. acho que a grande questão aqui é que a shizuku &gt;É&lt; uma menina adolescente, extremamente sonhadora, que idealiza tudo, e por um acaso o filme realiza tudo o que ela idealiza, e isso pra mim é uma falha que torna o filme muito trivial. quando a shizuku, ao reencontrar o seiji, diz que se esforçou e fez a história por causa dele, que &quot;fez tudo por ele&quot;, isso não fez sentido algum. se tivessem usado a inspiração que o seiji plantou nela como uma ferramenta pra ela se descobrir, amadurecer e se lapidar, juntando isso com os momentos com o avô do seiji, as coisas teriam se desenvolvido de uma forma muito boa — e era isso que eu lembrava. mas, na verdade, o filme escolhe um caminho muito mais simplório, muito mais superficial, e tudo termina em um romance meio tirado do nada.<br />
p.s.: a ambição extremamente específica do seiji por algum motivo me causou estranhamento. e situações como a declaração do sugimura, a princípio, não parecem fazer muito sentido pra história também. mas ainda tô pensando sobre isso<br />

    Whisper of the Heart is another Studio Ghibli film that focuses of love, life, and what it is like to be a teenager.  It is a bit sappy and predictable, but if love stories are your thing then you will probably like this film.  To put it short, the story is about a bibliophile who dreams of living in a fairy tale until she meets a special someone who shows her that fairy tales can be a reality if one looks hard enough.  <br />
 <br />
The story of Whisper of the Heart is a heartfelt and somewhat realistic story of what life could

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35857">
        be like for a young girl who dreams of love and adventure while reading countless stories about fiction and fairy tales.  It starts slow and finishes slow.  I am a bit surprised there was enough to the story that it would fill nearly two hours.  It flows like a slice of life story and leaves you feeling inspired and encouraged like most slice of life stories should.  What I found to be the most interesting element about the film was the few references to other previous and future Ghibli films.  It was fun to try to pick out the little references here and there to see to which film they could go.  That is all I will say about the subject.  It is up to you to find the references yourself.  <br />
 <br />
The animation was great.  What else would you expect from a Studio Ghibli film?  There is not much else to say about it.  I enjoyed the art as always, which is a large part of why I like Studio Ghibli&#039;s films.  <br />
 <br />
Sound wise, the film was inspiring.  The music fit each mood perfectly.  The voice acting was great too.  I loved the voices that went with each character.  They just seemed to fit almost perfectly, as if the characters could indeed be alive.<br />
 <br />
The characters are another reason I watch and love Studio Ghibli&#039;s films.  They relatable and often address thoughts, fears, and emotions that are common or have been personally felt.  Whisper of the Heart is no exception.  The main character was lovable and relatable as well as admirable.  Her resolve to do her best and be her best was inspiring.  I have noticed that Studio Ghibli has an affinity for short brown haired heroines.  The other characters in the film were likable as well, predictable and tropey but likable.  <br />
 <br />
Overall, I enjoyed myself watching the film.  It was sappy and hard to believe at times, at times most of the time, but it was enjoyable.  It was a slice of life story that was refreshing but shallow.  One you do not really know why you watched it, but you enjoyed yourself nonetheless.  If you like, those type of stories, you will like the film but if you do not you might want to watch it anyway just so you can say you have watched it and complain to your friends later.  <br />
 <br />
Whisper of the Heart was, overall, a good film, not great but good.  It is a lesser known, lesser-watched film but worth your time if you chose to watch it.  The story is relaxing and free flowing but shallow while the characters are relatable.  Nevertheless the animation is great and the sound wonderful.  The enjoyment is there too.  It a great film for a lazy evening or spacer between loads of homework.

    Quick Thoughts:<br />
I think it&#039;s an average movie overall. The animation quality is solid as expected, but there&#039;s not much that stands out other than that. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
A girl (Shizuku), who enjoys reading, notices the same name in the checkout slips of all the books she checks out. She eventually meets him, admires his talents, and then aspires to be someone who&#039;s abilities can match up. I thought it was cool see an example of a mutually beneficial relationship where people inspire growth in one another. The ending was predictable (and cheesy), but It works fine for this story. I think my main issues with the story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357278">
        that it took to long to get going, and that the setting was generic and forgettable..<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
I think Shizuku was too basic considering how much of the movie is focused on her. She&#039;s very much just an average high school with a strong interest reading/writing. Seiji could be considered the other main character, but he lacked presence due to story-related issues. Attempts were made to create some development and drama among Shizuku&#039;s friend group, but the characters involved had so little screentime that those scenes ended up feeling unnecessary.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I got some enjoyment out of the movie&#039;s easiness to follow, and its animation quality. Like many other Ghibli films, there&#039;s a focus on coming-of-age themes, so I&#039;d imagine you&#039;ll like if you&#039;re a Ghibli fan.

    Every aspect of this film was outstanding, from character to plot to artwork. Hayao Miyazaki is without a doubt a genius, but he outdid himself with film. Shizuku Tsukishima, the female protagonist, went through her journey of self-realization through her hard work and dedication to find her where her true passion lies and also find her talent. Along the journey, not only did she learn more about herself as a person but she found inspiration, love and motivation from those around her. While I do have sentimental attachments with the film, I rewatched it to understand the plot and characters better and every time I
