    I&#039;ll keep this short and simple.<br />
<br />
Major is the definition of the word underrated. It is very unfortunate that people often overlook this series simply because it falls under the sports category. It is SO much more than that. I have recommended this anime to people countless times and will continue doing so because not only do I love it, but I believe it has the power to inspire. <br />
<br />
The main character of the story is named Honda Goro (changed to Honda Shigeno after a tragic event). He is gifted in pitching and is absolutely in love with baseball. He has the tendency to bring out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23214">
        the best in other people simply because of his passion and attitude for the sport. People seemingly gather around him for this reason. No matter how grim a situation may look, he never gives up. The most impressive part about this anime (besides the storyline of course) is the character development. As the series progresses you will witness the characters grow physically and mentally. It is also very easy to get attached to the characters since they are all unique within their own right. <br />
<br />
All I have to say is that the first season starts off REALLY strong. Take your time with this anime. It is really easy to get addicted with Major. A person can literally fly through the episodes because of how engaging it is. <br />
<br />
Honestly, the real fun begins when you get past the first season.

    Major, 154 episodes, 3 OVA and 1 movie long series. Normally it takes more than a month for me to watch series this long. Usually I get bored before the ending and start new random series so in the end it can easily take like a year for me to complete all of it. How long did it take from me to go trough all of Major then? 6 fucking days.<br />
<br />
<br />
Review is to whole Major as you might have guessed. Spoiler free.<br />
<br />
<br />
The story of Major is pretty bromaculous and manly, but all in all simple. Goro, our MC, is 4 year-old guy who likes baseball

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57231">
        because his father is professional baseball player. 6 fucking days later Goro is 34 years-old professional baseball player who teaches kids how to play baseball. How shit got from the start to the end is one hell of an amazing trip. Including drama, comedy, utter awesomeness, character development of one of a kind, romantic subplot, one of the most awe-inspiring shitz since GTO and yeah, some baseball too. <br />
<br />
<br />
One of the first questions people seem to ask is &quot;Do I need to like baseball to like Major?&quot; Well I dunno. Do you need to like school to like Great Teacher Onizuka? Do you need to be otaku to like anime? Well, those questions doesn&#039;t matter. The point is, almost everything I know about baseball is because I watched Major. Almost none plays it in my country anyway. Do I like Major then? A big Yes!<br />
<br />
<br />
The characters of Major are one of the strongest part of the series. Goro is more awe-inspiring than anyone. If he loses consciousness during the game then he finishes the match unconsciously. He is awesome like that. Don&#039;t get me wrong, he isn&#039;t ultimate badass, superhero nor the typical shonen protag who wins because he is a ninja or some other shit like that. All he does is his best. It doesn&#039;t matter if he loses or wins, he just wants to see what he is capable to do. All there is for him is the moment, he doesn&#039;t plan to play baseball in the future, he plans to play the next game and whateverthefuck happens after that happens when it happens if it happens. Don&#039;t mind, don&#039;t mind. Fukkyah. Goro is now my favorite character of all time.<br />
<br />
<br />
So in the end Goro alone makes the characters great and that&#039;s it... wait, NO. I still remember the names of almost all the million side characters. That&#039;s pretty rare for me since Japanese shit sounds like Gibberish anyway. As I said before the series includes character development one of a kind. By that I don&#039;t mean solely the MC but actually rest of the fuckhuge cast as well. Gibson is Jesus, Sato gets bitches like no other, Shimizu is the culmination of sweety. Those are just some characters from the first episodes. What makes Major so great from the character part is how every single side character is in important role and nothing would be possible if even one them was missing. Baseball is a team sports and author really gives value to that. If one the team members is delinquent who doesn&#039;t give a fuck, then he changes to a guy who shits rainbows. Developmentyeah. Sure we have other sports series e.g. Eyeshield 21, Slam Dunk, Cross Game, H2 which are about team work as well but none of those manages to come to Major&#039;s level in terms of characters by any means. <br />
<br />
<br />
Major is objectively best animu ever and completely flawless. Well lolno. It has problems and flaws like everything has. Characters&#039; actions aren&#039;t always exactly the most believable thing ever. Writing is sometimes simplistic. 4th season has problems with pacing, language barrier in american league is confusing, 2nd season could have more rewarding ending. One could say the series is predictable, which it obviously is if you start guessing who wins and who loses since there ain&#039;t so many results anyway. But Major isn&#039;t about the destination but how to get there. Did I predict all of it? No, not even close. The author knows his shit very well - plot twists, sports series has those as well. Is it realistic? Yes, very. All in all one of the most realistic sport series I&#039;ve seen. I thought the series would be repetitive towards the end since it&#039;s just baseball but now I&#039;m glad of being wrong. There also doesn&#039;t seem to be this thing called  &quot;just baseball&quot; in existence.<br />
<br />
<br />
The art is simple and beautiful, something I would call smooth and perfectly fitting to the series. Animation is obviously somewhat old and not perfect but something only faggotass would complain about. Visual effect are rather cool during action moments. These all goes for better during the show. Especially after season 3. The sounds, well voice acting is actually impressive as fuck. Goro&#039;s voice after 1st season is one of the most original and memorable ones I&#039;ve heard. Tashiro sounds like he has 20 inch dick. I get chills everytime Shimizu says &quot;Honda&quot; (Goro&#039;s old last name) That&#039;s definitely a good thing in my eyes. And other characters (voice actors, weh) are awesome like that as well. Music is great, not just something worth of including to the series but something which I actually listened earlier today because it&#039;s good. Sound director knows his shit like all people behind the show seems to know so lets that be it.<br />
<br />
<br />
When it comes to enjoyment Major broke all my expectations by being more awesome than I could have Imagined. After getting older and seeing lot of series it comes harder to enjoy something because quality and logic comes more important due education and other useless shit. Major does great job on fitting the quality standards. It quite literally reminded me what enjoying something means. As it being a baseball series I thought I would end up watching baseball games, but the series isn&#039;t like that. I was there on the field experiencing it all. I learnt a lot, but baseball isn&#039;t the thing I learned the most. The series grasp the viewers by being dramatic, thrilling and fun to watch all at the same time, atmosphere being godly. Did I laugh? Yeah, it&#039;s funnier than gintama. Did I cry? Yeah, a lot. Not so much because of the drama but because it&#039;s so awe-inspiring. The series was partly so exciting that I had problems on changing to new episodes fast enough. I also got heart attacks everytime the romance side developed to some direction. In the end Major is one of the most enjoyable series I&#039;ve seen. To make it clear, I&#039;m not saying the series is great because I enjoyed it so much. I&#039;m saying the series is so great that it&#039;s extremely hard for not to enjoy it.<br />

    Before you read this review, I would like to say that before watching Major I have never watched or played in a baseball game before. (My country has no baseball love &amp;gt;_&amp;gt;) Despite that, I knew some of the basics from a few video games I&#039;ve tried a little of before. I cannot vouch for those who are already familiar with baseball as I will be reviewing from the point of view of a newbie.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
This is actually pretty typical. Boy strives to become the best in something, which in this case is baseball. Honda Goro tries to take after his father as a pitcher who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4805">
        plays in the pro league in Japan. That&#039;s basically all you&#039;re gonna get. They play baseball to try to get to the next &amp;quot;level&amp;quot;, fighting stronger opponents as they go on.<br />
<br />
However there are various plot advances as well as drama thrown into the mix, so don&#039;t go in thinking this is just a tournament-after-tournament anime. <br />
<br />
Art<br />
Art is very solid and pleasing although the animation does get a little sloppy at certain times. However, it is well done during important parts, especially during games. I won&#039;t go so far as to say this is any ground-breaking animation, but it serves its purpose. After all, this is a baseball anime, not something that has flashy explosions.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
I absolutely loved the soundtrack. Very few songs used in the background actually are able to make me find myself humming them unconsciously later onward. There are quite a few notable pieces used throughout the series and they all carry out their duty in helping to further emote scenes.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
This is where the series shines for me. I enjoyed the character development that Major had. As baseball is a team sport, there is also a lot of focus on developing relationships within the team, and how problems arise and are solved amongst one another. The characters are all very likable (well, with a few exceptions), and its fun to watch them interact with one another.<br />
<br />
The show also focuses quite moderately on family relationships. There are a few issues which come up within Goro&#039;s family and it shows how he as a child, handles them. I found certain scenes to be quite touching also.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
Uh, I enjoyed this. A lot. It&#039;s my favorite sports anime. Although it isn&#039;t without its flaws, I found it a great watch. If you enjoy seeing a character &amp;quot;grow&amp;quot;, then you will like this. Not too sure about those who are familiar with baseball though, as it helped as a device to pique my interest.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
Amongst all the seasons, I found this one to be the strongest. (Though this is not to say the other seasons are vastly inferior.) You should give at least this first season a try, even if you don&#039;t like baseball, as the character relations are great to watch no matter what sport they are playing.

    I started watching Major with the expectation that it would be your stereotypical sports anime.  And if you boil it down to its bones, it sort of is.  But it&#039;s the meat of the story, the actual conflicts and the actual relationships and the actual characters makes this a really entertaining series to watch.<br />
<br />
Story:  The story focuses on Honda Goro, who is in kindergarten when the show starts.  The first quarter or so of the series focuses on Goro in kindergarten and just establishing his personality, life and family and friends.  The rest of the series jumps ahead to when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4265">
        Goro starts little league and... let the baseball begin!<br />
<br />
Art:  It&#039;s clean and crisp and pretty simple.  I certainly didn&#039;t have any complaints.  The style doesn&#039;t have as much depth as the more mature series out there, but I think it&#039;s appropriate for the subject matter and the ages of the characters.  In other words, it suits the story. =)<br />
<br />
Sound:  The OP/ED are fine... whereas I don&#039;t love them (and I so rarely do), they don&#039;t bother me in anyway either, which is pretty good, imo. ;)  I did like the voice acting.  I thought they did a good job with their characters and their emotions without going overboard and overacting the way some shows do.  There is a little Engrish, but... I figure if you watch enough anime, you just get used to it -- it&#039;s intended for a Japanese audience after all.<br />
<br />
Character:  Goro&#039;s great.  I found myself rooting for him and cheering him on; he&#039;s just really charismatic.  He&#039;s enthusiastic and single-minded and I can&#039;t help but appreciate that type of personality, especially in a sports anime.  His father is loveable and one of my favorite anime dads.  Even his kindergarten teacher is cute and likeable.  And during the course of the show, you get to see a bunch of teammates and opponents that have their own brand of flavor and charm that adds nicely to the mix.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:  This probably sounds so cliche and fake, but seriously... I laughed, I cried, I groaned and I cheered.  For real.  And maybe that says something more about me than the show, but it was an unexpected emotional roller coaster in a way.  I mean, I really thought it was just going to be another generic shounen and it would just kill some time, but it ended up being compelling and I really felt sucked in and interested.  So much so that I&#039;m currently still watching it in its fourth season (btw, girls, Goro grows up to be kind of a hottie and so does Toshi ;D).<br />
<br />
Just for reference:  S1 focuses on elementary school level little league; S2 Goro&#039;s in his last year of middle school and his first year of high school; S3 is the rest of high school; and S4 is Goro post-high school.

    I was MAJORly excited to watch Major. I was afraid of it being a MAJOR disappointment, but it ended up being MAJORly fun! <br />
<br />
Ok no more major puns, I promise! Major Season 1 is pretty much your standard sports shounen. It&#039;s very well made, but it has a lot of the same strengths and weaknesses as other sports related shows.<br />
<br />
The best part about Major would have to be the characters. They spend quite a bit of time developing most of the players on the team, as well as other characters, like Goro&#039;s rivals (the main character). It&#039;s pretty easy to get into the baseball games

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14050">
        that you watch because the show does a good job at making you care about the &quot;good guys&quot;.<br />
<br />
As for the baseball itself, it can be quite intense, but the show kind of falls into the trap of being a little ridiculous, like a lot of sports shows can be. You&#039;ll see unreal comebacks, ridiculous strategies, and elementary school kids that have the ability to beat high schoolers. Sometimes it&#039;s OK, but other times it can really ruin your ability to become immersed with the show.<br />
<br />
The games can be a bit predictable at times as well, I found it kind of obvious when they would win and when they would lose, but I was still usually very into the games, so I have to give them a lot of credit for that. The last game especially has no silly gimmicks like some other games, and ends up being a great conclusion to the season.<br />
<br />
While the 2nd half of the show concentrates on Goro&#039;s little league baseball team, the 1st half of the show actually doesn&#039;t have that much baseball, it more concentrates on building characters and a storyline. And surprisingly, the part of the show without baseball isn&#039;t bad at all. There is a somewhat predictable romance storyline, and then a pretty shocking twist that I didn&#039;t see coming that turns everything upside down. It felt a little lacking and boring at times, but I still enjoyed the first half of the show overall. So while the main appeal of the show is baseball, they do a good job with the non-baseball elements.<br />
<br />
Another thing they do a good job with is the art and sound. The animation is crisp, the art is mostly pretty, although I think the baseball fields look kind of ugly and unfinished. The music adds a lot to some of the more epic moments during the baseball, and is very good.<br />
<br />
Overall, Major doesn&#039;t end up being a major-league disappointment, but it doesn&#039;t end up being major-league good either. It&#039;s more of a &quot;very good&quot; show. People who know baseball may be a little turned off by some ridiculous parts, but the baseball is still exciting, and the non-baseball stuff isn&#039;t half-bad either. Major is a show I would reccomend to anyone who likes sports shounen.

    Major is a definite must-see for anyone that enjoys sports anime/manga.  The plot is pretty much your typical addictive shonen sports anime, but there is some noteworthy drama elements in there as well. I personally enjoyed the series very much, some parts were definitely tear-jerkers, the rest was adrenaline packed baseball. <br />
The character development is well done, you either sympathize, hate or fall in love with them X3. Also the graphics and sound are all good so that does not deter from the enjoyment of the series at all.<br />
The opening/ending  themes are quite nice in compare to most OSTs.

    Holy cow. Watching this Anime was one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made. Ever.<br />
<br />
I was in the middle of studying when I decided to pull this off of my plan to watch list for a small break. Next thing I knew, a week and a half passed without me doing a thing.<br />
I could NOT stop watching this show. It is extremely dangerous and should not be seen unless prepared.<br />
<br />

    I&#039;m kind of disappointed with this series. I started watching this cause I it was pretty highly rated and I wanted to watch sports anime. I thought the main character&#039;s family background was too dramatic and I wasn&#039;t really keen to watch a soap opera that was dragged out for way too long. The plot development and struggles were also dramatic. There were bullying issues, death, and injuries. <br />
<br />
I consistently thought it shouldn&#039;t be this difficult to actually join a team and play baseball. Also, the main character is obnoxious, arrogant, looks down on others, a genius in baseball and kind of sexist. I really

    I signed up on AnimeList especially to give this review, I just got through the 3rd season of Major after watching S1-S2-S3 almost non-stop.<br />
<br />
I was skeptical at first to say the least but simply started to watch out of boredom. However, today it hit me that watching Major was probably one of my best decisions ever. The first season was pretty good, but when you get to the last episodes of season 3 you will be watching a complete masterpiece. Episode 24-25 of this season were probably the best two episodes I have ever watched of TV and I have seen over 200 series. Start

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186306">
        Major now and stick with it.. I can promise you it will be worth it.<br />
<br />
If your wondering why I like it then I will state the following:<br />
Art - Majors weakest point is probably their Art its a fairly old anime and hard to compare to animations of 2015 but still desires a 8<br />
<br />
Story - Major&#039;s story is simple but amazing it might not surprise you but it sure as hell will captivate you to watch<br />
<br />
Sound - The sound and music are great not the best but sure as hell top 10.<br />
<br />
Character - You can&#039;t do anything about but love Goro the main character.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - Forgetting time...and watching non-stop to only be beaten by the extreme urge to play a sport...This anime actually fueled me to pick up Tennis again\<br />
<br />
Overall - Only to be out mastered by Shingeki no Kyojin, Death Note and given my 3rd best place of all anime...even pushing aside Kuroko no Basket.<br />
<br />
Do yourself a favor and watch<br />

    I don&#039;t know what was wrong with me but it took me time to watch Major though to be a sport genre anime sport which is my favourite anime genre, and no, it&#039;s not the baseball game, I already learned from Cross Gamer that baseball have great deep playing than tennis soccer or basketball and specifically because of that it is very enjoying sport, it was not also the length of the franchise - the more the anime is long I more love to marathon it, and still I don&#039;t know what kept mo so long to watch Major.<br />
The minute I finally went and get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346287">
        the 1st season episodes I already marathoned the first 4 episodes, the story and the characters just got into me, I couldn&#039;t wait and I watched the whole 1st season in only 2 days, the story (though to be a normal shounen story about kid who wants to be a pro baseball player there&#039;s some twist I will explain later on) the characters development, some of the comedy and the excitement of the baseball build this awesome anime.<br />
This first season of the major anime series is actually containing only 2 arcs of the whole story - the Kindergarten arc and the Little League arc, the studio actually went and split the 2nd arc to two stories - the training sub-arc and the tournament sub-arc by the ending theme, when I first noted that there&#039;s so much arcs in the anime series I thought that how could 26 episodes to contain so much, I was wrong totally.<br />
The episodes of the first arc though to be out of the ordinary - the story isn&#039;t even about Goro but his father, some of those episodes even made me feel i&#039;m watching a movie and not a 20 minutes episodes, though to be more drama episodes than sport episodes, those episodes is what makes Major to be so good - Goro is not going to be just ordinary pro player because he want to, but because his father wants him to live the enjoy of the baseball, this point isn&#039;t dead once the arc is finished but escort Goro to final arc, he don&#039;t play baseball to live it but to enjoy it, that&#039;s all, the way to being pro is not just to win and being the best but to really live up the baseball game.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
like I said the story is split by two arcs, the split isn&#039;t only about being in kindergarten or being able to play in the little league or not, the whole genre is different -  if in the first arc the main character is Goro father Shigearu Honda and his teacher Momoko and their love story, even the few baseball had been seen in this arc is not that serious except the last, the story isn&#039;t just change drastically in the second arc but even have a feeling of another anime series, but the connection is clear as I mentioned.<br />
though couple of episodes in the first arc are quite more melodrama than you except, the anime doesn&#039;t let itself feel the emotions but let the watchers to feel them, unlike the 1st episode of Cross Game that want you to cry with it Major let the emotions out of the box, it&#039;s sound little strange on writing but that really made me feel the pain of the character when needed, even the dialogs aren&#039;t talking about the emotions, the emotions just came out on me.<br />
though I would love more development on some little character, the anime didn&#039;t let much of it but left them untouched, the director or rather the mangaka doesn&#039;t care about them much, they are not the what&#039;s matter and the story should evolve on something else, though to be little cruel I like that a lot - it made the story being clear and smoothy than get stuck on every point in the story.<br />
the second arc on the other hand is completely different, the genre is completely sport &#039;till the end, the goal is clear - while the first sub-arc is about creating a team and training for the tournament the goal of the second sub-arc is actually not about winning the tournament but to beat the Yokohama Little team, the pace and the baseball playing is made well that even the little story about Momoko between the lines isn&#039;t disturbing but actually make a little break episodes.<br />
the training sub-arc on the other hand is much more consecrating on the character development and Goro&#039;s abilities than the games itself, there are some games but they are not that high level as the tournament games.<br />
the story on the tournament sub-arc is consecrating more on the baseball games and the obstacles, though to be some anime materials in some of the obstacles it&#039;s one-time and actually make a good learning for the Dolphins team, in fact once the baseball games is starting the pace of the games is totally well and the depth of the baseball is what makes for me this anime better than Cross Game, Goro is not kami (yet) and the Dolphins team make a good enjoying baseball team.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
While Goro is the basically shounen sport boy character with over-confidence and good skills he is not the best player yet, and his growing over the 1st season is a notable thing, though he have some understandable up and down characteristic the enjoying of baseball learned from his father is leading him in the right way, some of his obstacles on the series were quite excepted but the way he get through them were notable for how well they made, Goro sure hold his main love for baseball for his character and everyone will like him as he is though to be ordinary shounen boy.<br />
his friends on the other hand have some issues, some good and some bad, I don&#039;t want to extend more than needed so I will just say the important things:<br />
Toshi, Goro&#039;s first friend actually make me like hime in some way, the way of he is developed to be good baseball player by the start touching hand of Goro really make him good, though not to be so main and important along the series he sure have a good story.<br />
Komori though feeling like &quot;Toshi replacement for Goro&quot; is actually my favourite character in this season, his characteristic and his smartness really leads him to be a good baseball player and a supportive manufacture in the season.<br />
Sawamura on the other is my least favourite character in the series, even when he changes his attitude he still not that likeable, he feels for me more like the troublesome character than supportive, though in the advanced episodes I got start really pity him he still don&#039;t that good.<br />
My favourite character is to be Shizumi, you can call her the heroine if you want, for me she is the most important character here, not jut her development but how the mangaka wrote here to be essential character to the team and to the story with probably important rule to the follow season, her love for the baseball that developed along the series and her honesty and intentions to be a good player make her to hold the whole team, though Goro to be the supporting pillar of the group Shizumi seems much more important to raise her group moral and to be successfully team and the most of that is mainly because she is a women baseball player she have much more to prove than the others.<br />
Momoko and Goro father&#039;s friend Shigeno though to be a supportive rule in the second arc, have some development of their own, though it&#039;s good to see an adults developments in series that consecrate on kids their development in some times are not that interesting, only in the interesting part they get more show screen and when they does it is well made.<br />
apart from the above there&#039;s a LOT of characters, I only wrote the important and the lead ones in this season, but as for the other characters, like the couch and rivals, I will let who wants to watch this series to enjoy them as I did, except maybe one dummy father...<br />
<br />
Art<br />
it may be the year or it may be the fact that this is a baseball series, but the character designs isn&#039;t that notable, but if there&#039;s something worth noting is the fact that most of the characters designed by their personality. <br />
the animation is very good, especially in the matches, though in the first episodes the baseball field seems quite plain in the important matches the field looks good, and the background aren&#039;t that bad either, in some episodes they quite plain but endurable.<br />
I didn&#039;t like though how they designed some stuff like the cars - every time I saw one in the series even if had lower quality I could see they aren&#039;t that detailed, it may be for once for a while but it still annoying and I don&#039;t want to hang it on the year, I saw better detailed animations in that year in anime, but again, it&#039;s not that important to say it&#039;s effecting the entire series.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
for the OST the series have great moments, I especially liked the OST in the last episodes, though in most episodes the OST isn&#039;t that felt there&#039;s a great one here, as I said above the series don&#039;t get to emotional in the sad parts but let&#039;s the watcher feels them, the OST is directed by it as well.<br />
in the start I really didn&#039;t get the opening but as I sticked to series the song grew on me to be a good baseball anime song.<br />
the ending songs on the other hand are quite different, while the first ending was quite good to second didn&#039;t fitted to me so much, actually, since it came in the late episodes of the season it might be me to not grew so much on it but I still think it&#039;s not fitting so much to the anime, on the contrasty I liked how it came to split between the two sub-arc.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
I will say again what I wrote in the start of this review - I don&#039;t know why it took me so much time to watch Major, once I started it I thought immediately - why I didn&#039;t watched it yet?! the drama, the sport, the comedy, truly one of the best Sport anime there is, I didn&#039;t even thought I will finish it so soon before getting the other seasons, but it was so fun ride I can&#039;t wait.<br />
I will finish with this - if you are a fan of the sport anime genre, what are you waiting for? if not, put it in your PTW and when you have some time, this anime just be for you - the way I see it the first season theme is &quot;enjoying baseball&quot;, I haven&#039;t watched real baseball in my life and it&#039;s not my country main sport anyway, Major take this sport to the most enjoying experience there is.

    Okay, disclaimer, baseball is one of my favorite sports. I never got to play it growing up because I had track and that was in the spring, but it&#039;s one of my favorites. I religiously follow my favorite baseball team in the summer. But that&#039;s not the point of this anime.<br />
<br />
Let me also say that I literally made an account on this thing just to write a review on this masterpiece of an anime. I don&#039;t watch anime that often, I watch it to brush up on my Japanese and get some enjoyment out of it as well. I am Japanese so yeah, I just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206516">
        suck at it but whatever.<br />
<br />
But let me just review this thing. Major is easily my favorite anime of all time. Am I bias? Sure. Absolutely. But it&#039;s not just that I love baseball.<br />
<br />
When I was looking for an anime to watch way back when in middle school, I wanted to watch a sports one. I just finished watching Eyeshield 21 and thought that was a blast. So then middle school me stumbled upon this anime. How many days did it take me to watch its entirety? Well I like bragging so I say 3, but realistically it was around 4-5 days. Honestly I soaked this anime up like a sponge it was a bit concerning looking back.<br />
<br />
But now, I tend to re-watch the entire 154 episode series at least every 1-2 years. I&#039;m in the middle of doing so right now and it&#039;s a blast. I&#039;m finishing this up at a steady pace and it&#039;s once again a bit concerning. I don&#039;t even care though.<br />
<br />
I literally cannot sing enough praise for this anime. The plot twists, the heart-wrenching, the music, the EVERYTHING. I already know what&#039;s gonna happen and I still catch myself intently watching season after season in mere days.<br />
<br />
Sure, there were a few moments I thought was a bit unrealistic/I didn&#039;t like it. But it didn&#039;t even matter. I don&#039;t even know, this is my favorite anime of all time and it&#039;s so underrated. Nobody talks about it but I don&#039;t care.<br />
<br />
I try to get all my friends to watch it but naturally they don&#039;t just because it&#039;s a sports anime. But it&#039;s so much more than that. The character development to me is just crazy. The way the main character, Goro, gets his shit done is just a bit absurd. Sure, to win games it gets a bit dicey and up to luck, but that just adds to the thrill of the show.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s impossible for me to sing enough praise about this show. I literally love it too much. Listening to all the music too, I forgot how badass it all is. If you&#039;re reading reviews debating to watch it or not. Just stop. And just watch it. You won&#039;t regret it, there&#039;s just no way you will.

    &quot;These types of wounds will heal with a little spit.&quot;<br />
<br />
This review is for the entire series.<br />
<br />
Major, to me, is arguably one of the best anime ever created. Its story is truly paralleled by no other. Watching Major is like being gently yet purposefully guided along a path filled with twists, bends, steep inclines, and difficult obstacles, but the experiences along the way will be remembered for the rest of your life. I have a special place in my heart for Honda Gorou, the main character throughout this series. After watching all there is to watch, all 6 seasons, both OVAs, and the movie, I&#039;m left

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236090">
        with an empty, resounding ache that never wants to let Gorou go.<br />
<br />
The story follows the life of Honda Gorou, from his nursery school days in the first season all the way up to his mid-thirties in the final OVA (Major: Message). This first season, from the very first episode, paints a perfect picture to give you a sense of what the entire anime is like.  Baseball is the main theme, yes-- but Major transcends far beyond just an anime about sports. Even as a newbie to baseball, and even though I was unfamiliar with a lot of the baseball terms and game rules, it didn&#039;t hinder my understanding at all. Beyond just baseball, there are several impactfully developed themes that recur throughout the story, the most notable two of which are the values of family and teamwork. Yeah, it sounds so cliche and overdone-- but Major is special in its bitterly honest and emotionally personal portrayal of these values. In the end, it really feels like you yourself have struggled alongside Gorou, and through his experiences, you genuinely become closer to him as you may even learn a thing or two about life.<br />
<br />
The art only gets better with each season, which also has something to do with their air dates. It&#039;s clear, smooth, and well-animated consistently throughout the series. You can get a bit picky with how the direction adult Gorou&#039;s hair is sweeped doesn&#039;t seem to move consistently with his head, but it&#039;s really quite trivial. It&#039;s also notable that most of the female characters look really similar, and some background male characters have poor facial designs, but it didn&#039;t detract too much from the story, personally. The sound is great too: I love all the OSTs and most of the OPs and EDs with the exception of the Season 4 OP. In Major, art and sound are both considered more than just a way to portray the story. They are treated as key components crucial to the story, intertwined in such a way that emotions become heightened and enjoyment is at its maximum potential.<br />
<br />
In the end, I really enjoyed the story of Major, and the tremendous character growth of not only Gorou, but all of those around him who all face their own issues. They manage to overcome them with help from their own strength, but ultimately and mainly with inspiration from Gorou&#039;s warrior spirit. I honestly feel personally connected with Gorou. Throughout all 6 seasons, 2 OVAs, and the movie, I found myself cheering for him in times of adversity, crying with him in times of despair, and laughing with him in times of joy. He&#039;s become like a genuine friend who I truly care for. His charismatic passion for not just baseball, but also towards family, purposeful teamwork, and many other life values have marked a special spot in my heart that I will never forget.

    I can&#039;t believe I haven&#039;t stumbled upon this anime until 2018 ... I confess I&#039;ve seen all of it in less than a month and OMG it was sooo good.<br />
The word underrated was made exactly to define this anime... I just finished watching it and I can&#039;t quite put it into words the feeling that this left me . It was so good, the fact that you can follow up the MCs life from the age of 5 until hes a full grown up it is absolutely amazing. <br />
The way the story is told is a masterpiece. <br />
This anime takes you trough a rollercoster of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277149">
        feeling , from crying to cheering. All I can say it is the perfect anime for my taste. I would 10/10 recommend this to any of my friends

    &quot;Never judge a book by its cover.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a saying everyone should live by. I for one have always ended up judging several anime based on what the cover looks like, but Major is one I am glad that I have given a try. It may shy away some people because it&#039;s a sports anime, but it teaches so much more and was a great watch! I cannot believe that it is this underrated and such a gem. Everyone should give this series a try.<br />
<br />
I wish I could have written a better review, but please bear with me as this is my first. I just

    Here&#039;s the deal with Major. Despite its length and despite your opinion on baseball, its awesome. Watch it.<br />
<br />
Major is a simple, but well-thought out story following Goro Shigeno as he journeys through life with baseball. The story is what you&#039;d find in many sports anime/movies; try hard enough and succeed. Major pulls this concept off so well that it never feels stale, and includes some very good, unexpected plot twists, especially later on. <br />
<br />
The place where Major shines most is the characters. Everyone is so interesting and well-developed, including back stories and front stories. They have very unique personalities with multitudes of reasons as why

          <span style="display: none;" id="review42641">
        they play baseball. Over the course of the 6 seasons, everyone grows literally, and in characters, from child to adult. Its refreshing to see where they go with their lives after each season.<br />
<br />
Sound and art are good. Everything looks as it should and sounds as it should. Voicing is very well done and believable. The art also well done. Scenes that are meant to look intense are given extra detail and Shigeno&#039;s fastest pitches are drawn, showing off that speed. You can feel how fast he pitches many times. The only gripe I have is that they re-use his pitching animation a lot. I understand pitches have a certain form they never break from (as a basketball player, I know this), but it would&#039;ve been nice to see more variety in how they animated his pitches while showing his same pitching form. Also, sometimes the lively, cheering fans can look pretty stoic despite a major homerun. Otherwise, everything is very good.<br />
<br />
All in all, Major is a must-see for sports fans. Its well-done and a great pleasure to watch. Regardless of your opinion of baseball (I&#039;ve never liked baseball in the past), there&#039;s so much to take away. Great characters, great story, an overall fun time. 154 episodes, one movie and one OVA sounds rather daunting, but I can say this; Major will have you hooked from very first fastball.

    Major Season 1 is a definite gem of a series. Although I&#039;m not to big on sports anime I must admit that the story can&#039;t help but grab your attention with it&#039;s hard hitting drama (no pun intended). The character&#039;s feel realistic and charming; so much so, that you are completely drawn in to their development. Especially Goro, the main character. For the baseball aspect of the series you definitely won&#039;t be disappointed. There is a great amount of on the field action to keep you on the edge of your seat. The only drawback I can say is that the animation could of been

    definitely worth a look, binged the series in a whole day and it brought me to tears at least 3-4 time. The first thing that caught my eye was the plot/storyline, just something intriguing and giving you the feeling of &#039;oh my, what&#039;s next&#039; Secondly the characters! Probably one of the best protagonists you can have, Hasn&#039;t frustrated me once and have made me cry a few times. Hopefully, this review can give you a little insight of the anime, this is lowkey my first ever review online so I was lost for words at the number of times I saw &#039;not enough words&#039;

    Baseball. It has alot of mixed reviews when it comes to sports, but its just sports and its always amazing when you see someone give it all they have for the love of it.<br />
Thats all this anime is about, they did milk it a bit though, Goro with a upbringing of the sport hardwired to inspire his surrounging friends with uncomprimising determination.<br />
<br />
Overall I would rank this 8/10, better than Prince of Tennis. (Not because its better, only because they reaaalllly dragged that one out).

    Where do I start... this shows had risen so many emotions that I don&#039;t even know what would be the best part to start with.<br />
<br />
Well for starters I defiantly enjoyed it far more than I expected. I didn&#039;t have any high hopes for it and had delayed the watch for a quiet a while but now that I&#039;m done, I&#039;m really excited to check other seasons.<br />

Even though the main topic is baseball, it still covers a lot of other themes such as family, death, dreams, hope, determination, friendship, bullying... such great variety! I barely know any other good shows that have so much covered. Besides

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47733">
        a lot of this stuff seems pretty realistic.<br />
<br />
The episodes seem to last longer than they actually are, and no, it is not because it is dragging. The reason is because one single episode manages to cover that much content. Some popular shows such as Bleach really should learn from it.<br />
<br />
It was a long time that I got engaged in anime, lately everything seems to be medicore and my scores started to get 7 or below when it used to be 8 and above. Yep, I became picky.<br />
<br />
The biggest part of characters are also enjoyable and the main cast gets well developed towards the end.<br />
<br />
Possible spoilers up ahead!<br />
Originally I planned to give this show 9 but... just as many other shows, the outcome at the end was predictable. The worst part is that show actually tried to flash out some rivals by giving them goal and dream but sadly only main cast got their dreams realized. No matter how much opponent tried, they were destined to lose and I find it beyond unfair! After having such great improvement and game, I see no problem as to why the main team couldn&#039;t lose at least once and let someone else to reach their dream.<br />
<br />
Besides Goro was created as too much of a hero to my liking, especially in the last episode.<br />
<br />
Another thing that ticked me off was the attitude of some characters, Goro&#039;s included. However, it did&#039;t effect my score.<br />
There are those who give up without trying what really makes you tick and then there is Goro who never gives up even when his future and health is put in danger. As a sportist who got many injuries which had delayed my progress if not totally ruined my dreams (I still have time and hope!), I really can&#039;t relate with Goro&#039;s stubbornness. My hands were itching several times. He might say all these cool stuff now but if he were to get injured for real as his father, he would 100% sing another song. It is good that he wants to support his team and continue to play with them but once you get a life time injury, all of that can instantly get crashed... You have to think about future at least some times.
