    Seems like a big cashgrab to me, glad I didn&#039;t pay to go to the cinema for this Movie. <br />
<br />
It felt like their Budget on Animation was just as much on this 1:40h Movie as on a normal 20 Min episode of One-Piece. The animations are horrendous and PC 3D animations are used waaaay to often, they didn&#039;t care animating many scenes. About 40% of this movie is made in some 3D software and not Animated. Very disappointing concidering Cinema movies rack in way more money than just a single episode.<br />
<br />
The character Bullet also seems like a cool idea also coming off of GolD Rogers

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342622">
        ship but his backstory and especially his Devilfruit concept are very bad and just made to be over the top. And on top of that he looks very bad in the Anime only being animated in 3D....<br />
<br />
Consistency to the Main story is also close to None, for example with Luffy being able to Use Gear 4 Multiple times within 5 Minutes. Oh and dont even get me starten on the &quot;King King King Kong Gun&quot; or whatever it was.<br />
<br />
All in all there are some enjoyable moments (Sabo and Ace Fire Fist in the end) but all the bad aspects of the movie push me to beg you to not support this movie in any way shape of form. Dont buy the CD, dont buy Figures of this movie etc. We have to choose what we want and we definetly dont want trashy 3D animations. Vote with your wallet and show them we want something better.  I get it&#039;s just a filler but they probably spent more money advertising the movie than actually making it.

    Though I had high hopes for this one, unfortunately it turned out to be quite horrible. Brainless plot, abrupt start &amp; ending, bad use of characters, no heartfelt incidents, no meaningful turning points, dialogs that made me facepalm myself and so, so many coincidences throughout this movie. So many coincidences it&#039;s actually ridiculous. For instance, they are all on a huge freaking island and they just keep &#039;stumbling across&#039; one another at the right moment. Nevertheless, the thing that ticked me off the most was that I found 0% funny scenes. Seriously, even One Piece Movie 6 had more humor and its basically a psychological

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334490">
        thriller.<br />
<br />
It seemed more like a really long One Piece commercial that a movie. &quot;Oh, look! We have all those cool characters in our anime. Come and watch it.&quot; I mean they introduce a person like Bullet and he does absolutely nothing other than shout &quot;I strive to be the strongest!&quot; Sooo original! In addition, how he enters the scene is boring enough to revert your eyes from the screen. An otherwise stressful moment of Usopp being hurt by this insanely strong enemy, was ruined when it was not shown properly so that the viewer will feel fear or compassion for this long-nosed character. <br />
<br />
Fight animation wise it was... decent. A few fight scenes looked quite silly, but those were few and far apart. The final battle though was just awful. It was fairly alright until Bullet decided to go full Mechagodzilla style which, in my humble opinion, destroyed my already low interest in this movie.<br />
<br />
This film could have had SO much potential (and I can&#039;t emphasize this enough!) due to the festival setting and the story of one of Roger&#039;s former crew-mates, but they managed to ruin it and create a &quot;stampede&quot; of already well known characters who begged for screen time and nothing more. Maybe this story required 2 parts and more time to do it correctly.<br />
<br />
And all the aforementioned come from an One Piece fan that loves it since grade school. I do not know why I still keep watching this anime. Maybe it&#039;s the nostalgia, the need to know the ending or maybe just to see some random adventure of this crew. Whatever the reason, I always hope for at least a decent plot and not some unreasonable fights with gibberish dialogs like in this movie. But, alas, our beloved One Piece has already become another victim of exploitation and exists for the sole purpose of selling merchandise, video games and plot-less films. It&#039;s a shame...

    I saw this movie in Japan with one of my friends a few days after it released, so I&#039;ll throw in my 2 cents.<br />
<br />
I want to preface this review by saying, if you&#039;re not already a die-hard One Piece fan, this movie has next to nothing for you.<br />
<br />
Despite my fairly limited Japanese ability, I was able to comprehend the entire plot and the vast majority of the dialogue, (maybe to an extent of about 90% or so). I think the reason being is that this movie has barely any substance. When the movie starts we&#039;re introduced to the island and then the &quot;first event&quot; starts.<br />
Shortly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317421">
        after the battle begins the movie devolves into &quot;oh hey look it&#039;s [insert one piece character here]&quot; that character does an attack or something and then we get another character show up and the same thing happens all the way till the end of the movie.<br />
I kept expecting some hint of story to be mentioned but it never really happened, aside from a few short moments.<br />
The villain is highly forgettable and leaves no real lasting impression, even writing this review I was struggling to even remember his name, despite being able to remember the Z and Gold villains easily, despite having seen those movies a much longer time ago.<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t to say that the movie is bad, if you&#039;re a die-hard One Piece fan you will find enjoyment in this movie. The battle is enjoyable, the animation is good and the soundtrack just adds to the excitement.<br />
But I think the lack of a decent story and over-reliance on fan service really brings the movie down.<br />
<br />
For me I think the movie would sit at a 5 or 6. It&#039;s better than average and I enjoyed watching it, but I would be in no great hurry to run out and watch it again. And if you&#039;re eagerly awaiting the western release, and expecting anything more than fan service I recommend you lower your expectations to get more out of seeing this movie.<br />
<br />
TL;DR The movie is severely held-back by it&#039;s lack of narrative, over-reliance on fan service and rushed pacing. Lower your expectations before watching to get the most enjoyment from this film.

    One Piece Stampede<br />

As an avid One Piece fan I was blown away by how great the movie was. Every second was pure fun and this is hands-down one of my favorite movie of all time. Mind-blowing. <br />
<br />
Best One Piece Movie after Film Z (out of 14) <br />

Synopsis: <br />
Follow the strawhats as they get invited to the large event known as pirate expo! All star pirates are gathered in the pirate expo, the marines decide to interfere, what conspires in this event? A One Piece spin off movie.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
Amazing plot!<br />
It really follows

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317801">
        the synopsis. Oda-sensei did another something amazing! 👀 &lt;no spoilers&gt; <br />
The plot was too good while watching the movie. Watch it from 0(hr):00(min) to 1(hr):51(mins). <br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
Don&#039;t skip any second especially the post credits-scene where people usually skip when watching anime 😂 <br />
There seems to be a big clue or mystery that can be a hint in the future of One Piece<br />
<br />
Characters/Casts: 10/10<br />
ALL-STAR!! MIND BLOWING!! AMAZING!!<br />
I&#039;m out of words for this 😂 it was nice seeing old casts gather together here ❤ (how did  they gather those casts together here?) how nostalgic! <br />
<br />
Soundtrack/Sound effects: 10/10<br />
Soundtracks and effects fit in at the right time especially in fight scenes!<br />
<br />
GONG - WANIMA should be the next One Piece Opening Soundtrack!<br />

Animation: 11/10<br />
INSANE! AMAZING!<br />
Didn&#039;t expect &quot;TOEI Animation&quot; could bring an animation like this after watching STAMPEDE.<br />
Full of action and fight scenes.<br />
Clap<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 11/10<br />
I missed the comedy scenes in today&#039;s ONE PIECE especially the pre time-skip comedy scenes during the old days but they brought it back to the movie 😂<br />
Every second was pure fun and full of memories. You won&#039;t be disappointed. :) <br />
Nostalgic ONE PIECE <br />
<br />
ONE PIECE is really a big part of my life. ❤<br />
<br />
I want to watch it again and again.<br />

    I have watched multiple time all the 14 One piece movie so far. This one for me will be ranked probably number one or number two (Strong World is truly hard to beat, but this one was also really power-full to me).<br />
<br />
Sadely I had to watched it in VO because I&#039;m currently living in Japan (but I&#039;m not a native speaker).<br />
<br />
I think I will wait one or two years... *sad laughed*... to watch it in &quot;VOSTFR&quot; to say if its number one or two of the One Piece franchise.<br />
( ☉̅ 益 ☉̅ )<br />
<br />
Its kind a weird because the only issues I can find in this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315593">
        movies are related to the antagonist. I can&#039;t say much without spoiling so I will clause my mouse about it, but that strange cause often there are well made in One Piece. Not this time I guess, but the rest was EPIC!<br />
<br />
If you like One Piece, I think you will love-it! ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ<br />
<br />
PS: In my opinion, you should finish reading or watching &quot;Dresrosa Arc&quot; before considering to watched-it. •ᴗ•<br />
<br />
¯_(ツ)_/¯ Sorry if my English was bad, I&#039;m not an English native speaker.

    I was wondering if there could be a One Piece Movie worse than One Piece Gold ... well, i was not disappointed ... :P<br />
<br />
Story: Yeah, they just wanted Godzilla type villain in One Piece, maybe.. I think Oda shd stop writing these movies ..i, sometimes, doubt his ability...because he is the guy who wrote such an awesome manga One Piece.. but when itc omes to movies especially the latest two (I have no problem with Z or Strong World (even though i dont like Nami))..Oda...well, creates a mess. <br />
<br />
Art and Sound were good. no complaints there.<br />
<br />
Character: Well, Characters were boring. there was no emphasis on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343862">
        them anyway ..maybe because there were too many .. Being One Piece fan, i prefer Straw Hats not some marines or revolutionary army or CP0-9....Not a fan of Sabo or Lucci , sorry..Smoker is starting to get annoying tbh, especially his hypocrisy .. -_- .. i hope dont get to see him in One Piece anime for a long time...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I was hoping that i would enjoy ..but i didnt ... experience was even worse than watching Gold...-_-<br />
<br />
Overall: Waste of time !!<br />

    Warning – this review might have some spoilers; you have been warned.<br />
<br />
One Piece is one of those franchises that is known to have produced many movies and specials over the years to make a quick buck since the series is so massive and popular, and oftentimes, those movies are either a hit or miss. Those movies can range from really good to absolute dog shit in terms of quality, luckily for us One Piece fans, this movie is not dog shit. Stampede is the latest movie to have come out as of writing this review, and thankfully, the gods have blessed us with good fortune

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337554">
        as the movie has turned out quite well. Now that I’ve ticked this off from the dozens of One Piece items on my list, I’ll go into detail explaining why this movie is one of the best One Piece films to have been released to date.<br />
<br />
Before I get to the positive aspects of the film, I would say that the plot is probably one of the film’s biggest letdowns. The movie follows the Straw Hats and nearly everybody else as they all set out to partake in a festival just for pirates, a banquet of sorts and everyone is enjoying themselves. The festival is located on an island and is kept hidden from the marines. One of the events of the festival is a treasure hunt, and it turns out that the treasure everyone is hunting for can lead them straight to the one and only treasure that is One Piece. They have a massive battle with a previously unknown enemy who’s overpowered as shit, yada yada yada, Luffy defeats the enemy and saves the day, the end. The plot is actually very similar to a lot of the previous films, especially Gold, so when reflecting on the story of the film, I’m a bit disappointed the writers couldn’t think of something completely different, though it might be because it is One Piece and you can only do so much with pirates as the theme. I don’t think the story isn’t too bad, though it might be a bit rushed as well, if they did an overhaul of the writing and the story, the movie would be a whole lot better.<br />
<br />
One of the things that keeps this movie afloat is probably the fan service with the amount of characters they’ve thrown in, as most of the pirates make an appearance. It was fun seeing them come together and fight among/work with each other, the film does feature Buggy and his crew quite a bit, which I have no complaints with. We are introduced to the villain, a former crew member of Blackbeard’s crew, and one of the prisoners who’s escaped from level 6 of Impel Down. He actually adds quite a bit of information to what we already know about Blackbeard and his crew since we know only a little about them, which adds to the lore of the One Piece world. Though he does present a challenge to the pirates and the navy, and since his powers were cool to see, he is a cookie-cutter villain. In terms of tragic backstory that sets him down the path of greed, evil and revenge, he is the same as Tesoro from One Piece Film: Gold. Overall, I think the characters were implemented quite well and their character dynamics were fun to watch, there were loads of gags and Easter eggs scattered around the film and the rest of the cast were good, nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Where the film excelled the most is probably the animation and artwork, I think Toei pulled out all of the stops to create something that looks amazing. Just like the previous One Piece films, Stampede is well animated and has great artwork. Since we’re all used to the weekly half-a-chapter episodes, any One Piece content that has some sort of budget and time &amp; effort put into it will look good. Fluid animation and the artwork for the films will always be on the plus side with the films. They decided to rely more on the CG, which had it’s up and downs throughout the film; on the downside, stuff like the transformation scene, most of the giant monster scenes, and the tiny background characters looked out of place and weird, and it was a little bit off-putting, though the CG monster was used well alongside the 2D animation in most instances. The cinematography was really well done as well, whether it be the camera movement around the character’s body or the panning and zooming into characters, you will be impressed by how well they made use of the camera motion. Out of all the films, I enjoyed watching the fight scenes here the most. The Luffy vs Bullet fight is one of the better fights out of all the One Piece films, and probably in my top 5-10 fights in all of One Piece. Overall, the animation and art was great.<br />
<br />
Production-wise, the soundtrack, the sound effects, the voice acting, and the ending song were good and did their jobs well. We get an original ending song just for the film, which is sung by WANIMA, which closes off and wraps up the movie nicely. The OSTs did their jobs in evoking emotional responses for the viewers, be it emotional music for the sad and depressing scenes or the fun and exciting music for the introduction or the hype and intense music for the fight scenes; the music was implemented quite well. I felt as if the sound effects were a bit better than usual, not that repetitive and bland sound effects that are played on repeat when characters do repetitive attacks (like clanging of swords) you’d see in the main series. For a movie based on festivities and fighting, the music is a positive aspect and is something that should be accredited for.<br />
<br />
Compared to the other films, I enjoyed this a whole lot more. This is pure fan service for anyone who’s invested in the series and/or is up to date with the latest episode like I am. If you like to see fighting accompanied with excellent animation, and if you’re a fan of One Piece, then definitely check out this film. Even with it’s flaws, out of all of the One Piece films I’ve watched so far, this is probably one of the best out of the lot.<br />
<br />
Overall score: 8/10

    Stampede is a One Piece movie that is an outstanding example of how to utilize it being &quot;non-canon&quot; to the fullest. So you can get much out of the film without coming out feeling a sense of disappointment. It&#039;s a passionate love letter to all the fans worldwide, and a damn well written on at that gets the point across and then some. Toei went all out with this movie and pulled out all stops to get everyone&#039;s attention right from the getgo. There is not a single moment in the film that I would consider dull or slow in any way. More or less,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320726">
        everything is high paced, and you are continually being hit by amazing spectacles one after another. It&#039;s gorgeous, both artistically and animation-wise. It is one the most eye-candy experience you will get out of any One Piece movie thus far. There is a fair use of CGI in there as well, but it was nothing short of top-notch, and I have nothing to pick on as expected. One simple and straightforward way to describe Stampede would be its equivalence to Avengers: End Game but personally for me a whole lot more gratifying, exhilarating, and engaging all-around.<br />
<br />
There are in total of three movies (four now), which are considered the top dogs of One Piece film. All excel at especially one category one way or the other. Starting with Strong World, which has both a good plot and lots of slice of life elements to elevate the experience further. Shiki is a gripping villain, to put it bluntly. Then moving on to Film Z, it has, by far, in my opinion, the best story depiction with a better-written enemy. Even surpassing the likes of Stampede&#039;s Bullet or Shiki from Strong World if you ask me. Don&#039;t get me wrong here, though. I am talking in the sense of which movie utilized the potential better with the respective character. Finally, there is Gold that has some of the best slice of life elements among any One Piece movie to date. Not to mention, most interactions between the straw hats. Tesoro is not the best final boss. But Toei did a good one making us feel bad or pity Tesoro through short sequences of flashbacks.<br />
<br />
When it comes to Stampede, on the other hand, it excels at the breathtaking non-stop action sequences. Filled to the brim with a pop of colorful movements with a lot of spice in ridiculously many ways. One of which happens to be an absurd amount of character they threw at us in this movie. Mostly all your favorites make a comeback, enemies, and allies alike. You can even see non-canon figures from other movies make a slight appearance. It&#039;s genuinely marvelous Toei, and Oda was able to accomplish so much with a mere two hours to work with. It&#039;s without a shadow of a doubt a movie focused on the fanservice above the narrative aspects, and it&#039;s done in an absolutely fantastic manner. In which case, the overall story or rather the main villain Bullet is one of the weaker parts of the movie in that way. He is absurdly powerful and impressive in any other way. However, his character is weakly constructed and could&#039;ve been much more thoroughly fleshed out.<br />
<br />
That said, don&#039;t get me wrong. I absolutely enjoyed all the fights centering around this guy, but I wanted more out of him as a person too. On another note: the pacing, of course, is fast, and I would not really consider this a downside since it&#039;s to be expected with a limited run-time. Of course, I would love to see more interactions between returning cast members just as much as the next guy. So it does suck we didn&#039;t get much screen time for many of them as one would&#039;ve liked. However, in some way or manner, each character had some screen-time, even if it was not as lengthy, but still packed a powerful blow of impact filled with tasty spice. But I will also not let that take away all the other fun I had from watching this incredible movie. For instance, the canon stuff Oda implanted in the film was a tasty spoon of information and gave us One Piece fans new things to speculate on as a result. Not the most extensive in terms of information but something that matters in the grand scheme of things. I am sure us One Piece fans know a way or two to make few signs into a massive pool of predictions and theories. I have no doubt we will be able to make the most use without much trouble.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, you get to relive one of the core things that makes One Piece such an entertaining and lively experience. All of the characters among so much else. So, in all honesty, I personally am not disappointed and was utterly thrilled. I had the time of my life watching this movie. It&#039;s definitely something I am going to be watching every now and then for sure. On top of that, it&#039;s without a shadow of a doubt, my favorite One Piece movie to date. I won&#039;t lie; I am biased by saying this. But this takes the top spot for all anime movies for me. As One Piece fan, I couldn&#039;t be happier about Stampede even if I tried. It&#039;s unquestionably the perfect movie that takes the non-canon element and goes crazy with it in many extraordinary and creative ways. One more thing I want to add. Please don&#039;t watch this movie unless you are fully caught up to One Piece anime or manga. It&#039;s a lore bomb and the only people who will genuinely be able to appreciate this movie. Will be those who have gone through either the One Piece anime or manga already.<br />
<br />
Moreover, it&#039;s filled with spoilers you might rather avoid. Trust me. Some of the things in here you would love to have experienced through the main story. So, in a nutshell, if you are a hardcore One Piece fan, you will absolutely fall in love with this movie. If you are out for a solid story and lots of character depth, then you might find yourself slightly disappointed here. But please don&#039;t look at it negatively, or that&#039;s what you will see. Instead, immerse yourself in everything that makes One Piece phenomenal all at once, and enjoy the excitement it brings to you. Let&#039;s also not forget this movie commemorates the 20th anniversary of One Piece anime. It&#039;s a full-blown fanservice movie and a breathtaking one at that. I have nothing but praises for Toei and our one and only Oda for producing such a high-packed action movie. Delivers in all the right categories and goes above beyond to give the viewer a completely satisfying and thrilling experience.

    [ First of all, this movie is NOT canon. Meaning that it won&#039;t affect the real story because it doesn&#039;t actually occur in the actual timeline. ]<br />
<br />
When One Piece makes a non-canon movie. You know that they&#039;re trying to flex their budget. The movies are mostly centered around high quality actions/fighting that would probably make any tryhard One Piece fan with Nami/Robin body pillow go speechless.<br />
<br />
Because it&#039;s non-canon. The story section becomes irrelevant and the movies turns out to be more centered towards pure action powered by the budget of the studio and the amount of fan-service they add into the movies. <br />
<br />
One Piece Movie

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326425">
        14: Stampede blew my mind away with its fine quality and art style. Seeing the fight scenes full of fan-service. It feels so nostalgic that I sensed the strong feeling of &quot;I&#039;m back&quot; although I am already caught up with the One Piece series. <br />
<br />
This movie was awesome like every other movies of One Piece. It feels nostalgic to see something like this once in a while. Really brings back memories from when I was a kid. <br />
<br />
I recommend this to all One Piece fans. You must watch it for the juice yo.

    Alright, shonen battle movies are typically pretty garbage. This is not a good movie, but for One Piece fans, this has really good fanservice. The story is fairly garbage, but that&#039;s to be expected from shonen battle movies. The animation is either pretty darn good, or PS2 level CGI; it&#039;s mediocre. The music slaps, bringing the OG One Piece theme in to get us hyped. The best part, hands down, is the characters. One Piece has so many fun and great characters, and they come in droves in this movie. It might seem like cheap fanservice at first, but they all get their spotlight, making

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320615">
        it feel natural when they&#039;re introduced. <br />
Also the villain is garbage as well. <br />
a 7 score may seem confusing considering how much I&#039;m ripping on this movie, but it really was a fun watch. It has so many great character moments it makes it all worth it.

    This movie was perfect. One Piece Movie 14: Stampede has perfect quality and art style. This movie was awesome like every other movies of One Piece. Seeing the fight scenes is so good. The animation was fantastic as usual. And every One Piece fans dream so many old characters are coming in this movie. Like Smoker, like Rob Lucci. I liked that the movie introduced a lot of characters. Lastly I love one thing so much. The clash of King&#039;s Haki. It was perfect.<br />
<br />
If you fan One Piece, you should watch this movie. This movie is just insane. I recommend this to all One Piece

    One of the best parts of One-piece movies is that we get screen time for characters. Now while it may seem preposterous in a1000-chapter story, there are simply so many things in this world that there isn&#039;t enough time to explore all these pieces in the story. And while Movies are usually non-canon, it sometimes feels good to see the straw hats just interact, as weird as that seems. They make Franky&#039;s SUPERS feel nostalgic, use the powerups and abilities they have but never use, and add that lighthearted feel we miss post-time skip, of them just being a family. And adding character development in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373962">
        a non-cannon movie with lots of fun cements this movie as excellent, even if one or two things are lacking in the film.<br />
<br />
This movie&#039;s plot is nothing special and is driven purely by the crazy antics of the One-Piece world. Taking place after whole cake island and right before Wano (While still having all the crewmates and supernovast here), the development is around that area, while the people involved are slight plot holes. Drawn to take part in a pirate treasure hunt organized by the late Gol D. Roger, hundreds of pirates go to this pirate resort and look for this legendary treasure said to be Gol D. Rogers legacy. It becomes an exclusive pirate festival containing all the big names that will include mindless fun and battles. However, upon arriving, the straw hats find Law injured and realize that something is happening behind the scenes.<br />
<br />
Now one of the best parts of the movie is that the world is more fleshed out. Due to the One-piece world&#039;s enormity, each island is almost a different world as Oda shows everything the world holds, while still being limited to arcs no longer than 100 chapters post time skip. So, Oda uses movies like One piece Stampede and film Z to accentuate and show the small details like the knock-up stream and leaves others like film gold to flesh out the world and its characters. The film has constant throwbacks like the knock-upstream, the bubbles from Sabaody/Fishman island, and the small bits of charm in the grand line; it makes the world feel lived in.  Using Buster Calls, talk of impel down, marine meetings, and characters we only saw pre-timeskip, it mixes nostalgia with intrigue, as the world just seems bigger, even if the island is a mix of ideas from other islands. We see figures like the warlords and the revolutionary army appear, showing that they still exist. Even Cipher pol 0, organizations we know exist, but want to see more action on. The movie helps build one Piece as a setting we know, rather than the literal planet it is, where millions of things happen in the manga.<br />
<br />
However, despite the worldbuilding and strengthening, the movie&#039;s best part is that the studio seems to care so much. By canonizing the panda man marine captain, and the panda man pirate, it has that small hint, that makes it feel like Oda’d playfull writing. It adds small hints that most anime or movies would not  include, adding TO the manga, instead of the other way around (like the &quot;if I go to this island, I will die disease&quot;). The fights and scenes were also not extended like regular One-Piece anime, as they used every minute of the movie for more action. It showcased moves like Zoro&#039;s tiger hunt, Luffy&#039;s Snakeman, and even Brook&#039;s spirit levitation, making a movie that felt like the director saw and liked the source material. And another component that made the fights was that the fights were not just mindless Sakuya, but Sakuya that fit in with One-Piece and had a purpose outside of a cool fight scene. Unlike most other movies that will Boost their protagonist&#039;s powers tenfold (Which one piece stampede did only a tiny bit) and make up powers, it took the same abilities and used them in the ways we always wanted them to be used in. Zoro had a fight that was not a 1 hit KO like usual, Luffy&#039;s fights had so much choreography, and each of the characters used their abilities in ways that were reminiscent of one-time abilities. And while having the main villain be a Level 6 attendee of impel down that was on Gol D. Rogers ship, almost beat a buster-call, stronger than multiple vice admirals, AND was an awakened devil fruit user THAT had mastered armament and conqueror&#039;s Haki, was a bit &quot;extra”, it was mostly his ideals thhat helped the show, as he was the trigger for Usopps development. <br />
<br />
The MVP of the show was hands down Usopp. I would never expect a movie to contain such good character development for a character, let alone a straw hat, but it did it amazingly. As portrayed in the cannon of the series, Usopp is a coward who is always fine running away when it comes to his safety, knowing that he isn&#039;t on the same level as Sanji or Zoro. But when it comes to the safety of his crew, or others, he stands up. Throughout the movie, there is scene after scene of Ussop trying to save his captain and continually being destroyed, blaming himself for being weak. He almost transforms into the brave warrior he wants to be, as he acts as the captain&#039;s right-hand man, ignoring his own state and helping Luffy in some fantastic scenes (I can&#039;t do it justice, but it is actually excellent). Usopp shines close to the level of water seven, as the movie can also be interpreted as his story. <br />
<br />
Using the movie as an excuse, it brings us screen time of characters such as Sabo, Boa, Smoker, Law, the supernovas, and even others, knowing that One-piece fans were eagerly looking forward to seeing them again. They each get small segments to star in and bring their characters&#039; traits with them, not being eye candy for the fans, but the characters we know and love. While they aren&#039;t main characters or all have major fights, they get plenty of time to interact with each other and solidify individual bonds, connections, and ideas we had about them. They each act as we expected, but even better, as the few chapters spent with them kept an air of mystery that made us want to see more of the characters. Even the Straw Hats, given over 1000 chapters to develop, develop in this show, as we see them plainly interacting. While Oda will put chapters of them interacting occasionally, but they are few and far between, the plot taking charge. So just seeing the straw hats goof off and interacting without a heavy plot leading their conversations and locations just helps make it feel great. <br />
<br />
The animation and the music in the movie were the best One-Piece had to offer. Using the Wano arc animation and condensing it down into a1h 30m movie (and adapting more than 10 PAGES per episode), the movie felt almost as good as the manga.  And while the main villain did turn into a giant CG monster, the CG looked decent, as it was used with a good budget. With animation, fights, and pacing on par with the manga, it finally lived up to One Piece and all it can offer. Even the music, which is usually sub-par, does a decent job, matching the scenes perfectly, and feels amazing. It way outdoes the anime and gets up close with the manga.<br />
<br />
 Now as good as the movie was, it was not without fault. The Characters involved were plot conveniences, as they all took part in the pirate festival. In the anime, the Straw Hats would be split in Wano and WCI, the supernovas either in Wano, Reverie, or on a sky island, and the marines(spoilers) on the warlord&#039;s territory at war with them. There is also the fact that there was an eternal log pose to laugh tale, one small fact I didn&#039;t like. With the path to one Piece revealed to be something entirely different and more interesting, I didn&#039;t particularly appreciate that it was included. Still, it was dealt with in a fine way, ending up a minor annoyance at the end. And even not being a guy who cares about power scaling, the fact that Luffy beat someone &quot;On par with Raleigh&quot; was also a bit weird, as we keep learning more powers they have, and that Luffy should not be able to damage them due to certain things we learn later.  But the movie&#039;s positive points shine bright enough so that they only feel like minor annoyances in the moments they happen, as they were mostly small technical points, rather than larger encompassing problems. Overall, it is a must-watch for a One-Piece fan. While manga readers watch the movies and are always disappointed in some fashion, it wasn&#039;t the case with this movie and felt amazing. And to the anime watchers who chug along at a subpar adaptation, they will love it. One-piece stampede does its job extremely well and feels cannon. With multiple feels, good animation, good pacing, and being the definition of &quot;fun,&quot; It will keep your attention throughout the movie 100%. And while there are small parts that seem weird, its positives way outweighs those, making it one of the best movie experiences ever.<br />

One Piece: Stampede is the 14th movie of the long-running One Piece franchise. Which follows Luffy, a pirate who wants to become the strongest pirate in the world, along with his crew, the straw hat. In this movie, the main antagonists are Mr. I work out a lot and a creepy circus dude. The creepy circus dude is holding an event where pirates gather together to try and find the treasure of Gold D Roger. Which piques the interest of Luffy and his crew. So they attend the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318531">
        event, along with many other fan-favorite characters.<br />
<br />
So you might be wondering what this show does that makes it stand out from all the other One Piece movies. To be frank, if you don&#039;t count the above-average animation at the end then nothing at all. It&#039;s exactly like any other One Piece movie, robots and all. Just a simple punching fight until the main antagonist uses a BFR (Big Fucking Robot) to try and destroy everyone. Which is one of my main gripes. The fistfight at first makes it truly feel like the enemy is really strong and is a treat. But after he turns into a robot it just seems clucky. It makes the fierce fighting at the start turn into a funny fight with a weird looking robot. But other than that I do enjoy the side characters which are fan favorites.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
If you enjoy the other One Piece movies then you would also enjoy this one. Though, if you didn&#039;t enjoy the ones before then this one wouldn&#039;t change your opinion. Overall decent movie with good fan-service. Nothing ground-breaking but not bad at all

    Non-spoiler review for Stampede. First, I recently read &quot;Everything GREAT About Godzilla King of the Monsters! &quot; quote from tomato &quot;flashy cgi is not replacement for good story&quot;. To which I think this is the kind of people who watch pixar movie and think Pixar formula is a genre that have to be applied to all animated movie. Aint need that to see characters beating each other in glorious Wano animation. But I digress<br />
<br />
Story 7<br />
I told you I dont care about the story but I still have to tell you. Pirates gather up in 1 place for supposed Roger-related treasure, following that various faction also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318385">
        blend in for their own agenda.<br />
Right off the bat there are 2 problems with the plot, even disregarding this being a movie. And no, swarming up for nonsense is what these characters do in OP so this fits well. Movies usually slipped/took place in middle of arc but this one have Luffy at 1.5b AND the crew already gather up and the Supernovas are intact. There is few story other than the initial race to treasure hunt and then we are left with each faction reaction against the villain next reveal. I guess that is still engaging instead of the usual exploration/adventure.<br />
<br />
Characters 9<br />
 In this movie the characters are on characters, thankfully no one act exaggerated (unlike that 1 horror OP movie). This is why people seek movie, OVA, spinnoff and doujinshi:  you would imagine &quot;this is what a character would do if they were in this situation&quot;.<br />
 The main villain is bullet, his background is bring up at 3/4 mark of the movie. It justify why such a strong character only appear now, after fighting Supernovas. Also Per usual OP movie we got an additional DV user as side haracter but this one plays out well in the end.<br />
But the main reason is the amount of players this movie involve in less than 2 hours. Have you seen the trailer?<br />
<br />
Pace 5<br />
This is Like MTG&#039;s War of the Spark novel by Greg Weisman: It is sluggish because this movie keep describing who is who even to some catchphrases. In some instances it work because we see Bullet recognize the rank of who he fight against.<br />
<br />
(Idle) Animation 6+1<br />
Right off the bat you can notice the brush-like edge for character design that they use in weekly anime. It looks low-budget at time, nothing fancy for a movie<br />
<br />
Fighing (Animation) 8<br />
Animation flow is energetic like typical movie. When they fight, the pace increase more than the anime. It feels really exciting especially when you remember we dont get many action beteren heavy hitters these past 3 months.<br />
CGI is used to animate the villain&#039;s power looks awesome even in dark hue and they manage to make distinct movement among full black haki. This carries to the hand drawing.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack 6+1<br />
Standard movie soundtrack, good but not memorable. Music fit the theme and help setting atmosphere and theh carry the anime sound effect. Arittakeno yume o kaki atsume!<br />
<br />
Final verdict 8,5<br />
Bring your friend to watch and have fun with the hype. But not worth rewatching in cinema or buying BD.

    This movie is a celebration of One Piece overrall, so please dont expect the storyline to be like Film Z, Gold or Strong World. The Fanservice is incredible and everything a One Piece fan would want. <br />
<br />
Some aspects of the story felt a little rush though and would have been great if the movie was a bit longer. Because of this, it made the villain seem irrelevant. More needed to be done to the story.<br />
<br />
The animation was fantastic as usual. I&#039;ve noticed they&#039;re using alot of CGI too.<br />
<br />

    Every One Piece fan wet dream. So many characters, so much action, everything is happening so fast that you cannot see it all.<br />
Bullet is just your average meathead who knows only how to punch people and things.<br />
But what was intersting was the scene at the end with Roger, who said a line that appeared in the manga not so long ago, in a flashback. <br />
A stunning movie, indeed.<br />
The art and animation were on point. Beautiful, gorgeous, so many cameos. Everything that a One Piece fan wants.<br />
Usopp was the goat, Hancock is amazing as always, Sabo is a cutie pie and a badass at the same

    This might be the worst One Piece movie yet, not only because its inconsistent but also just poorly made, and despite being a HUGE fan of One Piece(see my review for the series in general).. I just can&#039;t recommend this movie. <br />
<br />
People call this an &quot;all stars&quot; movie. We get 30+ characters alive after the time period of Dressrosa to just have a fun blast with the action, not caring much about plot, and I agree, it&#039;s not the plot I have a problem with, but it&#039;s the badly directed action/animation with too much redundancy.<br />
<br />
Maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;m a huge fan of OP is the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332700">
        problem so I have high expectations, but here we go:<br />
<br />
1: Stop redundancy:<br />
<br />
Smoker re-iterating for the 10th time &quot;why do I have to work with pirates/these idiots?&quot;. We get it already, please write something else in. This is also inconsistent with the character because in Punk Hazard, he set aside his differences to work towards a common goal without overly complaining about it. There are ways you can convey irritation without vocalizing it in dialogue every single time. Likewise execution of already known character tropes didn&#039;t hit me hard with emotion because they were poorly executed. There are entire unnecessary cuts just for a character to say what they&#039;re feeling rather than expressing it through action.<br />
<br />
2: Stop unnecessary cutting:<br />
<br />
Yes, there are 30+ characters that need screen time, but the answer is not to scatter action in every direction and cut so much that I lose track of whats going on. Some characters get weird small fractional slices of screen time and it&#039;s off putting. Why did the rest of the supernovas just get knocked out completely? The solution is to have characters split into unusual pairings, e.g Zoro and Killer, Boney and Nami, Sanji and Hancock, etc etc, and emphasize attacks/action in combinations, which not only gives us something new but also gives characters a more balanced amount of screen time and paves the way for more comedic/interesting interactions(since they only have Dressrosa level info on the characters).<br />
<br />
3: Pretty animation is not fun animation:<br />
<br />
Kill la Kill, John Wick(1&amp;2), Mad Max Fury Road, Kingsman(church scene only) etc are examples of media that have a very simple plot or virtually no plot, with emphasis on pure gorgeous action. Pretty action doesn&#039;t sell everything, more important is timing and framing. The animation was well drawn but not well paced is my problem. You can have media with no plot and all action work but this movie was not one of them.<br />
<br />
Your mileage may very. This movie was released at a very bad time, where if the intent was to just show off cool attacks in luscious animation, it has failed. There is lack of information on new moves for Kid, Zoro/the crew, Killer, etc because not many of them have went all out since after the time skip. They will during Wano, so all in all, this movie should have been done after or sometime during the climax of Wano. I don&#039;t see the point in making a movie about the crew at Dressrosa level power because the previous film, Gold, already did this in a fun way. Weirdly I think I might have enjoyed this more if it was the movie done right after Dressrosa to showcase the new world.. but even then it doesn&#039;t fix the issues as noted above.<br />
<br />
Things I liked about the movie:<br />
There were some surprising cool moments, e.g with Boa&#039;s kick, that got me in awe.<br />
Massive giant world being showcased.<br />
The gripping thing in the treasure chest<br />
<br />
Maybe upon a re-watch will I see the glory since it seems like I&#039;m in the minority of crazy OP fans that don&#039;t enjoy this. I overwhelmingly disagree that this is better than Z or Gold though. Honestly they should have spent the budget on this movie on making a game or improving the current anime

    This is a pretty &quot;all-star&quot; film.<br />
<br />
It has not really concordance into the One Piece series and all you see is mainly a lot of charachter that luffy and his crew met in their adventure.<br />
<br />
Apart from that, the story and the bad guy is rather negligible.<br />
<br />
Without spoilers into a speed abstarct, the crew come into a festival full of pirate. In their trek, they meet a lot of character they have seen before. <br />
The bad guy called Bullet made his apparence. Because of his past, he want to fight everyone to prove that he is the stronger and the one who deserve to be the King

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326273">
        of Pirates.<br />
After that, it is a succesion of fight and action until that bullet is defeated.<br />
<br />
Being a person who really love One Piece, this film is pretty exciting. But it has nothing to do with the One Piece series storyline. And because of all character present, you cannot see this film separatly of the series.

<br />
As a devoted One Piece Fan.Toei did it again in the same year. first was dbs broly now onto One Piece.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story (9): The story of One Piece Stampede was something only GODA is capable of making it could seem so bland but oda kept us in check with his Roger treasure reveal. I was at my edge of my seat during the scenes where the teasure was shown but not quite.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320748">
        The villain was part of rogers crew so we had more insight how strong one of his crew mates could be. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art(10): The ART/ANIMATION of this movie had my eyes hooked for each milisecond of the movie. The entire movie is full of sakuga moments, Each Fight was Toei surpassing themselves in there previous animations. Each character had a distinct look to them and none of them were forced.<br />
<br />
Sound(9): The music was phenomenal during fights especially the final fight against bullet. Played the most nostaglic opening of all of one piece which is We Are at the end which alone gives a 8 but other great moments were found in smaller area of the movie.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character(10): The greatest rejoicement of all of one piece so far.<br />
Litterally Almost &quot;EVERYONE WAS HERE&quot; Smash Ultimate One Piece Edition was the vibe the entire movie but missed a certain character like Jinbe.. All character&#039;s had spotlight and some were here for comedic relief like some buggy scenes, Ussop stole the show with this flim.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(10): This movie has to be the biggest piece of fanservice i&#039;ve been given as a one piece fan. I Loved it all the way through 0:00 - 1:41:00. Has to be one of my favorite movies of all time and i&#039;ve greatful to be able to watch it in theaters.<br />
<br />
Overall(10): This has been the one of the best if not the best experience i&#039;ve had as a one piece fan second to starting the series. Also caused the changing of my fav character in the show now ussop is claiming a spot in my Top 5. 10/10 WOULD WATCH AGAIN.<br />

           A lot of people would find this movie probably just a big mess of throwing characters in from every arc and so not a lot of actual dialogue went on between returning characters with the straw hats. But I feel the purpose of this movie, since this is the 20th anniversary movie of one piece, was trying to fit all the characters in and bring back some memories from the pass and how far they&#039;ve come. So as a long time fan, this movie was the perfect amount of excitement. I am bias so would give it 10/10,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320681">
        but just the movie itself I would give a 7/10, so my rating Is closer to 9/10. <br />
      The art was really all over the place, I can tell they were really trying for that 3d animation there, and included all these different art styles. A scene when the main villain takes his &quot;form&quot; , that scene was just straight out of like a King Kong movie and didn&#039;t match the rest of the one piece movie art at all, but it kinda worked for me? Like he looked pretty epic in that scene and it made me feel like, damn that is Stampede right there.  The fact that the art and animation was just all sorts of styles kinda made me feel like, &quot;Yup, that&#039;s One Piece for ya.&quot; <br />
       Overall it was still good old One Piece. It had great comedy bits, and although not fully emotional scenes, they were somewhat present. This movie I felt really covered most of the One Piece journeys feelings pretty well. So nvm the story, it was just a fun get-together festival.<br />
