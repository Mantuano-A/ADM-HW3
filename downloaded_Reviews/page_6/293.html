    I should have probably ate something before reviewing Golden Kamuy. Even thinking about this show makes me hungry and it’s not what I had in mind. But hey, seeing this golden egg return again for a sequel is such a welcome delight.<br />
<br />
Remember, this sequel continues from the first season and now indulges on the continued quest of Sugimoto and his ever daring adventures. It makes a memorable return with the first episode introducing Edogai Yasaku, a taxidermist. Right off from this season, he shows his true colors with his expertise related to human skin. While not being an actual killer or sadistic as Tsurumi, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296705">
        dare say that he’s not someone to be underestimated. An early alliance also sparks between him and Tsurumi. Speaking of which, do you remember Tsurumi?<br />
<br />
Serving as the lieutenant of the 7th division, Tsurumi is one of the key antagonists in this show. Many words can be used to describe him such as erratic and unstable. In the second season, he shows his ruthless behavior again although at the same time, I find his sarcastic tone and unpredictable personality to be most welcoming. It adds surprising elements that makes the plot much more fluid. But of course, who can forget about our Saichi Sugimoto and his companion, Asirpa. The pair became inseparable and their adventures continue with even more stakes on the line. Joining them is also Yoshitake Shirashi, the goofball butt monkey. While many see him as a comic relief with his carefree attitude, he does play valuable roles in this season. It’s easy to sugarcoat him as the middleman between the two main characters as well. <br />
<br />
However, I believe the second season is both plot and character driven. Early in this season, Suigimoto’s group deals with Edogai but we also shouldn’t forget about the man known as Hijikata. His past with Shinpachi is important to recognize due to their similarities during their younger years. In addition, we also take a deeper dive into his past when he was once a prisoner at Kaboto. And I think it’s one of the many things that makes this show stand out. It makes the audience care about characters like Hijikata. Even though he isn’t a prominent figurehead like Sugimoto, his past made him evolve as a person to where he is today. I should probably warn you though. This show is not light on violence, whether physically or mentally. But by showcasing its content in such way, it makes this anime that more realistic. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the plot, Shirashi gets caught that puts his life into jeopardy. While the audience may dismiss his capture as lesser importance, we should remember that he is in the hands of the 7th division. That’s the same group known for their sadistic tendencies thanks to their charismatic lieutenant, Tsurumi. The plot also brings in new characters like Kiyohiro Suzukawa, a deceptive man who is able to slip into the ranks of enemies. I should probably also mention that while Kiyohiro is more or less a con artist, his role brings in suspense to the plot. It makes me want to see them succeed in recusing Shirashi regardless what dangers await them. Eventually, the plot turns into a cat and mouse game. We get to see the main conflict escalate into fights for survival. Thankfully, Sugimoto still retains his military skills and we see them in action against the 7th division. On the other hand, the show also explores the character connection between Tanigaki and Kenkichi. I’ve mentioned before but this sequel is also very character driven that explores the past relationships between important characters. Kenkichi may seem like a minor character at first but the show reinforces the idea of how human lives can be so fragile. The second season establishes an important concept about how broken their world is and what characters can do to change it.<br />
<br />
Now while I can say this season can get deep and emotional, there’s also a decent amount of lighthearted moments. If you remember from the first season, food is a part of the show that eclipses more than just a gimmick. That’s because food is essentially for survival and we get no shortage of those from this season. Asirpa brings in her knowledge of the Ainu culture with her as well those survival skills. We even get woodcock hunting as a showcase of one of her many talents. I should say that Aspira is a breakout character. She and Sugimoto has been through a lot together and despite some of their personality differences, they work together well as a pair. My impression of Aspira this season is no less different than the first season as she continues to educate viewers about Ainu culture. In later episodes, her eyes also play important role in a case that adds suspense to the story. But don’t let that fool you from the show’s motives. It has a great amount of balanced content between the light and dark. In other words, this season has an emotional and serious story but always has time to find moments to make fun of itself. If you don’t believe me, just check to see how much man service this season really became.<br />
<br />
Thanks to what it has established, I say  without a shadow of a doubt that Golden Kamuy Season 2 is more than just watchable. It’s a show that manages to capitalize on its variety of genres and bring in a exhilarating story. It has a larger-than-life character cast with important purposes. With each passing episode, I felt more compelled to watch more. And so should you.

    The legendary series that is Golden Kamuy has had its shares of greatness, starting with Season 1 in Spring 2018, and now the sequel this season, which expands upon where Season 1 left off, but with more refined balance between the comedy and action. In more ways than one, Season 2 solidified everything that was lacking in Season 1, and made it tenfold better IMO.<br />
<br />
We continue on with Immortal Sugimoto, Asirpa and Co. on their journey to find not just the gold, but the man responsible for the whole fiasco in the first place: Nopperabo, the big eyes Ainu of a traitor, which is also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296744">
        Asirpa&#039;s father in cold spirit and truth. In the context of having watched Season 1, Season 2 here is more grim, fast-paced, and the amount of violence and action doesn&#039;t hold the series back, with some of the greatest scenes designated at moments where predicted but last for as long as it should be, so long as the balance was held. So, with the new season, you&#039;re getting twice the action, twice the excitement and worries that are just chillax; the surface of the iceberg.<br />
<br />
Golden Kamuy&#039;s characters are always the crew that we always find it intriguing, solely at first with people like Hijikata, Ogata, whom get their characterizations more heavily involved. And with how Season 2 ramps up the ante, along with the alliances of everyone working together for a common goal, the risk of betrayal is something that cannot be taken lightly. Quite possibly the biggest detractor is Lt. Tsurumi himself, looking through Season 2 lists quite a good range of capabilities of the 7th Division captain himself, from being the model for other calefares to being more relentless in the final stages of the cat and mouse chase to Sugimoto and Co. I&#039;d say that with everything out of the bag this time, Lt. Tsurumi is the most fearsome character (even more than Season of 1), but everyone has upgraded their game into the series, and it&#039;s a firm foundation.<br />
<br />
Once again, Geno Studio did an amazing production on Season 2 here, omitting the awful CGI bears in change for some great action and backgrounds. However, the drawback is that for the night scenes, the entire show goes into entirely black mode and it&#039;s barely discernable when put in comparison to Season 1. Maybe some lighting would have been fine, but for what it is, I&#039;ll take it any other day.<br />
<br />
The music got a good upgrade and a better follow-up over Season 1, with Sayuri and MY FIRST STORY&#039;s collab for the OP, that not just sounds a whole lot bad-ass and better in every regard, but also aesthetically. With that said, the ED, featuring some loud-banging and bashing uncle that&#039;s on drugs, most would find this very noisy and distracting. Golden Kamuy is a series that just needs a good balance of substance, not some over-the-top values that cue the series. But on hindsight, it couldn&#039;t have been the perfect ED but hey, it&#039;s better than nothing.<br />
<br />
What an amazing series from start to end. Definitely would recommend this series to historical action fans, but first, go watch Season 1 then come back for the sequel.

    I found out about this show at random and watched season 1 &amp; 2 back-to-back and I was so happy to know they are making season 3.<br />
<br />
It phenomenal and as much as I want to continue the story reading the Mangas if they exist (never looked into it) I am more then happy to wait for season 3 to come out will all the effort they put into it. As I said on my review of season 1 it has a very Rurouni Kenshin vibe but a less superman type feel behind the main character.<br />
<br />
Animal lovers beware they are still more then happy to kill,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317572">
        &quot;chita-chop,&quot; and eat anything that moves on all fours or swims in water.<br />
<br />
If your looking for a more serious vibe in an anime without some wussbag teenage highschooler as the protagonist this is for you. Nothing but brutal battles and a driving story done on a very humanistic level. If someone dies more then likely it will be in a way you havnt seen before in the show. No repeat bulletholes here. Faces will be ripped to shreads, human skins with be carved off out to create a map, and your love for the show will rise.

    I like Golden Kamuy. It has the slice of life charm with its episodic nature, there&#039;s great animation that works in tandem with the narrative, and most importantly, it is unapologetically itself. I think this show is unique, meshing Japan&#039;s historical periods together and bringing cultures to life. Golden Kamuy never gets away from what makes it stand out. There are witty jokes, there is great interactions between characters, each character is consistent in many different moments. There is the interesting mix of Japan&#039;s history coupled with very flamboyant characters and creates an interesting contradiction to what is typically shown on TV. What you can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297288">
        expect to get out of this show is twisted humor, animation that complements the narrative and interactions, and a whole lot of confusion. <br />
<br />
Why I say confusion is that the narrative has a rollercoaster trend. The light at the end of the tunnel seems to always get closer, then farther, then closer, then farther. It isn&#039;t clear whether you can determine if the next episode will get you to the promised land or if we will see another hinna hinna episode, but frankly that is the charm of the show. I can feel the passion and charm of the characters when they just interact with each other over nature and survival of the fittest tactics. The down time really brings out the characterization and gives a nice break to high, fast paced scenes regarding the end game. All of a sudden, it is hard to determine each character&#039;s true goal and when the plot twists hit, they hit hard. They kept me on the edge of my seat and I started appreciating the seemingly pointless down time scenes because of the little things that we can see in characters. This confusion of the narrative actually made me enjoy the show more, because it diversified the content while also jumping themes/tones. I&#039;m more of a fan of the light hearted side, where we can just learn the history of the Ainu and learn more about cultures we otherwise would&#039;ve never hear of. <br />
<br />
However, the animation overall is not part of Golden Kamuy&#039;s strong points. *CUE CG BEAR*. There are a lot of shortcuts with stills with slightly moving animated blood or things like that. The face animations are great though. Each character display their emotions and disgust so vehemently, it is hard to not appreciate them and just laugh. Some scenes were more gorey than what I expect from TV Anime, but they weren&#039;t as appealing as it could be. It got the point across though and I can appreciate why in certain areas in the narrative, they upped the gore. It displayed the stakes and importance of the respective scenes.<br />
<br />
Golden Kamuy took me by storm, I wasn&#039;t sure if it was going to hit the right notes for me. But I soon realized how much charm and passion went into the writing, especially developing the characters, who carry this show. The plot is interesting, but loses steam in certain parts. It overall hinna hinna&#039;d all over me though and I can&#039;t get enough of the witty humor, the stupid jokes, the idiocy of the characters, the food wars like eposodic episodes, and  its charm.<br />
<br />
Now onto the real review: Go read the manga.

    A great continuation to an already great series...<br />
<br />
Art=5/Sound=9: <br />
The anime&#039;s main flaw is actually the art and animation, character designs are really basic and are constantly recycled throughout the anime, backgrounds look terrible and the effects seem cheap and out of place; in addition the animation is very rough and has very little flow which makes the show seem like a coloured manga with voice acting and music rather than an actual anime. However, when it comes to sound, this anime is fucking phenomenal! The OP is probably one of the best this season (Both OPs probably top 20 this year) and the soundtrack is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292937">
        perfect for every scenario; but we can&#039;t continue without mentioning the voice acting which is fantastic and helps to bring these characters to life and repairs the flaws created by the mediocre and borderline bad art and animations! <br />
<br />
Characters=9/Plot=8:<br />
The continuation to this already very intriguing story has been continued to be excecuted well and eventhough no major plot points have happened yet in the first episodes; there is nothing I can fault either. Furthermore, the characters are fucking great! I love EVERY character in the anime and most of them get a decent amount of development; it also helps that there are constant comedic moments throughout the show that make you love the characters even more. I also love how eventhough we get to see the funny side of most characters (especially the 2 main characters and even some &quot;villains&quot;) every single character is a badass at will and the transition from comedy to drama is done very well, it&#039;s Gintama-like.<br />
<br />
Overall=8:<br />
Golden Kamuy&#039;s second season has delivered in every aspect aside from the dodgy animation/art and because of that it&#039;s definitely a top 10 anime this season (maybe even top 5).<br />
PS: Sugimoto is probably one of the most badass MCs you will see this year!<br />

    Excellent comedy with Shiraishi, head of the department, the faces are brilliant, hahahaha, especially those of Asirpa-san.<br />
<br />
Reasonably good soundtrack, nothing to complain about, especially mentioning these last three episodes;<br />
<br />
The action scenes are present in most episodes and are great, a kind of brutality with determination and without fear of cutting, being shot or dying, it seems that the characters do not feel pain and it is not bad, it is just an observation.<br />
<br />
This story teaches us a lot about the cuisine of the Hunters of Ainus and Matagi region, almost every episode where we have the main characters eating local food and telling details about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329768">
        it. For me, this is a difference at work compared to others. . We are taught about many things in the culture of these peoples and that enriches the work.<br />
<br />
It is difficult for us to see an anime story with so many characters being developed and deepened, for all kinds of tastes and personalities, there are BADASS and Mysterious (Ogata), Samurai badass and the guy who conspires against everything and everyone (Nishijika), Relief comic (Shiraishi), cutest little thing that exists (Asirpa-san &lt;3), unbeatable immortal (Sugimoto, The immortal) and the good-natured ex-soldier and ex-hunter matagi, I thought he would be the antagonist of the beginning of the series, but I was totally wrong (Tanigaki Nispa), these were some of the personalities that stood out, there are several other very interesting ones too. PS: Almost every episode has a new character being introduced, this is incredible, because the series is not just content with them.<br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s a great story, fun to watch and follow throughout the episodes, diversity is one of the strongest points of this work, it is not just the gold rush, but the journey, the day to day and the adventures for which pass. the way. The moments of tension are too good, they leave us breathless, not knowing what will happen in the next scene and always trying to surprise us.<br />
<br />
Very recommended to watch and recommend to friends, I find it very difficult for a normal person, with good conscience not to crack the beak several times or even get excited about the end of the episodes, leaving a hook for the next one and making us watch more and more non-stop .

Golden Kamui returns with the second cour/season which imo is better than the first season. The story, characters and plot have improved a lot and what I liked in this season is how they focus more on the  side characters.<br />
The characters maintain their unique traits and the enjoyment is better with the addition of the new characters that are introduced.<br />
<br />
If you were familiar with the first season one of the main themes that is executed is the insatiable hunger for war/fight that the human nature is capable of. Our characters despite  the Japanese-Russian war is over are still living in the past on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296776">
        that blood-dyed battlefield were many lives were lost and heroes emerge. <br />
Being unable to escape their past that hunts them every night our characters seek something that can prove their meaning and existence during those times. That thing is the Ainu gold  which is said  that  with its value you can buy a country. It&#039;s ironic but is the raw truth on  how a common goal can bring together people with different ideals and principles and make them work together as a team. In regard of that season 2 dives deeper into that matter and adds different obstacles and conflicts to test out their teamwork but also their trust in each other. It has a slow start but after a couple of episodes everything becomes a roller coaster of enyoiment, maniac laughing and  plot twists that you don&#039;t expect to happen.<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s take a look on our characters which I must say this season has done a good job at making them memorable. While the first season made us familiar with the knowleadge and cuisine obsession for Asirpa, the toughness and recklessness actions of Sugimito and Shiraishi&#039;s slipperiness, season 2 brought foward  new stories and revealed the reasons and motivations for Ogata and Tanigaki in seeking the Ainu Gold.<br />
We all know that Ogata is a skilled sniper from Tsurumi&#039;s  7th division who wanted something new thus leaving the division on his own will. But we never knew what were his reasons on doing that? What was the reason why Tanigaki was going on that journey and what were the real intentions of Hijikata and his men? Why was Tsurumi and his men a torn in their back all journey long?<br />
<br />
Well all of this questions are answered in this season by the characters themselves. They tell us the viewers in a form of a monologue their past choices and what made them end up the people they are today. Some of their stories are hilarious (I gotta mention that Tsurumi&#039;s was the one that I laughed the most and the one that fitted his twisted personality so well), some of their are filled with regret, some of them with vengeange and finally some of them managed to stir up some emotions (especially Tanigaki&#039;s conclusion to his story).<br />
<br />
Regarding the bear- cgi complains from the first season this season managed to solve those problems and the animation improved. The ost is the same (great) and the animation for the  opening song manages to mix the knowledge of Asirpa&#039;s cuisine with the traits of our characters. As a conclusion I gotta mention that Tsurumi&#039;s men are damn awesome and their twisted personalities are damn enjoyable. And I love how they mix up the craziness and smart decisions depicting a unique trait in Tsurumi&#039;s character. His qoutes are damn juicy, here is a example to know what I mean :<br />
(To Sugimoto)&quot;I&#039;m your Shinigami. Your life is a candle, and I can blow it out anytime I choose&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you wanna find out more about what I wrote in this review you gotta check this season out! <br />

    I started watching &quot;Golden Kamuy&quot; on a whim and didn&#039;t expect anything from it, but it has quickly become one of my favourite shows in recent years. Rarely have I seen a show that has managed to mix so many different genres in such a seamless way. On the one hand, we have a show about survival in the wild and a treasure hunt that includes a pretty gruesome treasure map, on the other hand, we have one of the strangest, craziest comedies with a seriously unconventional sense of humour. I mean, honestly, how many shows have you seen in which a creepy taxidermist who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314550">
        loves to create clothes out of human skin falls in love with a psychopath who misses a large part of his cranium?  It sounds really strange on paper, but it&#039;s very funny on screen. <br />
<br />
The heart of the show is clearly the relationship between Asiripa and Sugimoto. The relationship has a lot of heart and what originally started out as a purely business relationship has now become a deep and intimate friendship. Besides the two, there is also a whole bunch of really interesting side characters. <br />
<br />
What really distinguishes the show is that there are no one-dimensional characters, but all of them are lovingly worked out. It&#039;s hard not to like the whole crazy bunch and it&#039;s even harder to find out who&#039;s &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; because there are constantly changing coalitions. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s really a shame that the series has few fans in the West (similar to &quot;3-Gatsu No Lion&quot;), because &quot;Golden Kamuy&quot; beats many other shows that are popular in the West by far.<br />
<br />
Small warning: The show is definitely to be rated &quot;18&quot; or hard R, maybe even NC-17, because of its extreme brutality (not always but sometimes).<br />

    I regard sequels as an &#039;obligatory watch&#039; since there&#039;s always an itch inside of me that yells at me telling me that I better finish what I started.  Sometimes I hate that itch cause sometimes things I loathe get the coveted second season.  But usually I get stuff like Golden Kamuy to watch a sequel of.  And my reaction for these moments are always: Yes.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Golden Kamuy continues the journey of Immortal Sugimoto&#039;s (and co.) journey towards finding the fabled Ainu gold hidden on the tattoos of freed prisoners.<br />
<br />
Really that&#039;s about all I can give for a prior synopsis cause any more information would complicate the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297401">
        already massive narrative that&#039;s being tackled at here.  The name of the game for this season involves a mix of backstories, plot progression, truths, betrayal, and several (that means more than one) prison escapes.<br />
<br />
The end result of this mixed bag is a meshed narrative where clear opposing sides established in the previous season are more or less thrown out the window as the end result to everything is similar yet converging interests contrasted by different ways of doing things, unlikely alliances, different groups converging and diverging, swapping with different members of each other&#039;s group, ultimately making the entire cast more or less a gray area in this war for the gold.<br />
<br />
Sugimoto and Asiripa at least don&#039;t take the show&#039;s primarily protagonist role this time, offhanding that opportunity to multiple members of the sidecast so everyone gets fleshed out and their time in the limelight.  This gives us A or B parts of episodes entirely devoted to various backstories featuring the historical impact of the Russo-Japanese war that presides over the cast, as well as how other characters impact each other, either through conflicting interests/information or similar goals with different ways to reach there.  It feels complicated explaining it, but the one phrase that I find explains Golden Kamuy&#039;s narrative is &quot;It just works.&quot;<br />
<br />
That phrase even extends to the comedy as very often even enemies or at the very least opposing characters crack jokes at each other, and the show so often doesn&#039;t take itself seriously, giving brevity to the more serious aspects, striking a neat balance of serious, complication, history, culture, comedy, and mystery.  Really, I just want more.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
As previously mentioned, both Sugimoto and Asiripa don&#039;t get that much added to their characters.  Asiripa a little less cause she is at the forefront of this plot trying to find her father and much of the plot this time around is focused on determining whether or not her father is the fabled Noppera-bou or not.<br />
<br />
Really the shining characters are the sidecast we&#039;re introduced to this time around.  This is the kind of cast that even if their names escape you, their mannerisms or their story as to why/how they got to this point in their lives stick in your mind.  The backstories shine for only a select few members of the cast, like the fortune teller Inkaramat and Ogata, serving to give a full dump on what they&#039;re all about after a small trickle from what we&#039;ve seen before with their previous actions.  These characters get what they do put into perspective and really stand as some of the show&#039;s more shining moments because they start to feel more like characters, and given the cast&#039;s overall dynamic, really only adds to it.<br />
<br />
Of course that&#039;s not all the sidecast has to offer, as to make sure you remember them, the show gives some of its more less important members (primarily those in Lt. Tsurumi&#039;s camp) qualities of insanity that are both hilarious and actually really unsettling given how out of their mind some of these people are.  Ranging from a crazed taxidermist to members of the 7th who have such a hard-on for Tsurumi that it&#039;s both hilarious and extremely unsettling, you really won&#039;t forget them simply because of the kind of shit this show manages to pull without batting an eye.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Memorable sidecast<br />
+ Overall extremely memorable cast<br />
+ Really fucking weird characters (that are also entertaining as hell)<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Part of me really wants to ask whether or not anyone in Geno Studio ever questioned the kind of crap they were drawing.  Cause half of Golden Kamuy&#039;s comedic routine is in the visuals, and my god is the absurdity factor skyrocketed.<br />
<br />
Much of the art is the same as season one (with much less CGI animals, we swear), with only slight inconsistency issues that I&#039;ve noticed in a few frames.  Aside from that, everything is good.  Which is what I would be saying if not for the absurdist and surrealist visual comedy that&#039;s being shown off here.  First off, there is an abundance of manservice here, so much so that I couldn&#039;t help but laugh at just how dumb everything becomes.  Couple that with some unsettling imagery played for laughs and some surprisingly homoerotic scenes for a show about an underground war for a precious metal, and what you end up getting is Golden Kamuy, which for some reason all makes sense in context.  I swear, it does.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Considering how good &#039;Winding Road&#039; was in season one, I was prepared for what was going to come next to not be as good by comparison.  &quot;Reimei&quot; by Sayuri and MY FIRST STORY I don&#039;t personally believe is as good as Winding Road.  It&#039;s a good song, but putting it next Season one&#039;s, I just thinking the first was better.  &quot;Tokei-dai no Kane&quot; by eastern youth is by comparison a little bit more similar to season one&#039;s Hibana.  A little more rock than I prefer, but it&#039;s not a bad listen.  Personally though, they&#039;re not as good as season one&#039;s group, and for that reason I don&#039;t really care for them that much.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
I was not at all prepared for what was to come watching season two of Golden Kamuy.  A part of me was aware of the absurdist qualities of the show, but never in my life did I ever expect the kind of shit that I saw here.  And yet, I&#039;m ok with it.<br />
<br />
Golden Kamuy is one of those shows that has become more of a favorite of mine in recent history.  It&#039;s a consistently good show with a well written narrative coupled with a likable cast and good pacing, mixing its story up between backstories, plot progression, comedy, action, and mystery.  It&#039;s such a varied show with so many highs that I really cannot come down from the high horse that I&#039;ve gone on watching this show and enjoying every moment of it.  They even managed to throw in a love subplot, a freaking love subplot into this thing that still works in context to the story.  Seriously, there is just so much stuff in this show yet it all just works.  It baffles me how all of this just functions as well as it does, but that&#039;s the reason why I just really like this show and wait with bated breath for the third season to come.<br />
<br />
This is one of those shows that really bears watching.  There&#039;s so much going on that works, and it&#039;s a great shonen series that isn&#039;t afraid to do whatever the hell it wants.  The amount of creative freedom here is astounding, and I&#039;m just really glad to have a series that&#039;s this good to watch.

    Continuing from an already amazing first season, the second season does not disappoint at all. Even though the start to this season is very slow, I believe it was a good choice as things have not been rushed and new characters&#039; introductions have been handled quite well.<br />
Art has improved vastly from the first season. No more CGI bears, that&#039;s right. However, compared to other shows currently airing, the art and animation is still very lacking for such a good animation. This is the only drawback from this amazing anime.<br />
Just as in the first season, the OPs and EDs are still great. Although this season doesn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293494">
        jump right into action, it instead gives a lot of time to character development. This is the standing out point of Golden Kamuy. Almost characters are given enough screen time to develop their own unique traits and personalities. The characters in this show are so lovable, even the antagonists. <br />
Overall: 8/10 . A really great show that deserves a lot more attention. Definitely top 5 anime of this season.

    At the time I wrote this review, the average rating for the second season was 8.17 while the average rating for the first season was 7.78. I believe that the first season gave some viewers the bad impression that the plot is all over the place since Sugimoto has the goal to get money to support his dead friend&#039;s family while supporting Asirpa in getting justice for the death of her father. I get that the stakes for Sugimoto seem misplaced since time is moving forward and there were probably better opportunities for him to get money if he wasn&#039;t so fixated on sticking with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306722">
        his morals. I do wish that the show explains why he is so willing to take his time to find the gold he needs to help his friends wife and why he doesn&#039;t check if she is okay from time to time. However, I believe that the second season offers some hints as to why it isn&#039;t easy for us to understand Sugimoto as some of the other characters. Sugimoto is a man who was changed by war and has the desire to change back to who he was before the war or at least remove the psychological scars left on him so that he can function as a proper caretaker for his friend&#039;s wife. I recommend keeping this in mind as you watch the second season of the anime (always ask yourself why we weren&#039;t shown Sugimoto&#039;s past before the war). The second thing I want to recommend is to be aware of the motifs of mortality (how each of the characters view life and death through how they see events and natural phenomenons go about around them) and the cycles <br />
of life with the changing seasons as time goes on. If you watch from the first episode of the first season all the way through the last episode of the second season, you will have a greater appreciation for this story and the journey of each of its characters. From the first four episodes of the first season, you will feel incredulous of why this veteran is risking everything to find the treasure but by the end of the second season you will realize that this is the journey and path that he must follow to find himself and move on. I hope that you will come upon the realization that Sugimoto not only needs to get the money to support his friends wife, but also be someone that she can turn to for consolation as a family friend instead of being a burden as a husk of her old friend that is beyond recognition and frightening.

    This is the second part of this surprising anime.. so far behind stayed those 3DCGI bears, ok we have seconds again but not so uggly like &quot;that&quot; one.. This part really doit everything better again. The rythm of the storytelling is incredible, and every new character is incredible like everyone we known yet. <br />
Sugimoto and his entourage continue charming as well as the antagonists, we can really empatyze with everyone as well. <br />
In the artistic apart we can see considerable improvements. The music incredible. And one last special point for that incredible comic treatment.<br />

        atrás quedaron esos osos 3DCGI, ok, tenemos segundos de nuevo pero no tan feos como &quot;ese&quot; ... Esta parte realmente lo hace todo mejor de nuevo. El ritmo de la narración es increíble, y cada personaje nuevo es increíble como todos los que conocimos hasta ahora. <br />
Sugimoto y su séquito continúan encantando al igual que los antagonistas, realmente podemos empatizar con todos también.<br />
En el apartado artístico podemos ver mejoras considerables. La musica increíble. Y un último punto especial por ese increíble tratamiento cómico.

    I talked about the first series of Golden Kamuy about four months back. It was a piece with an interesting premise and some solid moments. When we left off, Sugimoto and his group were competing with Tsurumi and his soldiers as well as Hijikata Toshozou and his former prisoners. Unbeknownst to Sugimoto or Asirpa their comrade, Shiraishi had made a deal with Hijikata and was playing both sides of the street. Let&#039;s see where things go from there.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
When we open, Tsurumi is meeting with a grave robbing taxidermist for what I&#039;m sure are completely sane reasons. Meanwhile, Sugimoto and his group are on their way

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315848">
        to Abashiri prison to meet with Nopperabo. Which also seems to be the goal of Hijikata&#039;s group. Back in Asirpa&#039;s village, Inkarmat persuades Tanigaki to help her find Asirpa. They&#039;re joined by an Ainu boy who&#039;s just starting to take an interest in boobs. <br />
<br />
This series suffers from the same big issue as the first. Namely, it can be overly slow with overly long scenes about how to hunt different game or how to prepare it. I&#039;m sorry, but if I wanted to know how to prepare snares for this particular bird or how to properly cook Salmon heads I&#039;d watch a proper hunting or cooking show.<br />
<br />
The series also continues to have some jokes that don&#039;t land very well. At least they stopped having Asirpa refer to miso as faeces. In this series our not really funny comedic moment is Asirpa referring to Ushiyama as &quot;Chinpo-Sensei.&quot; Next season, she&#039;ll probably call Inkarmat vaginal squirt woman or meet a dog called prolapsed anus or something. Since all the worst, most drug out jokes in this franchise are just Asirpa referring to something in a toilet joke fashion. <br />
<br />
That being said, the narrative is still interesting with a strong concept backing it. I also appreciate that it doesn&#039;t drag out events. Yeah, it has its other forms of padding but at least the plot moves briskly when the series is actually covering the plot elements. The more comedic elements do largely work. This one has some very morbid humour, mostly involving the taxidermist but that works for me. I&#039;m a fan of well executed macabre elements. This series also follows the first one&#039;s example in that it stops off at a very good point. We get some closure for some major plot points while also having plenty of intrigue to carry another series.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Our big three are still Sugimoto, Asirpa &amp; Tanigaki. This series gives us some more development for Shiraishi, Ogata, Inkarmat &amp; Hijikata. But the characters aside from that core group still gravitate towards the weaker side. They&#039;re lucky to get some very simple motivation and hints of something more to them. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Honestly, the series would look better without the goofier character designs. I understand that it&#039;s not entirely serious but it&#039;s hard for the more serious elements to have the full gravity they should when you&#039;ve got goofy looking characters like Tsurumi or Ushiyama floating around in the middle of it all. On the positive side, the nature scenes look fantastic, the action sequences are appropriately intense and the backgrounds are nicely detailed. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The acting remains a very strong element. The performances are beyond what they need to be. Particularly for those characters who don&#039;t have that much depth to them. Suehiro Kenichiro gives us another strong soundtrack. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
It&#039;s heavily implied that three of Tsurumi&#039;s men have the hots for him. I don&#039;t see the appeal he has personally, but I won&#039;t judge them for what they&#039;re into. There&#039;s also a scene that gets really homo-erotic in a way that borders on being a gay joke but with clever execution that actually makes it work quite well. <br />
<br />
Areas of improvement:<br />
<br />
This is honestly pretty much the same as my list for the first series. Since this one has basically the same issues.<br />
<br />
We don&#039;t need long explanations of how to hunt and cook. They&#039;re just padding.<br />
Can we have a series of this where Asirpa doesn&#039;t drag a semi-dirty joke into the ground? First it was confusing Miso for excrement Now it&#039;s the Chinpo-sensei thing. <br />
Rework the goofy designs. <br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
The second series is on par with the first. It&#039;s a strong, well crafted anime that has the definite potential to get stronger. I&#039;m giving it a 7/10, like the first series. Maybe the third will raise that score a bit when it comes out. We&#039;ll find out.

    Very close in quality to the first season, but takes a different approach to the story than present in the first season. <br />
<br />
In the first season, there were 3 main parties separate from each other in the hunt. Whereas the second season focuses on how these alliences are not cut-and-dry, with people betraying each other and joining other parties. <br />
<br />
This was unexpected going in, but it makes the plot much more interesting as characters betray each other while staying true to their characters. <br />
<br />
Speaking of characters, we recieve background information for a lot of characters which develops them more and gives insight to their goals

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342240">
        and motives. <br />
<br />
The animation was still good with the exception of some CGI and using still frames for a larger battle towards the end. <br />
<br />
In general, I enjoyed the first two seasons and plan to watch the third season when it comes out. I think this series is pretty overlooked, even though it is pretty good fun and pretty accessible. Closer to a 7 than a 9.

    &quot;I&#039;m immortal!&quot; he screams as he tries to hype himself up and hopes that the audience is a 12 year old boy that is also getting hyped. <br />
<br />
I will keep it short, just like my patience. So I will adress only the points that annoyed me the most that made me stop watching.<br />
<br />
1) The humor wears thin. Same jokes over and over again. The same ones like in season 1. I guess it works well with memeculture.<br />
<br />
2) Also I never liked the huge food-fetish of animes which goes over the top here. hinna hinna and whatever eating the same thing they did 3 episodes ago.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389185">
        At least show different dishes of the Ainu-culture. (On a side-note this feels sort of insulting to the ainus, with what japan did to them. However I shall not pass judgement since I only know a sliver what was going on there...)<br />
<br />
3) The charakters are all some mentally ill wierdos without any lack of sense and only one catchphrase. They feel more like caricatures or more like the author had one post-it note for everyone and used the space for only the face.

    This is a review of the anime only. I have not read the manga.<br />
<br />
This was a stellar sequel to season one. Everything I loved about season one holds true for this season as well. To see my review of season one, go to: https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=295762. I&#039;m not going to reiterate it here.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll touch on a few things that were different or just really well done. <br />
<br />
The first one is the characterization. That&#039;s been a stellar feature of this anime all the way through and that wasn&#039;t lost during this season at all. In fact, it deepened. We got to see more about the characters and how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302770">
        war changed them and it was powerful and emotional. The scene with Sugimoto talking about persimmons had me clutching my heart. <br />
<br />
In that same vein, the characters stayed true to their personality 100% of the time and that really was refreshing. Sometimes writers change characters too much or don&#039;t give an explanation for a change and this story didn&#039;t do that. Sugimoto did become slightly less anti-hero and a little more hero but he was still enough anti-hero that his motives were often in question and that was good. <br />
<br />
I loved the inclusion of historical facts in this anime and one of the most moving for me was the photo of Hijikata. The real Hijikata was one of the only Shinsengumi to get his picture taken (I think Saito did as well) and they replicated the photo perfectly. <br />
<br />
The inclusion of Ainu culture was a little food heavy but they did also include other aspects, which was nice. I liked that they were all becoming closer to one another as a family type unit by embracing the Ainu traditions. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m really hoping there will be a season three at some point. I do not like reading a manga after I&#039;ve seen the anime and I prefer watching an anime to reading the manga. Nothing was resolved at the end of this season and while it didn&#039;t end on the cliffhanger that it could have, it&#039;s not a resolution by any means.

    Golden Kamuy is a good show. Season 2 continues that steak from season 1. <br />
<br />
The significant development this season is that Sugimoto&#039;s group teams up with one of the other gold seeking factions first to deal with a fake tattoed skin problem and then to break into Abashiri prison when the maker of the map Noperaubu is.<br />
<br />
The addition of the other faction is great fun as they are still on pin and needles trusting each other, but are still down for cooking a good meal, and the other characters make for great additions to these.<br />
<br />
I watched the 2nd season dubbed as I heard good things

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300425">
        about it the after finishing the 1st and they were not wrong the dub is excellently produced and would be my recommended way of watching it.<br />
<br />
Not much different from my season 1 review it a good show and I recommend it.

    The second season is arguably better than the first one, and here is why.<br />
<br />
Story 10 : The first season spent a great deal of effort in world building and character development. It&#039;s easy to see the first season as a kind of setup for the second season. <br />
<br />
The second season is where everything begin to move. I feel like the story is build like a movie, and this season makes me think of the movie &quot;Snatch&quot; with Brad Pitt. It&#039;s a movie that revolves around a bank robbery and while you watch the movie, you follow different group of characters on different point of view.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422449">
        Here it&#039;s the same, you have three main groups, Sugimoto&#039;s group, Hijikata&#039;s group and Tsurumi&#039;s group. And as in this movie, everytime something happens to one of the group, the story changes for everyone.<br />
<br />
I think it was really well written. Everything is here to make a good movie from the season, the pace, the characters, a beginning, a middle and an end really well written. <br />
<br />
Art 10 : Same art as always, it&#039;s a great art that is malleable, chill to watch in the comedy segment but impactful on action scene. And one point for the beautiful world settings, the nature is really well drawn. <br />
<br />
Sound 10 :  The OSTs are great, the seiyuus do a wonderful job and the sounds are perfectly integrated into this season to pace it like a movie. If you are focused on it, you can recognize &quot;zones&quot; where the sounds are chill, other zones where it&#039;s hectic and restless. But it&#039;s not in one episode, it&#039;s like the zones are spread on the 12 episodes as if it was only one episode.<br />
<br />
Character 10 : <br />
<br />
I have nothing to add from what I said last season. The development is really well done. This season the author added a few new character like Koito, Suzukawa or Kiroranke, every character being exceptional. No one has a usual role, it&#039;s like they are their own persons. It&#039;s like the author is flexing on his skills at that point, when a huge amount of anime can&#039;t get away from the template character you have like the tsundere or the nekketsu MC. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; Overall 10 :<br />
<br />
Golden Kamuy 2nd Season is, in my opinion, the best second season I saw in an anime. <br />
<br />
In most anime I saw, the second season is the continuation of the first one, and the first one was a complete piece on it&#039;s own. <br />
<br />
Here, the first season is amazing, but was also created to be a base for the second season. And the second season is really investing it all to the continuation of the story, all thanks to the world building and settlement of the first season.<br />
<br />
You can see it like a similarity to LOTR, first season was The Fellowship of the Ring<br />
 and the second season was The Two Towers

    If you enjoyed the first season you will enjoy this season. Go ahead and give it a watch! <br />
<br />
While the season finale more than makes up for it the show this season I feel becomes far more focused on humor than it does seriousness. I feel that I am in the minority but I wish there was less comedy. There were some light-hearted humor and funny moments in season one. But the number of episodes seemingly dedicated to homoerotic jokes this season was more than I wanted and expected. It&#039;s almost uncomfortable at times. <br />
<br />
In season one I loved the focus on survival with hunting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review371100">
        and dealing with cold weather. This compared to the first season is gone. With little hope of it coming back. This was an aspect that drew me into the show. Its departure is something to mourn as it&#039;s unlikely to see a show of a similar caliber handle realistic survival. <br />
<br />
TDLR: For many, it was a welcome change to see the uptick in humor and homoerotic jokes. However, for me, it overall hurt the show more than it helped. While I would eagerly rewatch the first season in its entirety I don&#039;t ever see myself coming back to this season. <br />
<br />
This all said. The season finale more than makes up for it and leaves you hungry for the third season. The character progression, art, and sound design continue to be phenomenal. <br />
<br />
A very solid 7/10.

    Somehow, Golden Kamuy season two managed to be superior to the already great season 1.  Take everything you loved about Golden Kamuy in the first season, and then add to that intrigue, shifting loyalties and betrayals, shocking swerves and even more manic action.  <br />
<br />
Basically, in this season, all of the maniacs of Golden Kamuy begin to coalesce into larger groups to find the skins and get Asirpa&#039;s father to reveal the location of the gold.  Sugimoto and Hijikata&#039;s teams join forces, along with a few others, while Tsurumi calls in even more nuts from the 7th division to stop them.  <br />
<br />
As

          <span style="display: none;" id="review348811">
        a result, you have the same game of psychotic death, mixed with dark humor as the first season, with the added bonus of wondering who will betray whom, who is working with Tsurumi secretly, and what will be the end game for Asirpa and the Ainu gold.  <br />
<br />
If I had any one complaint about this anime it&#039;s this: It played with my emotions in the last episode. Everyone who has seen it knows exactly what I&#039;m talking about. Don&#039;t do stuff like that if you don&#039;t mean it.  Still, it was so shocking, I won&#039;t forget it. But...don&#039;t play with our emotions, Smokey.<br />
<br />
If you aren&#039;t watching this series, you are seriously missing out.  It&#039;s unique setting, sudden swerves, dark humor and intriguing characters, make for a great blend that is entertaining from start to finish.  <br />
