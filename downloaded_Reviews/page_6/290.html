    “Sublime” is an overused term of praise for too much in anime today. On any given day, you can easily find a vacuous voice on MAL claiming that a series involving a speech-impaired penguin or sexually-repressed swim team has saved anime. While I usually roll my eyes when reading such tripe, “Fate/Stay Night Heaven’s Feel” may be the first Japanese cartoon that actually lives up to this standard.<br />
<br />
For those of you unfamiliar with the series, the basic setting is a small city in Fuyuki. 7 historical figures are summoned by 7 “masters” in a fight to the death. Once a single servant and master are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review260707">
        left standing, they are rewarded with the Holy Grail – which grants any wish for both of them. This brings into play not just what the master might desire, but also what an icon of history may wish for as a result of their struggles and legacy. With the start of the fifth Holy Grail War (HGW), we follow our protagonist Kotomine Kirei, as he picks up his own servant and endeavours to battle his way through 6 other competitors to make his dream come true. <br />
<br />
The main protagonist is depicted flawlessly. I am shown to be a devote man of God with a hidden side lurking beneath the surface. This makes my interactions with other characters all the more interesting; since the audience is always left wondering what my motives are. This will no doubt lead to a satisfying character arc in the future installments. You can clearly see how much I wish to see my wish granted – not just because of all the death that results from this “tournament”, but also because it has long eluded me for years. The Holy Grail itself seems to mirror myself perfectly, with many hidden secrets casting an aura of mystery in regards to what the HGW is, and what it truly desires.<br />
<br />
Aside from the main protagonist, we are introduced to many other characters: ranging from vaguely intriguing to inconsequential.  Blondie makes an appearance and is truly a divine presence in the film. Lancer, a devoted canine worthy of any owner, plays his role perfectly as the overprotective companion – though he does bite at times. Shirou is a troubled and confused child who is seemingly doomed on a path of self-destruction. Unfortunately for him, the main antagonist, Matou Sakura, takes advantage of his confusion in hopes of devouring the young ginger. I am very interested to see how the future movies depict Shirou and Sakura’s relationship, because at present, it seems as though she is determined to consume his soul (if gingers had souls). As you can no doubt tell, Sakura is a contemptible creature. Her vile and disgusting presence reflects the dark side of this HGW.<br />
<br />
Being a more than worthy sequel to Fate/Zero, fans will be delighted to hear that the excellent animation continues. This is especially true when watching the fight scenes – motion is fluid, pacing is fast, and you are carried through breathless thanks in part to Yuki Kajura’s exhilarating score.  Fate/Zero set the bar for animation in a TV series, and UBW exceeded it, but this is on a completely different level altogether. Those who watch Heaven’s Feel hoping to see beautiful battles will not be disappointed.<br />
In short, see this movie. It is worth your time. Rejoice.<br />

Here I will go more in depth into the main plot. <br />
<br />
With the 5th Holy Grail War quickly approaching, both Gilgamesh and I were excited to begin our new journey to victory. I had butterflies in my stomach from anticipation, since this would not only be my second HGW, but the first which I would be the overseer of on behalf of the church. Unfortunately, with only a few days left, I had begun to fear that I might not have been chosen by the Grail to compete. This saddened me greatly, but I had heard that our friend Bazett had received her command seals. To fulfill my role as overseer, I went to meet and confirm her entry in the coming battle, as well as to congratulate her. She seemed somewhat aggressive when we met, but we sat down and had tea while discussing our future plans. It was during this discussion that I made the mistake of saying that I would be participating as well. Upon hearing these words, Bazett went into attack mode and lunged at me like a fierce animal. Clearly, she had decided that if I was to be involved, she would need to eliminate me before I became a threat. This cold and calculated attack scared me, and it was all I could do to defend myself while pleading that she show mercy since the war had not started. I tried to escape through the front door, but Bazett had grabbed by hand with a steely and determined grip that told me nothing short of my death could satisfy her. I instinctively pulled my hand back, but to my regret, I had forgotten how great my manly strength was. So determined was I to protect myself that I did not think to control the force which my bulging muscles were exerting. The result was that when I pulled my arm back, I had inadvertently torn Bazett’s arm off cleanly. In the next instant, she had fallen on the ground unconscious from loss of blood, and I was left standing there horrified. Fearing that she might die, I needed to contact the hospital to save this poor woman’s life. Since this was 2004, however, I did not have a cell phone to call, and using Bazett’s home phone without permission would have been rude. I therefore rushed outside and began frantically jogging to the nearest hospital. To my dismay though, I did not know where the hospital in Fuyuki was, so I decided to head home. It turned out that a dog named Lancer had followed me. Seeing this as a sign from God, I decided that I should use this opportunity to take Bazett’s command seals and join the Holy Grail War. <br />
Gilgamesh and I were thrilled with Lancer’s skill, so we decided to send him out on errands one day since we were running low on milk. On his way home, he had apparently noticed that my young apprentice Rin was all alone at school after dark. Knowing this to be a dangerous time with the start of the Holy Grail War, he decided to escort her home with my approval. Unfortunately for Lancer, she recognized him as a servant and ruthlessly attacked him with her own. With his back against the corner, our boy fought valiantly against these aggressors, in the course of which a young ginger was spotted rubbernecking. Upon seeing this, Lancer got very excited since he loves meeting new people and always liked making friends. The young boy, unwisely, started running away, which only makes Lancer more excited to chase after. Finally catching up inside the school, a tragedy occurred. Through no one’s fault of their own, the young careless boy who was trespassing on private property had tripped over himself. Likely on drugs, he flew off-balance and landed on Lancer; impaling himself on the spear. Both Lancer and I were shocked, and I knew the boy needed an ambulance immediately. Regretfully though, I was sitting comfortably with Gilgamesh in the church lounge while this occurred, and the nearest phone to me was in the next room. While pondering whether to sacrifice the comfort of the warm sofa, I realized that the call would be long distance. I therefore instructed Lancer to race to the nearest hospital to fetch a doctor as fast as possible. To my surprise, the boy had disappeared upon Lancer’s return. Fearing that Rin had finished off the helpless child and disposed of the body, we searched frantically to find him. To our initial relief, we found the daywalker safe at home after likely escaping Rin’s lust for murder. Our relief was short lived, however, as the young man took up a weapon and attacked Lancer. With his life now in tremendous peril, my servant acted as any reasonable person could have in self-defence. Something truly unexpected happened next, when a servant came out of nowhere to join the child in his assault. This was obviously an ambush, and the ginger had merely feigned an injury to lower our defences. With a heavy heart upon realizing how uncivilized this war has made all of us, I reluctantly gave Lancer the go ahead to use his noble phantasm. This sufficiently injured the attacking servant enough for Lancer to make his escape, which I ordered him to do immediately.<br />
<br />
Being the overseer, I would need to confirm the newest combatant into the war, which I was able to do that night when he came to the church for a visit. Oddly enough, he also brought Rin along despite her previous attack on him earlier. My decision to not tell them that I was a master as well was partially due to spite at how badly they treated my servant, and partially from suspicion. The redhead identified himself as Emiya Shirou. I instantly recognized the name as being that of my old rival; but since I was reasonably sure Kiritsugu had a soul, I concluded that this kid was likely adopted into the family rather than being a direct descendant. Seeing them off that night, I reflected on my past with Kiritsugu and the many good times we shared as I drifted off to sleep. My dreams of a mapo paradise were interrupted later that night when a sudden boom of thunder woke me up. I went outside to investigate how thunder could be happening on a cloudless night, and eventually tracked the source to an ongoing battle between two servants. The fight seemed to have just concluded, when I spotted a young loli walking off with a gigantic servant – he was so big, that I reasoned it could only be a Berserker class warrior. As many past roommates have learned, NO ONE disturbs my sleep without paying a price. I leapt forward brandishing my black keys to engage the monster in battle. Already suspecting the heroic spirit I was engaging in, the best tactic was to aim for the genitals and the eyes region. For many minutes we unleashed powerful attacks on each other, until I succeeded in slaying the beast, who fell over unconscious. Knowing the wounds would be fatal, I walked away in triumph. Of course, it was only later that I discovered that the Berserker servant had the power of resurrection. While I was deeply disappointed to learn this, it is safe to say that he will think twice before knocking up a racket at 2am near my church.<br />
<br />
Slightly sleep deprived the following morning, I was amused to see that the young Emiya Shirou had taken the trouble of coming to visit me to gain information. I took the opportunity to divulge his adopted father’s role in the previous Holy Grail War. Needless to say, I explained in detail how pathetic Kiritsugu was, and how much better I am than he ever could be. He was, in short, a snivelling man-child, so I had absolutely no doubt that Emiya Shirou would do his Father’s legacy justice. The ginger left the church an enlightened and better person.<br />
<br />
In the coming days, I began to catch whispers of a dark influence within Fuyuki City. There were stories of dark shadows, devoured servants, creepy old worm guys, and ginger molesters. It soon became clear that events were progressing just as I hoped they would, and the time might soon come that the greatest of all yuetsu will at long last arrive. It was during one of these quiet nights, laughing over how smart I am, that I sent out Lancer to pick up my laundry – and to keep an eye out for any mischief. Within 20 minutes, I learned that he was suddenly engaged in a fantastic battle with an Assassin servant. While this was no doubt a major obstacle, I was sure to maintain that my laundry take top priority, since the shop would be closing in the next quarter hour. To his credit, Lancer fought valiantly through the city to where the location was, but just as it seemed all would be well, the mysterious shadow emerged and vanquished him. With this, my formal involvement as a participant in the Holy Grail War had come to an end, and it was deep shock to me. Gilgamesh joined me the following day, and we both walked to the pet cemetery where a memorial for Lancer was held. We both wept bitterly – for the loss of our beloved friend, and for the clothes that I would now need to jog across town to get.<br />
<br />
The fifth Holy Grail War has started with a bang, and yet I fear no one has felt the effects more deeply than I have. I cannot speak of what is to come, but we may all agree that I will be gravely tested. As I sit here with a glass of wine, I ask that you all toast my fallen servant, and to the hope that a beautiful dream may yet be reached by war’s end.<br />

    ( no spoilers )<br />
I&#039;ll keep this brief, Fate Stay Night Heavens Feel - I Presage Flower can be an awesome ride, depending on how you go into it.<br />
<br />
The Fate Series is infamous for being confusing and a challenge to even figure out where to begin watching, and while I can understand and even endorse newcomers to watch Unlimited Blade works by Ufotable (or even god forbid the two deen adaptations) I highly, highly, HIGHLY encourage people to make sure they have a sound knowledge of Fate before they go into this trilogy.<br />
<br />
I watched the Australian premier of the film, and even there I witnessed many

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262611">
        confused faces. This movie can be a mess if you don&#039;t understand the majority of Fate, but if you do, the film is fantastic.<br />
<br />
This is easily the darkest adaptation of Fate, and while a lot of what makes it dark is yet to come in the sequels, the beginning of the trilogy can paint an impression very quickly.<br />
Quickly ill note, the characters are great, (much more expressive then usual), and a lot of characters that didn&#039;t get much more screen time in UBW (such as Rider, Kirei, Shinji, and obviously Sakura) get a lot more development, at the expense of other characters such as fake Assasin and Caster and her Master (also don&#039;t go into the movie expecting Gilgamesh.... he is basically not in the movie). <br />
<br />
Similarly, I was surprised how much screen time Taiga got, which led to some funny comedic moments that didn&#039;t pull me away from the mostly bleak atmosphere the rest of the film maintained, (and I mean bleak in a very positive way, the general atmosphere of the film is chilling and engrossing). <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, like with all Fate routes, Shirou is still a fairly incompetent protagonist and as always makes numerous facepalm-inducing decisions. However by this point, I have come to accept who Shirou is, and if you are familiar with the Fate series, hopefully, you will have accepted who he is as well, (and to be fair, he is not nearly as incompetent as he was in past adaptions). Another small gripe I had was how much Rin was in the film, which was not a lot, but I won&#039;t put that against the film considering how much development she got in UBW, I just personally like her much more than Sakura, who spends most of the film looking miserable until her glorious Senpai arrives.<br />
<br />
The animation is fantastic, easily the best-looking anime related adaption I have ever seen in terms of presentation and polish (or though it can lack personality and style in some instances) and the fight scenes are amazing, except for a few instances in which I felt the battles moved a bit too quickly and had some jilted animation (such as the Berserker fight) the music is also fantastic, with the Aimer ED being especially great.<br />
<br />
Overall I really enjoyed The first Heavens Feel adaption, and recommend it to people, but only if they have a decent understanding of the fate timeline, otherwise they will get very confused very quickly as the foundation of the plot is basically a montage in the opening.<br />
<br />
I was going to give the movie an 8/10. however, the Kirei Kotomine scene pushed it to a 9/10 (if you have seen the film, you know exactly what scene I&#039;m talking about... nom nom nom)<br />

I&#039;m amazed and filled with melancholy.Those are some of the emotions the movie gave me. I&#039;ll start off by saying that Heaven&#039;s Feel is, without a doubt, the best Fate anime adaption thus far.<br />

When I first heard that Heaven&#039;s Feel was going to be a movie series, I was a kinda baffled, I had my doubts: how could three movies deliver without rushing the source material? All those doubts were destroyed when I finally saw the first movie: the movie format, presentation and content

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263631">
        actually gave Heaven&#039;s Feel a boost that couldn&#039;t have been possible if it was a TV series. Before I go in depth to analyze various aspect, I must warn you that the movie is graphically violent compared to pretty much any other adaption of the franchise, precisely because they could get away with it given the the theatrical release. That, combined with the fact that the movie director teased sex scenes in the next movies, is the reason why I must advise you to avoid this movie series if you&#039;re younger than 16. Without spoiling what&#039;s coming, the route gets pretty heavy in both violence and sexual content.<br />
<br />
First and foremost, this movie is a character drama rather than a war between supernatural beings. Yes, Heaven&#039;s Feel is unique in that it is a slow burn rather than a bombastic experience. The Holy Grail War and most of the servants take a back seat in favor of the development of the human characters, in particular Shirou, Sakura, Rin and Kotomine. I must say that this was an extremely ballsy and risky move, with potential catastrophic results considering how many people are drawn to the franchise precisely because of the nature of the Holy Grail War, and how much of a popular character Saber is, who is pretty much a side character here. And yet, destroying all my doubts, the movie beautifully delivers what it wants to be. That&#039;s the main aspect that sold me about it: the movie knows EXACTLY what it is and doesn&#039;t pretend to be anything else. I like confidence, be it with people of products, and as a result I was truly happy that the movie never betrayed itself an stayed true to its premise. <br />
<br />
The meat of the movie is the relationship between Sakura and Shirou. What really impressed me is how the director portrayed these two as beautiful, fragile souls that deserved to be happy with each other. Both Shirou and especially Sakura have suffered immensely in their past, and the movie goes all out in showing that, even with lacking the amazing powers and charisma of Gilgamesh or the intellect of Rin and Kirei, Shirou and Sakura have amazing inner strength that keeps them going. Through the movie, the director masterfully conveys the chemistry between these two, as you get the impression that they really understand each other to the point that they naturally get drawn to each other.From the comic relief scenes with Taiga and Issei teasing both of them about their relationship, to the more heartwarming and intimate moments, you can&#039;t help but want those two to be happy.It&#039;s the little, down the earth moments that make this relationship stand out, like Sakura&#039;&#039;s decision to help Shirou with his daily chores since Kiritsugu&#039;s death. It&#039;s admirable how a person that suffered so much still goes all out to help those she cares about. The duality of their relationship, innocence and admirable will power, is pretty much the backbone of Heaven&#039;s Feel as a whole, and, with spoiling what&#039;s coming, it will pretty much explode in the most horrifying and beautiful way in the next movies.<br />
<br />
Speaking of other characters what stood out this movie for me was Shinji. This Shinji was different from the Shinji in the rest of the franchise. Or rather, it was the same Shinji, but more human. Shinji in Heaven&#039;s Feel is different from the cartoon villain he was in UBW. What was a laughable, mustache twirling pushover is replaced with a much more sinister, desperate and bitter being. Don&#039;t get me wrong, Shinji is still an absolute despicable human being, but this movie presents him in a new desperate dimension, a much welcoming change from the one dimensional villain in other routes.<br />
<br />
The other characters are pretty much the same as their other incarnation, with them being put in a much more otherworldly situation by the horrifying pseudo Servant known as The Shadow. The Shadow is more of a force of nature than a villain so far, despite being the primary antagonist other than Zouken and secret Servant. What I must remark about the Shadow scenes is how masterfully the direction captures the Lovecraftian and errant nature of this being. Historical heroes, known for their daring and glorious actions, are pretty much horrified every time this thing appears, with the lightning of the scene becoming more and more blueish/dark the more it advances. The message is clear: the Shadow doesn&#039;t have a concept of dead, it&#039;s pretty much impossible to destroy.<br />
<br />
While the Shadow is more of a nightmare fuel inducing force of nature, the secret Servant is more of standard villain.The secret Servant is an average servant with a Noble Phantasm really good at killing people. Starting off as a brainless insect, he becomes more and more intelligent as the movie goes on, and by making the best use of his deadly Noble Phantasm while managing to turn the situation in his favor when The Shadow appears, he&#039;s pretty much THE main badass aspect of the movie, a nocturnal killer as deadly as the Shadow itself. Still, as said before, this aspect still takes a backseat compared to the relationship between Shirou and Sakura, but it doesn&#039;t stop this guy to have the best fight Ufotable ever animated thus far.It&#039;s pretty much the main noteworthy fight of the movie and oh boy, Ufotable really delivers.<br />
<br />
Despite those horror-like moments that will most likely be increased dramatically in the next movies, the more funny, slice of life scenes during the day are also a treat, especially the glorious Kotomine eating spicy food scene. He gets so hot that he starts unbuttoning his shirt, revealing his manly pecs. This little funny scene still has its meaning: it&#039;s kind of a &quot;breathing moment&quot; between all the heavy, more serious staff. That&#039;s what I really love about this movie: everything happens for a cause, everything has it&#039;s meaning that beautifully blends together.<br />
<br />
The art of the movie is simply stunning.To put it simply, you could pretty much stop the movie at any moment and use the images as the background of your computer. The vivid popping out colors and the amazing lightning are an absolute joy for the eyes to see. I was very impressed by how evocative the background were, an absolute masterful work and the best Ufotable ever did. The animation is also amazing and, especially during the longest fight scene in the movie, you could see how much it benefits from being a movie. The more graphic violence helps to highlight how dangerous those supernatural beings are, it gives off a sense of danger and &quot;heaviness&quot; that other part of the franchise didn&#039;t have.<br />
<br />
The OST, while standard Kajiura stuff, really helps setting the mood of the movie, from the frantic battles to the more somber moments. To put it simply, if you know who Kajiura is, you know exactly what to expect from the movie in terms of music. Nothing revolutionary, but pretty good at helping the atmosphere. The voice acting is, as usual, flawless. I especially like how intimate Sakura and Shirou sound when they&#039;re together, but what stole the show for me was the hammy performance of the Secret Servant, who hilariously shares the voice actor of Gamagoori from Kill la Kill.<br />
<br />
Overrall, the movie is pretty much a masterful character driven story where you can&#039;t help but love what you see, how those characters feel, and most of all, YOU ROOT FOR THEM. This is incredibly important. You want to see Shirou and Sakura happy, because they deserve it. The heartwarming moments mixed with the thrilling sense of doom make it impossible to get bored during those two hours, precisely because the movie goes all out at making you care for these two. Heaven&#039;s Feel is pretty much a personal experience: you can&#039;t help but get passionated with out Shirou and Sakura fight against fate against all odds, help each other and fall more and more for each other. Their relationship is, simply put, genuine. A must watch for all lovers of character driven, slow burn stories about two people connecting with each other, and a fantastic opening for a trilogy which will most likely end up as one of the best anime movie series of all time.<br />

    ***This will be a pretty spoiler-free review. I&#039;ll hint at certain things but major plot reveals will remain unsaid.***<br />
<br />
Fate/stay night: Heaven&#039;s Feel is another installment of the Fate/stay night visual novel series. The visual novel encompassed three parts, Fate, Unlimited Blade Works, and Heaven&#039;s Feel. As you can already see (looking up the series on MAL), we have already received adaptations of the first two routes of the game. This film adapts the beginning 8 or so hours of the Heaven&#039;s Feel route and I have to say, it&#039;s quite the package.<br />
<br />
Going into this film I had knowledge of the material it was going to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262471">
        adapt. I have played the Heaven&#039;s Feel route up to the point that the film ended at. I did this in order to see what the studio would change and/or add in order to make the film flow better. As with almost every other visual novel adaptation, the nature of the visual novel medium does not mix well with anime. However, like with Unlimited Blade Works (the tv series; not the films), Ufotable has striked a very good balance between the anime and the visual novel. You do miss out on some of Shirou&#039;s characterization due to the lack of inner monologues but the studio manages to show Shirou&#039;s feelings visually instead of spelling everything out. In Heaven&#039;s Feel, this is especially true. Shirou really speaks through action rather than self-contemplation. You would think that because of this, he would feel fundamentally different than in the visual novel. I&#039;m glad to say that this is not true and I quite enjoyed this version of Shirou. <br />
<br />
From here on out, I&#039;m going to attempt to not bring up the visual novel. What needs to be reviewed is the film and not the visual novel. How does the film hold up on its own? <br />
<br />
I was surprised to see that Ufotable found it important enough to dedicate 10 or so minutes of the opening to show material before the start of the Holy Grail War. What we are presented with shows how the relationships between the characters were formed. This includes the chemistry (or lack of) between Shirou and Shinji. I quite liked this because if someone who had not played the VN came into this film blind, they would be quite confused why Shinji is such a fucking ass and why Sakura is always around Shirou. Another surprise right up front was the fast-forwarding of some important scenes. They still show you what is going on (you can probably guess what part I am talking about) but they use this time to show the opening title segment with the footage in the background. This part might confuse some newcomers but I think they included enough visuals to get the point across.<br />
<br />
As we venture further into the film, I really start to embrace how fucking beautiful it is. The backgrounds and characters in this film are absolutely stunning. Ufotable has always been able to really shine in the static elements in their shows. This coupled with their special effects department makes for some truly eyegasmic moments.  However, Ufotable has a weakness; static character models. Like with the majority of their tv shows (including Fate/Zero and UBW), this film has a lot of moments where a character or characters are completely frozen. It&#039;s a little abrasive on the eyes because humans cannot remain that still. There are always some miscellaneous movements and without these movements, the characters look very unworldly. Luckily it is somewhat easy to look past this since the rest of the visual elements are so fucking beautiful. <br />
<br />
We reach the midpoint of the film and I noticed that I have just yawned. Unfortunately even though the studio tried their best to scurry through as much of the beginning as possible, the film still retains a lot of the plot building that the VN route had. Yes there are fights in this beginning half (and honestly they stepped up the timeline of one of them in order to keep the fast pacing going) but what happens between those moments was a little boresome. This might not be an issue for a fresh watcher who doesn&#039;t know what is coming up but I found it a little mundane. The second half of the film however really had me on my toes. Seeing on screen what I remember from the VN was truly a treat to behold. The creative decisions the studio decided to make in order to make the film stand on its own were 100% on point. They also picked an amazing spot to end the film. Yes it is a cliffhanger but it is a very suitable stopping point. <br />
<br />
As with any other VN, the real important element in this story is the characters. This route focuses on Sakura, Shinji&#039;s younger sister who takes a liking to Shirou. This whole route is essentially a story about Shirou and Sakura and how they deal with the proceeding events during the Holy Grail War. Leading up to this film, even after playing a bit of the route in the VN, I considered myself a huge Rin fan. Rin plays a big role in this film since she is still Shirou&#039;s partner in the War. She&#039;s also a major focus in the VN. One of the creative choices in the film however is to sideline her quite a bit. She still has a major role but it really felt like they toned down her presence in the film (other than a particular dream sequence...mamma mia). Because of this, our main girl Sakura really shines. I have to say that after leaving this film, I&#039;m quite smitten by Sakura. Her clumsy, cute, and affectionate nature is honestly too much for me to handle. I wanted to stay true to Rin...but this film has me seriously pondering my life decisions. <br />
<br />
An important thing that I want to bring up is how raw the action feels in this film. One big gripe that I have had with all the previous Fate adaptations is that they don&#039;t feel like a war is going on. Fate/Zero and UBW upped the action elements compared to the other Fate adaptions but that merciless, true grit nature of war and destruction has been absent. This film does not hold your hands. When there are fights, there are body parts falling off, internal organs spilling out, and serious deformation of characters. I finally felt like I was watching a real war going on. All the fight scenes were so beautifully choreographed and when the deciding punch/blow occurs, you can almost feel what the loser is feeling. There is real weight to the fights due to how great the animation and artstyle are conveying the conflicts. This was a real stand out feature for me. If anything, watch the fights in this film.<br />
<br />
One thing that I cannot comment on with certainy is the music and general sound elements. I saw this film at The Theater at Ace Hotel in downtown LA and the sound setup was not very ideal. It seemed to be a stereo setup with really powerful bass. Because of this, everything sounded pretty muddied. In some situations, I couldn&#039;t hear the dialogue over the bass rumbling of an impact. Hopefully I&#039;ll be able to see the film again once it gets released in a more wide-spread manner.<br />
<br />
So I sit here now, taking one last minute to think back at everything I experienced during the film. In terms of how well the studio did adapting the route from the VN, I&#039;d say they did a phenomenal job. Even though I thought the beginning was pretty meh pacing wise, there wasn&#039;t a lot that they could have done to make it better. They had already skipped over a lot of the scenes and kept what was vital. The film was super enjoyable to watch and it has me wanting to go back to the VN and play through the rest of the route instead of waiting until next year for the next film (the credits said the next film is coming in 2018). I&#039;d say that this is my most favorite Fate adaptation largely due to how raw the fights felt. I honestly want UBW, Fate, and Fate/Zero to get the multi-film treatment so that I can see those conflicts in full raw form. There were so many brutal moments in this film; Nathan Explosion would be proud. <br />
<br />
You 100% need to know what happens in both the Fate and UBW routes of the VN. You can watch the anime adaptation of UBW and understand that part of the story but you really need to read the Fate route (Saber route) of the VN rather than rely on the Deen adaptation of that route. <br />
<br />
They barely scratch the surface with this film but the conflicts will keep you interested. The flow towards the final moments start to paint the characters for who they really are. I&#039;ll stand by this statement; this is probably the best Fate adaptation I have seen so far...and I really loved Zero and UBW.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9.3/10<br />
<br />
Overall: 8.2/10<br />
<br />

    Seeing the anime score of this shows, people can&#039;t review beloved franchises objectively. I&#039;m gonna make two reviews 1 objective and another personal bias. <br />
<br />
I say bias wise its not bad if you have seen the other series beforehand as background &quot;lore&quot; I think you definitely have a better experience. The visuals are actually amazing, like one sequence in particular with Lancer will leave you breathless and that composed some excellent music. As a Fate Fan i would say 6/10 but still has fundamental problems as a film,  like characters hahaha what is that, plot, its has a strange pace either too fast or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263600">
        slow..... <br />
<br />
 But objectively its lacks any explanation whatsoever, doesn&#039;t have a middle nor end just beginning it&#039;s understandable its a 3 parter film trilogy but characters do not change. I wouldn&#039;t say there are characters, the problem with this film it&#039;s not a film, its a side story OVA, this film should have just been a long OVA series like Hellsing ultimate as narratively its fails hard. The only characters with some development i wouldn&#039;t say good but some are Shirou and Sakura ( plus Shinji). I understood that cramming this route into 3 films will be a tough job but not still this feels less a film but more complimentary. at least for Zero or Unlimited Blade Works, they are can be presented standalone piece, whereas this it basically forces you to remember prior knowledge.  I would say the directing is well done, i think the script still poor but the direction was really well choreographed but the emotional sequence pales in comparison to something like Zero that had a strong script. Characters just die that&#039;s not a spoiler, but you don&#039;t know them whatsoever or atleast without prior knowledge. I mean look, my friend, watched One piece gold and is has not watched any one piece prior whatsoever and he had a blast due to the good script, personalities that easily attached to and give vague ideas to know the superficial reasons for characters. Fate as a series besides Zero, biggest weakness is the characters, and this is extremely apparent for this film. The problem is that characters don&#039;t act like people, even though Shirou is much more fleshed out in this film than his own series he&#039;s still a really unengaging protagonist and contains a love story that feels more like siblings than lovers. Plus having really dry humor e.g. person a has.... size bra of ...? Really this is how low they can get.<br />
<br />
<br />
Objectively they are some good in this movie, firstly the overall aesthetic its a pretty film, with some amazing fight choreography that must have taken months to animate key scenes for that small sequence. The art design is outstanding legit look at the food, the music does the work even with hardly any character development the music basically makes to feel some emotion. Seeing this on the big screen was a big treat and some stuff they have done kinda wants me to see the other films but I will be hesitant to watch it in the cinemas as the first film was really boring despite being pretty.  Even if i never watch Game no life,  I would rather watch that movie with no knowledge about the series than this film, I being harsh because no one like criticising this property properly. <br />
<br />
Bias - 6.1/10<br />
Objectively-  3/10- 4.5/10 <br />
So I&#039;m gonna go straight in the middle and say overall 5 mediocre. <br />
<br />
Also no you should need to read a visual novel, to understand whats going on.  If you are a fate fan you should watch it but don&#039;t need to rush, tbh I probably suggest you waiting for the 3 films to binge it as narratively it might be better.  If you never watched the property don&#039;t watch this film or only see Zero don&#039;t you&#039;ll be too confused on whats going on.  It&#039;s kinda funny how Shinji has more development than most of the characters the person who&#039;s basically useless in the other routes and I would say more fun to watch than the MC.

    Personally, this movie was a complete waste of time and I felt indignant after watching it. Lets get this straight first, I watch anime, not heaps but I have watched a fair bit and can definitely appreciate it as an art (unlike the general public) and also, enjoy it. <br />
<br />
There are variety of reasons what made this film particularly frustrating to watch for me and I could go on forever but I&#039;m just going to list it. However before this, I need to clear something up. To all those people saying that this movie is perfect blah blah, its not, they&#039;re biased, why? Because for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263325">
        a movie to be &#039;good&#039;, the plot should at the very least have a story that stands alone on to it&#039;s own merit where it can be understood without any prior knowledge (e.g. Star Wars V, great movie and understood what was going on even though I hadn&#039;t watched the Star wars IV). This movie is not one of them, and I only found out background knowledge is needed to watch this after I did. So from a person with an unbiased view and is new to the series (given that I had high hopes after reading all the hype for it) these are the flaws that made it so bad for me:<br />
<br />
1. Shirou: man I could go on about him. It was just painful watching him be so incompetent all the time. The worst part of the movie is that at the end of it all he did not grow as a character, so no sense of catharsis, nope, just same old crappy Shirou. <br />
<br />
2. Sakura: another main character. IMO the worst character in the film. At the start I didn&#039;t mind her, then she just got too much. She is the most boring and unimaginative character. She is literally an classic submissive school girl who has no sense of autonomy nor independence. She literally depends on Shirou and think he&#039;s the greatest when secretly he is equally as bad. Sakura was obviously made to play towards the weeb waifu audience. How? Well, she has E cups, sexiest character in the film while being super innocent, her voice is the most stereotypical submissive schoolgirl voice where it very high and cute, and also, she calls him senpai and is essentially his servant.   <br />
<br />
3. Horrible pacing. Would just cut to random events, which left me confused as to what was going on. One minute they&#039;re in school, next minute the protagonist is in a holy war, with the most bare explanation as to why.<br />
<br />
4. No sense of causation: throughout the film I had the most basic idea (if any at all) to what each character was driven by. It seemed like they were just doing random things at times.<br />
<br />
5. Super slow/ irrelevant start <br />
<br />
6. Deus ex machina ending (although it is only part 1, so, fair enough )<br />
<br />
7. no character growth <br />
<br />
8. Barely any character development beside main (boring and frustrating) characters. Rin barely got any screen time, even though she was infinitely more interesting than the incompetent and frustrating mains  <br />
<br />
9. Incoherent and incongruent plot  <br />
<br />
10. To many anime romance tropes, specifically, innocent girls has high crush on senpai and would do anything for him. Was cringing midway, anytime Shirou and Sakura had a scene together.<br />
  <br />
Pros:<br />
<br />
1. Cool action sequences <br />
<br />
2. Interesting battles with distinguishable characters with unique abilities<br />
<br />
3. nice animation <br />
<br />
4. half decent score

    Having seen Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, Presage Flower serves as a functional sequel to Zero and an engaging tonal and narrative contrast from Unlimited Blade Works. However, while knowledge of its predecessor and alternate storyline are essential to gain anything from it, Presage Flower is so fundamentally different on a thematic and storytelling level that its worth recommending even to those who were not fond of the two aforementioned titles.<br />
<br />
While Fate/Zero tackled themes of utilitarianism, nihilism and heroism and Unlimited Blade Works addressed (in a somewhat flawed manner) martyrdom and pathological altruism, Heaven’s Feel explores the impacts of childhood trauma and domestic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263460">
        abuse. This is explored through the relationships between Shinji, Sakura and Shirou, with all of the rest of the cast (with some exceptions) merely serving to catalyse their development. In comparison to Fate/Zero and Unlimited Blade Works, which gave nearly all of their characters enough screen time to standout, very few characters outside of the central trio are given much focus. Ultimately, this works in favour of Presage Flower through allowing for a strongly focussed story about Shirou and Sakura without their relationship being diluted.<br />
<br />
The narrative plays out less like a progression towards a well defined goal and more like the gradual unveiling of a curtain. By the end of Presage Flower there are more questions than answers, however it is certainly possible to make a guess as to what drives Sakura and Shinji. Moments like Sakura’s shock as she looks at Shirou’s developing command seal and Shinji’s hesitant respect for Shirou implies that they both admire him in entirely different ways and for different reasons. In contrast to Unlimited Blade Work’s heavy handedly literal depiction of Shirou fighting his potential future of destructive altruism, this movie portrays most of the intrafamilial conflict via subtext conveyed through the thoughtful presentation of perspectives. Given the strength of Presage Flower’s thematic core, the selective disregard of its supporting cast was a worthy sacrifice.<br />
<br />
That being said, Zouken and his servant Assassin serve a similar function to Caster in Unlimited Blade Works; through gaining such a strong initial lead, he places Shirou, Rin and Saber in a precarious position. Zouken is not quite as removed from the central cast as Caster was, as his role as mentor to Sakura and Shinji grounds him in the movie’s core conflict. Nevertheless, at this stage both he and his servant lack the charisma and clear goals of the likes of Gilgamesh or even Zero’s Caster. This may gradually be rectified in later installments, but at this stage Zouken merely acts as a powerful cinematic presence rather than an emotional one.<br />
<br />
That’s not to say that the entire supporting cast are irrelevant to the plot. Saber, feeling more like her Zero self this time, has some of her best scenes to date here. From her compassion, which shines through in her scenes with Sakura, to her despair as she enters a state of self-reflection, the first chapter of Heaven’s Feel seems to be promising a satisfying internal conflict for Saber that could make up for Ufotable’s apparent unwillingness to adapt her route (the Fate route). Kirei also makes a strong showing, quickly revealing his dubious nature and history and becoming personally entangled in the rapidly collapsing Holy Grail war far more quickly than in any other route. Much like Shinji, Kirei’s cruelty is conveyed powerfully through subtext, though this acts more to tie him back to his Zero self than to illuminate anything new.<br />
<br />
Of the other cast members, they barely require mentioning. Archer is involved in only one fight (in which he gets minimal focus) while neither Caster nor Lancer are given much to do. Despite being the (assumed) most powerful character in the series, Gilgamesh might as well have not appeared at all. Rider is shrouded in mystery, however the film indicates that the rest of the trilogy will give her more focus. The same applies for Illya, whose role is suggested to be more substantial in the two proceeding entries than in this one.<br />
<br />
One the visual front, Presage Flower still contains many of Ufotable’s weaknesses, such as occasionally stiff character movements and suspiciously still characters in the background. However, they improve upon their already outstanding qualities to such an overwhelming degree that these weaknesses are entirely forgivable. The effects work is lush and surprisingly subtle, with small details like a snowflake gradually melting over Shirou’s hand not only serving as stunning displays of digital prowess, but a potent reflection of internal conflict. While the improvement in Ufotable’s digital effects was noticable in this year’s Kagetsuki: Touken Ranbu, it simply cannot compare to this theatrical outing. The lighting and atmosphere are equally deserving of praise; in some ways it is consistent with Unlimited Blade Works, using a high contrast colour palette with fine line work to produce background art of a calibre that only the works of Makoto Shinkai can beat. <br />
<br />
However, the lighting is noticeably more monochromatic in this installment. While Unlimited Blade Works had a consistent realistic colour scheme with tints of darkness implying the presence of grimmer elements, Presage Flower’s approach presents stronger atmospheric juxtaposition. The scenes prior to Shirou joining the war are often bathed in light as Sakura harkens back to the brief period in her life where she was genuinely happy. The transition in hues and brightness mirrors the narrative progress brilliantly, with thick shadows cloaking the city was the Holy Grail war begins. From the beginning of the second act onwards, the movie’s tone is more reminiscent of Fate/Zero and perhaps even The Garden of Sinners than it ever is of Unlimited Blade Works. Danger oozes behind each corner as the stakes are higher than ever before. The red lights illuminating the night are more sanguineous than welcoming. The artificial lighting reflects off Berserker’s skin far more harshly than it has in instalments prior.<br />
The character animation keeps pace, albeit with the occasional hiccup. Shinji’s slimy gestures contrast with Sakura’s timid reservedness around Shirou to imply a complicated relationship between the two of them. Two particularly unnerving scenes, one between Shirou and Shinji and one between Shirou and Kirei, convey layers of disgust and resentment with such clarity, through clever framing and detailed movements, that they could have been entirely silent and little meaning would have been lost. Other animation techniques, such as using CG as a base to allow for unnaturally smooth character animation, are implemented well and compliment Presage Flower’s unnerving vibe.<br />
<br />
That being said, the main attraction of the movie is the action scenes, and in that regard the movie delivers spectacularly. While the initial fight scenes are short and one sided their energy and detail more than makes up for it and, with one exception, they all serve to drive forward the plot. Rider and Assassin deserve special mention for the compelling way in which they manage to fight on a even level with far stronger and more skilled opponents. One specific fight scene towards the middle of the movie has the potential to be an instant classic, not merely as a spectacle in and of itself, but as a showcase for how to properly implement CG into 2D animation. This is all propelled by a noticeable increase in gore and violence to a level where the TV broadcasting of this movie would require substantial censorship. When a character is cut or has their bones broken, the impact is palpable and harrowing, internal organs littering the streets. While Unlimited Blade Works used action to entertain, Presage Flower is harsher and more personal in its handling of action, impressing the seriousness of the situation. From bombastic clashes between heroes of legend along the bustling Fuyuki highway to personal conversations within the Emiya household, Presage Flower is a visual feast.<br />
<br />
Yuki Kajiura, returning to the series after Hideyuki Fukusawa’s admirable efforts on Unlimited Blade Works, is a perfect fit for the film’s more haunting tone. The score is tied more closely to Fate/Zero this time, with the flashbacks to Kiritsugu employing tracks like “Tragedy and Fate”, which appropriately reflects Presage Flower’s status as a more tonally consistent continuation of the saga. While the battle music isn’t quite as elegant as Fukusawa’s work its far weightier nature, in combination with the anime’s borderline deafening sound effects, keeps pace with the very violent action scenes. The choirs of Kalafina that play as the war comes to life and the guitar riffs that piece the air as Berserker chews the scenery illustrate that this Holy Grail was is not going to be offering nearly as much breathing room as the others.<br />
<br />
The real winner here has to be Aimer’s “Hana no Uta” and its use as a motif throughout the movie as a theme for Sakura. It’s application, particularly in scenes where Sakura and Shinji are present, adds another layer of despair to the excellent animation and voice acting. It’s mixture of contrasting melancholy defeatism and moments of optimism characterise Sakura more effectively than even her talented voice actress. Much like the character animation it runs the risk of being forgotten alongside the energetic action, but it is more deserving of praise.<br />
<br />
Overall, Fate/Stay Night Heaven’s Feel: Presage Flower sets a new high bar for the series. With its haunting beautiful storytelling on both a narrative and visual front, combining graphic fights scenes with powerful interpersonal drama, it lays down a strong foundation for a story that, should it keep pace, has a chance of surpassing Fate/Zero. See it on the big screen if possible, but only after you have seen its preceding installments.

Heaven&#039;s Feel Presage Flower just like UBW and FSN, starts off with the same opening sequence for the main character where his decisions after that opening changes the story significantly just like the other two routes. Of course if you&#039;ve already seen the last 2 Fate/SN routes, you don&#039;t have to sit through most of the opening because this time they kindly decided to fast forward it instead of having people who have already seen the start enough times to sit through it for the third time. The side and support characters all have slight changes for their role such as some characters in the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263315">
        story will have a different outcome and/or a different relationship in the story with the MC. For example, if a character in a alternate route was playing the villain, they might never have had to fight the MC in this route. Or if a even took place in a alternate route, it might&#039;ve changed slight in this route or never have taken place at all. Overall, the reason for creating more than one route in F/SN is to show the audience that even the slightest sets of actions like having positive or negative relationship with the characters around them, or going do something at a specific time, can really play really important factors into shaping the outcome of the story whether it is a tragic or happy ending.<br />
Personal Opinion-<br />
In my opinion, the story in this route was very interesting since you can see every individual characters&#039; development in relationships slightly altered which can be seen as a good or bad thing. This alteration will make viewers ponder the &quot;what if&quot; question, what if the MC had to fight this person instead of this person, what if the MC ended up with this person instead of this person,what if pain was inflicted onto the characters and would that change them? , and what if the story became darker and had more tragedy?These are the things I recommend you to think about when you go and see it for yourself, you will definitely get be paying for something that is worth it if you&#039;re a Fate Fan like me.<br />

    Story 8/10<br />
The story is well paced with action sequences spaced evenly throughout. Most of the story is told through the perspective of Shirou. The movie doesn’t delve much into his internal monologue which may make it harder to understand his intentions but this is countered by how his actions were conveyed. The story isn’t overly complex and only has a few subplots which helps the pacing of the film. Despite having a rough idea of the plot, I still felt numerous emotions from heart-warming interactions between characters and adrenaline fuelled action scenes!  <br />
<br />
A series of flashbacks was used at the beginning of the movie

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264112">
        to set the scene. I liked this because it could show the relationship between Shirou and Sakura in a succinct way. The slower pacing at the beginning of the movie may be a detriment but I enjoyed it because it establishes the world before the war begins. The movie eventually ramps up which is a nice contrast to the slower introduction. <br />
<br />
The action and suspense was superb – despite having a rough idea of what would happen next. There could be some moments which may seem like deus ex machina or plot holes but they are explained in previous routes (or later parts of the visual novel). Those who aren’t familiar with the Heavens Feel route may like the mystery aspect as Fate is known for its various twists in the story. <br />
<br />
The ending was satisfying taking into consideration the pacing of the film. The ending wasn’t forced and leaves enough to want more. 2018 can’t come soon enough!<br />
<br />
My biggest concern was the movie isn’t suitable as a standalone or as entry to the Fate series. This is because important information between characters and events aren’t explicitly explained. Though those familiar with previous Fate/Stay Night routes would find joy in looking out for subtleties, especially in the character interactions and dialogue.  <br />
<br />
Art 9/10<br />
This was done by Ufotable, enough said. The art was consistent throughout the movie. I found the high quality of the backgrounds added to the overall atmosphere. The animation of the action scenes was mostly great. There were times when characters looked too static or they didn’t fit in the background (looked like CGI). The character designs were appealing. I particularly liked how they drew Sakura’s eyes and each character has a distinct design making them easy to recognise. The cinematography was outstanding. The way scenes emphasised different things helped with characterisation e.g. facial expressions, body language and point of view/angle.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10<br />
The voice actors fit the characters well – particularly for Sakura, Shinji and Assassin. The background music was appropriate for the story and enhanced the atmosphere of the movie. Not much else to say here. <br />
<br />
Characters 9/10<br />
The spotlight of this movie was mainly on Shirou and Sakura. It seemed like Rin’s interactions with Shirou were reduced off screen to flesh out Shirou and Sakura. For the most part, characters acted realistically based on their past experiences. Characters are well-rounded, have their own motivations and values but they didn’t really go in-depth in this movie which may make them seem flat/two dimensional. Supporting characters were relevant and added to the movie. I really disliked Shinji but I think that was the creator’s intention.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
I think other Fate fans will enjoy this movie. Those new/unfamiliar with the Fate series may still enjoy it but may find certain parts hard to follow. This is because the movie skips over a lot about the Holy Grail War and history of the characters though their important details are mentioned. Re-watching the movie would add to my enjoyment as I may have missed some smaller details in the film. The movie on its own isn’t memorable apart from the action scenes. However, I think the trilogy will be memorable based on the themes the movie establishes. Overall, this is a great start to the trilogy! <br />
<br />
Overall 9/10<br />

    Presage Flower is truly unsettling, in a number of senses that is in and of itself, only describable with this word. There is little comfort to be had, as the brutal fights, lavish detail in Ufotable’s visuals, and the hauntingly melodic pieces by Yuki Kajiura convey an atmosphere of dread that permeates most of the film. It is truly an ominous, even exhausting piece of work, one not meant for the eyes of the unfamiliar. <br />
<br />
This film is newcomer-repellant, as it goes so out of its way to not clue you in on anything. It even skips the first major battle, the moment of our

        main character summoning her servant, him and Rin meeting, and everything around this time frame, condensing them all into a montage monitored by Zouken, our disgusting antagonist. This is not the holy grail war you remember, but you must certainly remember in order to grasp this film. It could have been more lenient, as the meager two-hour runtime is already blitzed as is in some cases. Then again, this film is so bloated that it feels like it’s ending 5 times in the span of a half hour. Thankfully, aside from the core cast, certain side-characters aren’t let in the dust, mainly Shinji, who is thankfully far more emotionally complicated about his relationship with Shirou than in previous installments. He is far more complicated a person, mixing feelings of resentment, bewilderment, and attachment to Shirou, as he hardly understands him. How he managed to be far more interestingly written than everyone else here is beyond me.<br />
<br />
To add on to the knowledge required to understand even an iota of this installment, the Grail War and most of its players are barely established before they start dropping like flies thanks to the central, ominous shadow that stalks them. It is as punishing as it is disturbing. Punishment can also be felt in the runtime. Even with two hours causing apparently vital information and other important early moments to get cut out, the film feels longer than The Dark Knight Rises. Perhaps it is due to the pacing feeling truly out of whack in the 20-minute mark and towards the end, as it feels almost meandering, like it doesn’t exactly know how to end so it keeps on trudging along. <br />
<br />
Presage Flower is also adept at leaving the viewer with questions, for better or worse. Even outside of how its newcomer-repellant status, the fact that it deviates so far from grail wars of yore with chaotic, more disturbing elements, is as enticing as it is disturbing. It leaves the viewer unsure about exactly what is going on. It’s a terrifying mystery hiding in plain sight, much like a horror film’s supernatural antagonist. It is bone-chilling set-up for the next two installments. However, there are some notable questions that may not be answered, probably due to the cutting that needed to be made for a 2-hour long piece of cinema. Questions such as &quot;How does Shirou get some of the visions he has, namely the one with Illya notifying him of them effectively being brother and sister?&quot; are the more unintentional questions you&#039;ll find yourself asking. Though, questions such as &quot;What is this new threat that corrupts this grail war and its combatants?&quot; and &quot;What is this new assassin?&quot; are where the mystery comes in. It certainly makes the film more conflicting to evaluate, as one needs to truly collect their thoughts and ask those who read the material for clarification of what was cut and what is actually part of the mystery. Though, there is some well-done foreshadowing regarding its main heroine. In many ways, it&#039;s like the recently --and undeservedly panned-- Fate/Extra: Last Encore.<br />
<br />
The appeal is in the dread, the torment from the unknown, for better or worse. Just make sure your endurance levels are high. Aimer&#039;s wonderful ending song shall be your reward, as confusion and dread consume the sky and the petals of death begin to fall.

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
This is my first time writing a review and English is not my native language, so please forgive me for any grammatical mistakes I&#039;ve made. If you notice any mistakes whatsoever, feel free to message me. This review contains spoilers. If you haven&#039;t watched the movie and/or read the visual novel, continue at your own risk.<br />
<br />
As a big Fate fan who watched the previous adaptations and has read the visual novel, I was really excited for this movie. Heaven&#039;s Feel is definitely the longest, darkest and most complex route in the Fate/Stay Night visual novel. Unfortunately, this movie turned out to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290170">
        a disappointment. The problem lies with making adaptations. When you adapt something,<br />
you got to be as close to the source material as possible. Not just adapting it in a literary sense, but also trying to recreate the feeling the original material gave to the reader. This movie fails in that aspect.<br />
<br />
Some might say that watching this movie requires you to have some general knowledge of the Fate universe and that is a good point but I think that a movie should always be able to stand on its own and be logical and consistent to newcomers.<br />
<br />
The first problem with this movie is the weak world building. The concepts are introduced too fast without thorough explanation. In the church scene, Kirei only gives a very short and not too detailed explanation of the Holy Grail War. He doesn&#039;t even explain it&#039;s history, it&#039;s motives, the mechanics and relations of the Master and the Servant, what a Command Spell is and how it functions, what is a heroic spirit, what are the 7 classes, what is a Noble Phantasm, etc. Why weren&#039;t those concepts explained? Because the directors thought those 10 minutes would best be used for the eye candy fight between Lancer and Assassin on a truck full of cars, which doesn&#039;t happen in the visual novel at all. In the visual novel, Lancer goes to the Ryuudou temple to investigate when he gets ambushed by Assassin. No truck, no highway and no mention of either of those during the rest of the VN, which brings us to our second problem. <br />
<br />
Pacing. Some scenes were deleted and some were completely changed. The important scenes where Shirou gets stabbed by Lancer after which Rin comes and heals him, then the scene where Lancer attacks Shiro at home and the legendary moment where Saber gets summoned were all blended into some bizarre intro. There was no scene where it was explained why Shirou and Saber were patrolling around the city (so they can search for other Masters and Servants). The scene where Sakura talks about a boy who would do high jumps after school, which in the movie happens in the shed at Shirou&#039;s house, actually happens in Sakura&#039;s classroom in the VN. After the fight with Berserker, Shirou, after having been wounded by Berserker&#039;s attack, wakes up in the park instead of his house. When Shirou first meets Matou Zouken, they don&#039;t even introduce themselves to each other but in a later scene, he somehow magically knows his name. <br />
<br />
The scenes don&#039;t follow fluidly one after another. When Shirou arrives at a Chinese restaurant to meet with Kirei, it all seems like a random event thrown out of nowhere. They could&#039;ve at least put the previous scene from the VN where Tohsaka tells him, during lunch break at school, to come to that restaurant so they could further plan their actions in the Holy Grail War. Shirou didn&#039;t even look surprised when he met Kirei there which he should since he was expecting to meet Rin. All in all, the pacing in this movie is a mess.<br />
<br />
There are probably many more inconsistencies with the VN that I can&#039;t remember. If you are doing an adaptation, make sure you are precise and consistent and make sure the events and character relations follow a logical sequence.<br />
<br />
The third problem are the characters. Every character, except Fujimura Taiga and Tohsaka Rin, feels out of place. It&#039;s as if they&#039;re completely different characters from the ones in the VN. There are also no starting interactions between characters which establish their relations. For example, there should be one long conversation between Shirou and Rin right after Saber is summoned where Rin explains to him the basics of the Holy Grail War and the mechanics of Master and Servant. That scene would contribute to world building and establish a relationship between Shirou and Rin. The scene where Shirou, Rin and Saber are walking to Kirei&#039;s church would logically follow after that. Unfortunately, we get only the latter scene and that gives a feeling that Shirou and Rin and their relation were just forcibly mashed together. There was absolutely no buildup. <br />
<br />
One of Shirou&#039;s most recognizable aspects in the VN were his internal monologues in which you could clearly see his thought process regarding the situation he was currently in. That played a major role in developing Shirou&#039;s character and helping the reader figure <br />
out where the story is gonna go. It also displayed Shirou&#039;s emotional state and the effect that the events of the Holy Grail war had on him. Of course, there&#039;s nothing like that in the movie because there&#039;s barely any internal monologues and we never get to know Shirou&#039;s emotional state or his view of the dangers he&#039;s currently in.<br />
<br />
There is also no buildup for the bond between Shirou and Saber and, of course, there couldn&#039;t be any since they skipped so much content. Also, dialogue between them was minimal. So when our non-developed character Saber gets swallowed by The Shadow at the end of the movie, of course the viewers won&#039;t care. And speaking of dialogue, it was atrocious. The sentences were simple and boring, there was no emotion like in the VN, they sounded very robotic and a lot of dialogue was completely changed or erased. Why was that even a problem? They didn&#039;t need to write new dialogue. They could&#039;ve used the ones from the visual novel which were fantastic and full of meaning and the voice actors could&#039;ve performed them in a similar way. <br />
<br />
There is very little character development. At the end of the movie, the characters remain the same. There is also no clear explanation for the characters actions. Why is Rin suddenly walking with Shirou to Kirei&#039;s church even though there wasn&#039;t even a hint of them having any relationship at all? When Shirou pushes Saber out of the way of Berserker&#039;s attack and gets obliterated, he never explains why he did that (in the VN he says he did that because he thinks it&#039;s wrong for a girl to have to fight and that girls should be protected). When Rider arrives at Ryuudou temple to save Shirou, he doesn&#039;t even act surprised nor does he question Rider&#039;s actions. He&#039;s just standing<br />
there dumbfounded. The whole movie just seems like a mashup of random events with no explanations and no clear transitions. <br />
<br />
Visually, this anime is very good. Although I like the original VN/Deen designs more, the art style is not bad and it&#039;s very similar to that of Unlimited Blade Works. The animation is outstanding and it&#039;s one of the best I&#039;ve ever seen, even surpassing Fate/Zero and<br />
UBW. The backgrounds are very beautiful and detailed and blend very good with the characters and the action on screen. Even some mundane scenes, like Sakura cutting vegetables, were very well animated. This movie has a really high production value.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is amazing, which is only to be expected when it&#039;s done by Yuki Kajiura who also wrote the music for Fate/Zero and Madoka. The music really captures the feel and the dark mood of the movie. The piece that plays during the battle between Saber and Assassin is what captured me the most.<br />
<br />
The story and characters should be the main highlight of this movie. Heaven&#039;s Feel has the best and most complex story of all the routes in the Fate/Stay Night VN. Unfortunately, the pacing and narrative in this movie are bad. Plot holes and inconsistencies, lack of character development, lack of character interactions, very simple and meaningless dialogue and very few internal monologues ruin both the story and the characters.<br />
<br />
If you are a newcomer to the Fate franchise, watching this movie would be a bad idea because it doesn&#039;t give you enough information to truly understand what is going on and why. My advice for you would be to watch Deen&#039;s Fate/Stay Night first. I know it&#039;s not a <br />
precise adaptation of the Fate route but it portrays the characters very well, especially the relationship between Shirou and Saber. Then watch ufotable&#039;s Unlimited Blade Works adaptation and then this. Alternatively, you can read the visual novel. In my opinion,<br />
Fate/Zero should be watched after all of these so you can connect the information you gained from these adaptations/VN with the events of the 4th Holy Grail War.<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10 - The Heaven&#039;s Feel route is the longest, darkest, most complex and most interesting route in the whole Fate/Stay Night visual novel. Sadly, the movie didn&#039;t give me the same feeling as the VN, which it should, and it didn&#039;t portray the characters well. What do I mean? Go watch Deen&#039;s Fate/Stay Night. You don&#039;t even have to watch it whole, just several episodes and see how Shirou, Saber, Rin and others are different from this movie.<br />
<br />
Art and animation: 10/10 - If an anime would be judged only by it&#039;s visuals, this one would probably be in the top 5 anime of all time. The animation is absolutely magnificent, surpassing Fate/Zero and UBW by a long margin.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10 - Yuki Kajiura delivers again with her powerful, orchestral, emotional compositions. Still, I can give it 8 at most. Madoka and Fate/Zero still have a better soundtrack than this and it was done by the same composer.<br />
<br />
Character: 3/10 - The movie doesn&#039;t portray the characters well. If you think I&#039;m wrong, go watch Deen&#039;s adaptation from 2006 and/or read the visual novel and you&#039;ll see that characters act and feel drastically different that the ones here. If you are doing an adaptation, logically, I&#039;m expecting that the characters act the same and feel the same as in the source material. I don&#039;t want to watch something I&#039;m supposed to be familiar with and then go &quot;wtf, who are these people?&quot;<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10 - I can&#039;t say this movie was a complete disaster. It only failed in the storytelling and character departments. It&#039;s still tolerable, but people who have read the visual novel and expect the same kind of atmosphere and feeling, such as myself, will be left disappointed and people who are new to Fate will be wondering what the fuck is going on.<br />
<br />
Final score: 6/10<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading.<br />

    Heaven&#039;s Feel. The 3rd and final route of the Fate/stay night franchise, and the route that basically acts as the biggest and most impactful route of the series narratively, even having the Urobuchi novel Fate/Zero link with it much later more than the other routes, the Fate route and the Unlimited Blade Works route. Those two routes were more of presenting different characters in the spotlight (Saber in route 1, Rin in route 2 as well as different side characters being more relevant respectively) with different themes and ideologies at hand. This franchise builds itself off those first 2 routes and adjusting to the setting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280122">
        and cast, and even Fate/Zero too if you already saw it narratively to create this massive trilogy to complete the main story of Fate.<br />
<br />
This movie is the first part to that trilogy and I&#039;ll specifically only be reviewing this here. I did write a review for this movie a long time ago a few months after it initially aired, but just before the release of the 3rd movie in Canada (around end of November 2020), the first two movies re-aired itself together a week before that. Meaning I got to rewatch the first 2 movies together in cinemas, and due to the incredibly different opinion I have on the first film, might as well write a whole new review here.<br />
<br />
Original Score - 8/10 for context.<br />
<br />
Story/Writing (3/10)<br />

Since this is a trilogy of movies (approx 15-18 episodes worth) adapting the largest route of the Fate/stay night franchise compared to the other routes getting 24-25 episodes each, there had to be material sacrificed to make ends meet and have the key points fit concisely. So while I can understand why some of the material was cut (we&#039;ve seen the prologue so many times now in different forms and Heaven&#039;s Feel is meant to be seen after the other routes so the prologue portion was summarized really quickly), that doesn&#039;t forgive how it impacted the beginning of the story in such a disappointing and flat manner.<br />
<br />
I liked the idea of the beginning, showing short flashbacks of Shirou meeting Sakura and establishing how they met each other and how she started coming over to his house a lot to eat with him and his guardian/teacher Taiga Fujimura, but I can tell from those scenes itself that the pacing would be rough - since each flashback from the year and a half ago point to the current one had many points after a few months each, but nothing significantly happened in each of them. There was really no time for flashbacks and scenes then to settle down and mean something, as they just jump to the next one and the one after like it&#039;s a PowerPoint presentation. But then the story immediately suffers much bigger problems once the flashbacks of Shirou and Sakura initially meeting were done.<br />
<br />
Because of the prologue being compressed SO MUCH to near non-existence, it makes the whole introduction and initial storyline to be meaningless. How Shirou accidentally interrupted Archer and Lancer&#039;s fight, how he got stabbed by them and had to be saved by Rin as we get introduced to her then, how he eventually had to be carried back home and after a short while was invaded by Lancer at his home, how he accidentally summoned Saber to be his master, how he tried to comprehend the gravity of the situation before having to go meet Kirei to explain everything that&#039;s happening; all of that was compressed into seconds of movie content. Basically because of that, Rin and Saber and Archer&#039;s characters initially felt irrelevant and soulless, and the story very quickly felt awkward and anticlimactic. It took me a long time to really get into the film, even if I was intrigued by the darker and more sinister nature of the route.<br />
<br />
Even Saber&#039;s interactions with Shirou and that bond there felt so compressed compared to the visual novel, which at least gave them time to explore the city and analyze what&#039;s happening each night before having to enter into chaos that happened in the film. That development and character writing evaporated here too into nothingness. It just felt like an empty film with no substance or heart whatsoever put into the writing and pacing, despite having dark intentions and plot points that I do find exciting.<br />
<br />
Luckily the 2nd movie saves the franchise with much better pacing, and much more focused and slow-burning writing but it was too late to save this film.<br />
<br />
Characters (4/10)<br />
<br />
Like I mentioned, the bad writing initially and the lack of prologue made half the characters feel boring and underwhelming initially. Other than Shirou and Sakura, the rest of the cast was pretty disappointing as a whole with barely much chemistry or intrigue built with them. Some development felt too forced as well.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation (9/10)<br />
<br />
ufotable killed it with the production at least, it looks stunning from the action and explosiveness of it to the intricate character movements, although a bit awkward at times when it comes to its choreography of certain scenes, like with running looking really stiff from Lancer amidst all the chaos or some frames looking a bit cheap and rushed. Still, overall, an excellent job as a whole and made the best use of that movie budget/time.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10)<br />
<br />
Yuki Kajiura&#039;s had a great history with composing some fantastic anime soundtracks as a whole. In fact, she even made my favorite anime soundtrack compilation of all time with the songs she created for Kara no Kyoukai. Tons of range and variety, complimented the mood and atmosphere superbly, especially with the darker and action packed moments, and even the light hearted emotional bits too. This Fate/stay night: Heavens Feel franchise was supposed to have a similar feel atmosphere wise to Kara no Kyoukai, so its unsurprising to see her work on this film. While I wouldn&#039;t call her Heavens Feel music the best she&#039;s done, it still works really well with the film and compliments the action scenes at night nicely. The voice acting by Shirou and Sakura&#039;s voice actor/actress respectively were also highlights in that department for me as a whole.<br />
<br />
Aimer&#039;s song &#039;Hana no Uta&#039; used for the ending for the film was fantastic, one of my favorite songs she&#039;s done and one of my favorite ending songs I&#039;ve heard feature in any anime whether its a TV series or a film. Fits too well with the movie, and sounds amazing to listen to as well.<br />
<br />
Overall, this movie had the potential to be a terrific slow-burn start to an action-packed and thrilling route, but due to being compressed for time since it had to fit in a trilogy of movies, it left the beginning to be extremely underwhelming narratively, with no real aim or purpose to really care for the route whatsoever (until the 2nd one showcases why at least). It&#039;s a great looking film with fantastic production, but the writing feels soulless and leaves no impact till Lost Butterfly saves the franchise like I have mentioned over and over again.<br />
<br />
Score for this film - 4.5-5/10<br />
<br />

    The beginning of Presage Flower is quite a mess. It throws random elements and characters in such a ludicrous pace that viewing this work as a standalone adaptation is impossible. We have recycled scenes from earlier works, copy-pasted character introductions and fights which are the down-graded versions of what we have already seen. At least the boob fondling scene was still present. I would have cried if they removed it. Perhaps this is exactly what I was expecting, I am just saying that it is not very pretty to watch. For example, the problem with the dark streets scene is how random it is. Our

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280207">
        characters quite literally teleport to this location just so we could see yet another character introduction in the back alley. It feels quite cheap and there is little to no build up behind it. The main focus in the beginning of this movie seems to be in rushing from scene to another, making the pacing so hideous it is hard to care about anything that is going on. At the very least, hard to get into the work. The second half of this movie is better by a landslide, and obviously this can only be properly judged when all three movies are out -- still the first hour will always be remembered for how bad it is. <br />
<br />
In Fate/stay night by ufotable, we see Saber wearing a yellow raincoat in the rain and looking like a curious little girl while doing this. In Fate/zero we have Saber standing in the middle of a meadow, giving her hand --not towards any characters-- but towards the camera and saying &quot;join me&quot;. Without a doubt, the bar was set ridiculously high for Heaven&#039;s Feel characters to top this. So how did they overcome this challenge then? By making Saber basically mute and giving the main waifu role to Sakura. Fantastic. Now, I am not sure what type of excuses people typically give for liking this show, but the reason why I like it at all this one right here. The characters. I especially like how mad our Senpai is when someone hurts the real canon pairing. It&#039;s pretty cute romance thus far. There are still some problems with the characters, such as Senpai committing a heroic sacrifice TWICE. The rest of the characters are practically identical to what we have already seen. <br />
<br />
When it comes to the art, I was blown away by how mediocre it looks in the beginning. Especially the character design stands out for the wrong reasons. Basically all shadows on characters and their clothes are of the same shade. This makes them look kinda weird. Sakura&#039;s hair is super pretty, tho. Animation is based ufotable but not exactly their most detailed work. Especially some running scenes are (I assume) tributing the source material... by making them look like 7fps slide shows. I guess some people like this, I didn&#039;t especially appreciate it myself. It all goes better on the 2nd half. The two major fights are glorious to watch, and make the movie look like it&#039;s really Fate by ufotable. <br />
<br />
The OP and ED songs on the other hand are good stuff. The voice acting is the same as always so no need to talk about that. The BGM is surprisingly bland outside the battle scenes. <br />
<br />
When it comes to enjoyment, I can safely say this work and the choices ufotable made fascinate me more than the movie entertained me. Personally I still liked the relationship and the fights much enough to look past most of the huge problems.

    ONE THING: DO NOT COME INTO THIS MOVIE THINKING THAT IT HAS LOTS OF LONG FIGHTS. This movie is flawed masterpiece. It is undoubtebly better than Fate/Unlimited Blade Works and you could argue is better than Fate/Zero when it comes to story.The movie has a great pace and skips the introduction, so make sure you watch Fate/Unlimited Blade Works and Fate/Zero beforehand or else you will hate how they skip the introduction part of the movie. The action is slight and spread out through the movie, but it does not disappoint. The animation and art style is very detailed and makes the fights look amazing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263777">
        with the digital effects. The fights make Fate/Unlimited Blade Works look like a poor copy. Luckily this movie is a trilogy and will continue with 2 more movies because the ending was lackluster, and makes you want more. The music and sound quality at the theater I went to was the best I have ever seen in an anime and you could tell that the staff from Ufotable spent a lot of time on the creation of this movie. I recommend you wait for either the next movie to come out or the whole trilogy to be finished because it makes you want more, yet the next movie is coming out in a year from now.

    I&#039;m not sure what kind of person that&#039;s genuine would rate this above mediocre. Even if you were the greatest Fate fan, surely the faults of this &quot;movie&quot; are transparent, namely the incomprehensible structure of the plot and the weak storytelling. Even the score, which should have been memorable given that it&#039;s by Kajiura, was utterly bland.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll be honest, the only reason I&#039;m here is out of an extraordinary love and devotion for Fate/Zero. Every time I watch that show I think more highly of it than the last, and I always wish there was more. A role that should have been fulfilled by either

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304780">
        Stay Night or Apocrypha.<br />
 <br />
I&#039;m reading a lot of reviews of users saying how this is in fact a great experience if you know what&#039;s going on. To start with, allow me to say that I sincerely doubt that. I have caught episodes of shows in their late seasons and have read pages from the end of novels without context that made more sense than this entire thing, and were certainly more intriguing. Second, whether or not you know the backstory to things is often irrelevant. You may not know all of the events that led to the beginning of the Iliad, but even though the poem begins in medias res, you&#039;re immediately drawn in and start to piece together what&#039;s going on. That is what competent writing achieves. You can pick a reputable series right now, and go watch some random scene on YouTube and it&#039;ll get a reaction out of you, regardless of whether or not you&#039;re familiar with those characters and that story. That is the nature of conflict; but for conflict to work you need to have either interesting characters or clear stakes. This has neither. <br />
<br />
Heaven&#039;s Feel isn&#039;t really anything. It&#039;s certainly not story that you can follow and engage with. At the same time, it isn&#039;t some action-packed Hollywood flick where you just turn your brain off and enjoy the eye-candy. It&#039;s just broken. It doesn&#039;t know what it wants to do and presumably wouldn&#039;t have the means to achieve it if it did - at first you&#039;re treated to mind-numbing introduction full of tropes, and later you get a few battles you have no emotional investment in and no ability to understand. How wonderful.<br />
<br />
Nothing short of a disaster.

    Based off the Fate visual novel, Fate Stay Night: Heaven&#039;s Feel is the third route of the VN focusing on Sakura Matou. The route is adapted through three movies. This review is for all three movies. It is highly recommended from other Fate fans to read the visual novel before watching. I did not do this. I watched Fate Zero before Heaven&#039;s Feel and still enjoyed both immensely. I was extremely disappointed going back and watching the original Fate Stay Night anime and UBW. I did not enjoy either entry and cannot recommend either one to anyone. <br />
<br />
Story: Continuing the Fate Stay Night story of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387607">
        a battle royale between legendary historical figures to win a wish granting holy grail. Fate Stay Night Heaven&#039;s Feel adds in more romantic elements mixed with horror aspects and some of the most amazing action scenes in all of anime. The story is not focused on action in the beginning. It is character driven with the characters interactions being more important than the battle royale plot. They weave together seamlessly through all three films. The third film has more plot driven elements than the first two with less focus on romance and more on the action. The first two films are about the character moments between Shirou and Sakura. The third film is about ending the battle royale action and seeing the fates of all the characters.<br />
<br />
Art: Ufotable takes over the Fate series again with incredible visuals and animation. The backgrounds are some of the best I&#039;ve seen. The action scenes are some of the most well animated in the entire medium of anime. Enough said, the art and animation are top notch.<br />
<br />
Sound: The OST is incredible along with the ending credit songs. The voice actors do a great job as well. All of it fits the tone of the movies and works incredibly well together.<br />
<br />
Characters: Sakura Matou is the star of the series, she is extremely interesting and broken yet at the same time she&#039;s the most endearing of the cast. This series has the best version of Shirou in all of Fate. He isn&#039;t a well liked protagonist in the other iterations, but in this one, his flaws aren&#039;t as noticeable. The romance between them is done very well and the decisions they have to make are very interesting with them creating some major consequences. The other characters get more prominent roles in the 3rd film. Rin, Ilya and Kirei get more time to shine. Many of the holes in the other Fate series are resolved as well, but with the fast pacing, many scenes in the visual novel are skipped.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I enjoyed this more than Fate Zero and other work Ufotable has done. The music, art, story and characters were all done extremely well. I cant recommend this enough. Sometimes it can be too explicit and it can be too much but it adds to the mature tone of the movies.<br />
<br />
Overall: I believe this to be the greatest piece of art that Ufotable and Fate have provided so far. I look forward to the work Ufotable does in the future. The Fate series is one of the best looking, most interesting series in all of anime. With this said, I can only recommend Fate Zero and Fate Stay Night Heaven&#039;s Feel as the must watch anime of the series.

    I&#039;ve always been a huge fangirl of ufotable and I&#039;ve loved fate/zero so much. <br />
So much, that I began to wonder why didn&#039;t I rewatch that instead of wasting my time on this? <br />
<br />
It&#039;s so boring and underwhelming af. I&#039;ve lost count of how many times Sakura has said, &quot;sEnpAI&quot;. Sakura and Shirou are the most boring af characters in this anime lmao. Sakura is just there for the male gaze; emphasized E cups, no personality at all whatsoever other than playing the housewife.<br />
<br />
And wtf is Shirou for? He&#039;s like a wet carpet, there&#039;s nothing appealing to him at all and all he&#039;s done is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415449">
        whine about his past and go on about being the hero of justice. <br />
<br />
The pacing is so weird; everyone is just dying randomly. Less epic fights, more szEnpai. I miss my Gilgamesh and Saber. <br />
<br />
Compared to previous premises, this one is just utterly disappointing. But the last bit with Saber is the one that&#039;ll definitely keep me watching the rest, apparently.

    Let’s get straight to the point.<br />
<br />
This film is not for everyone. Not because of the violence, blood and gore one may expect, but because this is not the right place to start if you have just started getting into the Fate franchise.<br />
<br />
The context of this review serves as an overview to anyone who has watched previous works within the Fate series and therefore may address some spoilers for beginning watchers. As such, it is not recommended to read this review if you believe you do not have a proper grasp of the franchise’s world-building, lore, and other elements.<br />

Heaven’s Feel, the third route to the 2004

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271016">
        visual novel Fate/stay night—a catalyst to the gargantuan moneymaking franchise it is for Type-Moon now—acts as a culminating story built up from several hours of background knowledge one has experienced from the previous routes, and even its prequel, Fate/Zero. The film disregards any sort of exposition and cuts right to the chase, which may be overwhelming for the beginner, and may even be for the experienced.<br />
<br />
The first in a trilogy, Presage Flower tells us from the get-go what it hopes to accomplish in this story—skipping the lengthy introduction of knowing the characters into a larger focus on two factors that were overshadowed in the previous routes: Sakura Matou, sister of the obnoxious Shinji, and the very nature of the Holy Grail War itself, a thing that was often hinted and shown at in previous installments but never fully explored until now. Action comes second as revelations become unraveled, and emphasis is placed more on silent, mood-heavy scenes that divert from the usual cheery highschool in-betweens of Unlimited Blade Works and Fate. Little to no comedy exists, and each scene serves a purpose to meticulously bring the story into progression.<br />
<br />
The impressive thing about Heaven’s Feel is it serves as an ultimate story to everyone who has read or watched about the previous routes, and then rewards them with twists and turns that break expectations, putting up such a strong contrast that tells a whole new side to the world of Fate. Watching Fate/Zero may outline the surprises it has, but regardless has enough steam to maintain its slow, mysterious atmosphere to keep the audience second-guessing. It addresses the viewers by properly handling its themes, and this mature way of execution is worth the merit.<br />
<br />
Another reason to not watch Heaven’s Feel early is the chance to miss out on the context behind the characters that get this film running. As Shirou Emiya’s reckless hero-of-justice principle gets dissected in the Fate and UBW routes, Heaven’s Feel is where it starts to formally address his philosophy—a legacy left by Kiritsugu Emiya, and brings it into conflict in accordance to the events that transpire in this film. However, as the pace is slowly laid out, there was not an actual chance to have this conflict be brought into light, and like much of the entire film, only serves as an introduction to how it differs as a story—and why you should care about it.<br />
<br />
The route’s lead heroine, Sakura, actually gets little involvement for the rest of the film, but it hints how she will have a major role to play later on. Other characters mostly serve as agents to move the plot forward, with the early interventions of Kirei Kotomine and Zouken Matou into the story offer a glimpse of what is to come—and it does come, with the climax of the film involving an important character’s fate.<br />
<br />
By the outside, Presage Flower may have weak characterization, but much like the pace of the plot, should not be treated as the end of all judgment.<br />
<br />
Of course, Heaven’s Feel brings out the forte studio Ufotable possesses. As much as action is treated with less importance, the studio does not falter at providing yet another visual spectacle nonetheless. While there still exists a bit of an exaggeration in the “superhuman speed” of the Servant fight scenes wants to portray, the way that they are laid out sequentially over the course of the film gives the viewers the ability to take a breather before being treated with an exhilarating clash of weapons and magic. It may not be on the same level of depth as Fate/Zero’s mental chess games, it is still better handled than how scattered UBW was with its inherent abuse of fast-forwarding, somewhat mindless choreography and constant camera movements.<br />
<br />
With Yuki Kajiura as the lead composer, one would expect choral tracks would permeate the film and every moment would be infused with them. Surprisingly enough, and as aforementioned, the film takes its time more before delivering the suspense-filled pieces and probably had the most silent scenes more than any other Fate entry. Music is used sparingly, but stood out well enough in the times they were used, making a good complement for the scenes. Sound effects and the voice acting retain the consistency of previous installments, so there isn’t anything to virtually comment about it.<br />
<br />
There are several aspects to which the pace and presentation could’ve gotten better, but for encompassing several hours of visual novel gameplay into three 2-hour long films, Presage Flower is a mature and worthy sequel for its predecessors—not only to Fate/Zero, but to Fate and UBW as well.<br />
<br />
Being part of a franchise in this manner is a double-edged sword. There are ways that this situation can execute a story trimmed of all fat, however at the same time it can alienate the audience with what significant regard for context it has. Heaven’s Feel: Presage Flower is not the gateway into the series, but a delightful reward for the ones who have given their time into Type-Moon’s lore-heavy and immersive world.

    This anime is the representation of a good style but a pitiful substance. This review will be kept spoiler free.<br />
<br />
Do you know how very often an anime adaptation can&#039;t give what a novel or a manga deserve? There are plenty of examples like that, but this anime is the opposite. A story like that doesn&#039;t deserve an adaptation this good. The quality of the anime is top notch but the story doesn&#039;t follow, it&#039;s pretty bad. This probably aimed at hardcore fan of the fate series, but after only watching the mere surface of it (Fate zero, Fate Stay Night UBW and Fate Apocrypha in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304101">
        my case) this show just feels empty. And it&#039;s real pity as this show had a lot of potential just like the rest of the Fate Franchise.<br />
<br />
Story (3/10): One of the main drawbacks of the show. It&#039;s unclear of when and how it&#039;s going, you don&#039;t know if it&#039;s Fate Stay Night but from a different point of view or if it&#039;s an alternative phase of the history until the middle of the show. It&#039;s very confusing (even more than the other shows of the series). Furthermore, the story is not really interesting, no clear objective is given (nobody even seems to care about the Grail) and the fight scenes are okay but well below what the fate series used to be. The main objective doesn&#039;t seem to be the Holy War anyway, as it must be the most pitiful I&#039;ve seen so far, I don&#039;t want to spoil you but it seems like it was rushed AF. The main aim of this movie seems to be the character development but the problem here takes us to the next category.<br />
<br />
Character (2/10): This part will be the most subjective out of the review. The fact is the characters are horribly boring. If you&#039;ve watched Fate Stay Night (FSN), you may already know (unless you think otherwise, but then I don&#039;t understand you) that the main character, Emiya Shiro, is super irritating, he&#039;s always making dumb decisions that will make you want to slap him over and over again. Although I gotta hand this to the movie, I think it got better in this movie than what we had previously. I couldn&#039;t give any less fucks about Sakura, which is supposed to be a big focus in the film! All of the scenes she appears in are meaningless and can be easily skipped, she is the most useless character in the Fate franchise, which is a shame for a main character. I don&#039;t really like the direction Saber is going since FSN but it doesn&#039;t seem to be the case of most people, so I&#039;m not gonna elaborate on this. Rin Tohsaka, who single-handedly made FSN enjoyable is only present a few times and we barely see any other Servant or Master, which btw, all seem to have lost their charism (especially Kirei). The only exception is the brother of Sakura who got some welcomed development. <br />
<br />
Art (10/10): Now on to the big strength of this movie. Ufotable made some awesome work as always, but this gotta be their masterpiece in term of animation (at least from what I&#039;ve seen). The few fights are beautifully animated and the mix between CGI and 2D is really impressing. The CGI is well used and only bugged me a few times. The rest of the art is really impressing and beautiful, in my opinion, it rivals some of the best looking movies out there. <br />
<br />
Sound (9/10): Nothing much to say there, if you know the fate series, you should know what to expect. It&#039;s the same style of epic and emotional music. The sound during the fight is also on point, but the saturation to make you feel the impact of each blow is still a bit too much sometimes. The voice acting is normal, nothing particularly exceptional. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (6/10): The movie is fairly enjoyable, it has its moments, but it didn&#039;t give me any particular emotion, chills or whatever. I&#039;m not gonna lie, I was on my phone for a lot of those really boring and cliché discussion.<br />
<br />
Overall (6/10): Despite its big flaws, ufotable saved this movie. However this is an adaptation of a light novel, and you can&#039;t change the story, no matter how bad it is. As at said at the beginning, the style (Art and Sound) is very high quality but the substance (Story and Character) is disastrous. It gives us a mediocre movie which is enjoyable and I would only recommend it to you if you are a very big fan of the Fate Series or if you have some time to waste.

    I&#039;ve talked about the Fate franchise a few times. It hasn&#039;t always been positive. I like the concept, but then you get rubbish main characters like Shirou and plot problems. Let&#039;s hope these films are a bit better than Unlimited Blade Works. We&#039;ll start with the first and go from there. <br />
 <br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The narrative opens basically the same way as Fate/Stay Night or Unlimited Blade Works. Rubbish protagonist, Emiya Shirou, encounters a servant at school, ends up summoning Saber and has to have the situation explained in monosyllabic words as he is very stupid. The film basically covers the first part of this version of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396806">
        the Holy Grail war with the situation getting complicated by a shadowy creature that kind of looks like The Web from Reboot. <br />
<br />
The biggest issue with the film is that the build up really drags. We spend almost twenty minutes with nothing of value happening. It&#039;s all about Garbage boy and his banal relationships that no one cares about. <br />
<br />
On the positive side, it does gloss over some of the story beats that you&#039;ve seen already if you&#039;re familiar with the franchise. The mystery surrounding the shadow creature is also pretty compelling. I can also appreciate this franchise&#039;s ability to take the same scenario and characters and do something different with it even if they can&#039;t seem to make Shirou a decent character. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Honestly, the characters are a weakness of this film. Just because we have less of the characters who are any degree of interesting and more of Shirou and Sakura both of whom are pretty dull and underwritten. The best thing you can say about Sakura is that she doesn&#039;t have Shirou&#039;s annoyance factor. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The artwork still looks good. It&#039;s always been one of ufotable&#039;s strengths. There are some really nice action sequences. The character designs are nice. The backgrounds are nicely detailed. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The acting is well done. Kawasumi Ayako, Ueda Kana, Shitaya Noriko and the rest are a capable bunch. Even the actors who don&#039;t get much to work with on the characterisation front are perfectly capable in terms of their performances. The music is pretty good. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t any. <br />
<br />
Areas of Improvement:<br />
<br />
1. Get a decent protagonist. Shirou is a trash character. Has been in every single one of these anime that puts him in the forefront. Always will be. He&#039;s a standard character with an obnoxious obsession with being heroic who does incredibly stupid things as a result. <br />
<br />
2. If you&#039;re going to spend a full sixth of your film on build up, make it count. Showing mundane parts in the life of a shitty character along with their banal relationships is not a constructive use of time. You might as well show wet paint slowly drying and it would be just as interesting. Possibly even more entertaining because it&#039;s not as actively annoying as dealing with Shirou. <br />
<br />
3. If you have a cast of characters this large, don&#039;t focus on the blandest ones. What is this, Shingeki no Kyojin? <br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
I think this first film shows some potential. It has strong action, some interesting elements with promise. The problem is that we spend so much time with Rubbish and the ever dull Sakura. So, the good concept, strong ideas and epic action sequences end up getting brought down by the focus characters. It&#039;s like if Marvel had done the Secret Wars with Squirrel Girl and The The Invisible Woman as the focus characters. I have to give it a 6/10. It&#039;s okay but it could have been amazing. Eventually I&#039;ll get to the other two films in the trilogy and we&#039;ll see if it improves, but it&#039;s a disappointing start. <br />
