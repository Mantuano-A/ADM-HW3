    Sket Dance is an interesting and hilarious anime that will make you laugh at almost every episode. It&#039;s about 3 people who came together and made a club to help others who are in need. They then try their best to complete every task they are handed;even when someone or something blocks their way, they still find a way to through.<br />
<br />
Story- 9<br />
In every episode, there will be various ways to make you laugh out loud, like jokes,puns,random funny comments, etc.The jokes are easy to understand and  the whole series almost flows smoothly.I never laughed so much by watching an anime before~<br />
There is also some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review54647">
        drama  developement in the series that you don&#039;t expect from AN anime of this genre.<br />
The story is thought out well and does have episodes that has some seriousness in there.It showed some of the main characters pasts and how they all meet and became Sket Dance.<br />
<br />
Characters - 9<br />
A wanna-be samurai? A sensitive but TALENTED boy? A boy that only talks with a computer?YES this anime has many characters that have their own unique personality which i like and they work off of each other, which makes the anime more amazing! There are flaws, but not too much that makes you dislike them. For example: Over-reacting on simple mistakes *cough* tsubaki* but it makes him cute (X<br />
<br />
Bossun made me laugh the most. He may child-like characteristics but he becomes serious when in focus mode. He makes the most hilarious face expressions and is really talented in art and craft.And his great enemy is Tsubaki , one of the student council members and.....read more about it in the manga<br />
<br />
Himeko comes next.You see her swinging her hockey stick around,and hitting people down, but don&#039;t think her as a delinquent yet. She shows her mother-like skills as you watch the anime and she makes the perfect comedy duo with bossun.<br />
<br />
Switch is my third favorite, with his random comment and computer sounds. Even thought he doesn&#039;t talk with his voice, he uses a computerized sound systems to talk. I am mostly amazed of how he could type so quickly , its like he&#039;s speaking himself.And he&#039;s pretty handsome too XD<br />
<br />
<br />
Art - 8<br />
All i can say about it is that is shows the expressions perfectly and detailed;sharp and clear. To me the art is like gintama,Beelzebub,and,MM!.Not too much detail with the casual parts but when its time for seriousness of a extreme joke, it becomes more complex or like the art you see in Ben 10 ,dragon ball,or one piece.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10<br />
As i said, its a funny, enjoyable anime. It made me LAUGH OUT LOUD and made me want to re watch some episodes.<br />
<br />
Overall - 9<br />
Something worth watching.With it&#039;s comedy and drama that will leave you satisfied after each episode.also recommend to read the manga too to read about the protagonists pasts in more detail.<br />
I can&#039;t find anything i dislike about this!

    SKET Dance. <br />
<br />
Just the title itself say&#039;s alot about the anime. <br />
<br />
SKET stands for Support, Kindness, Encouragement, Troubleshoot. The second (助団), which instead uses kanji, derives from the verb tasukeru (助ける), meaning to help or save.<br />
<br />
So just from the title you can in some sorts understand that this series is about, well.. Helping. <br />
<br />
Judged by many as Gintama set in a school life setting, the series have had a tendency of being flooded by &quot;hate war&quot; comments. I agree with the Gintama fans that the series is very similar. But at the same time it really shines on it&#039;s own at times.<br />
<br />
 But if you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review94525">
        think about the fact that author Kenta Shinohara worked as the assistant of  Hideaki Sorachi (creator of Gintama), it&#039;s really not that weird for him to be influenced. <br />
<br />
--- Story ---- 8/10<br />
<br />
Story wise I have to deduct some points due to it being too heavily influenced by Gintama. So if you can picture a scene where Gintama didn&#039;t exist, I would have given it a 10/10.  <br />
<br />
Basically the story is as simple as 3 people, get to know them, see them interact with other people. Easy huh? But it doesn&#039;t have to be more complicated. <br />
<br />
What I really enjoyed about Sket Dance, is how the story progresses. You get introduced to many supporting characters, but not so fast that you feel that it affects the relationship with  the main cast. And this way you get to know the characters in a perfect pace. Both past, present and &quot;future&quot; gets depicted in a decent way.But as said, even if it&#039;s really well made, it&#039;s kinda too similar too Gintama to give it a full score. <br />
<br />
---Art-- 10/10<br />
<br />
Sket Dance is just a really good looking anime. It&#039;s very typical shounen art. They have a very tyipcal shounen trait in the fact that they give the main cast something special, like an item, special hair color or something similar to recognize them by. In this case, you have Bossun&#039;s hat for example. What I love about the art in SKET Dance, is how they play with different ways of drawing. Take for example one of the characters, called Saotome Roman, who turns everything around her into a manga. This playfulness really got to me, and I loved it so much. <br />
<br />
--Sound--- 10/10<br />
<br />
I really, really, really, enjoyed the music in SKET Dance. I have a tendency of skipping openings and/or endings, but SKET Dance, really just got me hooked on both how well made the openings were made to fit the music, and how good the music was. The Sketchbook really fits the anime, and I struggle to decide which opening of 2 and 4 I love most. The youtube part in opening 4 was absolutely awesome. <br />
<br />
--Character-- 10/10<br />
<br />
The maincast is made up off:  Yuusuke Fujisaki (Bossun) , Hime Onizuka (Himeko) and Kazuyoshi Usui (Switch).  Mostly all of the fun about the series is based on interactions between the main cast themselves, or between the main cast and supporting characters. Like how Bossun and Himeko make the perfect boke and tsukommi pair for example.  Or how you have Switch and a girl called Yuuki Reiko have epic arguments about science vs occult.<br />
<br />
But what I find most fascinating about the character maincast, is how the protagonist is in terms, the weakest character, which is very uncharacteristic for a shounen anime. He gets picked on alot for having this kinda role, and I love it. <br />
<br />
But I can&#039;t withold the fact that the main cast, do have kinda, sad backstories, but this is what I enjoyed most of this anime. There is two different types of characters (in some sense). The ones you look up to, and the ones you wanna support, give a hug and so on. The main cast have tendencies of both. Very nice. <br />
<br />
The supporting characters are hilarious and extremely well made. Almost all of them are super weird, like overly tsundere girl, a fatty thinkining she is really hot, student council sadist and so on. My favorite supporting character is probably Dante, who only speaks in Visual Kei mode. It&#039;s just so funny. <br />
<br />
--Enjoyment-- 10/10<br />
<br />
This is probably one of the anime&#039;s I&#039;ve enjoyed most in quite sometime. It&#039;s not as funny in the start, but just takes off after a little while. My favorite epsiode probably has to be an episode, where the protagonist Bossun, drinks a fluid which mixes up all his facial expressions, or the episode where they play Hyperion. Just watch it ok? Come on. Go go. <br />
<br />
--Overall-- 9/10<br />
<br />
Overall. It&#039;s just great. I really hope it will return like Gintama has done so many times. If you have seen Gintama, give it a chance. If you wanna watch a series that just makes you laugh and laugh, but can also hit that soft spot inside, check out SKET Dance. You won&#039;t be dissapointed. <br />

    SKET Dance became my instant favorite the moment I got into it, and it has valid reasons for so. It&#039;s one of the very few anime&#039;s which execute both the Slice of Life and Comedic elements perfectly well. 77 episodes is not a very huge number considering the vast amount of entertainment it provides. <br />
<br />
So the story revolves around the fictional Kaimei High School, with our three members of the &#039;SKET Club&#039; who aid the people in need of help, whatever their issue maybe. You may think at first the number of episodes for this show is too much, considering that it revolves around the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193739">
        very same concept of the SKET Club supporting the people and getting rid of their troubles, but there&#039;s more to it. SKET Dance has an extremely funny and a humorous nature that goes hand in hand with its plotline. With each episode there&#039;s a great amount of witty and comical jokes cracked and at times sticks to making parodies of other anime as well although that in comparison is very less than the original humor the show provides. Adding to the uniqueness of SKET Dance. <br />
<br />
Making a show with a school setting but at the same time the genre comedy being its core is not a very easy task to accomplish as it tends to have a lot of clichéd objects but this is where SKET Dance truly shines. While being humorous most of the time, SKET Dance also achieves what its actually about, helping others in need. Whatever their request maybe, with each and every episode our SKET Club manage to complete the task given and end that certain episode on a high note, while also being true and original every time. However if you are thinking that with each episode, no matter how humorous it may be or how good a finish it provides, it&#039;s inevitable that with the mixture of comedic situations and solving the problems of those in trouble and sticking with the same concept, it&#039;s bound to get boring at some point. But this is where the character development comes in to play. SKET Dance gives a great amount of devotion and concentration to its characters. Each of our three protagonists of the SKET Club, Bossun aka Fujisaki, Himeko aka Onizuka Hime (Also known as the legendary &#039;Onihime&#039; in her past) and Switch aka Usui Kazuyoshi. <br />
<br />
Talking about characters, these are our trio of the SKET Club who support the ones in need. Bossun is the leader of the club, the one created the club and helped both Himeko and Switch join the club. For starters, Bossun is depicted as quite an unconventional character. He&#039;s not your typical cool-guy who overwhelms everyone else on talent on other things, but in fact the exact opposite of it. I don&#039;t mean to say that he&#039;s no help to the people and the club itself, it&#039;s just that he&#039;s never taken seriously. Compared to Himeko&#039;s brute strength and Switch&#039;s power of information, Bossun doesn&#039;t have anything you&#039;d call a special talent. Or there&#039;s probably one, &quot;The concentration mode&quot; as he calls it. With the glasses he doesn&#039;t always wear and keeps it at the top of his red hat, when he does use it though it helps to go over the tiniest details and always help him solve them a case. Bossun is always overlooked at, and I don&#039;t mean in a bad way but in a funny way. As I said before he&#039;s not your typical cool character or some lazy ass guy who them goes on become a hero later in the show. However this does not in any way degrade Bossun&#039;s character and I&#039;d say he&#039;s one of the most likeable protagonist around. <br />
<br />
Next is Himeko. Once known as the legendary delinquent Onihime, Himeko&#039;s past is quite irritating. Always feared by local thugs and students alike, Himeko is unable to make a friend for herself but that&#039;s when she encounters Bossun and things began to change for Himeko. Personally I love Himeko&#039;s accent, where she speaks in a different dialect than the usual. Himeko is a very crucial member to the club and they always rely on her strength which is her power in the time of need. Switch is our next character and he&#039;s a bit weird. He&#039;s a guy who likes crappy video games and always hangs around with his Laptop and so much so that he speaks with people using it too. Switch also is a hardcore otaku and has all the information stored about the students and teachers alike from Kaimei in his laptop which is always an helpful accessory to the club. I&#039;d love to talk about Himeko and Switch in detail but I&#039;m afraid I couldn&#039;t by giving away some spoilers. A couple of episodes are dedicated to both Himeko and Switch later in the show which tells the backstory of the two and it&#039;s very sad which will leave you teary-eyed. <br />
<br />
One of SKET Dance&#039;s trademarks is definitely its epic voice acting. Most of the jokes and humor is greatly accompanied by the way our characters react to the scenario, and in that aspect SKET Dance does it better than almost any other. There&#039;s a variety of opening and ending themes for SKET Dance both meant to be fun and dramatic varying from episodes to episodes. Many of the special episodes thrown between the show which focuses solely own its character has its own theme as well. The artwork is well synchronized with all the other elements as well giving birth to a highly entertaining and at times sad piece of work. <br />
<br />
SKET Dance does not follow a single pattern and thus is mostly episodic. In other words there are no separate arcs and it simply continues to follow it storyline. From the start till the end SKET Dance does not dissapoint you in any way. With light-hearted humor, sad moments accompanied by shocking plot twists, all play a very pivotal role in this anime. The inclusion of the Student Council Academy and its characters is important too, as they serve as a rival to the SKET Club but in a rather friendly manner. For the ones who are having a thoughts or two considering the length of this anime, I&#039;d advice you to overlook it immediately as the fun it provides makes you forget about how long it is. In fact once I finished it I was left with hopes of watching more episodes. Make no mistake, SKET Dance ends perfectly well and does not leave the viewer any questions unanswered, but just as I finished SKET Dance I was beginning to miss the antics our SKET Club provided us. At the start of this show, I had planned on finishing this quick with atleast finishing three episodes a day. Considering how good this is and the laugh it provides you, I can tell you there are certainly some dull moments in this show when I stopped watching it for a while. Yes, the fact that is 77 episodes long does come to light at some point, but that&#039;s all the more reason to take this slow and steady as the enjoyment in the coming episodes is endless as is the same for the entire series.<br />
<br />
SKET Dance is an anime that will definitely go down as one of the best within its genre and is highly recommended by me to anyone who likes anime with some fun and humor.<br />

    You&#039;re probably wondering, is this anime good enough for me to watch? What is all the hype about this anyway?  Well, if you are into comedy anime and just want to have a good laugh, read on!<br />
<br />
The story for Sket dance is about these three friends: Yuusuke Fujisaki (Bossun),  Hime Onizuka (Himeko) and Kazuyoshi Usui (Switch) and their formation of the SKET Dan! This stands for Support, Kindness, Encouragement and Tech, an Assistance club to help students with their problems, big or small at Kaimei High School. Each and every episode there is usually some problem around the school or their city that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73573">
        they go and fix, no matter the obstacle they encounter, they go all lengths to complete the tasks they get, usually with hilarious results. There are also some episodes that they just do some random things, hang out in their club room or actually have some story progression. Most of the story progression so far in the anime has been about the three main characters’ pasts, which show how they became the people they are today. Also there are some twists and turns in the story and of course some romantic progression as well, but the anime focuses more in the silliness instead of the seriousness. Which is not all annoying, unlike in some anime where you just keep yelling at the screen, &quot;WHY ARE YOU NOT TOGETHER YET?&quot; or &quot;WHERE&#039;S THE STORY PLOT?&quot; As I said, this anime is mostly comedic, so it&#039;s not strange to not see much of a story plot since it&#039;s mostly hilarity between Bossun and his friends. So if you&#039;re just wanting a bit of silliness once in a while, go ahead and watch. <br />
<br />
For the animation of the show, it&#039;s your semi-typical shounen anime. There are actions scenes but mostly are there to make fun of the classic shounen scenes, the girls are a bit busty at some times, but not to the point where it becomes eechi. Of course there are some instances where the animation art changes to something different, mostly for comedic reasons, for example Roman Saotome, is the embodiment of shojo anime that there&#039;s time she breaks the fourth wall and turns the scene into her image of shojo anime and also the episode when Gintama and Sket Dance get together and change the art style of the main characters to fit into the Gintama world. All in all, the animation is amazing and well-drawn.<br />
<br />
For the music of Sket Dance... I have to say, it&#039;s awesome! In each OP and ED of the series, there is different music playing, and each is as amazing as the next. Each is an alt. rock songs, but it&#039;s pretty good that makes you want to dance! Of course, that&#039;s me, but I&#039;m sure it&#039;s enjoyable for all who watches it as well. <br />
<br />
For characters, as I said before this is a comedic shounen anime, It&#039;s full of wild and unique characters that you wonder to yourself, is there a school like this I can transfer to? While the main cast are quite the interesting bunch, the supporting cast is much more unique. Have you been to a school where a wood shop teacher looks like Jason, a chemisty teacher that is so lazy but a genius and constantly experimenting on his students with various of chemicals with interesting side effects, a kendo student that dresses and talks like he&#039;s a samurai, a student that is a descendant of ninjas, a girl that for some reason has the power to break the fourth wall and change the anime to her shojo paradise and the girl that is so creepy that reminds us of the girl from the Ring? I WISH! but while the show is mostly focused on the comedic aspect, it does have its moments where the drama shows up or the romance, which doesn&#039;t disrupt the enjoyment of a shounen anime. The most of the character development does go more to the main characters but sometimes it shown in the supporting cast as well, The more important ones are the characters’ pasts, which really shows more about the characters and make you understand them more. Why does Switch talk all the time on the laptop or not show much emotion? Why is Himeko always hesitant to talk about her past life? And why is Bossun always wearing that hat? And then there&#039;s the twist... oh yes the twists... this twist is really well placed that while it is shocking at least, it does make you feel that you, for some reason, knew it. But I do say the drama aspect is what makes me hooked because you have to know more! Not just those questions and problems occur but more are asked and answered as their pasts are revealed and the show continues. <br />
<br />
Why I enjoyed this anime so much was because I love comedy because it brings a smile to my face and makes me forget about the stress I had for the week, so I enjoyed this quite a lot. This anime made me laugh and cry like no other anime, especially the invisible man episode... that still makes me cry tears of laughter each time I see it. I was always so excited for Fridays because each and every episode has been so funny, you want to see more. What are Bossun and the gang up to this week? Is there going to be more progression involving the characters? <br />
<br />
So I suggest this for who want to watch just some hilarity and want to have some fun, all in the same time have some drama and romance in the mix. If you want to laugh so much that you will remember the show for eternity, then I say watch Sket Dance! Hopefully you&#039;ll love this more than I did. All I can say to wrap this up is that I really hope they keep the anime alive and continue it. The manga does continue the anime and it is a great read. The anime is what made me fall in love with the series and made me read the manga as well, so go and read the manga as well as watch the anime. So in other worlds, WATCH THE ANIME AND LOVE IT! <br />

    Overall this series is a 5. And boy is it a 5; SKET Dance takes mediocrity to a whole new level of blandness, leaving the audience apathetic and not really sure why they watched it or if they gained anything from doing so. <br />
<br />
Story: The first thing you think right off the bat from the first episode &quot;so it&#039;s Gintama but in high school, right?&quot; and really, that&#039;s not far off. Two guys plus one girl who is obscenely strong form a team that performs odd jobs around the school which leads them to zany adventures.  Meanwhile there this student council whose leader isn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47381">
        really all that responsible so he around very often for one reason or another and the uptight vice comma-...er, vice president, who is doing all the work for the Student Council  doesn&#039;t really care for the SKET-dan all that much. While it certainly does sound familiar, that wouldn&#039;t matter as long as the jokes were funny and with its humor it could stand on its own two feet......<br />
<br />
..... However SKET Dance lacks this sort of humor it so sorely needs. The attempts at comedy come off as being very uninspired, self-absorbed, or, in a few cases like it&#039;s censoring itself, the last one being very damaging if your plot and production team is so closely related to Gintama, and thus are going to be compared with it. The strength of Gintama lies within its characters and its willingness to push boundaries for its jokes; which SKET Dance either lacks the ability to do or never even considers in the first place. Whenever it makes fun of a trope in anime it’s usually in sweeping generalities and when it does name drop an actual show, they never take it any further than that.  for the introductory of the shoujo-manga-loving girl instead of trying to make fun of ‘hot guy saves a puppy/kitty from the rain’ trope, which everybody and their mother has made fun of by now, they could have pointed out the fact that in shoujo manga whene there is an attractive foreign prince who has never been to Japan before, he speaks fluent Japanese by the sole power of plot contrivances! By taking something that everyone blindly accepts and poking fun at it you get relevant humor that actually makes the audience laugh. For example, in one Gintama episode they use the Metantei Conan method of showing a crime in progress without showing the perpetrator by using a dark shadowy figure. In Gintama they then reveal that that’s actually just how the person looks but the audience laughs because they can remember when they watched that show and how they never thought that much about the shadowy figure before. <br />
There’s a saying on the internet that goes “Don’t remind the audience of the awesome movie they could be watching in the middle of your crappy one.” They pretty much beat you over the head with the fact that they are really similar to Gintama by even animating the crossover chapter. And instead of getting a enjoyable little meaningless crossover where two bands of funny people join forces for a while, all we get is the author stroking his own ego for a bit and some padding, but don’t worry, because as long as we get to the point where Gin-san recognizes What’s-his-face as a proper comedic protagonist it counts as a successful crossover. I never knew that a crossover with Gintama of all things could feel so stereotypical, and they even graze over the opportunity to make fun of that. Not to mention the fact that in the pilot episode Shinpachi’s voice hits you like a ton of bricks and then you see Usui and it’s suddenly Gintoki’s voice. It poses as a great detriment to a new show that’s just trying to find it’s identity. <br />
<br />
Characters: Bland. Bossun, our protagonist has no real business being a protagonist because he’s nothing but a self-insert of the writer. And of course, like every Shounen protagonist, he has some sort of special ability tacked on; extreme concentration. Lord knows he has no intelligence, but if he concentrates really, really hard he can solve the puzzle, which was the crux of my strategy to pass grade 12 Calculus. Sure it worked, but it doesn’t mean I should get my own show. Also, an anime consists of moving pictures used to tell a story, if you are just going to sit around thinking as you ultimate skill, what’s the point of being animated. But my main problem with his is that he has no motivation. Why’d he even create the SKET-Dan? If it was explained back in a previous episode I sure as hell don’t remember it, so it must not have been that spectacular. For all I know he was this loser kid who thought he was really popular so he made a club as homage to himself and everyone would come to him for advice. At least Gintoki opened Yorozuya so that he could get money to, you know, pay the bills. However, to its credit the show does recognizes how useless Bossun is, but appropriately enough they don’t comment on the fact that he could be the author’s self-insert. Hime is a good character that has a lot of potential to be something more than a Kagura clone if written correctly. I always enjoy seeing a female as the manpower of the team. Usui is probably one of the most boring characters of the show, but one of the most fascinating if you read spoilers, more specifically the one surrounding his backstory and why he talks through his computer like Akihabara@Deep. It explains why he does what he does and it fits in with his awkwardly obsessive personality, other than that there nothing much to say about him. Don’t ask me about any of the other characters because I can only remember them with single-sentence descriptions or I don’t remember them at all. <br />
<br />
Sound: The voice actors they cast for these parts have done some really fine work in the past. They are very talented but it feels like their talents are wasted on bland dialogue. <br />
<br />
Animation: Not particularly memorable. Character models look a little odd in places but other than that it’s satisfactory. <br />
<br />
Overall: Is this show terrible? No. Is it worth watching? No. All it does is leave you asking why this show was ever created.  It doesn’t stand for anything nor does it do anything particularly different for a High School comedy, or comedy in general. It just feels like the producers wanted a safer more marketable version of the ever-salacious Gintama. It&#039;s a real shame that it seems like they don&#039;t even try to be original.

    (Based on the 2 first episodes released)<br />
<br />
My first review so, please enjoy and I hope you will find this will help you...<br />
<br />
<br />
- Story - 7/10<br />
<br />
Sket Dance has a pretty simple storyline, a group at school that works together to make the students every-day life a little easier, with hilarious outcomes.<br />
Even though the story is simple, it makes it really enjoyable because of the diversity of characters that show up, with different requests and personalities we can truly say that each episode is unique and I dont feel ripped-off after seeing them, they really amused me to no end.<br />
<br />
- Art - 7/10<br />
<br />
I actually enjoy the art,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36052">
        with not too much detail the characters are well presented and the typical &quot;Comedy&quot; expressions goes along with them.<br />
It is well taken care of even in some scenes were animation could have slaked off (For example, the chase scene in episode 2)<br />
<br />
- Sound - 8/10<br />
<br />
The opening and ending is great! It fits the upbeat mood of Sket Dance...Voice-actors, I love them! The voices fit perfectly with each characters personality and in the funny moments, they tend to make me laugh, specially Bossun´s reactions.<br />
Hime has a really good voice that can &quot;mold&quot; itself to when shes...ahem, pissed, and Switchs voice fits very well because, as a computer voice system, it doesnt show much emotion<br />
<br />
- Character - 8/10<br />
<br />
Probably one of the things that attracted me to this anime in the 1st place...The characters! The way they looked, so different from what Im used to see, the way they act...everything!<br />
We have cheerful people (Bossun), we have the bi-polar one (Hime) and we have the geeky-cool type (Switch), together they make a great team that makes me laugh everytime they jump into action, making any moment a hilarious one!<br />
<br />
- Enjoyment - 8/10<br />
<br />
Not many anime made me laugh as much as this one, it was really amusing and I cant wait for more!<br />
I hope they keep going on and make great episodes like these 2, I certainly enjoyed them!<br />
<br />
- Overall - 7.6 (Ill make it an 8 ;O) 8/10<br />
<br />
I hope they keep the good quality this show has and the potential to become a great comedy anime.<br />
<br />
- A really funny show that wont bore you, at least, it didnt bore me! - Give it a try and maybe you will find yourself counting the days until that next new episode!<br />
<br />

    Here is a series that could have been WAY better if they had tried harder. It&#039;s pretty much a poor man&#039;s Gintama, and that&#039;s saying alot since this is adapted from a manga by the former assistant to Hideaki Sorachi.<br />
<br />
The story about SKET Dance revolves around a club that helps people with their problems of any. Led by the enthusiastic Bossun (voiced by Hiroyuki Yoshino), the foxy Himeko (voiced by Ryoko Shiraishi) and the otaku Switch (voiced by teh Sugita), the go around school receiving help and solving problems.<br />
<br />
SKET Dance has everything pre-packaged to make it a good anime. You&#039;ve got not one, but two

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47607">
        all-star openings by AKB 48&#039;s French Kiss and Gackt along with ending themes by The Pillows. You also have an all-star seiyuu cast featuring Tomokazu Sugita, Ryoko Shiraishi, Hiroyuki Yoshino, Hiro Shimono, Tomokazu Seki, Yuu Kobayashi, Fumiko Orikasa, Marina Inoue and cameos from Ayana Taketatsu, Saori Hayami, Satomi Sato, Kaoru Mizuhara and lots more. There is also an episode directed by Shinichi Watanabe. Hell, they even adapted the Gintama crossover chapter, bringing the cast and characters of the Yorozura Trio into the SKET Dance world.<br />
<br />
And yet, it still didn&#039;t fulfill its potential. Why? Because it&#039;s not funny enough.<br />
<br />
The jokes are too safe and mediocre. The reason why Gintama is awesomely hilarious is because it holds no bar to how far the humor can go. In Gintama, they can show Okita creating a Human Centipede out of Gintoki, Hijikata and Katsura on top of the Bible because that&#039;s how they roll. But Sket Dance plays safer than the combination safe at Fort Knox. Hell, the few funny moments in this series is basically when the Gintama crew do one or two dirty jokes in this, and that&#039;s about it. That&#039;s as far as it goes with the humour. Come on Shinohara-sensei. You got your lucky break and blessing from Sorachi-sensei, and this is what you gave us? You can try harder than that.<br />
<br />
But this series can really score in drama. When it has a backstory moment with some of its characters, it can get emotional and awesome, especially Switch&#039;s backstory. If it manages to have a Benizakura-esque arc later in this series, then why not? The show might just got better like what happened to Gintama after the Benizakura arc.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s why i&#039;m quite optimistic. It has room to improve, and they can nail some serious drama. And this is one of the few series that is awesome for Tomokazu Sugita himself. If you love him as Kyon, Hajime, Gintoki and Hoshi, you will definitely love him in this. He&#039;s pretty much having fun voicing Switch, and he&#039;s the one reason that kept me continuing with this series.<br />
<br />
I suggest you watch this only if you&#039;re a harcore fan of Sugita or Ryoko Shiraishi. Unless if this series manages to be as great as Gintama in its latter years, i would not think a casual anime fan would enjoy this.

    Bossun: &quot;This is SKET Dance!!&quot;<br />
Le Random Guy: &quot;Sounds like classic porn titles...&quot;<br />
Bossun: &quot;You can&#039;t say that! I told you, this is SKET Dance!&quot;<br />
(SKET Dance Episode 26)<br />
<br />
SKET Dance.. What is it actually??<br />
It&#039;s not an anime Dancing. But, as you can see from synopsis, SKET Dance is actually a Living Assistance Club. They help many people from their own problem. But, is it worth to watch this anime? Is this fun to watch? Let&#039;s see...<br />
<br />
- Story: 8 / 10<br />
<br />
The story mostly happened in their school, doing some random things together in their school, and help many people. Not just like the ordinary slice-of-life anime, but extraordinary slice-of-life

          <span style="display: none;" id="review166249">
        anime. The story is light and not confusing every part. It&#039;s actually pretty funny and entertaining every episode. If you fan of Slice of Life and Funny anime, i recommend this anime to you.<br />
<br />
- Art 8 / 10<br />
<br />
In my opinion, the art style well fit together along the story. The character design is match from their own personality (like most of Shounen Anime). Each character art style is different and unique. This anime art style and animation are good and always consistent from beginning until end of series.<br />
<br />
- Sound 10 / 10<br />
<br />
The Opening songs and Ending songs is pretty catchy, and i enjoyed listening them. Not only that, SKET Dance also has a lot Opening songs and Ending songs (so, you won&#039;t be easily bored with same OP and ED songs). Their seiyuu/character voice is fit and improve all character unique personality. The background music is also fitting for the story and atmosphere.<br />
<br />
- Character 9 / 10<br />
<br />
Each person has their own unique personalities. I like all the character in this entire series. Not only the main character, the supporting character is also well made. There&#039;s a lot of supporting character in entire series. All of them is actually very weird in some ways. For example, we have a genius-idiot person (Bossun), a giant-strong female character (Koma Morishita), a person who always talk no sense (Dante), a person who can &quot;break&quot; the 4th wall (Roman),  etc...<br />
<br />
- Enjoyment 10 / 10<br />
<br />
I really enjoy this anime. So far,  havei already re-watch all the series 4 times because i never bored watching this. Sometimes i just re-watch certain episode. This anime is fun, random, and funny. The beginning of this anime is pretty weak, but give it a try, you will love this.<br />
<br />
- Overall 9 / 10<br />
<br />
This anime is great. I actually wanted the staff do sequel of SKET Dance. But 77 Episode is more than enough to satisfy yourself. Watch it? Yes.. You will love this Anime.

Sket Dance is a funny, school-based shounen anime. If you are looking for random laughs, strange characters and censored pukes, this is the right anime for you.<br />
Story-wise, there&#039;s no real plot to speak of and I don&#039;t think that&#039;s really necessary but remember this is based on a manga which is long running so things may start to develop soon. <br />
Art is also good in terms of the character designs and the animation is standard.<br />
I haven&#039;t noticed the soundtrack so much, so commenting about only the OP/ED, they are lively enjoyable songs but nothing that gets stuck in your head.<br />
My opinions:<br />
I will not say that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36877">
        it is an extremely hilarious anime, but its loud, wacky and fun. Its meant to be a bit childish.<br />
If you&#039;re watching without high expectations and looking for an anime that doesn&#039;t try too hard, this is it. The exaggerated drama, the weird gags, the outrageous characters all add to the humor of the anime.<br />
Also, there are fun characters like Bossun and the samurai dude and things happen for no reason really, but I&#039;d say that&#039;s one of the plus points.<br />
It may not be one of the best anime you&#039;ll ever see and I can&#039;t talk about the manga, but the plot is next to zero and things just happen and that&#039;s the way it is, episode after episode. <br />
The humor isn&#039;t witty or anything, the jokes pop out of nowhere and are usually directed towards the characters and their antics, but I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who&#039;s looking for a laid back, fun anime which makes no promises and just lets you feel like you don&#039;t have to be serious about everything in life.  <br />
Give it a try and see if it suits your taste. As for me, I love the anime, I love the Sket Dan and I look forward to having a good laugh every week :)

    Sket Dance is the same as Gintama : ) Sket Dance is about this club Sket-Dan( or in Gintama- Yorozoya(sp) who helps solve people&#039;s problems or dilemma- ( love life,Finding lost items, Chasing Pets XD , and Friendship issues, etc) Like Gintama- Sket Dance does Parodies of different shows from time to time.  <br />
<br />
 The Members of Sket- Dan are Fujisake Yusuke or Bossun- The Leader of the group.( Gin san) The strongest but straight foward person- Himeko( Kagura) and Switch- the computer Wiz expert and Anime Otaku ( Shinpachi). All of them have this close bond with one another : 0. Later on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47347">
        in the series- you will see a back story of the 3 main characters past.  What they went through and how they met one another.   They have a rival group- The Student Council Members( Shinsengummi XD ) who have some sort of quarrel as who is better. I am glad I choose to watch this when it came out.<br />
<br />
 If you love Gintama you will love Sket Dance.

    Sket Dance is a comedic/slice of life/dramatic anime that will leave some of you in tears, laughing. Notice how I didn&#039;t address the whole group? Reason being, is that the anime tends to make a lot of jokes and references that the average foreign viewer will fail to understand at times. The show also tends to break the fourth wall every so often which in my opinion, isn&#039;t very funny. But some good points is that the show has some serious and dramatic arcs which are enjoyable to watch and some episodes that will leave you laughing despite if you&#039;re unfamiliar to Japanese culture. <br />
<br />
However,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review70791">
        there isn&#039;t really a running story behind Sket Dance. A three man school club group called the &quot;Sket Dan&quot; includes Bossun, Himeko, and Switch. They have suffered from their past and because of it they want to help out people in need. But sometimes you might find yourself wondering where the story is going and if there is going to be a climatic ending at all. In some ways, it falls flat compared to the Gintama anime (very similar anime but with action) because a lot of their jokes usually don&#039;t try to go overboard in the silliness and inappropriateness.  <br />
<br />
The art is great and sometimes hilarious. Okay, all the time hilarious. The sound is clear, good music, and funny sound effects. The characters though, have to be the richest part of the show. There is a collection of over 20+ characters who all have a different look and hilarious personality to them. (Ex: The Creepy Occult Girl, The Genius but Lazy Science Teacher, The teacher who resembles Jason Voorhees, The Enigman and Quettion duo, The baseball captain with a huge appetite, The tsundere girl, The wannabe-samurai, and many more.) <br />
<br />
Like most animes, the first episode may seem bland, but continue on watching and you&#039;ll quickly fall in love with the series. Overall, I give the show an 8. <br />
<br />

    Overview: <br />
Sket Dance, meaning &quot;helpers club&quot; (&quot;助人団&quot;; &quot;Suketto Dan&quot;) follows the highschool lives of a trio of friends with what could be described as depressing backgrounds that form the club &quot;Sket Dance&quot; which aims to help any academy member in need. They grow strong bonds with a good bunch of the town that they live in as they go through their daily lives. Sket Dance is a comedy that follows the &quot;recipe&quot; of fellow comedy Gin Tama along with quite a few voice actors, they even did a crossover episode!<br />
<br />
Plot 8/10:<br />
Nice little story going on here, the anime itself doesn&#039;t actually start and finish with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review146105">
        the manga as it is ongoing, though I do feel like it stopped at a good time. We have our group in the &quot;Skettu Dan&quot; working towards the problems brought to them by fellow members of the school, some sort of contest against the notorious members of the school counsil, and interactions with recurring classmates and teachers as thus. Even though Sket Dance follows this episodic formula, it doesn&#039;t leave us without character and story progression, it may be slow but there is things going on in the background to leave you a little teary from either sadness or laughing a little too hard.<br />
Animation 7/10<br />
We do see a newer form of artwork in place with some unique character design. Fan service is minimal but certainly still there as you would expect from a school setting anime. The artwork put in place does a fairly good job to enhance situations going on to set the mood of what could be very funny or very gloomy.<br />
<br />
We also see some pretty cool action themes!<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10: <br />
As the students actually partake in forms of music from time to time we do see quite the variation in sound used, jRock is seen at times along with some heart-warming ballads during the OT&#039;s, ET&#039;s and throughout what were some very gloomy scenes. There was also no shortage of OST&#039;s to get us through the more important themes, a little jig to get through the humorous content or a low-key piano piece as a character gets through a sudden heart felt realisation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character 9/10:<br />
The characters themselves progress at a very alarming rate, that is, all except for our main characters in the Sket Dan. Through helping others out they sure do define themselves as above saving so to speak, though this is not without conquest... they sure have their own hearts.<br />
These students all have their own lovable stories, some of them will surely bring anyone with a soul to tears and some will have you just about punching through your tv screen (and a few walls), we see strong relationships which will seemingly last to the grave and others which are surely temporary for the comedic intent.<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10:<br />
If comedy is something that is up your alley and you did enjoy Gintama then surely give this one a shot, not without some tears Sket Dance is to be taken seriously as a fully fledged Shonen!<br />

    Anime that makes you roll around laughing out loud does not come by all that often. However in the span of 77 episodes, the ones that caused genuine laughter were maximum 10. The rest of the episodes were either simply pleasant to watch or slightly amusing. Many were downright boring. But these are not the only problems of Sket Dance...<br />
<br />
Somehow, Sket Dance fails to get you emotionally involved with the characters. It is not that they are not likeable, they are. Yet they miss that certain quality that makes you really care what happens with them, that quality that makes it a joy to watch

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194648">
        them go about their lives and interacting simply because they are great characters. Which I guess is the point: They are not in fact great characters, otherwise we&#039;d care, otherwise just watching them talk would be fun. But it is not.<br />
<br />
Most bizarrely, this series took a very sudden and totally unexpected turn to fanservice around the last 15 episodes or so, right after going through some of its funniest episodes. After 65 or so episodes with an absolute absence of fanservice the sudden gratuitous nudity and constant breast bounces were jarring and cheap.

    This anime was very enjoyable to watch as to ,that it was a really funny comedy. The stupidity and parody were really amusing and at times I couldn&#039;t stop laughing because of the funny scenes. <br />
However the first episode putted me off the anime at first because it didn&#039;t have impact and it confused me about who was the main character but as the anime progress you feel more intact with the anime and learn about the pasts of bossun and onihime and switch . Which were very emotional because of them having such sad pasts. because of the drama and comedy it totally made

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185913">
        me want to finish the anime and I think that unless u don&#039;t like comedy&#039;s , I wouldn&#039;t recommend this for you

    Three people who will do everything to help other people. While the story is simple enough, it can both be funny and sometimes very touching, it&#039;s hard to believe that every of the main characters have very touching and difficult past&#039;s since this isn&#039;t the most serious anime in the world, but I also enjoy the serious part of this anime and could wish it was more of it! <br />
Since some of the episode tend to be a little boring sometimes.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t stop helping but love every character in this anime, since almost all of them have unique personality&#039;s that only make you laugh so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review43525">
        hard sometimes.<br />
While I would like the creators show more of Bossun&#039;s good side than idiot side. I didn&#039;t know what awesome person Bossun was before I began reading the manga and what kind of trouble he went through, and what is it what makes Onihime and Switch want to follow him.<br />
<br />
If your watchin Gintama I&#039;m sure you will love this anime, because it has some of that random humor Gintama has and some other random factors to it as well.

    SKET Dance is a slice of life comedy manga written and illustrated by Shinohara Kenta. In 2011, Tatsunoko, the same studio behind Kyatto Ninden Teyandee &amp; C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control, started airing an anime adaptation. The anime lasted for nearly eighty episodes and ran for over a year, ending in late 2012.It was introduced to me as like Gintama, but done well. So how true is that and is it worth watching?<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Kaimei High School has an unusual student organisation. This is the titular SKET Dan, a support club that helps students or other clubs who need them. It has three members,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233488">
        Himeko, Bossun &amp; Switch. The series basically covers their misadventures and the quirky people they encounter. This is one of those series where there&#039;s a general order to the episodes, but where most of them have little connection with one another aside from starring the same cast. So, let&#039;s cover the important aspect, how well the humour works.<br />
<br />
The comedy in this is very hit or miss. There are times when it works nicely and others where it just falls flat. Generally speaking, the points where they try something really outlandish are the points where the comedy just fails. Mainly because these moments rely on randomness and characters shouting to be funny. The stuff with their teacher&#039;s bizarre science experiments. The stuff with their other teacher&#039;s obsessions with overly convoluted nonsense. The episode that crosses over with Gintama, and so on. Those are the moments that are just tired and stupid. Whereas the comedy that uses more exaggerated realism tends to work pretty well.<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s the thing, a series like Galaxy Angel can get by with overblown absurdity. Not only is the execution better, but the series is never tied with any real semblance of reality, except in that serious episode that was out of place and terrible. But with this series, so much of its humour is tied to realistic situations being slightly exaggerated. Which means that when they do put something in that&#039;s completely absurd, it doesn&#039;t really fit. This series tries to be a cross between the everyday school life comedy and the absurdist zany comedy but it&#039;s only good at the former and its attempts to mesh the two just don&#039;t work particularly well.<br />
<br />
Comedy aside, there is a huge flaw with the series as a whole. It sucks at incorporating romance. Every single scene where they try to throw in some high school crush or to force chemistry between two characters, ends up being just banal and poorly done. Its like they took scenes from a shite romantic comedy and just threw them in whenever they wanted to develop their characters but couldn&#039;t think of a good way to do it.<br />
<br />
I will give the series credit for having some pretty solid serious scenes. There are quite a few moments where they focus on the characters, without the lousy romance angle, and they show something tragic, dramatic, heart-warming or a blend of the three. And those scenes are largely pretty solid and do their job well. Truth be told, they&#039;re also a big part of why the absurdist elements don&#039;t work. The contrast between a stupid plot where Himeko &amp; Bossun switch bodies and a semi-serious story about Himeko&#039;s tragic past is simply too glaring. In that sense, it is a bit like Gintama, except in Gintama the attempts at drama were out of place with the usual absurdity whereas in Sket Dance the absurd moments are rarer and they come across as out of place while the more dramatic moments work.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The cast in this varies quite a bit. The major characters tend to be nicely fleshed out and have some level of depth to them beyond comedic quirks. The secondary and side characters, on the other hand, are their comedic quirks. Usually that&#039;s two things to them, which makes them better than those comedic characters with one joke, but it can still get old and repetitive. There&#039;s also the issue with the character dynamics. Mainly, the aforementioned way the series fails at romance. Those relationships that are supposed to read as having romantic chemistry are either badly done in general or inconsistent, with the romance dynamic being bad but with the characters also having a more friendship-oriented dynamic that works.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The artwork is decent enough. There are times during the more absurd scenes where things get hectic and difficult to see. On the positive side, the series does have some good visual gags. Aside from that, it all looks fine.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The acting in this is competent overall but, like most elements of this series, inconsistent. Yoshino Hiroyuki, Sugita Tomokazu &amp; Shiraishi Ryoko all do quite well and demonstrate some nice emotional range but a lot of the side actors only have to do one or two jokes and, consequently, don&#039;t need range. Although, to be fair, the actors still generally do fine and it gives you the chance to hear Gackt do some voice acting. There are a few performances that are annoyingly exaggerated though and times when those actors who are generally fine have their over-acting bombastic moments.<br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
Momoka&#039;s dynamic with Himeko frequently comes across as her having a crush on Himeko. It&#039;s probably the best semi-romantic dynamic you get in the series just because it&#039;s actually natural for the characters and never feels contrived or forced. But it&#039;s also pretty clear that they&#039;re not going for a romantic dynamic, but an adoring disciple-master thing. There are some other homo-erotic moments interspersed throughout, but nothing major.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
I can see where the comparisons to Gintama come in. And not just because there&#039;s a crossover episode. Both series try to blend absurd comedy with more down to earth comedy and drama. Both also have massive casts of largely boring characters who are mainly there for a few reoccurring japes. I would agree that Sket Dance is better at the whole juggling act than Gintama was. That being said, I wouldn&#039;t say that Sket Dance is particularly successful at it either. If the series had dispensed with the more outlandish elements and not  bothered with teenage romance elements, it might have been really good. However, as it stands, those highly absurd comedic moment are its biggest flaw. They aren&#039;t funny, clever or a good fit. In the end, my rating for Sket Dance is a 6/10. It&#039;s okay, not good. Next week I&#039;ll take a look at Toradora.

Sket Dance was an interesting anime. It was like taking all anime genres and squishing them all together x) At first glance i thought sket dance would be your typical comedy/ school life anime but its way more than that. Sket dance pulls you in, to the point where you feel like youve known the characters for a long time and it feels like youve become one of them, the Sket Dance.The story was well outstanding. Why? because even if Sket Dance starts off as a typical

          <span style="display: none;" id="review86273">
        club anime it had its own unique spin, which it expresses quite well. The characters background stories were unexpectedly deep, so deep that sometimes i have to pause while watching to realize whats happening so far. Sket Dance also has romance, but its not over the top and its rarely touched upon which is very good for this type of anime. The art styles and the colors were great, it felt lively we it needed to, and it felt serious when it became serious.(which is usually cut off by unserious elements) YOU HAVE TO WATCH SKET DANCE! whether your a hater, a fanboy/girl, or your new watch sket dance. as the Sket Dance say: Support, Kindness, Encouragement, Troubleshoot Sket Dance!!!<br />
<br />
As far as my opinion goes i give sket dance a 10/10

    I was still pretty new to anime when I started watching SKET Dance, but it really got me hooked on Slice of Life anime. It makes me laugh and cry. The plot mostly changes episode to episode, but there is some continuous plotline going on. I love this anime and I feel it deserves to get more recognition! <br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
The series follows three teenagers: Bossun, Switch and Himeko; who run a school club. The club, called SKET Dan, is for helping people with any problems. Whatever it is, the SKET Dan will be there to help! <br />
Each episode follows the SKET Dan helping a different

          <span style="display: none;" id="review82850">
        person, whether student or teacher. Sometimes there are special episodes, usually at the end of each season, showing more about the main characters&#039; backgrounds. <br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The art in SKET Dance is a simple shounen style. Nothing flowery, but all the same very well drawn. The style perfectly fits with the series. <br />
<br />
One thing I like is how Bossun pulls a hilarious embarrassed face! If anything you should watch the show just for that!<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
There have been a lot of episodes of SKET Dance, and therefore, a lot of opening and ending songs. So far my favourites have been, &#039;Comic Sonic,&#039; by &#039;The Pillows,&#039; which was ending song 1; and, &#039;Graffiti,&#039; by, &#039;GACKT,&#039; which was opening song 3.<br />
<br />
Another good thing for fans of Japanese music is that J-Rock singer GACKT voice acts for a guest character! <br />
<br />
The other music in the show is quite catchy, but can become annoying after a while. <br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
The characters in this show are amazing! From otaku geek Switch, to Samurai obsessed Shinzou, all the characters are wacky and fun. <br />
One of the things I love about this show is the utter craziness of the characters. I also like how some seem to represent stereotypes!<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a lot of sadness behind the main characters, as you find in the episodes about their pasts. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
This series is mostly a comedy, and it&#039;s very easy to get into! The plotline isn&#039;t serious, so I&#039;d watch it maybe when you need a break from a deep series. If you&#039;re an otaku, you&#039;ll notice a lot of references to anime and games!<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
I love this show! I think you should definately watch it! The stories and charcters are hilarious, and it&#039;s great fun to watch. If you feel down, this is a great anime!<br />
<br />
Again, I hope you enjoyed my review. I tried to keep it short and sweet! If you have any comments, please feel free to tell me your views!<br />
Thanks for reading!!!!<br />

    Sket dance is a really good anime.<br />
Well to me it is.<br />
Its just a group of highschool students trying to help people around the school.<br />
It won&#039;t be your typically highschool life. <br />
Each every one of the characters has their own unique character.<br />
Even though there is no main plot to it.<br />
The highlight of the anime is the humor and the characters. <br />
Its worth watching.
