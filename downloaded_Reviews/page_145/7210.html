    For the first 4 episodes its very good start interesting concept i did not read the manga i think it would be better to watch anime first.<br />
<br />
Ore dake Haireru Kakushi Dungeon will probably be typical ecchi harem but if they keep story interesting should be fine 8/10.<br />
<br />
Its first bigger project for Studio Okuruto Noboru so hope they will get good response from comunity.<br />
<br />
Many people dont like this kind of anime i like it and have hopes for this anime.<br />
<br />
Story,Art,Sound,Character 8<br />
Enjoyment 9<br />
Overall 8<br />
<br />
Spoiler: Respect for MC though, 7 minutes in and already had kiss.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
TL;DR An uninspiring story, with an unoriginal protagonist, written by an uncreative writer<br />
<br />
This is another super cliché generic fantasy anime, but the only difference it has from its peers is how bland and bad it is in comparison. <br />
<br />
The MC is completely ooga booga braindead and his personality is basically super plain/barely non-existent. The only reason why this story even moves forward is because everyone and their mother are always sucking off MC-kun&#039;s d*ck for absolutely no reason. He was given godlike powers because the writer wanted it and despite having a completely broken ass skill, he&#039;s given even more broken skills.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376449">
        Anyone who&#039;s even slighty relevant to the story loves him unconditionally and then whenever &quot;obstacles&quot; appear, the MC just plows through them completely (and to be honest, if he had half a brain, he could just completely bypass ALL OF IT with his god level powers). The story is set up so that everything relevant in this world ends up going his way. Also, due to &quot;plot&quot; reasons he ends up kissing his friend a lot and doing other weird stuff with female characters - and the way he does it ends up just being super cringe<br />
<br />
MC&#039;s power allows him to create ANY spell or permanent passive buff at his will. Will he give himself super strength or use his abilities in an interesting way? Well, using his power of generic-ness, the first spell he creates is Stone Bullet (it throws a rock at the opponent). Stone fcking bullet loooool, wtf man you could&#039;ve created any basic level spell or passive and your first choice is to throw a rock. Man... And how does he upgrade his spell? Bigger Stone Bullet. I&#039;m dying here at how uncreative this story can be.<br />
His other power lets him have the answer to ANY question in the universe, the only downside is getting a headache when he uses it - he could do so much with his infinite information gathering, but of course, he has the mental age of a 5 year old child, so it ends up being a huge frustrating waste<br />
<br />
Have you seen Kenja no Mago? Well, it&#039;s probably on the same level or worse. At least the misfit at the demon school had a kinda respectable protagonist, whilst Ore Dake Haireru is just a cringe power fantasy

    It’s nice when a show knows it’s a meme and embraces it. One of my only gripes with an anime is when it takes itself too serious for what it is. Ore Dake is aware that it’s an ecchi fantasy full of waifus and an OP MC, but it embraces it and brings everything together in a way that still allows you to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Simply put, Ore Dake is a good time. There’s no real plot here other than rather shallow excuses for fan service-y interactions between the MC and the girls, but you know what? That’s ok, because they’re great and hilarious. Every anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387023">
        doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel to be great. This is the type of show that you shut your brain off for and sit back for some mindless fun. Week after week I was amazed at the ridiculousness of the antics and just had a blast with this show. It’s actually quite funny, if you asked me to give you a story recap of the show, I honestly couldn’t. All I can say is that I loved it.<br />
<br />
The art is really nice in the show, the fight animations were a bit on the meh side, but let’s be real. No one is watching this for the fights. You’re here to laugh and for waifus, and the art is more than good enough on that front. <br />
<br />
I don’t think Ore Dake is a must watch, per se, but it is a very enjoyable show that I loved and think many will enjoy. If you’re like me and don’t think every anime needs to be a Monster, Monogatari or Geass in terms of writing, you’ll love this show. Ore Dake gets 9 kisses out of 10.<br />

<br />
What’s that sound? It’s the sound of another average harem and ecchi anime. <br />
<br />
What else did you think the sound was???<br />
<br />
Basically teenage boy has the power to know anything. Boy gets headache from using that power. Boy uses headache to get kiss from girl. Boy gets Minecraft creative mode from knowledge power and chained lady. Boy attract many girls with that power. Boy can die if use creative mode too much. Boy gets pleasure to restore power. Boy repeats process again and again.<br />
<br />
Basically boy cheat at life. But too innocent to use power.<br />
<br />
Damn I am jealous of the protagonist. I think it&#039;s every

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387033">
        Weeb’s dream to have OP powers and especially my male viewers. THE HAREM. Okay… Enough of my side thoughts...<br />
<br />
Yeah so basically this is your very typical harem/ecchi anime where the protagonist is a total SIMP and is absolutely timid and scared when it comes to the opposite sex. The only exception is that he’s got a “stacked” childhood friend that he can basically kiss on command. WOW that’s a first. But, alas here come your typical anime harem tropes. Typical girl vs girl fighting. Girls stepping or sitting on the protagonist’s face. The clingy younger sister. And of course the boring and redundant plot that a regular series of this type of genre has. <br />
<br />
The quality of artwork is average for a harem anime. Nothing really special about it. If you are a fan of the harem genre this is a fair show to watch if you have nothing else on your list. For my  more casual anime watchers, I would skip this series. There are better shows to watch. But ultimately it&#039;s your choice if you want to have many girls constantly saying “Norn” stuck in your head after each episode.<br />
<br />
Ore dake Haireru Kakushi Dungeon has its good and okay moments. But most times the show feels dry and just uninspiring. The characters are somewhat lacking for a Harem anime and we don’t really see a whole lot of character development. The story itself feels random and unstructured. I feel like every episode it just jumps from random to random. It leaves me all confused. If there was more work into characters and story  I would have ranked this higher. But, again I am not surprised about its quality given that it&#039;s intended to be an ecchi/harem title and nothing more than that. <br />
<br />
But after watching all 12 episodes, I give this anime nothing more than a score of 4 for being lackluster.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10<br />

    DanMachi meets Monster Musume.<br />
<br />
When someone says “anime is trash and so am I” in regards to liking an allegedly degenerate anime, half of that statement is correct no matter what - the latter half. Because either the anime in question is genuinely degenerate, and they are a moral failure for knowingly endorsing degeneracy (whether they’re doing it “ironically” or not - there is no such thing as pretending to be retarded); or the anime in question is not degenerate, and they are a moral failure for spreading slander and falsehoods. I, for one, am sick and tired of hearing this sort of mental diarrhea about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387037">
        how black is white, two plus two equals five, and Hidden Dungeon is something other than an intelligent, tasteful, and morally upstanding anime show.<br />
<br />
There is little doubt that Hidden Dungeon owes its existence to KonoSuba’s success as a comedic/ecchi isekai. You can see nods to that in things such as characters having random English nouns for surnames or mobs being just oversized versions of regular animals. It would, however, be a mistake to peg Hidden Dungeon for a KonoSuba clone based on those surface-level similarities, as their substance is very different. As I already said, this show’s actual substance is “DanMachi meets Monster Musume.”<br />
<br />
How it is similar to DanMachi:<br />
A lighthearted, yet serious JRPG setting that actually puts thought and effort into its own JRPG aspect for a change.<br />
The premise of the story is the MC acquiring a cheat-level reality-warping power... that he has to cast from his literal Life Points, with brutally limiting numerical costs. It’s the stuff of a “How to write a magic system well 101” writing class - the less all-powerful and able-to-do-anything magic in a story is, the more interesting it is to see characters working around its limitations when applying it like a tool to their problems. And Hidden Dungeon adheres to this rule splendidly, with its protagonist having to literally Get Creative in order to overcome even the tiniest challenges. <br />
For example, here’s what Noir does when he needs to acquire some dragon loot: 1) Gain some LP. 2) Spend it to give the Dragonslayer attribute to his entire party. 3) Spend reward money from a previous quest to buy a shit ton of thrusting weapons. 4) Consult his guild handler on where do dragons live. 5) Arrange for a friend to transport his party to the area. 6) Pinpoint a dragon with his innate magic wikihow. 7) Make a pit trap with those thrusting weapons. 8) Serve as bait to lure the dragon into the trap. 9) Have the rest of the party jump the dragon when it’s incapacitated. 10) Profit.<br />
That’s a solid eleven-step plan that makes use of available assets and brainpower. This series is a breath of fresh air compared to almost every other isekai with the overpowered protagonist premise in existence where MC would just spam infinite attack magic and strategy isn’t a thing.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, the way to gain Life Points is experiencing “life’s pleasures” - be it eating good food, acquiring riches, or getting frisky with girls - that’s the setup of the show’s ecchi element.<br />
<br />
How it is similar to MonMusu:<br />
Nigh perfect execution of the ecchi harem formula with a sex-positive attitude. This point will be further divided into two sub-points.<br />
<br />
Harem formula:<br />
Just like MonMusu before it, Hidden Dungeon provides a great case study for a “How to write ecchi harem well 101” class. Write it down, it will be on the test:<br />
1. The protagonist should be likable in general, and above all else, convincingly presented as attractive in the eyes of his harem members.<br />
For example, KanoKari is a bad harem show because its male lead is a misogynistic incel, and Highschool DxD is a bad harem show because its male lead is a cumbrain pervert. Women are not attracted to guys like that, so the entire premise of the story falls apart. You also can’t have a harem lead that is just “nice” - realistically droves of females would not be lining up to suck the MC’s dick because he picked up an eraser once - he has to be ATTRACTIVE in a conventional masculine way.<br />
Here in Hidden Dungeon, we have Noir who is a good-natured himbo with shining future prospects due to his OP talents, as well as your friendly neighborhood savior of distressed damsels. Every harem member likes Noir for their own meaningful reasons and has a unique relationship dynamic with him.<br />
2. Harem members should have actual character. Again, you can’t have personalities that end at “wants to suck the MC’s dick,” “has big boobs,” or “wears a maid outfit” (say hi to Rem). To be good characters a harem show’s female cast members must have their own goals, motivations, and purpose in the story. Put simply, a good harem must be an ensemble cast show - and Hidden Dungeon is compliant with this rule.<br />
3. Harem members should meaningfully interact with each other. This is basically an extension of the ensemble cast idea, a good harem anime would pass the Bechdel test - and Hidden Dungeon does just that.<br />
<br />
Sex positivity:<br />
From Wikipedia: “Sex positivity is an attitude towards human sexuality that regards all consensual sexual activities as fundamentally healthy, encouraging sexual pleasure and experimentation. The sex-positive movement also advocates for comprehensive sex education and safe sex as part of its campaign.” Bear with me, this is, in fact, still an anime review of the Hidden Dungeon series. In a cosmic coincidence, the Winter 2021 season happened to air not one, but three isekai titles featuring heavy sexual themes:<br />
- Redo of Healer, featuring a protagonist that enjoys taking it up his ass in a rape dungeon so much, he travels back in time just so he can repeat the experience.<br />
- Jobless Reincarnator, featuring a little girl masturbating on a hallway floor while peeking through a keyhole on adults having sex, as well as an MC that is a straight-up ugly bastard from lolicon hentai that skips the funeral of his parents to masturbate to hidden camera footage of his underage niece taking a bath.<br />
- And the worst of all, Hidden Dungeon - featuring two teenage childhood friends passionately kissing once per episode as an expression of their love and having an amicable relationship most likely leading to marriage (the depravity!)<br />
I’ll give you three tries to guess which one of these has a MAL mean score of 8+, and which one is panned as smutty borderline hentai. This seeming paradox can easily be explained - in a place that is not this review section, where a reviewer cannot, quote, “address your reader or any other viewers of the series, in either a positive or negative fashion,” end quote - regardless if it provides context relevant to the reviewed subject. The abridged version of it is that it’s very common to see attempts to push a false narrative about shows with a sex-positive tone - that they have bad writing, or bad characters, or other “objective” flaws - which is pure lies, as I’ve demonstrated in case of this series with the first half of my review (there is no limit to how patently absurd and detached from reality these lies could get - you can see even literary masterpieces like Monogatari or Kuzu no Honkai being called badly-written).<br />
Here’s the actual truth: Hidden Dungeon is a high-brow erotic comedy about a realistically portrayed horny teen having a social life and being successful with women. The boy shows a healthy interest in sex without being an obsessed cumbrain, and so he acts upon this interest by engaging in consensual erotic interactions with members of the opposite sex (also known to people that have ever been outside as “flirting”) - to the mutual enjoyment of involved parties. And since their interactions are reciprocal, consensual, and enjoyable - they lead to these characters developing a mutual interest in each other. Hence, “the MC being successful with women.” <br />
Furthermore, Hidden Dungeon is refreshingly tame by the ecchi anime standards, the sexual scenes consisting of things such as kissing, staring at cleavages, or having boobs pressed against the MC’s body. The lewdest thing that ever happens is accidental panty-shots. There is a caveat that the viewer needs to have morals that allow them to comprehend the difference between an MC that consensually french-kisses his future wife and an MC that steals and sniffs the panties of a nine-year-old (another Jobless Reincarnator example) to appreciate this show’s tastefulness. It’s telling that yet another seemingly paradoxical (*explanation is omitted because muh addressing your reader or any other viewers of the series, in either a positive or negative fashion*) “criticism” Hidden Dungeon gets is that it has “bad writing” because the MC doesn’t just molest everything that moves in order to min-max his Life Points gains (“The MC acts like he’s a sane person inhabiting the real world with real-life logic and real-life consequences - as opposed to acting like he’s a hentai protagonist within a hentai” is, in fact, an example of very good writing).<br />
<br />
Unrelated to anything above, one of the main characters is voiced by Horie Yui and her performance is amazing. I almost never mention voice acting in my reviews (because you’ll hardly ever find an anime where voice acting isn’t good), but the Shaft All-Star VA Team are just on a whole nother level.<br />
<br />
In summary, Hidden Dungeon is a pure joy of a series with a protagonist that is a great role model for teen boys, nuanced three-dimensional characters, a deeply thought-out fantasy setting, good dialogue writing, jaw-breaking comedy, plus great artwork and sound - and no amount of slander and falsehoods can change this reality.<br />
<br />
9/10 for a wholesome fun show for people with high IQ and moral standards.<br />

    **This review contains minor spoilers**<br />
<br />
Another action, adventure, comedy, fantasy anime? Well…why not although we had a lot of those in the past already. It has lots of Ecchi scenes and the fanservice is god-like? REVOLUTIONARY. Count me in.<br />
<br />
The studio &quot;Okuruto Noboru&quot; enters a “dangerous dungeon” for the first time with the anime &quot;Ore dake Haireru Kakushi Dungeon&quot;. Previously only worked in a few OVAs, they venture into the fantasy, adventure world. Although this genre is nothing new in itself, they managed to do it in a way which doesn&#039;t make us bored and asking for more.<br />
<br />
Our adventure begins with Noir, the third son of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387030">
        “beggar noble” (the lowest position for a noble). Because of his position, he didn&#039;t get his job in the library. Thereupon he decides to go to the &quot;Hero Academy&quot; in order to become stronger and to get a secure job as an adventurer after graduation. Noir was very nice to his fellow men, but he was never particularly strong. One day he discovers a secret dungeon that only he can enter with a secret spell. This is where he started his secret training to get stronger and stronger…<br />
<br />
There is a beautiful woman with a large bust and hips in this dungeon: Olivia. She was one of the S-class adventurers and thus one of the strongest at the time. She entered this dungeon, but after defeating a monster, she was handcuffed in death shackles. When Noir met Olivia by chance and appointed her as his master, she decided to pass on her special skills to Noir.<br />
<br />
LP (life points) are required to use the special skills. How do you get this? Noir&#039;s childhood friend Emma is the main contributor to all of his LPs. Emma has laaaaarge breasts and is very popular with the opposite sex because of her cuteness but she is only interested in Noir and really loves him. She is willing to do anything for Noir and to get him the necessary LPs with kisses and well… “other things” like that. Everything that is &quot;fun&quot; for a simple man increases the LPs. Noir and Emma has a very close relationship since childhood. They did everything together. Both of them also decided to take on the job in the library. But after Noir was rejected, Emma decided to follow him to the Academy. She really is the vital supporter for Noir.<br />
<br />
Let’s take a look at the other two main characters and their role in this little “Noir-clan”. First, we have the Odin Guild receptionist Lola. She is a beauty of the calm and collected sort with an air of maturity around her. Lola was the one who welcomed Noir when he joined the guild, she was always on good terms with him and Noir also helped Lola in receptionist battles. She is clever and knows how to motivate her guild and especially Noir.<br />
<br />
Lola&#039;s best friend Luna is the last girl in the “Noir-troupe”. All in all, she’s a super beauty and has a good personality. Luna is convinced that it is her mission to save people and make them smile. But whenever she heals someone, it uses up her life energy and this shortens her lifespan. Noir managed to edit her skill in a way not consuming her life-force. Since that point, she fell victim to his charm and decided to stick with Noir as well. Even if all the female characters certainly love their hero Noir, it must be mentioned that they also support each other.<br />
<br />
In addition to our main characters, we have the teacher Elna who rewards her male students by sitting on their faces. Maria, a real beauty who really has her heart in the right place as a duke. Her loyal bodyguard Amane, who always takes care of her. Of course, we cannot forget Alice, Noir&#039;s younger sister, who has a brother complex and adores her brother above all else. She has a special power which allow her to sense when her brother is getting intimate with other girls. Besides these girls, there are a few more who play a minor role. But one thing is certain: All of these girls are top tier!<br />
<br />
It cannot be denied that the art really stands out. All the girls are shown amiable and the fanservice is of high quality. The surroundings are also very beautiful and detailed. Everything fits together perfectly.<br />
The adventure of our group begins with the OP &quot;Pyramid Dai Gyakuten&quot; which tell us to be ready for some action. Prepare yourself for a new adventure that will come your way! The ED “Nemophila”, on the other hand, is about the deep relationship between Noir and Emma. Watching the animation during this song is particularly nice. Each picture tells a little story from their past together. They are a perfect couple. Besides the music, the Seiyuus did a great job performing their role. Their voice and all the emotions go very well with the character.<br />
<br />
As someone who generally likes this genre and also watched similar anime like &quot;Konosuba&quot;, &quot;Shachou, Battle no Jikan Desu!&quot; or “Princess Connect! Re:Dive “ before, I am also very enthusiastic about &quot;Ore Dungeon&quot;. It&#039;s a typical anime where you can just switch off for a bit and enjoy the things. Don&#039;t think too much about it, just follow the adventure with our characters. The fan service part is very successful and I mean we already experience more kisses in the first episode than in many romance anime. Sure, it&#039;s not the same, but it&#039;s certainly not a bad thing in my opinion. Noir is surely a lucky guy. I agree that the plot is uncreative and we have had such things before already. Still, I don&#039;t see any reason not to like &quot;Ore Dungeon&quot; just because of this point. If you enjoyed other similar anime, you will like “Ore Dungeon” as well.<br />
<br />
In the end, I can only say: Just enjoy the adventures and all the S-tier waifus. Let&#039;s hope for a second season with even more adventures from our little group!

    ||Spoiler Free Review|| TLDR - 9/10 It looks great and it&#039;s entertaining. Worth a shot if you don&#039;t mind some ecchi. Sequels aside, i&#039;d say it&#039;s the hidden gem of winter 2021. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art is fantastic. You have beautiful thick lines of shading, well drawn art and above average production values. Ep1 showcases 2D hand animated background sequences which are rare these days considering their immense difficulty to animate.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
It&#039;s professional and the music is slightly above average.<br />
<br />
Story &amp; Characters:<br />
As of writing this review only 4 episodes are out and i can say it has been very interesting following the main character&#039;s adventures. Characters are memorable

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376448">
        and their designs are lovely.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
The show is lighthearted and funny. Very enjoyable. Fans of RPGs will especially like it.

    This anime is on the top worst anime of the season list. And let me tell you why. But before that, let me give a quick pro and cons:<br />
<br />
Pro:<br />
+Good fantasy setting<br />
+Good art with 99% Ecchi oriented<br />
<br />
Con:<br />
-Really cliche story<br />
-Broken powers with even worse power explanations<br />
-No, or Negative character Development!<br />
<br />
First off, let me talk about his powers that most people consider as unique. So yeah, it is one-of-a-kind in Fantasy theme. Unlike all the OP Isekai/Fantasy heroes, who can absorb skills and boundlessly level up by slaying enemies, this guy, the protagonist of this anime, can create his OWN personalized powers. So, it&#039;s &quot;Ability Creation&quot;. He can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376564">
        also Modify Abilities of others, both friends and foes. Now this makes it really dynamic, and paves way for Limitless possibilities.<br />
<br />
However, he only uses it for the most obvious/foolish creations. And that power itself has so may loopholes, in concept as well as usage. And totally spoils the enjoyment in the anime.<br />
<br />
Next most annoying part of this anime is the character development. On the very start of the anime, you&#039;d notice how he&#039;s very grateful and loyal to the 1st heroine, aka childhood friend. But for some reason, he keeps pushing her feelings off and only keeps using her for the most lewdest of plays. And she also seems perfectly fine with it.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve already read it&#039;s source material and dropped it half way. I can say, the story will only get worse and worse after this. But I gave the anime a go, hoping the art and animation would make up for it&#039;s brain cell killing story. But it was mediocre and definitely not worth the time. I&#039;d not recommend this anime to anyone, unless if you are a hardcore ecchi fan, or looking for some softcore H.

    Imagine obtaining a god-like power after being ostracized by your peers. Then, imagine that power can change reality itself. Meet Noir Starga, the young man who obtained such a power and along the way, his own personal harem. <br />
<br />
Brace yourself. If ecchi and harem scenes are not your cup of tea, then it’s best to head out and watch something else. I don’t know how high the author was when they wrote the story but let’s just say that the anime is a lot more than just entering a hidden dungeon. Well yes, it does begin with Noir discovering a dungeon and a chained entity

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387031">
        by the name of Olivia. It’s from her that he obtained such a power with the drawback that he needs life points to sustain his survival. And guess how does he maintain those life points? By engaging in lewd activates with the female cast! With that premise, buckle up because there’s going to be a lot of mouthwatering moments.<br />
<br />
I’ll be honest here. The show itself isn’t shy to being what it really is. It never attempts to hide the fan service and really, every episode has Noir engaging in some form of sexual activity with the female cast. From sharing baths to ass stuffed into his face, you name it. It seems Noir is practically a chick magnet for the girls especially at his school, the Hero Academy. The most prominent girl among them is Emma, Noir’s childhood friend who just happens to very popular with great looks. Guess who she has interest in the most? That’s right, it’s the main protagonist and the show takes every opportunity to get the two together in some form of compromising moment. The first episode had them kissing to restore life points and there’s more than where that comes from. Emma kisses Noir not just to ensure he gets those life points. She enjoys and savors those moments. As more and more episode progresses, Emma uses it more as an excuse to give him life points. And as more female characters are introduced, you can imagine how jealous she can get when others gets close to Noir. It’s harem 101 that anyone with a brain can come up with in writing standards.<br />
<br />
However, I will excuse the writing of the show since you really shouldn’t expect much from a fantasy-harem. The question to ask yourself is…does the writing actually improve? The short answer is no and the longer answer is, no chance in hell. Every member of the character roster is presented like a sex object for Noir to enjoy. These include Lola, Luna, Maria, and even their teacher, Elna. Practically, every relevant female character at Hero Academy lusts for him. Mind you, these girls aren’t damsel in distress. They can actually be described as a ‘battle harem’ as each of them can fight. Imagine that. Not only does Noir have a group of beauties trying to earn his affections but also they can fight during adventures. That’s like striking the lottery for any young man. <br />
<br />
But unfortunately, this show doesn’t care to develop any member of Noir’s harem. They pretty much serve as walking beauties to provide life points for him. And no one really is safe from his attractive appeal. Even his sister Alice seems to be have a brother complex although the anime refrains from going too far. After all, this had to be approved to air on television and having an incest relationship would perhaps cross the line. However, when it comes to ecchi, the anime knows no bounds. Let me just say that kissing isn’t the only way to gain life points. Basically, for Noir to sustain himself, he needs to be aroused. Whether this includes being sat on his face, stepped on, or other lewd actions, it gets the job done. Kissing is just one sexual action that gets him aroused and trust me, there’s plenty of moments in the show that Noir gets turned on. Even as the primary love interest, Emma doesn’t hog all the fun. As I said before, any relevant female member tries to have their way with him, even those with naïve knowledge about sexual activities. In one particular episode, Noir meets Dryade, a peculiar girl with a lack of common sense. With a look similar to Emma, it doesn’t take long for her tongue to connect to Noir’s mouth.<br />

Let me also say that I’m not familiar with studio Okuruto Noboru, they definitely understood the word ‘ecchi’. While the show isn’t borderline hentai, the amount of fan service takes plenty of TV time. When we do get the actual fighting in dungeons and during adventures, it come out dry and empty. But for the fan service scenes, the show goes all out to get both Noboru and the viewers aroused. So let me give you a safety advice and don’t watch this show with your little brother or sister around. They might see something they’re not supposed to and your parents will have to give you a long lecture. <br />

Guilty pleasure is the easiest way to describe this show because that’s what the anime aims to do: give pleasure. It’s how Noir gets his life points and how his harem satisfy his needs. Let’s be real here. Do we actually watch this show for the “plot”? It’s a recurring joke in the anime community. Unfortunately, this show itself is an awful joke.

    Do you love yourself? Do you care about the content you are consuming? Do you have critical thinking skills?<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been watching anime since April 2012. I have seen almost 600 series. I have seen garbage upon garbage. I have seen trashy ecchi harems over trashy ecchi harems. But this is so beyond soulless, by-the-numbers, obnoxious and downright boring. I cannot believe that THIS was the ecchi harem that finally made me lose it. It has EVERY TROPE. The bland, over-powered MC that EVERY GIRL WANTS TO BANG FOR SOME REASON, the big-breasted blonde kinda-tsundere girl, the more timid girl who is badass but throws it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review380559">
        all away because the plot demands that her panties but MOIST ASF BECAUSE MAIN LEAD, THE BLOOD RELATED SISTER WHO IS PART OF THE HAREM AND ALSO WANTS TO BANG HER BROTHER, SCHOOL SETTING SCHOOL SETTING. <br />
<br />
I am a female. I have seen many ecchi harems that make women lewd as a replacement for their character and never really got offended by it. But every female character is so unbelievably punchable. I REALLY do not know how to explain it. I&#039;ve seen good ecchis before, (Monster Musume, Prison School, Sekirei) but this anime just made me angry. I think it&#039;s because I&#039;ve seen so much of these dogshit premises I&#039;ve finally just had enough. The art and animation are so fucking awful. I want to give the MC the biggest fucking wedgie. Fucking loser. The main female lead blonde chick has an orgasm from the main dude sucking on her ear. The receptionist girl is puntable. The blue-haired girl who is trapped I guess exists. The sister character needs to have her room set on fire. <br />
<br />
BTW there&#039;s a scene where they&#039;re training in class and because the main lead one the teacher lady rubs her fat ASS on the main lead in front of all the students. <br />
<br />
I know this isn&#039;t the worst ecchi harem out there, but my God, this feels like the show that is finally making people say enough. I know damn well I&#039;m not the target audience - teen boys and young adult men are, and that&#039;s cool. This review ain&#039;t meant to be good either. This show just fucking sucks that much. I haven&#039;t gotten this angry with a show since Black Bullet in 2014. SEVEN YEARS AGO.<br />
<br />
Anyways this show is dogshit incarnate. If you wanna punch every character in the face and are begging for someone to get set on fire here you go.<br />
<br />
Watch Wonder Egg Priority.

    this is one of the worst anime&#039;s i have ever watched <br />
don&#039;t waste your time with this anime it is so cliché and cringe<br />
i thought oh it might get better but it didn&#039;t they shldnt even bother making a season 2 not once was i ever exited about the next episode the echhi is also so disgusting honestly it has no good plot or story line and characters aren&#039;t any better srsly don&#039;t waste your time unless u want to see some disgusting echhi with a poor story line and plot with no good development with the characters.<br />
i 99%  percent do not recommend. <br />

    Story- It had some really solid potential how the overview was written out and I was fairly hype, however no buildup and episode 1 oriented this whole thing to a standard ecchi/harem style.<br />
<br />
Art- Well drawn and animated.<br />
<br />
Sound- Good audio quality characters sound good, sfx good.<br />
<br />
Character(s)- I would give it a 0, the standard blank slate MC. secondary characters have no life to them, world feels dead.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- Will continue watching hoping for a turnaround , not optimistic , not particularly enjoyable, some OK scenes.<br />
<br />
Overall 3/10 would not currently recommend.<br />
<br />
You may like this anime more if you&#039;re into an anime being excessively ecchi for no real reason.

    UPDATE: this review aged poorly<br />
<br />
The only reason I even touched Ore dake Haireru Kakushi Dungeon<br />
is because my friends were watching it in a discord call. If that wasn&#039;t the case then I would never have even given this show a passing glance. I had heard about it in /a/ threads but beyond that it didn&#039;t interest me. I&#039;ve already seen enough derivative cash-grab fantasy anime to last me a lifetime. And I now know that it&#039;s the most stock standard, directionless filler put to screen. I&#039;m going to put about as much effort into writing this review as the people who wrote this series did

          <span style="display: none;" id="review380270">
        into making it unique or engaging. Also it&#039;s 12:00 PM and I&#039;m tired and just want to crank this one out so I can have my first review done.<br />
<br />
The &quot;plot&quot; centers around the MC going about doing missions and trying to find a way to free his mentor from chains that can&#039;t be broken because the plot says so. He joins a guild (think Fairy Tail but not charmingly silly, just boring) gets every girl to thirst over him and starts tongue-kissing one (with saliva) in the first episode. He fights a giant rabbit in like episode 3 or 4 (I already forgot) and the enemy stat screen says &quot;Big Rabbit&quot; because the writer couldn&#039;t even think of a real name for the big chungus. Of the five episodes we watched only the first felt like it had a story. (Funny thing to note, one of the main girls looks exactly like Darkness from Konosuba, and her name is Lightness. lmao?)<br />
<br />
Calling the characters &quot;characters&quot; doesn&#039;t feel right because they can all be boiled down to the basic archetypes. There&#039;s nothing to them beyond &quot;the main guy who every girl thirsts over&quot; &quot;the girl with boobs&quot; or &quot;the shy girl&quot;. They all act stupid and buffoonish to advance the plot. I&#039;d rather have a series where the main cast doesn&#039;t have the emotional maturity of toddlers.<br />
<br />
You might be asking, &quot;Did you enjoy anything about the series?&quot; Yeah, as a matter of fact, some of the shot composition and lighting was above average. I&#039;d also say the series was actually pretty humorous as times in all its absurdity. The MC&#039;s power set is kinda quirky too if a bit derivative.<br />
<br />
Episode 5 was actually quite funny, where the MC and his harem visit what one of my friends called &quot;the volcel tournament&quot; inside a giant coliseum. The purpose of the tournament was supposed to be a harem competition, but it ended up being hundreds of guys in masks roasting the absolute FUCK out of random female characters and giving them ratings. The main girls are just so pretty and waifu-able that they end up appreciating women again. It&#039;s absurd. If I could recommend any episode from this series to watch out of context it would probably be that episode, because it makes this series look actually pretty bearable without knowledge of the rest of it.<br />
<br />
The only enjoyment I got from watching each episode was laughing at the nonsense with my friends as it unfolded before us. Will we be watching the rest? Probably. Will it be good? Probably not. <br />
<br />
Story: 2<br />
Art: 5<br />
Sound: 6<br />
Character: 3<br />
Enjoyment: 4<br />
Overall: 3

    You can argue that Ore Dake is yet another generic fantasy anime with an ecchi harem plot, and you’ll be right, because it never pretends to be something else than a generic fantasy anime with an ecchi harem plot. Ore Dake Haireru Kakushi Dungeon centres on Noir Starga, who is an ostracized noble because of his low peerage; however, Noir has the unique power of consulting a Sage to help him in varied circumstances, but severely draining his energy as an after effect. One day, after wandering about in the land, he got lost in a dungeon and met a young immobile woman called Olivia,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387981">
        who only communicates by mental waves, and gives him new powers to survive. And with the help of de facto girlfriend Emma, sensual receptionist Lola and eccentric half-elf Luna, Noir will try to become a Hero and your average merchant.<br />
<br />
Please take in account that entering this dungeon review will show you spoilers.<br />
<br />
Story (8/10):<br />
Noir Starga is a low level noble who has the access to unlimited knowledge to a sage, only to drain his life for using it, so he uses on restricted occasions to avoid fatal consequences. He only has a normal dream of becoming a librarian, along with his childhood friend and arguably girlfriend Emma Brightness.<br />
<br />
The same Noir, while exploring the land, gets into a mysterious dungeon where he enters a secret chamber only to meet a vegetative girl bound by chains called Olivia Servant; this young woman offers rare powers to the young adventurer by telematics. After acquiring those new abilities, Noir returned to the town, and then he decided, against the wishes of his family, to enter the Hero Academy, along with Emma.<br />
<br />
In order to enter the academy, Noir and Emma need to do certain things to reach a passing grade, this in spite of the massive hate he receives from the students with higher peerages because of Noir’s baronet peerage. Despite their entire negative comments during the gradings, both easily passed the admission test in the first place.<br />
<br />
Much to the chagrin of Emma, Noir starts getting along with the academy girls by using his charms and the creative powers he keeps acquiring, specially the frail Maria, and even his main teacher, and this not only applies to the school. That’s when they go to the adventure guild to earn some coins, they meet Lola, a pretty girl who is the receptionist, and clearly falls in love with Noir, even considering his total inexperience on adventuring. Maria’s ever worsening health prompts all three to reach Lola’s healer best friend, the half-elf Luna.<br />
<br />
Initially, Luna totally rejects the job due to her also ever decreasing lifespan due to habitual healing and Maria’s extremely demanding curse; then Noir intervenes to overwrite her attributes to neutralize the curse with a reducing wealth instead of a reducing lifespan, forcing the three to enter a contest to get a harem. Finally, after earning so much geld to amortize possible debts, Luna finally cures Maria.<br />
<br />
With the worst already behind, Noir and his harem, decided to start focusing in creating a shop about rare items they’ve gotten during their adventures. Alongside, Noir and Emma keep getting closer and closer, to the point that the Brightness family invited him to be Emma’s guardian to prevent her for being kidnapped; their close physical contact and kissing became a constant, evolving from only kissing Noir to alleviate his draining, to being a sign of mutual trust.<br />
<br />
Their increasing relationship pushes Emma and Noir to travel the hidden dungeon to search for Olivia in order to save her, only to be attacked by an Olivia clone that was bound to Death Chains and severely hurting Noir in the way. No matter how much the Starga primogenitor tried to attack Death Chained Olivia while sacrificing almost all his acquired powers, she always one upped him, even with the help of his harem, Emma, Lola, Luna and Lelia. Noir, reaching a breaking point and sacrificing almost all his creative powers, finally destroys the Death Chains and saves Olivia without killing her.<br />
<br />
Art and animation (7/10):<br />
The animation seem too standard and nothing inventive, the characters look distinguishable and well-drawn, highlighting Emma Brightness (yes, I do like big breasted blonde girls, and I’m not ashamed at all) and the sensei Elna; however, the studio Oku Noboru is completely new, and Ore Dake is one of its first forages onto TV anime, the next one will be another generic fantasy anime with an ecchi harem plot, Isekai Maou. <br />
<br />
Backgrounds seem decent, relatively well detailed; the colour panels are pretty colourful, but never getting too oversaturated like in fellow Winter 2021 anime Wonder Egg Priority.<br />
<br />
Sound (9/10):<br />
The sound is pretty tranquil and happy, the seiyuus are pretty serviceable, but already established, Ryouta Osaka has already got experience on harem leads like Nariyuki Yuiga (Bokuben), Miyu Tomita voicing Gabriel White (Gabriel Dropout), Rumi Okubo in doing annoying girls like Chinatsu Yoshikawa (Yuru Yuri); and the more well-known voice actress like Akari Kitou doing Luna, Sora Amamiya as Master Elna and Yui Horie hanekawazing Olivia Servant.<br />
<br />
The opening Pyramid Dai Gyakuten, sung by Spira Spice is quite upbeat, who also sang in the controversial anime Okaasan Online; Coala Mode sings the more depressive Nemophila. The background music is well written, never too loud and never too quiet.<br />
<br />
Characters (8/10):<br />
The characters are pretty generic, but all of them serve a determined purpose, I’ll only talk about Noir, Emma, Lola and Luna:<br />
<br />
Noir Starga is your typical generic adventure hero, gets all the girls without any effort at all, but I would highlight that he doesn’t shy away of girls and he’s very protective of them, and has a very positive relationship with Emma, even considering the initial kissing motives.<br />
<br />
Emma Brightness is the classical childhood friend who becomes too well endowed and gets all eyes put on her, but breaking the traditional and always negative ending of osananajimis, by finally being the de facto girlfriend and much needed companion of Noir.<br />
<br />
Lola is clearly the traditional oneesan-like receptionist who after questioning heavily Noir abilities gets too infatuated on him. Competitive by nature, she always tries to get Noir to her side without withholding any barrels, and trying to be the best receptionist of her guild.<br />
<br />
Luna is the all too well-known half-elf who is helpful with anybody by curing their aliments, even putting her life in risk, a master on healing, she too became enamoured on Noir, but gives him the right space and doesn’t pressure him.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10):<br />
How can I enjoy an anime that is way too generic and doesn’t add anything new to the genre? It’s simple, the simplicity and the amicable character of the anime, never going too overboard on fanservice, maintaining all the tropes that characterize the generic fantasy anime with ecchi harem plot. <br />
<br />
The show is no magnum opus, nor nothing highly venerable, it just works well within the limitations of the genre, only trying to break the mold of the osananajimi finally getting the ultimate prize (if she didn’t already got it).<br />
<br />
Those who see nothing valuable in Ore Dake are the same overly purist to never like something generic or unimpressive, I do find valuable Hidden Dungeon for the sole purpose of entertaining and giving us a nice big breasted blonde girl who can stand up on her own. And yes, I’m partial to Emma.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 9/10.

    Story: 5<br />
<br />
OK let&#039;s not pretend here. The tunnel is a euphemism for vijayjay.. And the thing that is deceiving about the title is that it makes you think there is only one vijayjay that only he can enter. But it&#039;s not the case. There are plenty tunnels that he can enter besides the actual tunnel.<br />
<br />
Story is very cliched but has good comedic elements here and there.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
<br />
Art is surprisingly good. Tongue movements during kissing are very life-like but kinda gross.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
<br />
Nothing to complain about. But with all the lines the voice actors had to run, I felt like they did their best.<br />
<br />
OSTs are fine I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review391251">
        suppose, I don&#039;t pay much attention to them, pretty forgettable.<br />
<br />
Character: 6<br />
<br />
There are interesting concepts. For instance, a healer that is afraid of healing too much. A quest receptionist who is in competition with others. They add flair a little to the story. Overall, it&#039;s just OK.<br />
<br />
Main character is lame.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5<br />
<br />
Not sure if I was always engaged throughout, so I think it&#039;s not good enough for enjoyment purposes.<br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s just fair.. but if you are a busy person, don&#039;t watch it.

    tl:dr if you want to watch an echi harem anime with an op protagonist watch peter grill or interspecies reviewers, at least they have the decency to actually show the reason you came to the anime.<br />
<br />
This is lowest score I have ever given to an anime&#039;s story. The opening explains that he has the ability to gain the answers to ANY question he has by asking the great sage, even questions that might seem impossible to gain the answers to. However he doesn&#039;t use this power because it gives him migraines. &quot;Well if that&#039;s the case why doesn&#039;t he just ask the great sage how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378080">
        to get rid of his migraines?&quot; you might ask. That question really is the 1st sign of why this show is so terrible, the entire plot of it revolves around a bland MC with no personality or individuality accumulating overpowered ability after overpowered ability and then never using them correctly because he is fundamentally a smooth brain.<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t the only problem though as he never makes a good decision by himself, everything is always a suggestion from someone else. He is like a disposable bag being carried away by the wind which is truly a fitting metaphor because he is trash.<br />
<br />
There is truly no reason to recommend this anime as everything it does is done better by another anime. The genres listed are Action, Adventure, Harem, Ecchi, and Fantasy. Peter Grill has better action and adventure in it, a better harem and the ecchi scenes are more ecchi, not only this but in a fantasy world there seems to be a lack of fantasy races with the only one existing outside of the mobs the MC fights is a single elf.

    As a isekai, the MC suffers from genericness syndrome.<br />
1.Undeserved love from all around. Why are all woman so unrealisticly horny? It just make the story jarring and unbeliveable.<br />
2.Overpowered in a uninteresting and random way. So he just happen to get the luck to get the most overpowered skill, how original. Power fantasy done well is really good (overlord, slime...), but this is just cringe as hell. The power system should be feathered in as the story progresses. You like the character and the world first, then you want to find out about the way the world works. This show just shows you all the stuff

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377982">
        at first as if you are playing a real game. I don&#039;t want to learn a bunch of stuff when I don&#039;t even like the game yet.<br />
As for the other stuff, the npc in this &#039;game&#039; is also very boring, all the trope archetype is here. I find myself cringing and rolling my eyes through a lot of the scenes.<br />
All in all, average. Not desperately bad but not good either. Would not recommand.

Ok so before I start with the review I want to point something out about this anime, even though it is the same story we have seen a thousand times, Character meets girl, girl makes the character stronger in some way. This anime still does have some redeeming qualities that make it somewhat unique in the current landscape <br />
<br />
Story 5: As I said in the intro the story leaves much to be desired it is too bland, it is not serious when it needs to be, and is serious when it doesn&#039;t have to be. There are also things that happen in the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397722">
        story which doesn&#039;t affect the main plot in any way and should not have been included at all.<br />
<br />
Art 6: The art is average. It is ok but not impressive.<br />
<br />
Sound 6: I believe music and the overall atmosphere is the most important part of an anime. But they dropped the ball in this field. I am writing this review right after I finished watching this anime and I can&#039;t remember a single song included in this anime. Which left me with nothing after watching which kind of ruined this anime for me.<br />
<br />
Characters 5: Ok before I start talking about characters I am sorry if I say anything bad about your waifu&#039;s. But the characters in this anime are all clique or stolen from another anime. Let me explain let&#039;s start out with the main heroine Emma (Blondy) she is just a walking clique that we have all seen a thousand times. And I am fine with it when there are only a few cliques in the anime. But all of them are, a example of this would be the main character that looks like every other main character ever. And the receptionist who wheres the same color clothes and has the same hair type as the receptionist in Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7: Even though I didn&#039;t really like characters or the sound there was something that kept me enjoying it as it played (Probably because I was high). But even so, if you have some free time when you don&#039;t know what to watch just put this on.<br />
<br />
Overall:6<br />

    Ok so this anime has just ended a few days ago, but IMAO, to make one is just in time. So, let&#039;s get down to brass taxes. Here&#039;s my rating for this poor anime......(I&#039;ll never understand why some thinks this is great):<br />
<br />
Story- Mediocre 5: As in &quot;Mediocre Pathetic&quot; cu&#039;z no matter  how you put it it was just the usual adventure, magic, comedy, romance and harem kind of anime, was was just as pathetic as those generic anime where it was set in some world where it kinda resemble like a that of an RPG game.<br />
<br />
Art-Good 7: There&#039;s the usual big boobed bimbo in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387926">
        Emma, the usual white panty fanservice, and other eye candies, which would have been nice , but the fanservices were just too limited in some episodes. <br />
<br />
Sound-Decent 4: Given that I have nothing much to say.....<br />
<br />
Character-Good 7: I&#039;d say it was good , since despite that main character , Starga Nior being the usual pathetic main character, he basically know who he wants and yes it&#039;s Emma Brighness...good as it maybe, there were still a couple of harem members that seemly competes for the guy&#039;s affection....And I need not mention them since they&#039;re just as pathetic as the guy , there was also that blue haired girl in the Dungeon who was a 200 year old adventurer that also competes for the guy....What disgusts , was that guy is kinda cheating and I&#039;m not just saying his ability to used cheat magic, but the guy was literally cheating his childhood friend.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- Poor 3: TBFH, it was the hope of seeing many panty flashes&#039; that keeps me from dropping this and there was that possibility that Noir and Emma would be a couple given that the guy has kissed the girl a lotta times, but alas this anime ends in a sour note......<br />
<br />
Overall- Pathetic 1: Jaz a PTW......do I recommend it&quot;? Ans, No....Does this deserve a season 2????? Ans, Don&#039;t even think about it, Bitches.....    <br />
<br />

    Usually I only do anime reviews that I like a lot, but this was such a disappointment for me that I decided to write.<br />
<br />
This anime has good comedy elements, good enough to compensate for its simple animation, Olivia being simply the best element of the entire anime and the only character I managed to like, but they take everything I said and send it to hell with rest of the anime:<br />
<br />
-The protagonist seemed interesting in his context within the anime but in practice it sucks<br />
-Generating is not necessarily a problem but this anime makes it<br />
- And my tolerance for ecchi is quite high, but the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377078">
        way ecchi is placed in this work is ridiculous at another level<br />
<br />
Conclusion: If it were focused on comedy, the protagonist&#039;s power would be used in more creative ways and the inclusion of ecchi was not done in the totally terrible way it was, it could have been a really fun anime, but that&#039;s not what happened.
