    I don&#039;t usually write reviews before having watched the complete anime, but seeing as the only review for this anime is such a bad one, I thought I&#039;d give my opinion.<br />
At the point of writing, there has only been one episode released, so I have only seen one.<br />
<br />
Story; 6/10<br />
There isn&#039;t yet much of a story, but I do think it has potential. If they work it out properly this could be a very good story.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
I love the art. The art was the reason I started watching this anime, and it hasn&#039;t dissapointed me. It was clean, bright and pretty.<br />

The seiyuu&#039;s all matrch the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27993">
        characters very well, which is good. Also the music is very nice.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
The characters are interesting though not yet very well worked out (but it&#039;s only the first ep, so who knows what will happen)<br />
Once again, the characters show this serie really has potential.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
My streaming was very slow, so this might have effected this score. The episode itself was pretty slow, but other then that good.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
I think this serie certainly has potential and could become very great. I am hoping it will!

    Shukufuku no Campanella, a series which I thought had a lot of potential but it just turned into something really boring.<br />
<br />
Like a lot of anime series, there isn&#039;t really plot that is developed until the final episodes.  It starts off by introducing the characters in the first episode, which I don&#039;t have a problem with. After the introduction of each character the main hero Leicester finds a girl called Minette who wakes up and calls him papa.  Each episode the characters would go on a little adventure whether it was fighting monsters or mining for jewels (I think).  The problem is each

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30743">
        episode usually feels boring and dragged because of the lack of any development whatsoever.  I don&#039;t mind a series with no plot because there are a lot of those kinds of series out there.  However a lot of those series either have a lot of comedy to them or have some kind of development to make it interesting.<br />
<br />
Another reason why this series felt so boring were because of the characters weren&#039;t all too good.  Each episode would focus on certain characters which is good for developing characters.  However I felt very little development within the characters.  None of the characters attached to me either because none of them seemed unique.  The main hero seems like he has no flaws which limits the character development.  There are romantic interests that fly around but none of them develop either.  In my opinion the twins are the best characters this series has to offer because they are somewhat unique and sometimes they make me laugh.<br />
<br />
The art and animation is really stunning. The colors fit the mood of the anime and the battle scenes (when they actually do happen) are really detailed.  The town actually looks really detailed as well<br />
<br />
The sound is also quite good too.  The voice actors really match the character they&#039;re playing and the opening was pretty upbeat which really suits this anime<br />
<br />
I really wanted to watch this series before it aired because fantasy is a genre which is rarely used today.  I thought it was gonna be something unique and it had a lot of potential too because it was different.  However it turns out I shouldn&#039;t have watched this after all. Thanks for reading.

    There&#039;s only one thing I&#039;d like to ask before I start my review of Shukufuku no Campanella, and that is; &quot;Was the director high when creating this series?&quot; There&#039;s enough love and peace felt in this anime to stop WWIII(and I mean that in a cheesy way)<br />
<br />
As a fan of &#039;Eroge(Adult Games)-Turn-Anime&#039; type of shows, I usually hold a small torch of hope that it might actually be a series worth watching as we&#039;ve had a good run with shows like Clannad and other Key titles. Unfortunately that torch has been dimmed since episode 2 and I believe nothing short of a miracle can re-light

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29411">
        what could have been a promising show.<br />
<br />
Story - 2<br />
Truthfully it&#039;s non-existent, and if there is a story, I would love any fan of this show to enlighten me on when it started as so far all I&#039;ve seen is how much the cast can keep kissing the male protagonists &#039;behind&#039; to a point that it can prove sickening at times. As a fan of harem animes, I tried to overlook that there may never be a story and to just take it for what it was(good art and harem) but even that&#039;s proven to be difficult. <br />
<br />
Art - 5<br />
The art in SnC is what redeems this show and probably plays a big part to why high school kids and below(and even first timers to anime) have given it a good rating. Coming from AIC studios I wouldn&#039;t expect anything less for our time, and if it had failed in that department, I would have long dropped this anime by episode 1. The art is very &#039;pretty&#039;  for a better word and that is all it is. If I was a naive young girl who picks daisies to make into tiaras(thinking Heidi here), I would most likely rate this show a 9 or 10 as well. Thank God I ain&#039;t...<br />
<br />
Sound - 4<br />
OP and ED are somewhat decent and can play to the anime very well giving it a welcoming invite to any unsuspecting sucker who&#039;s had a look at the art. I wouldn&#039;t go as far as saying the sound is terrible but I have heard better.<br />
<br />
Character - 3<br />
This is where the anime fails and I believe it&#039;s never going to pick itself up anytime soon either. We have characters that are very 2 dimensional that I would have had finer amusement watching paint dry before one of the cast does something noteworthy. The traits feel &#039;borrowed&#039; from other anime and there is lack of originality in any of the given roles. What get&#039;s me the most is that the humor they try to provide is suitable for kids under 16 yet portrays a semi-ecchi cast for people over 16. Are they trying to say fanboys will laugh at anything as long as you provide them fan-service? To top matters off, the apathetic approach the main protagonist has towards his harem can be so off-turning that it&#039;s made me want to cheer for those weak male leads I use to dislike in romcoms and harem anime(the shy and easy to nose-bleed types). There&#039;s a fine line between happy characters, and characters that act too hard to portray happiness. SnC would be of the latter that there&#039;s enough cheese to go with the whine I have by the end of each episode(pardon the pun)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 3<br />
My enjoyment for this show stayed at episode 1 and had lost its way since episode 2 too a point of no return. While  there might be an appeal to it  that invites attention to any little girl out there who dreams of being Sailor Moon, its just not a show for everyone. The art and sound, decent as it comes, just does not take the focus off of what the show is lacking. <br />
<br />
Overall - 4<br />
Considering I&#039;m at episode 5 by the time I&#039;ve had written this review, I&#039;m not going to all out drop it(as yet). There is room for improvement as we&#039;re about to reach the 2nd half of the series and I can only hope that Windmill(creators of the game and also another game/anime Happiness) has a stern talk to the director to maybe steer this from the train wreck that it&#039;s about to become. Then again, its from the same director who did Omamori Himari(and look at how that ended).

    &quot;The girl wakes up and says &quot;You must be my father!&quot;. The encounter with the mysterious girl brings an unexpected adventure to Leicester.&quot;<br />

That is a tidbit of the description of this summer 2010 anime, Shukufuku no Campanella. Just with that line one may feel a Maury Povich show vibe coming off of this, at least I know I did. However, this show is not about some guy who ran away from town after &quot;knocking some slut up&quot; like they would say on the Maury show..this is something completely different. As a little information about myself, I very very rarely drop shows and I have only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28537">
        dropped a grand total of 5 shows in my whole anime watching history. This show is the 5th show I have dropped and there is a reason for that.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s get started shall we? First off the story to this show is nonexistent. You are thrown into a whimsical Final Fantasy mixed with Aria setting with a bunch of random characters that get literally 5 seconds of introduction and walk around and literally do nothing. Now, some may say &quot;plenty of shows are about nothing&quot; and I agree, however..coming from a man who has Lucky Star on his favorites and even has it plastered on his car this show is beyond boring..even for a Lucky Star fan. The first episode was nothing more than just random flashing names of the characters and a few seconds of some &quot;puppet&quot; girl who was born from a meteor. The subsequent episodes did not explain anything and even went on to describe some incredibly bad and poorly scripted &quot;fight scenes&quot; that look like something out of a terrible JRPG that shouldn&#039;t have been made. There is literally no explanation on why they fight and the whole idea of &quot;questing&quot; is thrown in completely off guard and randomly. I generally do not judge a book by its cover and watch at least 3 episodes of something before judging it, but in Shukufuku no Campanella&#039;s case unless ICP comes down from the sky and makes a miracle this show will not get any better story wise.<br />
<br />
As for the art and sound they are incredibly average. The use of pastels and the whimsical setting is a little out of the ordinary in today&#039;s anime which is a plus. However, to make up for the lack of story and characters this show would definitely need some stunning scenery porn, yet it does nothing but be incredibly average. The sound is your basic fantasy music and is nothing extraordinary nor is it terrible. <br />
<br />
As for the characters, I have to ask &quot;What characters?&quot; This show is seemingly lacking characters...they introduced a whole bunch of them in the first episode yet none of them are recognizable and none of them have any unique traits. It&#039;s like watching a bunch of clones with different wigs on interact. The girls in it are your typical ditzy idiots who fall over and have their tits rub up against the clueless male lead, which in this case is brain dead rather than clueless. The only way I could tell the girls apart was their outfits..they all seemingly act the same and are all just blobs with different hats/clothes/hair. As for the male lead, he is even worse than your generic male lead..he doesn&#039;t even acknowledge any of the girls and for some reason has literally 5 lines per episode. For a supposed &quot;harem romance/fantasy&quot; show the male lead has to at least interact with the girls...hell, him tripping and falling on their tits or running away from the one girl who wants to marry him would be more entertaining than this guy. He literally has no personality along with no spine. The only good thing about this show was probably the male lead&#039;s mom who was a total slutty tease and seemingly was the only character that I can remember after watching the show.<br />
<br />
Overall, this series gets a 3. There is so many things wrong with this anime and with the time constraint of 12 episodes, I doubt this can improve to a &quot;worth watching&quot; point. There is barely anything going for this show and what is going for it is the art and music which is average at best. The utter lack of characters mixed with the complete lack of any coherent story made me drop this show which is a very rare thing for me to do. I&#039;ve sat through plenty of &quot;awful&quot; shows yet it takes a certain show for me to actually drop it. Shukufuku no Campanella is one of those shows that is on a tier where I cannot actually stand watching it. I would definitely not recommend this show to anybody since the fantasy/romance genre has so many other prime subjects to watch while this is just straight up pathetic. Maybe next time I wont be attracted by the description of a show as much as I was for this one. This is definitely not the hilarious drama involving some guy skipping town after knocking up one of the local girls that was hinted at for the description.

    My rating uses the actual words given by MAL. Hence, a 5 is average and a 7 is good. My goal is to be as unbiased as possible so i suggest reading the review rather than looking at my rating to make your choice.<br />
<br />
-This is a Harem, but not a romance.<br />
As you can tell from the genre box. However, don&#039;t despair if this is not your cup of tea. The main focus of the show is not of winning over each girl, and in fact rarely plays into the plot.<br />
<br />
-Fanservice is relatively minimal.<br />
Surprisingly, there are a few episodes that do not contain any at all.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31223">
        In most it is usually delivered in one or two obvious service focused scenes. However, you can expect Minette to be innocent and moé to supplement for this.<br />
<br />
-Leicester is not an average lead.<br />
Unlike most of the failures in our harem shows, Leicester is a breath of fresh air. Not only reliable, he can kick butt relatively well. Essentially, he is a smart character who is actually useful. This also means he is not exactly dense. Plus, he is more on the side of a Bishounen. However, i would not claim him to be an exceptional character.<br />
<br />
-Expect lots of happiness.<br />
The animation is always bright, shiny, and warm. You can expect to take any dramatic moments lightly due to the animation and to be quickly resolved.<br />
<br />
-This show suffers from last minute plot.<br />
The theory goes that: If a show has focused around unimportant events with no relation, then they will try to stuff in an ending arc. In Campanella&#039;s case it results in a friendship conquering adversity and saving the world. <br />
<br />
<br />
-Don&#039;t expect much adventuring and questing.<br />
Despite the fact that the Campanella is tasked with accepting and accomplishing quests, don&#039;t expect anything special. There might be less than 5-6 battle scenes in total, but animated pretty well when there are. Otherwise you will spend your time following Minette tour the town getting groceries, or solving lame puzzles.<br />
<br />
-No character development. <br />
Pretty straightforward. Some exceptions are Minette making choices on her own and learning everything since her life experience is relative to a newborn. If you looked at the rest of the cast, at both the start and the end, they did not mature at all. <br />
<br />
-Low comedic value.<br />
I give a warning that it is hard to make me laugh. I give props to the side characters Ritos and Salsa for making me smirk though; they are not bad characters, and their&#039; pokémon&#039; Golem is always interesting to listen to. I have to say an exception would be laughing at the ridiculousness of the last episode.

    In a world powered by a magical substance called Ale, Leicester Maycraft is a technician working for the adventurous Oasis clan. He and his comrades take jobs helping others in various ways, usually involving stopping Ale-powered &quot;Crystal Monsters.&quot; Leicester is living the life, surrounded by a good amount of lovely girls who are always willing to shove themselves in front of him for his attention. Alas, this wonderful world made possible by the abundance of Ale is being threatened by the flow of the Ale itself...<br />
<br />
Shukufuku no Campanella is interesting. No wait, that&#039;s a lie. It&#039;s incredibly boring. Sukufuku is an adaptation of an ero-visual

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39190">
        novel, but you would probably never be able to tell this from the anime itself. As a result of the sudden change of direction, everything about Shukufuku feels half-baked and strangely maneuvered.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves are not exceptional. We have the childhood friend, Carina; the loli, Minette; the modest warrior, Chelsea; the outgoing girl, Agnes; the opposite twins, Salsa and Ritos; and the slightly airheaded one, Garnet. There is very little if any development of any of these characters except for Minette, and only because she is a central part of the overarching story. As a result, all of the characters are left flat and uninteresting, rarely venturing outside of their individual archetypes that everyone has seen before. Ritos and Salsa do have their moments, however. They have amazing chemistry and I found myself enjoying the segments where they were the focus very much. Unfortunately, as they are not actually part of Clan Oasis, they were not around as often as the rest of the characters, and their parts were usually used as transitions from one half of an episode to another.<br />
<br />
The story itself was also quite conventional. The basis of everything seemed to be to defeat the monsters as they appeared, which is all good and well for an adventure anime. The monster designs seemed bland, though, and the fight scenes were not particularly phenomenal or even memorable. The final fight was an exception to this in a way; it was fairly exciting and had me wishing more of the show was like this. The story&#039;s progress at the end, on the other hand, seemed to fall apart. It felt like much was skipped in order to fit all the events into one episode, and the puzzle and &quot;Spirit Bomb&quot; ending did not help make this any better.<br />
<br />
Now, being based on an eroge visual novel, there would of course be plenty of fanservice. And there was, but it was toned down to become a bit awkward in most situations; most of the time I felt like the swimsuit stills and other various fanservice scenes were inserted just because there was no other fanservice in that episode and they didn&#039;t bother coming up with some sort of transition to most of it. In order to avoid this, much of the fanservice was placed in parts about Ritos and Salsa, further reducing their status as characters with any sort of real meaning in the story. Finally, as the scenes involving sex and actual nudity obviously had to be taken out to work in anime form, scenes that lead to these parts felt only half-done. The biggest perpetrator of this to me was when Leicester was putting Chelsea to bed after her party was compromising to say the least - not that there was much they could do to prevent that outside of removing the scene completely.<br />
<br />
Overall, there is simply nothing outstanding about Shukufuku, and the things it tries to do it does averagely or below averagely. If you are a fan of shallow adventure stories with a bit of fanservice, then this may very well be the show for you. But it certainly didn&#039;t do much for me at all.

    Getting this out of the way right now:  I&#039;m the type of guy who&#039;d stop watching anime if a young male lead (or supporting lead) gets too harsh a treatment.  That&#039;s why I have this violent allergic reaction towards too many of the anime titles.  The prevalent attitude between the anime industry and its many fans is that &quot;certain titles are popular when the guys are treated badly or, in K-on&#039;s case, not there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shuku Camp is NO &quot;Asobi ni Ikuyo,&quot; &quot;Occult Academy,&quot; &quot;Okami-san,&quot; &quot;Seitokai Yakuindomo,&quot; &quot;Legend of Legendary Heroes,&quot; &quot;Seikirei II,&quot; &quot;Amagami SS,&quot; or any of their ilk.<br />
<br />
This show is like Aria

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29336">
        + a useful young guy; the type who won&#039;t wimp out for the sake of what Rika said in &quot;When The Cicada Cry:&quot;  &quot;Japanese young men are... weak.&quot;<br />
<br />
Also; the cute (young) women herein have their strengths and weaknesses.  They&#039;re not invincible or &quot;Mary Sue -esque&quot; like the lot of other female characters from popular shows.  Chelsea&#039;s no Tomoyo (from Clannad), and this show&#039;s yet to have a &quot;BEAT THE CRAP OUTTA ANY GUY&quot; &quot;tsundere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally; Shuku Camp is a &quot;calming anti-thesis.&quot;  When every other anime title is catering to their fan&#039;s &quot;pessimistic darkness&quot; (or, in terms of K-on again, &quot;solving the problem by not dealing with it at all&quot;), Shuku Camp is one of the few bright lights that remind the rest of us &quot;the true greatness of anime.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then there&#039;s the little fanservice it has.  Sorta like Ikki Tousen where fanservice CAN be down without doing it at some poor guy&#039;s expense.

    First and foremost, since this show is most likely aimed at tween girls, I think I&#039;m getting diabetes from cutesy/moe overload.<br />
<br />
Story:  The&#039;res only been 2 eps since this review so I can&#039;t say too much but so far it just seems as your typical adventure/magic recycled anime that we&#039;ve all seen before.<br />
<br />
Art:  Very polished animation and they cram cute down your throat by having anything that can possibly be made so, as moe as it can be.<br />
<br />
Sound/Character:  Not much to say, average for a girls anime<br />
<br />
This show reminds me so far of the second season of Koihime Musou, so if you enjoyed

    This is my first review and watching 2 episodes of the series it seems alright.<br />
<br />
The story line of the anime is still not clear, but the anime can be good if they work out a storyline<br />
<br />
The art is very nice and cute its probably the reason why most of the people who watched this got attracted to it.<br />
<br />
The sound is alright, they match the characters and its common for a girl&#039;s anime.<br />
<br />
The characters are unique, they could be more interesting but its not even close to done airing so we&#039;ll see.<br />
<br />
I somewhat enjoy watching this series but, like i said its not even close to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28468">
        be done airing so we&#039;ll just have to wait and see<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll give this an 8 overall since it can improve and would be a great series if the producers work it out.

    This anime has a total &quot;roleplaying&quot; game feel to it with its characters and the ideas of them going on hired quests to obtain items.<br />
<br />
The story overall is a 9.  I know that isn&#039;t perfect but at the end of episode 4 it just feels right. <br />
<br />
The art is spectacular for a 9. Like I said it has that roleplaying game feel to it.  It just gives me the feel that I am watching a game.<br />
<br />
The voices I think could be a little better though.  But they do have some great voice actors and actresses. <br />
<br />
Characters are well rounded and each has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29477">
        their own part to play in the story.  No one is left out.<br />
<br />
I have to watch episodes 5 &amp; 6 and I am hoping that they can keep the story involved and going.  So far I have really enjoyed what they have created.  <br />
<br />
Overall I give it a 9.  Lets see if they can keep it up.

    I&#039;m quite disappointed in Shukufuku no Campanella. I&#039;ll like to see it as a light-hearted comedy set in a magical world, because what little story and action they have didn&#039;t really matter. I thought it will be better to focus on the characters more since it&#039;s the stronger aspect of the series, but the series had a melodramatic ending that&#039;s along the lines of &quot;our determination will overcome all odds!&quot;... shounen styled, and really wasted a lot of potential the supporting characters had. This feels a lot like the recent Ookami-san, where a lot of screen time is put into introduction of the supporting characters

        which fail to play a real role in the story.<br />
<br />
The main characters were disappointing. Leicester didn&#039;t have any of the energy or manliness the other characters gave him credit for. Carina was nondescript, and Minette were as annoying as hell. I hoped they would have showed more of Chelsea, Agnes and the Tortilla sisters (basically everyone else in the party), but too bad.<br />
<br />
The animation was rather bland and sometimes sloppy. The production quality doesn&#039;t deserve any praise, except maybe for the ending theme. There wasn&#039;t really anything else interesting about the series, so I won&#039;t recommend it.<br />

    Alright, a review of Blessing of the Campanella! *rubs hands together eagerly*<br />
I&#039;m actually a little surprised in myself for actually making this review, but I just recently finished it and I thought it at least deserved a mention of some kind. This was not a groundbreaking anime, nor was it an absolutely horrid one.<br />
<br />
Story: One thing I liked about the story was its setting. Sometimes I&#039;m a sucker for fantasy, which I did not know would be involved in this. So seeing the &#039;Shouseki Monsters&#039; appear, and the group stepping up to the plate to kick some Crystallized demon butt was actually pretty cool. It

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31272">
        starts off with the re-awakening of a young automaton girl named Minette. The concept of an automatan is basically that of a robotic human which is related to the &#039;Eru&#039; that flows in the city. That being said, they really did not elaborate on the purposes of automatan. Minette seemed to act like a normal young girl, so she didn&#039;t perform anything particularly special (even up until the very end.) There also was only maybe 2 or 3 automatans in the entire series: I mean you&#039;d think these things would be important, but I guess not. *shrugs* Alongside this, the real problem did not present itself until the 7th episode, which annoyed me as its about halfway. The last 4 episodes were the most enjoyable of the series for me, so it wasn&#039;t entirely fast-paced either. 5 overall.<br />
<br />
Art: I&#039;ll admit, it was the art that first drew me into watching this show. I looked at the promotional picture and thought, &quot;This looks like a really cute and enjoyable anime.&quot; I didn&#039;t think it looked like anything amazing, but something to just kick back and relax to. This vibe was executed well with the art, and though the designs weren&#039;t the most original of things, I enjoyed it. They also made a good decision when they put in different animations for the ending in the last 4 - 5 episodes. 7!<br />
<br />
Sound: The songs used in this grow on you very quickly. For a majority of the episodes they stick with using one opening (which is fairly catchy.) In one episode they switch openings, and I liked the new one a lot! Weirdly enough it was only for one episode, so that was disappointing. I might want to have these songs on my iPod to listen to occassionally, but its nothing that could get stuck in your head for months on end. In total, I rank it 7!<br />
<br />
Character: Campanella certainly presents forth a lot of interesting characters for the audience to meet. You have a small cheerful automatan girl, a male love interest with almost no flaws, a young sorceress, a shy swordswoman who has no sense of direction, twin sisters (named after salsa and chips), very energetic adults and two people with a goal that proves to be the problem by episode 7. While I didn&#039;t love all of these characters, I did enjoy a great number of them. Chelsea&#039;s bits about getting lost were entertaining, Ritos and Salsa were decent comic relief at times (and their Golem was an all-around great machine), Minette was too adorable and even Carina was a cool character to see on screen, what with her awesome magical abilities and complete jerk of a magical broomstick (er... broom paddle?) That being said, though they were each unique in their own way, they didn&#039;t leave a huge impression on me. Lets just say that of I had to choose a favorite character, it would be Golem. Yes, Golem; a walking wall of a machine with little dialogue over all of those other characters. (But he was still awesome in his own way.) Thus, I give this another 7.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I was originally watching this series as each episode aired weekly, but I kept it on hold after awhile and got back to other shows. In short, its pace was very slow. I was mentally snoozing by my desk at 2 pm when I hit episode 5. However, all things considered, I did enjoy this anime. It ended up how I thought it was going to be: short and sweet. Something to watch and relax, you know? The ending also had a big impact on me; even for me to up my final score of the anime by one point. For Enjoyment, 6!<br />
<br />
Overall: Overall, I&#039;d say this is a 6. Decent: not amazing nor absolutely horrid. Its got good music, interesting enough characters and nice (while not completely original) artwork. Watching this reminded me of watching Chobits back in the day, as the plots and atmospheres are slightly similar. I&#039;d say I liked Chobits more than Campanella for the better-executed story, but they&#039;re very similar.<br />
If you&#039;re looking for something that has all of the previous things mentioned above along with a bit of fanservice (its not horded onto you, thank goodness) and won&#039;t make your brain melt from being confused, I recommend this. =]

    As far as this story goes, I&#039;d say that the entire thing is focus on  the adventures of Minette, a moving doll that look like an average young girl that has emotions and can think for herself (like Pinocchio),  who  has come to life because of some powers emanating from falling meteors and just like a young goose hatching immediately identifies Leicester Maycraft as his &quot;PAPA.&quot;  About the art, I have no qualms about it so I give it a 6 as in fair enough to be appreciated, same with the sound, I kinda like the opening theme. As for the

        characters, well, I don&#039;t have any qualm about their attire, given that the setting is in an alternate world, were people live in harmony with each other, with nature and with the supernatural ( I wish it&#039;s like that in reality). But, I can never understand as to &quot;WHY&quot; does the artist of this anime made Nick La&#039;juck wore a white suit which is something from the discotheque of the 70&#039;s that make him look more like a pimp that a warrior  and what&#039;s with the swords that Chelsea and her holy knights wield, the tip kind of resembles like a nipple of sorts, you might say every sword in this anime has that kind of tip, oh well, I guess the author/ artist simply just wanna add some humor in it ( I think). Anyway, I  like that way Carina Verritti  dress up as a gorgeous mage, same with Chelsea whether she&#039;s in her Holy Knight uniform, in a french maid outfit or naked in the hot tube, I also like the 2 naughty sisters, Ritos and Salsa  Tortilla for their some what kinky but wholesome fashion senses. So overall I give the characters an 8 as in &quot;VERY GOOD&quot; (for the ladies that is, especially in a scene were the ladies are in the bath). The enjoyment of this anime would be very suitable for a middle school kid if the scene from the bath were removed, so a &quot;FAIR&quot; rate is in order, overall I&#039;d say that this anime if fair to be watched both by kids and grown-ups who would be doing the supervision. <br />

Trivia: The first humanoid automata was designed bu an Arabic astronomer/ poly mathematician Al-Jazari during the Islamic Golden Age (Middle Age) in 1206, though it&#039;s function is limited by serving water it pave the way for future  design of automated machines.

    reason i made this review:<br />
<br />
so i was on nhentai, and i stumbled upon this nice doujin with a buxom blonde mage lady and lo and behold, i started having flashbacks of me in my formative years beating it to CG&#039;s from a VN called Blessing of the Campanella, which featured a rather attractive buxom blonde mage lady. <br />
<br />
and i watched the show, and the rest is history. <br />
<br />
this show is the worst fucking anime i&#039;ve ever watched. not in that it&#039;s a terrible show in production quality, etc, but it&#039;s terrible because it&#039;s so, so, so, so bland and mediocre and just fucking BORING. it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272650">
        like if it was parodying the fantasy anime genre....but there was no comedy, and it wasn&#039;t self aware. <br />
<br />
it&#039;s just so horrendously bland and literally the only reason why anyone should even consider blessing of the campanella, is if they&#039;re considering the VN<br />
<br />
which, by the way, is good. why? because it has really good fucking h-scenes, that&#039;s why. so why did they take THE ONLY FUCKING REDEEMING QUALITY FROM THIS SHITPILE AND MAKE IT INTO A GODDAMN FULL LENGTH ANIME<br />
<br />
don&#039;t watch this. who in their right mind would even consider watching this absolutely derivative and trite stain on the ground anyway, just watch re:zero or some other seasonal trash; surely even danmachi has more originality and charm than this sugary, cookie-cutter used tampon

    Shukufuku no Campanella<br />
Genre: Slice of Life, Comedy Magic, Drama, action (minor), Ecchi (Minor)<br />
Length: 12 episodes - 24 minutes each.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d had Shukufuku in my &quot;To-Watch&quot; list for a while. I&#039;d downloaded the Blue-Ray versions, so I knew I was going to be getting an HQ expereince.<br />
<br />
The first thing I wanna say about Shukufuku is it SCREAMS &quot;RPG game&quot;. It&#039;s EXACTLY like an old style RPG or MMO game. You&#039;ve got the character classes (Engineer, Mage, Swordsman, Pupeteer, Berserker etc), a fantasy world, standard monsters and a big boss fight at the end. Know this before you get into it, because it stands SO faithfully to that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91185">
        trope. Which, in my opinion, was a GOOD thing.<br />
<br />
Shukufuku is about a guild in the land of Ert&#039;Aria called &quot;Clan Oasis&quot;. It&#039;s headed up by the pretty mage Carina, and includes the bishounen (and very feminie) main character Leicester (Which is pronouced &quot;Lester&quot; by the way). When a huge burst of magic activates a VERY human like automaton named Minette, who calls Leiceter &quot;Papa&quot;, the Clan takes her in.<br />
<br />
Now, without giving away any plot details, I can tell you that Shukufuku is a very relaxing anime. The quests the guild goes on involve taking on some monsters now and then (so yes, theres action), and then a mildly darker plot involving Minette pans out at episode 7.<br />
<br />
Now down to the review.<br />
<br />
Shukufuku is a really fascintating watch. I&#039;ve never watched anythign that adheres so typicaly to the old RPG style before. Swordsman (Or swordsWOMAN in this case), Pupeteer, engeneer and Mage are all present. 90% of them are female by the way. In fact, only Leicester and the main antagonist are men. Oh and theres &quot;Nick&quot; a Berserker warrior in the guild who&#039;s so unmemorable it took me 5 episodes to remember his name, and everytime he showed up I had to remind myself he existed.<br />
<br />
Shukufuku takes it slow. VERY slow. Theres next-to-no &quot;plot&quot; for 7 episodes. Well there IS plot but its simple quests and adventures that involve taking on low level monsters. In a way, its a very &quot;realistic&quot; aproach to a fantasy world. If you lived in a magical land, it&#039;s NOT going to be monsters, villians and save-the-world adventure everyday like &quot;Fairy Tail&quot; would have you believe. In fact, it&#039;d probebly be quite peaceful, which is what Shukufuku is. For this reason, Shukufuku is more like a &quot;slice-of-life&quot; anime than anything else.<br />
<br />
Shukufuku has a beautiful art style thats soft and uses light colour shades. It&#039;s really well done and definently one of the most appealing parts of the anime.<br />
<br />
Shukufuku moves at a relaxing pace right up until the final episode, which features a host of awesome, high impact action scenes. Unfortunatly, this feels a bit rushed. I really wished they&#039;d had a few more episodes. Hell could have been a 24 episode anime and had a bit more time to develop the final lead in. I was pretty disapointed with the last part of the fight, where for no reason, a holy sword appears infront of the swordsman with no lead in.<br />
<br />
Characters is where Shukufuku shines! Leicester, the male lead, is really likable as a guy. He&#039;s not really like other male protagonist. He&#039;s geninuly a good guy who does his job. He isn&#039;t very strong or overpowered, he&#039;s just inteligent. He&#039;s of the &quot;engeneer&quot; class, he makes things. His weapon is a cool gunblade he made himself. I really like that they made an engenner the main character instead of the swordsman. He&#039;s very relatable. Handsome too, as almost every girl in the series is after him. But thats a given.<br />
<br />
Carina, the cute mage girl and female lead was my personal favorite. Like Leicester, she&#039;s relatable. It&#039;s not like she&#039;s the ultimate mage who excelles at all spells. She&#039;s just a strong spellcaster. That&#039;s about it as well. In terms of physical strength, she&#039;s weak.<br />
She&#039;s the type of character who&#039;s mature and calm about everything. Even when in the fight of her life, she remains calm enough to focus her spells.The only time she ever gets worked up is in a comedic way when another girl gets close to Leicester.<br />
<br />
Of notable mention here are the twin girls Salsa and Ritos. They are a hillerious duo of guild workers who use a stone-mech Golum. Salsa tries her best to do the right thing, but Ritos is detirmed to troll her at every point. It&#039;s so funny, with Salsa getting worked up over Ritos sheer &quot;I don&#039;t give a shit&quot; attitude.<br />
<br />
Sound and music matches the art style fairly well. It&#039;s calming and soft most of the time. It&#039;s not really notable. I barely remember it, so I wouldn&#039;t call it fantastic.<br />
<br />
Oh yes, I almost forgot. Shukufuku is adapted from a hentai eroge, like fate/stay night. It retains a little ecchiness because of this. In reality, it probebly would have worked just to leave the few hentai scenes in. Theres one scene that&#039;s blatently a lead in to a H-scene but is obviously removed.<br />
<br />
Ecchi is limited to a few full-nudity shots in a bathroom or changing-clothes enviroment. It&#039;s good because it feals really &quot;natrual&quot;. Ecchi anime often feature clothes being toarn apart in battle so characters are fighting naked. This doesn&#039;t happen in Shukufuku. (The characters DO take clothing damage, but its not like &quot;oh no, my entire clothes have been destroyed showing off my boobs&quot;. More like &quot;damn, tore my skirt&quot;). It&#039;s not actualy fair to call it an ecchi.<br />
<br />
Overall, Shukufuku no Campanella is enjoyable, but not that memorable. It&#039;s going to stick with me mostly for its chracters and adherence to the RPG style. It&#039;s not an amazing anime, BUT it&#039;s worth a watch. Check this one out if you have some spare time and it sounds like your type of thing. Just know that its going to be a fairly basic ride without a lot of thrills and only simple action.

    Do you love just looking at nice scenes from fantasy worlds? You&#039;d better, otherwise this anime has very little to offer. I&#039;ve actually lost count of how many times I&#039;ve watched it, not because it&#039;s good but because it&#039;s so bland almost all of it gets erased from my memory the moment I watch a single episode of something else.<br />
<br />
Just by reading the plot synopsis your hope for a good story should already be crushed. Keep it that way. Most characters are really forced into roles that don&#039;t work well, as a result their conversations are all over the place and sometimes funny but more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review260887">
        often so disconnected and incoherent it&#039;s like they are locked in their own imaginations and talking past each other. The voice acting isn&#039;t even good, not because the poor folks doing the voices did a bad job but because many of the voices are so poorly matched with the characters you wonder if there was a shortage of options at the time of the making.<br />
<br />
The only enjoyable part about this incoherent bland mess is the art, while the animations are not worth taking an interest in I&#039;m forced to admit the scenes are often lovely. Not overly detailed or outlandish but very fantasy world...ish! Some of the female characters are visually kawaii enough too but their other terrible traits kill that cuteness rather brutally. At the end of the day if all you need are pretty backgrounds and half successful jokes once in a while this anime does the trick, but most viewers could very easily find something else to watch that would suit their tastes better.

    This anime... Is simply just a dead fish.  I can&#039;t even say there was a lot of potential, but there was certainly more than what this anime realized.<br />
<br />
I cannot say anything other than the characters were all stale and uninteresting, the story was slow and predictable, and the music was just mediocre.  It&#039;s only saving grace was the art, but it didn&#039;t save it.  Perhaps the biggest flaw was the stagnant emotion from the characters; this emotion was happy without breaking a smile, or sad with tears, and that was it.  There was no humor, and I mean none.  I

        am not even sure if this anime brought a smile to my face.  The characters were so cliche it was hard to finish it.<br />
<br />
*I am not a very strong critic on anime.  I like more than I should.  Waste your time on this series ONLY if you have A LOT of time to waste.*

    …it’d be a mistake saying that I haven’t watched something like… like THIS for a long time. Similar series have always been, exist now and will be produced with frightening regularity. This title is that most people associate “anime” with.<br />
<br />
The characters are identical. No, seriously, those lame convulsive attempts in showing distinct individuals are done at step “well, there should be a genki, a cooldere, a maid, a moe, an imbecile, a slut… plus a MC-loyal dog, a muscular kern…” – they are missing out only a normal tsundere. Moreover, these guys are so inexpressive, that you can easily confuse one with another. Confuse a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review143905">
        woman with a man. Villains are canonically-overextended, and do canonically repent, receive their forgiveness. It’s a minus, a very big one.<br />
<br />
It goes without saying they all live in a “you know, one standard fantasy world, that has magickas, elffs… errr, I mean dragons” (by the way, an anthropomorphical spectral dragon is so cool). Some kind of the “Eru”(El) flows around the world, and it’s used mostly for giving life to mechanical lolies. Also it creates beautiful meteor showers. Some kind of monsters appear. Yeah. Right. The only bad thing is that the society is retarded, but everything is won-der-ful. Another minus.<br />
<br />
However, this show has its certain beauty. First, GRAFICS. Agnes fap-fap-fap. Those voices make me puke, it’s good that the washbowl is always near. Minette’s voice especially made me getting a vicious dump. The OP&amp;ED give the same impression. EDs, by the way, do change, and thus the emitting vomit is different. A plus for Agnes and her handmade dolls.<br />
There’s no logic in it, but thank you. From time to time they actually try to explain things, just to get the attempts stomped by concrete and straightforward fanservice, the one that makes me dive into the filled washbowl. No one has any motivation at all (yeah, at first the Great Villain was trying to make sense, but eventually stopped that and became “good’). The humor is mostly based on “l00k, the siblings are talking shit, LOL”or “GOOOLEM” (well, this is kinda funny). I have a strong feeling that the connections between episodes were made up during a mortal hangover. If that’s the case, I go stand up and applaud. But it’s a minus, actually.<br />
<br />
Now’s my favorite part – the story itself. You know, it kina exists. And kinda not. The minute is starts to appear, say, Minette goes to the market. Or say the Great Villain makes his appearance, threatening everyone – the next episode starts off a celebration on something. “The chance for you to succeed is less than 1%”, as it’s stated in the final – and it’s obvious that instead everything runs like clockwork. “mamoru nakama” all the time. “I’ll save everyone”, my ass. And he does. Some characters are only for show… well, not “some” – everyone but two. And those two are the most plain and stupid. The story itself negates all the attempts of getting a grasp of it. It the authors had a goal of making one incoherent ravings, they did a perfect job. Somehow, I’m in a doubt on that, thus one more minus.<br />
<br />
To sum everything up… I watched this only an episode a month, because I have only three washbowl at my house. And they have to be cleaned up after each session. However, the overall impression isn’t that bad – I was dying from a handover a week ago, and felt much more sick. Maybe it’s all because of me overdosing myself with too much pure alcohol. Anyway, this was a great torture for choosing a bad anime. As if I didn’t know that coming. I even can’t compliment this on anything except Agnes.<br />
<br />
3/10, yet the real mark is two – thank one cute little girl for that.<br />
