    Alright, since all the reviews here are full of bullshit and too long to read I had to make one of my own. The anime had potential but at around the first girl they messed up bad, it was a major turn-off and since then it only got worse. The anime is really cliche and generic. It&#039;s awkward and boring. The main character is useless like in most of the anime these days. I don&#039;t recommend it, but if you are bored and you have nothing better to do with your life then it sure is a good way of wasting your time.

    This review contains mild spoilers. <br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Seiren offers an insurance policy against the inherent risk of harem anime. You don&#039;t have to worry about best girl getting her heart torn to shreds by some milktoast dude choosing the worst possible option. Instead, the milktoast dude chooses every single option in different timelines. Everybody wins!....or do they?<br />
<br />
What Seiren gains in having multiple routes it loses in meaningful character progression. You won&#039;t feel the ultimate satisfaction from watching two lovers grow together over a dozen episodes nor is there any conflict to set up an emotional payoff. This problem is further compounded by boring character designs barely distinguishing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243255">
        each heroine from the other and the bizarre decision to not have the most interesting girl, Hikari, end up in a relationship with Shouichi. She decides it&#039;s more important to focus on her career and never talks to him again until a random five year timeskip where they run into each other in a shop, The End.<br />
<br />
Shouichi is your standard harem protagonist with zero motivations, zero backbone and zero backstory explaining his personality. There&#039;s absolutely nothing going on in his life aside from these random hot girls who want his dick. There&#039;s no reason to give a fuck about him and his relationships. Why should anyone root for his success?<br />
<br />
In Seiren&#039;s spiritual predecessor Amagami SS, lead character Junichi got stood up by a date on Christmas. The pain from that night gave him a complex about being rejected. We as viewers were given a reason to cheer for his success, bringing a level of catharsis to each arc where he got over his mental hurdle. Amagami SS had better arc resolutions, better designs, 26 more episodes to explore it&#039;s concept and most importantly - better girls. There is more personality in the hair of Kaoru than anyone in Seiren altogether.<br />
<br />
There is still merit in watching Seiren if you desire a basic eroge game styled rom com. The girls are cute. The OP/ED themes are catchy. There are certainly some beautiful moments, most notably the underwater kiss in episode 4. Seiren has good qualities, they&#039;re just interspersed in an overwhelming dredge of crap that only the most tolerant of romance fans can hope to shift through. If you aren&#039;t in that crowd - avoid this like the plague and go re-watch Amagami &amp; Kimi Kiss Pure Rouge for your fix of a satisfy all romance anime.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
Brace yourself, this is basically a long rant. My beliefs and score are subject to change as the anime goes on.<br />
<br />
First of all, I WAS excited for this anime, just as I was excited watching Amagami SS. They both follow the Visual Novel-esque story telling that allows each main girl to have their ending with the main character. Unfortunately, Seiren disappointed me throughout the entire first arc, and I will probably drop it if the second arc doesn&#039;t impress me. I&#039;ll be reviewing in order of (personal) importance, as always spoiler alert.<br />
<br />
ART- 4: The art is fairly standard. Warm colors with light

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239282">
        tones for the characters and backgrounds. The main male characters look fairly generic and the female main characters actually seem pretty pleasant, if a little bland. There&#039;s nothing off about the art, but nothing &quot;great&quot; either.<br />
<br />
MUSIC - 3: The fact that I don&#039;t remember any of the music/didn&#039;t stop during scenes to comment on it means it wasn&#039;t really memorable in the first place. Nothing really stood out.<br />
<br />
STORY/CHARACTER (Their problems go hand in hand) - 2: <br />
Here&#039;s where it really starts to fall off.  Amagami SS explains the protagonist&#039;s backstory, it helps sets the pace for his intentions. There is no &quot;backstory&quot; for any character whatsoever, motivations are set as &quot;I&#039;m a high school student who doesn&#039;t know what I want to do in life.&quot; It&#039;s a fairly bland and common story, nothing super unique. The story seems to be the MC learning what he wants in life through his experiences with his love interests.  Although this isn&#039;t a bad story in and of itself, it is presented terribly. Most of the MC&#039;s initial aspirations come off as half-assed. Not only that, the influence from his love interest is minimal (at best), and hardly pointed out throughout his supposed &quot;growth&quot;. As for &quot;growth&quot; I&#039;ll separate it as best I can, &quot;character development&quot; and &quot;relationship development.&quot;<br />
<br />
For character development, the female lead (Tsuneki) gets absolutely no development whatsoever until the last episode of the arc. At this point she suddenly decides that everything she went through for the MC helped her figure out her calling in life. The MC, on the other hand, is completely inconsistent throughout the story, and many of his actions hardly make sense until the very end.<br />
<br />
In a romance anime, the relationship development aspect of the story is the most important. Their interest is made expressly clear throughout the episodes. The progress they make is mainly shown through random outbursts the MC has that make Tsuneki blush, and Tsuneki randomly flirting with the MC and doing things for him a mother or wife would do.  They do have some cute moments, but nothing I could consider &quot;progress&quot; until the very last episode where they kiss and talk about the future. <br />
<br />
If the main progress in a character (Tsuneki specifically) AND a relationship comes in the last episode, it spells a recipe for disaster. That is simply what the story and characters are. The premise is bland, the development is close to nonexistent, the MC is inconsistent and I see no reason why she falls for him.<br />
<br />
The worst part is, by far, the &quot;closure&quot; of the first arc. Seiren threw Amagami&#039;s &quot;closure endings&quot; out the fucking window with a friend-zoned MC and a &quot;Fateful encounter years away with no real conclusion.&quot; I understand the whole &quot;open-ended, you make your own ending&quot; thing but it literally throws what little progress they made into the air and crumbling back down. It&#039;s an entire reset to their relationship, which rarely works.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT - 3: You really think after coming this far I&#039;m gonna say I &quot;enjoyed&quot; it? Nope. I&#039;ve enjoyed medical procedures more than going through this cringe worthy mess of a story.<br />
<br />
OVERALL - 3: Absolutely nothing in the anime goes above what I can describe as &quot;decent&quot;, and the most important aspects of a romance story ended up as the worst offenders. I&#039;m dreading continuing it and may change this review depending on the future stories, but at the moment I can&#039;t say anything good about this anime. <br />
<br />

    I felt compelled to write a review simply because of all the negative reviews. The negative reviews are absurd for this anime. Most sound entitled simply because the characters and plot didn&#039;t go according to how they wanted them to go or meet their benchmark expectations. <br />
<br />
The reality is, if you can&#039;t go into a new anime without expectations or comparing to some of your other liked anime, you&#039;ll never enjoy it. The anime is still on-going so I&#039;ll provide the critique I have so far. <br />
<br />
Art: Nothing special, but nice. The characters do have a unique look to them, a little sharp on the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239754">
        edges, but nothing to complain about. It&#039;s enjoyable art. <br />
<br />
Plot: The plot has been nice. It&#039;s a High School Romance setting with a sprinkle of Slice of Life. The story develops smoothly and naturally. The protagonist is a cringe-watching character that gets nervous around girls. His main focus is on graduation exams but encounters a girl that playfully teases him. Due to pretty realistic events that could be seen in real life, both characters are put in situations to develop their relationship. They slowly, but naturally began to develop feelings for each other. First as friends and then as something in between a confession and friendship. The plot highly focuses on the development of their relationship so that&#039;s what&#039;s special about the first few episodes. Although it does not lead to anything, I think that is the uniqueness of the plot.<br />
<br />
This is not a plot that jumps around or with a random sudden romance. <br />
<br />
Characters: The two main characters are the stars here obviously. The characters eventually develop romantic feelings towards each other, but what&#039;s nice about it is that&#039;s it&#039;s pretty realistic and natural through continued interaction and getting to know each other. Unintentional and unexpectedly, the female character develops these feelings. The guy already had some kind of feelings for her with low expectations, though. A friendship seemed as his expectations. As hints and signs develop, things seem like they&#039;re going to go somewhere, but they don&#039;t. People might be upset about that, but is something that can definitely happen for the reason it did happen. <br />
<br />
Everyone else does a good job in their roles. Characters show humor, kindness, jealousy, interest, etc. It&#039;s a fun watch and would recommend so far.

    Teenage hormones are a powerful thing. The trials and tribulations we went through in our adolescence involving relationships and such can seem trivial by comparison to our current lives, but when we were in the moment they seemed so monumental. Whether it was timidly asking a girl out for the first time, or the lucidity and nostalgia of a summer romance, not much can compare to our teen years. Seiren randomly popped up on my radar before the winter season started (probably due to the plethora of attractive female character models), and after its conclusion I can assuredly say two things:<br />
<br />
As a married man in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243259">
        my late twenties, I am clearly not this show’s intended audience<br />
Being a teenager is awkward, and it doesn’t translate to quality entertainment<br />
<br />
“Seiren”, meaning honest in Japanese, is just that. It tells three girl-centered anecdotes from highschooler Shouichi Kamita’s life, a life in which there are plenty of perverted inner monologues and awkward exchanges with females. The writing is actually pretty accurate given the subject matter, but it doesn’t make the anime any better. Kamita gets nervous around basically every girl he meets (surprise!), with a relatively introverted attitude and a love for gaming. He’s also not that great of a student, or good at pretty much anything he does.. So he’s essentially the anti-Gary Stu character. Each story gradually develops a teenage romance, one scene at a time. Although the result of each relationship is often disappointing or lackluster, the buildup is the real focus of the writing.<br />
<br />
As boring or predictable as Seiren is, the writing is quite accurate. Whether it’s the slow burn of the romance itself or the fickle nature of Kamita’s female counterparts, the writers nail teens in a nutshell. Awkward, irrational and hormonal. That’s not to say that Seiren has a “good” story, because there’s only so much enjoyment one can have in watching two people fumble over themselves for 20 minutes at a time. There’s lots of eye-rolling to be had here. Not to mention the melodrama is thicker than Chun-Li’s thighs. Oh, and the constant blushes emblazoned on the face of Kamita and his peers is mind numbing.<br />
<br />
The main problem I have with Seiren is that the subject matter is just, dull. There&#039;s quite a bit less comedic dialogue than a normal slice of life, and the relationship building and love scenes aren&#039;t nearly as strong as a romance anime. It&#039;s essentially having the worst of both worlds, which for entertainment’s sake, is never a good thing. Would you want to watch a show about your awkward teenage years with lots of missed connections, social inebriation and awkward conversations? I think not. It&#039;s why we get older and grow up (at least some of us do), and I can&#039;t imagine many of us would care to relive that profound age of existence. It&#039;d be one thing if the relationships “went” anywhere, but again they are stifled by abrupt changes in the way someone “feels” about moving forward. That or the writers play out “what-if” scenarios in which Kamita succeeds in his apparent life goal of becoming a school bus driver. I can&#039;t make this stuff up.<br />
<br />
Character wise, Seiren makes an attempt at creating diverse and complex characters. Unfortunately the anime falters in this respect as well. Although Kamita represents an awkward high school teenager decently, this is the same old character trope we&#039;ve seen time and time again. He&#039;s virtually indistinguishable from some other SoL protagonist I&#039;ve seen in the past, and the repetition is really starting to get tiresome. Tsuneki is quite easily the most dynamic character in the entire series. She&#039;s popular, pretty and wants everyone to know it, most notably Kamita… who for some outlandish reason she acts like a tsundere to. Apparently all it takes for her to fall for him is a few gauche interactions at a summer study camp and him accidentally popping a boner in the men&#039;s washroom. But this sizzling romance is quickly extinguished when Tsuneki makes the abrupt announcement that she wants to pursue life as a chef… which evidently can&#039;t involve boys whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Next up Tooru Miyame, or as I like to refer to her: every teenage pizza-faced nerd’s unicorn. A hot girl that plays videogames, and is actually good at it? Not to mention that she’s single and ready to mingle with our main protagonist? Ok, this one is straight up in fantasyland. Through my time in YouTube I&#039;ve actually met some decent looking girls who are into gaming, so that part’s not entirely out of the question. The most implausible factor is how easily she is drawn to the charismatic Ken doll himself. The writers attempted to use the two character’s common interest of video games to create a relationship between them. The result? Unbelievable at best. They even go as far as to paint a future with a child involved at the conclusion of the arc. This is just bad writing. <br />
<br />
Lastly, we have the obligatory “young crush”. Every guy that&#039;s ever become a senior in high school can admit to having an interest in a younger girl. That&#039;s just how testosterone works. In effect, the storyline is probably the most believable of all three. A cute underclassmen shows up, is extremely impressionable and wants to experience the elusive romance she&#039;s read about in teenage manga. The result is a morally questionable relationship that is never meant to go anywhere and spawns a “what if?” scenario of its own. The least entertaining of the three arcs, but probably the most believable. It&#039;s a shame they saved it for last.<br />
<br />
The animation and art style in Seiren is attractive in some scenes and dull in others. The inconsistent nature of this plagues the side characters because their models are virtually carbon copies of each other. This could make for some confusing moments in the series where you&#039;re not entirely sure who&#039;s talking at a given moment. Luckily the girls are pretty cute, which is what I think initially brought me to the show. It&#039;s okay, but we should be a bit more detailed in 2017.<br />
<br />
The sound is pretty atrocious. Neither the opening or the endings were really that convincing in making me want to watch the show, in the background music is virtually absent. The voice acting is mediocre, and really could&#039;ve benefited from having a big-name actor accompanied to the anime. It was like listening to the lite version of your standard slice of life series.<br />
<br />
Unless you&#039;re a glutton for punishment, or really enjoy watching teenagers stumble over there words professing their love for each other, I would say avoid Seiren at all costs. It can be quite boring at times, and there isn&#039;t anything in service to take your mind off of things. Combine this with blend art in nonexistent music and you have a recipe for a snoozer. this is not a show I can recommend to anyone, and is possibly the worst series I watched this season. As always, thanks for checking out the review and be sure to look out for my other winter 2017 reviews this is not a show I can recommend to anyone, and is possibly the worst series I watched this season.

    If I had two words to describe Seiren, one would be “uninspired” and the other would be “bizarre”. I’ll be honest, I’m one of those consumers that values unquantifiable things like creativity, innovation and, if at the right time, something that pushes the boundaries of the medium.<br />
<br />
I don’t expect all shows to have this sort of thing, after all part of why I value those things is because of their sparsity within the medium. More often than not I just come across shows that have varying extents of those things and that’s definitely serviceable; I’m not expecting every show I watch to be the next

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243507">
        Mushishi or Millennium Actress. Every shows at least nudges some kind of boundary within the medium and that alone is usually somewhat entertaining to watch.<br />
<br />
But let me just say that the only boundaries Seiren pushes are the number of fetishes it can pander to. Boobs and ass are the prerequisites, but legs, feet, navels, urophilia, coprophilia, plushophilia, exhibitionism, BDSM, and whatever the scientific term is for arousal from chicks that look like animals. <br />
<br />
As I said before Seiren is bizarre, it’s this high school romance show with a mixture of issues that range from inherently poor writing to flatout awful production—the way these episodes are organized and put together don’t even work as a saving grace for the show. Hell even the art quality goes to shit quickly. But this incongruous mixture of issues pulls out a show with just some bizarre moments… Man, I consider myself to have a fairly strong command of the English language, but I can’t help but keep circling back to this same word. It’s not even bizarre in an overt fashion like JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure or anything, it’s just these subtle bizarrities that spawn from things like retconning or overall poor writing. <br />
<br />
Characters who are introduced to be petty and resentful, and warned about with lines like “oh you don’t want to get on her bad side, otherwise all the girls in the school will be against you” suddenly turn into magnanimous priests who bestow forgiveness upon those whose sins include lying, betrayal and infidelity. Things like that could really be justified with a small shard of personality, but because of lack of oversight it’s not thought about at all, and when they play out towards the end of arcs it just comes off as bizarre.<br />
<br />
Another example of a bizarrity within the show that really got me laughing was when Kamita nonchalantly pulls out a fucking PSP from his trousers and starts googling the meaning of words mid-conversation. Like, if the Googling of things mid-conversation isn’t strange enough, why is he doing it on a freakin PlayStation Portable? What happened to smartphones? Then it’s put away and never mentioned again. What the hell? Why include strange things that raise questions and not address them? Who goes to school with a PSP in their trouser pocket?<br />
<br />
The shows omnipanderance also compounds onto its already bizarre subtleties, you’ll have a character walking down the street, seemingly musing an innocuous thought that actually turns out to be a BDSM-fetish fantasy, and it’s just dismissed as normal! Where does this come from!? <br />
<br />
The protagonist Kamita is a pussy, for a lack of a better word. Actually, there are plenty of better words, but I’m gonna keep calling him a pussy because this major league dork will cum in his pants at the slightest interaction with a girl. Girl does his laundry? Girl brushes her arm against him? Girl shows her bellybutton? Oh this is too much! I’m gonna bust! I legitimately hate Kamita because he represents this trend of anime protagonists that collectively form a malignant tumor within the medium, metastasizing throughout each and every genre whilst promoting this “stuttering, breathless beta-male gets hot chicks” agenda of sorts that is honestly just dreadful. Seriously, fuck this guy.<br />
<br />
The show’s 12 episodes are evenly divided into three separate arcs, all involving a different female lead, with the a convenient time reset after each arc ends. This division of episodes is much better in theory than it is in practice, because for some reason studio Gokumi thought it was logical to begin with the best girl and then just regress into more and more generic leads and arcs as the show progresses. The first girl Tsuneki is by far the best in the entire show as she possesses a rare trait the other girls do not: a distinct personality.<br />
<br />
Tsuneki is unique and dynamic, a character that exudes confidence and terrifying levels of spontaneity, always keeping you on your toes and wary of her next actions. She’s frisky and intimate, and is a character you won’t easily find in any other high school romance show. What this show does with her and her arc is not only laughably bad, but also just straight up bizarre. After Tsuneki it’s all downhill, the female leads just become more and more generic as the show progresses.<br />
<br />
The next girl is Tooru, that one girl who has a smooth voice, and is cool, calm and collected at most times. She’s also a gamer girl, which apparently constitutes “original” in the eyes of studio Gokumi.<br />
<br />
The finale female lead, I think her name is Kyoko or something (who actually cares) is by far the most generic; it’s like the writers just gave up at this point. A soft-spoken, innocent childhood friend who’s only meaningful development is understanding that yes, taking a male, childhood friend to shop for lingerie with you is indeed weird, and so is asking him if those rose-coloured panties look good on you. <br />
<br />
If you hadn’t already guessed it, one of Seiren’s biggest problems is, like many other anime, pacing. Four episodes doesn’t give anyone much room to work with when trying to develop a natural, romantic relationship between two leads. Trying to replicate something as special as the blooming of love takes care and time, it’s something that stems from allowing characters to bounce thoughts and emotions off of one another and letting intangible things like their chemistry develop naturally. The spontaneity of the first girl, Tsuneki, made that task marginally easier, but four episodes is simply not enough. It’s frankly a little depressing how they took a great character with a stellar character design and an outstanding voice actress and threw it all out the window by trying to rush her whole relationship with Kamita in four episodes. <br />
<br />
Seiren is an uninspired, bizarre, clichéd high school romance show that manages to follow virtually every convention one would come to expect from the genre, only ever subverting it in unrealistic, often cringeworthy ways that leave you questioning the bizarrity of what you just watched. It is simply lame, pointless, represents many of the horrible trends in this medium and somehow adds onto that list with its incessant omni-pandering to fetishes. I wouldn’t recommend this show to anybody. <br />
<br />
I hope this review was informative and helpful. And maybe got you to smile a bit as well.<br />

    Seiren, one of the anime that will never have the chance to rise to the surface. All of the reviews on the main page are totally against this anime, even the rating itself is below seven. Those made me skeptical at first, but I binged it anyway. And to my surprise, it was actually a great watch. It made me seriously think of never judging an anime by its rating again.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I thought this show would be a generic harem by looking at the cover, but I was on the wrong side. It’s actually way more amusing than that. This anime is the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407604">
        first non-harem romance anime where the MC gets to date three different main heroines. Don’t get me wrong here, each of them has its own routes. Simply put, this anime has three divergent routes with different main heroines in each of it.<br />
<br />
The reason I’m in love with this anime is because it’s different from what I’ve watched so far. Only in this show, I can get a clear idea on what to expect when the MC encounters three completely different main heroines. It gets exciting everytime the route changes. However, there’s one thing that’s been bothering me. Because the show has to split three arcs in only twelve episodes, I never get the chance to absorb myself that much to the story. Come to think of it, in each route, the first three episodes are where the MC approaches the main heroine and in the last episode, the main heroine gets confessed. Later in the episode, there will be a time skip, years ahead to where they’re already husband and wife. Don’t you think it’s a bit rushed? <br />
<br />
As for the characters, I think they’re very likeable. Each of them has their own unique approach to the MC. Hikari, the first main heroine, is an annoying senpai who likes to mess around with her classmates, including the MC. She’s so popular that everyone in her class adores her.  Miyamae, the second main heroine, is the complete opposite of Hikari. She doesn’t have any friends, but there’s one thing she’s good at, which is playing games. The last and the most interesting main heroine is Kyouko. Apparently, she is the childhood friend of the MC. As you know, in almost all anime, childhood friends never win, right? Well, at least in the last arc, the childhood friend gets to win the MC’s heart. <br />
<br />
Overall, I think this anime is worth the watch. I didn’t regret spending my last two days of summer holiday watching this. I recommend everyone to watch it. As a reminder, this show might be confusing if you haven’t read the synopsis already.<br />

    I was looking forward to this show. Not because of the content, the content seemed to be your standard toolkit for escapism and wish fulfillment for a certain subset of the viewer base (the opening makes that very clear), but because of the fact that this is the only original anime that I know of to adopt the omnibus format. The omnibus format is essentially where the anime diverges from one point in time to show multiple &#039;what-if&#039; scenarios. In Seiren&#039;s case, the format shows us multiple arcs, each independent from each other, where the MC becomes involved with a certain girl in each arc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seiren

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239204">
        is more or less an indirect sequel to Amagami SS (which I dropped), an anime that adopted the same format. I have to admit, Seiren is better than I expected. The story was compelling enough to make me want to watch it; watching it didn&#039;t feel like a chore. The tone is quite lighthearted and considering the tone of Amagami, we can safely assume this will continue to be the case. I also liked the direction the fourth episode took (the concluding episode of the first arc). <br />
<br />
The characters actually had some semblance of depth to them. Sure, a lot of the moments had me rolling my eyes, but hell, I feel like rolling my eyes when I think of my teenage years, so it&#039;s only natural i&#039;d feel the same when watching an anime set in high school. If anything, i&#039;d say that is a sign of good writing. <br />
<br />
The fan service wasn&#039;t as off putting as I thought it would be. It actually didn&#039;t feel that tacked on, which was surprising considering they seemed to have (if memory serves) ramped up the fan service from Amagami <br />
<br />
The character designs have the same problem as Amagami. Some girls, particularly the minor characters, are drawn so similar sometimes that it is hard to tell them apart (especially since you don&#039;t see certain characters often). The art is good otherwise. <br />
<br />
The music hardly had a presence. It might be this series&#039; weakest point. The OP and ED are nothing to write home about either. <br />
<br />
To conclude, I think that Seiren might turn out to be better than Amagami. I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll be anything that special, but I hope it leads us to getting more original anime that use the omnibus format. <br />
<br />
***Update: I ended up dropping Seiren. It was just mediocore. <br />

    Omnibus Format,  is a type of story-telling that divides the whole series into multiple arcs each dedicated to a certain girl which the main characters gets a romantic relationship with. When an arc concludes, everything resets back to the beginning with an all new storyline and characters to follow. The most well-known series that features this kind of story-telling is Amagami SS which is pretty much the spiritual predecessor to our newest addition Seiren. Seiren, an original series made in collaboration with Studio Gakumi and Studio AXsiZ, aired this Spring 2017 is the newest series to feature omnibus format of story-telling. I personally think

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243425">
        that Amagami SS is a good show so I was pretty hyped when Seiren was announced but honestly, it didn’t live up to my expectations. There were a lot of flaws that I’ve noticed all throughout the show. To explain further let’s just start the review.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story follows Shoichi Kamita as he develops relationship with different girls during high school. Each girl is dedicated to their own arc which follows a unique storyline. A single arc is composed of four episodes each and tells how the main character gets involved into that certain girl, how they developed their relationship and how they ended up in the future. Yeah you heard that right, all of that content in only four episodes. But that isn’t really the problem and even if that wasn’t the case, I’d still be bothered anyways. None of the storylines that the arcs followed are compelling or even interesting.  Each of them has their own fair share of weirdness and cringe. And the conflicts that serves to brighten up the storyline makes little to no sense at all. Fan service is seemingly dominant and the amount of romantic scenes that can establish a concrete relationship between the characters is lacking. With regards to characters development, you can’t really expect much from a show that features an omnibus format of story-telling. Though I can tell, the character development is somewhat there but you can’t really feel it knowing that after the reset, all the connections between the viewers and the characters will all be lost anyways. Viewers who are new with omnibus format will probably encounter this problem but those who have watched similar shows firsthand will probably be fine with it. But beyond all of this, there’s something I’d like to point out and is something that I really praise from the show. Even if the arc that a character is dedicated to is already over, the characters still appear in considerable amount of screen time and throughout the following arc. They appear merely as supporting characters but with quite relevance with the storyline. This feels as if the characters are given a lot of importance. But I guess this is possible because Seiren is an original and not a visual novel adoption unlike other anime of the same league. <br />
<br />
Characters<br />
The main character of the show is just your typical beta mc that always blushes to whatever a girl does in front of her. There’s really no revealing trait to mention for the main character. He’s just your generic harem main character though I can’t really say that this show is a harem. So having a generic main character, it’s clear enough that the female characters should lead the show. The female characters are likable and appealing. Their character itself is just the right stuff to compensate what the main character lacked. As I mentioned, characters relationship in this show will come and go but not the characters themselves. There’s a really good set of supporting characters that really stood out to me during the whole show. They add up to the overall vibe of the show. So other than the main character, I don’t have any problem when it comes to the characters.<br />
<br />
Art <br />
There are some parts where the art shines and some parts it lacks. In general, the art is very vibrant. There are some notable parts where the animation will just blew you away. And the amount of detail is just right though a little bit more could have been better.  The character designs are also quite attractive. It pretty much reminds me of Amagami SS. Though unlike Amagami SS, I’ve noticed there’s not enough distinction between the characters. All the female characters have similar hair and the facial expressions are pretty much the same with all the characters. It’s really hard to recognize a character at first glance. But this isn’t much of a problem and I let it slide all the time. And still, I can say I liked the art of this show.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
There’s really not much to talk about when it comes to sounds. There’s really no memorable soundtrack that comes in mind when I think of it. The opening theme of the show is quite nice. The closing theme changes every arc. There’s nothing more to it that I’ve noticed other than these.<br />
<br />
Overall, I don’t think Seiren is a bad show. Maybe I expected a lot more but there are really a lot of obvious flaws in this show.  But I can’t say I didn’t enjoy this show. With all the laughs and weirdness this show offered to me, I say I enjoyed it quite a bit. So far, there are only three arcs featured in this show but it seems that there’s supposed to be more. If ever there will be a second season for this show, I’d give it another change.<br />

    Seiren is a very visual novel-esc anime. Each story arc revolves around a romance with one of three different girl, Hikari Tsuneki, Tooru Miyamae, and Kyoko Touno.<br />
<br />
Story(6)- there isn&#039;t much for story here, it&#039;s just a romance series. the series is spit into three arcs. Each ending with the main character ending up with the individual girl, and the story restarts in the next arc. It doesn&#039;t go right back to the beginning, but rather after the point where the next romance option would come up. I can tell that the second and third arcs have some connection. I never really saw where Arc 2

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243540">
        fit into there, but whatever. We know how each story will  end to a point. We don&#039;t know the specific ending or how we get to it. This story is fairly sweet at many points. I also really love how it&#039;s colder in the third arc, because it&#039;s around Christmas time, and I believe that the cold season is the PERFECT season for Romance. Something about the clothes, art, and the air just scream romance.<br />
<br />
Art(8)-Now to talk about the art. I really like the character designs. They look very nice, but nows to talk about the fanservice. There&#039;s fanservice here, BUT the fanservice isn&#039;t silly stuff like jiggle physics, and the more unreasonable. It&#039;s more realistic, like cosplay, swimsuits, or being able to see through the clothes a bit when in the water. They also use more detailed art in order to make the fanservice look good. I would also like to point out the amazing opening, that had some fantastic direction. Where it would show the girls and then they&#039;d transform into test followed by shots of the girls doing whatever. That part where Shoichi kisses whoever is behind the curtain is also really good, because it show how the three girls&#039; look pretty different, but have the same base design. That flowers in the opening were also really nice. The endings for the show also had really nice, visual novel-esc artwork, which is a nice touch.<br />
<br />
Sound(8)- I LOVE the music in this show. My favorite piece is the opening, which might be my favorite opening from Winter 2017. I enjoy the endings as well. I can&#039;t remember them perfectly though. I enjoy the litle bits of background music that are here as well. The music here was done by Nobuaki Nobusawa, who did the music for series like Lord Marksman and Vanadis, Dagashi kashi, and Cerberus. This was my first encounter with him though.<br />
<br />
Character(9)- Now I will bring up that the main character, Shoichi, is very self-insert, which would be bad  in a series with dramatic stakes, but it&#039;s fine here, because the main focus is the heroins of the series. None of them are Tsunderes, Yanderes, Derederes, etc, etc. They do fall under a few archetypes, like popular girl, or childhood friend, but they have very likable personalities, and I would say that I would be interested in all three of them. Shout out to Hikari Tsuneki, who is best girl. She&#039;s a likable character, and probably the most important, because she&#039;s in every Arc, and its not just a cameo either, she plays a certain purpose in arcs 2 and 3. Even after her Arc had ended though, I could still route for the other characters to end up together, but Tsuneki is my personal favorite. I like the side characters as well, even if some of them were kind of weird in little ways, I had still enjoyed most of them. My favorites being Moene, Shoichi&#039;s older sister, and  Ikuo, Shoichi&#039;s best friend. I did find a few characters annoying, but they mostly fell under reason, as they would be people I&#039;d find annoying in real life. I&#039;ll note that Shoichi does have some weird fetishes, but it&#039;s fairly standard for your average teenage boy.<br />
<br />
Enjoyement(9)- I really enjoyed this series, and it&#039;s a shame that so many people have been hating on it, because its a nice show to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall(8)- I think Seiren is nice series to enjoy. It&#039;s nothing grounbreaking, but its certainly enjoyable. I recommend trying the first 4 episodes before making a clear decision on it.

    Recently, I read a manga about a geezer becoming young again through &quot;magic&quot;. It was essentially a pseudo-reincarnation. Easiest way to spot a power fantasy. <br />
<br />
Anyway, geezer decides to drown us in nostalgia by setting up and ruling a dungeon like in RPGs of old. He summons a hot demon to oversee the construction. The hero (female) arriving to stop him is won over within a chapter. &quot;Ugly&quot; slave girl given to him as tribute is made beautiful in one fricking panel. Sounds typical? It is. Except he bangs all the girls.<br />
<br />
And boom, best harem MC ever. This turd is essentially Kirito in every form,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240977">
        but that one is bland writing, while here we have &#039;nothing but respect for this MC&#039;. That is honestly the top comment on a chapter on Kissmanga. With 200+ upvotes. Just because, sex.<br />
<br />
This just shows the mentality regarding bland MC&#039;s. If you want to check out the manga, I don&#039;t blame you, honestly.<br />
<br />
So, Seiren. I could say it is a sweet romance. I could say 4 episodes is just right, without pointless rivals and irritating love shapes. I could say the art is decent, and the girls cute. <br />
 On the other hand, I could say it is nothing new. The girls all fall neatly into tropes we&#039;ve seen before. I could say the characters are inconsistent wrt personality. I could say there is no romance or drama for a lot of the runtime, potentially making this a snoozefest.<br />
I can say a lot of things, but most of them would be invalidated by the herbivore of a MC. <br />
<br />
Dull, self insert MC&#039;s are the cancer of today&#039;s anime for many. Not the self-insert part, mind you. Onii-sama has 4k favorites. No, having a dull MC is the death knell of a show nowadays. Seiren is no different. Hard to care about his romance when the character is the definition of &#039;boring&#039;.<br />
<br />
Apparently, this sells in Japan. So we&#039;ll get more of such shows. There&#039;s nothing we can do. Or is there?<br />
You got me, this is not a review, but a petition for everyone to buy 10 copies of Inferno Coppu.  If it succeeds, studios take notice of it and we get more MC&#039;s on the level of Inferno Coppu. If it doesn&#039;t, you have 10 copies of the greatest thing to ever come out of the anime medium. <br />
It&#039;s a win-win honestly.<br />
Till this revolution occurs, the only winners will be the studios making money of average titles like Seiren.<br />
<br />
Say no to mediocrity. Buy Inferno Cop today.

If you&#039;re looking for a staple omnibus format anime akin to the likes of Amagami SS, this anime is for you. Every four-episode arc is indicative of a distinct route the protagonist takes with a different girl who he becomes initially acquainted with, ultimately leading to a specific culmination of experiences with that very girl. <br />
<br />
The first arc is with Tsuneki, and the second is with Miyamae Tooru.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, the first arc could have been a bit better, but the route is quite respectful of realistic occurrences. The second arc, however, is a much better journey, and sets a high standard for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241312">
        subsequent arc. The sublime artwork and distinctly paced episodic storyline is a fresh, albeit not completely out-of-the-box, take on the genre this anime belongs to. <br />
<br />
You&#039;ll only know if you like the anime if you watch it. But do remember, the second arc (Episodes 5-8) is far better than the first one (1-4) - so expect to like some arcs much more than the other.

    I went into this anime as a full-on Amagami SS fan. Something nice with great romance progression and a cute story. I was happy when I found out that Amagami was getting well...an alternate as one can say.<br />
<br />
This review will be edited as each arc finishes.<br />
<br />
Was I satisfied? Well...yes and no.<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s why.<br />
<br />
We have the setting to be set somewhat set in the same highschool from Amagami. NGL I was expecting some sort of cameos from Amagami characters. (Unless there was and I didnt see, if there was, tell me)<br />
<br />
Tsuneki Hikari, Or should I say, Haruka 2.<br />
Both have similar designs, and in a way, similar personalities

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239674">
        (although I tend to find Hikari just a smudge hotter than haruka..Just a smudge) She is the first girl out of the 3 arcs.<br />
<br />
Was I satisfied with the Romance? Not really. Even so, I did enjoy the way the MC and Hikari interacted with eachother. But with only 4 episodes to work with, the romance progression or the character progression was pretty hard to try and pull off. There was little to no progression between the 2 characters. Then again, this is only 4 episodes, but Amagami was able to do some nice development in 4 eps.<br />
<br />
but that doesn`t mean I was dissatisfied...<br />
I had fun with this arc, I liked the characters and I loved some of the conversations they had. Even if there was very little progression, I had my fair enjoyment of this arc.<br />
<br />
In conclusion..I guess, I just wanted more so that there was more room for romance progression, plot progression, and character development. <br />
<br />
Here`s hoping that the Tooru arc will be good. She`s the one I`m looking most forward to.

    -I&#039;m sorry for all mistakes, english isn&#039;t my native language-<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start right off the bat. I&#039;m enjoying Seiren so far. It&#039;s simplistic, yet kinda stupid, both story and characters are often enough to make me smile. But i&#039;m really far from saying this anime is any good. But as much as Seiren has problems, i can&#039;t name it &quot;the worst thing ever&quot;<br />
<br />
Story &amp; Characters - 2<br />
Seiren doesn&#039;t have absolutly anything good or original in itself. All characters have really strong drawn personalities which we&#039;ve seen in maaany other series. I think the only good point here is perverted protagonist in world of &quot;Ordinary&quot; people. Same

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242479">
        story with story. Seiren has 3 arcs and every one of them tells a story how our protagonist is getting together with each of 3 main heroines. Such type of plot clealry block any posibillities of character development, that&#039;s why our characters stay with the same personality for entire series. As even worse, it heavly brokes immersion, because of which we feel like we couldn&#039;t care less for our heroes.<br />
<br />
Art - 4<br />
Backgrounds look fine, there is not too many detals in them. But characters design really disappoints. All female characters look really similliar, because of which i pretty often had problems with distinction them.<br />
<br />
Sound - 3<br />
Soundtrack is forgettable and sometimes it doesn&#039;t fit with what is happening on the screen. Opening isn&#039;t something amazing, i was skipping them after the first listen, endings don&#039;t sound too appealing either.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 6<br />
Ok, Seiren definitly isn&#039;t a good series, or even medicore. Objectively looking, it&#039;s really bad, something between 2-3. But for unknown reasons... i had fun (or have, the show is still going on). Maybe weren&#039;t these the best moments of my life, but i don&#039;t really regret time spended on this series. Of course, seiren still is a bad anime, but if you can &quot;turn off&quot; your brain for these 20 minutes, you can have some actual fun. It looks like sometimes you need something to just laught off and spend free time on something nonsenical... but yet, there are waaaay better series this season for a good time, like Second Season of Konosuba or Little Witch Academia. You can take Seiren just when you think you saw everything good this season.<br />
<br />
Overall - 4

    Seiren is the spiritual sucessor to the anime/visual novel Amagami. although not having seen Amagami (although i plan to because i like some context with my doujin), the basic of the story is about a guy falling in love with a girl and trying to get into a relationship with them in the span of 4ish episodes with a kiss at the finale,until the show resets and he does it again with a different girl because repercussions aren&#039;t something we want to deal with when watching anime. that&#039;s what it pretty much devolves into, and in this show there are three girls that the main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243418">
        character tries to get with. from these three arc in my opinion only the first arc was entertaining, and while i wanted the next arc to be just as &quot;good&quot; the next two became rather boring, which may be due to how repetitive it quickly becomes and the lackluster endings each arc has.<br />
<br />
 there are several characters in this show, but of course the most important ones are the main cast consisting of the Mc and all three chicks since all the other characters are one-note (not like the main cast ins&#039;t as well). the main protagonist is Shouichi who serves as the self-insert for the viewers since there really isn&#039;t much of a personality for him other than falling in love with the main girls, and reacting to the things happening around him. he&#039;s just bland in order to serve his role. the first girl is Hikari who is one of the most popular girls in the school, as well as a cook and has goals outside of school. despite being a bit of a bitch she is the only one with a personality be it she is a bit rude. the next girl is Tooru who is a girl obsessed with gaming, and a stoic personality who has trouble connecting with other people. although i really wanted to like her she ended up being boring. the final girl is kyouko the obligatory childhood friend who is nice...oh and no one really develops as a characther other than falling in love.<br />
all in all Hikari is best girl and the rest of the cast is bland. 1 Hikari/10.<br />
<br />
 the art looks nice all the girls in the show look visually appealing even the ones who are made to look like shit.the men look decent as well, but i don&#039;t care about them. the background looks decent, but nothing noteworthy, same goes for the lighting and so on. there&#039;s not much to say in terms if animation since there&#039;s not a lot of movement going on especially subtle things like how the characters don&#039;t blink unless they are talking.<br />
<br />
as for sound, eh, nothing not worthy when it comes to the sound track, and the voice actress did a well enough job to sound good.<br />
<br />
overall- the production value is decent enough, and Hikari is best girl<br />
3.33/10 pretty much 1/3 of the show (guess which 1/3)<br />
<br />
also what is with this show and the deers, they are practically the shows mascot and plot device at times. <br />
<br />
also also i&#039;m waiting for the doujins that may never cum

    So, a romcom, harem based anime has just ended for this 1st part of Winter 2017 season, now it&#039;s pretty obvious that this is a spin-off of Amagami SS, where it involves one guy with a harem allocated in each arc, now even thought both have different studios and producers, for some reason the setting where the same and so as the uniforms, so, here is how I rate this 12 episode anime:<br />
<br />
Storywise: Ok, so let&#039;s get over each arc<br />
<br />
Tsuneki Hikari arc: It was set in some remote place where it&#039;s summer and the guy has decide to attend some kind of &quot;save Our Score&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243607">
        seminar, with Tsuneki who reluctantly tagged along m just as know know if Shouich rant her out about her having a part-time job. Now, that&#039;s is quite cheesy to start her arc, you tagged alone just because you suspected your classmate as the one who rant you out is outta her mind, also the romance she had with with the guy was more like a play thingy and I really find it, too, annoying that the guy should have just broken up with that bitch.<br />
<br />
Toru Miyame arc: This arc is more like a sotacon thing, since it involves a quintessential sempai romance, her&#039;s was complicated kind of romance , co&#039;z of the fact that she&#039;s has something against who seemly doesn&#039;t share her gaming addiction. Her plot arc, wasn&#039;t something that can be understood , due to all kinds of hairy compromises, reason and other things that one such as me , would wanna just go in there and hit someone with a paper fan on the head, now let&#039;s face it, the complications were simply added just to keep up with her 4 part arc.<br />
<br />
Kyouko Touno arc: Here we have the quintessential kohai thing, here is an arc that one can relate, since there is a struggle of being a childhood friend to being romantically involve with the guy, now, this for me was this anime&#039;s redeeming factor so, for her arc, I&#039;m gonna gun for a &quot;Good&quot; 7.<br />
<br />
Art: well, artwise it was a bit different from Amagami SS, since both doesn&#039;t feature any panchira thingy around here, I&#039;m gonna give it a &quot;Good&quot; 7 since it was decent in a way, but the score was for Tsuneki&#039;s sexy summer out fit and since she is the only one who was in a bikini in her arc.<br />
<br />
Sound: I&#039;m just gonna give it a &quot;Fair&quot; 6 since I have no comment as to who did whose voices here, but I kinda like the opening theme, but not much.<br />
<br />
Characters: Since I did mentioned that this is a spin off of Amagami SS, now, the characters maybe different, but, the personalities of the characters here are still the same, in Amagami SS there is one guy to six girls ratio, here it&#039;s just one guy to three girls ration, however, here, the girls themselves were a combination of other personalities of the characters from Amagami SS like :<br />
<br />
Tsuneki Hikari: her personality is a combination of that of Ayatsuji Tsukasa&#039;s sadistic and ambitious trait with that of Morishima Haruka&#039;s flirtatious and playful trait.<br />
<br />
Miyame Touro: Hers is that of Nanasaki Ai&#039;s aloofness and stoic personality combine that with Tanamach Kauro&#039;s independent mindedness.<br />
<br />
Touno Kyouko: She has Sakurai Ryouko&#039;s flare for anything that is edible and artistic side, she also has Nakata Sae&#039;s naive and insecurity side. and just like  Ryouko she too is classmates  with the guy&#039;s sister and she also has two club sempai&#039;s who also has the same characteristic but different names, like Koharu Uno who replaces Ruriko Yuzuki from Amagami SS and Nao Tokioka who also has the same wired personalty of that of Hiba Manaka who is also from Amagami SS.<br />
<br />
Also let&#039;s not forget Kamita Shouichi who is basically the same as Tachibana Junichi, both in role and personalty, so from here is is really a &quot;Mediocre&quot; 5.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Well, I basically have some reservations t the first two arc, but then again having the 3rd arc is good , but not very good, just a &quot;Good&quot; 7.<br />
<br />
Overall: it&#039;s &quot;Good&quot; 7, it&#039;s decent, but the first two arc were just too complicated and annoying, it was just the 3rd arc that has made a difference with this anime, yes it was good enough, but not good enough to for studios Gokumi and  AXsiZ , to make additions like a pic drama or any OVA&#039;s for that matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Whoahoho OUT!   <br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    In a season filled to the brim with great animes. Seiren was not one in the category of perfection or masterpiece rank. This was not expected due to the anime being created by the same people who worked on Amagami SS. Seiren follows the same way of developing a story quite like amagami SS with the only diference that it follows for 3 main girls &amp; only went on for 12 episodes. <br />
[Story]6/10<br />
The story elements in seiren follow how the main character Shouichi Kamita interacts with the 3 main heroine. The anime is divided in 3 arcs one for each heroine which are Tsuneki Hikari(eps

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243738">
        1-4), Miyamae Tooru(eps 5-8) and Touno Kyouko(eps 9-12). Each arc has its way of telling this story, but honestly the best arc by far was kyouko&#039;s arc since it had the best story &amp; it actually felt different in relation to the other arcs. Not that the other ones are bad but they feel repetitive.<br />
[Art]8/10<br />
The anime&#039;s art style was really good ironically art wise each heroine looked different &amp; felt different. The atmosphere &amp; town looked great there was great attention to detail in art. The studio did a great job to ilustrate this anime.<br />
[Sound]9/10<br />
Sound wise this anime had great attention to background &amp; atmosphere the noise of animals, in between day &amp; night was great. Also this anime had a great op &amp; also great endings themes for each heroine.<br />
[Character]8/10<br />
The character development in this show was amazing truly one of the good things it has going for it. Each character personally felt different in comparrisson to their story lacking counter part. Also the whole heroine cast has great synergy with the main protagonist. <br />
[Enjoyment]7/10<br />
This anime offers pretty good enjoyment although it feels that the plot doesn&#039;t move forward or at really slow pace which takes away from the full enjoyment of the series. Otherwise it could have been one of the most enjoyable anime of the season. <br />
[Overall]7/10<br />
The anime was good with all the flaws it had they manage to leverage in some other aspects like the character development made up for the lacking story elements. Seiren is not a must watch, but a should I watch hardcore fans of romace anime are going to find good in seiren lets hope for a great second season cause we know there is a whole cast of other heroines to cover.<br />

    So when LA heard the same author of Amagami SS was going to make an original anime under a similar format, LA was first excited!, then immediately remembered the failure in the form of Photo Kano but LA was still excited nonetheless.<br />
<br />
LA will be tackling the plot by each of the girl&#039;s arcs (4 episodes each) in an omnibus format just how Seiren itself does it, so without further ado...<br />
<br />
Hikari Tsuneki&#039;s arc is if anything is our introductory arc, showing us the characters, settings etc, as well as showing us the central girl for this arc Hikari herself. Hikari as as character if LA would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243440">
        say in Amagami SS terms, she&#039;s essentially what happens if Haruka and Tsukasa mashed together. She&#039;s a rather soft yet brash tsundere who loves teasing our main protagonist and her voiced by Ayane Sakura in her tsundere vocals is typical that this character can come off rather *ahem* bitchy...LA however kinda found her character endearing, if anything her carrying her arc (instead of the main protagonist). The chemistry between Hikari and the main protagonist feels artificial to say the least usually because of the all the coincidences and forced teasing she does to him. Her arc later gets rather serious but again, Hikari solves it herself, making the romance even more forced to say the least. Hikari as a character gets more screentime even away from her own arc (quite clearly showing us the author&#039;s favourite in the process) and sure we get more development as it were from her but she is typically her tsundere self and not opening up as much (heck she didn&#039;t even open up even in her own arc!...unless you count the aftermath of the drama that occurred in her arc). Hikari is LA&#039;s favourite character in the series (tsundere are kinda thing for LA.......shut up!) but she had probably the worst arc in the anime and her arc just didn&#039;t do justice for Hikari at all...LA was expecting a Haruka &amp; Tsukasa a la great romance...instead LA got a forced romance with a main protagonist who&#039;s out of his league and coincidences leading to a fated romance. <br />
<br />
Tooru Miyamae&#039;s arc for LA is the literal middle ground for Seiren as an anime for LA, both being rather quirky in it&#039;s own weird way and showing it&#039;s weaknesses at the same time. Tooru Miyamae voiced by Shino Shimoji and her as a character is pretty fleshed out, being an open-minded gamer girl who thinks just a bit too much about games, she can be said to be a wish-fulfillment girl in a ways but she&#039;s packed with her own drama with her games in general. Mainly because she hangs out with guys for the games and has a competitive streak towards it is where her drama comes from and that is actually well done. The quirkiness of her arc comes from the gaming terminology, the fanservice from Tooru and the cameo of Hikari and it&#039;s expected what all this entails. LA didn&#039;t mind the quirkiness as much as Tooru really was the central girl of her own arc and had a bit of playful relationship with our main protagonist but for LA, not to the point of it being legitimate romance, more like a friendship romance at best, because of that in Amagami SS terms, she&#039;s the merged persona of Ai and Kaoru, Ai for her hobby taking the forefront (just change swimming as the drama to gaming) and Kaoru for her personality and status towards the main protagonist. Her arc had her faults just like Hikari all through the romance we all wanted to see as legitimate, but a playfully quirky relationship is a good consolation nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Finally we have the childhood best friend of our main protagonist, Kyouko Touno voiced by Juri Kimura and seriously, story and romantically-wise, this might the best arc. LA will say this arc in &quot;Amagami SS terms&quot; is what happens if Rihoko&#039;s first season arc ACTUALLY had a happy ending!, this arc also had shades of Sae as well all due to Kyouko being a rather shy character (but not as shy as Sae), but the Rihoko similarities are fierce in this one, from being childhood friends, Kyouko and Rihoko being part of the home ec. club (along with some familiar faces?). Seriously though, LA just felt this romance between Kyouko and the main protagonist one of the more legitimate ones in the series, this is mainly because, the main protagonist isn&#039;t shooting out of his own league for one, instead we are going for the childhood friend, an anime trope that is rarely done and what with the main protagonist prior backstory with Kyouko along with some legitimately quirky fanservice (this being our previous 2 heroines gets the grunt of it though Kyouko DOES get some, it IS her arc) yet great bonding moments, it&#039;s romance is decent at best, sure drama occurs, but the drama doesn&#039;t push the romance away like Hikari and Tooru&#039;s ones did, instead it&#039;s based on the main protagonist having legitimate feelings for Kyouko, thus doesn&#039;t feel fake or artificial, not to mention HOW his endevour was execute was natural especially coming from BOTH Kyouko as well as or main protagonist .<br />
<br />
Well LA talked lots about our main girls of the series, but not the man protagonist himself...well the main protagonist Shouichi Kamita is well, an otaku of many things (gaming and magical girl genre...don&#039;t ask), is typically perverted albeit conservative about it and is generally your nice guy who wants to help. He is generally the weakness link the arcs (besides Kyouko) mainly in the romance department which is kinda crucial in a romance anime, but what with the anime&#039;s omnibus format to suit the needs of the girl in question, it&#039;s kinda expected that his personality is bland, but the one thing LA will not forgive to Shouichi is the fact that he creates the romance to be artificially fake (Hikari&#039;s and shades of Tooru&#039;s did that). Even Amagami SS&#039; main protagonist Junichi had some shades of legitimate romance here and there that weren&#039;t forced in most of his arcs which only emphasized the girl in question&#039;s arc to develop BOTH of their characters and romances together. Seiren&#039;s main protagonist makes the romance forced and fake for 2/3&#039;s of his arcs and no it&#039;s not because of the fanservice or the anime&#039;s quirky way of doing things...it&#039;s Shouichi as a character and how his coincidences or his bland personality (or his interests to be honest) that leads to his romances, he doesn&#039;t pursue his romance, he&#039;s just the nice guy helping out the girl in question. Romance is later. Shouichi is the biggest problem of this anime especially in the romance department and having a blank slate in which the male audience can relate to just isn&#039;t enough if our main protagonist isn&#039;t ACTIVE or have the sense of urgency in his pursuit of romance and his romances either comes last after the drama or coincidences allows him to pursue his romance. Ok enough ranting...<br />
<br />
The minor cast consists of recurring characters like Miu Hiyama voiced by Shiori Izawa, Tomoe Kamita, Shouchi&#039;s OLDER sister voiced by Manami Numakura, Ikuo Nanasaki voiced by Ryota Asari (hmmm names familiar), Shouichi&#039;s friend and Ruise Sanjou voiced by Honoka Kuroki, the student council president along with satellite character and much more and yes...it&#039;s expected that this kind of minor cast are nothing but support with the remaining heroines getting nothing more than cameos until their arc arrives (this includes Tooru and Kyouko in some respects).<br />
<br />
LA talked alot about comparing Amagami SS to Seiren, well with good reason is that one, Seiren&#039;s timeline is 9 years after Amagami SS once again set in the same school as Amagami SS, Ikuo Nanasaki is Ai&#039;s younger brother who&#039;s much more different and finally the Miss Santa Contest is a blatant one. Ohhh and with this, Seiren also has an affinity towards it&#039;s own as the arcs progress thus giving Seiren it&#039;s own quirky personality in the name of fanservice most of the time, it&#039;s themes namely being an obsession with deer products (games, the actual animal, meat of it etc...also don&#039;t ask.), the aforementioned Miss Santa contest and the Crimson Mask super sentai show.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation by Studio Gokumi and AXsiZ, the animation for the most part from the backgrounding to the character designs are pretty well done as well as many of the minor to main cast to be striking with some exotic character design, with the exception being Shouichi with good reason, bland main male protagonist...-sigh- typical. The animation on the background does look gorgeous at times and LA will praise Studio Gokumi and AXsiZ in their level of detail across the board, this especially important in the anime&#039;s more romantic scenes where Christmas is kinda a central event and the Winter scenes are gorgeous if anything. Overall, decent job from Studio Gokumi and AXsiZ with some rather decently exotic yet somewhat bland character designs.<br />
<br />
In terms of voice acting, the voice acting is acceptable across the board, with no squeakers let alone any annoying vocals here and there. LA quite enjoyed Ayane Sakura as Hikari and the rare times she was there, Yukari Tamura as Shouichi&#039;s teacher Masami Onigata. But again, like its animation, the voice cast is decent but not much to praise about...well besides Ayane Sakura and Juri Kimura but nonetheless, the voice cast is decent.<br />
<br />
If LA could put Seiren as an analogy with the rest of Amagami SS and Photo Kano, then LA would say that Amagami SS is like the brilliant older sister who does have her faults but knows what she needs to do and does it well, Seiren is like the second sister and middle child of the bunch where she&#039;s pretty shy and awkward most of the time, but just give her a bit of time and she&#039;ll open up to you and she looks up to her oldest sister *cough* homages *cough*....Photo Kano is like the naive youngest sister of the sisters who just doesn&#039;t know what the hell she&#039;s doing, being too focused on one thing and too little on many others...<br />
<br />
Well, Seiren is technically only halfway done, what with another season covering the later three girls of Miu Hiyama, Makoto Kamizaki and Ruise Sanjou with LA being intrigued by Miu&#039;s character in particular what with her constant cameos...let&#039;s just hope Seiren will get better in the romance department (LA is looking at you Shouichi), otherwise..LA&#039;s analogy about Seiren, Amagami SS and Photo Kano WILL be accurate.

    I&#039;m just going to say it outright; if anyone is going to remember this anime at all, it will be as Amagami SS&#039;s eccentric little sister. The &quot;eccentric&quot; part comes from the fact that the story presents some rather bizarre events and quotes, while the &quot;little sister&quot; part comes from not only the fact that it not only noticeably comes from the same universe, but a couple of the characters are actually younger siblings of Amagami SS characters! (Let&#039;s not forget the omnibus format both series share, too.) In fact, this connection with Amagami SS was why I selected this anime to be among those

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244893">
        from the Winter 2017 anime that I watched in the first place; in spite of this decision, however, my expectations were actually quite low. Unfortunately, I was proven right.<br />
<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my review of Amagami SS&#039;s eccentric little sister, &quot;Seiren&quot;.<br />
<br />
Seiren follows the romantic misadventures of Shoichi Kamita, a second-year high school boy. Similarly to Amagami SS, four episodes each cover the heroines that Shoichi ends up romancing, except the number of girls is halved this time. First, we&#039;ve got Hikari Tsuneki, the cheerful &quot;idol&quot; of Shoichi&#039;s class with a secret job at a restaurant. Then, we&#039;ve got Tooru Miyamae, a gamer girl who joins Shoichi and his friends in playing what I&#039;ve come to think of as &quot;a deer version of Pokemon&quot;. Finally, we&#039;ve got Kyouko Tono, Shoichi&#039;s childhood friend who just joined the Home Economics Club. As time goes on in each of the girls&#039; arcs, Shoichi becomes closer with either one of these girls and gradually falls in love with her....whether or not he actually has any chemistry with any of them.<br />
<br />
What could I possibly mean by that last sentence? I mean exactly what I said; Shoichi does not have very strong chemistry with any of these girls. I mean, when you&#039;re creating an anime with this format, it&#039;s hard to build a strong connection between our protagonist with all of the girls he gets with, but there&#039;s bound to be at least one girl who has a believable relationship with him. Unfortuately, in Seiren, there is none of that; in the best case scenario, I would see Shoichi and the girl whose arc is ongoing as just friends, and that&#039;s pretty much it. Each of their stories suffer a bit because of this, too, and when an anime&#039;s story is taken down with two characters&#039; chemistry, especially when it&#039;s done three times in the same series, we&#039;ve got ourselves a bit of a problem. Although the story can surprise you with its bizarre ideas at times (for example, there is a character with a real thing for bunnies), it doesn&#039;t help too much.<br />
<br />
Now, let&#039;s discuss the characters. I remember liking Junichi, the protagonist of Amagami SS, a lot, especially since he had what Shoichi didn&#039;t: a believable personality. Shoichi, on the other hand, is a rather boring main character with little personality; it&#039;s not as easy to root for this guy. The heroines aren&#039;t much help, either. While Hikari is definitely the most interesting of the bunch, it really didn&#039;t feel like she got a lot of development, so I couldn&#039;t get myself to like her. Tooru had potential, but as time went on, she seemed to become less and less of an interesting character; by the end of her arc, I had given up on her. As for Kyouko.... ugh, where do I even begin? Out of all of the heroines - no, out of all of the characters, period - she has to be the character, or at least one of the characters, with the least amount of personality, and I honestly felt that her relationship with Shoichi, as well as her entire arc, was the weakest. Out of the supporting cast, there are a few memorable characters, but most of them are pretty forgettable.<br />
<br />
The animation, done by Studio Gokumi, wasn&#039;t terrible; sometimes, the movement of the characters was a bit awkward, but for the most part, it wasn&#039;t terrible. After all, a particular diamond in the rough from Seiren came from a beautifully-animated scene in episode 4; I won&#039;t say what it is because of spoilers, but anyone who has actually watched this series might know what I&#039;m talking about. The voice acting wasn&#039;t too bad, either; for the most part, the voice actors played their roles well, although some weren&#039;t really as good. The opening and endings themes were also nice to listen to, albeit not songs to listen to over and over again.<br />
<br />
Overall, Seiren was a below-average anime. I won&#039;t stop you if you&#039;re desperate to watch it, but if you&#039;re looking for an anime with an omnibus format where the protagonist ends up with more than one girl in more than one alternate universe, I&#039;d prefer that you watch Amagami SS. I mean, let&#039;s be honest; it&#039;s more memorable than Seiren.

    Nothing about this feels like it should have been an anime. In fact it may have been better as live action considering the animation is minimal, color pallet is drab, and character design pretty generic. I understand not every anime has to be about heroes and destiny, mechs and magic, aliens and demons, time travel and parallel dimensions... BUT they should be a little more interesting than some completely average high school character (with seemingly nothing going on) besides not knowing what to do with his life (so then like every high school character ever). In a show where characters appearing &quot;normal&quot; seems to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247040">
        the unique twist instead of appearing super eccentric, kawaii, or &quot;anime-y&quot;, no one feels particularly relate-able or interesting or funny. Like the forgot to infuse the characters with well... &quot;character&quot;. I found myself bored and un-charmed all the way through desperately waiting for something, anything to happen but it never came. If it sounds like I don&#039;t enjoy slice of life, high school comedy/romance shows you&#039;re dead wrong. Shows like Orange get what this show feels like it wish it could do. Where other high school shows with a twist like Angel Beats I feel does a disservice to the show.
