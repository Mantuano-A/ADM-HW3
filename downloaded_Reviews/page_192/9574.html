    “Dokyuu Hentai HxEros” is nothing apart from an absurd masterpiece. <br />
<br />
One of the most delicate components of anime is using ecchi scenes and visuals. Sometimes, it may not be necessary and fans may as well become dissatisfied by its useless addition to the anime. On the other hand, if echiness is used as a primary drive it also becomes hard to watch (two good examples of anime like this are “To LOVE Ru” and “High School DxD”). However, “Dokyuu Hentai HxEros” is an anime that breaks all extremes as discussed above and it has become one of the funniest anime I’ve ever watched. <br />
<br />
Now, before

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349838">
        I continue, I’m not going to imply that “HxEros” is by any means close to some of the greatest anime out there. However, for the medium of anime that it exists on, this anime is an exquisite taste of art. <br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
One of the funniest parts of this anime is its story. The main reason is because the entire story is ridiculous. Essentially, it’s power rangers on crack. HxHeros use special devices called the HxEros to use their erotic energy to save the planet from Kiseichu: monsters who want to take everyone’s erotic energy (i.e H-energy) to take over the planet and make the human race extinct. Oh, and it’s not over yet, when the HxHeros kill a Kiseichu they have all of their clothes ripped off of them. Everything about this ridiculous plot makes the anime adds to great comedy and actually makes me want to watch more of the anime. Furthermore, the backstories of all the characters are enjoyable and as the story progresses we actually start to see some character development in all of the HxHeros which is great. However, while the story is really “interesting”, it obviously isn’t anything close to a masterpiece.<br />
<br />
Characters: 5/10<br />
Although the story is great, the characters aren’t as good. All of the characters essentially are just some horny teenagers who don’t have really unique personalities. For example, characters who want larger breasts like Momoka are essentially in almost every single anime (for example Sakura from Naruto). Womanly characters like Maihime are pretty common as well (take any older sister or mom from an anime). Retto is your typical MC who wants to “save everyone” (although his reason why is rather funny) and Kirara is your average tsundere character. The only two unique people I saw in this anime Runba and Anno but they’re both supporting characters so they don’t really make much difference to the anime. <br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
To put it quickly, the art may have been too good for an anime like this. Studio Mausu did a really great job on this anime. The visuals are clean and smooth and the character designs are really nice. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
The opening was great! I honestly can’t stop playing it and listening to it. A great opening by Burnout Syndrome. The fact that they even took part in an anime like this makes it even more hilarious! The music also makes the anime sound really legitimate too when the anime is so ridiculous. The OSTs are also fine and the ending is pretty nice and calm too.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
I really enjoyed this anime. Watching Rettos adventures defeating Kiseichu makes me laugh out loud every single time I watch it.  <br />

    Ladies and Gentlemen, I did it! I finally found the single worst anime of 2020. Worse than Rent a Girlfriend. Worse than God of Highschool. Dokyuu Hentai HxEros makes Peter Grill look like a fucking masterpiece! <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not that hentai Hxeros has the worst animation. It doesn&#039;t have the worst dub. It doesn&#039;t even have the worst premise. The actual plot on paper SEEMS like it could have been funny. Some guy clearly came up with this show while slightly drunk at 3 AM in the morning and couldn&#039;t stop giggling. It&#039;s the directing and execution that murders this show and makes it one of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363650">
        the hardest to watch anime I&#039;ve seen in a LONG time.<br />
<br />
The plot of this masterpiece is that an insectoid species of aliens want to take over Earth and replace the humans. Their plan is absorb &quot;erotic energy&quot; and rob men and women of their sex drives. Once the human fertility rate drops below 2.1, humans will eventually go extinct and the aliens can simply replace them. I&#039;m serious. It&#039;s a show about aliens turning women into prudes who refuse to put out and making dudes gay in order to commit a sneaky genocide. The whole premise of this show is that it&#039;s a porn parody of a far right conspiracy forum. Then it mixes this with Power Rangers for...some reason. A scientist must find 5 teenagers with extreme horniness. He then gives them wrist bands that allow them to channel their extreme thirst and transform into super Sentai called &quot;Super Hentai&quot;. Once again, I&#039;m sure this was very funny at 3 AM in the morning. <br />
<br />
So what kind of jokes do we get? In the first episode, one of the aliens randomly transforms into the Devil Gundam from the end of G Gundam, forcing the main characters to get naked and use the special move from the ending of that 1994 anime. Let&#039;s pretend the audience has never seen G Gundam, which most people haven&#039;t. The joke doesn&#039;t work because it&#039;s just a random reference to an old anime. Let&#039;s assume the viewer is a boomer like me who happens to LOVE G-Gundam. Even I didn&#039;t laugh because they didn&#039;t set up or commit to the joke. They didn&#039;t change the animation style or use the music from G Gundam or rabidly scream the lines like the voice actors from G-Gundam. The scene just randomly comes out of nowhere and ends in 3 seconds with the 2 main characters striking the iconic pose and that&#039;s it. The joke is just &quot;haha G-Gundam exists&quot;. This is &quot;Epic Movie&quot; level comedy!<br />
<br />
That was just one example, but this anime NEVER lands a joke. It just thinks that having a silly premise on paper and making references to other franchises is good enough to bring in the laughs. That is the lowest caliber of spoof! I never thought I&#039;d watch an anime that makes me think Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer wrote it!<br />
<br />
Compare this to Peter Grill. That&#039;s an anime about a knight errant whose name is a blatant parody of Peter Quill from Guardians of the Galaxy. The whole joke is that he&#039;s supposed to be a noble and faithful knight to his princess, but he is easily seduced by dozens of monster girls and feels extreme guilt that he&#039;s made the princess the biggest cuckquean in the land. It&#039;s a stupid premise with only ONE joke, but they really commit to that joke! It actually got a few laughs out of me. The comedy lies in the fact that you know the punchline (Peter being unable to keep it in his pants), is coming, but you don&#039;t know exactly how or when it&#039;s going to happen. The best part of this type of humor is that when done well, it actually becomes funnier the more times it happens. It eventually reaches a peak, but Peter Grill is extremely short and never lets it reach that point of exhaustion. Don&#039;t get me wrong, Peter Grill is still a terrible anime! I mean unapologetically bad. It&#039;s just miles better than Hentai Hxeros. <br />
<br />
So if Hentai Hxeros isn&#039;t funny, it&#039;s at least sexy right? NOPE! The character designs are pretty lame, the boobs are massive but poorly drawn, and it&#039;s heavily censored. Even in the racier DVD version, it&#039;s still heavily censored. Just not to the absurd level of the TV anime where you simply can&#039;t see anything on the entire screen. Even if they one day released an uncensored version, it still wouldn&#039;t be remotely hot! <br />
<br />
If Peter Grill is a shitty bootleg of Interspecies Reviewers, Hentai Hxeros is a ten cent VHS tape someone dug out of the dumpster behind an old Blockbuster. It is the Video Brinquedo of ecchi. It is the Golden Films or Bevanfield of erotic anime comedy. Only wish this on your worst enemies. <br />

    What Can I say besides WHY ARE YOU CENSORING THE LINGERINE?!<br />
<br />
So starting off I&#039;m after episode 3 and main things I would like to point out are:<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
- Art really fits ecchi style of the anime<br />
- The idea of the story is interesting (but made poorly)<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- Style of censorship (many examples on how not to use censorship in anime)<br />
- Censoring panties and bra if they are being worn on someone? Really?<br />
- Dreadfull characters<br />
- Enemies are statues. During the fight they are standing in place and not moving at all even while being under attack. (its not a time to do a stand, you dont have your

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349811">
        spiritual guard to fight for you)<br />
- Many irrational decisions. If they are heroes then the world is ruined<br />
<br />
I heard someone comparing it (before airing time) to Ishuzoku Reviewers. Like bro, If IR is the sun that shines the Ecchi genre then this is the rock which is 3 meters under the sea ground. No comparison.<br />
<br />
Overall 3 or 4 out of 10 and would not fap to.<br />
Cheers, and have a nice day

    The Power Rangers is a kids show where multiple colorful individuals gang up on some evil alien. Every episode a new alien would appear, and the heroes would defeat him. Now, what if you took this formulaic premise and crank the horniness up to max? Well, you get this shit.<br />
<br />
Dokyuu Hentai HxEros’s narrative is pretty much what you get when you spam boobies and horny teenagers into a script. The story follows the Hentai Sentai gang as they fight to protect the world from evil aliens known as The Kiseichu, who try to take over the Earth by stealing their desire to bone each other.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357426">
        When it comes to horniness everybody and their mom knows that teenagers are unmatched in that category,and in comes highschooler named Enjo Retto, but is really horny Natsu, as he and his group of equally horny teenage friends beat up random kiseichuu they find on the street.<br />
<br />
The art is colorful if not a bit stiff at times. The palette really matches a show and makes every character pop out and seem unique even if they’re personalities aren’t.The aesthetics is way better then it should be. Good on you Studio Mausu<br />
<br />
The sound is done fairly well for a show of this nature.All the osts were nice yet a bit forgettable, but both the opening and ending song of this show are extremely catchy and sounds it could be a song for a Power Rangers show, which really adds to the whole “Sunday cartoon” feel of the show. <br />
 <br />
The cast of this show can be summed up as Horny Natsu, boobs,boobs,boobs ,boobs, and a furry. Each character fills their archetype but don’t do much else. The only character arc in this entire show is with Kiara, Enjo’s obligatory tsundere childhood friend who wonders why a pinky promise she made in elementary school doesn’t equal instant sex. Besides that basic character arc there is nothing here besides shallow tropes we’ve seen done a million times. <br />
<br />
Overall, HXEros is a show that knows its audience and knows what they want.If you’re looking for a deep tale with compelling themes and characters that you can relate to and learn from, you won’t find any here.  HxEros is just a simple and fun ecchi fest that you can turn your brain off and enjoy. It doesn’t have grand narrative but sometimes that’s not what you need, sometimes you just want an easy-to-digest boobies show, and that’s perfectly fine.<br />

    Let me ask you a question. While watching a trashy harem show, do you ever think, &quot;Man, this is absolutely garbage, but I still fucking love it!&quot;? Wait, you actually do? Then Dokyuu Hentai HxEros is a show especially made for you.<br />
<br />
If the &quot;Hentai&quot; part of the title didn&#039;t make it obvious, Dokyuu Hentai HxEros is your typical trashy harem anime which is filled with an absurd amount of fanservice and has a plot that&#039;s more questionable than that of a lot of hentai. And no, I&#039;m not exaggerating a single thing. Pretty much everything about HxEros is unbelievably ridiculous, but I just can&#039;t seem

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357586">
        to bring myself to hate it.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Story]<br />
<br />
An unknown type of alien called &quot;Censor Bug&quot;, unbeknownst to most humans, invades Earth and starts plundering their erotic energy in an attempt to make them extinct. As a part of the Saitama branch of HxEros, a group of teenagers &quot;gifted with a special ability&quot;, our protagonist Retto Enjou, his childhood friend Kirara Hoshino, and 3 other highschool girls fight against the censor bugs in order to rescue mankind from their hands.<br />
<br />
So, what is this &quot;special ability&quot; exactly?<br />
<br />
The &quot;special ability&quot; that HxEros possess is their extraordinary eroticism, that they use to destroy the censor bugs (somehow their own clothing as well) by converting it to &quot;H-energy&quot; using certain devices.<br />
<br />
Dokyuu Hentai HxEros follows the members of HxEros&#039; Saitama branch as they use their &quot;H-energy&quot; to stop the censor bugs from stealing mankind&#039;s &quot;H-energy&quot;.<br />
<br />
It sounds extremely ridiculous, doesn&#039;t it?<br />
<br />
Yes, the plot of Dokyuu Hentai HxEros certainly sounds ridiculous, and IS ridiculous. As I said before, most hentai have less questionable plots than this show. However, I don&#039;t think that it&#039;s entirely meritless. As weird and ludicrous as it may seem, I think that the plot of the show is actually somewhat &quot;unique&quot; and &quot;creative&quot;. No matter how absurd it ultimately turns out to be, it actually tries to be innovative with its plot, which deserves some praise in my opinion. Some of the situations that our &quot;HxEros&quot; fall into are actually funny, let it be intentional or unintentional. I know there are a few plot holes as well (like, why is everyone depending on a bunch of horny teenagers and not taking any actions themselves?), but who cares about that?<br />
<br />
<br />
[Animation]<br />
<br />
HxEro&#039;s artstyle is pretty decent. The character designs look aesthetic. However, when we come to the actual visuals, there are some big issues....<br />
<br />
First of all, I don&#039;t know why Project No. 9 thought it was a great idea to make the censors so large that one censor covers almost half of the screen, but it certainly isn&#039;t very pleasant to my eyes. Rather, these huge and unnecessary censors became really annoying very quickly, for more than one reason. The second major issue with the animation is that it becomes very inconsistent at times. It&#039;s decent for the first few episodes of the show, but it noticeably becomes a lot duller in the later episodes and starts degrading bit by bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Sound]<br />
<br />
The soundtrack of HxEros is fairly mediocre. Almost all the background tracks are forgettable. The opening song sung by BURNOUT SYNDROMES (that&#039;s how they write their name) is kinda funny for how ridiculous it is, and although many people weren&#039;t a big fan of the ending song, I don&#039;t think that it&#039;s bad. Overall, the soundtrack is average at best.<br />
<br />
The voice acting, on the other hand, is actually amazing. I was very surprised to see such high quality voice acting in an anime of this caliber. Almost all the voice actors did a great job at voicing their respective characters. Suffice to say, the voice acting is easily the best aspect of the show.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Character]<br />
<br />
If I had to sum up the characters of Dokyuu Hentai HxEros in just one sentence, it would be this: They are all as dull as dishwater. Almost every character can be described by using a certain stereotype. Retto is your typical dense harem protagonist who continuously falls into perverted situation with several girls, and Kirara is your typical tsundere heroine who loves the protagonist but somehow hasn&#039;t become aware of her feelings yet. The same applies to other characters as well.<br />
<br />
Despite being extremely generic, however, they aren&#039;t really unlikeable. Especially Retto and Kirara are loveable and look very adorable together. Although their backstory is questionable to say the least, their interactions are pretty heartwarming. And unlike most other harem protagonists, Retto is actually aware of her feelings towards Kirara and determined to ask her out when the time comes, which is a bit refreshing to me.<br />
<br />
I definitely won&#039;t give the characters a high rating, though. While it&#039;s true that they are likeable, most of them don&#039;t receive any proper development throughout the entire series. Besides Retto and Kirara, nobody is given proper focus (unless you count their so poorly present backstories). Especially the side characters suffer the most from this problem. I would have liked to learn more about Tokyo branch members and some of the other characters since they appear only for a short amount of time. Giving them more screen time would have made the show more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Enjoyment]<br />
<br />
As absurd and brainless as Dokyuu Hentai HxEros is, I kinda enjoyed it to be honest. It managed to keep me somewhat entertained for almost the entirety of its runtime even with many, many glaring issues and absolute ridiculousness. Well, that probably only shows how garbage my taste is.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Overall]<br />
<br />
So, would I recommend watching Dokyuu Hentai HxEros to anyone?<br />
<br />
The answer is absolutely a no. Everything about the anime, excluding the voice acting, is extremely ridiculous and not so well-made. There are times when the show can become straight-up nonsensical and even cringe-inducing. So, if you are looking for a show with a compelling plot and remarkable characters, you should, without any kind of doubt, avoid Dokyuu Hentai HxEros. However, if you are someone like me who occasionally enjoys watching trashy ecchi and harem shows for no reason whatsoever, this might be something you would enjoy watching. I didn&#039;t find the show as &quot;good&quot; as To LOVE-Ru Darkness (I apologize for the random comparison) for a number of reasons, but I found it pretty entertaining nonetheless.

    &quot;Protect your love to the very end, no matter from which Hero WOAH OH!<br />
H×EROS...Wake Up HERO!&quot;<br />
<br />
This is the opening verse for this show&#039;s OP by the talented BURNOUT SYNDROMES (just called HXEROS SYNDROMES feat. Kirito&#039;s VA just because), and I&#039;d guess for anyone who has watched Dokyuu Hentai HxEros, this is the epitome of Power Rangers / Super Sentai that&#039;s full-on ecchi crack to the max. AND I LOVE IT, silliness and all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone once said, Hero is written with the words H and Ero.&quot;<br />
<br />
With the power of donned accessories and a hero suit to match, danger is no match for the HxEros team of one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357418">
        conceited simp and 4 girls to match against their enemy: the Kiseichuu (or censor bugs) who are on constant stealing of ordinary humans&#039; H-energy to rob them of their soul. So who are the Super Sentai crew of chosen humans to fend Earth from the Kiseichuu? Well, you&#039;ve come to the right place.<br />
<br />
The number 5, which is the standard number of members in EVERY iteration of the Power Rangers / Super Sentai is great on its own, and HxEros is no different. Their names are: the simp-but-not-so-simp Enjou Retto, the childhood friend of the simp Hoshino Kirara, the busty Shirayuki Maihime, the flat Momozono Momoka and the childlike Sora Tenkuuji. All the girls obviously have different powers to match, but it&#039;s through the &quot;sexual tensions&quot; of Retto that enable them to defeat the censor bugs, no matter how small nor big the creature can go.<br />
<br />
Particularly, clue in between Enjou Retto and Hoshino Kirara, because they get the most screentime due to their childhood circumstances that made them into the HxEros figure that they&#039;re best known for. Y&#039;all see, Kirara had a disorder that essentially turned her into an ice princess, but the reason why is of the past between young Retto and Kirara, where one censor bug tolled away Kirara&#039;s emotions of love, and Retto could do nothing about it to defend his first love against the whims of the censor bug. And that sparked his resolution within him to eradicate all censor bugs  by joining the HxEros defense force, and with the wristwatch accessory to band together similar users&#039; erotic energy, protect ordinary citizens H-energy, which is the source of love.<br />
<br />
So, an essentially ecchi-fied Super Sentai, that&#039;s all fine by me. What is the elephant in the room is with the overly cliché characters that unfortunately each don&#039;t have unique identities that they can stand out with (well, except their body figures), and not just the Saitama Branch of Retto&#039;s alone, but other girls from other branches (Tokyo Branch with Moena Wakamusa and Shiko Murasame) as well, to which by that very point, I don&#039;t really care who&#039;s who, so as long as Retto keeps having heavily-censored fanservice, at least that&#039;s a point to fap with. Oh wait, I&#039;ve missed out the Kiseichuu-abandoned shape-shifting queen Chacha, and the very ecchi dog Runba? Nah, gender bending at its best. But one thing&#039;s for sure...the harem KEEPS GROWING.<br />
<br />
Speaking of heavy censoring, it&#039;s a shame that Project No. 9&#039;s chief director Masato Jinbo chooses to adapt works that are trash and don&#039;t really carve out its unique stand-out identities. There&#039;s one common thing though: overly generic, tried-and-true stories that we&#039;ve seen one too many over the vast distance of anime over the years which have overall better execution. Coupled together with the very stiff animation and viscously lacking art that is underwhelming (when compared to the full-on nudity of the manga), the fact that borderline-hentai ecchi series are being heavily censored is always a NO-NO, even if it&#039;s a marketing gimmick to sell more Blu-Ray DVDs in order to release an uncensored version of the show, as an accomplishment of sorts.<br />
<br />
And going back to the sound, at first when I&#039;ve heard that BURNOUT SYNDROMES was gonna do a song for this show, I immediately hated it with a flaming passion. I mean come on, is this the same band that gave us one of their best songs (which is Dr. Stone&#039;s &quot;Good Morning World!&quot;)? But overtime, I&#039;ve learned to accept that nothing is perfect, and this OP is passable at best. While I can like the OP, the ED is the one that I don&#039;t like, simply put: a poorly composed song that doesn&#039;t sound good either.<br />
<br />
Overall, to put in perspective of similar shows done before with varying degrees of success (Masou Gakuen HxH, Val X Love), this show can join those in the same pack of mindless ecchi battle action that doesn&#039;t make sense the more the plot takes shape. I do love shitty shows that at least have some potential within them, but for HxEros? There&#039;s none to be had here, sad to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Again and Again, stand up HEROES!&quot; NO MORE.

    HxEros adaptation is a failure.<br />
<br />
They didn&#039;t properly convey the message of the anime.<br />
They charge H-energy to beat enemy (censor bugs) and yet they never done anything that was actually perverted. But instead you get cliché stuff that most <br />
anime have done better.<br />
<br />
Our so called &quot;heroes&quot; are fighting censor bug to bring back stolen libido. But the anime is doing the opposite.<br />
You got ridiculously excessive censorship:<br />
-star censorship (which is fine for blu ray release)<br />
-fragment broken clothing<br />
-too much steam<br />
-lights on lingerie (seriously?)<br />
-view point censoring<br />
-random dark lights and more.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation<br />
This anime version has a lot of image cropping from the original art.<br />
Art in anime was fine. But original had

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350374">
        more details. There are missing erotic parts as well and the view point in anime was made for censoring which I labeled above.<br />
Animation was fine at first and started to get dull further.<br />
<br />
Music<br />
Sound was blended right and the Opening is a banger I like it.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
Every heroine has a different type of character which is known in most anime already. While male character wasn&#039;t bad or good either I&#039;d say average at most.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
I tried to enjoy the show as much possible as I want but instead I feel like I was betrayed. It feels bad receiving this kind treatment the studio made for the adaptation.<br />
<br />
I recommend you to read the original and compare it. To get a better understanding.

    A Wild Censor Bug Has Appeared!<br />
Fwish! Fwish!<br />
Swooo~sh<br />
Oh no! It has taken the sexual desire of some human beings! What will our main character do!?<br />
POW!!!<br />
And with that one punch, ladies and gentleman, the censor bug is gone and our hero is now naked in the middle of town.<br />
---<br />
The story won&#039;t get any different from my little synopsis right up there. How could it? Based on the character list alone, Enjou Retto, one of the protagonists, has quite a harem. Revealed in the first episode, Retto has a complicated history with his first love, Hoshino Kirara. Because of incidents in the past involving censor bugs, Kirara avoids

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349739">
        boys. And Retto, her childhood friend, is not an exception.<br />
<br />
Anyone that has a somewhat lewd brain could probably come up with the story line. The animation has its inconsistencies, but all in all, the ecchi in this anime is fairly emphasized. But let me just tell you, for those who want to know, that the animation is censored, unlike the manga. (Don&#039;t worry though, there will be an uncensored version)<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t say much about the sound quality, but the characters have tropes they follow. Right off the bat, we can tell that Kirara has a tsundere-ish side, and Retto is your average harem protagonist. There&#039;s nothing too eye-catching that I would like to say, but if you&#039;re planning to watch a blooming romance where all the characters get naked on the streets because of their erotic energy, then this is the anime for you.

    If you are still traumatized after watching Terra Formars, worry no longer! Dokyuu Hentai HxEros is a masterpiece that humanity has been waiting for so long. <br />
<br />
Someone once said, hero is written with the words H and Ero, which pretty much gives you an idea of what this anime is going to be about. Enjou Retto is a superhero, who fights against the troublesome bugs that are trying to strip the humanity of their lust, as well as because of the fact that his first love suffered an attack of the aliens and she no longer loves him. Unforgivable! He now, with the power of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357416">
        HxEros, which is a wristwatch-like device that gives its owner the power in exchange for the user’s erotic power, tries to settle a score with the invaders. Guess how this device is recharged? You guessed it right. The user’s h-energy recharges the mechanism.  Five heroes are ready to save all with H and Ero. Their names are: Shirayuki Maihime, Enjou Retto, Hoshino Kirara, Momozono Momoka and Tenkuuji Sora.<br />
<br />
The moment Edward Neumeier saw the first episode of Dokyuu Hentai HxEros, he could not believe that his Star Troopers lacked something very simple, yet, important. And that is the insects that are hungry for the erotic power of the humanity. It might sound stupid, but think for a moment, this idea is brilliant. The aliens strip the humanity of love, making everyone asexual. As a result, declining birth rates and a possible scenario that humans will just cease to exist. This does, indeed, sound improbable, but this idea deserves respect simply because of the fact that it is ‘unique.’ <br />
<br />
Character wise, however, there are many issues for me to touch upon. The main point for me to make is that while the storyline does try to be unique, the anime’s characters simply suffer all the possible cliché, one can think of. Of course, never ending cliché is not that much of a problem, the problem is that the characters are just beyond boring. Even these ‘dog scenes,’ which were obviously plagiarized from Gantz, show that Dokyuu Hentai HxEros had a hard time trying to make something out of its characters. <br />
<br />
All in all, this is what you have. A somewhat unique storyline, which is far from being perfect, and the characters that are just beyond average. Will I recommend you Dokyuu Hentai HxEros? I will not, unless you are a fan of the genre and want to see ‘a somewhat unique ecchi’ that tries to be good, however, in the end, fails to be one. With that being said, simply because of the fact that it tried to be good, I will give it some extra points.

    I almost forget how absurd this show is, I was busy laughing because of this reason. Is it trying to be a comedy story to justify the laughs? No, this anime is trying to be serious, that&#039;s why I&#039;m laughing.<br />
In a world where weird-looking creatures &quot;attack&quot; humans to become stronger by &quot;eating&quot; their sexual energy, Retto Enjou decides to become a hero by using a device that uses &quot;erotic power&quot; to protect the people. The reason behind his will is nothing but the girl he loves, his childhood friend Kirara Hoshino, once a pervert kid that used to hang out with Retto untill a monster/insect/something

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349736">
        weird ate her erotic energy in front of Retto. Since that moment, she became an annoying tsundere that can&#039;t stand being touched by the opposite gender or anything touched by it.<br />
Sounds interesting, right?<br />
<br />
Story: 2<br />
Absurd, mediocre and with contradictions.<br />
First of all, characters becoming stronger with &quot;erotic power&quot; is nothing original at all, it&#039;s something that has been used in many stories already. Leaving aside the unoriginal plot, the enemies of this story are monsters with the shape of insects with own personalities (very mediocre personalities tbh) that will eat your erotic power by just standing near you, but they won&#039;t if you are a hero or you are a person near a hero. Why? Well, plot armor guys, we need to make it interesting.<br />
The story has some important contradictions for the sake of the plot. If a monster takes someone&#039;s erotic power, this person will become a cold and embittered person, no sexual desire left. But for the sake of our MC and his girl, Kirara feels horny when she touches him, something that can&#039;t happen according to the story but is a exception between these two. Why? Plot...I mean, Kirara is such a pervert that even if the monster ate her erotic power, she still can produce a gigantic quantity of it because she wants to play &quot;mom and dad&quot; with Retto. Yes, at that time she was an elementary school girl horny af for Retto. Btw, the monster that took Kirara&#039;s erotic power blows up all of a sudden after it.<br />
I don&#039;t have problems with ecchi fan service if it&#039;s only for the sake of good comedy, not the case here. There&#039;s not much fan service anyways, but when it does, it&#039;s mediocre af.<br />
<br />
Characters: 3<br />
- Kirara: I don&#039;t usually dislike tsunderes, unless they are 90% tsun and 10% dere. She acts like she hates every guy alive and won&#039;t touch something touched by them, but in fact, she won&#039;t because the monster that took her erotic power when she was a kid said in front of Retto that she was pervert af. She was embarrassed and decided to close her heart to everyone. Really?<br />
- Retto: Ok, he has the will to protect the person he loves and I like his kinda confident character, but he is a cliché.<br />
<br />
All the other characters are just worthless to review, they barely have importance of screentime and are just standard &quot;sexy waifu&quot; type.<br />
<br />
Sound: 4<br />
Nothing to remember, it&#039;s there to do what it needs. I liked half the opening, then it became a little bit arrhythmic, but i don&#039;t dislike it in general.<br />
<br />
Animation, character design and scenarios: 4/6/6 = 5<br />
The animation is decent/bad the most average of time, but good when needed (ehm, fan service).<br />
All the money goes to the ecchi fan service, it&#039;s what the anime wants to sell after all.<br />
I like the character design tho, it&#039;s not generic and can be remembered.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2<br />
I&#039;m just watching this to make my average score lower, I want it near 6 but I don&#039;t stop watching good and decent animes.<br />
<br />
Overall : 4<br />
Most average of people watch this because of the ecchi fan service, just go watch hentai.

    Keep protecting love, everyone is a hero,<br />
Wow Ooooh!<br />
H×EROS... Wake Up HERO!   <br />
<br />
Possible spoiler maybe present.<br />
<br />
Watta pathetic way for studio &quot;Project No.9&quot; to choose it to have an anime adaptation,  wtf were they thinking anywayz? Welp, I don&#039;t any of you out there if you guys were able to view the uncensored version of this junk in some other steaming site, but if you do, I do hope that your little friend likes it, so here&#039;s the WTF:<br />
<br />
Story-Poor 3:Basically its story plot was more like the usual power ranger thing were it was made to be a little bit of the risque side

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357691">
        and yes, it was more on the ecchi, 50% of it was harem , given that them girls weren&#039;t competing for the guys affection and 30% romance given that the guy knows who he likes, the rest were just junk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art-Good 7: For now what was being aired was the censored version, btw there 3 episode that weren&#039;t , but when the uncensored come around that&#039;s were them little friends would stand in attention, know what am saying, LOL? Even so, if ones want it the whole she bang then here&#039;s some sound advice....go to the manga to find out, little friend ain&#039;t gonna be disappointed.... ROFL.<br />
<br />
Sound Good 7: That&#039;s  for the opening theme only &quot;&quot;Wake Up Hx ERO! feat. Retto Enjou (CV: Yoshitsugu Matsuoka).&quot;<br />
<br />
Character-Pathetic 1: Ok, we have a lone guy in the company of 5 girls ( Chacah included) basically represent the very usual characteristics in any series that has a harem genre , like Hoshino, Kirara the quintessential tsundere, Shirayuki Maihime the quintessential dandere, Momozono Momoka the quintessential bokuko, Tekuji Sora the quintessential Kuudere, and Chacha the quintessential loli and lets not forget those from Tokyo branch namely, Muresame Shinko the quintessential deredere, and Wakakusa Moena the quintessential kuudere...I think, as for the guy, well, TBH, he&#039;s just the quintessential bakadere. Ya know only them antagonist the so called &quot;censor bugs&quot; where the only ones that were sensible around here. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment-Poor 3: I only watch , cu&#039;z I was hoping that some awesome will appear, but , alas nothing came up.<br />
<br />
Overall-Pathetic 1: Do, I recommend it? Well TBH , I suggest that you wait for that whole uncensored version and lets your little friend to decide, cu&#039;z IMAO this would be better off as hentai than anything else, does this deserve a season 2????? Don&#039;t ya even think about it bioch. <br />

    Dokyuu Hentai HxEros already gave signs of being more of a generic anime, involving ecchi and little history.  I agree, it is one more adaptation that follows this direction.  But is it really that bad?  Did the combination of superpowers and ecchi work?  Or was there yet another failure?  We will see, in this Review, a parameter of what this anime was.<br />
<br />
 This Review contains some spoilers.<br />
<br />
 Right from the start, I want to emphasize that I rarely watched ecchi anime, especially with this proposal.  Therefore, I may end up changing my mind about everything presented here.<br />
<br />
 Beginning, Dokyuu

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363487">
        Hentai HxEros tells the story of Retto Enjou and four other girls (Hoshino Kirara, the main one, besides being the girl that Enjou likes), where the group aims to contain the advances of a race of creatures  called Kiseichu.  The Kiseichu invade the cities and suck people&#039;s sexual will, that is, after an &quot;abduction&quot;, the individual loses all the pleasure that exists within him.  The main group uses their own perverted powers to fight these monsters.  The fanservice is also present, as we discover that the characters&#039; clothes are torn with the power used by themselves.<br />
<br />
 The anime follows like this throughout the history, alternating episodes of action and ecchi.  This is where most problems happen.  When a work wants to use the action and plans to have more routine episodes, there is usually an interaction between the central characters.  This happens, but as we expected, with one more fanservice most of the time.<br />
<br />
 And speaking of animation, Dokyuu&#039;s production has been dropping over time, which I didn&#039;t expect.  The studio that made the anime (Project 9) never did anything great, but I still hoped to see a consistent and enjoyable direction.  The ecchi might not work and I wouldn&#039;t complain.  However, the factor that bothered me was the outcome, where I noticed a big drop in animation and the narrative itself.  I confess that I was enjoying the work until episode 7, but the rest had bad scenes to watch, either with deformed faces or with the production that was already average since its debut.<br />
<br />
 Returning to ecchi, it is worth showing my opinion about the most controversial genre of otaku.  I admit, I like the funniest scenes, but I still can&#039;t evaluate ecchi in current works.  It may be due to lack of experience, but I already realize that there is some logic.  The anime has its quality in conveying the comedy and even the romance between Enjou and Kirara well, but most of the time it doesn&#039;t.  It&#039;s always a heap of scenes of panties and boobs on the screen, which I don&#039;t like, because the story narrative doesn&#039;t need it ALL THE TIME.  Some examples in which I was angry (I was literally angry with some scenes) are the scenes in which the group&#039;s dog is used as a facilitator in an ecchi scene, in addition to the way in which the protagonists&#039; power is used, where it is necessary to have  moments of urgency and seek an orgy in the last episode.  Nor can we forget the episode of sea cucumbers, where sensual scenes are even more shameful.<br />
<br />
 Another factor that did not make me excited was the fights.  They are not exciting and, again, they are used as a &quot;mask&quot; for there to be a moment that pleases the ecchi fan audience.<br />
<br />
 I can still look at a light at the end of the tunnel.  The anime knew how to work well the romance it created between the two most important characters (however superficial).  It was interesting to see them evolving little by little and revealing part of their feelings.  In fact, that&#039;s what didn&#039;t make me give a lower grade yet.  I managed to like this small part of the story.  It&#039;s not that incredible, especially when it comes to harem-making and seduction by the girls, but I had fun sometimes, it was acceptable.<br />
<br />
 In conclusion, the anime has a few qualities and I managed to find grace in certain moments.  However, there were others who only made me ashamed of others (such as the scenes where the dog &quot;plays&quot; with the girls).  In the end, this is going to be another forgettable work of 2020, where we will forget about its existence in a few months.  I hope that those responsible for the anime get more right in the future (if there really is), because I really wanted to see the romance be better used here.

    Dokyuu Hentai HxEros (2020)<br />
<br />
An absurdly brilliant show for the season. <br />
<br />
The show is chilled, perverted and has a pretty alright story. Here we follow our heroic humans fighting off an invasion of humanoid style bugs that wish only to have pent up energy to survive. I mean what a way to live eh!? We also have the super cute Chacha. <br />
<br />
It is a generic storyline progressing through the battle to battle with ecchiness all over basically.<br />
<br />
The art is a very good standard throughout the show. Characters are generally well-drawn and very cute. It is very much more the side of cartoony at times as opposed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357525">
        to traditional anime when it goes to the enemy but that is fine for this show. <br />
<br />
Sound has a good OP and ED which good too. The OP is pretty out there and unusual as is the ED, to be honest. SFX sound is a good level but could have had more depth. <br />
<br />
Characters develop in the way of Hoshino primarily being our main character for the female side. Enjou does develop greatly but Hoshino is more interesting in her struggles. <br />
<br />
I would say Sora Tenkuuji is the best girl of the show for me the white-haired angel who is lewd and cute all over. <br />
<br />
In regards to enjoyment, I can honestly say it was a good ride. It gets much better towards the end but that doesn&#039;t mean the start was bad. You get a crazy final episode with the forbidden scenario they are in which was amazing in its own way. <br />
<br />
8/10 is the score. Let&#039;s look at the OVA&#039;s that are due.

    My disappointment with Dokyuu Hentai HxEros is probably for a completely different reason than most other people. Story is meh, but what angers me most is the fact that a series that relies on ecchi and nudity censors to an absurd degree. I understand censoring nipples and genitalia so a series can air on television, but when you go into censoring bras, pants, thighs, etc., that&#039;s when you annoy me. I understand the logic of making people buy BDs to get uncensored scenes, but when it&#039;s censored this badly, I almost lose interest completely.<br />
<br />
Luckily, I did find the absolute absurdity of the plot, characters&#039; interactions

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357461">
        and the concept of H energy to be hilarious and did unironically enjoy every episode. This series is wacky, the plot while existent, is subpar at best. What you&#039;re watching this for is not a substantive narrative, but because you&#039;re horny or want to see hot girls in ridiculous situations. Both of which are totally valid reasons to watch something and I don&#039;t fault you. Just don&#039;t expect anything to make sense. It&#039;s a lot of fun and you do grow to enjoy the cast a lot.<br />
<br />
Quality wise, animation is pretty decent, not great, not awful. It gets the job done during the fight scenes. I do really like the character designs of the show. In fact, that&#039;s probably a large reason why I even like the series. <br />
<br />
Kiara and the girls are actually one of my fave female casts I&#039;ve seen this year and I had a lot of fun watching, so for that and the fan-service, it gets a favourable score of 7 out of 10.

    This anime is so cliche and meaningless that I would rather watch James Charles licking men toes. Like how is this trending??? There are better underrated anime like this that needs a second season, and yet people are actually into this?? I&#039;m so done. If your going to make a harem comedic anime, then actually try making a story that would at least give a better context about the character and surroundings, instead of making grasshopper aliens sucking the living sexual desires out of human beings. Can they at least make things a bit realistic. First episode they were literally naked in a playground. LIKE

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350308">
        BRUH. At least show so effort instead of saying &quot; oh hey, lets just put these kids in a playground naked where no one can see them. Also let no one see them while they walk back home.&quot; LIKE WHAT. Anyways that aside, the art was overall decent but a waste for such a trash anime. I feel bad cause nowadays, you don&#039;t get to see as much romance anime that stimulates reality, or impresses you. The only good romance anime I&#039;ve seen come out this year is SNAFU, Sing Yesterday For Me, and Fruits Basket. There are more that I didn&#039;t say but you get the idea. At least To Love Ru and Highschool DxD had a few supportive background to the story. But for this anime. This MODERN anime, its just overwhelming and tedious.

The best way to watch this anime in my eyes is either on blue ray or on gogoanime uncensored, and when it comes to ecchi content, this is definitely right up my alley, and by far the best girl is Hoshino. I typically find tsundere&#039;s either mediocre or irritating, but Kirara is an exception. I mean, you know they had to have done something right when they make someone like me who doesn&#039;t give a rats ass about tsunderes, say that the tsundere of this anime is best waifu of the year. Although this show a lil too much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review374988">
        fanservice for me that I was starting to get a lil tired of it, I still had a great &amp; fun time watching this anime, &amp; seeing what was gonna happen next. The characters aren&#039;t really anything to write home about, but I think the show it at its best when its Retto &amp; Hoshino together, and episode 9 is a perfect example of that. The beach episode is one of the best beach episodes I&#039;ve ever seen, and Retto getting turned into a girl, and chasing the squirrel in his pants was also extreme entertaining. I also really fuck with the art style and the character design, and some other bonuses include the opening theme and the ending theme which I enjoy even more than the opening. Overall, I loved what each episode had to offer as I continued, I think the fan service in this anime is pure gold, &amp; I do believe that this show is underrated af, because a lot of people like to judge shit based on its genre, or they&#039;ll never finish a show, &amp; say its bad. But if your a man of culture like me who enjoys ecchi &amp; teenage adventures, I highly recommend this one, cause you won&#039;t regret it. Best anime &amp; waifu of 2020.

    So I am writing yet another review sure to mark it as helpful if u found it helpful. <br />
<br />
Story, Art &amp; Sound : It does have a real nice and original plot. Show is good with story progression having a nice pace, not too fast and not too slow. Art is beautiful with everything drawn carefully. Good art with stunning performance of the staff. Sound and Art goes hand in hand and are both spectacular. Some scenes are especially good. It is a good blend of Fan service and Nice Plot.<br />
 <br />
Character: The characters are good, but have a few holes (though that was later

          <span style="display: none;" id="review359608">
        corrected but was still somewhat confusing). Backstory and Character development was good and was enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Enjoyed the show a lot, Fanservice is there and not in bulk and had a nice pacing with good flow of action in between. This Show definitely deserves praise. <br />
<br />
<br />
(P.S: wrote the review so that u guys can enjoy the show, loved the show a lot )

    This is an Ecchi that&#039;s on the lower end of the Spectrum. <br />
<br />
It started out rather strong, but went nowhere from there. 10 Episodes in and no real explanation why the Hero is in the Superhero team, because the introduction this time actually was from the gril&#039;s perspective.<br />
<br />
comparing this to Highschool DxD, this time all the characters have horny powers and not only the MC. And for some reason the girls have more horny power than the man. I&#039;m no Ecchi expert, but I think that&#039;s rather uncommon. <br />
<br />
As for characters:<br />
<br />
The MC is your average red haired Ecchi Protagonist, we know this from stuff like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review355794">
        Highschool DxD or Testament of Sister New Devil for example. He&#039;s not really interesting, but he doesn&#039;t spend much time in the focus either - a lot of the story is told from the girls&#039; perspectives. He&#039;s just &quot;there&quot; most of the time, giving exposition to the new girl:<br />
<br />
The Main Heroine. She started off as a very cold person that disliked boys, but after that resolved she got very, very boring. It&#039;s said that she was very perverted as a child, but she actually behaves way more childish now, than she did in the flashbacks as a child. It is SAID that she has very strong H-Power (Hentai Power), but it&#039;s not actually shown. <br />
<br />
<br />
The Plot manages to switch between Slice of Life and fighting Aliens with H-Powers and being bad at both. <br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing a show like that would have going for itself would&#039;ve been ecchi scenes, but they somehow decided to censor underwear even. Sometimes the screen is so black or white, that you have the feeling of watching a youtube video for an audiobook instead of an Anime. <br />
<br />
<br />
So yeah, who is this show for?<br />
<br />
It&#039;s bad at everything it does:<br />
<br />
- Story is way below average, even for an Ecchi<br />
<br />
- The Ice Queen melts in the first episode and has become a naive, childish person with tsundere tendences ever since, but is even bad at being a tsundere<br />
<br />
- everything is censored<br />
<br />
- Fight scenes are laser beams of hornyness most of the time<br />

If you are here to read this review I assume you have a lot of time on your hands. It&#039;s 12 Episodes, so if you really don&#039;t know what to do with your free time, go watch it. But if you have anything better to do, just skip this.

    Brings nothing to the table in the first episode, which is why I dropped it. (I dunno maybe one day i&#039;ll return to watch it.) The anime starts off with 2 cliches, first one being the that two characters in the start are pre-school students that wanna do adult things like hold hands, like in other animes where the characters say shit like lets gets married in the future or something stupid like that. And the other one is that a girl slipped and the mc caught her whilst groping her and she runs away.<br />
<br />
Fight Scenes are just as bad and generic as the main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353113">
        bad guys which are humanoid bugs (how original -_-) and they suck out the energy that makes humans have sex which is called h-energy, I dunno why tbh, the dialogue is so boring I didn&#039;t give a shit. Also about the fight scenes they&#039;re bad, really bad. The mc is running at the bug-person and it&#039;s like he running at a normal speed for his animation but he&#039;s actually running in slow motion or something and then he punches the bug-person and she explodes. (how epic -_-) The bug-person stands there like a statue and lets the mc punch her like wtf he running like a old man with a fucking hernia move bitch!<br />
<br />
Also the mc&#039;s uncle makes him a watch that grants him powers that can kill the bug people because I&#039;d totally give my nephew the burden of protecting Earth from bugs as well amirite guys.<br />
<br />
Idk what else to say its boring looks interesting later on with wolf girls and stuff I think might just skip episodes to see.

    Man oh man I have never thought that I&#039;ll be writing a 10/10 review for the cliche and absurdly titled &quot;Dokyuu Hentai HxEros&quot;.<br />
<br />
I presume a lot of people would look at the cover and think &quot;ah, another of those painful-to-watch animes filled with so much fanservice scenes that it&#039;s impossible to count&quot;, I mean, that&#039;s what I thought too. But there was something that caught my eye in the trailer, maybe it was the good-looking art, or maybe it&#039;s something else. Whatever it is, I ended up watching the show, and I don&#039;t regret it one bit.<br />
<br />
Dokyuu Hentai HxEros (or alternatively pronounced eguzerosu &quot;エグゼロス&quot;) is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358179">
        an anime that directs itself with flashy and often ridiculous scenes, which often revolves around Shimoneta (下ネタ, or dirty jokes) and aims to give viewers a good kick with its absurdity in presenting these elements. Of course, its hard to base your plot around Shimoneta without some explicit scenes, so yes, they&#039;re scattered throughout the anime as far as the eye can see. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m personally not someone that enjoys too much nudity so the excessive censoring (for the TV broadcasts) did help. For viewers that are comfortable with that, I would recommend watching the uncensored version on blu-rays when those are out.<br />
<br />
I mean what else can I say? The show often nails subtle elements such as voice acting, narration, pacing and execution so well that despite being an anime with absurd plot elements (looking at you, One Punch Man), it still feels very well presented. From the subtle changes the voice actors made to their tone (during funny scenes for example. or to bring out absurdity), the way the show places its characters to just outright outrageous situations and the way they (sometimes) play it out in the style of classic children power ranger-ish shows (I&#039;ve never watched power ranger as a kid, so apologize if I generalize these shows too much), everything about this anime just feels like a nicely woven piece of art. <br />
<br />
Well, there ya have it. <br />
<br />
*Review ends here*<br />
<br />
I was expecting to drop the show very early on but ended up watching it in its entirety just because of how perfect everything is laid out. Excessive nudity aside (safely censored if you&#039;re watching the TV version), I really can&#039;t say anything bad about it. There really aren&#039;t any major mistakes or cringey plot elements that I see and to me, that is a good show.
