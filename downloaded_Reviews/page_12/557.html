    &quot;War educates the senses, calls into action the will, perfects the physical constitution, brings men into such swift and close collision in critical moments that man measures man.&quot; – Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1882.<br />
<br />
Yasuhisa Hara’s Manga takes place in the warring state period of China, as the country is divided into seven smaller nations, each trying to conquer the other. It follows a young war orphan named Xin from the Country Qin, who one day on his way returning to his village with his best friend witnesses a battle between two armies, inspired by the spectacle before him, he vows to one day become one of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review87917">
        the greatest Generals alive. The first arc of the show serves as an introduction to the warring times, demonstrating the harshness of living in such times and the brutal power struggles. At this time Xin meets the young king Ying Zheng and after offering his assistance and proving himself, gets drafted into the army and given a chance to turn his ambitions into reality.<br />
<br />
Kingdom showcases some extremely large scale military battles and for the most part does an outstanding job in capturing the atmosphere on a battlefield. Kingdom doesn’t always revolve around the fighting, but on the different strategies the Generals implement to try to gain the upper hand over an opponent. The strategies remain diverse and differ depending on the general and may change at a moment’s notice depending on the situation on ground, showing that adaptation is an important factor. While it does contain an abundance of strategies, it does well in the fact of not overwhelming us with too much of it, the ‘brain vs. brawn’ argument is also laid bare and the series hints at reading the flow of battle, anticipating what your opponent will do and knowing the right strategy to apply always wins the day.<br />

Kingdom also demonstrates that a battle is never a one man mission, it requires co-operation between several squads and sub-squadrons given different tasks to carry out that ensure victory. Our protagonist, Xin, is indeed powerful when compared to a normal soldier, but the series carefully makes sure not to depict him as over-powerful, and it never tries to make the mistake of making him take center stage in a battle, as of course an overpowered MC from the get-go would indeed be boring. At every battle Xin’s squad is given a particular task to perform on the battlefield, this task may mildly or adversely affect the whole state of the battle and after which he withdraws to a supporting role as other squads and different part of the army take the center stage. In the rare cases Kingdom does shy away from the battlefield it deals with simple character interactions or matters of Diplomacy and state.<br />
<br />
The emotions the show throws at you are also immense, battles get so tense it may literally have some people at the edge of their seats and just writhing in agony at the prospects of what may happen next, more so when characters find themselves in a seemingly hopeless situation. Survival is of course the main objective but the soldiers also display a sense of chivalry about them, in the sense of even when greatly outnumbering an opponent, once their commander is killed, they usually withdraw. The pacing remains almost flawless all through, never dragging on but also not moving too fast for audiences to lose sight of it. The script is also very well written, while not too simplistic or psychological, characters engage in smart dialogue that doesn’t seem redundant and is always straight to the point never beating around the bush. Even those pre-battle speeches a commander gives, serves as more than just a morale booster. <br />
<br />
3DCGI has always looked wonderful in games and full CG animations, why? Because these forms of animations have always been aimed at making the art of the show look as close to real life as possible. However, when incorporated in anime, which takes its pride in being different from real life, it’s a completely different story. Its plastic appearance and mechanical motion has made a great number of anime that incorporate heavy use of CG to be assessed as mediocre. <br />
<br />
Kingdom makes extensive use of CG animation, first of all the CG actually has varying qualities, there are times when it looks as terrible as it’s known but other times it’s truly a spectacle to behold. I find myself most frustrated with the quality of the CG at the start of the show, the quality of the first couple of episodes was quite poor and did nothing but chase away any potential viewers who might have wanted to stick with it to the end. <br />
<br />
Once you get past the bad quality of the initial episodes, the animators reward us with some high quality CG that certainly impresses with some great choreographed action sequences. The studio also didn’t fail to take full advantage of the CG on the battlefield, the number of characters drawn on the screen was indeed much but they always made sure these characters moved independently for the most part and not the ‘Foosball table’ combat one may have anticipated. 360 degree camera rotations and different camera positions are also plentiful. <br />
<br />
Despite the shows seemingly low production values, it had a number of very popular seiyuus, the likes of Fukuyama Jun and Morita Masakazu grace us with some very powerful performances, almost all the seiyuus left powerful impressions on their characters. The soundtracks in Kingdom mostly comprise of orchestral pieces and the sound director did a great job of adding the right track to suit a situation, be it a dramatic, comedic or tense moments. Kingdom also spans an OP and three ED songs.<br />
<br />
Kingdom features one of the greatest character growths I have ever witnessed in any anime. Our protagonist Xin, not only grows physically in his strength and sword fighting skills but also grows mentally, when we first meet him, he is your everyday brute that solves all his problem with the throw of a punch or the swing of his sword but as he gains experience in battle he starts to use a bit of intellect to his duties. One can’t help but feel proud of the young lad who rose from obscurity when we see him gain accomplishments on the battlefield and one can’t help but do a victory dance every now and then when he succeeds with all the odds seemingly stacked against him. Even simple events like Xin receiving his first ever payment or him buying his first ever piece of armor are events that truly warm the heart.<br />
<br />
The supporting characters also receive a decent slice of the pie, their personalities of most of them are unique and also at the same time enjoyable, the show has no shortage of standout characters and you may have a hard time picking a favorite. The majority of the female characters in the show in particular, although few and far in between, were all great, they never act weak, play the damsel in distress or used for profane fan service and actually are capable of single handedly dismantling a large number of their male counterparts. Despite the large number of cast, Kingdom does a great job in developing most of them in very enjoyable fashion whilst keeping the pacing near flawless, I was honestly shocked by the amount of content that went into 38 episodes and the show never beats around the bush with needless flashbacks and dragging themes but always stays precise and straight to the point.<br />
<br />
Kingdom has indeed for me been a diamond in the rough, it had a lack luster opening but slowly grew into something impressive. The CG may bring it down a notch or two but it more than does enough to cover for it in with its vibrant story and great characters. The decision of the author to put character growth ahead of everything else has indeed proven a perfectly worked out formula. While the large, heart-wrenching and pulse-pounding battles will receive the most attention, we can’t deny that it was a show that attempted to impress in all departments.<br />
<br />
To create a show with such a large world that almost accurately captures the principles and aesthetics of ancient warfare is indeed quite a feat, but to execute it with so very few flaws, absolutely boggles the mind.<br />

    First 14 episodes =  4/10<br />
14–20 = 5/10<br />
20+ = 6/10<br />
Average=5/10<br />
<br />
In episodes 20–38, a few episodes deserved 7-8 scores, noticeably the penultimate episode.<br />
<br />
_<br />
Comments on plot and characters<br />
plot=5<br />
Comments for episodes 1-20:<br />
The plot is garbage. It just relies on cheap cliff hangers and plot twist to keep the audience watching every single episode.<br />
<br />
The characters are bad. They are superficial, so little is known about them which obscures any possible affections for them. Their dialogue is also atrocious.<br />
<br />
The protagonist is illogically over-powered, and he incessantly spews cringe-evoking dialogue.<br />
<br />
The humour is forced and inserted wherever possible.<br />
<br />
The execution is subpar.<br />
<br />
It is difficult to take this show seriously when its logic is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206399">
        absurd. <br />
<br />
The characters have logic defying strength and super jump. The problem is the show offers no explanation for the unnatural strength of the characters, so it cannot be accepted as anything but a flaw. The only exceptions are the clans that call upon God’s strength because there was at least a modicum of explanation. <br />
<br />
A myriad of plot conveniences run rampant, especially in battle spoiling the mood. Also, the protagonist Xin receives special treatment because he’s the main character as opposed to any logical consequence of the plot.<br />
<br />
A few plot holes are apparent: Xin buying armour and never using it in combat; the absurd battles throughout the anime—a tiny group against thousands; the part where Wei, Ping elected to be a decoy by leaving a blood trail, yet he was able to escape. That must mean they never followed him or caught up which is near impossible; there are also those preposterous premonitions that frequently occur.<br />
<br />
There were no redeeming factors until episode 20.<br />
<br />
Episodes 20+<br />
Pass that, it’s actually enjoyable. Wang, Qi and his army became likeable despite previously being loathsome. Xin is still annoying. The only other likeable characters were the brothers that helped Xin out.<br />
<br />
Some of the negatives mentioned above are experienced to a much less degree or are unrealized. The major flaws are still present, so this arc receives a 6.<br />
<br />
It should be emphasised that armour cannot be easily penetrated with generic swords. A specialised weapon or sword suited to combating each specific armour is needed.<br />
_<br />
Character=4<br />
Most characters were ridiculous and/or unlikeable. These ratings are based on the character design and how well they were used.<br />
<br />
Zheng=bad<br />
Piao=fine<br />
Xin=bad<br />
Lei=average<br />
Diao=bad<br />
Bi=average<br />
Wei, Ping=good<br />
Wei, Dao=good<br />
Wang, Qi=fine<br />
Pang=bad (Too little is known about him, and he defied his own logic when he didn’t beat Wang with his own strength. Also, how the army found him to begin with is rather dubitable.)<br />
_<br />
<br />
Art=9<br />
The animation style (3D and high detail) complemented the war and action theme of the anime. The 3D aspect evoked a vibrant experience. However, seldom are the wounds shown upon contact of the blade. This detracts from the show’s realism.<br />
<br />
_<br />
<br />
Sound=9<br />
Most of the sounds were appropriate, and the sound tracks were superb. However, one absolutely detestable thing was that song or tune that played every time Lei danced. It was abject cringe.<br />
_<br />
Enjoyment =5 <br />
Overall=5<br />

    Kingdom is an anime based on the Warring States period of China. It features Hyou and Shin, two orphan slave boys who lost their families to one of the many wars that took place between the families of the seven kingdoms. <br />
The plot is set right off the bat, when it is discovered that Hyou looks identical to King Ei Sei of Qin (who later grows up to be the infamous Qin Shi Huangdi). Hyou is recruited as a decoy for the king, who is facing rebellion from his own brother within his court. A coup d&#039;etat soon ensues and Hyou is killed in the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review65883">
        battle, believed to be King Ei Sei. He manages to return to Shin long enough to tell him to go to a specific location, where the real Ei Sei is awaiting him.<br />
Thus, the story begins. It isn&#039;t far along at all; only 6 episodes so far. But the story and plot are interesting. If you&#039;re into history, and enjoy the Warring States period, or if you merely only like shounen anime, this is a good one and shouldn&#039;t be passed up!<br />
The only complaint I have is the animation. I have NO idea what happened there, but for some reason, the animation is shoddy at best in some parts. Particularly, the fighting scenes, or scenes with excessive movement, have very poor quality animation, resembling a video game at times. But, if you can look past the animation (as I have been forced to do) this anime is a definite must!

    Have you ever wandered why Dynasty Warriors was not an anime? Well, Kingdom is pretty damn similar. Kingdom is an anime that amazingly and almost perfectly portrays strategic war in medieval China.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10.<br />
At first, I was a bit sceptical about the idea of an anime based on medieval Chinese war. I thought that there would be a lack of a protagonist, that the whole anime would revolve solely around the strategy involved in medieval warfare. However, I was amazed with the layout and structure of the story, and how it caught my interest from the first episode. Kingdom&#039;s protagonist, Xin, is a young, but vastly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review115585">
        strong boy, whose goal is to become &#039;the greatest general under the heavens&#039;. The anime brilliantly shows his progression as he participates in battles to obtain achievements, and seeing him edge closer to his goal makes the anime that much more enjoyable. It may seem strange that an anime based on war in medieval China would revolve around a boy, when one man may seem so insignificant to whole wars, but Xin upholds his protagonist aspect as he makes large differences everywhere he goes.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10.<br />
The three dimensional art of Kingdom may put some off, however, it enhances the sense of Chinese war. Seemingly unique, this art style looks very similar to some Japanese style games, such as Rogue Galaxy. I was a bit sceptical of it at first, but as I breezed through the anime I grew to like it, as without the strange style, it would seem more like a Japanese war, which clearly is not Kingdom&#039;s intended style.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10.<br />
The soundtrack of Kingdom is simply amazing, and it is always timed right where it needs to be. Uplifting music when a general is shouting a morale lifting speech, intense and fast soundtrack when a battle is commencing, it all holds the anime together and makes it all the more enjoyable. <br />
The voice actors starred in Kingdom are also spectacular. Morita displayed outstanding voice acting in this anime. After hearing him voice Ichigo&#039;s calm, soothing tone for so many episodes of Bleach, I could hardly believe it was him voicing angry little Xin in Kingdom. But not just the protagonist has incredible voice acting, every single character does, including the minor foot soldiers that only speak one sentence. <br />
<br />
Character: 10/10.<br />
Each character is developed incredibly. Xin, being angry and blunt. Piao, being intelligent and modest. Zheng, being high, mighty and fair. All of these aspects are conjured brilliantly by each character&#039;s reaction to different happenings. Each general has his own strengths and weaknesses, and no two of them are the same, or even remotely similar. Some may ignore strategy and go full on attack, while others may spend nights dreaming up new tactical defences to best their opponents. While some characters may seem a little useless (yes, that&#039;s right, I&#039;m looking at you, Ten), they too of course have their strengths. Some surprising aspects may emerge from some characters occasionally, which of course is necessary for every anime, and each character has a personality that is finely clipped and demonstrated perfectly.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10.<br />
I wasn&#039;t sure I could enjoy an anime based on medieval Chinese war. The most I&#039;ve looked into this topic is playing Dynasty Warriors 4 on my PS2 for a few hundred hours. However, the strategies displayed in Kingdom are carefully demonstrated to the audience in a way so that anyone can understand, and be a part of. Having a protagonist like Xin in an anime like this gives the watcher another reason to cheer at their laptop like an idiot, and a few other ridiculously overpowered characters bring tears of joy to the audience&#039;s eye.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10.<br />
Through an overwhelmingly well displayed storyline, art that strongly creates an atmosphere of medieval China, soundtracks that bring shudders to your spine and incredible enjoyment, Kingdom has earned itself a place in my top 10 anime. If you don&#039;t like the concept of the anime - Chinese warfare, strategic battles, etc - then there is still a high chance of you loving Kingdom.

    The Art and Animation in this Anime can make anybody think twice about watching it, i even dropped it half way through the first episode. But when you actually sit down and just watch the Anime it&#039;s a whole new level.<br />
<br />
The MC, Story and Character development is Amazing, they way it builds up, the fighting, Character Relations you can&#039;t get enough of it. It makes up for the terrible Animation and makes you just want to watch more.<br />
<br />
The MC overall is someone most people want in a Protagonist. Strong &amp; Ruthless, He doesn&#039;t care about his own well being and relies on brute strength but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review198639">
        can also be quite cunning. <br />
<br />
The story revolves around a lot of Strategy type war over Land across China, I&#039;m really looking forward to see what direction the creator takes this Anime, The upcoming battles &amp; Struggles is full of Hype and Anticipation.<br />
<br />
Overall worth while watch 8.8/10

    ***updated ***<br />
<br />
This review is based on all the episodes that had been aired till now [as its an ONGOING Anime] so this review will be updated from time to time.<br />
<br />
            Story development is interesting . You will get to see all the twists and turns in this anime story , there are many shocking , touching and emotional moments in this anime  . The pace of the story is neither very slow, dull nor is it rushed .<br />
           <br />
    

          <span style="display: none;" id="review72181">
               The animation art is a bit different ,  sometimes it feels like something less than a 3D game art and sometimes its like the normal animes that we watch but hey still its okay and let it not stop you from watching this anime orelse you will miss something really amazing.<br />
<br />
           Both the opening and ending theme song are nice .  The voice actors have really brought out the life in the anime characters , very nicely done especially for Shin [the protagonist - slave boy ] the way he express his feeling , his views  so blatantly, it really bring him to life in the anime. his voice is done by &quot;Morita  Masakazu&quot; the same guy  who has done Voice Acting Role for Ichigo Kurosaki from the anime - Bleach . Also you will notice similar effect in Ei  Sei [the other protagonist - he is the King od Qin Empire] character but in a different way .<br />
<br />
            About Character development , well whatever characters have been introduced till now , their nature , history has been well brought out slowly through the episodes till the current episode , there are many more character who are yet to introduced ,  as you know this is ongoing anime so the best dish will be  served at the last  [hope you understand what i want to say] Anyways you will enjoy both the main character - Xin and Sei , their personalitites, their look at the outer world and their response to various situations, crisis  around them and other characters too.<br />
<br />
           Overall i have enjoyed watching this anime right from episode 1 and i am looking forward to watching the next episode when they air . I  wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone to watch this anime .<br />
<br />
Its a MUST Watch  Anime , you just cant miss it !!!

    Compared to the Manga this Show is bad.<br />
The first Season is almost unwatchable because its very poorly animated.<br />
<br />
But compared to average Shows its still good.<br />
Shin is like a combination of Ruffy and Guts.<br />
But Shin is not the secret to Kingdoms greatness.<br />
<br />
The secrets are the epic full scale wars.<br />
Great generals like Kanki and Ousen.<br />
Battle of Wits on the Battlefield but also in Politics which is displayed here also.<br />
<br />
The english Dub is great.<br />
The Story is of course epic.<br />
Also the animation in the second Season is way better.<br />
<br />
Its similar to the Berserk Goldenage Movies:<br />
You can watch it but its way better to just read the Manga<br />

    MAL lists this is a seinen, but Kingdom is as shounen as it gets. The show can be broken down into two distinct parts: before Xin becomes a general, and after. In the first half, it&#039;s like going to the theaters and watching a war epic, and an annoying country bumpkin kid in the front row keeps yelling over all the scenes with inappropriate commentary that&#039;s so ridiculous and over the top, yet everyone in the theater puts up with it. Take the worst traits of your run of the mill shounen protagonists, from Touma of Index, to Naruto, to Deku and Bakugo of My

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339407">
        Hero Academia, and roll them into one, and we have Xin, a yakuza wannabe Chinese kid who busts into strategy sessions with lame cliched lines, such as, &quot;I don&#039;t know anything about how strong the enemy is, all I know is we need to beat him!&quot; Of course, Xin also yells every time he talks, always pats himself on the back, and is so insecure that every interaction triggers him. When companion He Diao Liao tries to bandage his wounds, he gets angry and wants to fight. He steps on elders and pronounces empty platitudes, and gets commended about his bravery. What happened to those elders? I guess filial piety is not really a thing in ancient China, according to this revisionist author.<br />
<br />
When an enemy king reveals her face and proceeds to give a speech, Xin yells out, &quot;She&#039;s a woman!&quot;, interrupting her, but the scene goes on as if it didn&#039;t happen. When Xin first meets a Qin general, he busts into the room, interrupting the conversation with, &quot;Don&#039;t confuse me with things I don&#039;t understand, just tell me how to be a general!&quot; Xin, of course, wants to be the greatest general, but with less environmental awareness than Luffy at the start of One Piece trying to be the pirate king, or Naruto trying to be Hokage. He&#039;s more insecure than Bakugo, and more fluff than Touma or Deku. This is quintessential shounen delivered in a fake seinen setting. Every time he opens his mouth, it&#039;s as much cringe as the famous scene in Re:Zero.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s more infuriating is how every character constantly tries to make contrived comparisons between Xin and some past legend, hyping him up, and writing off all his indiscretions and bravado as actual bravery. Please! He&#039;s more hyped than Hinata and the Little Giant, and his only achievement is to be talked about by his friend Piao.<br />
<br />
Aside from Xin, Kingdom might have been a mediocre war epic from the 90s, along with cartoonish villains, where every bad guy is a giant mutant like Sloth from the Goonies, but Xin dumbs every character down to his level. Literally every assassin or general he fights, despite them being &quot;professionals&quot;, gasp about how a kid is standing up to their stature, lose their composure, and lose the fight. One assassin, despite being feared for his poisonous darts, says he would not use darts to appear more &quot;honorable&quot;. And from there, Kingdom goes downhill and dismantles itself without Xin&#039;s help.<br />
<br />
In the second part, we&#039;re treated to battles that feign to rely on stratagems, but Kingdom is actually like a shounen fight anime in disguise. Treat the soldiers as an extension to the general themselves in a video game, gaining stat points in vicinity, standing around when not rallied, and charging in when the general is charging. The horses generals ride on are Gundams that sidestep, skid and dance like they&#039;re limb extensions. The generals and key characters like Xin have supernatural powers that allow them to blow soldiers away like dandelions, scale 100 feet tall walls, and charge into enemy camps like nothing. This Dynasty Warriors quality eliminates the role of any strategy. And maybe for that reason, during all three major battles in the first season, the Qin generals each employ ridiculous unicorn gambles where they charge into the enemy camp, and Xin charges in separately to take on the enemy general. When 3,000 allies run into an army of overwhelming odds -- we&#039;re talking like 130,000 -- they run them over like bowling pins, and the enemy generals are somehow surprised by the way physics work in this universe.<br />
<br />
And when Xin, or any other general fight each other, all the soldiers conveniently forget the situation they&#039;re in, or even the soldiers in front of them, and sort themselves into camps to cheer for the duel -- mid-battle! When a general is defeated, all 130,000 soldiers lose their will to fight, and surrender to the 3,000. When generals move their soldiers, nobody notices until those men are at point blank range, then Qiang Lei says, &quot;What&#039;s that sound? The ground is rumbling.&quot; I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they converted Kingdom from a board game like Stratego where pieces are placed onto a board and just magically appear. Every battle is conveniently coerced into a stereotypical shounen duel.<br />
<br />
The formula is perhaps typified 33 episodes in, when a Meng Wu, proclaims, &quot;Strategy cannot possibly stop me!&quot;, as he charges through enemy traps and... makes it out alive. And it&#039;s not surprising when our vice general Teng rotates his weapon, killing everyone in his vicinity like a cheat code. In one battle, the general charges in to make an early attack, and when confronted by an enemy general, they duel, while all his men just stand there and watch, forgetting about the precarious situation they&#039;re in -- why they made the early attack in the first place. Then, Xin proclaims that the most important thing to them right now is not to attack the enemy camp, but to -- you heard me right -- watch the duel.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not making it up when I say Kingdom is one of the most senseless, plot-breaking, shounen derivatives I&#039;ve ever seen, where they took the stereotypical shounen formula, turned it up to 11, and proceeded to wreck their own universe logic in order to maximize the number of Naruto moments Xin gets. Towards the end, they start to introduce magical incantations about Gods or dances or whatever, but the integrity of the anime has already been crushed beyond repair, so it&#039;s not even important that Peng Nuan can ramble on about infusing his spirit with a god, or that everyone collectively refers to him as the &quot;crystallization of warfare&quot;, like crackpots.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t be fooled! If Fairy Tail is a derivative of the shounen fight genre, then Kingdom is like Fairy Tail when the author doesn&#039;t even try.

    KINGDOM sure has underrated rank <br />
<br />
after the 20th episode of this anime and the low rank it has i decided to write a comment<br />
<br />
<br />
i&#039;m a fan of this anime:but only after i looked into the first 5 episodes i grew to love it so those who cannot connect with the anime should give it a try until the 5th episode and after that they are sure to like it <br />
<br />
<br />
the story is about war and not with guns or any mechanic item but swords spears and souls those who love dynasty warriors/swords fight/large scale battles in their anime will sure get to love this one<br />
<br />
<br />
but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review76571">
        what got me into it the most??<br />
<br />
no superpower just the logic of:strong and skilled fighter can win against few unskilled or trained soldiers<br />
 <br />
large scale battles-thousand/hundred/10s<br />
you get to see an army fight with tactics and their skill fighters clash into each other<br />
<br />
scenery that will not disappointed you when they fight!!!!!<br />
<br />
story of conquest-i was waiting for one like this now i got it<br />
<br />
<br />
story-9<br />
art-7<br />
characters-8<br />
look forward to the next episode-10 :D

    A hidden Jewel is a way to describe this show, it started with an average story and graphics and art that where way under achieving but the story was decent enough to keep me watching. Eventually this show became something to look forward. The accomplishments of Xin are something to be seen, the war strategies are fun to watch and even though the show crosses the line into the supernatural it does it in a tasteful way.<br />
<br />
This show has a lot of potential and the art has gotten better, or i have become more accustomed to it, i almost dropped this show right off the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review79232">
        bat because of the art but after the first 6-10 episodes it gets exponentially better.  More excitement, drama and comedy.  Love starts to show its rear side and so does mystery. <br />
<br />
This show is a very complete show with a great story if you go past the beginning and let yourself be taken for a ride you wont regret.<br />
<br />
The potential for this show to end up with a 10 overall is high if played right, though it can also be dropped to a 7-8 if not.  As the story goes at this moment it definetly deserves the 9 I offer it.

    THE STAFF<br />
- Animated by Studio Pierrot, which automatically means a shounen show with average to bad production values. In this case, very bad.<br />
- Directed by Kamiya Jun, who has a most unimpressive roster. His best work was Blue Seed and even that was just an average watch.<br />
- Based on a manga nobody knows about, written by a guy nobody cares about.<br />
There didn’t seem to be much to expect from this show and as soon as it began WHAT A SURPRISE it was indeed nothing. This anime is the perfect example of what a blunt anime is all about.<br />
<br />
1) Boring title<br />
Kingdom??? Just kingdom? Why not the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320941">
        Seven Kingdoms? Why stop there with the trimming; how about just King?<br />
<br />
2) Horrible CGI<br />
The series is made with cell-shaded polygons and it looks completely low quality. Everything feels crude and artificial, from body motions to action scenes. It’s like you are watching cut scenes from a decade old videogame. I give them a credit for trying to experiment on 3D effects in order to better use them in later shows but this leaves the show as nothing more than a crude and eventually failed experiment.<br />
<br />
3) Unimpressive soundtrack and dumb dialogues<br />
There are no interesting songs and the dialogues are all very silly and typical. Nothing to bother listening to.<br />
<br />
4) Lame action<br />
There are lots of action scenes and they are all very basic. Despite having huge armies clashing with each other, you hardly feel any excitement coming out of that. Aside from the fact the soldiers move in a very crude way, they also never get any wounds despite occasionally bleeding a bit. Heck, the mooks don’t even have eyes most of the times to the point they don’t look like people but rather like mass produced blind robots. Even when the main characters are fighting, you hardly get any actual battle choreography, as it is mostly static people jumping around with a few rays of light to substitute motions. Doesn’t that render the whole use of 3D pointless? You are supposed to have polygons for elaborate perspectives and complicating body motions and instead you get the usual frozen cardboards. This doesn’t look any better than your typical 2D shonen show.<br />
<br />
5) Basic story<br />
- The story takes place during the warring states period of China and plays out as basic as possible. If you happen to have watched or read The Romance of the Three Kingdoms or at least be aware of a few well made Chinese war films, this will feel completely dull and childish. I mean the setting is better suited for an epic saga full of politics and hundreds of characters and all you get is a simplistic fighting shounen revolving around a dozen people.<br />
- So what is the story you may wonder? Well, there this bunch of nations fighting each other. A prince is hunted by his usurper brother and befriends a villager boy whose best friend was used as a look alike for the prince. Together they fend off some assassins and head to the mountains where they ally themselves with the mountain folk and they storm the usurper&#039;s fortress. These three lines of text took 15 whole episodes to happen and everything else in-between was either dead time or shounen bs.<br />
- The second arc is supposed to make things more interesting by including battles with thousands of warriors. There are absolutely no significant politics, mind games, field tactics, or common sense; it’s just some imba guy attacking and winning.<br />
<br />
6) Annoying characters<br />
Not only the cast is as generic as it gets, separated to black and white and be easily described in two lines of text, but they also behave in a most immature way. Which makes sense since this is a shounen story. But then again the setting is making you think it will be dark and complicating, when it hardly is and everybody behaves like an angry dumb teenager. It just doesn’t feel plausible.<br />
- The villains are complete assholes with absolutely no depth or redeeming qualities to have a reason to like them even for being evil.<br />
- Damn how I hate how fake everybody acts during fights. They are mostly talking than fighting for their lives. Especially when it comes to mini bosses, they kill mooks in seconds without exchanging a word but when they face the hero they just can’t shut up and just kill him. They also constantly don’t try to slay him in one strike but keep playing with him, as if this is not a duel to the death but a childish game.<br />
- And you think the hero is any better? He will constantly be acting like a delinquent who loves to scream for no reason and will be winning against elites who have decades of experience. He otherwise has no experience at all and wins with nothing more than willpower. You call that compelling characterization? I call it bullshit!<br />
- Even the reactions of the characters feel completely bullocks. Imagine a scene where a professional assassin kills someone. All you see is a ray of light (since the show is not making use of its own technology) followed by a most ridiculous remark by the victim’s friend. “Hey, I know this style of fighting; let me describe it to you in 5.000 words.” Aside from the fact this nobody magically recognizes a fighting style just by looking at a simplistic ray of light, he also does nothing more than infodumping us instead of saying something more natural, such as “OMG HE KILLED MY FRIEND!”<br />
<br />
Thus all you get is a big zero of a show.<br />
<br />
And now for some excused scorings.<br />

    I&#039;ve never been a fan of warfare or of the same sort, but Kingdom intrigued me in a lot of ways. So I gave it a try. I&#039;ve never seen a detailed anime than Kingdom when it comes on old warfare.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story : 8<br />
The story is set on middle kingdom, where 6 states are at war to further their own states. The story revolves around a young slave named Xin. Xin dreams of being the greatest general in middle kingdom. As he pursues this dream of his, a lot of tragic happenings will befall him. His wits will be tested, A LOT. Anyway, that&#039;s the main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review115317">
        plot though. This particular season contains 3 arcs, and I&#039;m only going to tell the first one, and its up to you if you&#039;ll watch the series. The first arc is centered on Zheng, the king of Qin, which Xin(seriously, this names are confusing me in a lot ways.) lives at. Zheng&#039;s throne has been stolen from him, and after some tragically happenings which made me shed a tear or two. Xin will accompany Zheng on reclaiming the throne that was stolen from him. I found every arc interesting so I gave it a 9.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art : 7<br />
The first reaction I made when I first saw Kingdom&#039;s art was &quot;WTF is this sh**?!&quot;. God, it was horrible(maybe its because I&#039;ve only been watching recent animes, so that&#039;s why I was expecting great art.). Kingdom really emphasized the usage of CG&#039;s. A lot of scenes were made with CG&#039;s, so its not unusual to see awkwardly running characters and movements. I considered dropping the series, but! You&#039;ll eventually get used to it though. I would have given it a higher score if they stick on their drawings, I mean, look at those battle scenes which weren&#039;t done by CG&#039;s! Its effing gorgeous! But worry not my fellow art critic! The art in here is constantly improving.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters : 8<br />
Characters on Kingdom really stand out, every main and supporting characters were drawn good. I like how they made some characters look weird. Background characters looked like each other. But its okay, its a warfare series! Who in the staff would want to draw individual looks on one background character if he&#039;s air time is only 3 seconds?!<br />
<br />
<br />
Music : 7<br />
Not much to mention on this one. Kingdom has 1 OP and 3 ED. I only listened to the OP though, it was made by Nothing&#039;s carved in stone. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 8<br />
As far as the story goes, I enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall : 8<br />
It might be weird to say this, but I cried a lot in this series. Now that I think about it, its really hilarious! I want to laugh at myself now. Well, it just might be in the spur of the moment. The camaraderie on Kingdom is really admirable, and the way they make things more tragic amazes me in a lot of ways. The series though is an action packed anime, and I love the strategic things they make, and the way they explained it and how it works in quite good too! Overall, this series is really good. And if you&#039;re looking for action, I highly recommend Kingdom. That&#039;s about my review on Kingdom! Happy watching!<br />

    Well where to start. I came upon Kingdom one day while I was searching the great archives of MAL for something to watch. I saw the picture and read the synopsis and said wow sounds really entertaining. I scrolled down to check out the reviews and saw that is was getting 8s and 9s. &quot;Sounds like Kingdom might be a gem,&quot; I said to myself, &quot;I should check it out.&quot; So I found it and started watching it and oh boy what a gem I found myself in for.<br />
<br />
Story:6<br />
I have to admit at this point, I&#039;m only done watching episode 2 and can&#039;t really go

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212146">
        in-depth at this point. Seems to be an average story so far. On to the next point.<br />
<br />
Art:2<br />
At this point I would like to say something positive about Kingdom. The 2D art is beautiful to look at. Now you might ask me, &quot;If the 2D art is so impressive why would you give it such a low score?&quot; Well I&#039;m glad you asked. See Kingdom likes to think that it is special, and instead of gorgeous 2D animation it decided to use 3D animation that is less impressive than what ReBoot had over in 94. The animation looks bad, especially during the fight scenes. Now this wouldn&#039;t be such an issue if the main genre that Kingdom goes for is action. If I had to come up with a sentence to describe how the fights look it would be this. Remember when you were a child playing with action figures? That is remarkably close to how it looks in Kingdom. Needless to say I was far from impressed.<br />
<br />
Sound:5<br />
From a musician&#039;s view point, the OP and EP were both good pieces that you could skip and not miss a thing. The music during the anime is fine, just completely unmemorable <br />
<br />
Character:5<br />
Now because I haven&#039;t seen a whole lot of the anime at this time, I can&#039;t really say if the characters get flushed out to any good degree. On to enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:9<br />
I feel like I&#039;m going to have to explain this one a little. See it started at about the 5 min mark of the first episode. The characters were talking to someone and I realized something, this might be the worst dialogue I have ever heard in my life. Cheesey doesn&#039;t even begin to describe how awful it is. As an example at one point a character is on the ground saying &quot;I&#039;ll kill them&quot; and he has to say this about 10 times in a row. The delivery is beyond incredible. In fact it wouldn&#039;t surprise me to learn that the Actor had a stroke in the middle of the line and the director just said, &quot;Eh, F it. It&#039;ll do.&quot;. Every single moment that characters are speaking is a gold mine of laughs.<br />
<br />
TL;DL<br />
This is an example of an anime being so bad it&#039;s good. Voice acting is bad, writing is awful and the animation is disgusting. If you can get past that bad animation you can have a few laughs.<br />
<br />
OVERALL:3 out of 10

    Summary:<br />
<br />
(Character names are written differently in different translations)<br />
<br />
The time is warring states of China. Young Xin and his childhood friend Piao, were both orphans who lived as slaves in a small village. At that time a slave had no choice but to be a slave for the rest of their lives. Xin and Piao did not agree with that, so they decided that they will become the greatest generals in all of China. So they trained every day while they were still working as slaves waiting for the right moment to strike. Fate began to move and Piao was noticed by some nobles and taken

          <span style="display: none;" id="review150861">
        to the capital while Xin was left in the village. Turns out Piao was used as a double for the new young king Zheng who was fighting a rebellion by his half brother. In an attempt to assassinate Zheng, Piao gets heavily wounded. Piao manages to reach the village where Xin lives and asks Xin to protect Zheng in his place and then falls to his wound. Xin enraged decides to avenge Piao by killing king Zhao. After meeting and talking with Zhao, Xin decides to follow him as Piao had wished. Here starts the adventure of Xin to become the greatest general in China.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
In my opinion the story is really good, especially if you like history and historic wars. The state of China at that time is really well explained. This anime covers both sides, the battle against the other nations and the battle inside the nation itself. The tactics and organisation of armies are also really well explained and shown, which is the most important in an anime like this.<br />
<br />
The story progresses fine and does not get in useless episodes. It is well written and makes you want to watch more as Xin climbs the ranks in the army.<br />
<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Animation<br />
<br />
No matter how much I love this anime I can&#039;t defend the animation. The animation was just horrible. I already am not a fan of 3D animation and in this anime it just looks disgusting. It was really really bad but the story started so intensely that it made me not mind the bad animation.(the animation gets much better in season 2)<br />
<br />
4/10<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
The sound was good but nothing impressing. Voice acting was well executed and the OST was solid.<br />
<br />
7/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
The anime contains a lot of great characters but I will focus on the main 4.<br />
<br />
Xin:<br />
The main character. At first glance he is like a normal shonen main character but the difference is that Xin has no problem killing his opponent.Well it is a war after all. His resolve and will are strong which makes him a good main character.<br />
<br />
Zheng:<br />
The illegitimate son of the late king of the state of Qin. He is the successor for the throne but his half brother does not agree so a fight ignites between the two. Zheng is strong and always looks like he has the situation under control. He does not show his emotion and his look is always firm, this makes him fit to be a leader.<br />
<br />
Diao:<br />
An orphan from the mountain folks. He helps Xin and Zhao escape from an ambush and latter joins them in the fight against he rebellion. Diao is young and smart but has no fighting strength. That is why Diao decides to become a strategist instead of a warrior.<br />
<br />
Lei:<br />
As member of the female assassin clan &quot;Chi You&quot; Lei is a highly skilled swordsman. Meets Xin on the battlefield and becomes drawn to him for reasons she can&#039;t comprehend. Her only purpose in life is getting revenge for her sister. But as she gets to know Xin more will she get another purpose in life? She is by far the strongest among the foot soldiers and is a great help to Xin.<br />
<br />
overall characters get:<br />
<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
I did enjoy this anime a lot. Even if the animation was shit I could not help myself but enjoy this show. I simply love everything about it.<br />
<br />
10/10<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
This show would get an 20/10(yes 20) if it was not for the shitty animation. That is why I will give it only nine out of ten.<br />
<br />
8/10

    This is a somewhat content based review.You should have at least some knowledge before reading my review. *there are some slight spoilers in it* <br />
<br />
STORY: 8<br />
<br />
The story at first seemed to start off rather weak, but became very interesting later. It&#039;s about two slaves who are as close as brothers; they are always fighting and training against themselves to become stronger. They have a dream to escape slavery and become great generals. their ambition is what fuels them to advance and work hard. At first I didn&#039;t understand why they were so eager to become warriors from them just seeing a battle, but it later

          <span style="display: none;" id="review67657">
        became clear as we find out that that is how they intend to escape their current social stature as slaves. They are orphans who were taken in as slaves, they have a dream and they train tirelessly to achieve it. Later Hyou dies and that&#039;s where things get serious. When he died, I have to admit it gave me goosebumps and really made me empathize with Shin and the pain that he felt. An anime that can make me feel something emotionally is certainly a well done anime. That what I have to say about that.  <br />
<br />
<br />
ART:  6<br />
<br />
I give the art a six because it really throws me off. The animation is far different from traditional animes. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s something new, or if they purposely wanted to make it this way, but is almost feels like a poorly developed 3D game if you know what I&#039;m getting at. I personally think that the animation could have been better.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND: 8<br />
<br />
I give the sound a 8 because the voices are certainly awesome. They main character&#039;s voice is actually Ichigo&#039;s from bleach. Hyou is also some famous voice, but I don&#039;t quite recall what it is. And the guy that narrates for background information is the same guy who does it for one piece. I personally really liked the voices and I think that they fit quite well. The only thing that threw me off a little is Shin&#039;s and Hyou&#039;s voices. the voices seemed a bit too mature for their age, they&#039;re like kids or mid-teens yet they have grown up voices; It throws you off a little.That&#039;s the only thing I don&#039;t like about it. But other than that, I&#039;d say well done on the sound.<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 9<br />
<br />
 I don&#039;t know why but apparently, Hyou, the more outgoing of the two is favored more by others more than Shin is. The family who he is enslaved to treats him better and even the old royal guy who offered him to come with him to be an officer seemed to want him more. I suppose it makes sense though because Shin is more rough around the edges than Hyou (more rude and upfront). But I personally like Shin more, I feel like he has a stronger personality than Hyou. Their relationship is as strong as brothers and they are easy to like. I also feel like the kid&#039;s strength is greatly exaggerated for their sizes. They carried a basket that was like 4 times their size. And shin plowed through a huge group of strong bandits.I get that they are strong, but it makes no sense how they can do all that with their size and proportion...  <br />
<br />
The Characters I don&#039;t like is that old royal asshole who only offered a position for Hyou and wouldn&#039;t take Shin when its clear they would both make excellent soldiers. I also hate the family that the two of them are enslaved to. They are spoiled little pricks who deserve to die, or at least in my opinion. And lastly, the King&#039;s little brother really pisses me off. He&#039;s jealous of his brother who is the king and starts a revolt because of it. He is the most spoiled little bitch I have ever seen. My anger towards him only show how good of a job this anime did in making a decent supporting side character.  I also think it&#039;s stupid that anyone would follow a little midget who has no power and thinks he&#039;s something special. It never does make any sense to me why people would follow such a pathetic excuse of a human being. <br />
<br />
Overall though, I like the characters introduced thus far, and It certainly makes me think more of this anime for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 9<br />
<br />
My enjoyment to this point is fairly high and I&#039;m interested in what&#039;s going on. I feel like this is going to be a successful anime based on what I saw so far to this point.<br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 8<br />
<br />
I give this an 8 total because of the average of all the scores, and I feel that it describes my thoughts on it quite well.  I would definitely recommend this anime. At the very least it is worth seeing yourself. <br />

    A brave anime in an era of fan service and product placement.<br />
<br />
Imagine a large production that has nothing to do with high school, with no fan service, with a well thought and developed story that actually takes its time to mature, strong characters and actual moral impact. Such a thing cannot exist in a time when costs of animation sore, and yet it does, almost a miracle.<br />
<br />
It is an enjoyable series that has taken many risks, from the animation point of view with its 3D effects, to the moments when the story stops to explain medieval military tactics, and last but more shocking the fact

          <span style="display: none;" id="review127943">
        that deals with the tale of one of China&#039;s greatest heroes in a moment when the relation between both nations is in an all time low.   <br />
<br />
I hope it goes on beyond the 2nd season.<br />

    DO NOT TURN AWAY FROM THIS SERIES BECAUSE YOU ARE PUT OFF BY THE 3D ANIMATION!<br />
<br />
There are a few things that really stood out to me about this series.<br />
<br />
1. The morals of the story: Unlike most shounen, Kingdom doesn&#039;t fluff up the fights. If a character is stabbed in the chest, he&#039;ll die. If the enemy has a huge advantage, they&#039;ll win. And willpower can only get you so far when you&#039;re out of stamina. <br />
<br />
2. The main character: Xin. Xin doesn&#039;t hesitate to kill, he doesn&#039;t pity the enemy, and his goal isn&#039;t to get everyone home safely. His goal, to become a great

          <span style="display: none;" id="review101655">
        general, requires sacrifice... and although sometimes he has a hard time with it, he&#039;s able to make a cool headed decision that isn&#039;t emotionally influenced. <br />
<br />
3. The 3D animation: 3D isn&#039;t something I prefer... and was what made me almost shut episode 1 off halfway through. But, I didn&#039;t, and I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t. The animation switches between using the 3D and not using the 3D (so it&#039;s not 3D the entire time). And just like how watching something in Japanese for the first time sounds strange, but begins to sound more natural the more you watch, the animation will also grow on you throughout the show (especially since the story&#039;s so great). The second season isn&#039;t in 3D... the art is rather magnificent, but you won&#039;t get to enjoy it unless you finish the first season!<br />
<br />
That is all.<br />

    I&#039;m frankly disappointed, and its for two major reasons:<br />
<br />
1. The studio artwork, sound, and pacing were a bit off at times.  Some scenes that should have taken longer were cut short and vice versa, the sound was at best average but the worst was the animation.  Not only did it fail to capture the depth of the manga even remotely, but the use of CGI at certain scenes wasn&#039;t appropriate.  I don&#039;t have an issue with CGI use, but it was clear that they were still figuring out when to use and not use it in the first season.  The artwork

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401851">
        also was lacking for some scenes.  <br />
<br />
2. The manga in of itself is lacking.  I love the gritty artwork and historical backdrop, but the characters are severely lacking.  The main character (Xin) is the typical &quot;Naruto&quot; character, with ridiculously long speeches about arbitrary or childish points, superhuman strength, a crudeness that everyone seems to overlook at take as charm?  Him, like many other characters, are incredibly one-dimensional and the entire premise of his character is pretty ludicrous.  The guy is so strong that he might as well be one punch man where the occasional loss is so minor that its really just more plot armor to justify himself being even stronger in a world of already ridiculously strong characters (that get introduced out of the blue to create challenges for Xin to overcome or pillars for him to aspire towards).  It was a great premise, but the execution did not age well and that was primarily due to characterization and how the story revolves around that characterization. <br />
<br />
Is it worth a one-time watch?  Yea...it might even be nostalgic for many people.  But it is a heavily flawed anime, and the 1st season is a mix of its best and worst all in one.  I did enjoy the humor though...

    This Anime would not be well knonwn to the common eye, originally a friend<br />
told me about it, which I reluctantly researched here and further aside.<br />
I came to the conclusion that I&#039;ll get it and give it a go in the near future.<br />
<br />
I flicked through some shows that I was going to watch having taken a break<br />
from watching the 10th last episode of Beelzebub. Watched the first episode,<br />
which I thought was only 24 mins long turned out to be a double episode.<br />
<br />
Paced myself and got into it, the opening song doesn&#039;t really appeal to you<br />
until you start watching and watching it, by episode 20 you&#039;ll like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review112985">
        it.<br />
As for the endings, composed of 3 different ones, #1 and #3 won&#039;t appeal<br />
to most people as they&#039;re quite bad, but #2 was brilliant.<br />
<br />
The artistic style of the anime is weird, at some points it looks like<br />
it hasn&#039;t been hand drawn digitally or on paper, but like a game with<br />
people on axcel movements, but you&#039;ll overcome that if you continue<br />
watching the show.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s two main protoganists, Zheng and Xin. Zheng is the King of Qin,<br />
who has a goal to unit China under one king, while Xin&#039;s goal is to<br />
become the Greatest General among the Heavens and serve under Zheng.<br />
It&#039;s quite a simple story, but throughout the anime you meet new people,<br />
new stories unfold and new paths are forged.<br />
<br />
Many people will be turned off by the low score of this anime, but heathe not,<br />
this anime may be a seven out of ten, but does not subsuquently mean it&#039;s bad.<br />
As the story is quite simply, the anime is overly enjoyed, I&#039;ve had a break<br />
for summer holidays for over three months, and throughout that time, I <br />
barely watched more then one episode of an anime all through the day.<br />
Normally I watch it at night time, when it&#039;s not as roudy.<br />
<br />
Continuing above... After watching the first 5 episodes, I got into the anime<br />
and I started watching it during the day, taking breaks eat, rest or play<br />
League of Legends (3 matches from level 30 on EUW!), only anime&#039;s I&#039;d of<br />
done this for would be Naruto, Bleach and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.<br />
<br />
But it&#039;s not the greatest anime you&#039;ll come across but hey, it&#039;s not about being<br />
the best, it&#039;s about whether you enjoyed it or not, doesn&#039;t matter what other<br />
people think about it, so long as you enjoy it, that&#039;s all that matters.<br />
<br />
As this review is just about finished, I will say, for those whom liked<br />
FMA or Bleach&#039;s Voice actors, then this would be for you. If i&#039;m not mistaken<br />
Xin is Kurosaki Ichigo and another person is Alphonse Elric.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s quite weird hearing Ichigo in another anime, but oh well, <br />
give it a go, see what happens, and most of all, enjoy!

    When I finished Death Note, I was worried there was no way I could find a show, anime or otherwise, as good as Death Note. I was wrong, this anime is a masterpiece on par with the likes of Death Note and Code Geass. If you are a history nerd like me who&#039;s been searching for an epic tale about Ancient China that incorporates all the politics, battles, and strategies for years, this show will be perfect for you.<br />
<br />
Story wise, the show follows Xin and Zheng in their quest to unite all of China during the Warring States period. The story does an amazing job,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308554">
        however, of patiently taking you through the entire process of actually attempting to unite a country that&#039;s been locked in a state of constant war for 500 years. The season starts off pretty small with Xin in his home village, the biggest fight is between him and some thugs from another village, by the end we are locked in a life and death struggle between 200,000 soldiers. The strategies that generals come up with will have you in awe of their brilliance. A story like this could not be told with a movie or a short TV series, the way its been done really makes you feel just what an ambitious goal these characters really have and helps you appreciate just how much work and effort it takes to truly become a legendary general, to wage war after war and unite this country that&#039;s been the scene of tremendous carnage over the past 500 years.<br />
<br />
Whenever Kingdom gets mentioned, somebody always brings up the art and animation style and how much they didn&#039;t like it the first season. Personally, I think the &quot;bad animation&quot;argument has been extremely exaggerated. I honestly couldn&#039;t tell the difference between the &quot;CGI&quot; animation and the normal animation. It all looked the same to me. If you do notice it, I&#039;ve heard that they use it less at some point in season 1, and that season 2 they pretty much stop using it altogether. If you are holding back from this show because you&#039;ve been told the animation is bad though, don&#039;t, its really overblown. I thought the animation was very impressive. Kingdom portrays huge Ancient Chinese battles the way I&#039;ve always wanted to see. Huge armies clash into one another, cavalry charges mow down hundreds of foot soldiers, archer volleys tear into dozens of soldiers at a time, Kingdom does a great job of showing the chaos of battle.<br />
<br />
Going along with what I mentioned about how the story does well to capture the true ambition of these characters, you can really feel the presence that each of the different characters has. Xin is really good at cutting down normal foot soldiers but you can really feel the challenge when he goes against strong enemies. Each of the respective generals gives a powerful air of strength that you&#039;d expect of a general who has seen countless battles in his lifetime. Xin is ambitious, and he does not rise through the ranks ridiculously quickly. When he meets some of the greatest generals in Chinese history, you really begin to appreciate what Xin is up against and trying to accomplish.<br />
<br />
Overall though, I just really loved watching this anime. This is one anime where I&#039;ll look at a season, see that its 39 episodes and think &quot;yeah I&#039;m probably going to finish this in like 3 or 4 days.&quot; I was flying through each episode and had a really hard time getting myself to go to bed. I think this anime deserves more exposure because it really is a hidden gem.
