    *I watch both seaons*<br />
As a girl I really enjoy this Shoujo romance anime. It&#039;s sweet,innocent, motivating ,love story between a prince(Zen) and a commoner girl(Shirayuki). Zen also has loyal friends who aid him in tough times and have fun. <br />
<br />
Story wise is nothing too extraordinary, but is relaxing, the slice of life part is good and funny. I love how the other male characters have good feelings towards Shirayuki, but as a friend or maybe not? <br />
but I was hoping there will be some quarrel because things is just too good to be true, is a fairytale like story after all.<br />
<br />

    I personally think that the second season is better than the first one. Many things were improved and I got addicted to the show. So:<br />
<br />
STORY: 8/10<br />
The simplicity remains, same for the cuteness, the comedy, the slice of life feeling and the sweet romance. What differs in this season is the events, which are more interesting and intriguing. There is a hint of amusing action now as well. Everything about the plot was really great IMO.<br />
<br />
ART: 9-9.5/10<br />
Nothing changed from the previous season, everything and everyone is a pure beauty still.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 8/10<br />
Nothing really changed here as well, the score remains really good and a perfect fit for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217698">
        the anime&#039;s nature.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 10/10<br />
The great characters remained, and became even better. This time we got an even better characterization for some supporting characters and the main cast shone more through the energetic events they faced and due to having some backstories revealed about them. These backstories actually explained  some things about their current way of living and behaving. Due to that, I was able to love them, because each one got a unique emotional pallet and a trademark, and the result was excellent. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 9/10<br />
All the features that made me enjoy the previous season weren&#039;t absent from this one at all. But some extra suspence and the flawless characterization added something more, something more capturing and addictive. I can now say that if there&#039;s gonna be a third season (I SO HOPE FOR THAT *-*) I won&#039;t treat this show as a way to spend my spare time, because now we have a great basis for a great evolution in a really entertaining story and it has become a must for me. Since the manga is still coming out and since there are still questions to be answered, I can only wait and hope that Studio Bones will announce a third season. <br />
<br />
OVERALL: 8.5-9/10<br />
Beautiful, relaxing, light, simple but solid, interesting, funny, intriguing, upcatching and all the other adjectives I used in order to describe the second season but the whole Akagami no Shirayuki-hime franchise as well, make this season, and the whole anime in the end, deserve such a high score and a place in my heart.<br />

    The second season of Akagami no Shirayuki-hime was considerably better than the first. The story is much more stable, although it seems to have compromised some of the characters&#039; morality and stability for that. Although it was pleasant enough to watch, there was still something lacking. I don&#039;t think the creators of this anime did a good job combining action and romance, or at least not as well as some other anime.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the anime became a chore to watch and finish...<br />
<br />
Overall, the anime in itself was pretty good, but I believe the first season took away a lot of the enjoyment and potential

    A new chapter in a story.... that&#039;s what a sequel is. That new chapter may improve the story, or it may make it worse. However, there&#039;s also the possibility that you may enjoy the sequel as much as the story that came before it; for me, that was the case with Snow White with the Red Hair. I had actually watched the first season (and reviewed it), and I really adored it; since I reviewed the first season, I decided that I would review the second season when it was done airing. That&#039;s proving to be a difficult task; I mean, what is there to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214571">
        be said about this season that I already said about the first season?<br />
<br />
In case you are not familiar with this series, Snow White with the Red Hair follows a girl named Shirayuki, who is an herbalist known for her unusual, apple-colored hair. When the prince of her country of Tanbarun, Raj, tries to make her his concubine, she cuts her red hair and escapes to the neighboring country of Clarines. On the way there, she meets Prince Zen and his two aides, Mitsuhide and Kiki, who help her when she&#039;s in a real pinch involving Prince Raj. Upon arrival to the castle in Clarines, Shirayuki aims to become a court herbalist, working diligently toward her goal. Oh, and should I mention the blossoming romance between Shirayuki and Zen?<br />
<br />
The art in this anime is as beautiful as ever; Bones really does a great job in this department. The ending theme, &quot;Page ~Kimi to Tsuzuru Monogatari&quot; by eyelis, is also quite a beautiful song, and I honestly liked it more than the ending theme for the first season. As for the opening theme, &quot;Sono Koe ga Chizu ni Naru&quot; by Saori Hayami..... well, it can never be better than the opening theme for the first season, but it&#039;s still a very nice song! Unlike the first season, which I watched the English dub of, I watched the Japanese version of the second season. I must say, these seiyuus really nailed their roles, especially Saori Hayami as Shirayuki! (Maybe I&#039;m just being a Saori Hayami fangirl when I say that, but still!)<br />
<br />
The story is still kind of easygoing, but there is one arc in particular that may really leave you on the edge of your seats. As for the characters, along with the great character development for the characters already in this anime, there are even more likable characters introduced in this season, especially Raj&#039;s younger siblings; they just put a smile on my face! Speaking of Raj, I never thought I&#039;d come to like him, but believe it or not, I did; his character developed into one that was less....selfish, to say the least. The romance between Shirayuki and Zen was as sweet as ever, too, and it never failed to bring a smile to my face in this season.<br />
<br />
Overall, season two of Snow White with the Red Hair is as great as season one. If you watched season one of Snow White with the Red Hair and liked it, I recommend for you to watch season two. Now that I&#039;ve finished the anime, I&#039;ve either got to read the manga or wait for a third season of this anime about a romance between a girl with hair the color of apples and a prince of the country she arrived in!

    Akagami no Shirayukihime or Snow White with the Red Hair in English is a beautiful Romance/Slice of life anime based in a Fantasy setting.<br />
<br />
The second season in my opinion didn&#039;t have as much of an impact on me as the first season however has it&#039;s beautiful and tear jerking moments, some surpassing season 1.<br />
<br />
The art style is perfect for the anime and the animation quality is top notch. However the story lacks a bit in my opinion as not a whole lot happens in terms of events, but you do learn a lot more about the supporting casts and Shirakyuki herself.<br />
<br />
The anime focuses on Shirayuki

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215335">
        and Prince Zen and their struggles due to the difference in their social statuses. There is a wide range of supporting cast whom are all likeable from the female knight Kiki who is the cool headed badass to the loyal Mitsuhide whom worries over Zen 24/7.<br />
<br />
Much to my surprise one of the supporting cast from season 1 becomes an integral part of season 2 and even potentially part of the main cast, he is favourite male in the anime and totally deserves it.<br />
<br />
If you enjoyed season 1 or are looking for a romance anime then this is definitely one to watch!<br />
<br />
This review is simply my own personal opinion so do not take it at complete face value.

    I did not like the second season very much. <br />
In the second season Shirayuki gets to dress pretty, have tea with her agressor (which, granted, happens to be one of the best characters in this season), get kidnapped, get kidnapped again and cry. There is a whole lot of crying. It&#039;s like she isn&#039;t even the same character anymore. <br />
Once I noticed how little agency* this new version of Shirayuki had, I also noticed that there wasn&#039;t a single thing that had happened because of her. It&#039;s not only that she could be substituted by a pretty red lamp and the story would be the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review253136">
        same, it&#039;s that she wasn&#039;t important enough in her own series to even merit being the reason plot happens. Things happened because people were trying to do something else and she happened to be there. Motivations for characters were reused. It&#039;s just bad storytelling in general.<br />
The break from slice of life into badly written adventure, for instance, felt like something done just to have Zen going all fairy tale prince. There are no consequences for the main characters: nothing is gained or lost from that action. A secondary character does gets to find himself, but he&#039;s the only one impacted by half the season.<br />
<br />
There are, still, a few good things: Raj&#039;s and Obi&#039;s character archs were great, as was that Mitsuhide episode (though he and Kiki get no character development). <br />
<br />
<br />
* No biggie, it&#039;s just she&#039;s the MC. You kinds expect the main character to actually DO THINGS instead of having things done to them. And then cry. While mumbling the name of their lover. ¬¬

    Wow, is pretty much all I can say, I honestly was really entranced by this show. Studio Bones almost always produces very high quality anime and spends a lot on budgets and it definitely shows, there is beautiful art everywhere and our beloved characters are beautifully detailed. Even side characters and characters that have the most minimal appearance in the show are given more detail than in your typical anime. <br />
<br />
I absolutely fell in love with the Beauty and Innocence of Shirayuki and I love how they developed her throughout the show to become brilliant and respected. <br />
The sound throughout all of it is very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310103">
        consistent and offers a nice relaxing background to everything your perceiving.<br />
<br />
I really couldn’t find a single flaw in this show and even liked the villainous characters and plot twists. <br />
<br />
My only farce is that I don’t believe there is any possibility of there being more adaption. Without spoiling anything. In my opinion the Manga does not continue to live up to the expectations and examples we have seen in the anime(which is adapted through the end of volume 8.) And beyond this, you lose what you’ve come to know and love because of how vastly the story changes. <br />
<br />
So going through with watching this Anime you should have the expectation that what you see is all that you will get. However that does not change its value, even this quaint little glimpse of the beautiful life of Shirayuki is absolutely worth watching. Just don’t cry at the end and say “I want more!!!!” Like I did. =p

    I&#039;m a little bit surprised by all the raves for the second season of Snow White with the Red Hair, but to me it was such a chore to watch through. A lot of the positives in the first season - Shirayuki being kidnapped and escaped her own home, fought back against her captors, try to enter the castle on her own talent..etc. kinda lost in this season. Instead, Season 2 devolved into exploring the side characters more (not bad in itself) but the role of damsel-in-distress from Shirayuki get worse here. <br />
<br />
Where is my capable heroine?  All Shiruyaki did this season was drinking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397985">
        tea, lecturing Raj, got herself captured by some evil pirate lady, and conveniently rescued by Zen. <br />
<br />
The only positive episode that I truly enjoyed was Mitsuhide&#039;s loss memory arc, which was hilarious, and his backstory with Kiki. Even Obi shine here in this season. As for Shirayuki, I don&#039;t know, if we replace her with a lamp, I feel like the story wouldn&#039;t change much. She continued to feel happiness in her relationship with Zen, reunite with her father, and be in good companies of her friends. It&#039;s hard to care about her when I&#039;m not exactly sure what&#039;s the conflict in the story for her character is anymore, and the lack of portraying a shojo heroine with more negative emotions - anger, hatred, pain, kind of make it less relatable to follow through. I guess maybe I&#039;m a little bit too old and jaded for some feel-good shojo romance. What a shame, beacuse the 1st season of Snow White with the Red Hair was pretty decent.

    I already have reviewed the first season, and the second season definitely improves in many areas. Some may say that some of the characters aren&#039;t being consistent and that may be true, but I want to think of it as changing or evolving for sake of the story. The first season felt okay, but there wasn&#039;t really much story to it as it just, more or less, about the development of the main characters. This time around, the second season actually have quite the plot and there is a little twist in it too. The progress of second season felt appropriate and actually makes you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262834">
        want to continue. Right near the end, we come to learn more about some characters which is great because the first season lacks background characters for a few. Second season adds more to the characters while progress with the story for the better. I am satisfied as how the anime ends, but also felt that there can be another season to end it even better. I guess by doing so, there is good chance of risking a good anime towards downfall though, I suppose. But in any case, if this review isn&#039;t enough, I&#039;ll go a little more depth on the bottom without spoiler as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Story: Improved over the first season. There&#039;s a real &quot;bad&quot; person this time and there will be more action (fighting) which is often a good thing under my book. The progression of the story and plot felt appropriate enough that us viewers won&#039;t be irritated and would like to know more. Of course, what interest us is, more or less, subjective. Although, I understand this anime is meant to be shoujo and light-heart to watch, but felt it could have been more realistic like a few characters that impact us dies, like how in Game of Thrones, the writer was not afraid of killing goods guys and important characters. This is the only thing that lacks in the story the most. Because it usually never serious about anything and felt rather fluffy. <br />
<br />
Art: Same as the first one. If you have watched the first season, then you should know what I mean.<br />
<br />
Sound: Same again. Good Opening &amp; Ending.<br />
<br />
Character: A little bit better. For one thing, I&#039;m glad there&#039;s history about Obi and little bit of Kiki. I still would like some history of Haruka, Zen&#039;s father and mother and Izana though. So, I was a bit disappointed in that. But otherwise, some new characters shed some light which is pretty cool. On the other hand, for the &quot;bad&quot; person, I wish there was a little more to it than just plain &quot;bad.&quot; <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: It&#039;s a fun watch just like the first season. The second season is slightly tense.<br />
<br />
Overall: From the start to the middle to the ending, it does what the writer intended to do. It&#039;s a show about romance and in a fantasy setting. If you like something like Juliet and Romeo, this would be a good anime to watch.

    I will try to keep this review short and simple. Basically, this story is quite good in my opinion. It takes a place in a fantasy setting, which is quite different and unique from other shoujo anime. However, there are some clichés and the characters are quite bland. But I still think this anime is really good and kind of enjoyable for a romance / slice of life anime. If you are that kind of person who likes to judge and criticize an anime based on how good the plot, characters etc, then this anime is not for you. I will recommend this anime to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401509">
        people who just wants to relax. By the way, I think this season is better than the first season because there is some amazing action scenes in it, which makes the story more interesting.

    (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)<br />
<br />
I’ve never liked apples.<br />
<br />
Sure, their outer casing is both shiny and biodegradable. But it’s a literal chore to completely peel the skin off (if one does not have a utensil or does not like the taste). Plus, they hurt my teeth. The acidity has always ruined any chances of me eating anything more after consuming these “toxic” fruits.<br />
<br />
Akagami no Shirayuki-hime 2nd Season features an apple of sorts. But, thankfully, it is an apple that is far from toxic.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Akagami returns for the continuation to its split-cour. To be expected, Shirayuki, Zen, and many others return as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review248817">
        well for more fairy-tale happenings.<br />
<br />
Looking at Akagami’s narrative as a whole reveals an interesting direction. Two-thirds of the season are dedicated to a single, long-lasting conflict. The last one-third is comprised of episodic, slice-of-life events one right after another.<br />
<br />
The decision to split up the season in this fashion holds both positives and negatives. On the positive side, the season gets all of its tension out of the way early to make way for lighthearted fun and frivolity. Plus, by keeping the two halves separate, the major conflict remains focused as opposed to lost amongst the laughs and gaffs. On the negative side, ending the season with arguably pointless material makes the narrative come off as aimless, possibly lost. Also, the shift from heavy drama to almost no drama makes said heavy drama lose weight.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, the narrative’s structure holds a different purpose: it matches the tone of the anime itself. Shirayuki is “forced” to go back to Tanbarun and away from Clarines, the place she (now) calls home. So it makes sense that, as she struggles with leaving behind both her work and more importantly Zen, she encounters more troubles abroad. Practicing being a proper lady. Finding herself lost in an underground labyrinth. Getting kidnapped from her kidnappers. In other words, where the first season brought balance, this second season brings imbalance.<br />
<br />
It is not until Zen, Kiki, and the others arrive, and subsequently the whole gang gets back together again, that she feels safe. That she feels at home. And so the events from then on reflect her comfortability. Obi being reacquainted with an old friend. Mitsuhide acting goofy. Zen treating Shirayuki as the love of his life. Balance.<br />
<br />
Not all of the events manage to maintain execution, however. The stopwatch that Zen gave to Shirayuki meant next to nothing narratively despite earning some importance. An argument for it breaking and its time stopping has some nice symbolism to it (her “time ended,” both for going home and possibly her life), but the watch does not actually serve a grander purpose.<br />
<br />
Also, the whole Shirayuki’s-father idea almost comes out of nowhere and has little impact on the events after the revelation (since it comes at the end of the long conflict that goes right into the laidback events). It does continue with the anime’s theme on home and leads to Kazuki kidnapping Shirayuki (by misunderstanding her situation), but it is still a weak inclusion.<br />
<br />
And it was a bit too convenient that the one dude just happened to have family that did business with the Claw of the Sea which led to them invading their hideout.<br />
<br />
Yet the worst problem, a problem inherent with the given structure, is the separation of Zen and Shirayuki. Technically speaking, Akagami is meant to be a tale about Shirayuki and Zen. Not Shirayuki and Raj. Not Shirayuki and Obi. Shirayuki and Zen.<br />
<br />
To be fair, the forced separation does have purpose. Shirayuki does nothing romantically with the other two, solidifying her feelings. The direction helps those two men rather than Shirayuki herself (more later). And their time away from one another allows them to understand that what they miss most is each other. But when Shirayuki is away from Zen and vice versa, it disrupts what the anime is supposed to be about. I.e., Shirayuki and Zen.<br />
<br />
The long conflict is not without its happy or funny asides. The slice-of-life episodes are not without their own conflicts. And Shirayuki and Zen do share a lot of moments together regardless of the separation. Meaning, overall, the narrative rests on middle ground.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
As to be expected of the second half to the split-cour, the art and animation levels remain as high in quality as they were with the first half.<br />
<br />
Coloring in particular is vibrant once again. The landscapes are painted with greens, blues, and purples to get back to that fairytale feel. Lighting also contributes to this feeling – sunsets, nighttime moonlight, and sparkles galore fill many sections of the show.<br />
<br />
The animation levels are back, too. During fights, characters jump, swing, and dodge against their opponents. Choreography also makes the fights more fun to follow. When fighting is not going on, the characters’ hair, eyes, and clothing likewise see fluid movements that keep the show from being static.<br />
<br />
And the character designs do not change too – a clear positive. Shirayuki herself gets a few extra outfits, like the one she wears to the ball and the one she wears when Prince Izana summons her to receive her reward from Tanbarun. Zen, Mitsuhide, and Kiki’s designs return as well, and, similar to Shirayuki, Kiki gets an extra one during the fake marriage interview with Zen that perfectly captures her beauty.<br />
<br />
(Thinking more on the coloring of their hair, these couplings hold weight. Red and white are colors that complement one another well. Much like Shirayuki and Zen do. Similar thoughts can be written about yellow and blue for Kiki and Mitsuhide respectively.)<br />
<br />
New characters receive nice designs as well. Umihebi, the leader of the Claw of the Sea, looks intimidating with her yellow-green eyes, ponytail, and multiple pieces of clothing. Mukaze, the leader of the Lions of the Mountain, probably gave Shirayuki some of his hair genes (but not his sense of clothing), considering his faded, brownish-red hair. And Torou dons the femme fatale look with her long brown hair, nice figure, large earrings, long skirt, and white boots.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, there are a few hiccups. The rocking of the characters in the boats during the whirlpool pursuit was not handled with care. And Shirayuki’s smile as she spins in the opening track’s visuals makes her look more goofy than cute. But the rest of the art and animation make up for these small grievances.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
Interestingly, the anime does not place too much focus on Shirayuki’s and Zen’s characters. Instead, most of the attention goes to two other people: Raj and Obi.<br />
<br />
Raj was the prince from the first season who initially tried to steal Shirayuki back after she ran away from his snobby eyes. When he later visited Clarines, he was scared out of his mind given his promise to Zen to never see Shirayuki again. These characteristics, snobbishness and courage, are what the anime targets for this season as well. But rather than inflating them further, the goal is to reduce them.<br />
<br />
To this end, Raj invites Shirayuki to Tanbarun. Part of it is a test for Shirayuki and Zen on Izana’s behalf – to see if Shirayuki can successfully prove her worth and hence her (in Izana’s eyes) compatibility with Zen. Part of it is to see Shirayuki’s compatibility with Raj. And the biggest part is Raj wanting to mend his relationship with Shirayuki regardless of the feelings involved.<br />
<br />
Thus they learn more about each other during their time together. Shirayuki learns of Raj’s violin skills as well as willingness to better himself. In turn, Raj learns of Shirayuki’s trust of others and of her thoughtfulness which she uses with everybody.<br />
<br />
Raj’s younger siblings have kindhearted intentions with their meddling, but Shirayuki and Raj both understand that they do not love the other as lovers but rather as friends. Where their relationship was once in a rocky spot, it is now exactly where they want it to be.<br />
<br />
The culmination of their time together was originally supposed to be their dance at the ball, but, when Shirayuki gets kidnapped, Raj finds himself needing to test whether or not he has left behind his snobby and fearful days of old. That is, he needs to prove whether or not Shirayuki has left a lasting impression on him.<br />
<br />
And prove he does. He opts to join the horseback chase after the Lions of the Mountains. He makes a personal appearance before his people, pleading for their aid in his time of need. He leads the charge after the Claw of the Sea, declares his friendship with Shirayuki for all to hear, and courageously carries his men through the raging whirlpools. All choices that demonstrate Raj has changed for the better.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, he and Shirayuki finally do have that dance (with the music Shirayuki had pointed out at an earlier point), but, to reiterate, this send-off is not the highlight. Instead, it comes with the necklace and official decree of her new title: “Friend of the Crown.” The letter Raj writes for Shirayuki is kind, reflective, and sincere, indicating without a doubt that Raj is finally the kind of prince, the kind of person, that Shirayuki always knew he could be.<br />
<br />
Next to Raj, Obi is the other prominent character. The first half of the split-cour initially had him as an enemy of Shirayuki and Zen. Very quickly, he finds himself working for his new master Zen, and he also finds that he has some feelings for Shirayuki himself.<br />
<br />
Near the start of this second half of the split-cour, Obi is still in the same spot. When Shirayuki must go to Tanbarun to prove herself, he duels Zen for the honor of accompanying her. Obi surprisingly wins – giving him the chance to also prove his worth to Shirayuki.<br />
<br />
Obi has generally looked over Shirayuki from afar, but this opportunity allows him to look over her while afar. He behaves the same, too. He guards her, tracks her whereabouts, and escorts her when necessary.<br />
<br />
Yet when she needed him most, he fails. The (first set of) kidnappers arrive with impeccable timing, defeating Obi and stealing Shirayuki. He did not prove his worth. Whether it was because of his feelings for her or because of his pride, it does not matter. All that matters is that a switch flicks on within Obi – and anger brims forth.<br />
<br />
He finds one of the kidnappers, the glower on his face indicating easily enough his current mindset. When Zen finds him, though, he gets scolded by Zen. Not for losing Shirayuki but for making Zen worried about him, too. This small interaction sets the seed for his eventual weening.<br />
<br />
For that’s a major motif of Obi’s character during this season of Akagami: weening away his deeper feelings for the red-headed girl. Zen’s trust in Obi affects Obi since it is something he is not used to. Shirayuki (after being rescued) asks him to continue helping her, simultaneously easing his mind about his failure and indicating the kind of relationship they share (i.e., a friendly one, not a romantic one). And the episode afterwards, where his friend from the past reappears, allows him to understand that he likes the friends he has in the present and does not want to lose in the future.<br />
<br />
The culmination of his character comes when he gets Zen away from Mitsuhide’s overprotection. He encounters Shirayuki but leaves her to get Zen, indicating his newfound outlook on himself and the group he cares for.<br />
<br />
Both Raj and Obi highlight a specific theme among the characters: understanding one’s self and where one wants to be personally.<br />
<br />
The story targets something similar – the idea of one’s home – but that is more physical. This theme is more mental. Raj confronts his shortcomings. Obi learns about what he truly cares for. Shirayuki and Zen know they want nothing else but each other. Even Mitsuhide and Kiki learn about themselves – Mitsuhide and Kiki care for their prince and, more than implied, one another.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Shirayuki and Zen, they feel the negative effects once again of not holding the spotlight. Shirayuki does grow in terms of proper ladyship, but she has always been confident and determined, so the change is more minor than major. Plus, the longer conflict has her (once again) getting dragged along against her will. She has to wait for everyone else to rescue her rather than her rescuing herself – a lost opportunity.<br />
<br />
Zen gets it even worse. Obi takes his spot for the major conflict, and, once back home, his biggest change is not averting his older brother’s gaze. Weak. At the minimum, his actions and words make it more than known that he loves Shirayuki. Even if their relationship is not as official as it could be.<br />
<br />
The other side characters are a toss-up. Kazuki’s defection does not have much exploration but his role as homewrecker works. Prince Izana only commands and laughs, but he forces the characters to act. And both Mitsuhide and Kiki do not have their own romance blossom, but it was appreciated that they got some attention after almost two whole seasons of nothing.<br />
<br />
Altogether, the cast is filled with positives and negatives that ultimately balance one another out.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The opening track is leveled in its approach. The start is slow with the singer and instruments working at a methodical pace. The halfway point builds up the emotion, giving way to a second half that is slightly faster and slightly loftier. Not a lot; just a tad. Weirdly, the piece comes off as simultaneously grandiose yet not-quite-so, leaving it in a less-than-ideal spot. No matter how fairytale-esque it may be.<br />
<br />
The ending track somewhat follows in the footsteps of the OP, but it picks up the pace a bit earlier. It still has the same leveled tone, but the ED is more of a happy piece than it is a fairytale one. The final held note from the vocalist proves her strength, but the entire track leading up to the end lacks emotion and power – details that a single strong note could not hold up.<br />
<br />
Sandwiched between the OP and the ED is the rest of the original soundtrack. Luckily, it contains the same lovely tracks from the first half of the split-cour. Dainty tunes, magical ensembles, and romantic arrangements come together to make Shirayuki’s second tale feel like a fantastical story once more.<br />
<br />
As for the voice acting, it sits somewhere around average once again. Saori Hayami as Shirayuki and Jun Fukuyama as Raj deserve the only shout-outs. Ms. Hayami’s soft way of speaking and Mr. Fukuyama’s frazzled yet determined voice help to make the characters stronger than they would be otherwise.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
Like many anime for me, this one was somewhere in the middle.<br />
<br />
Those first seven or so episodes, while containing spurts of romance or other such happiness, were not the most entertaining. Relegating Shirayuki and Zen to more of a side role, and thereby reducing the amount of overall time they spent together, was not favorable. The action was not all that impressive. Umihebi and Kazuki were not interesting characters regardless of their respective affiliations. Raj and his younger siblings were thankfully around to make these duller parts more entertaining.<br />
<br />
I also was not a fan of the anime (still) thinking about the Obi route. Not that he did anything overt. Just the long bout of subtleness – the way he looked at her or the words he said – before he made up his mind to back off had me somewhat frustrated.<br />
<br />
The last four episodes, however, were a major delight.<br />
<br />
I laughed extremely hard at Shirayuki’s dad yelling immediately after Zen declared his feelings of love for her. I half expected a response of that nature, but the quickness and loudness of his response made me laugh uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
Mitsuhide’s specific episode was a lot of fun, too. Especially when he accidentally knocked Kiki over. He grabs her waist and hand as he speaks gentle words in her direction. But it was Kiki’s absolutely disgusted response (“Huh?”) and expression that had me laughing hard. Obi’s own stifled laughter was a bonus.<br />
<br />
Mitsuhide getting visibly angry (in a comedic way) when Obi brought up Kiki getting approached by other men. Zen’s intimate moment with Shirayuki in the garden and up atop the tower. Kiki not denying Obi’s (incorrect) recount of what Mitsuhide said (about her being the most beautiful woman in the world) while he was delirious. All funny and likable moments.<br />
<br />
I am talking about Kiki and Mitsuhide so much because I wish the anime would have made their more-than-obvious romantic pairing more definitive. But I suppose that will have to wait for another season sometime soon.<br />
<br />
Akagami no Shirayuki-hime 2nd Season is not an amazing anime, but it does do a lot right. Character development for a couple of the members of the cast. A purposeful narrative structure. Nice comedy, art, and music too. Unfortunately, the forced separation of Shirayuki and Zen has a ripple effect across the entire show. They say an apple a day keeps the doctor away. Or one can just use this anime as a supplement instead. Maybe.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Fine, a quirky narrative structure, a theme on home, and other problems (inherent or not) balance everything out in the end<br />
<br />
Animation: Great, colorful artistic direction, above average actual animation, and nice character designs<br />
<br />
Characters: Fine, Raj is great, Obi is good, and the rest either serve their role or needed more but never got it<br />
<br />
Sound: Fine, okay OP, bad ED, great OST, okay VA performances<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Fine, a less-than-fun first two-thirds gives way to a more-than-fun last one-third<br />
<br />
Final Score: 6/10

    Although I absolutely adored the first season of Shirayuki, I must admit for the first few episodes of season 2 I couldn&#039;t decide whether I liked it as much. At first, I felt a little bit like the show had lost some of its magic... and maybe it was because Zen and Shirayuki were apart for a while, maybe I just didn&#039;t enjoy the plot arc quite as much... I don&#039;t really know. But, it didn&#039;t really take away from my score too much, as it seemed to pick up for me again after I made it through the first 5 episodes or so, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217008">
        once again I fell in love with this sweet story &lt;3<br />
<br />
Firstly, I have to comment on the art again. I just love it. I think it might be the most beautiful style of anime art that I&#039;ve seen. It&#039;s so colorful and detailed without being over the top, and it really adds to the magical, fairytale feel of the show.<br />
<br />
As for the story, like the first season, it&#039;s really nothing original. But to me, fairytale romance almost never gets old, unless it&#039;s just blatantly cheesy to a ludicrous extent. Starting off with this season I was not a huge fan of the whole thing with Obi and Raj suddenly showing feelings for Shirayuki. Not that I necessarily have a problem with harem or reverse harem or whatever, but for this show the idea wasn&#039;t working for me. Luckily, that whole fiasco wasn&#039;t shoved down my throat or anything, and ultimately didn&#039;t become a main plot device. Thank heaven.<br />
<br />
Character-wise, I like just about all of them. Shirayuki and Zen are both great in my opinion. Like last season, Shirayuki is kind and gentle, but also intelligent, resourceful, and strong-willed. I&#039;ve always thought she was quite a human character, one with different sides to her, but nothing drastic like a sudden fit of violent anger as shown in a lot of anime. She experiences many emotions, happiness, sadness, frustration, etc... and I like that about her. Zen is also pretty awesome. He&#039;s like the ultimate prince charming, but better, because he has a personality. He tries to act smooth and confident, but even he gets flustered or upset at times. And his love and devotion for Shirayuki... simply swoon-worthy. Speaking of their relationship, I just thought I&#039;d mention that I appreciate how the two of them actually talk about things. Any time there is an issue, they actually discuss it like normal people in a relationship are supposed to do, which is something I don&#039;t see all that often in anime. Usually, misunderstandings build up until someone explodes for no reason and then there&#039;s unnecessary conflict that could have been avoided... luckily, Shirayuki and Zen are mature enough to handle the bumps in the road with grace and dignity.<br />
<br />
I also liked the other characters, many of whom got some more development this season. I like both Kiki and Mitsuhide, who are both awesome and very loyal friends. Obi&#039;s an interesting character as well, and I thought it was cool to get a glimpse of his past. I&#039;m hoping to see more of that in the future, perhaps if I read the manga. And even Prince Raj, holy snap... he was such a scum bag in the first season, and yet he somehow grew on me. Amazed.<br />
<br />
I think the only character I don&#039;t like is Zen&#039;s brother... partially because I don&#039;t get what his deal is. I find him a little disturbing at times, and it almost seems like he just, for no reason, finds some kind of enjoyment out of messing with Zen and Shirayuki in twisted ways. He just... creeps me out.<br />
<br />
In any case, I really loved this show. The whole thing, both season 1 and 2. Even if this one took me a couple episodes to get into it, I&#039;m still glad I watched it and I think this series will forever have a place in my heart. It will definitely be my go-to in the future for days when I&#039;m feeling sad. Sigh... don&#039;t we all wish we had our own fairytale romance?

    &quot;Red is the colour of Fate&quot; <br />

It is very rare that when I start watching a show that by the time I finish both seasons I find myself thinking, &quot;that ended perfectly and I honestly hope for no more seasons&quot;. Akagami no Shirayuki-hime was one of those shows that sticks with you like a hot glue gun sticking to your skin. Except a lot less painful, as you would actually enjoy watching this show. I hope you understood my metaphor. TL;DR - this show sticks with you<br />
<br />
The story continues from the last season (obviously) and is executed well--if not better than the first season--making it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226676">
        enjoyable to watch. The art is phenomenal (as is the sound) resulting in a very calming show to sit down and watch on a lazy weekend. The characters stay much the same, as is mentioned multiple times by the characters as to show that not much has changed.<br />
The only exception to this would be Raji, who gets his own character arc for a while in this season, making him one of the main characters. <br />
<br />
The show easily gets a recommendation from me and is one of my favourite romance animes, making it a real shame that I originally dropped Akagami no Shirayuki-hime after episode 3 when it was first airing due to how slow it originally felt. I&#039;m glad I picked up this title again because I would&#039;ve severely missed out if I&#039;d not continued watching it.

    Adorable. Cute and wholesome and simply adorable. If you&#039;re looking for something with an intricate plot and a lot of drama, you&#039;re not gonna find it here. But let&#039;s face it. If you&#039;re watching this, you&#039;re not watching it for the plot. You&#039;re watching it for the relationships. It&#039;s a plain and simple love story, no more, no less.<br />
<br />
Even side side characters get relationships and they&#039;re super cute, too. (Actually, some of them are almost better than the mains.)<br />
<br />
If heartwarming fairy tale romance without a lot of drama is what you&#039;re looking for... you can&#039;t get much more on point than this.

    If I could describe this anime in one word it would be: pure. It&#039;s such a cute and innocent anime, and one thing I always complain about is when there are a lack of romantic moments in the series, but this one had just the right amount! <br />
<br />
I REALLY love Zen, his personality, his charisma, his looks. Literally everything about his character is so nice. He&#039;s confident in any situation, unlike the prince of Tanbarun, and he just oozes charisma and charm. His character was very nicely done.<br />
<br />
I also like how each main character got their own story and we saw a bit of history

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344941">
        for them. A lot of times, the other main/side characters (Mitsuhide and Kiki and Obi) would just be there for the purpose of &quot;bettering&quot; the MAIN characters (Zen and Shirayuki), but they had their own stories and I loved that.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed watching it, it was so cute and pure that I couldn&#039;t help NOT enjoying. I definitely preferred this season to the first, but the first was also well done.

    Kyaaaannnn!!! This was such a good continuation!!! From the dangers, to the resolution, to the character development and even the way it wrapped up! Loved loved loved it!! Too bad it was just 12 episodes!! I would have wanted more!! But I appreciate them for not wrapping it up in any way that would deviate from the main story. After all the manga is still publishing! I absolutely hate it when animators destroy the main story just to wrap up an anime! So I appreciate the ending and I will of course go on to read the manga!! Love this story way too much to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332406">
        stop here!!<br />
Absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a lovely story about love, royal obligations, rising to meet and overcome challenges, and working hard to make the dreams of the ones you care for come true! It was lovely!!

    I was about to give this anime 10\10 because it&#039;s a masterpiece, other than that, I&#039;m in love with 2nd Season and I think they improved everything here, OH MAN, it been a while since I watched a Shoujo with amazing characters and a good plot and pure love that make sense, the romantic moments between the main characters gives me butterflies in my stomach <br />
<br />
Plot: 9<br />
you have an idea, you work on it, add some spice.. here you go, fantastic anime<br />
the pure love was touchable and also the story is<br />
<br />
Characters: 9<br />
Shirayuki apple head is a character I&#039;d absolutely love, she strong and has a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332123">
        goal to reach and works on her self<br />
Zen the 2nd prince also a character I&#039;m in love with, he is honest with his feelings and treats Shirayuki well<br />
my favorite Character? *drums*<br />
Obi!<br />
Do you know when the main character who spouse to love and be loved is the best character of all the anime? yes? that happened here yes.. but the other main characters had a role to play, they didn&#039;t have much but they had, and here when I choose obi, he tried to kill her then it turns to fall in love with her, One-sided love, instead of telling her, he choose to protect her and be by her side, he is a character you want to discover<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
yes you deserve it<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
I liked the 2nd more, and you will like it too<br />
Re-watch?<br />
when I lose my memory I&#039;d like to watch it again<br />

    First things first. My &quot;reviews&quot; system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.<br />
------<br />
<br />
Reviewing it weeks after watching.. sort of couldn&#039;t get around. So will review as my memory lets me.<br />
Also this review makes me wonder If I should ever bother adding voice acting general gist as well into reviews..Hmm, not sure if can be bothered. But if anything utterly noticeable regarding VA I hear/see. I will add in Sound section comments regarding it.<br />
<br />
✦Story<br />
So, village girls ends up working at royal family. In sense to prove herself and others. And the anime is about her daily activities as well about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278123">
        other character stories. Adding the whole superb romance element makes this Anime absolutely sweet, cute and fun. Cannot say much without spoiling, but I can say that much that things got a bit more dramatic and dangerous this time around. It had quite some moments and in general I felt story had fine progression, development and as well intrigue. I do not remember S1, but apparently I enjoyed this one a lot. So story&#039;wise, cannot complaint.<br />
<br />
✦Art &amp; Sound<br />
It&#039;s fitting, simple and pretty. Lot of great scenery. Art is quite good, but nothing too amazing. It&#039;s fitting for its style.<br />
<br />
As for sound. There were a lot of noticeable OST and quite satisfying songs. Can&#039;t say much else.<br />
<br />
✦Character<br />
Well, a lot of characters, lot of interesting stereotypes. Some fun backstories and progression. And Shirayuki is adorable with her man. Point being, I did really enjoy the characters in this series. A lot of them intrigued me and even grew onto them. Some villains also their purpose of being hated.<br />
<br />
✦Enjoyment &amp; Overall<br />
Long story short. A very sweet romance Anime with satisfying herbal/rpg theme to it.

    Akagami no Shirayuki Hime   review<br />

    A really good sequel that expands upon the characters in the first show.<br />
<br />
As always, I love the dynamics between Shirayuki and the men in her life. They all fall for her a little, and she ultimately changes the people she meets for the better and builds lasting friendships. <br />
<br />
I enjoyed seeing Raj and Zen grow up in this show. Of course Zen was always nice, but I really feel like in this show he demonstrates the maturity that he needs to be able to keep up with Shirayuki. <br />
<br />
This show is funny in that almost every villain (with the exception of Madame Sea-Snake) ends up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256199">
        being influenced by Zen and Shirayuki and changing their ways. It&#039;s really quite heartwarming. Case in point: Raj. In trying to earn Shirayuki&#039;s respect, he ends up earning the respect of the others around him and learning to be a better prince and person. (His randoms snaps are still hella annoying, though)<br />
<br />
Just a nitpicky thing: with all the time Shirayuki spends around trained soldiers, you&#039;d think one of them could teacher her some self-defense!<br />
<br />
