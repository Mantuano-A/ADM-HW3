    I have to admit to being won over by Kobato before ever seeing the first frame of film.  One look at the artwork for this series and Kobato&#039;s beautiful clothing and settings and I knew this was going to be something for me.  Thankfully I was also rewarded with an enjoyable and heartwarming story.  While Kobato doesn’t exactly break any new ground, it’s a light hearted series that should make anyone smile, with just a touch of drama to keep it interesting.<br />
<br />
Kobato herself begins as a bit of a mystery, tasked with a mission of healing the hearts of others in order

          <span style="display: none;" id="review24935">
        for her to be granted her own wish.  Despite being a hopeless idiot and incurably moe, Kobato does the best she can helping others.  She is guided and protected by Ioryogi, an important figure from the spirit world who appears to Kobato in the form of a stuffed animal.  The reasons for her mission, her origins, and the reason for Ioryogi&#039;s appearance are explained as the story unfolds. <br />
<br />
Most of the plot is going to be fairly predictable to anyone who&#039;s seen many series like this and the early episodes are a bit formulaic.  However this does change as the plot thickens over the last half of the series.  I found the pacing to be good and I never felt that it lingered or stalled for too long in any place for me to get bored with it.  Maybe the only exception would be the first half dozen episodes, with their similar and episodic plotlines.  I was never blown away with any of it despite Kobato&#039;s overwhelming cuteness, but the ending story arc is both heartwarming and heat wrenching.  But I did like the ending overall and felt it wrapped up the series nicely and tied up all the loose ends.<br />
<br />
The main reason to watch Kobato is for the titular character.  She is overbearingly adorable in every way.  Her character design is extremely appealing and she has possibly the best wardrobe I have yet seen in anime.  Kobato could be the poster girl for moe; she’s earnest, innocent, naive, lacking any common sense, and impossibly stupid.  On the surface one would probably think she lacked substance as well.  While you could definitely say this early on, due to the length of the series and the time spent growing and developing her character she eventually becomes a great all around protagonist, instead of just a moe figurehead.<br />
<br />
Kobato&#039;s main foil would be her guardian Ioryogi.  A quick tempered spirit stuck in the form of a stuffed animal, he is constantly berating Kobato for her stupidity and chastising her for not staying on task.  However despite his gruff nature it’s obvious that he really loves and cares about her too.  The relationship between them is the source of a lot of the shows humor, and I found the pair to be quite a delight to watch.<br />
<br />
The other most important character to the story would be the introverted and standoffish Fugimoto.  I am not really a big fan of Fugimoto&#039;s type and always feel this is an overused cliché, particularly in shoujo and romance anime.  I don’t think I will ever understand why girls find this kind of guy to be appealing.  Why would you want to break down the guys emotional barriers and deal with all his baggage when there are plenty of other guys who are actually nice to you?  Someday I hope to understand this mindset.<br />
<br />
The rest of the supporting cast is handled well and for the most part quite interesting.  Sayaka is the most important, as the head of the preschool that Fugimoto and Kobato work.  The great majority of the story takes place at the school and revolves around their efforts to save it from villainous loan sharks.  Sayaka is given some back story and development but most of the remaining cast remains mostly static.  They push the story in the right direction when needed and then fade from view.  This is a good thing since it allows the show to focus on those who deserve the screen time.<br />
<br />
I am not particularly a huge fan of CLAMP artwork and designs.  While their drawings are undoubtedly brilliant and beautiful (particularly when drawing children), I never liked the skinny and malnourished looking characters.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn’t the case in Kobato and the production studio opted for a more normal look.  While everyone is still a bit too thin, they don’t look like they are starving to death.  What really won me over and why I think this is perhaps the most visually appealing work yet was Kobato and her beautiful clothing.  Also, being a CLAMP product you can expect are to see plenty of references and cameos by familiar characters from their other works.  It is nice that at least for the important ones, they don’t seem to reuse the same old models with different names.  This may or may not be a bonus to some fans, but for me it was refreshing.<br />
<br />
The series music, the OP theme and the in between songs are cute and very fitting of the series nature.  In addition the acting is solid all around.  Kobato&#039;s seiyuu is suitably adorable sounding and brings out her personality.  Though it does become a bit grating and overly cute at times, it is a minor annoyance and it probably wouldn’t work as well with a more mature sounding voice.<br />
<br />
Overall I found Kobato to be a rewarding and wonderful viewing experience.  If you like cute and adorable things, CLAMP, light hearted and touching stories with a hint of romance; then Kobato should be high on your list.  If you really dislike moe or need action to be entertained than this is something you should stay away from.  While it may not go down as an all-time classic, Kobato will leave you with a smile.<br />

    Amazing- that&#039;s the one word I would use to describe Kobato.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m rather picky with my ratings, but for the first time in a good while, I decided on a ten.<br />
<br />
Story-9 The plot of Kobato. starts out simple enough- a girl assigned the task of healing peoples&#039; wounded hearts. The first half of the series covers the bases of the overall objective- cases of Kobato doing her work. Even these earlier episodes I though were awesome, but as the series enters its second half, Kobato.&#039;s plot thickens and the series develops into a masterpiece.<br />
<br />
In the first half, we see glimpses of the dark realities of life

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30373">
        beneath the bright, cheerful character of Kobato- and from the very start, Kobato. deals with very real life details; a misunderstanding with a friend, a tragedy with a lover, family problems... <br />
In the second half, however, is revealed a whole new facet of Kobato. The show cuts deeper than a story about a girl with the objective of fulfilling her dream. Debts. Love. Death. Tragedy. Farewells. We see all of these events changing and forming a much more mature Hanato Kobato<br />
<br />
Art-10 I loved the art- I loved it! The details are intricate, the colors and effects wonderfully done. I don&#039;t think I could have asked more of the creators (especially considering this is based off a CLAMP work) except actually letting viewers distinguish the ages of the characters. <br />
<br />
Sound-10 The soundtrack for Kobato. was one of the best I&#039;ve ever heard. My favorite soundtrack up until the point I saw Kobato. was the True Tears Soundtrack, but Kobato. really gave True Tears a run for its money. The sounds vary- cheerful, light, heavy, peaceful... Both soundtracks are masterpieces that fulfill their purpose, supporting and improving the show.<br />
<br />
Character-10 Character. Yes, I&#039;m someone who doesn&#039;t enjoy a book, movie... or anything with shallow characters. At a glimpse, people may think Kobato, is just another &quot;moe&quot;, empty-headed character,  but as the series progresses, all the characters- Fujimoto and Kobato noticeably- grow and mature as they learn important life lessons through their trials. The storyline doesn&#039;t go &quot;easy&quot; on them: the lessons they learn are tough, yes, but also shape and define the characters. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment-10 I both laughed and cried while watching Kobato. It really is a series with contrasting qualities; it brings laughter and tears. It shows the darkness in our society, but also the hope, dreams, and goodness in it. There are trials, but also miracles and second chances. This simple, 24-episode story has all this- and what&#039;s even better is that it has a healing quality, one that warms the heart.  <br />
<br />
Overall-10 Overall, I give Kobato. a ten. I would give an eleven if I could. Kobato. is something viewers of all ages can watch- I would recommend to anyone, anyday. You could watch it with the whole family, your siblings, friends... it&#039;s not something you have to filter or think through. <br />
<br />
All I can say is to give it a try- and let the show do the rest.

    Some­where around about epis­ode 12 it hit me. No, not that the show had sud­denly become watch­able, that wasn’t to hap­pen for sev­eral more epis­odes. No, what hit me was a per­fect way to express what it was I didn’t like about this show. I had some vague review thoughts in my head (sub­con­sciously review­ing the show as you watch it; the curse of being a critic) but most of them revolved around bitch­ing about how stu­pid Kobato her­self was and how the show relied on cute­ness as its main appeal, some­thing I’ve just never really liked. But then it hit me. I read on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27559">
        a blog somewhere that the way the person got through a series they didn’t like was because they spent their time also play­ing Poke­mon. So I finally got around to play­ing Poke­mon Plat­inum after the first few episodes of Kobato (why yes, I am a game behind every­one else) because I real­ised I would prob­ably smash my laptop if I had to sit through another ‘Kobato Gan­bar­rebleargh~’ without some­thing else to occupy my mind. Now nor­mally this shouldn’t work unless I was watch­ing the dub. Mul­ti­task­ing while watch­ing subs is next to impossible. How­ever it did work because I actu­ally under­stood pretty much everything that was being said.<br />
<br />
Let me explain. I have never once made an attempt at learn­ing Japan­ese. I know about as much as any wee­aboo who watches subbed anime would know. Watch­ing Kobato wasn’t a sud­den grand real­isa­tion that I was now flu­ent in Japan­ese. It was the sim­pli­city of the lan­guage the char­ac­ters used. They all had just a few stock lines they would throw out in most situ­ations which meant that after watch­ing a few epis­odes pay­ing atten­tion to the subs you knew pretty much everything that they could say. This effects the anime in far more ways than you might real­ise. Of course you get the pain­fully dull and repet­it­ive dia­logue. Of course there’s the way every scene and every epis­ode feels the exact bloody same with no inspir­a­tion, ingenu­ity or ima­gin­a­tion, bar Kobato’s ward­robe. But along­side that you also have the actual ten­sion in the series solved using the same unin­spired meth­ods in every epis­ode. Kobato throws out a few stock phrases, Ioryogi mut­ters some­thing in the back­ground and all is right with the world once again. It lim­its the dir­ec­tion any epis­ode can take.<br />
<br />
But yes, it does get bet­ter. It may take until around epis­ode 17 before I actu­ally went through an epis­ode without hav­ing beaten 3–4 poke­mon train­ers while it was play­ing, but it cer­tainly did improve. Vastly improved. By epis­ode 20 I had shut that Game Boy for good and was actu­ally watch­ing this show for real. The show took a much more dra­matic and mel­an­cholic tone that suited the style of storytelling far more. After watch­ing the pre­vi­ous 16 epis­odes of failed com­edy (bar Ioryogi dodging cork bul­lets at the fest­ival. That was quite funny) and bland stor­ies that were sup­posed to be heart­warm­ing, the effect this change to a plot-driven story had on the over­all qual­ity of the show was phe­nom­enal. <br />
<br />
Let me talk about the MAL stats for a second on this series. There’s a very high per­cent­age drop rate to com­pleted rate, around 20% of the people who watched it, dropped it. And yet the anime is rated 8.07 at the time of writing, a very respect­able score indeed. MAL doesn’t count the scores once you’ve seen bey­ond a cer­tain num­ber of epis­odes so those who actu­ally sat through the entire thing were clearly rewar­ded for their efforts. It also shows the usual reac­tion of people to rate some­thing highly because the later epis­odes were bet­ter, much like After Story. It’s some­thing that bugs me a lot because I hate hav­ing to sit through sev­eral poor epis­odes just because ‘it gets bet­ter I swear!’. I don’t doubt it does. It’s just those earlier epis­odes are a right pain to sit through. Because Kobato is, for the most part, a poor anime. It just hap­pens to end on a very high note. Plus you can’t skip those earlier epis­odes the same way you the­or­et­ic­ally can for After Story. Without those earlier epis­odes the end­ing ones don’t work.<br />
<br />
It did turn me into a romantic sap though. Good old Clamp did it again. They made me believe that, through any­thing, love will pre­vail. No mat­ter what hap­pens to you, what you go through, what form you’re in, love will get through all that. It did the very same thing Chob­its did. It made me believe in the Power of Love. I came into this anime look­ing for some­thing to rep­lic­ate the feel­ing Chob­its gave me and, in the end, I guess it did exactly that.

    What are you doing with your life?  What are you working for?  What will you accomplish during your time?  How could that time be better served improving that of another?<br />
<br />
All of these are questions you&#039;ll probably be asking yourself while watching &quot;Kobato.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kobato&quot; is one of those rarities that soothes the soul.  It&#039;s hard not to find yourself smiling often, since there are many heartwarming moments throughout.  The show regularly brought tears to the eye--not of sadness, but happiness.  It&#039;s definitely something to consider checking out if you like happier anime, or need something to cheer you up.<br />
<br />
The entire point

          <span style="display: none;" id="review56723">
        of the series can be summarized with one word: empathy.  It shows the heartwarming inspiration and greatness of what happens when someone abandons their own interests for the sake of helping others.  When someone becomes selfless, the avenue is opened up for miraculous outcomes and beautiful changes in peoples&#039; lives.<br />
<br />
A pessimistic philosopher once said that there is no such thing as a truly selfless action, basing their argument on the premise that we&#039;re only doing it because seeing someone in need bothers us--because we ourselves would feel better and be at peace if they were happier.  But what about people for whom this sense of relief is only a side effect?  What about the people who truly don&#039;t care about themselves, and are willing to go above and beyond to lend a hand when someone needs it?  &quot;Kobato&quot; shows how great your life can be when you realize that following your own dreams isn&#039;t the only source of fulfillment.<br />
<br />
I was a little nervous at first becaue of how moe Kobato herself was, but I quickly learned just how great of a character she is.  Her mission is to heal peoples&#039; hearts so her wish can be granted, but it becomes obvious early on that she is far too concerned with the well-being of others to worry about filling the jar for herself.  (Ioryogi constantly observes this and stresses over how she may not complete her task in time to have her wish granted.)  She&#039;ll spend days--or longer--working towards an end, even with the knowledge that it won&#039;t get her any closer to her goal.  She&#039;s great with kids and loves to help out at the local preschool, even though this too doesn&#039;t directly get her any closer to her goal.  She loses sleep worrying about the problems of those around her:  She relentlessly seeks solutions, no matter how poorly she may be treated or how ingrateful the person may be.  She just wants everyone to be happy.<br />
<br />
Kobato teaches us to take pleasure in little things as she carries out every task happily and with a smile--even ones we may not necessarily want to do.  It&#039;s a combination of these things that leads to the creation of what is perhaps the best wife/mother material to ever grace the world of fiction.<br />
<br />
If we had more characters (or better yet, people) like Kobato, the world would be a better place.  It&#039;s disheartening that mindless fan service dolls are more popular than characters that are actually GOOD from shows with actual substance.<br />
<br />
This show has more characterization and character development in a single episode than many anime contain over the span of their entire runtime.  It&#039;s touching to see the characters change after their encounters with Kobato.  The show deals with very real issues people go through and examines the power one person stepping outside of themselves can have, making all the difference in changing a life.  Even the most stone-hearted aren&#039;t safe from her outgoing and caring nature: no wound can&#039;t be healed with the proper care.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kobato&quot; has a pretty good idea of when it&#039;s time to stop with the comedic content when things are getting serious, which is really important in a dramedy.  Once misplaced line can completely butcher the mood of a scene; &quot;Kobato&quot; knows what&#039;s appropriate and when, but is quick to throw in a crack once the storm has passed and the happy status quo has been restored, helping complete a smooth transition and elevating the viewer&#039;s spirits.<br />
<br />
...I guess I gotta talk about art &#039;n&#039; sound &#039;n&#039; stuff, too.  Character design is great; there are some pretty unique ones, the most unique and appealing being Kobato.  Hair movement seems to have been given a particular attention, particularly in the case of it bouncing up and down and someone runs or as the wind blows through it--again, the most attention was given to Kobato.  There is some pretty great imagery, like petals, or leaves falling from trees, or snow, and the surrounding greenary is always a pleasure.  Warmer, brighter, and more vibrant colors are what dominate the visible spectrum, complementing the overall tone of the series.<br />
<br />
Voice acting quality is excellent, with Hana Kanazawa completely bringing the show to life with her peppy, happy, excited Kobato.  Hearing her sing was an extra special treat.  The soundtrack contains some beautiful pieces--particularly those played during more dramatic or emotionally riveting scenes, although there are a number of more upbeat ones for the laid back/comedic scenes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kobato&quot; made me put my hands together and clap like an idiot because it made me so happy.  The show renewed my faith in humanity; it gave me hope that there may still be good people out there with actual morals who care about their fellow man.  It&#039;s wholesome, pure, innocent, and clean--all endangered, unappreciated, underrated qualities in this day and age.  It made me take a step back and reexamine how I was living, and radically altered my outlook on life in general.<br />
<br />
So...  How might &quot;Kobato&quot; touch YOU?

    Kobato is a girl of currently unknown origins whose job is to &quot;heal&quot; the hearts of the world around her. Every time she heals a heart, a candy-like gem called Confetto will appear in a glass bottle in which she carries around. When this glass bottle finally fills up, she will get her wish granted. Thus, the story of Kobato follows her attempts to find people to heal.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
Oh boy... Where do I even begin. The whole storyline has been put out so slowly I&#039;ve lost interest. Even as a major fan of slice of life and non-related episodic anime (in which my favourites include Hidamari

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21041">
        Sketch and Aria, as well as being a fan of Sketchbook and GA), this doesn&#039;t draw me in in any way possible.<br />
<br />
EDIT: 6 episodes after I originally wrote this, I&#039;d say it jsut got worse. they made a highly pointless time skip, in which we end upa few months later, with NO advancement to the storyline, and she just goes on continuing to collect Confetto.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
For some plus points, I&#039;ve always been a fan of the animation Madhouse does, and this is no exception.<br />
<br />
Music<br />
Music is decent, except when Kobato sings. It&#039;s too darn fake-sounding.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
Boy oh boy number 2...<br />
<br />
The anime appears to have 3 main characters. Starting with Fujimoto, the guy appears to be an absolute jerk, but &quot;becomes nicer&quot; after meeting up with Kobato. Appears to have some issues that he helps Kobato find an owner for a stray cat after telling his college classmates he doesn&#039;t want to help them isn&#039;t very convincing. Secondly, Kobato&#039;s character is highly annoying. Her naivety is beyond that of even a child, or maybe the word should be stupidity? Or bimbotic? Either way, this is the first time I did not like a Kana Hanazawa character. The third main in Ioryogi is possibly the most likeable of the trio. That said, the bossy, fire breathing stuff animal is no Mokona or Keroberos, and pretty much insults the great &quot;stuff animals&quot; that we have seen by CLAMP thus far.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
While fire breathing, klutzy antics can be enjoyable once in a while, seeing every episode REALLY gets old, and poor characters and a lack of the heart warming feeling from a slice of life anime really kills off the enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime has gone is a very poor direction. If I was new to the slice of life genre, watching this will make me want to permanantly avoid it. I had such high hopes for Kobato. Poor CLAMP production, poor Madhouse production. Disappointing.

    Wow. After watching the whole series, it&#039;s amazing. Kobato is so lovable as well as many other characters.<br />
<br />
Kobato, as you know, is by CLAMP, so there are lots of similarities overall, as well as some characters. The artwork  is amazing with the nice colors and the touch that makes certain characters lovely or not. The songs played in the background  as well as songs that Kobato herself sings were all perfect for the anime.<br />
<br />
The story itself had times where it dragged on imo, but in the last few episodes, they were wrapped up so perfectly, and the final episode is one that I&#039;d

          <span style="display: none;" id="review24595">
        consider the best ending I&#039;ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed watching Kobato for lulz as well as just experiencing the adorableness. It&#039;s an anime I&#039;d highly recommend to pretty much anyone.

    I&#039;m not someone who can&#039;t live without shoujo.  In fact, I usually hate everything of the genre with a passion.  Kobato. seemed like a happy exception to the rule, but after a few episodes, it became apparent that old habits die hard for me (or rather &quot;shoujo sucks&quot; is still upheld).<br />
<br />
<br />
==[Pros]==<br />
<br />
- Visuals.  Like most CLAMP works, Kobato. has great character designs and is an artistic triumph.  I usually hate chibi, but the chibi here is well-placed, albeit done a bit frequently.<br />
<br />
- Kobato.  She is a great character, reminiscent of Yotsuba in her curiosity and innocence.  Her easily earned smile

          <span style="display: none;" id="review20671">
        and ability to talk straightforwardly are traits that give off a childlike feel and ultimately make for an intriguing main character and an equally interesting plot.<br />
<br />
- All of the mysteries.  Why exactly is Kobato here?  What is she?  Does she even change clothes?  Great questions... if left unanswered.<br />
<br />
<br />
==[Cons]==<br />
<br />
- The mysteries look like they&#039;re going to be solved.  Ioryogi meets figures from his past and Kobato is mentioned more than once in his speech.  I don&#039;t want the show to focus on the mysteries surrounding Kobato.  All I want to see is an innocent girl interacting with the world around her.  Is that too much to ask?<br />
<br />
- Non-episodic nature.  The early episodes are slice-of-life and run smoothly, but when Kobato gets hired, the show gets bogged down.  Add to this an overall story, and the original slice-of-life qualities that I found impressive in Kobato. have all but vanished.<br />
<br />
- Focus becomes Kobato&#039;s airhead qualities instead of her innocence and naivety.  I want to see the world through Kobato&#039;s eyes.  I don&#039;t want to see Kobato&#039;s eyes flat on the floor.<br />
<br />
- Ioryogi is (as of ep. 6) in the show for comic relief and as a gateway into Kobato&#039;s background.  Both of these purposes aren&#039;t exactly beneficial: fire breathing and sudden outbursts become old by episode two and learning Kobato&#039;s background answers questions that don&#039;t need to be answered.<br />
<br />
- Fujimoto sucks.  I hate him.  Nothing about his character is even remotely appealing.<br />
<br />
<br />
==[Conclusion]==<br />
Great start for a shoujo, but ends up shifting direction from an interesting story about an innocent girl to a boring story about a bumbling fool and her mascot&#039;s uninteresting past.

    NOTE: the first paragraph is for those who are looking for motivation to watch this series, if not skip to the next.     <br />
<br />
 If you&#039;re tired or bored watching same anime storyline over and over again and looking for something different, then I&#039;m sure watching Kobato would not impress even a single cell in your brain, well at first. It&#039;s storyline is a typical shoujo, as you might be expecting, with a witty, innocent, naive etc. main character ,that you might have seen a thousand times already, living her life sharing/showing her naivety/innocence to others day by day. But even though

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29075">
        you feel like ditching this series after reading this, I would like you to sit tight and relax for a bit, for me giving a 9 overall score isn&#039;t a mistake.<br />
<br />
Kobato is a lighthearted series that has a nice blend of drama, comedy, a bit of fantasy, a bit of slice of life, and a happy romantic ending.<br />
<br />
Hanato Kobato, the childish, naive and sweet main character, is on a mission to fulfill her wish, to go somewhere and in order to accomplish it she need to fill a flask with each person she heals.  She resides in a park with a spirit named Ioryogi with a body of small blue stuffed dog. Ioryogi acts as a strict proctor to Kobato and he often shouts at her or bathes her with fire when she makes mistakes. Uninteresting? maybe, maybe not.<br />
<br />
Well the story started to slowly revolve upon her arrival at a Nursery after following Fujimoto. The first episodes were mostly episodic, her meeting with different people and eventually healing their problems and filling up her flask in the process. At this moment we might have give up all our hopes and ditch this series(like me) but as it goes the stories goes deeper and deeper as more and more mysteries were revealed and slowly the characters develop. This is where the story gets interesting and eventually captivating you to the series.<br />
<br />
Its pacing is what made this series beautiful. It carried the series from being a mediocre to unforgettable. Even though the storyline carries some inevitable cons such as &quot;non-sense&#039;&#039; and &quot;idiotic&quot; scenes it manages to bring out even a tiny droplet of meaningful things from it and adding it up to the grand climax later on.<br />
<br />
The art was the greatest asset of the series. I&#039;m not a fan of CLAMP art and I dislike their skinny character design and I&#039;m so glad they did a very good job here. Kobato is one of the few characters that I&#039;ve seen with a change of outfit, and very cute. The characters&#039; faces and hair are very beautiful, specially for Kobato and the kids. The background art was also marvelous and it perfectly blends with the characters.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know whether to praise the STs or not, I&#039;m really confused b/c the STs blended extraordinarily in each scene, adding depth to the emotion, to the point that I can&#039;t  remember any melody at all. The OP was astounding. It has a bright and slightly playful melody w/c brings up the character of Kobato.<br />
<br />
Some of the cast are design rip-offs from previous CLAMP animes (such as Chobits) and some did have a cameo appearance. The main characters were shrouded in some sort of mystery, specially Kobato. Most of those were revealed in perfect timing but others were just left there hanging in the clouds, such as the Spirits and this &quot;war&quot; they had w/ the &quot;heaven&quot;. Yet characters are not without flaws. I&#039;ll particularly discuss Fujimoto. For me his developments as a character are shown poorly, or rather was not developed enough, he hardly shown any development and it made him look like a &quot;developed&quot; character from the beginning, which is not a very nice asset of a character. Well all I wanted to say is that he has a slow gradual development and a spike on the end, maybe some may like it or maybe most, but I don&#039;t.<br />
<br />
In the beginning I was bought out  by its high rating( I usually pick my anime to watch this way) but then I find it boring in the first 10 min. of the first episode and decided to ditch it(that&#039;s how picky I am) but for the sake of my &quot;wasted&quot; HDD space I decided to rerun it and I&#039;m very glad that I did.<br />
<br />
In the end of the day I find myself crying on the 23rd episode and had a bittersweet smile at the 24th. I&#039;m not someone to cry on any drama so it really surprised me how I was so frustrated to Fujimoto, he was a jerk. LOL.<br />
<br />
Anyways the series was unforgettable. I really enjoyed watching it and its truly worthwhile. Kobato reminded me that somewhere, maybe, on this world there is this one idiot person that follows you around, annoys you. You might end up hurting that person but still that person will always be by your side, no matter what and someday you&#039;ll realize how important it is ...to have an idiot person beside you...<br />
<br />
By the way, this will be my first review and I don&#039;t know whether my style of writing would fit for a review. They always told that my writing was dreamy and I have no hope writing bookish statements. So if you find my review so disturbing or something, please send me a message, it would really help me. And for grammatical errors, sorry I was refraining from using a lot of metaphors.<br />

    Kobato is a show I really struggled to find raw enjoyment in.  It may be part in fact that I am normally a fan of silly lighthearted romance comedies and the occasional shonen anime.  Suffice to say that this would be one reason to avoid this show.  If you&#039;re looking for something flashy that will grab your attention immediately, this show is worth removing from your &quot;Plan to Watch&quot; list.<br />
<br />
However ultimately I did decide to watch this show to completion since I am open to trying new things.<br />
<br />
The story is fairly down to earth, once you look past the obvious fact that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review24459">
        Kobato and Ioryogi are obviously not normal beings. The show starts very slowly, playing itself out episodically as Kobato interacts with other people on different days of the seasons to heal them of their misfortunes and collect &quot;candy&quot; in the process. That by itself is fairly repetitive, and little is done to really explain in detail who exactly the main characters are. Aside from the occasional gag where Kobato&#039;s clumsiness gets the better of her (and Ioryogi&#039;s temper), it&#039;s hard to find anything that really stands out in this show, as plot and character development happens very slowly. I probably sympathize with Ioryogi&#039;s complaints about &#039;Dobato&#039; in general not getting stuff done efficiently.<br />
<br />
The art is at least pretty good.  Characters and special effects have been drawn with pretty good detail, so the show at least won&#039;t make you want to tear your eyes out. The music isn&#039;t very special, aside from Kobato&#039;s song, and the first ED for this show is painfully uninteresting with an unremarkable song and a redundant animation of Kobato&#039;s candy bottle slowly rotating.<br />
<br />
The story does try to pick itself up towards the end, explaining some of Fujimoto and Sayaka&#039;s background and how it relates to Yomogi nursery, and even closer towards the end there is some attempt to try to explain why Kobato is significant to this in the first place. The show becomes a bit of a confusing mess when there is some indirect attempts to hint around the backgrounds of the characters from other worlds and there is a good number of poorly explained ends.<br />
<br />
Is this show what people would classify as of the shoujo genre? Maybe that genre is not meant for me.  I&#039;d like someone to tell me otherwise if there are perhaps better shows like this one. It&#039;s not like I find this show is outright horrible.  While there are some humorous and tender moments, there really just isn&#039;t enough that happens over the course of 24 episodes. It&#039;s just a very slow show in general with a fairly uncomplicated plot that has few twists to really spark interest.  Overall I really wouldn&#039;t recommend wasting ~12 hours on this show.  I don&#039;t find this show good enough in anything to counterbalance how slow this show is. The characters aren&#039;t developed well enough for the most part, the story isn&#039;t really wholly amazing, and there isn&#039;t really much implementation of anything that will grab your attention like action scenes.

    Every single person you&#039;ve meet in your life hasn&#039;t felt perfect in every single moment of his/her life. It&#039;s nothing but normal to feel pain in certain situations. But there are people who suffer a little more than others. <br />
In this anime, a mysterious girl appears with a mission. She has to heal hearts which are in pain, in other words, wounded hearts. If she completes her mission, her wish will come true. The story has very happy and very sad moments. It succeeds in making you smile without being stupid and succeeds in making you sad without being pathetic and boring. I would say

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57551">
        that the story is pretty good, it had potential and used it. There is background story for almost everything that happens, and behind almost every character. The final form was done well. It may be deeper than it seems. Only thing I don&#039;t like is that there are few &#039;holes&#039; in it. I mean, some thing aren&#039;t explained very well in the end, so:<br />
Story: 9<br />
<br />
While trying to complete her mission, she meets many people with interesting stories. All those persons have completed, interesting, touching and pretty realistic stories. I liked that you can laugh and cry with those characters. Also, I must mention that the characters develop through the story. You can notice how they learn more about themselves, experience all sorts of feelings and realize them. I would say they get more &#039;mature&#039; in self-knowledge with the pass of time.<br />
Kobato is kind and nice girl. In the beginning it seems that she helps other people only because of her selfish wishes, but later we see that she really likes to help others, which makes her a great person. Fujimoto at first seems like self-centered and cold person, but he really isn&#039;t like that. We can watch him getting softer and softer as the time passes. And Ioryogi is a lot more than a stuffed animal.<br />
Characters: 10<br />
<br />
The drawing looks simply beautiful. The thing I liked the most were eyes (and the whole face). The characters look pretty realistic. Also, their body parts are proportional, which is good. The clothes were fantastically drawn, and I liked that they aren&#039;t wearing the same clothes all the time. Their moves are done pretty good too. Animation was correct, no mistakes, and was especially good in some episodes.<br />
Art: 10<br />
<br />
The music was done well. The songs were different one from each other. They were perfectly suitable for the &#039;mood&#039; of the moments. Here, we had both sad and happy sounds. The voice acting was pretty fine, without special mistakes. I would like more emotions in few moments, but that&#039;s only my personal impression. Voices fit good in characters. I loved second ending. <br />
Sound: 9<br />
<br />
This anime has many parts different in mood. In one moment it makes you laugh, in second it makes you worry, in third you cry. It gets both happy and sad, dramatic, and in few moments romantic. It surely will make you enjoy. The only thing I didn&#039;t like is that there were few funny scenes based on the same situation, so:<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
This show is a good choice if you want to watch something relaxing, but not without a story. Also, it can easily change your mood, so, if you want to get in the story, it&#039;s a good idea to watch this. This is an anime you don&#039;t just watch, you feel it.<br />
<br />
Quote for the end:<br />
&quot;Is there anyone who needs healing here?!&quot;<br />
<br />

    Before I watched Kobato, I had yet to find an anime that made me emotional. I had NEVER cried before while watching an anime, and I did watch some pretty sad/deep ones.<br />
<br />
When I saw the DVD cover, I was a bit hesitant. I couldn&#039;t help but think that it would be another one of those pointless happy-go-lucky friendship-is-the-best animes. But. The opening started playing and by the end of the first episode my eyes were glued to the computer screen. I <br />
I literally fell in love with Kobato&#039;s guardian/mascot/stuffed animal Ioriyogi! The art was amazing and I adored Kobato&#039;s cute, frilly outfits (why don&#039;t I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34624">
        have clothes like that sobsob).<br />
 <br />
☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆<br />
<br />
The sound was of an outstanding quality and I just realized I never really thought about the quality of it because it was THAT EPIC!<br />
<br />
☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆<br />
<br />
I was watching the last episode at 2 a.m (wow! early, much?) and I let me tell you, my pyjamas were SOAKED and I cried for about half an hour! I woke up my whole family! The episode was so sad but at the same time so happy... Kobato is such a sweetie and Fujimoto is kinda stubborn and likes to lash out at people  but that adds to his moe-ness !!!!(*is a masochist*)<br />
<br />
☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆<br />
<br />
I recommend this series to anyone who is sad and wants something to cheer them up, or just wants a good cry. I also recommend it to people who have pretty much watched every good anime known to otaku and can&#039;t find an anime without ninja turds and anything to do with souls being taken. Actually, scratch that. <br />
<br />
I recommend Kobato to EVERYONE!<br />

    I actually enjoyed this anime so much.  I originally started watching it because I was after a time passer but Kobato turned out to be so much more. The whole anime was such a mood lifter and can be best described as soft and fluffy. <br />
<br />
The story follows a girl, Kobato, who has been sent to Earth to heal people&#039;s hearts. She has 4 seasons of the weather to fill up a jar with the &#039;konpeito&#039;, what the bottled heart fragments are referred to. Her guide is Iorogi, a being taking the form of a stuffed animal. Kobato falls in love with a nursery

          <span style="display: none;" id="review115237">
        she begins to work at and the story follows from there.<br />
<br />
Story 8/10 - I admit that the last few episodes aren&#039;t what I expected. It turned out to be one of those &#039;fate&#039; animes. Up until the last episode the story was perfect. There were occasional fillers but they were funny and cute so I didn&#039;t mind. The anime was well paced, never did I think,  &#039;did I miss something?&#039;. Even though the ending wasn&#039;t perfect,  it had its own charms because it showed what happened to everyone as time passed and I couldn&#039;t spot any holes in the plot. It ran really smoothly. Though,  I didn&#039;t like that they kept us guessing Kobato&#039;s past until the very end.<br />
<br />
Animation &amp; music 8/10 - The art was beautiful. I didn&#039;t like how the hair was done for some characters but the art was so crisp and pretty. The change of clothing was also something which I liked, especially Kobato&#039;s. <br />
The music was soft and refreshing. I truly did enjoy the songs which were used, even though they were repetitive. The OP and ED suited the anime very well.<br />
<br />
Characters 9/10 - The characters were so deep. That&#039;s what I loved. Everyone had a back story, even if it wasn&#039;t explained very well. Their personalities were done very well. Kobato was truly the most gorgeous character and it was very hard not to love her. All the other characters were likeable too.<br />
<br />
Overall, 8/10, I really enjoyed this anime and look forward to re watching it sometime in the future.

    After finishing watching Kobato only today, I was compelled to write my first review ever for this wonderful anime, Kobato.<br />
<br />
Where to start? <br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
<br />
I definitely thought the story was well thought out. Some could argue that there were a lot of &quot;fillers&quot;, but I disagree. The episodes that seemingly contributed no development to the plot let the watcher get a better feel on each of the characters&#039; background stories and personalities, especially Kobato and Fujimoto&#039;s. Kobato&#039;s background story, not so much, but definitely her personality.<br />
<br />
The last 7 or so episodes really started picking up the pace and started climbing towards the climax. Again, the story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review24296">
        was well-thought out. I am definitely the type of anime-watcher who would ditch a series after watching the first few episodes if I wasn&#039;t interested, and in fact, I did put Kobato on hold after the first 10 episodes, but I&#039;m so glad that I decided to watch again a few days ago. I would&#039;ve never thought that this anime could develop so much and bring so much meaning to life (dramatic, I know!) in a mere 24 episodes.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
<br />
Many agree that the art in Kobato is just refreshing, modern, and amazing--and so do I! Unlike some anime, the &quot;profile&quot; shots of the characters were never distorted and they always looked great. You could definitely tell the animators weren&#039;t being lazy! The art is beautiful, beautiful, so beautiful. One quirky thing I just noticed (and liked!) about the art was Kobato&#039;s way of dressing. I&#039;ve watched and read most of Clamp&#039;s work, and it seemed like they took bits of Cardcaptor Sakura (with the costumes) and Tsubasa Chronicles (her body-shape and long dresses) and combined those styles into Kobato&#039;s dresses full of simple colors and great design that show that Kobato is unique, cute, beautiful, innocent... the list goes on.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
<br />
I admit, I don&#039;t pay much attention to the soundtrack of an anime unless it&#039;s for fighting scenes, the climax, or the music&#039;s just really loud. Kobato&#039;s songs are beautiful and so fitting for this cute but emotional anime. As for the soundtrack, it definitely fit the anime and the mood of it with a simple piano background at times or the tinkling of bells. The seiyuus (voice actors) did a good job with their characters. The characters&#039; voices were realistic and true to the character. Kobato&#039;s voice took a little while to get used to since it was so high-pitched and I could HEAR the smile in her voice. Scary, I know. But it was great :) I loved loryogi&#039;s voice the most.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
<br />
As I said in the &quot;Story&quot; section of my review, there were some &quot;fillers&quot; but they helped with the characterization of Kobato, Mrs. Sayaka, and Fujimoto mostly. Kobato&#039;s background is pretty hazy and vague most of the 26 episodes, but near the end you find out so much information, but it&#039;s not overwhelming. You just need to be patient. As for Mrs. Sayaka and Fujimoto, their backgrounds are pretty well explained throughout the series in every other episode or so, so there is no suspenseful wait for the details on those two. <br />
<br />
What I didn&#039;t like about the characterization in Kobato. is loryogi&#039;s background and his friends (Ginsei, etc). I just felt that CLAMP didn&#039;t do enough to describe their pasts in detail, only dropping some vague information here and there. I was pretty confused about their backgrounds throughout the anime and I was dying to know more about them, almost as much as I wanted to know about Kobato&#039;s past and who she really is. Spoilers aren&#039;t allowed in reviews, but all I can say is that I feel pretty disappointed about loryogi and the lack of information on him.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
<br />
I had to be patient with this anime. I&#039;m the type with a very short attention span who never likes to commit to anything, pretty much. But I did come back to this anime after a one month break and I enjoyed it IMMENSELY. The first 15 episodes or so are cute and sweet, but as I recall, didn&#039;t really contribute to the plot that much. <br />
<br />
The beginning episodes talked about the history of Yomogi Nursery and Mrs. Sayaka, Fujimoto, and some other minor characters and how Kobato settled into Earth. I soon lost interest after watching for a bit. But I&#039;m very glad I finished watching Kobato to the end. After the first half of the series, &quot;action&quot; started picking up and I was hooked to the very end, where I got all emotional and sniffled a bit. I enjoyed Kobato so so much, I just wish that the beginning half had more to offer, especially about loryogi and his friends.<br />
<br />
Like in most of CLAMP&#039;s work, they &quot;recycled&quot; their characters. Some characters from their other works like Tsubasa Chronicles and Cardcaptor Sakura appeared in Kobato, though they had very minor roles. That was enjoyable XD<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
<br />
I was definitely tempted to make the overall a &quot;10&quot; but I knew that the anime did have a minor cons. I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who likes Cardcaptor Sakura-type anime, but you need to be prepared for less action, but more kawaii-ness :) Also, anyone who is stressed and just needs a break to watch a cute, fun-filled (not the Lucky Star-type, though!), and emotional anime whose main key points are making other people happy and enjoying it. This anime is definitely centered around happiness and made me very happy too. After reading all the comments each episode got on the internet, everyone felt happy too. CLAMP really captured my heart with this anime. I&#039;ll definitely consider reading the manga. :D<br />

    Story: A thorough and intense story. Watching it with concentration gives you the essence of how excellently the story unfolds. The small things in life are depicted wonderfully in these 24 episodes. Emotions have been handled with great care to give the appropriate impact in each episode. [10/10] <br />
<br />
Art: The Original Art by Mangaka CLAMP are always beautifully drawn. (They are the best illustrators among Mangaka really -only my personal opinion ofcourse.)  The Art in the series too is excellent. Kobato&#039;s innocence, Sayaka Sensei&#039;s kindness, Kiyokazu&#039;s attitude, all show up nicely from the way they have been drawn. Loryogi-san is comical. The background landscape

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37723">
        is not much so that focus is kept more on the characters- again a benifit in terms of the impact that the characters and their behavior can have on the viewer. [10/10]<br />
<br />
Sound: Music by Takeshi Hama is melodious. An Ancient Story is my personal favourite. Ashita Kuru Hi (sung by Kobato in the series at 2-3 occasions) is another melody which slowly begins to resonate after a few episodes. Hotaru no Mori is another beautiful tune with bells. Most music pieces are played on Violins, Viola, Cello, Piano. The music again adds to the atomosphere creation in each episode. [10/10]<br />
<br />
Characters: Kobato&#039;s innocence is 100% believable. There are also some times in episodes when one suddenly realises that though she is all bubbly all the time, there is a hint of sadness somewhere behind that smile. Sayaka Sensei&#039;s kindness is too much but still that character is very much believable. Kiyokazu is shown to have a bit of attitude but he&#039;s a really caring person inside. Doumoto is simply a guy any girl would love to fall in love. Loryogi-san is really comical. But he too cares for Kobato throughout the series and indirectly guides her to good things. [10/10]<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: If you like watching Slice of life genre anime then Kobato is THE anime to watch. Day to day experiences that Kobato has have varied emotions. And in many ways Kobato herself heals many peoples troubled hearts unknowingly. [10/10]<br />
<br />
Overall: It was an overwhemling experience for me to see a story that was so perfectly woven to express emotions felt by a person in everyday life. Emotions though unfolded one by one have a rather intense impact on the viewer many a times. (especially episode 13- you just have to watch it to understand how subtly you get attached to Kobato&#039;s innocence and how she feels about things) The art of the manga as well as the series was a visual treat (as is always the case for me when i read any CLAMP manga). Music is very melodious and aptly builds up the atmosphere in each episode. Comical situations in the story are well positioned. What more can i say just go ahead and start watching and you&#039;ll know what magic CLAMP stories cast on you :)

    Ah Kobato...<br />
<br />
If you look at my anime list, you will notice that Im very picky when it comes to rating. And seldomly do I ever give away a full 10 points. The only anime so far on my list that has gotten a full 10 points is Clannad. I praised it holy and as a milestone in my anime watching career.<br />
<br />
And now! The time has come to gift a new wonderfull anime 10 points, and oh shall we prais its presence next to Clannad at the top of my ranking.<br />
<br />
This anime... I rated it as a 10 - Masterpiece because if there is one word

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26167">
        id choose to describe it, it would be: Beatiful.<br />
<br />
Its perfectly balanced story wise and very enjoyable to watch. The characters are all lovable and unique. Everything about this anime, from the story to the music is just plain beatiful.<br />
One thing I realy love is the art. A big plus point is the way the faces are drawn, they are somewhat unique and new, but very nice to look at. You will probaly fall in love with this style after the first episode. And Kobato&#039;s dresses are also very adorable to look at.<br />
The story is very flat and easy to follow, alltho this anime will surley make you heart soft and bring forward a couple tears, its overall enjoyment is outstanding. You laugh, you cry, and then you cry again because it makes you so happy. Clannad had thies elements, but compared to Clannad, Kobato is easier to watch and lighter hearted.<br />
<br />
Now there is something I want to share with all of you. I am a big fan of Chobits, a former anime also made by Clamp. And when you watch this anime and you are familiar with Chobits, you will notice some things that will realy give you a pleasent supprise content wise. Im going to list thies little easter eggs here because they realy made my heart go &quot;awww isnt this awsome&quot;.<br />
<br />
- The resedent that Kaboto stays at, is the exact same one from chobits, the twin sisters are the Chobit sisters (chi and her sister) and the resedent owner is the wife of the creater of the chobit series, who is also the mother to them.<br />
<br />
- The bakery that Kaboto works at every once in a while is named &quot;Tirol&quot; and the shop owner and his assistant are the same ones out of Chobits.<br />
<br />
I think there was 1 or 2 more but I cant think of them atm. But basicly thies characters out of the Chobits anime are in Kaboto&#039;s world in a Human state, basicly like everything should have been. At least thats my impression and gave this anime an extra flavor that I truly loved.<br />
<br />
Its hard to put all the emotions and beaty of this anime in to words, im not even going to try very hard because I dont want to screw anything up and leave a odd impression.<br />
<br />
So to all you comedy, drama, romance genre fans out there! Kobato is defently a MUST WATCH anime. And when you watch it, I hope you love it as much as I do. It defently earned thos 10 points.

    Let me start with saying this :<br />
I doubt a REVIEW is written when the anime doesn&#039;t even have 8 episodes released, but that&#039;s what i saw here, and it kinda pissed me off.I&#039;m not denying anyone&#039;s opinion , but they should at least be kept AFTER the anime ended ,but since we are almost halfway through , i shall make a small review myself [ must note that the review might/might not change after the anime ended]<br />
<br />
Story: Everyone is crying on how there is no plot. I actually see it very well , but the climax hasn&#039;t been reached cause even the manga is on-going

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21623">
        , but the plot is definitely there. But , if you are expecting an I-didn&#039;t-expect-that-to-happen-omg plot , Kobato ain&#039;t the thing for you , especially not if you were expecting something groundshaking [ this ain&#039;t no death note or stuff like that] It&#039;s boundaries remain at a shojo-slice of life-magic anime  ,but I am sure that since CLAMP did it , the story will definitely have some unexpected turns. I trully believe that.So story deserves 9 on my point.<br />
<br />
Art : Art is flawless and i doubt anyone would disagree.If anyone should disagree on the beautiful art provided by CLAMP and MADHouse , then i will only say to them : you don&#039;t like cute...then why are you even watching this  ? cause it says clearly shojo-magic etc  The art is very cute , beautiful and to top it off good . What has MADHouse on the list surely will be good art.Art gets 10.<br />
<br />
Sound: I like the OST . I&#039;ve been humming &#039;Magic Number&#039; for weeks now.Maaya Sakamoto pwns.<br />
<br />
Character: Cute characters , not flat at all. Kobato is absolute cuteness , Yoryogi absolute funnieness.......Fujimoto , the bishie of the series...doubt any girl has to complain about him , since i will say this : he IS developing as a character and personality nicely , just like Kobato .So gets a 9.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: The anime makes you feel all sweet inside .Gives you a nice , friendly ,entertaining feeling.The kind of feeling that makes you wanna say &#039; I want to see more&#039; . At least , that&#039;s how it is for me .I believe the series to be one of the best this year for me.Until now , I have obviously enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
That is why I say it again : if you are looking for something groundshaking, OMFG-ish and stuff like that.If you hate pink and sweet stuff...don&#039;t watch this .In fact , if you are not a shojo-fantasy-CLAMP fan, don&#039;t watch it. Do not misunderstand,Kobato isn&#039;t mushy , it&#039;s just....cotton candy sweet .

    Cardcaptor Sakura, even when I didn&#039;t know back then, was the first touch I had with CLAMP. After being somehow disappointed by Chobits, I decided to start Kobato. Here&#039;s my review of this anime that will warm you heart. <br />
<br />
Story : 9/10 <br />
<br />
The story of Kobato is pretty simple. We don&#039;t know much at first, but it seems that Kobato has to heal broken hearts to realize her wish. Broken hearts, as we and Kobato understand, can be hard to understand and especially to heal. The first 5-6 episodes are completely devoted to this understanding of how the &#039;konpeito&#039; works. I will tell more about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review140075">
        the story on the characters review. <br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
<br />
This was my biggest fear, as what really turned me off on Chobits was the art, which didn&#039;t please me. Kobato was a complete opposite. Characters are overly cute, of course, so you should be aware of that. Hair that almost touches the ground, clothes that are almost surreal, Kobato can&#039;t really be considered as a normal japanese girl, but that&#039;s because she is not. The art is really, really good and the scenery is amazing. <br />
<br />
Sound : 8/10<br />
<br />
The voice of Kobato is really, really nice. She has this kind of way to sing that really warms you up. However, she only sings one song in the entire anime, which is a bit disappointing. The song is really cute, really well written and representative of the anime. Overall, you can&#039;t really say that the sound was bad on Kobato, it was just non-diversified. <br />
<br />
Character : 10/10<br />
<br />
This is where the good part comes. For the first 5-6 episodes, you might be disappointed and think that this is what the entire anime will be : an episodical anime following the type of Natsume Yuujinchu or even Jigoku Shoujo, where the main character pretty much stays the same all over the anime. However, when Kobato reaches to her kindergarten school, all of this goes away. The character development is amazing. Kobato really grows and learns and it&#039;s so nice to see her understand, to feel her joy and sadness, to watch her realize how much this world has to offer. She really is an amazing character and in her own way she also changes everyone she meets. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 10/10<br />
<br />
I&#039;m having goosebumps as I&#039;m typing this review. Kobato really touched me and I would recommend it to anyone who&#039;s looking for a really soft anime, but well written and really, really full of surprises. The ending of the anime will not disappoint you, that I can assure. <br />
<br />
Overall : 10/10<br />
<br />
Kobato is the second anime to deserve a 10 from my part. This anime was pure gold. I learned to love Kobato and her naivety, but also wanted to protect her and see her understand the world she lived in, and she did. It was such a joy to see her grow so much and to watch her heal people, live and laugh, to see her change the people she met and to see them slowly starting to love her, to miss her. You can&#039;t skip Kobato, because it really is worth it.

    Kobato! Ganbarimasu!<br />
<br />
Kobato. The show that I watched for some comedic relief, only to end up crying like an absolute bitch. It&#039;s also one of the few adaptations that I&#039;ve heard has surpassed its mango form. I don&#039;t read mangoes, so I wouldn&#039;t know, but that didn&#039;t stop me from shedding a shit ton of tears.<br />
<br />
The easiest way to know if you will like this show is to watch the first few episodes and ask yourself this: Do you think Kobato is the most adorable thing ever to exist? If you answered yes, like I did, you will absolutely love this show. If you by some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217307">
        weird reason find her abnormally annoying and a cringe-producing machine, then don&#039;t even bother watching!<br />
<br />
Kobato takes the themes of a low IQ deredere and the meaning of happiness and fucks your feelings with tons of moe and melodrama. Do not take Kobato&#039;s bubbly exterior lightly, for this show knows how to conduct the feels train as well as Vino can. You may think that Kobato&#039;s cheer is too overwhelming to bear, but this actually gives her emotions a lot of contrast, for when she&#039;s sad, you&#039;ll be crying alongside her as well.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
- KOBATO IS SO CUTE!!<br />
- Isn&#039;t just a one character show. The other characters have a lot of personality and even have great backstories!<br />
- Great exploration of its themes, like the impact of heartbreak and how important happiness is in one&#039;s life.<br />
- Beautiful art and animation.<br />
- Beautiful OST.<br />
- Incredibly heart touching ending. <br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- I shall quote part of the synopsis on MAL: &quot;However, she is not allowed to fall in love with anyone whose heart she heals.&quot; Is this explored or even mentioned at all in the show? Nah not really.<br />
- Kobato isn&#039;t going to be loved by everyone. Some people find her annoying.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
The everyday adventures of Dobato and her angry as fuck stuffed animal. Their goal is to collect confetti, which they earn by healing the hearts of the broken hearted. Pretty simple premise, with slapstick humor and a lot of melancholy. That&#039;s how I would describe the show if I was forced to do it as simply as possible.<br />
<br />
But Kobato is way more than that. Kobato is a perfect example of &quot;It&#039;s all about the journey, not the destination.&quot; When I think of Kobato&#039;s adventure, it really makes me think that her journey is the destination itself. It&#039;s a story full of discovery, sadness, heartbreak, but eventually, happiness! Optimism doesn&#039;t even begin to describe the overall story of Kobato. Sure, there is a lot of incredibly depressing moments, but really, do you think the bubbly Kobato will be depressed for long?<br />
<br />
In the end, Kobato&#039;s story isn&#039;t anything particularly special or groundbreaking, but it did what it was trying to do masterfully. Whether it be through Kobato&#039;s silly antics or the crushing heartbreak that some scenes will cause, Kobato definitely executes it&#039;s emotions well.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
I&#039;ve always been a fan of chibi deformations during comedic scenes. Shows like Aria the Animation, Full Metal Alchemist, Your Lie in April, and many others do it a lot. Out of all the chibi deformations, Kobato&#039;s is definitely my favorite (tied with Alphonse actually), for the reason that her facial expressions are SO ADORABLE! <br />
<br />
It isn&#039;t just the comedy aspects that Kobato&#039;s art excels in. There are a lot of absolutely serene and beautiful moments, both art and animation wise, which really added on to the either cheery or heart wrenching moods of these scenes. Kobato really knows how to support its story with the art style.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
Kobato&#039;s song is a recipe for disaster just waiting to come in at the right time to drink your salty tears. At least, that&#039;s what it did for me. The OST of this show is incredible, whether it be the uplifting and catchy tunes of comedic scenes, or the nostalgic and heart crushing melodies of the melodramatic scenes. Just like the art, the music supports the moods of the show.<br />
<br />
Oh, you want me to cover voice acting? HanaKana master race. Moving on...<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
HanaKana master race again. Moving on...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Aight, so Kobato! Again, she&#039;s a make or break character! If you love her lack of intelligence and adorable attitude, I can almost 100% guarantee you that you will like this show. ALMOST. If you think she&#039;s obnoxious, then I can also almost 100% guarantee you that you will hate this show. After all, just like HanaKana is in the anime industry, Kobato is everywhere in this show. She is the show itself! She is the comedy, she is the drama, she is the moe, she is everything!<br />
<br />
As for the other characters, they are surprisingly well developed and fleshed out, considering how much of the spotlight Kobato hogs. Ioryogi is the awesome other half of the Dobato Ioryogi comedy duo, as he is the slapstick wielder (except instead of a slapstick, he&#039;s a fire bender!!!!). Fujimoto-kun gives off an extremely douche bag vibe at the beginning, but he redeemed himself as a character TREMENDOUSLY throughout the series many times. He&#039;s got a lot of character (although he doesn&#039;t show it) and he&#039;s basically a tsuntsun. He gets a lot of development and has a great backstory as well. <br />
<br />
Even the most minor of side characters get a lot of love! Hell, even the main cast of Tsubasa Chronicles helps push the story along!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
At first I laughed my ass off. Then, I was absolutely in love with Kobato&#039;s moe. Then, I was crying so much that I could stack a Tear of the Goddess in one spell cast. Btw, thumbs up if you get that reference. It means you probably need to go outside.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
Overall, this show is an absolute blast. Again, it&#039;s a hit or miss series, and Kobato is the one shooting. If she hits you, prepare a box tissues, for you&#039;ll need them whenever you start crying or start doing some other unmentionable things IF YOU KNOW WHAT I&#039;M SAYIN!!<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Please HanaKana, have ma babies. <br />

    When I first came across Kobato, the anime at first glance seemed interesting but I wasn&#039;t sure if it would end up being my cup of tea. Now that I look back, I know I would have regreted not watching it because of how amazing it turned out to be.<br />
<br />
Words can&#039;t describe how much I loved this anime. It was so heartwarming and cute, you didn’t want to stop watching. Kobato had a tear-jerker side imbedded into it, just like a jewel on a ring, making the piece even more beautiful. CLAMP did a wonderful job constructing this masterpiece, taking a semi-generic idea and keeping

          <span style="display: none;" id="review98435">
        it fresh and out of the box. The character&#039;s personalities made this story worthwhile, along with the breath taking art. Kobato inched its way into my heart, forgive me if I&#039;m being too biased, making its mark on my top 10. The story has laughter that will keep you smiling and sadness that will wet your eyes, so grab a few tissues. Most of all Kobato&#039;s relationships and bonds made the anime come together, in friendship and in love. <br />
<br />
As all animes stand, there is always room for improvement, yet I feel that Kobato was excellent exactly the way it is.
