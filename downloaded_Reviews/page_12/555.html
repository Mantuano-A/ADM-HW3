    Secrets. Parents can&#039;t raise their children without them. My mom practically raised me on her own since my parents separated when I was young. At the risk of sounding conceited, I think she did a great job. Recently she shared a few secrets with me that she couldn’t tell me as a kid. Now that I’m 20, I understand why she needed to keep secrets, to protect me. <br />
<br />
Kakushi Goto is a neurotic single father and a mangaka. If you ever asked him what he does for a living... he’d lie. Not because he’s a bad person, because he’s determined to protect his eleven-year-old daughter,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344321">
        Hime, from learning that he draws ecchi. <br />
<br />
Kakushigoto captures the feeling of being a kid to a single parent whose doing everything they can on their own. There’s no guidebook to raising a child. Since Kakushi’s wife passed, he has done everything in his power to shield his daughter from the world. His anxiety-induced parental neurosis is often hilarious and exaggerated to the point of insanity. The humor is derived at his expense. Over and over, he catastrophizes and imagines the worst possible outcome. Whether it be fearing his daughter fell into a well, or that his manga may get canceled sending them into poverty. This kind of humor, rooted in a relatable and sympathetic reaction, is fantastic. Admittedly, there is a fine line between being hilariously perceptive and just plain ridiculous. Kakushigoto constantly teeters on that line, but it has a remarkable ability to fall on the right side of absurdist comedy. <br />
<br />
Whilst he juggles his secret career with the responsibilities as a father and learning how to raise Hime all on his own, Kakushi also deals with personal problems. Shame, self-confidence, imposter syndrome, and the impending threat of deadlines. The author constantly pokes fun at the plights of being a mangaka: Underpaid, overworked, stressed. <br />
<br />
I sympathize with Kakushi’s rush to finish his work because I do my best work right before the deadline. His ongoing rivalry with his editor makes for some of the best cynical banter in the show. They’re always at each other’s throats with passive-aggressive comments. This anime doesn’t sugarcoat the life of a full time mangaka. I learned a bit about the processes of producing manga and the editing process. Kakushi’s four assistants aren’t extraordinarily deep, but their self-deprecating humor and jabs at their boss are pretty funny. Kakushi’s employees are named after different phrases commonplace to mangaka artists. Plenty of other jokes are rooted in the Japanese language. Though the translators made it watchable, a few jokes were lost. <br />
<br />
Kakushi is either too conceited about his work or too shameful that he makes a living by drawing dirty jokes. His personality and goals are at odds, he wants to become a famous mangaka, but if he’s in the spotlight, Hime may find out his real identity. There’s a somber moment where Hime tells her dad she wants him to become someone important. She knows that’d make him happy, but it simply couldn’t happen. Kakushi tells her he wants her to grow up well. Ironically, their wishes contradict each other, but it is heartfelt nonetheless. Kakushi may be a busy single dad, but he does have a lot of friends to help take care of Hime. Throughout the day, friends visit the Goto residence to see Hime. Like most of the characters, Hime is adorably airheaded. To compensate, she’s as perceptive and empathetic as a real kid. She can tell her family is distinctly different from others, without a mother, and that her father struggles to take care of himself, his home, and his daughter. At one point she worries about inviting too many friends to her birthday party because of the stress it’d put on her dad, so she sacrifices her fun for her dad’s well being. Moments like these broke my heart. I know what it’s like to worry so much about my parents that I give up something for their well being. Nowadays I understand what my parents had to sacrifice to raise me.<br />
 <br />
Beneath the surface of this goofy show lies melancholy that sneaks up on you when you least expect it. Even after she passed away, Hime&#039;s mother still helps raise her daughter through boxes she prepared for her birthdays, full of symbolic gifts. One curiosity of the Goto family you’ll immediately notice is their home. They live in a modest one-story home that looks out of place in their neighborhood. Kakushi replicated his old family home when he lived with Hime’s mother so he could maintain his memories of an ideal family. The secrets that lie within their original home form somber epilogue chapters to every episode. The epilogues flash forward to Hime’s life six years later where her Kakushi is mysteriously gone. These chapters are completely tonally at odds with the fun-loving atmosphere of the main story. Strangely they stoked my interest each episode until the final reveal. <br />
<br />
Most of the humor is reliant on misunderstandings, which might bother some people. For me, it just worked. Even though it didn’t always make me laugh out loud, it never failed to put a smile on my face. Kakushigoto captures the special kind of sincere family comedy that warmed my heart each episode.

    ‘Kakushigoto’ means secrets. ‘Kakushi Gotou’ is the father’s name. ‘Kaku shigoto’ can be defined as a drawing job. So, the entire situation that Gotou put himself in, is meant to be an ironic pun. He’s hiding some secrets from his daughter, Hime to spare himself the embarrassment if she ever finds out. However, it seems that there is much more to his secrets other than being a vulgar mangaka.<br />
<br />
All the silly, yet somewhat effective attempts he’s done to hide his secrets are the highlights of the show so far. He’s somewhat like an overly-cautious dad for a change, doing his best to raise his oblivious

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336826">
        and cute daughter. His voice actor, Hiroshi has the ability to switch from a playful and deadly serious tone (Levi from Attack on Titan) to a caring young-father-figure which really matches his character build. Hime, on the other hand is voiced by the same VA of Emilia from ReZero, and Megumin from Konosuba. So yes, you might have noticed a bit of childish and innocent type of kindness when she speaks. This duo is more or less, a great pick for this show.<br />
<br />
The art and animation are decent, with the art style frequently changing whenever comedic scenes cue in. The opening and ending are both soothing, and I really enjoyed the overall calm ambience that they are aiming for. It’s like a hint to something greater, a big reveal that would crush the peacefulness that they are living in. Yet, you just want to cling for more of their hearty interaction.<br />
<br />
Overall, Kakushigoto is a change of pace for just a normal portrayal of father-daughter relationship, with comedy that I couldn’t help grinning to, and a poignant feeling that is lingering around it. Many seeds have been planted for the secrets of Gotou, and it looks like we might not be able to taste this sweetness for long. So for now, I’m just gonna enjoy it for what it is. <br />
<br />
You should too, before it hits right in your feels.<br />

    In a Nutshell <br />
Gotou Kakushi is a mangaka, a well-known mangaka. He is known for many ecchi titles, many fans across the world highly appreciate. However, his life changes, when he becomes a father. Gatou now tries to prepare for his new life and to hide his secret from his daughter. Will he succeed?<br />
<br />
Storyline<br />
Kakushigoto&#039;s source manga is written by Kouji Kumeta, fans of Zetsubou-Sensei should know that name. Itoshiki Nozomu and Gotou Kakushi are even voiced by the same voice actor, Kamiya Hiroshi. Fans of Zetsubou-Sensei might be more prepared for Kakushigoto than other viewers, but it does not mean that it should be the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344307">
        reason for you to avoid this series in any way. Anyways, this series is full of gags, puns, and references that are somewhat difficult to understand, but it does not imply that these jokes have ever been bad, or dirty. In addition to this, the storyline makes sense and is very enjoyable to follow. Kakushi Goto is a very famous mangaka, many people do not know how he looks like, but know the name. When his daughter was born, he decided to hide his occupation from his daughter at any cost, but he could not stop making his pervy manga series, because he needed money to support his daughter Hime all on his own.<br />
<br />
Animation<br />
The animation is very unusual and it might take you some time to get used to it, if you have never seen Goodbye Teacher Despair. But after a few episodes, you will get used to it and you will understand how amazingly beautiful and unusual the animation is. There are so many colors and everything about it fits perfectly what this series is trying to be; a slice of life with a light comedy; it is very enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Sound wise I would never say that the OST is some mind-blowing experience, but it fits the show well and helps to create the atmosphere of a slice of life series to help the viewer appreciate the series. However, the voice actors did do their best to make this series quite entertaining, unlike the OST. <br />
<br />
Parents Always Want Best For Their Children<br />
Gotou Kakushi, as it has been stated many times already, wants to hide his occupation from his daughter. He even has an emergency protocol for his assistants, should Gotou’s daughter arrive unannounced. However, it is quite unlikely, since his studio is far away from their home. This, indeed, is quite an easy thing for a parent to do. And what is the harm? He is a famous mangaka and earns good money, because of the huge popularity his manga has. However, another conflict arises, the moment Gotou’s daughter makes a wish for her father to be a successful man and Gotou finds out about it. He even tries to make a new manga and starts making the new title, so he can be proud of what he is doing and show it to his daughter. <br />
<br />
Criticism<br />
I cannot think of anything that I can dislike about this series. Its storyline is quite unique and new, the art is weird, but quite enjoyable, Gotou is the creator of an erotic manga, but it is not a pornographic manga, or something like that. All his manga has is just some harmless erotic jokes. <br />
<br />
All in all, this is a very unusual series, but you should still, at least, try to watch this series. By try I mean that you need to watch 3, or more episodes for you to understand if you can watch it, or not. Kakushigoto has very entertaining sense of humor, many puns and references and it is just a heartwarming slice of life about a father that only wants the best for his daughter. Highly recommended for all anime fans, do give Kakushigoto a try.

    &quot;What is your secret?&quot; The Pandora&#039;s Box that awaits its eventual reveal, to a side of a parent no child wants to discover: the life of a vulgar or dirty mangaka. Such as in the case of this show: &quot;Dad&#039;s kakushigoto, kaku shigoto desu ka.&quot;<br />
<br />
To understand this show in a literal sense, this one word resembles two things: hidden things (or secrets), or split the words apart (kaku shigoto) and it takes on another meaning: drawing for livelihood. In the realm of father-daughter relationships in anime, I&#039;d say that this show really beats the others that came before it (Sweetness &amp; Lightning, Usagi Drop), and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344310">
        the plotlines rather easy but simple to follow and understand, and the expectations building around shifting from times past and present to recognize how parents&#039; secrets go way deeper than just revealing bits and pieces like the uncouth of such simple actions.<br />
<br />
Based on the manga of the same name from the mangaka that brought us &quot;Sayonara, Zetsubou-sensei&quot; Kouji Kumeta, Kakushigoto is a rather simple story that tells of the Goto father and daughter family, father Kakushi and daughter Hime, in their growing up stages without the ever-so-illusive mother figure. But to quote manga readers though: this simple story has a caveat - another Kakushigoto, in the form of black and crude humor that teaches manga readers (and now anime watchers) about the things present in the manga industry (heck, even Kumeta-sensei admits that this story is from his accounts of experiences being a mangaka), so that side of the story is really intriguing, yet is a good learning lesson as well.<br />
<br />
You may think that just the simple premise of Kakushi fighting every step of the way to save Hime from &quot;dirty evil&quot; will become boring over time, but nope, it actually builds upon the experience of Hime as she slowly learns to take things one at a time, whilst Kakushi tries all sorts of ways to not let his daughter&#039;s innocent eyes be paralyzed for the fact that the treatment of mangakas (in general) have lots of kakushigotos that can be ascertained as &quot;plain bad&quot;. Even at times where the comedy sticks and stales, it grows on you quick and elevates the experience overall.<br />
<br />
The supporting characters of Kakushi&#039;s circle, I must really give them props for handling comedy interactions quite well. From his artist circle G-PRO (Shiji, Ami, Rasuna, Kakeru and even ol&#039; Joker-cum-editor Tomaruin) to the unconscious harem that he made (from that one episode which was just insanely hilarious all the way through), adding housemaid Nadila, every single one of them contributes to Kakushi&#039;s well-being of trying their best to evade Hime from ANY signs of &quot;trouble&quot; that brews from time to time. Heck, I&#039;d even go as far as to say that Tomaruin, as much as he&#039;s a sicko for wanting to threaten Kakushi&#039;s position to Hime, he is my favourite character for being a plain ditz and misunderstanding situations that are put in peril. This man meant no harm, but he always brings unwarranted attention to the door, and I always have a great time laughing at his mistakes SO HARD he can be a troll at times.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, with this season marking the start of the COVID season of delays, meant that quality can be inconsistent at times (due to shortage of manpower), and this show kinda suffers a bit in the visuals department (that Ajia-do Animation Works has to outsource to get things done). Only a bit, but this experience fortunately (and luckily) didn&#039;t supersede into delays, and I really respect the production staff for getting this done without delays (which is the case for most anime in 2020, and going forward). Despite the crunch though, the artwork is somewhat simplistic, yet being able to show off some vibrancy in the visuals and create watchable content altogether, same as to a double comparison with the manga.<br />
<br />
Even better is the sound department. The VAs really give a great account to the temperament to the characters, especially Hiroshi Kamiya and to-be-expected Rie Takahashi playing both the Father and Daughter role respectively. And once again, props to veteran VA Natsuki Hanae for voicing for Tomaruin, how he handled this lame-ass, disingenuous character is one of profound surprises. Not to be outdone, is the opening and ending theme songs. Flumpool&#039;s OP was a song that was just magnificent for entering the stage of this show, literally taking flight of this show&#039;s growing popularity overtime. What I was most surprised about is the ED, done by the deceased Eiichi Ohtaki based on his 1981 song, and it&#039;s very unconventional for anime to re-use old, lost-in-time properties, so much so that the song is another great folk-tune-ish classic.<br />
<br />
All in all, Kakushigoto is a show that other than the main focus of the gripping of the family saga that&#039;s filled with sweetness and lightning (the secrets hanging in the balance), is a nice change of comedy to add into the slice-of-life genre. A heartwarming, yet sad masterpiece of a show not to be missed, and one of the underrated greats this season has to offer. Try it, you won&#039;t be disappointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#039;s your secret?&quot; My not-so-secret is that I can say that I&#039;ve finished this show with a smile of happiness on my face.

    Seemingly, the last 3 or 4 seasons have given us something to make us feel warm and cozy on the inside. In today’s world, we probably need that more than ever. <br />
<br />
This season’s wholesome heartwarming series was Kakushigoto. Based on a widely acclaimed manga, the story follows a mangaka, his assistants and his daughter as he attempts to balance being a high selling mangaka with his responsibilities as a father. To further complicate things, Goto wants to keep his real occupation as a mangaka hidden from his daughter.<br />
<br />
The show follows them on their adorable and often hilarious day to day activities. Whether it’s Hime and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344308">
        her dad going to an onsen on a free trip that she won or them going to Kidzania, the show offers enhoyable slice of life moments that allow you to connect with and form attachments with the characters. <br />
<br />
While on the surface, the series seems to be very lighthearted and a constant stream of smiles and laughs, there’s actually a rather interesting juxtaposition in narratives. The first 20 minutes or so of every episode is told from the past perspective of Hime, while the final 4 minutes take place in the future following a time-skip with a much darker colour palette as well as tone. The questions that this segment leaves you with after every episode will have you on the edge of your seat awaiting the following episode for more answers. So, if you like bingeable shows with content that keeps you engaged, this is your show.<br />
<br />
From a technical standpoint, the artstyle is very well done and has a unique look to it. Colours pop and backgrounds are rendered gorgeously. The top notch production quality remains consistent throughout.<br />
<br />
I came into this series knowing nothing of the series and came out of it reading the manga and a big fan. This is a genuinely great show that offers life lessons on parenting, communication and provides consistent heartwarming entertainment. I can’t recommend it enough. Kakushigoto gets 9 Inu’s out of 10.

    This is a solid show with a number of laughs, along with the cast being great in their own right too, and I honestly cannot wait for more of it as it goes along, so you should check it out if you haven&#039;t as of yet! Here is why!<br />
<br />
The characters are wild, energetic, in terms of Hime&#039;s dad and his co-workers. Very lovable, each and every one of them. While Hime herself is an angel, she&#039;s sweet, smart, and just lovely. What a lovely set of characters.<br />
<br />
The art style is colourful and very good to look at. It&#039;s that right kind of bright colours that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336821">
        really fit well together. Same goes for the sound, it&#039;s all very nice.<br />
<br />
The story itself, it does way better than another anime that has a same plot line that I won&#039;t spoil, but this show does it way better than that does. The comedy in this show is just great within the story, seeing how Hime&#039;s dad tries to cover up anything remotely suggesting his work place. All the while showing Hime&#039;s growth and what she&#039;s up to. It&#039;s very sweet and loving.<br />
<br />
So you should check it out! I&#039;m gonna keep watching, and you should too!

    Kakushigoto is one of those very rare slice of life animes that give you laughs and a bittersweet feeling. The anime portrays  a father-daughter relation very vividly, one which very few studios have done properly, or have even attempted to create. This anime is in many ways similar to Usagi Drop ( the anime, not the manga) but in my view has shown the relationship better.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed how simple yet heart warming this anime is, it does not complicate the story with intertwining plot lines and rather gives a really good slice of life story with lots of comedy. <br />
<br />
The sound and art

        are bother pretty decent. The character development at the time of writing this article is really interesting and deep. I really think its a worthwhile watch.

       Kakushigoto is a slice of life and comedy anime(originally a manga). Which follows Gotou Kakushi, a fairly well-known manga artist who draws vulgar manga. Kakushi desperately tries to hide the fact that he draws manga from his daughter, Gotou Hime. He goes to extreme lengths to ensure that his daughter will never find out. Which sometimes create funny and wholesome situations. It is also important to mention that Kakushigoto is framed as a flashback. The events have already happened and we are simply relieving them. <br />
<br />
    

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336820">
          Though simple in its premise, Kakushigoto is a very interesting watch. The art and animation may take time to get used to. But I think it suits the show quite nicely. The sound design is nothing ground-breaking. Though I have to admit, the opening is a banger. It is noteworthy to mention that the opening makes it seems as though Kakushi has already passed away(I am not sure, hadn&#039;t read the manga yet) Although not perfect, each character is quirky and unique enough to easily distinguish them from one another.<br />
       I enjoyed Kakushigoto a lot more then I would have expected. Each episode is so wholesome, every time I watch this show it puts a smile on my face. Hime is such a precious girl, and should be protected at all costs.<br />
<br />
       In conclusion, Kakushigoto is a great show to watch if you want to smile. The story is nothing special. But the art, sound design, and characters are all great. It&#039;s also a fun and wholesome watch. In some scenes, it&#039;s even made me laugh out loud. Though I&#039;m not quite sure yet whether this show is going to be a wholesome show till the end. Or if it&#039;s gonna pull my heartstrings(The way Kakushi suddenly disappears when Hime grows up in the opening does seem to make it look like he&#039;s not alive anymore. Though as I said, I&#039;m not sure. This is just what I felt when I saw the opening). No matter which way the story ends up going, one thing is certain. You&#039;re definitely going to get a first-class seat at experiencing it till the end.

    Kakushigoto is the Hitou Nami of anime. By that which I mean it is a completely fine and serviceable anime, but otherwise incredibly average and normal. If I had never watched any of the author&#039;s previous manga-to-anime adaptations, I may have been more lenient with it. However, in an ironic culture counter-current moment, I was introduced to Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei through this show, which heavily influenced my expectations of this show moving forward, in both style and substance.<br />
<br />
Unlike his previous works, Kakushigoto contains quite possibly the most positive (or least negative) self-depiction of Kumeta himself. No longer is he some loser whose eternally bitter about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344449">
        his assistant&#039;s successes or other works outselling him, Kakushigoto is instead a more wholesome or less cynical take on the manga industry through the eyes of a doting father. While this less cynical (I use the term because in no way is this work entirely wholesome or positive) work is somewhat refreshing, the fact of the matter is that it ultimately leads to an at best above average slice of life comedy that is somewhat forgettable by its conclusion. <br />
<br />
A central motive to the show is nostalgia. Present day scenes are beautifully animated with a different style to the past scenes, and, the ED especially nails the tone to a T. I&#039;ve also felt some nostalgia watching this throughout the past 3 months or so since I was constantly reminded of Shaft&#039;s SZS, that elusive golden past that is long gone, one way or another. The majority of the show with its slice-of-life comedy is not enough of a hook to draw me in unfortunately. There are some nice moments here and there , some good jokes or observations occasionally, but without the usual cynical or pessimistic worldview or even satire. It&#039;s just so normal. The only thing I could recall with any bit of clarity is that one bit in Episode 11 where it just turned to SZS for about 10 minutes. It&#039;s hilarious yet so out of place at the same time. <br />
<br />
The fact that I&#039;ve struggled to write out any more of this review without referencing SZS in any fashion speaks volumes, even the show itself can&#039;t escape being in the shadow of SZS given how many references both direct and indirect it has to it. Kakushigoto is just okay, even above average in a few instances, but I&#039;ve come to expect so much more given the author&#039;s previous works and style. And no, even if you have gotten Golden Age Era Shaft to animate this, it wouldn&#039;t have been any better. <br />
<br />

    A beautiful anime about a father who&#039;s a manga artist and his daughter who must be protected at all cost. <br />
<br />
Yes, this anime is comical and I laughed many times. But every episode the ending would be slightly depressing and it goes on until the final episode. If there&#039;s ever an anime that could make me laugh, chill and cry at the same time then this show would fit the bill. <br />
<br />
Shirobako and Bakuman was the only two standing alone as the legends of Manga &amp; Anime making, but now I think that there&#039;s one more series which could stand beside them. Kakushigoto, a happy,

        chill and depressing Slice of Life about a man who&#039;s a manga artist and also a father of a daughter who must be protected at all cost. <br />
<br />
10/10, no doubt. Recommended to those who are looking for a mix between comedy and depression SoL.

    A Kouji Kumeta work starring Hiroshi Kamiya with an MC who has one of their eyes covered? I&#039;ve NEVER seen that before.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve had a strange relationship with Kouji Kumeta. I recently tried to watch Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei and as much as I love season one, I simply couldn&#039;t get through season two. A similar occurrence happens when I tried to watch Joshiraku but with even worse results, I only made through three episodes before having to throw in the towel. The fact I finished this means, at least to degree, SZS wasn&#039;t a fluke.<br />
<br />
Kakushigoto is a story about the daughter of a decently successful

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344320">
        mangaka Kakushi Goto, discovering that her dad was the author of several ecchi gag manga. Not only that but Goto had successfully hid his occupation from his daughter for her entire life, because he thought if she were to discover his career she wouldn&#039;t respect his career anymore. one can safely assume hijinks will ensure from that premise alone and they do. Most of the story takes place in the past sometime in the 2010&#039;s while Hime was ten, Eventually cutting back to the future at the end of an episode when Hime is going through the storehouse where Goto had kept copies of his work.<br />
<br />
Kakushigoto is the most approachable work the author has made and that isn&#039;t necessarily a good or bad thing. Good in the sense that unlike his previous works there isn&#039;t as much of a reliance on references to things only Japanese people or huge weebs would understand, meaning one can find humor every episode. Though it can be bad because for those who do like his style, this can be seen as a watered down version of such. Nevertheless Kakushigoto being about a mangaka means that the author has to take the time to establish and explain what he&#039;s making jokes about, obviously because most people aren&#039;t decently successful mangaka. Meaning you will be able to understand the vast majority of the jokes as long as you&#039;ve seen an anime or two so you can laugh at the tropes he does decide to make fun of.<br />
<br />
The comedy in Kakushigoto is sometimes genuinely hilarious, while sometimes not having any effect on the viewer at all. Much like his previous work, the comedy is extremely hit or miss depending on the person and which topic Kumeta decides to explore at the time. Kakushigoto is designed to be broadly appealing, so there won&#039;t be a teacher having a harem of high school students or anything like that. I feel like I could show this to my uncle and he would probably find it hilarious as a working man in his early thirties if that says anything.<br />
<br />
Kakushigoto also has a number of heartwarming moments that occur periodically throughout each episode, typically involving goto discovering something about himself or his daughter that he didn&#039;t before and learning to appreciate her even more. These moments help to solidify the relationship and justify why Goto cares so much about his daughter, and why he would go through insane lengths to do things for her not involving hiding his job that to most would deem asinine. But at the same time I feel as though Hime is almost too perfect. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if there was at least one investor on the production committee who committed to this seemingly niche project on the pure basis that it was good population crisis propaganda *insert Shinzo Abe meme here*. Hime is almost saccharinely sweet, instead of showing realistic comedic scenarios a single parent would have to deal with in relation to Goto&#039;s job, Kumeta instead opts for showing the platonic ideal of a daughter, or at least what someone who doesn&#039;t have kids like himself who would want in a daughter. Because of this, there is an insane contrast in how grounded Kakushigoto would like to be.<br />
<br />
That doesn&#039;t mean there aren&#039;t effective emotional moments, there are some meditations about making manga in the 21st century that poignantly ascertains how difficult the job can be in an environment where print media in the developed world, not just Japan, is dying.<br />
<br />
When Kakushigoto decides to be a workplace comedy about Goto and his assistants/editor is where the show really shines in my eyes. Because this isn&#039;t a rise to glory story like Bakuman, you get insights into how the manga industry is run and what the people who work in it are like. Whilst taking jabs at the various quirks that are inexorably associated with said industry. Goto, being as eccentric and difficult to work with as a mangaka can get outside of releasing chapters with long hiatus&#039; in between, (*cough cough* Togashi *cough cough*) receives a particularly lazy, whiny, and stupid editor named tomaruin, of which at least a good chunk of the comedy comes from. There are a number of people who seem to genuinely hate this man, you will know if you hate him from episode 1 and if you do that could potentially hinder your enjoyment with the show. Goto dunks on him in the show enough that to me his inclusion is very much worthwhile. In fact Tomaruin is often unintentionally useful to Goto and once in a blue moon a great editor. Kumeta&#039;s metatextual big picture style of writing works some of its best when this character is on screen.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the side characters in Kakushigoto outside of Goto himself aren&#039;t fleshed out that well, his assistants are far more normal than he is so they have normal lives—seems pretty self explanatory. But Goto himself is very well characterized throughout the show, it never shies away from showing the man in situations where he is vulnerable, definitely a lot more balanced in that regard than Kumeta&#039;s previous works that I&#039;ve seen.<br />
<br />
In terms of visuals, Kakushigoto is great in completely skimming over a lot of the problems that plague modern anime. While not having any real kind of sakuga to speak of or the directorial flair of studio Shaft, especially Akiyuki Shinbo who handled SZS; Kakushigoto features solid animation with at times, especially in the future sections, well done digital backgrounds. Kumeta&#039;s style lends itself to simplicity, further accentuating the grounded yet eccentric atmosphere the show is trying to convey.<br />
<br />
While I&#039;m not going to spoil anything about the ending, I will say much like his most famous work SZS Kumeta pulls off an ending that not only subverts your expectations, but also recontextualizes what the entire story was about. Not to the same degree as SZS but enough that makes you feel as though the crescendo felt natural and novel at the same time. Thankfully, as he said in a video streamed by Funimation on twitter, Kakushigoto is a self contained story that is one-cour and that&#039;s that, thank God.<br />
<br />
Overall, Kakushigoto is a comedy that most people, especially most anime/manga fans can enjoy. Unfortunately because there were inevitably some episodes I didn&#039;t find funny, or because of the previously listed issues, I wasn&#039;t one of the individuals who the show was necessarily made for. But being so short, giving this show a chance is something I definitely wouldn&#039;t miss out.

    We need to talk about Kakushigoto, that wonderful work!<br />
This review contains spoilers.<br />
<br />
Kakushigoto tells the story of Kakushi and Hime, father and daughter, who live their days in a house, with great joy and casualness. At first, the anime is just funny, in addition to providing a very pleasant setting. However, Kakushi has a secret: he is a manga artist with obscene themes, that is, dirty jokes and suggestive of a negative understanding of his creator (in this case, Kakushi and his team).<br />
<br />
Knowing this, a lot of comedy is expected in the moments when Hime almost discovers his father&#039;s secret. And the work manages to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361399">
        incredibly well executed in this regard. Within each episode, Kakushi goes crazy with any possibility of everything going wrong, due to excessive concern for Hime, the person he loves most in this world.<br />
<br />
The secondary characters also have their importance, the group of women who are interested in Kakushi, his work team, in addition to the dog Roku, which has the most different and funny bark of late. The entire anime is built with the goal of forming friendships and resolving Kakushi&#039;s secret. And this is where I want to give more emphasis.<br />
<br />
Although the secret seems silly at first, Kakush has a great reason to hide his past from his daughter. Kakushi&#039;s wife passed away when Hime was still very young, being a deep sadness for Kakushi. He, as a father, started making gift boxes and other things for his daughter, in case something happened to him in the future, leaving Hime&#039;s aunt in charge of giving the key to the old family home to her niece, at any given moment. Kakushi&#039;s shaken mind, in addition to the goal of being a father and mother at the same time, made him be so affectionate with his daughter, doing everything to protect her, even if it means hiding the part he finds shameful, that of being a mangaka. In addition, Hime&#039;s grandfather (his mother&#039;s father) always gave gifts to her anonymously, precisely because of Kakushi&#039;s acts of protection.<br />
<br />
And the moment that Kakushi was planning happened. A few years later, he finished his manga, working on product shipments (which were manga, still holding Kakushi to his secret). On one of those days, he suffered an accident, being hospitalized soon after. However, when he wakes up, he forgets most of after finishing his previous work, forgetting even Hime, who was already older. For Kakushi, he is still in the past, with his youngest daughter and his team close by.<br />
<br />
From the last episode, I understood the final minutes that each previous episode was trying to show: Hime in the future, walking through the old house and discovering his father&#039;s secret things. The drama here was so intense that it made me apprehensive about what was to come. How could Hime get his father to remember everything?<br />
<br />
Hime then plans to take his father&#039;s work material to the hospital, where Kakushi remembers everything that happened, despairing in the end, in a comedy tone, as Hime discovered everything.<br />
<br />
Kakushigoto is a life lesson, an incredibly good anime with a job worthy of respect. I hadn&#039;t seen a cute, fun, dramatic and funny anime in a single production in a while. Congratulations to the entire team at Ajia-Do, for offering us one of the best anime of 2020.<br />

    &quot;What&#039;s your secret?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
For Kakushi Goto, everything changed the day Hime was born. Holding his newborn daughter in his arms, the doctor asks Goto, &quot;Hey, aren&#039;t you that manga artist? I read Balls of Fury all the time!&quot; To which a nurse responds, &quot;Oh I know, it&#039;s that really dirty one!&quot; ... From that moment on, Goto&#039;s life of secrecy began.<br />
<br />
From the author of Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei and Joshiraku, Kouji Kumeta and Studio Ajia-do bring us Kakushigoto - the story of a gag mangaka who has vowed to keep his job a secret from his daughter.<br />
<br />
Kakushigoto is a lot of things. It&#039;s a meta-commentary on the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344388">
        manga industry, it&#039;s a workplace comedy, it&#039;s a wholesome family slice-of-life, and it&#039;s a mystery/drama. Despite a loaded portfolio, Kakushigoto tells its story in a succinct 12 episodes. It&#039;s a character-driven narrative backed by excellent writing, stellar voice acting, and a simple, yet charming art design.<br />
<br />
Kouji Kumeta&#039;s appealing pop-art manga style translates fluently into anime form, but it&#039;s his writing that carries Kakushigoto. Goto and Hime are an adorable main duo, their daddy-daughter interplay is rife with lessons about parenting, communication, and learning social cues. The supporting cast covers a range of personalities and perspectives, adding many layers to a seemingly simple plot.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s the thing that&#039;ll hook you to Kakushigoto. On the surface, it&#039;s just a light-hearted comedy, but beneath that is a mystery that grows more suspenseful with each passing episode. By the end, I was deeply invested in Goto-sensei and Hime&#039;s story, and episode 12 offers a satisfying conclusion to that season-long build-up.<br />
<br />
Kouji Kumeta once again proves his chops as a master storyteller. Kakushigoto was an emotional rollercoaster and I couldn&#039;t be happier with its entire presentation. The secret&#039;s out - Kakushigoto is a must-watch for 2020!!

    This is the first time I&#039;m writing a review but I think I&#039;m following the guideline. <br />
<br />
So this series is about a father who is a mangaka raising a young girl by himself. It&#039;s about how he hides his job from his daughter due to the fact he writes mangas with dirty jokes in them, it is also an anime about how his daughter finds out his secret after she turns 18. <br />
<br />
Story- 9/10 <br />
In my opinion, this story is broken into two main parts. The story is very creative and it makes you want to know more. The first part about the father and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345525">
        his job has a bunch of puns and mediocre jokes and it creates a very light and upbeat mood. While the story about the daughter finding out her dad&#039;s secret is lonely and sad. There is a good balance between these two stories.<br />
<br />
Art- 7/10 <br />
The art isn&#039;t my style but it isn&#039;t exactly one of those really ugly art that want to make you rip your eyes out. I think the art and animation style successfully portrays the story and the mood of this anime. <br />
<br />
Sound- 6/10 <br />
Not sure what to write here. I liked the intro by flumpool and the ending wasn&#039;t really bad either. The sound effect was average? All I know was that the sound effect wasn&#039;t bad. <br />
<br />
Characters- 9/10<br />
The characters aren&#039;t the type of character with a deep background and story since it isn&#039;t the type of anime with characters like that. Most of the characters are in my opinion pretty simple-minded at some points and it goes together with the story.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment- 10/10<br />
I was satisfied with the anime and enjoyed it a lot, the story had a pretty nice ending. The loose ends were tied together and it made sense, overall it came together well. <br />
<br />
Overall- 9/10<br />
I liked it, overall this anime was one of my favorites. Definitely suggest this anime to people who actually read my review.

    &quot;Kakushigoto&quot; means secrets and it&#039;s the father&#039;s name hinthing that the anime is based off of secrets. <br />
<br />
Storyline<br />
Kakushi Goto is a well known mangaka who wants to seal away the secret of him being a mangaka from his daughter because he doesn&#039;t want his daughter to know that he makes dirty jokes in his manga for a living.<br />
<br />
Animation<br />
The animation is unique, it gives off an interesting vibe. The animation is really beautiful and it&#039;s not the type of animation you see in your typical type of anime.<br />
<br />
Music<br />
I want to start off by saying that the opening is a banger, the lyrics and the instrument are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344387">
        really well put together. The soundtracks they use during each episode are well structured as well. The ending is a bit different, it&#039;s really well put together as well.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
The characters are really well thoughtout. You&#039;ll be taking a liking of the characters since the first episode because they make each episode entertaining and wholesome.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
Did I enjoy this anime? Hell yeah, I did. From start to finish, it was amazing. This anime will put you through a rollercoaster of emotions. Each episode is filled with joy and laughter but by the end a bit sad.<br />
<br />
Do I recommend watching this anime?<br />
Yeah, you definitely should watch it if you have time to do it. It&#039;s worth your time because the story, art, music and characters are amazing and you&#039;ll enjoy it a lot.

    Ok, first things first, the name of the anime is kinda joking with all the situation。かくしごと (kakushigoto) means secret, which is the same name of the main character (Kakushi Goto) and his work, could be called in japanese as kaku shigoto (kaku means write, and shigoto means work, labor). So the anime is all centered joke in the main character and this is awesome. So let&#039;s start reviewing:<br />
<br />
Story: The story is kinda simple, it tells a pov from a over protective father and since the first episodes we know that is a flashback, telling by someone&#039;s view. But the way that they develop the plot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354573">
        all over mixing the humor with sadness is awesome. It&#039;s the way that the anime found to maintain the audience watching the show not only because the relationship between daughter and father is cute and funny, but because you need to know what happen between the past and the present date due the stories and characters dialogues in the end of very each episode. The only problem, is that in the final three episodes, everything felt rushed and the past stories was hard to link and connect all the emotions that should have passed over between anime and audience (8/10)<br />
<br />
Art: The art for me is great. I mean, doesn&#039;t have a fluid animation, but the character design and the background are genuinely part of that world, they combine the elements of comedy and drama in the art. Just make a test: watch any episode, and note the difference between the background colors in the past stories, with the comedy focus, and then note the colors at the end of episode focusing the drama, so it&#039;s kinda catchy the way they do it, and i love it (9/10)<br />
<br />
Sound: The sound was the focus of this anime. The op and ed are truly awesome and rememorable, but beyond that, the sound design are not one of the best, but also aren&#039;t so bad, which means is kinda related to what the anime propose itself. It&#039;s fair to say that the sound is good enough for the anime, but if we analyze properly with more focus, we&#039;ll see that it&#039;s not that thing that we should expect (6/10)<br />
<br />
Character: The characters of this anime are all truly awesome. We have a dedicated father but which also are a liar (and this doesn&#039;t bother anyone who&#039;s watching), we have a teacher that have a crush on a student&#039;s father, the editor which is the worst that we can think about (but his ego proves it wrong) and etc. All the characteers are important somehow, even if they are not properly developed into the plot, but it&#039;s not a problem, because we know that they aren&#039;t the focus of the story, so it&#039;s not a major problem f we can&#039;t see them very often. For me, this anime it&#039;s only good because of the characters, they are so funny and have so fixed characteristics, that make them awesome. (9/10)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Well, I really enjoy the anime, but I need to make a note over here. I stopped the anime in the 9th episode (i was watching ongoing, but I&#039;ve finished only after the anime ended) because I was not mental prepared to what happened to Goto because of personal statements in my life, and maybe this make me not enjoy the last 4 episodes as I should, so because of ths, I felt truly rushed at the end but nothing that could prevent me to enjoy this fantastic anime. (8/10)<br />
<br />
Overall: I surely would recommend to everyone to watch, s not that great anime that come over your mind when you trying to make someone watch, but it was a very surprising seasonal anime, and that&#039;s why i think &#039;ve liked so much. (8/10)<br />

    A lighthearted comedy with a good story.<br />
By all means, give this anime a try! (tl;dr at the bottom)<br />
<br />
Starting off, one huge upside of this show that really gets the viewer is the story&#039;s foreshadowing, it really makes a big difference in Kakushigoto&#039;s story. Since the start of the first episode, it&#039;s introduced to us a different perspective from the normal daily life that Gotou and Hime have in most part of the series, and, of course, these foreshadowings will continue through the whole anime until the very last episode.<br />
<br />
Now, what&#039;s the biggest downside? (But don&#039;t get me wrong, that&#039;s the only one I can think

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344376">
        of)<br />
For what you might notice, the details around Kakushi Gotou and Hime&#039;s family leave nothing to be desired, and that&#039;s great, but sometimes that&#039;s not the case. To make it clearer, but also trying my best to keep any spoilers away, it&#039;s normal that some characters will have more screen time than others, meaning that you may find them in different scenarios and even taking different actions, possibily making them more charismatic towards the audience, but getting straight to the point, there&#039;s no excuse to why a side-character should always be used to the same reason, which is somewhat present in the show. Nevertheless, they&#039;re neither upsetting nor useless, but they don&#039;t really add much to the story or the comedy.<br />
<br />
Bigger upsides and downsides aside, it&#039;s a overall pretty enjoyable show.<br />
The art is different from the most commonly know anime, and yet very fitting for Kakushigoto. As for the music, both the opening and the ending are very good songs within the secrets/hidden things theme, where the OP is a j-pop/j-rock and the ED is a japanese song from 80s.<br />
<br />
All in all, before you go watch it you should also notice that...<br />
...as I said, it&#039;s a lighthearted comedy, in other words, most of the topics brought up will be covered in a more cute and light way than usual, such as being a single father and some other family related difficulties that Kakushi Gotou had or still have, as well as some topics including his work as a mangaka.<br />
In addition to it, you should expect a really fun and cute show, yet not a hilarious, rolling on the floor, kind of show and neither a moe level kind of cuteness.<br />
<br />
I hope you will enjoy watching Kakushigoto!<br />
---<br />
<br />
tl;dr<br />
The foreshadowing is the biggest upside;<br />
You might not care for a few of the side-characters;<br />
It&#039;s a really fun comedy, but you won&#039;t run out of air while laughting;<br />
If are worried about the cute artstyle, it fits the anime;<br />
Just go and watch it! ^^

    Did you ever start watching an anime knowing 100% that it will mess you up emotionally every week? Very rarely do I find an anime that I know will hit the feels in a very subtle way every week. I think the most recent anime I remember doing that recently was Gakuen Babysitters and that was more than 2 years ago. Well, Kakushigoto is just that. <br />
<br />
<br />
Kakushigoto has one of the best father-daughter relationship stories I have ever seen. It is a very charming anime with charming characters that really displays struggles parents face. It captures the struggling parent who does his best to keep

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344334">
        his child happy and not making her worry no matter what as well as displaying the very adorable nature of the child in a very relaxing fitting way. The anime&#039;s relaxing atmosphere and the way it choose to present its happy and sad moments worked very well to present the relationship between our 2 MCs in a very amazing way.  What made this work perfectly was also thanks to the voice actors&#039; amazing job and how they brought life into the characters so big credits to them. <br />
<br />
One of the most influential characters of the anime was Hime&#039;s mother. A character who is supposedly dead before the anime starts, turns out to be one of the biggest reasons both our characters grow. She is a very caring mother who did her best to support her child with boxes containing things she thinks Hime might need. Although you very rarely see her in flashbacks, the anime was able to portray the mother&#039;s love in a very unique and great way. You could feel the love she put into making sure her child is never in need of anything. This was something so inspiring that it made Goto himself start doing it. Writing such an amazing character with almost no dialogue is just astonishing. <br />
<br />
The other characters were also great. As a fairly big cast for a 12 episode anime, almost every character was fleshed out and well-written, each had his own distinctions and cute moments that made you like them even if they are portrayed as the annoying type of character. <br />
<br />
The art is fantastic, I love the mangaka&#039;s art in general since zetsubou sensei and I&#039;m glad to say that the anime adapted it perfectly in a great art style which gave it justice. The sound directing was amazing as well as it made the anime more flourshied. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, I would give Kakushigoto a 9/10. I want to see more of it if there is any material left. <br />
Would recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a very cute relaxing anime with some feels in between.

    I haven&#039;t read the manga yet so this review is purely based on the 4 episodes I have seen so far. First off, the name &quot;Kakushigoto&quot; itself is a pun, meaning &quot;Someone who writes for a living&quot; and &quot;A secret&quot;  pretty much perfectly describing Kakushi&#039;s situation. The art is simple yet elegant, to be expected of Koji Kumeta (Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei). The opening is one of the best this season for sure, a beautiful track with equally beautiful visuals. However, the characters are where this show shines. Kakushi plays the role of an overprotective dad who doesn&#039;t want his daughter to find out about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337359">
        his adult manga business. Hime, Kakushi&#039;s daughter perfectly represents the innocence of childhood. She definitely charmed me with her simple yet caring nature. Kakushi&#039;s motley crew of writers and assistants all have their moments in supporting Kakushi in one of his over the top acts to protect his daughter though none have been fleshed out yet (I am definitely hoping they do). There is some light foreshadowing for the future as well. This show&#039;s comedy definitely comes through to tickle my funny bone. That mixed with the endearing relationship of Kakushi and Hime make this an easy recommend for the season.
