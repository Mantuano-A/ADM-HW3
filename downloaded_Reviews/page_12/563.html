    *Review for all the Seasons of Working!!!<br />
<br />
let&#039;s start at saying Wow!.<br />
<br />
Working!!, Working&#039;!! and Working!!! are anime that based of Real-Life Comedy.<br />
<br />
With decent Character Development, and thats why it gets the Comedy going, the Decent Character Development makes it easier to understand and enjoy the Comedy in this anime, but they did a really good job at balancing between Comedy and Character Development.<br />
<br />
Season 1 (Working!!) focuses on character introduction and Comedy introduction, where they tells us each character story.<br />
Souta has some kind of Adoring feeling to little things (including Water flea XD)<br />
Inami has a Phobia that makes her punch a man just by getting close to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200493">
        her.<br />
Taneshima is a High Schooler that lacks Height (she&#039;s so cute :3 )<br />
Souma is a mysterious person that always spies on other people secret.<br />
Kyoko is the Manager that does nothing except eating <br />
Yachiyo the chief that always carries a katana and serve Kyoko because of the Character Plot <br />
Satou is the Cook that always looks Cool and Calm (but he secretly has a Crush on Yachiyo<br />
Otto is the Restaurant Manager who is in search of his Lost Wife.......<br />
and finnaly Yamada who is an annoying little kid that always breaks the restaurants Appliances<br />
and they have many other Character Plot troughout Season 1, Balanced Character Plot and Comedy.<br />
<br />
Season 2 (Working&#039;!!), going with more Comedy and less Development.<br />
The comedy this season was not good, but it&#039;s Great!, i loved how they make things complicated with Comedy, and the comedy is not really mature so almost all-ages can take it.<br />
<br />
Season 3 (Working!!!), this is where the Character Development really takes place, Yamada meets up with her Real mom, Inami now runs away or cover her eyes when she meet Takanashi at close range, Satou finally confessed with Yachiyo and...... we meet Takanashi&#039;s Mom.....<br />
<br />
and so Working!! series is where you wanna be when you are new to anime, want to laugh hard without Mature content and if you&#039;re feeling down.<br />
<br />
for Anime Starters, this is for you!<br />
<br />
and i heard a Movie is coming up for Working!!! so bear with the Cliffhanger ok? XD

    When a show gets multiple seasons, it&#039;s usually due to the fact that either the show is popular enough to receive a second or third installment, or the production company just simply has the resources to make it happen.  So, with the working series coming out in its 3rd season since 2010, what happens here?<br />
<br />
Story: Do I really need to bother with story?  Because in all honesty, the story of this season is basically the same as it&#039;s always been.  Like the previous two alliterations, Working!!! (now with 3 exclamation marks) follows the story of the entire staff at a place called

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199874">
        Wagnaria as they all work and involved with each of their co-workers lives while getting closer as a group of workers.  Simple story, simple concept, somewhat overdone.<br />
<br />
Because it follows the general slice-of-life story still, the base story idea is rather bland as a result.  With the general premise being what it is, there has to be something that makes the show interesting, right?  Well, luckily, there is.<br />
<br />
Contrary to the previous two seasons, Working3 ties up a lot of the loose ends that the series has.  Because this season specifically is the sort of &quot;last season&quot; for the show (because there&#039;s apparently a one-hour special to really finish things up), a lot of the plot points that were brought up in previous seasons, the different issues that each character had, are as a result resolved and provide a neat little ending to the majority of the cast.  Working has been a SoL show that has proper story progression with its runtime, and with a lot of loose ties ending, it makes the show better as a result.  <br />
<br />
Comedy in Working is the same as it&#039;s always been.  You have characters with each of their random little quirks, gags, and personalities, all of them mashing together to create retorts onto each other&#039;s words and actions, as well as some general specifically &quot;character&quot; moments where one member of the cast makes their character shine for just a little moment.<br />
<br />
In the end, the story for this season of Working is just to tie things over.  As it is more plot-based than just the characters wasting precious screentime screwing around (though that does happen still), the story progression is as a result is much more like a story rather than your average slice of life for the most part.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Plot progression<br />
+ Character development<br />
+/- Character and retort comedy (Good and bad depending on your sense of humor)<br />
-  Bland story idea (It&#039;s still after all, a slice of life story idea.)<br />
<br />
Characters: Similarly, the characters in Working are still basically the same.  No one from the previous two seasons has been cut out, and in fact, the characters have changed development-wise rather than really adding in any new characters to the group.  But, as is working tradition, new characters are still added with each progressional season.<br />
<br />
As for the new characters of the bunch, the characters that were introduced are largely new members that serve to intertwine several other character relations.  With new members of the Takanashi family and other characters that tie up several other of the cast members&#039; issues, the series really doesn&#039;t take too much a hit from remembering everyone because they just aren&#039;t hard to remember and no one really takes away from the show; instead, creating a more vibrant show with the characters that it both introduces and has.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Good ol&#039; same cast<br />
+ New additions that benefitted the series (even slightly)<br />
+ Character development with the cast members.<br />
<br />
Art: Produced by A-1, the art, much like the rest of the series, is largely the same.  With the same style of animation and the same quality as it did previously, Working itself is a very consistent series when it comes to artwork, using a very vibrant color scheme and a rather simple look to the series that isn&#039;t too aesthetically overcomplicated or over-detailed.  <br />
<br />
In addition, the show goes back and uses the style of chibis and other character visual regressions in order to express the comedy of the show, including changing facial features, simplification, and some slight overdramaticism.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Same art style  (If it ain&#039;t broke, don&#039;t fix it.)<br />
<br />
Sound: The soundtrack is very similar to its other two seasons, with the OP and ED songs being these nice, fluffy tracks, without really any indication for them being memorable.  They&#039;re good in their own right, but they are honestly not songs that I would listen to on repeat.  <br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment: Following a series is a fun pastime for a lot of animegoers.  To essentially grow up with the cast with each new cour that the series is give, seeing the series come to the end is a bit of a bittersweet feeling.  While Working hasn&#039;t completely finished at the time of this review, the prospect of never watching another Working season gets me a little down, admittedly.<br />
<br />
Did I like this anime?<br />
<br />
Yes.  It&#039;s always fun to revisit the characters that you grow fond of, and this is no exception.  With the entire series now wrapped around solving everyone&#039;s problems, the show as a result became much different than its previous two cours because it moved our characters along to some very nice resolutions.  (Though, if Yamada were to stop breaking stuff, maybe I would&#039;ve had a little hope for her.)<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this anime?<br />
<br />
Well, there&#039;s not really anything to dislike for me personally.  It&#039;s a quaint little series that I enjoy and, while its story idea is a bit lackluster, I had no problem with just sitting down and see these characters talk and work with each other.  <br />
<br />
Would I recommend this anime?<br />
<br />
If it&#039;s for this season, only watch this after watching the first two seasons, because you will be completely lost on everything if you just start now.  If you have seen Working and like it, I highly recommend watching it.  It&#039;s a nice wrap up to a lot of the points that the previous Working&#039;s established and it&#039;s still basically the same show, so I see no reason not to if you liked it before.

    The 3rd season of Working!!! offers a lot of what fans of the series have been waiting for - closure. However, one glaring knot is yet left to be tied, and the overall score of this season would have been impacted greatly if not for the one-hour finale that you should watch right after you see this season called &quot;Working!!! Lord of the Takanashi&quot;.<br />
<br />
STORY - 7<br />
Working!!! takes its time going through all our friends at Wagnaria and resolves a lot of questions fans have been dying to know and pairings they&#039;ve been dying to see. The pacing is odd at times, and Yamada gets the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200404">
        lion&#039;s share of screen time in this season. Despite that, it manages to get the job done without being too wasteful or repetitive. And while fans may welcome more animated Working! material, one can&#039;t help but wonder if everything could have been squeezed into a season that took its sweet time jumping from arc to arc.<br />
<br />
Still, Working! is as funny as ever while still managing to tug at our heartstrings and be sentimental at the right moments. Things are changing at Wagnaria and it&#039;s not easy for everyone, and while Working! never takes itself too seriously, it shows us it&#039;s not afraid to have serious moments.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER - 9<br />
The quirky cast of Wagnaria is probably one of Working!&#039;s stronger suits, and it&#039;s always a joy to see these characters interact and see a romance go from awkward and painful tension to real mutual feelings. We&#039;ve seen characters like Inami grow and change a lot, and relationships like Satou and Yachiyo blossom. And now these things are finally starting to pay off and seeing them unfold on screen is a joy. <br />
<br />
There are also a few new characters this season like the masochistic ex-husband of the eldest Takanashi sister and Souta&#039;s mysterious mother - all of whom are funny in their own way and add a new dynamic to an already oddball family. <br />
<br />
ART &amp; SOUND - 7/8<br />
<br />
With A1 at the helm the style remains consistent and the art and animation is relatively solid. There&#039;s a few off-model scenes and  strange moments, but overall there was nothing glaring.<br />
<br />
The seiyu of Working! have done a stellar job this season bringing these characters to life through voice, and the sfx + music is fitting as always.<br />
<br />
As a Working! fan, I put enjoyment and overall score at an 8/10. The closure and character development this season was satisfactory, and while there are still some loose ends, you&#039;ll be more than satisfied with the final conclusion to the story in the special episode that follows this season.

    Something about this show is obviously working, as after two previous seasons of Working! I find myself working on a review for the third installment. It&#039;s been a fair amount of time since I&#039;ve watched the second season (goodness... three years or so?) so there&#039;s a lot to pull out of the cobwebs. While I&#039;m sure some of the minor characters are lost to me, it doesn&#039;t really matter. This third installment focuses on the actual important relationships; I&#039;m talking Takanashi and Inami, Satou and Todoroki, and the Yamadas. If you&#039;ve been waiting (or had forgotten that you were waiting) for further character development, this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203201">
        show has it in spades. Moreover, it adds a good kick of light romance to spice up the spotless, comedic slice-of-life. Though a light skimming of the second season might be in order, it isn&#039;t strictly necessary; that being said, if you haven&#039;t watched any of this, you should probably start with the original.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
Other than perhaps a tad more detail in the backgrounds, the animation in the show is pretty darn identical to that in the second season. Expect a warm look in the restaurant and in general good use of color, nothing spectacular with shading but reasonable. The characters are pretty much the same as well too; expect Taneshima to be extremely cute, Inami to still be shy, Yamada to be a troublemaker, etc.<br />
<br />
As with the previous season, don&#039;t expect much action. As for ecchi, Katanashi apparently does regress to Kotori chan for a bit- if that&#039;s your thing.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The show starts with a happy, playful OP that is fitting even though the melody isn&#039;t anything special. The ED likewise fits the slightly-disco like vibe with the guys singing, as in season 2. For those who liked the BGM feel of the previous seasons, you get more of the same here- light yet supportive when necessary.<br />
<br />
The show&#039;s massively veteran-studded cast returns, and boy does everyone deliver. Eri Kitamura does a great job in her fairly large role as her character Todoroki gets a lot more screen time. Kitamura and Kana Asumi have practice sessions saying names and it is just hilarious. You even get Ono Daisuke getting in on some action too as he aloofly attempts courting.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The show continues to refine its strong points in this third installment. As with the second season, there isn&#039;t any strong central plot holding things together, it&#039;s just another day at the family restaurant. That said the show does a great job of advancing character relations in concert with filling in obligatory scenes- such as Inami struggling to deal with male patrons or Takanashi taking the time to scold Yamada. Unlike the previous season, expect a lot of pretty big developments; these are not necessarily plot twists but more like large events that will ripple through the characters. Expect a very entertaining season with lots of comedic moments; I enjoyed it so much that I didn&#039;t realize how quickly the episodes were passing.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
This is where this season really shines; expect many characters to grow both physically and mentally. As mentioned above, this season doesn&#039;t hold back and advances relationships between multiple characters. Most of the character interactions are more like expectations after two seasons of development, but it is still hilarious nonetheless. If I were to mention a qualm with this section, it would be how the show expects you to remember everyone from the second season. Some of the seemingly insignificant supporting cast takes up a fair chunk of screen time at points in the show, and I could only scratch my head in vain attempting to recollect whom they were.<br />
<br />
Value:<br />
For pure comedic value this is a great show, it just works. Add on a strong character development and you end up with an entertaining piece that is fulfilling at multiple levels. I came into this season expecting a 4-koma like show with baseline entertainment value and just more of the same- oh how wrong I was this time. For a show with as plain of a setting as a simple restaurant, they sure do deliver some great characters. Overall, this great installment contributes meaningfully to the franchise; I highly recommend this to those who liked the previous seasons.

    Ok, so the 3rd season has jaz ended,so no more BS and I&#039;m jaz gonna go straight to the point as to my views about this anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The story is a mediocre, since it still rely on the usual setting and characters, but even so it has presented a couple of development which is necessary in all sequel of anime whom were going for a 3rd sequel. So in general this 3rd sequel is good and doesn&#039;t rely on the usual gags and jokes, so..........<br />
<br />
My verdict: a Good 7.<br />
<br />
Art: <br />
<br />
So far nothing has charge when it comes to the character designed there was still that moe

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199935">
        thing that is an ever present in all anime and manga and as usual there was still someone who is the quintessential Zettai Riyoki in Yamada Aoi, so........<br />
<br />
I&#039;m giving this category a Mediocre 5.<br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
<br />
Well, nothing has change when it comes to the seiyuus who did the character&#039;s voice, thought the opening theme was nice I barely like it, so since there isn&#039;t much for me to say about this category........<br />
<br />
I&#039;m jaz gonna go for Mediocre 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: <br />
<br />
Just like the art and sound nothing has change with the characters in this 3rd sequel, but then again, since there have been some character development here in terms of romance and relationship like Satou and Yachiyo formalizing their relationship, having other support characters like Takanashi&#039;s sisters having some aired time and Takanashi and Inami getting closer with each other, But it was a bit unfortunate that Maya Matsumoto was still limited as a small extra.  IMO it would be fair enough that this category should......<br />
<br />
be a Fair 6.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: <br />
<br />
In general some episodes were enjoyable, but there are some that weren&#039;t cu&#039;z some of those episodes falls back on the usual restaurant setting, so even though I enjoy some of the episodes, in general I barely enjoy this anime at all.<br />
<br />
So a Fair 6 would be fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
There may have been some development, some episode were enjoyable some maybe boring, but then again to give this 3rd sequel a low score would not be fair, but that&#039;s just me, I don&#039;t know about you guys out there, so I&#039;m  jaz gonna rate this 3rd sequel a........<br />
<br />
Fair 6.<br />
<br />
PEACE MUCHACHOS!      <br />
<br />

    Story: 7/10 Good old Wagnaria. I&#039;ve been following this series since the first season began airing. Its truly been a pleasure watching these characters on screen. The story is a simple yet enjoyable slice of life. However, the third season had much more substance compared to its preceding seasons.<br />
<br />
One downside to Wagnaria, is that its jokes follow the same repetitive formula. I wouldn&#039;t recommend marathoning all three seasons because of this. Thankfully this issue wasn&#039;t as severe in this season since as i mentioned, it focuses on multiple plots throughout the series.<br />
<br />
The biggest disappointment for me was the last episode. The pacing was strange and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200308">
        it ended up feeling forced and rushed. For a series like this, I was really looking forward to a warm-hearted ending with closure. They set everything up perfectly with Yachiyo&#039;s departure and Tanashima&#039;s promotion, but those warm fuzzy feelings were interrupted by the producers trying to simultaneously fit in a rushed conclusion to Inami and Takanashi&#039;s plot.. which they weren&#039;t able to do so they pulled something out of their ass and ended it abruptly. <br />
<br />
Characters: 9/10 The characters are the backbone of Wagnaria.The cast is small yet solid and unique.  I&#039;ve honestly grown to love all of the characters in Wagnaria; including Takanashi&#039;s sisters, Otou-san, etc. In S3, we especially get to see lots of character development which was great (Yachiyo, Satou, Inami, Aoi, etc.)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10 I always enjoy sitting down and watching an episode of Wagnaria. Its light-hearted, cute, fun, and funny. To be honest, I&#039;d like a fourth season (especially because of that terrible last episode) because I enjoy it that much! <br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10

    The third season of Working is really, really good. Truth be told, I dont expect a lot from my slice of life anime...At most, I&#039;d expect maybe some vague signs that the show&#039;s couples would hook up and an open ending. <br />
<br />
So when we see our beloved Inami-san not strike a man once in the first few episodes, we shouldn&#039;t be surprised; indeed, the writers of season 3 are the ones throwing the punches as opposed to our beloved heroine.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Things happen. No, seriously. In a slice of life comedy where status quo is pro, seeing plot development is awesome. Plot elements like Yamada&#039;s family, Otoo&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200679">
        wife, the myriad romances, Takanashi&#039;s family, etc. all come to a head and seem fitted for a conclusion. While still full of ridiculous antics (like Taneshima pretending she is a Magical Girl fighting evil in a dream, or Yachiyo deciding which underwear to buy), the story actually progresses somewhere. The characters change to become more mature. Plot lines span multiple episodes.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s surprising to see in this type of series (but makes sense since the original manga is over) and makes for a great show.<br />
<br />
Art/Sound:<br />
v gud. Cute and whatever.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
They&#039;re back and far less one-note than they used to be.<br />
Takanashi aka Megane- Formerly a voice of reason, and in this season it&#039;s fun to see him riled up more due to dealing with his crazy family and romantic feelings for a certain someone...<br />
<br />
Inami aka Tumblr Feminist- Much less hating men and 100x cuter than ever before (and as nice as always). If you didn&#039;t like Inami before, she is much better here.<br />
<br />
Taneshima aka Loli-keeps the plot lighthearted and everyone in check.<br />
<br />
Satou aka Sanji-Will he finally get the courage to express his feelings for Yachiyo? Regardless, his grim outlook but overall nice guy swagger remains omnipresent.<br />
<br />
Yachiyo aka Samurai Brock-Much less clueless than before. Actually does things external of Kyouko san.<br />
<br />
Souma aka bastard-He&#039;s a bastard and we love it.<br />
<br />
Aoi Yamada aka Jesus Christ- Aoi Yamada does as Aoi Yamada do. Self absorbed and worthless at work, she gets some family episodes and development all to herself. No one deserves it more.<br />
<br />
Other workers-Kyouko-san, the two twins that follow her around, and Otoo-san are all there in full swing. All their quirks are there, but they interact with the cast a lot more this season and have their own subplots that get resolved.<br />
<br />
Takanashi sisters-The sisters actually have romantic prospects...While side characters in the original, the sisters find themselves being much more important here.<br />
<br />
Other characters-this is where the series shines. From the sadistic new addition Minegishi san to Takanashi&#039;s mother to the perverted Yamada (male), all the extra characters are outrageous and provide awesome comic relief to a season with many serious moments.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
This season is just a lot of fun. Seeing romance being given a lot of attention in a slice of life is a risky move, but it works. An amalgam of sad, serious, and comedic scenes come together to make this one of the better comedies. Even during a sad moment, jokes will be sprinkled throughout to keep the series lighthearted and fun. Yet, at the same time, the show isn&#039;t afraid of change-the dynamic will shift even if it means the same jokes cant be made over and over.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, Working season 3 is phenomenal. While I&#039;ll miss the staff of Wagnaria greatly, I&#039;m glad their story is getting a fitting end. At the very least, there will always be parfaits to eat.

    Overall:<br />
From the simple comedy that was season 1 to the plot focused season 3, Working!! has oddly a good metaphor of growing up. Reminds me of those carefree days no so long ago. Yet it remains it&#039;s lighthearted charm.<br />
<br />
The show has come a long way from when it started, and not in a bad way. There is considerably more plot in season 3, a slice of life anime where things actually happen. Unlike season 2 which teased you with development and didn&#039;t go anywhere, this season has real development. The amount of laughs and gags for the sake of it has gone down, but this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210046">
        is a good thing as repeating the same old gags would have gotten old.<br />
<br />
If you enjoyed the series or the genre, this season is probably the high point with every episode being memorable and enjoyable. However, season 3 is definitely not something one can jump into (like season 2 was) without watching the previous seasons. Enjoyment of the anime would be much lower, so if your new to the series, go watch season 1!<br />
<br />
As for the ending, this series is one of the few anime to pull off a satisfying and sweet ending (you have to watch the Movie/Episode 14)

    The adventures of Souta Takanashi, Mahiru Inami, Popura Taneshima, Jun Satou, Hiroomi Souma, Yachiyo Todoroki, Kyouko Shirafuji, and Aoi Yamada continue in the third installment of Working!!. This final season ties up the loose ends of the previous seasons. (Mostly.) <br />
<br />
It&#039;s been a long journey with this group of weirdos. Not as long for me, since I marathoned both seasons a couple weeks before the third season began, but for many, it&#039;s been five years. The danger of having THREE seasons of a comedy anime is kind of expected: the jokes start getting old and the humor becomes unfunny. I think that was Working!!!&#039;s biggest

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200105">
        issue. I could always tell when a punchline was coming, and many times I could actually predict what the punchline would be. Popura is the normal source of punchlines, but this season threw Aoi into the mix as well. The jokes themselves did not change. The third season of Working!! brings little new content to the comedy spectrum, and that is a shame. <br />
<br />
That said, one thing I saw in this season that I did not see in previous seasons was some serious character development. While it&#039;s masked with humor, Aoi reconciles with both her brother and mother, Inami reconciles with her father, and Kazue gets back together with her ex-fiancé. Satou and Yachiyo finally get together. And Satou tells Yachiyo he wants her to see more of the outside world! I believe this series had more substance than both previous series combined. <br />
<br />
My one gnawing grievance with Working!!! is that the side couple got together (Satou x Yachiyo), but the main couple (Takanashi x Inami) did not! Of course, they&#039;ve pretty much sealed the deal, but they haven&#039;t outright told each other that they like each other. There is supposed to be an hour-long special to conclude the series, but I&#039;m not sure it will bring closure to those two. It looks like a fantasy spoof. <br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t much to say about the music, art or animation. They&#039;ve pretty much stayed the same, although I think the animation had less hiccups this time around. The OP and ED are both very catchy, as usual. I watched them almost every week. <br />
<br />
I wish the final episode of Working!!! had been more conclusive. It felt like any other week&#039;s episode, and didn&#039;t give me even a fraction of the &quot;goodbye feels&quot; I was expecting to experience. I still liked this season a lot though, probably the most of all three seasons. But as much as I enjoyed Working!!!, I believe I&#039;ve had enough. There is nothing new that can be brought to the table, whether in comedy or character development. This show thrives on the characters&#039; odd personality quirks; they are meant to be shallow and distinguished only by their personal oddity. Therefore, normalizing them or trying to flesh them out is a bad idea; it would crumble the very foundation upon which Working!! stands. You know what I want to see another season of? The mangaka&#039;s other work, Servant x Service! <br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
Art: 7 <br />
Sound: 7 <br />
Character: 6 <br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
Final score: 7/10 <br />
Do I recommend it? Yes!

    ~ Working III ~<br />
[opening]<br />
This is really cheerful and light and watching it was really fun. So far it&#039;s the 3rd season, so the requirement should be: season 1 and 2 was watched. So the if you know the 1st and 2nd season...you&#039;ll be surprised in the 3rd season...since the typical cliched that was formed from both season was gone...the deconstructed everything and they made this season &quot;Romantic&quot;<br />
<br />
[how it was done 7/10]<br />
So far it has good art, for they stayed to the original style of it, and definitely better than the manga, they were able to present the characters in the proper way and was able

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200700">
        to combine it with great expression and mood. Background and the minor subject were made very well. In terms of sound, the Voice Actress/Actor was able to portray it very well, but for the BGM, it was able to meed the standard. As for the story pacing, it was really slow, but worth it. And the characters were able to meet its standard form<br />
<br />
[plot 7/10]<br />
The story is really great, since they&#039;ve changed a lot, you&#039;ll see the power of &quot;slow pacing&quot;, since it will be long for our main couple to date each other. The story is not focused on our main protagonist, but on our supporting protagonist, and you will feel the Romantic feeling in this season. And there are more revelations in this season, which is not the focused of the main story. The characters were able to perform their duty very well and the story were focused on the supporting, so Season 3 is basically a story for &quot;Supporting characters&quot; which already concluded the things they needed in order to close the story. And the Main Couple will close their story in the upcoming &quot;Special&quot; episode.<br />
<br />
[enjoyment 9/10]<br />
It&#039;s one of the happiest and lightest slice of life romcom you can watched after watching season 1 and 2. And I can say I really enjoyed this anime since they&#039;ve made some cheerful characters with a light story. I think only few will dislike this series, since it&#039;s meant for people who loves &quot;Light&quot; series, which is the opposite of dark or tragic, which I always enjoy.<br />
<br />
[worth 5/10] [Simple Creative]<br />
Since it was able to create something new and the characters changed a lot, it was good and enjoyable, it was able to bring out the potential of the characters and was able to meet up the conclusion without leaving a cliff hanger. In terms of its &quot;Focus&quot; or &quot;Themes&quot;, it&#039;s 10/10, but in terms of creativity and originalty, it&#039;s 5/10, or should I say, it was Above Mediocore or Average animes, which I rated 4/10(animes that meets up with your expectation) but this anime is quite creative which didn&#039;t rely on Mainstream Style, and was able to create a story which is quite original and the execution is really nice, yet the Goal or the conclusion of the anime is simply predictable.<br />
<br />
[closing]<br />
Since this is the 3rd season, I&#039;m hoping for our Main Couple to be officially called &quot;Dating&quot;, but it ended announcing that the real ending will be on the &quot;Special Episode&quot;...it&#039;s a nice anime and worth to be watched, and only few anime like this exist, A light with a plot anime with cute romance and especially it&#039;s value of improving and developing of every characters.

    What makes a great story? At least for me, a huge part of it is character development. Seeing imperfect characters and watching them mature, grow, overcome obstacles both within and without, and becoming stronger, wiser and kinder as a result. While you might not expect this kind of spiel to come out for a wacky comedy slice of life show, Working!!! is quite the special snowflake: a charming blend of lovable characters, hilarious interactions and an incredibly satisfying resolution. <br />
<br />
For those unaware: Working! is a comedy slice of life that revolves around a group of mostly part-time workers at a family restaurant. As expected, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201177">
        cast is a diverse range of characters, each with their own personalities and peculiarities - many of which are zany and wacky. However, it would be a mistake to assume that you&#039;ll find your typical anime stereotypes here; while some members of the main cast do fit into certain tropes, they&#039;re a far cry from your usual cardboard cut-out tsunderes and dojikos. <br />
<br />
The primary enjoyment of Working!!! comes from seeing the main cast of characters interact with each other through a variety of challenges and events, often to comical results. Few of the gags are predictable or hackneyed, as Working!!! works with its own rules, and its own peculiar, but very effective, brand of humor. The show is also surprisingly heart-warming or contemplative at times, but it never forgets the fact that first and foremost, it&#039;s a comedy show. The tone is uniformly light-hearted and warm. <br />
<br />
One of the things that impresses me most is how the main characters remain lovable and familiar, despite their various and many flaws - and sometimes because of them. By the third season, I had some kind of affection for the entirety of the main cast. This is surprising, since in the first season, the opposite was true; I was annoyed in some way by every single one. Looking back, my initial impressions seem hasty, but still somewhat fair. Then what made the difference? <br />
<br />
Of course, my own increased familiarity with the characters did make me much more forgiving of their antics, but more importantly, the main characters of Working!!! are so CUTE. And I don&#039;t mean that as in &#039;like a puppy&#039; (well, except Popura), but more &#039;endearing&#039;. A big part of this is because they all show signs of growth and positive development. There isn&#039;t a single character in the main cast that hasn&#039;t become wiser or kinder throughout the story. For a slice of life, I consider this to be quite the feat. <br />
<br />
My greatest praise for Working!!! is in how it handles wrapping up its numerous character and story arcs, many of which felt all over the place. Simply put, Working!!! completely surprised me by how deftly it handled these in a completely believable and satisfying manner, all the while maintaining its cheerful, warm atmosphere and consistent, laugh-out-loud humor. If you care about the cast of Working!!! at all by the start of season 3, the developments will certainly not disappoint. <br />
<br />
Time for some breaking down: <br />
<br />
STORY: 8 <br />
It&#039;s comedy slice of life, and the stakes are low. At the same time, it&#039;s nothing short of incredible how Working!!! handles its numerous character arcs and stories with care and attention,  in a way that feels both natural and unforced, while maintaining both its comedy and cuteness. As third seasons go, this is as satisfying as it gets. <br />
<br />
ART: 8 <br />
This isn&#039;t Studio Trigger or KyoAni, but it&#039;s the best I could ask for in a comedy slice of life. Working!!! is a pleasant show to look at, with great use of vibrant colors, and clean, crisp animation. The character designs and expressions are great, and most importantly, everything contributes to what the show stands for. <br />
<br />
SOUND: 8 <br />
The third season of Working!!! carries on its tradition of the high-energy, super-cute opening that&#039;s curiously catchy and addictive. The BGM is not all that noticeable, but that&#039;s to be expected. For what it&#039;s worth, it was appropriate and fitting. The voice acting is nothing short of perfect; each character is expressed equally well in both the serious and the comical moments. <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 8 <br />
By the start of this season, I felt like I knew everyone; by the end, I was fond of the whole pack of them. It&#039;s always impressive when a show manages to introduce a diverse range of flawed characters, and convinces you to adore them all anyway. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 9<br />
The best thing about Working!!! is that it&#039;s consistently entertaining. Almost every episode had me laughing out loud at multiple moments; and while the gags are definitely the main focus, the moments of romance and drama affected me far more than I ever thought possible for a comedy slice of life. <br />
<br />
OVERALL: 8 <br />
<br />
The first season of Working! was somewhat entertaining, but hardly impressive. It had somewhat interesting characters, but took some effort to finish. I enjoyed the second season much more, but it wasn&#039;t until the third season that I began to show signs of addiction. Simply put, I couldn&#039;t wait for more with Working!!! S3. A big part of it is because of everything set up in the previous two seasons; but since this is a comedy slice of life, I was never too sure what to expect of its resolution. So when the dominoes started falling and the character arcs took turns resolving themselves in such a funny, satisfying, and heartwarming manner, I was very, very pleasantly surprised. <br />
<br />
In some ways, the three seasons of Working!!! remind me of the Aria series, in that the first season sets up a lot of the premise and character dynamics; the second goes into full slice-of-life mode; and the third season takes everything that&#039;s been established and wraps them all up in a glorious celebration of joyful closure. There&#039;s almost no story or character arc that feels like they got the short end of the stick - besides, of course, the one arc that&#039;s been saved for last, in the upcoming one-hour special finale. Needless to say, I can&#039;t wait. <br />
<br />
In the end, Working!!! is an incredibly enjoyable and memorable show, with a diverse cast of lovable characters with hilarious relationships. Working!!! manages to do all of this as a gag-comedy slice of life with very consistent cuteness and laugh out loud humor, all the while completely devoid of cheap stereotypes or fan service. <br />
<br />
As long as you let yourself become comfortable with its quirky brand of humor, Working!!! will not fail to brighten your day. <br />

    after almost three years of waiting, finally there comes the third season of the unique and heart warming slice of life comedy show. and this time it comes bringing with it a conclusion to the story.<br />
that is to say in other words this is the last season of the anime &quot;working!!!&quot;. after all it already adapted the whole manga leaving nothing else to mention. it feels kinda sad doesn&#039;t it.<br />
<br />
well then, in short, the story is the same as usual. the regular cast of main characters spending their time working in wagnaria. if you already watched the former two season (wich you should have if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200772">
        you&#039;re reading this) then there is nothing really worth mentioning as a difference or change.<br />
the only aspect that didn&#039;t exist in both first ans second season is the fact of problemes/difficulties settling. yes all the problemes that occured throughout the whole series are now working them self out gradually while progressing in the show.<br />
am not expecting those who didn&#039;t watch the prequels yet to understand what i mean by &quot;problemes&quot; so to put it differently it&#039;s the kind of troubles that make the series more interesting and funny (misunderstandings, love confessions and such).<br />
as for the slice of life element, as expected it still manages to generate that heart warming feeling, brings a smile to the viewers and sometimes it gets you laughing.<br />
unfortunately every time a misunderstanding is solved it gives a sad impression since it marks one step ahead to the end of the story (at least that&#039;s how i feel)<br />
<br />
in addition to the common characters cast a few new people started making an appearance in the show, though they don&#039;t get that mush screen time, they don&#039;t feel out of place either, but rather they are necessary to the plot progression.<br />
some of the side characters also started getting more screen time, taking as an example the former husband of takanashi&#039;s big sister or yamada&#039;s big brother. in short everyone got his fair amount of screen that he deserves.<br />
considering this is the last season that will conclude the story, you can also clearly notice a huge character development occurring comparing to the prequels wich again, feels kind of sad.<br />
in short, everything will meet a conclusion here.<br />
<br />
the animation is not really flashy, however the quality definitely increased, not to mention it did a great job fitting with the theme of the show.<br />
another thing i want to say about the arts, it is about A.1.pictures, it never neglect any character when it comes to animating. you can sense that the design doesn&#039;t drop that much quality whenever they&#039;re in the background wich Indicates how rich this adaptation is.<br />
the OP and END consist of the same vocals and also maintain the unique atmosphere of the music. BGM is nice....nothing interesting to mention besides of yamada&#039;s cute voice.<br />
<br />
am not able to pick many negative points/thoughts about this season. maybe it&#039;s because i am a big fan of the series or because the show doesn&#039;t have mush weak points to begin with, but either way am trying to maintain an objective view as much as possible.<br />
as a whole working succeeded to keep it&#039;s usual pace. it doesn&#039;t feel boring at all, in the contrary it is very very enjoyable.<br />
i didn&#039;t watch the last episode yet, so am also waiting to see the way they will conclude the story, but am pretty sure it&#039;s going to be a satisfying ending. as a slice of life fan am proud to be an early fan of working and i think it deserves to be spared some of your time.

    [This review includes the special, and my overall enjoyment of the Working!! series]<br />
<br />
It is a fitting conclusion to a comedy anime adapted from a 4-koma.<br />
<br />
I like that it does not stray far from being a comedy while also accommodating for some development of the story and its characters. The usual banter is still there, and it is still funny for me (Yamada and her antics will never go old). Speaking of characters, Souma and Yamada are really the pillars of plot and comedy of Working!! They have made use of the other characters to progress the story. I really believe that Souma is an esper,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342011">
        and Yamada is Yamada.<br />
<br />
I like that one couple progressed in a somewhat realistic and mature manner, while the other on a very yonkoma way with a quest and a very unreal situation. <br />
<br />
I like that it has ended conclusively while also open to speculation for an epilogue. I like that it is a happy end, and I also would like to know their future.<br />
<br />
I LIKE THAT THEY PLAYED THE FIRST OPENING SONG.<br />
<br />
Someday, I might rewatch this series for Yamada. I really like Yamada.

    So this is my review for Working!!, Working&#039;!!, and Working!!! (the 3 seasons)<br />
<br />
There are very few animes out there that really make me sad to see it end. Working!! I can tell, will be nostalgic down the road in the future to me, It&#039;s really that good! I&#039;ve seen WWW.Working and I REALLY liked that. If you&#039;re a fan of comedy shows like The Office and such, you&#039;ll have no problem getting into Working!!. If you haven&#039;t seen the spinoff series, watch it, it&#039;s pretty good.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the story;<br />
The story, like WWW.Working, is a template. It&#039;s a simple concept, with plot stuffed in between,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274310">
        but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s bad at all! The story is simple, funny and enjoyable. It&#039;s really fun to watch if you don&#039;t like plot heavy animes.<br />
<br />
The Art;<br />
There&#039;s not much to say about the art... A-1 always do a fantastic job with their art and always deliver beautiful animes, some of them being my favorite. The art keeps it&#039;s quality high throughout the series across all episodes. It really works well in that sense.<br />
<br />
The Sound;<br />
I absolutely LOVED the OP&#039;s to all the seasons of Working!!. Especially when they brought it back in the closing scene of the series, it brought a tear to my eye. Everything was catchy and well made, no complaints here!<br />
<br />
The Characters;<br />
Every character was well made and seemed real. Like most good animes, they&#039;re well written. It&#039;s the most &quot;writing&quot; a character can have in a not-so plot heavy anime. They&#039;re all done very well and each one had their own personality. (Yamada was the best by the way)<br />
<br />
My Enjoyment &amp; Overall Score;<br />
I really LOVED Working!!. It&#039;s super easy to get into and I can guarantee you&#039;ll enjoy it. It&#039;s a 3 seasoned comedy with some romance slipped in between the cracks and it works really well. I&#039;d definitely recommend this, 100%!<br />
<br />
(Please don&#039;t get mad at Yamada, she&#039;s trying her best)

    Note: This review covers all 3 season of Working and the final special episode of Working<br />
If you are looking for a show that is calm, full of comedy and cute romance, then this show is definitely for you.<br />
Working is a show that was on my PTW list for a long time and recently I finally decided to watch the entire series, and boy, was it a great journey.<br />
The plot is a rather simple one if I could say; a bunch of people working together in a restaurant and the show covers their daily antics and stories. However, the true beauty of the show lies in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328415">
        how it is able to bring out the humor from all the characters in any way.<br />
The strength of this show lies in its characters. I generally do not like too many characters in a show, because as they say too many cooks spoil the broth. That being said, I did not feel anything like that in spite of how many characters there are in the series as pretty much some character supplements another in some way, enriching their overall design. For eg- lets talk about the main couple in the show Inami and Takanashi. Well, in the start both have quite different personalities, Inami being phobic of men in general and Takanashi being someone who just cares about tiny and cute things. However, throughout the show, they change, forming a bond and that just keeps shining as the show progresses.<br />
The show is filled with its funny and cute moments. A1 pictures has once again did a fantastic job of animating the entire series, and the soundtrack more than enough fits the light hearted and adorable scenes of the show.<br />
 Overall, I loved the characters of the show and the accompanying soundtrack. Considering the theme of the show, definitely it does not have much of a story but still is a worthwhile watch if you just have a jolly good time. 9/10

    A comedy of a light humor to spend a pleasant moment, its 3 seasons were undoubtedly very enjoyable, along with its charismatic characters who generated an atmosphere so funny that it was almost impossible to get bored, certainly very good that makes you forget your problems even for 23 minutes.<br />
In the story we are shown how friendships, romances are born and everything that comes with it, basically that was the 3 seasons, and perhaps both the plot and the characters are not deep, they have their own personality, which gives life to the series and I appreciate that it was done that way.

    OH, MY GOODNESS, THIS SEASON WAS SO GOOD-- WHY COULDN&#039;T THE REST OF THE SERIES BE LIKE THIS?? NOW I&#039;M LEFT WANTING MORE BECAUSE IT DIDN&#039;T GET GREAT UNTIL NOW! Seriously, though, this was everything I wanted out of this anime. Let me try and explain through my excitement. <br />
<br />
The story, okay? There... was one. I don&#039;t know how else to tell you, but there was an actual story with this season. No segmented episodes, no pointless plot lines, no lack of character development. Like... there was story to tell throughout this season that I just loved. I was also hoping that I&#039;d finally get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317006">
        to see some serious things happening that weren&#039;t undermined by the constant humor, and guess what? I GOT IT. Guys, I&#039;m so happy. Thankfully, this season did actually bring up some serious topics, which were handled really nicely. Also, between the characters as well, there were both negative and positive developments that we got to see without it, again, being ruined by misplaced humor. So, yes, the story has finally come to fruition. Two seasons of nothing lead to everything happening here, and ya know what? It was awesome.<br />
<br />
SPEAKING of the characters, just YES. I felt like their quirks actually MEANT something, and they didn&#039;t overpower their personalities at all. Besides that though, they *developed.* There was actual, visible progress for many of the characters this season. They had struggles, they questioned themselves, they found happiness, they grew up. I couldn&#039;t have asked for anything more. <br />
<br />
It still has the same, lovable charm it&#039;s always had. It&#039;s extremely funny, the characters are entertaining to watch, and the environment always allows for more content. But this season had all that and *substance* to boot. I don&#039;t know why you&#039;d be here if you haven&#039;t already seen the rest of the series, but if you want to know if it&#039;s worth watching to get here, it is. Getting involved and invested with this series and its characters was so much fun. I&#039;m excited to finish it out because it&#039;s been a wonderful anime to watch. See you at the next!

    And thus, the show of a restaurant full of oddballs (and one normal person) comes to an end. <br />
<br />
...Is what I&#039;d be saying, but there&#039;s a 14th episode.<br />
<br />
Story: Wagnaria&#039;s third season was more of plot developing and tying up loose ends. I felt as if pacing was done right, being the first season where things really started to change. The first and second seasons did their jobs well, but when it came to plot progression, it was much slower with less actual plot. That all left me wanting to watch the next episode until I got to this season, which ended up doing everything I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272951">
        hoped it would. The last episode wrapped everything up well, ending where the manga did. Since that episode is an entire entry in itself, I&#039;ll review it there.<br />
<br />
Art: With a 4 year gap from the second season, the art has been given quite a lot of time to progress and grow from the first two seasons. Everything is more lively, and colours are now even brighter and varied than before. This expressiveness captures the mood and atmosphere of each episode, with effects showing character moods to the best of their abilities.<br />
<br />
Sound: The voice acting has not once became worse throughout this series, and each and every character&#039;s distinct personalities are captured with the acting. Emotions are expressed clearly, and being a plot heavy season, these emotions are conveyed much more than previous episodes. The opening and ending themes are still as always great, and background music captures the moods perfectly. The only downside is that I can&#039;t find sheet music for Taisetsu na Ichinichi. (get on it!)<br />
<br />
Character: The progression of character in Wagnaria S3 is a complete change from the other 2 seasons. The first two did a nice job building the characters up for the events that would occur in this season. Everyone progressed in some way or another by the end, and all relationships are fixed/improved by the end as well. Overall, developments went at a faster pace in this season, and were what I wanted to see.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Season 3 was a real trip from start to finish. It prepared itself in a way that would be an emotional rollercoaster, with internal struggles leading to a resolution with that struggle. Everything was interesting to watch, and enjoyable to see. <br />
<br />
Overall: Throughout this short review, I talked about the change that happened in this anime. I felt that change in pace like that was something that worked nicely in the end. That being said, this anime was a journey from start to finish. I don&#039;t have to tell you to watch this season for you to do it though, so go get on it!<br />
<br />
The review for Lord of the Takanashi will be coming shortly.<br />

    Working!!! (2015)<br />
<br />
I must stand by and point out that I still think the OP from season 1 is the best of the show and the most memorable. That said this season is the most action-packed one and brings it all together and yet they didn&#039;t even finish it since we have a 49 minute or so special that actually will finish the story as a final episode. Regardless it is a real fun ride on this season and you get some real development that has been laid out over a few seasons now. Who knew working part-time at a restaurant could be so fun!<br />
<br />
The art

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399270">
        has improved as with time and although the first season is somewhat timeless and the second one was a bit of a hurdle to pass this one has done an excellent job. <br />
<br />
The OP and ED are great but the season 1 OP still trumps all. Hopefully, it will come back in the final episode. Generally, they do a really great job emotionally with the soundtrack given how realistically awkward characters are. <br />
<br />
The characters this season develop heavily and things start coming to a head. You get a real sense of it actually coming to an end. I still don&#039;t really like the lack of common sense with the Yamada situation especially with how Souma acted and the lack of anyone contacting police etc, especially when you have a boss with such lofty connections. That said it all plays nicely into the story giving it a great time. Aoi Yamada still has an amazing voice actress which is great to see. <br />
<br />
Maya Matsumoto is the still best girl end of the story. Izumi is still great too and look forwards to the maid outfit! Mitsuki Mashiba becomes a strong contender with a great character addition in development. <br />
<br />
As far as enjoyment goes it is a solid 9 since the Souma thing grates me more than I can put into words without writing a book. I would say overall the show has a really great storyline here and it comes to a nice ending once we watch the final special ending episode this will complete a real strong chapter in the anime industry for me. I do worry though that WWW.Working!! won&#039;t stand up to the calibre of this the main show and hope it won&#039;t tarnish this one. <br />
<br />
9/10.
