    A schoolgirl with a giant gun. Got your attention yet? It’s not every day that we get to see a young girl who holds the soul of Oda Nobunaga. More so, how about the concept of monsters known as ‘Evolutionary Invasion Objects (EIO)’ attacking people? To take this premise and formulate it into an anime takes guts. And that’s what Nobunagun tries to do, on first case anyways. But for what’s worth, Nobunagun is just another slapstick attempt to create an anime with an action girl. There’s little taste that is favorable in this show that comes off as a dumb-down shoot fest.<br />
<br />
Taking on the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review146443">
        premise, the show is fairly simple despite the complexity of how it starts out. We have a young girl named Shio Ogura with at tomboyish personality. She is a Japanese high school student who seems to be curious around the world. Unfortunately, she comes off a bit as an outcast with only few friends. From the surface, it’s easy to notice that she is a caring girl but has some strange tendencies. Nonetheless, she enjoys her life just the way it is until the faithful day to Taiwan for a field trip; the day that she will never forget.<br />
<br />
The series takes off with its banal trope involving some sort of invasion by the mysterious Evolutionary Invasion Objects. They come off as creatures taking on abnormal features with bug-like body structures. In retrospect, it is a trite and generic theme as series over the decades have done similar style of presentation. While it’s not a total war on another planet type of story, it still adapts itself as the ‘organization out-to hunt down supernatural creatures’ theme. Meet DOGOO (Defense Organization aGainst Outer Objects), a government agency that trains “E-Gene Holders”, normal humans gifted with special abilities to deal with these EIOs. One unique attribute relating to the E-Gene Holders is the fact that all its users are infused with spirits of historical figures. For Shio, she has the spirit of Oda Nobunaga within her. It matches with her style perfectly considering Shio’s ebullient personality. But for it’s worth, the series embraces on this power to combat the enemy to save humanity.<br />
<br />
Nobunagun would come off as a fun series if it worked itself by character building. Unfortunately, the only characterization features Shio and lesser extent to other characters. The show explores a few type of relationships ranging from professional, caring friendships, and a potential romance. On a professional level, Shio comes off as a clumsy soldier. Despite being dedicated, she makes mistakes and often blames herself for it. Shio’s colleagues often treats her like a kid because her fresh status as an E-Gene Holder. The only development she receives on a professional level deals with the progressive power increase of her abilities. In essence, Shio’s relationship with her colleagues remains vague and lacking. But on a friendship levels, Shio does shine a bit more after saving her fellow classmate, Kaoru Asao. Despite their friendship being a prominent motivation for Shio to fight, their similarities are worlds apart. Asao comes off as a popular girl with an elegant figure enveloped with lady-like manners; the classic Yamato Nadeshiko. Shio on the other hand is the typical klutz with a hotheaded personality and somewhat of a petite figure. Yet somehow, the two fit like two peas in a pod by their strong friendship all after that one faithful day at Taiwan’s field trip.<br />
<br />
Characterization is generalized as being almost insufferable throughout the show. Most characters’ backgrounds are hardly explored. With the show being only one-cour (13 episodes), it lacks many degrees with developing the characters beyond their generic standards. Even Jack the Ripper, a prominent E-Gene Holder holds only the bad boy persona. His relationship with Shio transits into somewhat of a romance although it’s left as a weak subplot. Obviously, the show isn’t a love story considering many circumstances. Even comedic wise, Shio and Asao has some yuri-undertones with their interactions throughout various episodes. Other characters from Shio’s second platoon can only be appreciated for who they are at best with their various behaviors. Haplessly, none of them are really noticeable for their behavior such as the teasing, kissing, and constant silly arguments over little matters.  <br />
<br />
The DOGOO agency is also stereotypical with their projects to annihilate its enemies. While it tries its best to help humanity, the agency also display hypocritical behavior when their own agents cause collateral damage involving casualties. Their image of the pseudo mad scientist gives off a weak impression beyond their motivations. And of course, their characterization is hardly a focus since the show concentrates its story on obliterating the EIO.  <br />
<br />
Action features as perhaps a driving force to motivate viewers to watch the show. Gainax composes the battle sequences but most of it comes off as cheesy and frivolous coordination. It goes full throttle when the battle comes into scenes to demonstrate intensity. But most times, it’s just there. It lacks emphasis, intelligence, and most of all direction. Most episodes have the characters fight for typical reasons such as friendship and survival. Expected would come off as a first word for this type of execution. But really, Nobunagun performs crazily and is all over the place. It doesn’t demonstrate psychological aspects or present any sense of morality. In retrospect, it formulates itself as mindless battles of berserk and flippant execution. <br />
<br />
On a plus note, the show can be fun to watch for its worth. Shio’s a character that can be relatable on some standards and it’s nice to see her change a bit, even if it’s not significant. Comedy also works on numerous occasions with its dialogues. Shio’s face expressions also become an antithesis of the ‘damsel in distress’. She symbolizes a classic tomboy. It’s also memorable to see how such a character can get along with others when they are so different from her in the show. Fanservice is also tolerable on most parts with camera angles focusing on some compromising positions. Skin is generally kept in tone with the characters’ battle outfits rather than portraying it as a sex appeal. Shio doesn’t represent an eye candy in the first place so this works out consistently for her character. In fact, most of the characters in the show feels natural and display who they are rather than hiding it behind like a mask. One other interesting point to note is the way it displays its dialogues through gag bubbles and references. It comes off as a fun device to get viewers into attention.<br />
<br />
Courtesy of animation Studio Bridge, we get its visual aesthetics but only in a few ways. Known recently for its production involving Devil Survivor: The Animation, they demonstrate some acceptable degree of their style. Yet, this might come off with mixed feelings. For one, the animation style feels goofy and amateur. The way it presents its visuals feels like an avant-garde. Its modus operandi composes of oblique structures, amateur character designs, and simplistic backgrounds. The monsters in the show are presented as being acceptingly malevolent. It can draw some attention in but most of the time becomes generic by their mindless behavior. Otherwise, most of the E-Gene Holders display their toughness. And while the show isn&#039;t indulged with fan service, there are some lascivious scenes when it comes to tentacle EIOs. You get the picture...<br />
<br />
Soundtrack comes off as energetic and hyper, perhaps too much. But that’s not necessarily a drawback for this series. In fact, the OST works out best when it’s coordinated with its lively tone. It brings out its dynamics that matches its exuberance. Both the OP and ED song clearly reflects this way with its strong and rapid lyrics. There’s also degrees of calm music during emotional scenes. Character voices such as Shio, Jack the Ripper, and Asao also matches naturally to their persona. Just be ready for the craziness.<br />
<br />
Nobunagan is a show I would watch when I need a dose of energy. The way it comes off is molded with tropes and clichés. Only the main characters stands out the most although a lack of characterization limits their true visage. The story is honest to its premise but the development comes off as dull. However, do expect a mindless ride of fun if you’re in for the full throttle action. It won’t be on a level of TTGL, Kill la Kill, or something you’ll have your eyeballs glued to the screen. Rather, expect a girl packing big guns and some attitude.<br />

    This series is one of the few series that truly stood out when I was making my decisions of what to watch. A fairly normal, typical school girl who has trouble making friends, turns out to be the central role is just fantastic and refreshing.  The way the characters/powers, based off of some of the most infamous, famous persona&#039;s in history, are portrayed in this series is something that I have never seen in any other series. Using these historical figures to inspire the characters or &quot;reincarnations&quot; could prove to be difficult. But it was done extremely well in this case. Being able to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review137901">
        develop the chemistry between the team members, and develop each character so in-depth is just one of the many reasons this series is so great. Other than that, the story and plot are extremely entertaining and unique, and there is a ton of action! Every episode brings about another wave of action and includes some very well placed comedic relief. Lets not forget to mention some of the budding romance, and extreme comradery between some of the said characters that makes for some interesting scenarios and situations. There is indeed some fanservice, which exists in a majority of series these days. But it&#039;s not to the degree that it will overwhelm you. In the end, this series leaves you wanting more.

    Nobunagun is a slightly dark anime where colorful characters kill aliens via power suits while jamming to an engaging OST. <br />
<br />
Main plot of this story comes from these alien invaders known as &quot;Evolutionary Invasion Objects&quot; whose purpose is to slay humanity.The heroes being branded &quot;E-Gene Holders&quot; manifest the spirits of historical figures into a weaponized form (Similar to Shaman King). <br />
<br />
What this anime offers is style &amp; is full of it. Character designs are covered in full body armor each displaying their historic spirit &amp; specific traits which is complimented by the eye catches in each episode. One of the highlights of this series is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review140111">
        how it is &quot;influenced&quot; by several animes of the past or at least can be compared to. One example is the color tone changing similar to Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure&#039;s anime adaptation. Other examples include the invaders being similar to &quot;The Blue&quot; from Blue Gender as they evolve with every encounter.The same can be said to either Shaman King or Fate/Zero due to their usage of historical figures. <br />
<br />
Sadly, the cast is kind of bland leading to a couple of &quot;erotic&quot; moments thrown in just for the hell of it. The lead Sio Ogura is okay as a military otaku who is just quirky character with a few cool moments. I was hoping for more interaction between the host &amp; their spirit which doesn&#039;t really happen until the last episode. <br />
<br />
Being based on a ongoing manga, the anime seems to give an passable conclusion as this series won&#039;t seem to do will if it goes beyond its limit. However, the music for the anime is excellent; being filled with rock &amp; electronic music which suits the semi-hot blooded tone of the show. In other words, Nobunagun  is not the coolest thing ever but at least it knew what it wanted to do; a slightly dark anime where colorful characters kill aliens via power suits while jamming to an engaging OST.

    Nobunagun is one anime that dedicates itself in delivering action.<br />
Personally I think this anime would be more well-liked if it was aired some years earlier.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story (6):<br />
The idea of borrowing the power of historical people is quite promising, however the entire idea of &quot;fighting the invaders to protect the world&quot; is too basic and heavily limits the show&#039;s potential. Though, the invaders&#039; (Evolutionary Invasion Objects) intelligence and tactics used by both parties were something new for me, and kept the show somewhat intense.<br />
<br />
Ogura&#039;s getting influenced by Nobunaga badassery was an eye candy for me (she was the only one though?). Thankfully it wasn&#039;t overused; every scene

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173793">
        that included it was fun till the end.<br />
<br />
On the overall, the series started strong. But nearing the end, if I went to peek at the first two episodes again I would feel that the it has became much less fun than before. I still believe the series has wrapped up really neatly though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters (6):<br />
If I could comment on the character designs, I&#039;d say the writer was being a hipster, giving them designs full of roundness, also resembling what lots of people has said, Megaman...<br />
<br />
Nobunagun has more characters than our usual shows. Adequate explanation and screen time for everyone is difficult to achieve while maintaining their dedicated action time. I&#039;d say that the producers have done a really good job in pacing/balancing action time and introducing/explaining the new/side characters (Commander and First Platoon) given only 13 episodes.<br />
<br />
Regarding character voices, I didn&#039;t have any issues with them. Seeing Ogura&#039;s CV is new, it was pretty good. Only Dogoo and Asao (at the start) had voices that seemed off.<br />
Dogoo.. well seeing his design I guess he&#039;s like a kyubey.<br />
Asao as a character was weird at the beginning, they tried to force her into the story in a manner that didn&#039;t work well for me. All the drama between Ogura and Asao felt off, unrealistic etc, at least at the start.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art (5):<br />
The producers were apparently trying to be different with the art in this show.<br />
The colours of shown in this anime are quite thick and dark, even outside of the battle scenes. I guess it&#039;s the company&#039;s way of suggesting a sinister atmosphere, and unsettling/disturbed air after the EIOs appeared.<br />
<br />
The drawing and presentation of background scenery is more on the simple side, not a lot of budget has been placed on it.<br />
<br />
Also they tried to present something different by using pointers/floating words, pointing out &quot;drooling girl&quot;, &quot;bed hair&quot;, etc, and using flower-patterned or camo-patterned shadows. These &#039;different things&#039; were however inconsistent, shown only at the beginning and sometimes randomly after, which ultimately made them insignificant and irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Despite these downsides, the over all animation is good, even during action scenes. Camera angles/perspectives were fine as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound (7):<br />
Once again the anime tries to be different, this time for the OP. It&#039;s like the studio saying &quot;hey look this isn&#039;t mainstream crap&quot; at your face. Personally, I like the OP though. I think it makes people who like this show like it much more, and likewise, make people who dislike it do so even more. Respect for the dead men! They really mean it, i guess..<br />
<br />
Regarding the OST, some were good others were just normal.. nothing much to say about the OST.<br />
<br />
<br />
---<br />
Nobunagun is a series that I didn&#039;t regret picking up, didn&#039;t regret finishing either. It is underrated at worst, seeing many people have dropped it for the art/design/story. However in terms of story/action presentation I can say that it is better than a lot of other series out there. <br />
<br />
Fanservice is present but very mild, they drew the line well. They know what they were supposed to do. The producers paced episodes well, so there weren&#039;t really much rushes and those stuff. Of course, there&#039;s only a few manga volumes out so I can&#039;t really compare. However I&#039;m appreciative that it ended well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8/10, overall 6.5.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading if you did.<br />

    Anime is a very weird and wondrous thing. One of the biggest things which draws us toward an anime are the stories they are willing to tell that you just aren’t going to see in any other works of fiction. In what other medium are you going to find stories about people creating galaxy-sized mecha out of pure will power alone, or a love story about a young man and—literally—his right hand? The stories of anime are perfect for some and too weird for others.<br />
<br />
So where does Nobunagun, our anime of interest, fit into all this? Well, what’s the plot? <br />
<br />
In this series the personalities

          <span style="display: none;" id="review141647">
        and abilities of influential persons throughout history have been stored and passed down in special genes known as E-Genes. Unbeknownst to her, the young military otaku, Ogura Shio, possesses one such gene deep in her body. During a school trip to Taiwan, freakish insectoid monsters attack her and her classmates. Desperate to save them, the E-gene within her awakens revealing Oda Nobunaga who lends her his power in the form of a massive gun which she uses to eradicate the monsters. <br />
<br />
The monsters, known as Evolutionary Invasion Objects, are being hunted and destroyed by the government agency Dogoo, which finds Ogura and recruits her into their ranks and changes her life forever. <br />
<br />
The plot for Nobunagun is a very standard “military organization beats up the aliens with teenagers with weapons” but with a twist this time. The thing liable to turn away the wandering viewer is the strange concept of the characters using the powers of historical figures as weapons. But let’s make something clear, that concept in and of itself isn’t bad. Weird sure but not instantly bad. The key word here is ‘execution’ and if a show like this were unable to execute that premise correctly, then it would fail at drawing in the larger crowd.<br />
<br />
Does Nobunagun fail? Well, let’s take a closer look at each aspect of this series to find out, beginning with the art style.   <br />
<br />
Nobunagun clearly wants to be experimental and do something different with its art. The series is at its best in its use of lighting, contrast and color to create atmosphere and tone. At times this series can make great use of shadow and blacks against light to add imposing form and weight to the face of a character or the hideous form of an insectoid monster. Another neat but welcome oddity is the series adding fourth-wall-breaking tags to further describe or illustrate a certain thing—for the sake of comedy mostly. Such as in the first scene we have many little letters pointing to our heroine in her bed, labeling her as a drooling and sleeping girl. So this series certainly can’t be accused of being uninventive or boring with its use of color and lighting.<br />
<br />
Without that however, the lazy character designs and crooked, barely-passable animation would become more apparent. During tense action scenes when a tide turning moment is about to occur the series does invest a bit of budget to make it look good, but many of the other monster of the day battles throughout Nobunagun can look very stiff, jerky and worst of all lazily animated. Without the harsh color tone changes during battles to obscure it, it would be much, much worse.<br />
<br />
Another small thing to mention which could be bad or good depending on the person watching, is the unique, Megaman-escque character designs for the battle suits in the show. They can only be described as large limbed, mechanic battle apparel with an almost sailor uniform influence. They are very silly, but a possible acquired taste to most.<br />
<br />
The Evolutionary Invasion Objects are very insectoid or fish-like in appearance and they only really grow from small bugs to bigger bugs. They can serve their purpose as being threatening, and different groups of them find new ways to attack and make use of their powers, but their designs stick within boundaries. However, the implication that these creatures are evolving from primitive life to more complicated and powerful life forms, is a chilling thought.<br />
<br />
Now about the characters. Nobunagun contains a pleasantly full roster of characters, not too big and not too small. Other members of the government agency Dogoo, like Ogura Shio herself, posses the genes and powers of historical figures and manifest this power via external mechanical weaponry.  Some of these members include Jack the Ripper, Isaac Newton, Galileo Galilei, the list goes on. The manifested weapon each character wields is usually relevant to the historical person who they possess the genes of. Such as Jack the Ripper utilizing all forms of blades and knives and Galileo having telescopic vision. Some are kind of on the fence or just in the realm of relevance but the premise is very silly to begin with so accuracy isn’t really a big deal here.<br />
<br />
Each character has their own distinct personality to bring a dash of flavor to the over all package, but at their worst most are flat, undeveloped, one note and defined largely by a single trait or cliché. Because of this, many characters are simple mouth pieces with a small quirk which sets them apart from the other mouth pieces. Such as Isaac Newton likes to kiss people and turns into a bad ass in battle and…? Galileo loves Vidoq and…?  <br />
<br />
This is also the case for Ogura Shio who is very clumsy, excitable, goofy and nerdy (especially about the military things which she enjoys), but she is not a bad person at heart. Despite a few moments of baby-step character progression and a few critical moments in battle where the spirit of Oda Nobunaga helps her kick ass, she is one of the weaker, but not weakest members of the cast because she does not change at all, no matter what she goes through. She is basically the same character she was since the beginning of the series and it can be frustrating when she’s still acting like a clumsy air head after all she’s gone through. By the end of the series, however, her small moments of development do shine through but she still has a long ways to go.  <br />
<br />
The voice actors for the show range from seasoned veterans such as Akira Ishida and Suzuki Tatsuhisa (who do a great job in their roles), to smaller named VAs who still bring voice to their character very well. Being a kind of… underground show as it is, there are, of course flat sounding voices who don’t perform well but they’re reserved for the faceless mooks dying in battle, not the main cast.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the worst offender in the cast is Mutou Shiori who voices the main character herself. This is Shiori’s first role in an anime, and hearing her I’d think it was her first voice acting role period. While her voice fits Ogura Shio’s character, it is very, very flat, unemotional and without tone and she doesn’t really improve throughout the show’s run. It is a very shaky first performance but the actress has potential, and does give Ogura a very normal sounding high school girl voice. Here’s hoping she improves in any future roles she may have.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack of Nobunagun fits this series like a glove. It is diverse, different, but still within a theme. What is that theme? METAL! The wailing and chugging guitars punctuate the combat scenes in this show perfectly, and boil your blood with excitement. But the soundtrack isn’t all head banging and drum smashing. There are orchestral pieces for the emotional moments, and bouncy chiptune-escque bits for the times Ogura is fangirling over military hardware. The shining star of the soundtrack being “Stone Forest Strategy” which is only used once but is definitely a scene that you’re not going to forget any time soon. Much like the art style, but being more consistent and properly executed, it is the best and most fitting aspect of the series.  <br />
<br />
Nobunagun is a bit of a melting pot of experimental ideas in both visuals, audio and plot. Many of these things bring a distinct flavor to the show itself and which differentiates its overused core premise (monsters invading, kill them) from the millions of other anime which have done it. However these small things are not enough to save the series from its biggest handicaps which are poor writing and execution. In one word this series is goofy and plays very much like a lame monster flick. You got your guns, yer fan service, yer explosions, yer cheese. This is not a series meant to be taken seriously, and I feel as though the creators didn’t take it very seriously either. The writing is by no means good, but it’s fun if you turn your brain off for a little while. <br />
<br />
The plot is formulaic, very monster of the day, and the means in which they defeat them always boil down to beating the monster up as much as possible. The enemies slowly get bigger over time, and occasionally they destroy them in slightly creative methods, but the formula stays the same. With a majority of the cast being static, we never feel a sense of fulfillment or progression from these mundane episodes. <br />
<br />
While this show was never meant for main stream appeal, if you want a goofy, cheesy, and fun-stupid anime about people killing giant insects and squids with the power of historical figures. Look no further. <br />

    Ok, I&#039;ve already finish watch this anime for quite some time already, and this is an edited version, co&#039;z a certain muchacho (I&#039;m referring to them mods), wanted me to edit it, so here is my edited review of this not so bad anime. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: Mediocre 5.<br />
<br />
Because, it is basically a run of the mill alien invasion vs, people with special abilities to protect earth, in fact the plot has some similarities with &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; and &quot;Pacific Rim.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: Poor 3.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s with their outfit anyways? Frankly, I kinda find it a too dorky to say the least and whoever wanna do a cos play of them

          <span style="display: none;" id="review140207">
        characters would probably think twice. Ok, let go with Shio&#039;s  combat outfit; I can&#039;t say if she is is wearing a cat suit or was she wearing a tight dress, also her big big gun  was just too dorky, who ever did such poor illustration of her really should have armed her with a minigun, second, Newton&#039;s combat outfit, with one big leg that serves as her weapon of sort, for would be a point where I would wanna kick this series illustrator on his ass, just what was he thinking of giving a hot lady like that such terrible illustration, there was also Gandhi, geeez, having tow big hands as his fighting equipment???????Fuck, he should have just been given the power of telekinesis, frankly with such corny illustrations I would really love to beat the crap out of this series&#039; illustrator.   <br />
<br />
Sound and Enjoyment: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
Well, I kinda like the opening, but not the closing, and I do find Shio&#039;s voice a bit cute and so as Adam&#039;s voice who seemly an epitome of a heroic but mysterious man. Thought, it was a bit of a run of a mill kind of anime it was still enjoyable enough.......only bearly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: Pathetic 1.<br />
<br />
I ain&#039;t gonna mention any of the characters here, all I could say was for the series creator of this thing, he really knows how to desecrate the name of those historical figures, even thought nothing bad was said about them, just using their name is a desecration.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: Good 7.<br />
<br />
Well despite of this anime&#039;s over the top character&#039;s and its run of the mill plot, I think that this anime still deserve a good score, since the action, a couple of comedy and that Adam X Shio moment did provided some entertainment....so should this anime have a season 2????????? Maybe, but for me I just wouldn&#039;t recommend it.<br />

    Nobunagun seemed like a decent anime to watch but one quickly realizes that this is a Horrible anime series. I was unable to complete it since it was exceptionally bad.<br />
<br />
The story was at best ok ( and that is so if you are feeling quite charitable). I mean its a classic story type. Weird good guys fight against the odds to protect the world from alien forces of some type. Pretty cliche but this series managed to fail in the expressing that story. <br />
<br />
Art is something that is quite subjective. Having said that I have to confess that the art here was exceptionally horrible. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review142349">
        backgrounds were poorly made, the characters were trying to be unique something that lead them to look like excrement, the fighting scenes were boring and difficult to follow and in general the whole artistic vision was either lost due to implementation or nonexistant to begin with.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack was pretty boring. Except the opening song, which I found to be quite enjoyable, all the rest of the music was well bellow par. Nothing stood out and nothing seemed to complement the scenes. It was a unique combination of bad art and music.<br />
<br />
The characters were quite ridiculous both in appearance, attitude and personality. Plus the way that they have been set up with their respective powers is quite stupid. Whoever created them must have been bored and uninterested in the end result.<br />
<br />
As you already understand I am unable to write about enjoyment when I am thinking that if I was ever tasked with the duty to torture another human being to extract any information I would probably force him/her to watch this series again and again and again. The term cruel and unusual punishment comes to mind when mentioning this series.<br />
<br />
In conclusion I would not recommend this series to anyone unless you feel you deserve to be punished.

    Nobunagun is an anime that tried hard to be great, but fell short pretty early on. And to my slight dismay, will probably never get another season. <br />
***Spoiler Free***<br />
<br />
Story (7): An eccentric high school girl on a field trip finds herself in the middle of conflict between a shady agency known as DOGOO and a swarm of aliens known as the &quot;Evolutionary Invasion Objects&quot;. As DOGOO is losing, the girl comes into contact with one of DOGOO&#039;s weapon&#039;s and unlocks a power within her long passed down. She turns out to be the reincarnation of a great historical figure, and most of the other MC&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review155303">
        are also reincarnations of thereof. This fact alone made for watching the anime much more interesting, but it never really went anywhere with it. <br />
<br />
Art (5): While it seems to work for this anime, I was never really a fan of heavily color saturated animes. Think of the art style here as a less extreme version of No Game No Life, espcially during the fighting scenes, where they change their entire color template for some reason. The main armor the characters where is very pseudo Megaman and Tron-ish. I was always conflicted with that. <br />
<br />
Sound (6): Really, this anime is lacking in the music department. It&#039;s sountrack is decent at best, albeit it has an amazing opening. The sound effects are great as well. <br />
<br />
Characters (5): At the end of it all, and even before, I never really felt any connection to the characters. They&#039;re all pretty bland and generic. I can sum it down to : The clueless MC, the douche genius, the crazy loli, the horny fanservice, the slacker, the wierdo, and the one guy that&#039;s supposed to be cool. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8): Although Nobunagun is objectively poor, it never really failed to amuse me. Almost every episode was action packed or clean comedy. Even the exposition was entertaining, and some of the best I&#039;ve seen. <br />
<br />
Overall (6): If you like shy, eccentric girls with a huge, pseudo-mini gun for an arm, chances are Nobunagun is for you. Subjectively, this anime is great. It never lets up and always has your attention. It even has a good gore factor. But Nobunagun gets held down by mediocre almost everything. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t tell if this anime was too different, or too original, and that&#039;s why not many liked it. Either way, if fanservice and (actually thoughtful) action is your thing, Nobunagun is waiting. <br />

    Nobunagun is an anime that at first seems simple and already seen a thousand times, but that surprises when the story goes by, in the end you realize the potential it would have had if the series lasted longer.<br />
<br />
Story: (1.25 / 2).<br />
<br />
The story goes from less to more. The truth is that the story, like the characters, starts out looking pretty simple in the first episodes, but with the passage of time you realize that it is not as bad as it seems.<br />
<br />
The first thing that stands out is that the powers are based on great figures from the past from all areas. The enemies,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331446">
        the objects of evolution, although they seem simple, develop the content of the main story, because what in the first episodes looks like they are going to be an increasingly stronger bad guy than the previous one, ends up becoming a story, although not the best in the world, quite entertaining.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: (1.25 / 2).<br />
<br />
The characters are quite stereotyped, and quite simple in general, but also being so many, there are a wide variety of personalities that give a little grace to the series.<br />
<br />
What I like about the characters is the evolution that Shio, the main character, has through the anime. And as I commented in the story, the characters improve over time and develop little by little. You are not going to see anything extraordinary either, but I think that in general it is a series that if it lasted longer could have been much better, because it has stories like Jack the Ripper, Nobunagun or the Commander&#039;s quite interesting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: (0.5 / 2).<br />
<br />
There is little to comment on the art, bad. This is one of those anime where the story or the characters stand out much more than the animation, in this case Bridge, the studio, has not put all its resources into this series.<br />
<br />
The characters are simple to the point, not to mention the combat armor that seems to have been drawn by my little cousin, the same scenarios and objects of evolutionary invasion are even more seedy. Furthermore, the animations in combat are simple and repeated. Perhaps the best are combat vehicles.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: (1.25 / 2).<br />
<br />
Sound is average. Nor are we going to remember Nobunagun with the best soundtrack in history, but it&#039;s not bad. Use an effective music for combat, which gives a sensation of movement, and a calmer one in the moments of pause in the series. In general the sound effects of shots, explosions, etc ..., are good, for this part well.<br />
<br />
The opening although I personally do not like it, I must admit that it goes quite well with the series, action and more action. The ending is average too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (1.75 / 2).<br />
<br />
Nobunagun is one of those series that, despite not having anything special, is quite entertaining. Although the first episodes are somewhat boring, these are improving with the passage of the series.<br />
<br />
An anime of pure action and where each character has its special power, where there are fights each chapter. Being a fairly short series, 13 episodes only, it passes quickly.<br />
<br />
Overall: (6 / 10).<br />
<br />
To summarize a series that is not bad, based purely on action and some strategy. The characters seem very flat but at the end they tell their stories, which begins to make it interesting. It gives me the feeling that with a better art team and a few more episodes it could be a series with potential.

    What I like about Nobunagun:<br />
-NICE BATTLE!!!: there&#039;s a gun, there&#039;s a blade, there&#039;s a barrier, and other types weapon. and the enemy&#039;s power is their number, that is overwhelming, and their ability to evolve fast. oh, well... let me say that again... IT&#039;S NICE!!!<br />
-Nice characters: Sio and Jack (Adam). if you want to know what kind of people they are, you should watch the first battle, since I can&#039;t explain it. but, they have interesting personalities.<br />
-Unique art: well, not really, just something like unique.<br />
<br />
What I dislike:<br />
-Some story of the earlier episodes. Actually, I like simple stories better, that&#039;s why, the not-so-simple story at the earlier

          <span style="display: none;" id="review140577">
        episodes seems bad. and the other reasons is that they messed with the character, this could be my own preference. I don&#039;t hate the story itself, but I just dislike some of the stories at the earlier episodes.<br />
<br />
Neutral:<br />
-Sound: it&#039;s not bad, but, since the battle is good, I want it to be good too, so I imagined the best OST I ever heard when watching the battle.<br />
-Other characters. I don&#039;t hate them, but, I don&#039;t like them as much as the other two above. well, this is just my preference.

    For me, it was one of the best anime that i ever seen.<br />
There is action, romance, sci-fi. The art is not common and the colour are used very well. The story may seem normal or like another anime but it is not. Using famous character from the past and discovering about them is very interessing.<br />
The main character is a nerd about military plane but it made us love her because she is not a weak person. She may seem but is not. In fact, she does not look a like those typical character and that is why the anime is so interesting !!<br />
<br />
Please watched it

     First off, I hate that title. That cutesy little play on words is the reason that something as brain-dead as Sharknado was ever allowed to gain any traction, and now I&#039;m seeing it here. The last thing I need are upcoming anime titles for the next season with pandering, mindless, testosterone-charged names. That being said, Nobunagun is an action show in a market overcrowded with them that is serviceable at worst, but does not one thing to make it really any different from any other title in the modern genre. <br />
 STORY 7: Aliens have invaded and are harboring themselves for a full scale

          <span style="display: none;" id="review138717">
        invasion #2108 for a story premise. These seem to be the kinds of anime I&#039;ve run into since 2001 with shows like Zaion, Blue Gender, Argentosoma, or any other given title where if the antagonists aren&#039;t a bunch of bored-looking shonen villain misfits sitting around a table, then it was just a bunch of insect aliens straight out of Starship Troopers. I will give credit where credit is due, these bugs I actually liked better than the aforementioned shows, as they evolved tactics as the battles waged on (mind you, only because the heroes are complete morons and fight with the same damn battle strategy EVERY single time), but the general feel for even a 13 episode show is &quot;Creatures show up here. You guys go blow it up.&quot; Even towards the end, I never got the feeling it was building towards anything truly climactic. So with villains that offer nothing for the viewer to invest in and barely seem like a threat after the first two episodes, and a team of fighters that just hang around &quot;a place&quot;, the plot was just coasting, hoping to substitute countless action sequences and unfunny comedy instead of writing something to sink my teeth into. Most of my props to towards the original idea of using historical figures as a source of power. It&#039;s a pretty ingenious idea that is grossly miscast with this setting. There could have been a great chance for some social commentary on the state of human affairs (look to your past to solve the problems of the future, or something. Anything other than bug monsters!!) over the selection of these abilities and why the choice of a renegade like Oda Nobunaga to be the leader. <br />
<br />
 ART &amp; ANIMATION 6: It&#039;s about on par with anything else that&#039;s recently come out. Only during the many, many, many hack&#039;n&#039;slash gun battles does the scenary will switch into this negative filter when the AU balls are activated. It&#039;s never explained why, and I just found it to be distracting. Some of the CGI is used subtly and cleverly, like with Ghandi&#039;s barrier (which is what it is, you jackass! Stop throwing a fit when someone calls your barrier a &quot;barrier&quot;. What do you prefer, Ice Cream Rain Dance?? Cotton Underpants!?!).<br />
 The character designs look dated to me. I&#039;ve seen these comedic facials, hairstyles, and visual gags for eight years now. At least each character looks distinct enough and I can tell them apart when they are wearing their uniforms as opposed to 300 generic faces all wearing Soul Reaper garb. The AU Ball outfits, however, leave a little too much to be desired. Preferably, Jack The Ripper, who is bearing the essence of an infamous serial killer and is supposed to be the series&#039; resident badass, but looks like he&#039;s dressed in Rini&#039;s Sailor Scout shirt with puffy shorts!! If you&#039;re dressed like that, you BETTER kill someone.<br />
<br />
 SOUND 4: That opening theme is horrendous! Sounds like some crappy, rejected Nu Metal that plagued the United States in the early 2000&#039;s. Ogura Sio spends all of her not-action scenes talking faster than Shia LaBeouf after snorting his own body weight in cocaine and then walking on the set of Revenge of the Fallen. Everyone else sounds bored.<br />
<br />
 CHARACTERS 4: Nearly the entire cast of Nobunagun is littered with everything that drives me crazy about anime (save Asao, she is a sweetheart, which is why she&#039;s kept out of the show)) None of these characters have a personality trait outside of their casted roles. While I think it&#039;s cool that a female is the lead and isn&#039;t a total moron, she has nothing else about her other than her knack to prattle on constantly about military arsenal! And that really is about it with her. Jack could&#039;ve been a great comedic foil, but instead he just kind of stands there acting stoic. Jess has boobs and collagen lips, Ghandi is allegedly that soft-spoken one, but is a creep for no real reason, Galileo is the twerpy school girl, and Voldicq is the cold, Vulcan-like strategist who favors calculated results over human emotions. I just described the main cast in all the detail the series provided me with in two sentences. Outside of the fact that they are all one-dimensional cookie-cutter archetypes, I doubt they would hang out with each other if they weren&#039;t forced into close quarters. It&#039;s like someone paid them to act chummy. At least Asao is pleasant when she&#039;s present.<br />
<br />
 REWATCH VALUE 5: At 13 episodes, it&#039;s a breeze to watch, but I don&#039;t think there was a particular point that would make me want to revisit the show. It&#039;s an easy enough for viewing pleasure if episodes of another show you might be watching isn&#039;t available yet. Comes off as a good starter series for someone just getting their feet wet in anime.<br />
<br />
 OVERALL 6: As I have been trying to get back into the swing of watching newer anime on a regular basis after having a meltdown with the medium two years ago, an easy going action title like this one might have been what the doctor ordered. It has some missed potential with the concept behind the powers of prominent historical figures being used to thwart evil. Faceless alien invaders are just the wrong kind of villain for this and they should&#039;ve battled someone(s) attempting to exploit these abilities. So while it may sound like I shredded this show completely, it isn&#039;t as bad as I initially thought, but it isn&#039;t as good as it could have been.<br />
<br />
PROS: Nobunaga fighting aliens with a gatling gun.<br />
<br />
CONS: Very underwhelming overall. Bland as all hell characters. That old lady is a terrible person.

    The Story  was wonderful all around, not the best one mind you, but it was good.<br />
<br />
I have seen only the anime, so my review is based on the Anime. <br />
<br />
= What I liked =<br />
- How they applied each of the Historical Figures Aspects to their weapons and such. <br />
- How Well they portrayed Nobunaga Oda and the Main Protagonist.<br />
- How they portrayed most of the characters really and their abilities... matched well.<br />
- The Storytelling, and how it kept my attention. <br />
- How the Enemies were not pushovers, reminded me of Dark Souls for a bit on that part... underestimation will get you hurt.<br />
- The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review197955">
        Military Geeking.<br />
- Badassery<br />
- Jack the Freaking Riper :3 <br />
- How they left us hanging wanting more<br />
- Shio&#039;s badass Smile when it is real Game time. <br />
<br />
= What I didn&#039;t like =<br />
- Minimoto Musashi should have been in this anime too.<br />
- How they left it open for a second season. <br />
- Asao and Shio needed more Relationship development time<br />
- Again, leaving us hanging.... I am sure others want more content too :3<br />
- Not giving us enough background on the Dogoo... what is it anyways?<br />
- Not Giving us Background on Germain... What is he?<br />
<br />
All in all, it left me wanting more, I hope there will be a Second Season or a Reboot depending on how old this anime is. <br />

    This was amazing, it was engaging with all the action and the characters where funny and wonderful so every episode made you just want to keep watching and never stop.You couldn&#039;t have asked for a better anime.The story was good and progressed well (i think there where some filler episodes or maybe there where there for you to get to know the characters more, I&#039;m not sure.) however i would have liked to learned more about the souls/DNA of the people inside them and how that hole thing works because that still confuses me a-little but it is fine how it is I would just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review238141">
        have liked to know more.  I hope that they make a season 2 soon because it will be epic. Though i have to say one thing the last episode did not feel like a season finally it felt like just like an end to a normal episode but it was still a really good episode, that is all i will say about. Seriously one of the best anime iv ever seen :)

    This is a fun little show. Nothing special, but not offensively bad either.<br />
<br />
The story is a typical &#039;teenager with magical powers saves the world&#039; tale. It doesn&#039;t really do anything new, but it&#039;s a good enough base to build off of.<br />
<br />
The characters are surprisingly engaging for such a silly light hearted show. The protagonist is fine, a bit bland, but with enough personality to qualify as the main character. <br />
<br />
Although none of the supporting characters are amazing, they are all memorable and some slightly subvert expectations, which is always welcome. You can believe that they have lives outside of the story that is being told.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252365">
        The powers that the characters have are also a little bit different and interesting.<br />
<br />
The show&#039;s style is silly, but distinct and deliberate, and I think that it works. The overall quality seems to be lacking the &#039;smoothness&#039; that nicer looking shows have, and the character designs are a bit exaggerated and bizarre. However, it all feels right.<br />
<br />
Although I wouldn&#039;t go out of my way to recommend this to anyone, I wouldn&#039;t discourage anyone from watching it either.
