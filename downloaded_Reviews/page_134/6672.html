    Frame Arms Girl is an advertisement. It exists for one reason and one reason only, to sell those toys. But in that, there is magic that can happen. For the process of selling toys is not a simple one. Toy line anime can&#039;t work like normal commercials. They can&#039;t just shove in the product in the viewer&#039;s face and yell at the top of their lungs, &quot;BUY OUR TOYS!&quot; They have to make them special and appealing. They have to draw the viewer into the world of the toy and get them to want them. And it is this mindset that makes Frame Arms Girl

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250394">
        work.<br />
<br />
In the case of Frame Arms Girl, it isn&#039;t a show that wows the viewer with any part of itself. While the animation can look spectacular at times, it&#039;s only in comparison to the 3D models that really it shines. What Frame Arms Girl does really well is making itself as fun as it can. It splits its episodes into two parts and each part has it&#039;s own little skit that it does. This can range from a whole variety of topics and each of them is given a flavour that goes with the theme of the frame arms girls. The unconventionalness of the toys allows them to tackle the settings of the parts in a unique way, creating an experience that sets it apart from other shows. While the parts do have borrowed some tropes from Western animation it does so in a way that enhances the show and enables it to be kept fresh. Furthermore, in these skits it allows itself to go in a natural yet unpredictable way, favoring the story in a nice way. And even more than that the show also likes to pull out an occasional surprise episode that shows the full creativity of the team that writes the show.<br />
<br />
The characters are not groundbreaking but they are fun. They don&#039;t have much depth but they aren&#039;t restricted just to a gimmick. While they all have their first and foremost personality traits, they have other traits that they exhibit and do feel like organic characters, even if they are toys. This ability allows them to feel fresher and more original even if they don&#039;t stray too far from conventional archetypes. The best of the lot is Ao, the main girl, who is a very relatable. Not only does she stray from any archetype but she acts in rational ways that are easily understood. Her intentions aren&#039;t always pure, nor does she care only about the toys with a heart bigger than a thousand suns like we&#039;d expect from the main character. Rather her love for the toys is built slowly with time, in a realistic manner. <br />
<br />
The sound quality is pretty good overall, it&#039;s nothing special but can certainly add to the battles and SOL. Oh did I mention, there are some cool battles!? While I&#039;m not the biggest fan of action or mech battles, the mix between mech battles and fluffy daily life episodes makes for an interesting and fun combination that is rare to find.<br />
<br />
Frame Arms Girl first and foremost is a toy commerial. But it&#039;s a pretty good one that just wants to have some fun. And for that I think it&#039;s a really good watch.

    TL;DR Section at the end of the review. This review may or may not contain minor spoilers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#039;ve come to realize that emotions aren&#039;t something you learn – they have to be experienced.&quot; —Gourai<br />
<br />
Frame Arms Girl (F.A. Girl) is a show that had potential to be something great, but unfortunately fell short.<br />
<br />
Ao Gennai receives a package from her father one day, which it&#039;s contents are revealed to be Gourai, a Frame Arms Girl. From here, their friendship grows as Ao teaches Gourai the variety of emotions humans feel. Along the way, they meet many friends and foes alike.<br />
<br />
This story and setting had vast potential to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250391">
        something so beautiful, but it ended up turning out poorly. Not only is writing fairly subpar, all the characters are really flat (in more ways than one). They each have the unique trait (Gourai is a hard worker, Jinrai is way too into ninjas, Base is childish, Materia twins are cunning and suggestive, etc etc) but it doesn&#039;t go any farther than that, with the exception of Ao and Gourai. The show is based around these two and their relationship, but it really feels like you&#039;re just watching a small robot learn to express emotion, which is pretty bland most of the time.<br />
<br />
F.A. Girl constantly switched between 2D and 3D aspects, along with showing a lot of 2.5D shots. This worked for and against it, with the majority being against, unfortunately. Every now and then, they&#039;d have a well animated scene (some fight scenes, like Ao / Jinrai vs. the Materia twins), but then other times it just felt awkward and out-of-sync (the finale live show in the last episode).  As for the soundtrack, there&#039;s nothing really going for or against it. Both the OP and ED aren&#039;t awful, but there are plenty of other better ones. <br />
<br />
TL;DR: F.A. Girl had the potential to be a great show, but didn&#039;t quite make it by a rather large margin. While there were some nice scenes and times where the show was enjoyable, you wouldn&#039;t miss out on anything should you choose not to watch.

    Frame Arms Girl began as a standard snap fit model kit line made by Kotobukiya, featuring Armored Girl versions of their Frame Arms line. Now, despite being a little small for a figure line, Frame Arms Girl is one of the most popular model kit lines Kotobukiya has ever made, gaining a huge fanbase and a lot of buyers. So naturally due to it&#039;s success, they take pride and confidence in their creation.<br />
<br />
Now, of course, it&#039;s lowkey obvious that this line really appeals to otakus, with them being model kit girls and all, not to mention all the showing skin and fanservicey bits. Yet anything

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250448">
        can become more popular with the right exposure, and what&#039;s a good way to increase the huge popularity to otakus?<br />
<br />
By making a TV show out of it of course.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
<br />
The story of FA Girl is both simple and non existent. We&#039;re introduced to our female protagonist Ao Gennai, who is pretty much your standard high school girl living alone in her apartment alone. One day, a strange little box arrives on her doorstep, and opening it, she finds a little figure of a girl sitting in there with runners. Accidentally activating the figure, we are introduced to Gourai, a brand new model of Frame Arms Girl. Soon, more different types of FA Girls start arriving and Ao&#039;s house, the reason being that Ao&#039;s Gourai is the only one running, and the company who makes FA Girls want to collect data on Gourai from her. To do this, they send other FA Girls to Ao&#039;s house so that they can battle Gourai to collect combat data, in turn, Ao gets paid for her &quot;efforts&quot; for that. Simple concept right? Well the anime actually doesn&#039;t always focus on this aspect. <br />
<br />
Each episode is divided into two sessions, with a story taking place in each. Only about a third of these sessions contain battles, and they aren&#039;t really exciting or time consuming either. Outcome is painfully predictable for almost every battle (hint: Gourai is the main character), and the rest of it is slice of life/random mayhem with FA Girls. It&#039;s not a very cohesive plot by any stretch, as it&#039;s mostly just that slice of life show where the characters have dumb fun with each other, and that&#039;s pretty much it. However one might be able to find some charm in these dumb misadventures that these characters take part in. <br />
<br />
There is also some bits of interesting areas for those that are fans of either model kits or FA Girls. Other than the blatant advertising of Kotobukiya and their products, the show has bits where they teach you the basics of building model kits, as well as how they are made, which can definitely add a unique sort of appeal to the model kit builders like me out there.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
<br />
The art is a little bit on the interesting side. One of the first things people will notice is the use of CGI animation for all the FA Girls. Now while I don&#039;t mind CGI animation if it isn&#039;t horrible (which it really isn&#039;t here in my opinion), I am aware that some people might not be fans of the CGI animation is used in the show. Now personally, I think it blends in quite decently into the 2D animation, and one positive I think the CGI has is that it gives the FA Girls make them look more like the plastic mechanical beings they are, instead of something that looks &quot;human&quot;. Another unique trait with some of the CGI is that the 3D rendered battle environments actually look like a real 3D rendering, for better or for worse. Some areas of really good use of the CGI animation would be the &quot;armor up&quot; sequences of the FA Girls, which are both fun to watch, and have a lot of movement too.<br />
<br />
Now, while the CGI is used quite a bit, and actual animation is quite average in most areas, when the show tries to animate well, the animation can actually be quite impressive. Take for instance the second version of the OP, where they replaced the CGI animation with more standard 2D animation, and in all honesty, the result is almost astounding. Lots of minute details like shading is done surprisingly well, movement is also both really fluid and plentiful in a few areas. For a good example of what I mean, pay attention to the hair of FA girls in that OP, the animation is both clean and plentiful, everything moves and it&#039;s almost sakuga. So while overall animation is just passable or standard with CGI, when the studio does try to animate well, they can really make some magic. A bit of a shame that it wasn&#039;t the mainstay throughout the show, but despite this missed potential, i&#039;m happy with what we got.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
<br />
The sound does the job, but nothing really stands out to an extreme. Most sound effects and folley are well done, with bits reused here and there, but nothing really sounds bad. While some things like Gourai&#039;s tank treads sounds more like a toy car than a plastic tank rolling around, other sound effects like Stylet and Baselard&#039;s flying, and the effects in the armor up sequences do their job well. <br />
<br />
The OP and ED are both nice, both sounding happy and upbeat, matching the tone of the show. There isn&#039;t really a lot of &quot;dramatic moments&quot; in this series, it&#039;s mostly quite relaxed, and the OST matches these fun little moments with little tunes and jingles. However for the moments that do have some form of impact, they do have OST that fit the bill, and overall the sound is good for the show.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
<br />
Now, the thing about most of the characters in this show is that asides from Ao and Gourai, each character follow a single one dimensional trope or personality type, and they embody it completely. We have some of the very common ones like Stylet the tsundere and Architect the robotic kuudere, but at the same time there are some of the more bizarre tropes in the mix, an example being Jinrai as the girl completely absorbed by feudal japan culture and style.<br />
<br />
Ao and the FA Girls pretty much make the entire cast alone, with only the minor exception of Bukiko as the recurring sidekick best friend. Otherwise there are barely any other characters or even people&#039;s faces seen. We don&#039;t even get to see the face of the Building Manager, who is not only best character, but is also a god with an infinite supply of love and happiness. Bless you building manager, bless you. <br />
<br />
Something interesting we do see in terms of characters is that we can see growth in Gourai as she learns more about human emotions. As her own love for her friends and Ao grow, she also grows as a character to shape her own personality and become a person of her own, and that was really nice to see from this show. It was honestly one of my favorite aspects in terms of the characters, and a breath of fresh air with the rest of the one dimensioned quirky cast of a slice of life anime, aside from our lord and saviour the Building Manager of course.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
<br />
While I didn&#039;t necessarily enjoy the show as much as I would&#039;ve liked myself, I cannot bring myself to say that it wasn&#039;t an entertaining ride. It certainly was a bit of a nice little way to pass the time, and for fans of frame arms girls, you&#039;ll probably enjoy it. It&#039;s a dumb fun little slice of life show with geeky model kit humour and facts thrown into the mix. It&#039;ll certainly appeal to both those who enjoy slice of life shows and maybe to those who are fans of Frame Arms Girls.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m personally not usually a fan of slice of life, and that played a role in my overall enjoyment. But despite this, seeing the characters interact with each other was amusing to watch despite my usual disinterest in the genre, so this might appeal to fans of the genre even more. Alas, this is my review and I have to review it how I see fit, and personally i&#039;m not a huge fan of the whole slice of life thing. In the end, what kept me most interested were the Frame Arms Girls themselves who I personally really find charming.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
<br />
Frame Arms Girl is overall is just a really average show in almost all aspects. It does not aim to exceed any expectations, and in the end it&#039;s just one huge advertisement for the Frame Arms Girls line, and in the end that&#039;s all it is. But does it stand up as a show on it&#039;s own overall? Honestly I think it does. Some will not like it, it&#039;s got no real sense of true plot, and it&#039;s really just slice of life misadventures and mayhem with the Frame Arms Girls, however personally I found this show to be uniquely entertaining in a way compared to other slice of life that i&#039;ve seen.<br />
<br />
The characters, while mostly one dimensional and simple, are charming once you get used to them and hang around them more. They have unique charms and quirks to them, and it&#039;s entertaining to see them mess around with their misadventures and days together. The actual battles aren&#039;t very great, they are both too short and too uneventful to really extract true enjoyment out of it, but it&#039;s more about the dumb fun that these characters have, mixed with model kit know-how is what gives the show it&#039;s unique charm. This show will appeal to fans of FA Girls and to those of the slice of life genre. While it has it&#039;s issues like the CGI animation, mostly one dimensional cast, and lack of any truly exciting or even good battles, the show is still a nice watch and an entertaining way to pass the time, especially if you&#039;re a fan of model kits or FA Girls.

    Frame arms girl is a wonderful, relaxing Anime, and made me smile! (hoping for season 2)!!!!<br />
<br />
Love everything about it, even though some fan service was kinda....yeah.<br />
<br />
This was just wonderful! 10/10 all!<br />
<br />
I love all the characters!<br />
<br />
Even though I usually just give 10/10 to anime that give me the feels, and makes me imagine myself in the Anime, I gave this an exception for an 10/10!<br />
<br />
I have no dislikes about this Anime! <br />
<br />
I recommend this Anime to anyone, no matter what your likes are, I guarantee you will like this. (Okay I am someone who like mostly like all genre&#039;s, so I watch basically any Anime, that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257022">
        is why I recommend this)!<br />

    In accordance with the ‘three episode rule’, this show just saved itself at the last minute. Some may already be put off by the slow start. Episode 1 &amp; 2 aren’t lively and there’s a lot of stiff scenes. Even episode 2 part B is already a filler. But thankfully, the third episode turns out to be much more promising than the earlier ones. It introduces us two (or three) more lively characters which will definitely expand both the story and the enjoyment much more.<br />
<br />
The animation concept is interesting yet is still glitchy (very apparent in the first episode) with the F.A. Girls are animated

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246102">
        in CGI/3D but the rest (our human MC and the backgrounds) is in the usual 2D. Sometimes the CGI is so smooth like in the opening and subsequent battles (primarily episode 3).<br />
<br />
The background soundtrack didn’t stand out very much and the volume is sometimes too low to be able to make the atmosphere. The ED is catchy though.<br />
<br />
Looking at the final line up of the F.A. Girls, there should be a good number of personalities so it might be a wild ride after all of them are introduced. The existence of fanservices so far is still at a decent and acceptable amount.<br />
<br />
If you’re either a mecha fan, looking for an action anime, or just want to see cute (miniature-sized android) girls then just give this anime a shot! It’s promising enough if they keep pumping out episodes like the third one.<br />

    Frame Arms Girl is a trendy advertising series wrapped in a nice slice-of-life mecha-mix that tries in a very traditional way to make the audience want to buy these cute little model girls.<br />
<br />
Story: thin and a pretext to show the little girls with heavy armament (4/10)<br />
In a near and peaceful future, teenage girl Ao accidentally receives a Frame Arms Girl (Gourai). This is the prelude to a simple slice of life mecha mix with a bunch of tiny cute AS (=artificial self). In other words, we get to accompany a small group of cute android girls in heavy armor on their adventure forays. We learn

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327979">
        how Gourai and her friends / enemies, other cute little humanoid robots with the intellect of a 10-year-old and the ability to learn, assisted by their master Ao manage the small and big adventures of everyday life. The low rating for the story and plot is not due to the fact that it feels like a déjà-vu, but because it is an unspectacular copy and less entertaining than &quot;Busou Shinki and the Arnval Mk.2&quot;. Again a peaceful future, the adventures of the girls have changed a bit and the gender of the protagonist has changed from male to female, a few more gimmicks like smartphone, email, spam folder and a virtual &quot;thunder&quot; dome (= battle stage) for the girls&#039; fighting sessions.<br />
I was wondering why the gender of the toys wasn&#039;t changed as well. Just make a series, more for the female audience? Nope, and therefore an unspectacular copy.<br />
<br />
Characters: new models and weapons, but the same personalities (4/10)<br />
Characteristics of the Frame Arms Grils are the same as in Busou Shinki. There is a slight modification to the figures, e.g. twin models have been added, so that at least a small variation is visible. The girls are pretty, and even the one with the eye patch is kind of &quot;cool&quot; - god Lord, give me a choice for another adjective than &quot;cute&quot; ... xD<br />
Gennai, Ao:<br />
The high school girl is the master of the small clique and not involuntarily when she realizes that the field study with the Frame Arms Girls is paid. She is a typical teenage girl with parents who work abroad. She basically knows nothing about the Frame Arms Girls, weapons, and Factory Advance that has send the models. This way, her character is nicely different from her best friend Bukiko. However, with the receipt of the package, her typical teenage life will be turned upside down. And the devil said:<br />
&quot;Look, but don`t open it!  Open it, but don&#039;t touch!! Touch, but don&#039;t push any buttons!!!&quot;  Well, transparent what happens next, isn&#039;t it ;)<br />
Gourai:<br />
She is the first Frame Arms Girl to arrive at Ao and she represents the Loyalty, a nice mix of soldier, servant and tank. Faithful, kindheartedly somewhat naive and armed with a variety of weapons such as knive, bazooka and pistol, as well as the small plus of caterpillar treads, on which the approximately 12 inch tall Belle with blonde hair and sparkling turquoise eyes, rides through her battles as if on rollerblades.<br />
Stylet:<br />
She is the next cutie who loudly enters the stage. Her long blue hair turns violet at the end, and in addition to her energetic demeanor, she is equally equiped with weapons, like e.g. a smart gun, missiles, large gatling gun, a sword and twin tails, as well as a back booster and the ability to fly. She is quick-tempered and always ready to rumble. Her tsundere personality, magically attracts the sadistic side of the Materia twins and makes Stylet the subject of most of the teasing by the black/white-devils.<br />
Baselard:<br />
The white-haired girl followed immediately, a little quieter than Stylet. But she is a sly one and is armed with 4 pistol-apoints and shooting shields and also has the ability to fly. She is smart and knows how to use it, but on the other hand she is childish and easy to take by surprise  if you know how to do it. All in all, the tiniest of the Frame Arms Girls is quite a troublemaker and loves shiny things.<br />
Kotobuki, Bukiko:<br />
She is Ao&#039;s closest friend and a little genius, together they are a fun duo, both in conversations and in joint activities. For example, when it comes to re-catching a Frame Arms Girl romping around and stealing glittery things. She&#039;s a geek when it comes to model kits, and she&#039;s excited when she realizes that Ao has some Frame Arms Girls. She tells Ao a lot about model kits and even builds a weapon for Gourai. She&#039;s funny and a real buddy type.<br />
Materia-twins:<br />
Next, the Materia twins Kuro and Shiro take the stage. You can best describe them with the words: wolves in sheep&#039;s clothing. Whether you like them or not is a matter of taste, as are their weapons. Kuro uses the Grind Circle, a round sword with shark-toothed blades all around. A weapon that is as practical as it is dangerous. For long-range combat, the G-circle can be thrown like a boomerang and for close combat, the Circle can be divided into two half-bow swords. Shiro wields the Beastmaster sword, which can be used like a blade whip. All in all, the two are serious opponents, and the way they behave and fight leaves no doubt that they are a little bit sadistic.<br />
Jinrai:<br />
A new episode and a new challenger - Jinrai. The new opponent or companion appears even louder than Stylet. She has a fun way of looking at everything from a medieval samurai&#039;s perspective, but that makes her quite likeable, even if it&#039;s a strong cliché. However, Jinrai is the ninja among the Frame Arms Girls and an expert in sneaking up on people, and close combat. She is an absolute geek when it comes to traditional Japanese stuff, which sometimes leads to the fact that her mindset doesn&#039;t quite fit into modern Japan. It&#039;s very simple and clichéd comedy but you have to laugh anyway.<br />
Architect:<br />
Actually, the Frame Arms Girl named architect was originally planned without a body. A virtual girl who first appears on the Battle Stage in the fight between Gourai and Jinrai in Episode 5. It was a fateful encounter and, as Ao said, the last empty &quot;apartment&quot; is like a red flag. Not surprisingly, Ao gets another package with Architect. Unlike the other girls, Architect has no emotions. However, she has the ability to search for information online, a walking dictionary, so to speak. She is able to multiply herself, or to transform into another frame arms girl.<br />
Hresvelgr:<br />
Finally, Hresvelgr takes the stage in episode 7. She&#039;s a tomboy, unfortunately also a bit of a tyrant and a mean. She loves to fight, but is a bad loser. So it&#039;s good for her that she has access to all data sent to the Factory Advance database, so she knows practically all the strengths and weaknesses of the other girls. She can fly and is also the deadliest girl when it comes to a fight.<br />
<br />
Visuals: decent, but not outstanding for an 2017 anime (6/10)<br />
The art is neat, nothing special, but not bad either. The mix of D2 and CG is fine here, because mainly the Frame Arms Girls are created with CG, while the people are drawn in a classic way. Even if CG isn&#039;t my cup of tea, it is not so out of place in the field of robots or humanoid androids. What I noticed very positively is that chibi and super-deforming elements are rarely used, mostly as a style element for the visualization of ED, and also a little bit in episode 7, where I think it fits quite well. <br />
The animation is also at a decent level, but it&#039;s not outstanding for a 2017 anime either. The arming of the girls and the presentation of the weapons are good. The use in the fight scenes is successful, even if the total number of fights is somewhat low. All in all, the animation is decorative, but overall I was more fascinated by the weapons, the fights and the related animation in Busou Shinki.<br />
<br />
Sounds: Business as usual, but pretty well implemented (7/10)<br />
The sound devison appears as the best part of the show. The music does not try desperately to be more than pleasant background music. The OP &amp; ED sound like typical idol songs, but that&#039;s fine for the show.<br />
The OP &quot;Tiny Tiny&quot; is sung by Murakawa, Rie. A voice actress and singer from the Saitama Prefecture. The OP is an cheerful J-Pop song that, even if typical, is nice to listen to and you automatically turn up the volume.<br />
The ED „Fullscratch Love“ is preformed by the Frame Arms Girl`s seiyū. Whether someone likes it or not depends on personal taste. If you don&#039;t like all the voices of the dubbing actors, you won&#039;t really like the song either. The music is not badly chosen for the genre and fits both the musical composition and the lyrics. However, the singing is a matter of taste. <br />
I didn&#039;t notice anything special about the sound effects, neither negative nor positive.<br />
On the other hand, I was more positively surprised by the voice actresses than I expected. Many of them haven&#039;t worked as seiyū for long, so they&#039;re inexperienced but very talented. Hikasa Youko, on the other hand, is more experienced, and that is striking. Her performance as Gennai Ao&#039;s voice was great. Well balanced and easy to understand even in faster dialogues, clear and with a very suitable feminine, youthful note in her voice. I really liked it and it was fun listening to her. Yamamura Hibiku, who gives Architecto her voice, is similarly good and also an experienced seiyū. She has expressed the rather cool, emotionless language, which conveys exactly the character as mechanical and programmatic, very well. I also liked the voices and portrayal of Kabamaya Minami as Jinrai and Kaho Narumi as Gourai. On the one hand, Jinrai as a geek, who is always besides herself with joy, when it comes to medieval Japan. Beautifully presented and very amusing to hear. In addition, Kaho Narumi expresses very well that Gourai as Android really tries to understand human emotions and not just imitate them. In my opinion the voice acting improve the overall picture of the sounds, so that my rating for this topic: a good 7/10 instead of a weak 6/10.<br />
<br />
The anime wasn&#039;t a complete disappointment, but I&#039;m not really happy either. For action fans, the fights are not spectacular enough and there are too few. The Slice of Life element runs alongside almost unnoticed, so SoL fans won&#039;t really enjoy it. I precieved the series to be a little less entertaining compared to Busou Shinki. However, those who like the genre, surely want to catch a glimpse of Frame Arms Girls. I would not recommend it to anyone else.<br />
<br />
As always, thanks for reading.

    About the art: I know people who hate 3D anime... I also prefer 2D over 3D, but in this anime, the 3D scenes are well used and the FAGirls look really close to the actual figures from Kotobukiya. The fighting-action scenes that are in 3D, look seriously good too, especially the &quot;transformations&quot;. Btw, only the FAGirls are in 3D... the rest of the anime is 2D and looks great too!<br />
<br />
The story (so far) isn&#039;t anything super special with crazy plot twists, but that&#039;s really not the main focus in this anime: it&#039;s all about &quot;cute tiny aho girls doing cute tiny aho things&quot;. It doesn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249180">
        NEED a complicated story.<br />
<br />
All in all it&#039;s a very entertaining comedy anime with adorable characters and good directing. There are also other factors which are a matter of taste (like some jokes, fanservice, logic, and some background information about how model kits are made). There&#039;s pretty much no romance, but some nice relationships and character developments... very cute &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
The music is nice, the transformation/battle theme reminds me of Megaman X games... maybe? The opening is catchy! There are 6 or more different versions of the ending, for example in one episode it&#039;s sung only by Baselard and Materia. The voice acting is awesome: my favourite is Baselard who has a cute annoying voice xD ...I hope the seiyuu gets more roles!<br />
<br />
The anime may have attracted some serious mecha/action fans who were expecting something else... but judging the anime for what it actually is, and as a fan of mecha AND comedy anime, I think it&#039;s a 10! ...and I&#039;m already watching the first 8 episodes again.

    this is my first impression for this show and my first review.<br />
you can watch it and don&#039;t want to shoot the gun in you head. and that what i can think about this first episodes of this series.<br />
this anime is base on Frame Arms Girl model kit. and that right it a moe model so if you love cute girls in armor. you may find some enjoyment from this show.<br />
Story : 6<br />
if you had Gundam Build Fighters mix with Busou Shinki and litter bit of K-on and remove what all the thing that make them special out of it and you will get this anime.<br />
<br />
Art

          <span style="display: none;" id="review245400">
        : 6<br />
it not bad to look at but it is nothing special and CGI is not bad but it one thing i can&#039;t stand for in this anime. This is 2017!!! why CG from Busou Shinki Anime from 2012 and LoveLive!! from 2013 has better CG for some reason it unacceptable. it make the show look cheap and out date<br />
<br />
Sound : 5<br />
it not annoying OP song and I like END song a little bit but again nothing special about it. sound effect is not bad and mediocre at best.<br />
<br />
Character : 5<br />
here is what your get (for now)<br />
1. Ao Gennai = Master the owner of Frame arms girls <br />
2. Gourai = main girl who has deadpan face<br />
3. Stylet = angry piss off girl<br />
4. Baselard = sleepy girl<br />
what sad about this is all of them is cardboard cut out from batter show like i said before. and no new model at all. Gundam Build Fighters and other gundam show all way have new model to make me say : take my money bandai!!! but here nope here a model you already build and see hope you happy.<br />
GundamStarBuildStike model kit that don&#039;t have AI mind you have more personality then Gourai AI that have Logic of 10 years olds girl...........<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 7<br />
For broken wallet otaku like me. who love Gundam and FA Girls i got to say it not bad it better then some show like Accel World and all other Moe trash you can find all year and everywhere.<br />
<br />
Overall : 6<br />
i look forward to this show when it announce. and i think of Busou Shinki mix  with Gundan Build Fighters. but what i got is Busou Shinki mix Gundan Build Fighters try....... so just low your expectation and you get Busou Shinki all over again without what make it special.

    this is weird<br />
<br />
I thought it was a PR stunt that ran for 12 episodes; then at the end there&#039;s a cliffhanger WTF  <br />
(＃`Д´)<br />
<br />
lemme get this out there though; IT IS A &#039;PR&#039; STUNT (￢_￢)<br />
<br />
first of all, no base story line whatsoever; it revolves around an all female cast (which doesn&#039;t really matter once you get into it), of which most of them are in mini skirts <br />
&quot;like really mini, and for some reason always has some sort of pants angle&quot;<br />
<br />
again, don&#039;t really mind<br />
<br />
so... story line. its just a show where female action figures are geared with artificial intelligence and they&#039;re pitted against each other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251818">
        in a holographic world.<br />
so they battle each other to gain data for themselves and the factory that is going to produce them  -they sent prototypes to be tested<br />
<br />
its not the sort of thing where it is good vs. bad, just something you&#039;d watch for fun.<br />
and this is funny, but not in the way you&#039;d expect... it&#039;s &#039;dumb funny&#039;<br />
<br />
most of the characters were a CGI style; this was so that they could be separated from the humans present and all the toys went through a process of evolution in emotion and behaviour<br />
oooh yes, the characters were all initially diverse to begin with; this anime gave the masochists, the sadist, the dumb, the tsundere, the childish, and the egoists... moreover they gave the god archetype and the clever but socially dumb type.<br />
the character build ups are so good that you dont even realise there arwe no prominent male figures<br />
there was a protagonist and deuteragonist... but the lack of an solid antagonist kind of broke down the prior two&#039;s purpose  <br />
<br />
If it was CGI, it wasn&#039;t slow and the movements were quite fluid at the crucial times<br />
<br />
____________________SPOILER_ALERT_____________________<br />
the end was weird, like really weird; somehow the show turned into some idol concert and they&#039;re dancing aroung with those hunks of armour on.<br />
______________________________________________________<br />
<br />
all in all, this is the sort of thing you&#039;d watch when you&#039;re not looking for anything specific so you just want to laugh e.g. sitcoms etc. (like the big bang theory)

    Watch it if you<br />
- like overpriced plastic toys and commercials about them<br />
- think that half-done animations are the future<br />
- already had your skull acquainted with a power drill<br />
- have an undying infatuation with panty-shots<br />
- REALLY like overpriced plastic toys and commercials about them<br />
<br />
DO NOT watch it if you<br />
- think that an audience deserves more than a full season of commercials<br />
- wish to see unique characters interact with each other<br />
- you expect an actual story beyond &quot;stuff happens, occasionally incomplete fight sequences)<br />
- believe that humour has greater depths than a pond for newborn ducklings<br />
- find pointless lewd camera angles more offensive than arousing<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s make it clear

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250381">
        what this is: a series of commercials for a bunch of action figures aimed at people who enjoy staring at plastic underwear and can take seriously a product that is usually abbreviated as &quot;FAGirls&quot;.<br />
And as it is nothing but a commercial (including a literal factory visit episode that makes me want to watch &#039;90s toy ads as a more subtle form of advertisement), it carries the amount of creative work one would exoect from such.<br />
A rushed production, lacking a strong narrative, decent humour, visual aesthetics, the whole thing carries a definite &quot;thrown together in the last moment&quot; vibe, the only two aspects that seem to matter are the visibility of the advertised products and the blantant fanservice.<br />
All and all, the best I could say about this series is that it&#039;s better than jamming rusted needles in my eyes, but only by a slight margin.<br />
Take the advice from your racist neighbor and &quot;avoid them F.A.G.s&quot;, it&#039;s for your own good!

    Frame Arms Girl for those who don&#039;t know is the model kit line produced by Kotobukiya and this line is essentially having mecha musume characters with armour and weapons for them to &quot;fight&quot;...so yeah this anime is a living advertisement for Frame Arms Girl.....with for at least expected results.<br />
<br />
Frame Arms Girl follows Ao Gennai voiced by Yoko Hikasa who gets a delivery and obtains Gourai voiced by Narumi Kaho and thus Ao dives into the world of Frame Arms Girl as she now is &quot;willing&quot; to give data to Factory Advance for data.<br />
<br />
Frame Arms Girl is a straight up slice of life anime involving the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284779">
        Frame Arms Girl with fighting in-between to this setup with the plot structure following suit until the last 2 episodes or so. <br />
<br />
Because of this, the character department is rather slim nonetheless. Ao Gennai is our audience surrogate and has a pension for getting money which Factory Advance is willing to give her unless she gets data, this becomes a running gag to say the least. LA really likes Ao, not only because she&#039;s an audience surrogate which helps as she&#039;s is in the same level as the audience but her bubbly personality and not the typical &quot;genius&quot; the anime is focused in helps us relate to Ao even further. Ao Gennai is easily LA&#039;s favorite character in the entire series. Gourai is our main heroine along with Ao and she.....for LA is rather bland of a character, being the archetype of &quot;robot wanting to know what emotions are&quot;, which YES, she is tasked to do, but her personality is down by the numbers cept her undying loyalty to Ao which is probably her only identity about herself. Stylet voiced by Yuu Ayase is...the butt monkey of the cast but also a tsundere towards Gourai, along with Stylet is Baselard voiced by Rika Nagae is the trickster/genkiest character in the cast and because of this LA&#039;s favourite Frame Arms Girl would go to both Stylet and Baselard. Jinrai voiced by Minami Kabayama is the Edo-centric otaku character and is the resilient type. The Materia Sisters voiced both by Erii Yamazaki were LA&#039;s least favoruite characters in the cast however, what with their S&amp;M schtick to almost the entire cast, there wasn&#039;t much to them besides that..well that and unnecessary fanservice by them. Architect voiced by Hibiku Yamamura is the typical kuudere without any of the dere and she is the typical exposition fairy because of it. Finally we have Hres- Hrus- Husqvarna *ahem* Hresvelgr voiced by Rika Abe being the only &quot;villain&quot; of the series though LA says the &quot;villain&quot; VERY loosely as she&#039;s more like Gourai&#039;s &quot;true rival&quot; and her arrival pretty much causes the anime&#039;s direction to unnecessary serious. The only other character in terms of support is Bukiko KOTOBUKI (LA see what you did there) voiced by Kanomi Izawa as the resident otaku for the Frame Arms Girl and helps Ao for new parts.<br />
<br />
LA really didn&#039;t mind Frame Arms Girl&#039;s direction of using slice of life to at least give us a decent laugh or so or make the Frame Arms Girl or Ao get into crazy hijinks as oddly enough LA expected this to happen quite early on, what was a weird tonal dissonance is as LA aforementioned is when Hresvelgr enters the scene and things get serious, look LA isn&#039;t saying that Frame Arms Girl CAN&#039;T be serious or anything, it can be especially with the typical themes of friendship that Hresvelgr is opposed to compared to Ao and Gourai are for, but when the majority and bulk of the anime is nothing but Frame Arms Girl battling for fun or Frame Arms Girl goes into hijinks THEN gets serious of having Hresvelgr goes nuts LA just couldn&#039;t believe it to say it lightly as much as it&#039;s typical of &quot;having the final serious battle for the ending&quot; cliche. Hresvelgr is a good comparison and &quot;rival&quot; to Gourai, heck she even developed the bland Gourai for LA and that helped, what really gave LA that tonal dissonance is the final battle given and even with the stakes high LA couldn&#039;t take the final battle seriously as serious as it had gotten.<br />
<br />
On speaking of the final battle, the ending wasn&#039;t that bad besides the tonally off final battle itself, it send itself off as LA expected to say the least, yes even the idol-esque singing was appropriate for the ending with a stinger for a second season that HAS been announced as LA wrote this review, though LA really wouldn&#039;t know how a second season is possible with the ending it gave itself.<br />
<br />
The animation done by  Zexcs and Studio A-CAT was decent to say the least and LA is saying this including the 3D CGI and even that made consistent sense to use it when it did. Well LA means by this is that the 3D incorporates the anime ALOT but it isn&#039;t abused like you&#039;d think. The 3D is obviously used for the Frame Arms Girl both outside of fighting and off fighting as well yeah they ARE mecha figures why can&#039;t the 3D be used and LA means consistent as when the Frame Arms Girl get expressive they switch to 2D to really make the Frame Arms Girl to allow them to emote properly and they do it consistently, so Studio A-CAT in charge of the 3D had the sense of using their 3D well. Zexcs was decent overall with the character designs (mainly Ao&#039;s many costume changes) and background though the only thing LA will say about the animation besides it was decent overall and made use o fit&#039;s 3D is that the anime itself had unnecessary fanservice which is mostly awkward panty shots (yes even in battle they show it off), YUP it&#039;s Zexcs alright!...though the yuri undertones can stay (besides the Materia Sisters antics)<br />
<br />
The voice acting is typical to say the least and not much to say really as most of the character archetypes LA said were as expected. The only thing to note is Yoko Hikasa as Ao as LA&#039;s favourite voice actor with maybe Yuu Ayase and Rika Nagae along with her.<br />
<br />
Frame Arms Girl is what you really expected from the words &quot;slice of life&quot; and &quot;advertisement&quot; and LA means that in a good way and for a person who really doesn&#039;t like the model kit figurine line and rather buy the figurine fully done with little to no assembly, Frame Arms Girl intentionally taught LA a bit of model kit making in the process, though that really REALLY isn&#039;t saying much but nonetheless. Frame Arms Girl is mediocre but of the relaxing &quot;ok&quot; caliber, with a relatable main heroine with decent character chemistry through most of the cast, lax slice of life/comedic skit stories with a tonally off direction change near the ending but nonetheless with decently used animation with a typical voice cast, Frame Arms Girl did &quot;ok&quot; as much as it&#039;s an advertisement for Kotobukiya&#039;s mecha musume line and really it was what LA expected from this kind of premise in every way, not horrible, not great but juuuust mediocre and not in a bad way either.

    This anime is not bad at all. In fact, despite rating it average, I can&#039;t say that it&#039;s waste of time. I actually looked forward to watching more, after each ep. It&#039;s very eccentric, in a surprisingly good way.<br />
<br />
On the downside, the the story&#039;s extremely simple and non-original, with 1 dimensional characters. On the bright side, they ran with those facts for wacky laughs, which boosted the enjoyment factor.<br />
<br />
I particularly liked the little details in the art, such the use of pop-up bubbles to show detail and also the use of it to show a highly animated talking head of Ao. I also loved the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265626">
        work they did with the audio, with liberal use of simple yet catchy BGM on most scenes, with the one hide-and-seek scene really impressing me with what Baselard did.<br />
<br />
Elaborating on the story and characters, they threw in all sorts of wacky ass-pulls, flashbacks, conflict drop-ins, and random skits. I suppose when the story is completely lacking, these can&#039;t cheapen it any more, but actually do the opposite, adding depth to the story. The characters went from truly 1 dimensional, wanting battle and having 1 particular strength, but eventually showed a few new sides to them, though simple, still added to enjoyment factor. It made each episode relatively fresh and unique. It was like a sandbox environment with imagination added.<br />
<br />
I went in with no expectations, braved watching past the first 2 episodes, and got hooked. I began wondering why, then started analyzing the direction, cinematic effects, audio, details in the art, how well the CG blended in, etc. I sensed talented producers having fun with the project, having a bit more creative freedom. It&#039;s a promo for a toy I&#039;d likely won&#039;t buy, with a young girl-friendly perspective to it, where they play house. It&#039;s not all about competition and be-the-best, like other stories around plastic models, but they do make it seem exciting to have rare things and make it seem okay to get really nerdy about it.<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;m a bit embarrassed to have found this enjoyable. I wouldn&#039;t recommend it, but I don&#039;t regret deciding to watch/experience it. Kind of like a guilty pleasure--don&#039;t need a story or characters to enjoy something (ex. porno or AMV), but having such does make it more &quot;wholesome&quot;. These guys were certainly successful, expanding my world to now know about these plastic models, how they&#039;re made, and how some imagine playing with them. Perhaps someone might try to develop such technology, like they did from other pop culture (ex. hoverboard, star wars vehicles, jetpack, etc.).
