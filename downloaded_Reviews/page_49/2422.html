    Being both a fan of Star Wars and anime, this collaboration seemed like a gift from the gods. How could I not be excited for this! Even with the score I have given it, it still lived up to my expectations. <br />
<br />
※ Story: 5/10 ※ <br />
<br />
As an episodic series. there was a great variation in the tone for each episode. In some episodes, we viewed a light-hearted and dreamy scene unfold, while in others, we witnessed a more serious tone with more mature scenes.<br />
<br />
Each episode did well in differentiating itself from the others in its storytelling. It didn&#039;t feel repetitive despite most episodes revolving around

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417759">
        &#039;The Force&#039; and Jedis. The direction that the episodes took was also unexpected and not cliche. I found myself surprised with some of the decisions the story writers made.<br />
<br />
That being said, there was nothing incredible about the stories, nothing intelligent or awe-inspiring, especially with the time constraints for each episode. Quite a few didn&#039;t close off the story but rather instigated the idea of a follow-up. <br />
<br />
In terms of being &#039;Star Wars&#039;, I&#039;m glad these aren&#039;t Canon. The series took a lot of creative liberty with Star Wars lore, with episodes breaching it on many occasions. That being said, there we iconic Star Wars vehicles, planets and figures that returned to remind you that this is in fact Star Wars. <br />
<br />
Of course, this would not be anime without some Japanese culture in it. The Star Wars technologies and Japanese culture were interwoven well whether through the settings, characters or tools. It was very cool to see such a combination come to life.<br />
<br />
※ Characters: 6/10 ※<br />
<br />
For characters, there were a few well-written ones such as Dan and Tajin who had great chemistry and F. Other than that, no character really stood out as special nor memorable, just average, with a simple motive and a simple personality. <br />
<br />
Character designs were done well, especially in the 1st and 7th episodes. I would have liked more Aliens in the main casts, but I&#039;m still contempt with what we got as no main character was appalling, except the furry one. <br />
<br />
※ Production: 7.5/10 ※<br />
<br />
The animation and sound are definitely where the anime shines. The iconic lightsaber sound coupled with great animation made for interesting fights. The Choreography in this was, I would argue, better than in some Canon Star Wars media, I was impressed with it. <br />
<br />
Wide shots in some of the episodes incorporated heavy CG for the scale which was a bit offputting, but completely understandable.<br />
<br />
The music definitely had that Star Wars vibe meshed in with some traditional Japanese music, contributing well to their respective scenes.<br />
<br />
※ Enjoyment: 5/10 ※<br />
<br />
The score for this category is a bit misleading as some of the episodes were superb (my personal favourites were episodes 1, 4 and 7) while others paled in comparison, primarily because of the boring setting and plot. <br />
<br />
Lightsaber fights just never get old and the anime maintained that while adding its own originality.<br />
<br />
For anyone who is a Star Wars and anime fan, I highly recommend Star Wars: Visions!

    Disney has been taking over the movie industry step by step, so naturally it wasn&#039;t long before they show an interest in anime. What resulted is their first original anime based off a popular franchise that they purchased the rights to about a decade ago, Star Wars: Visions. Deciding to make an anthology about Star Wars was an interesting idea, and they decided to hire seven different anime studios to animate nine short self contained episodes. This resulted in nine episodes of varying quality, but the decision to compile short stories itself had its own strength and flaws.<br />
<br />
Let me get this out of the way.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417767">
        I am not a huge Star Wars fan in general, and outside of the three main trilogies, Rogue One, and The Mandalorian, I don&#039;t know anything else about the universe. So perhaps there are a bunch of references to other shows or books, but I wouldn&#039;t know. That being said, I found the episodes with obvious easter eggs to be of lesser quality than the other episodes. Additionally, I can say that one doesn&#039;t need to be really familiar to enjoy this anthology.<br />
<br />
The pros of short self contained episodes is that it gives more imagination to the creative team and that if one person doesn&#039;t like an episode, they can watch the next and perhaps enjoy it. The cons of this style is that people that prefer a narrative and recurring characters might not get invested and that having a one-shot even that one enjoys can become unsatisfying if their isn&#039;t more. <br />
<br />
Likewise, some episodes in this anthology focus more on story while others focus on style. Depending on what type of person one is will impact which shorts one ends up liking. So I will briefly get into the individual episodes. <br />
<br />
The first episode, The Duel, is animated by Studio Kamikaze Douga and is a nice enough introduction. It is very style heavy and utilizes experimental animation. It isn&#039;t deep, but the animation and coolness of the characters influence how much one likes it. <br />
<br />
The second episode, Tatooine Rhapsody, by Studio Colorido, has the most amount of references to the main series, but it ended up being the most disappointing. This is doubly true once finishing the anthology and realizing how different it is, and not in a good way. It&#039;s aimed much more toward a younger audience with its cutesy and dull animation and doesn&#039;t have any stakes worth caring about. It&#039;s more of a musical, and leaves more inconsistencies and questions than one would like.<br />
<br />
The third episode, The Twins, by Studio Trigger, is what most people expected it to be: an insane sakuga fest of zany action. The story&#039;s focus is very narrow and it just sets up the two twins to fight. Interestingly, it serves as an clever contrast to the original Star Wars trilogy. Sort of like a &quot;what-if&quot; scenario. It is easy to poke holes at some things that happen, but it&#039;s Trigger, so that isn&#039;t the point. Like why does an android need an astronaut helmet in space? The underlying story and action make the episode a fun adventure in the anthology.<br />
<br />
The fourth episode, The Village Bride, by Studio Kinema Citrus, has the best soundtrack of the series, composed by Kevin Penkin and has one of the coolest characters in the anthology, simply referred to as &quot;F&quot;. The story isn&#039;t that compelling, but the atmosphere set up by the animation and soundtrack make a good showing with a bombastic finale with great action. <br />
<br />
The fifth episode, The Ninth Jedi, by Studio Production I.G., is possibly the overall best piece in this show. It contains a full story, sets up a potential sequel, and has elements of action, mystery, and suspense. Constructed around a interesting cast of characters, especially the lead, it all culminates in a finely told story which will definitely surprise the viewer. This is the episode feels ike it could have deserved a full series.<br />
<br />
The sixth episode, T0-B1, by Studio Science Saru, is cute and fun, but it doesn&#039;t do much besides that. The animation throughout the episode is pretty good, especially in the action scene, but it&#039;s mostly style and little substance. <br />
<br />
The seventh episode, The Elder, once again animated by Studio Trigger, is very different than their previous short. It&#039;s more substance than it is style. It is a slow burn, or at least relatively compared to the runtime. It&#039;s mainly the two main characters bantering in conversation. Towards the end though, a new character makes an appearance and some chaos ensues. It could have benefited with more of a story, but the calm story and characters makes an interesting contrast to their previous episode.<br />
<br />
The eighth episode, Lop and Ochō, by Studio Geno Studio, is was one of the more highly anticipated episodes of this anthology, along with the Trigger episode, and this episode is an easy contender with the fifth episode as the best of the show. The animation style, the characters, and the story are brought together in a truly engaging tale of two adopted sisters finding themselves at odds with each other. It could have benefitted with a longer runtime, but that&#039;s true with all of the shorts.<br />
<br />
The ninth episode, Akakiri, once again by Studio Science Saru, is another instance of extreme contrast between same studio episodes. While the first they did was colorful and cheerful, this is a lot darker in both color and tone. It also plays to their strength of trippy animation. That being said, it&#039;s mostly substance and if it wasn&#039;t for the unpredictably dark cliffhanger at the end, it would end up as a complete turn off of a final episode due to being a very weak stand alone. As it turned out, the dark ending might be why they left it for last.<br />
<br />
So that&#039;s all the episodes. They all could have benefitted from a longer runtime, but they are shorts for a reason. In general, the longer ones were better than the shorter ones, which makes sense. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not easy to score an anthology, as there are strong entries and weak entries, but overall, I would say that whether one is a fan of Star Wars or not, there is enough content of different variety that most people will find at least one episode that appeals to them. Again, the episodes that one ends up liking will depend greatly on personal tastes and whether one prefers substance or style. <br />
<br />
I am scoring this anthology an 8. I enjoyed it enough to keep me watching without stopping and there are storylines that I am highly anticipating seeing sequels to if they ever come.

    I’ve been so apathetic towards Star Wars for a couple of years now. I didn’t hate the new Disney movies, however the constant yearly releases, and the constant arguing from fans, by the time episode 9 came out I was just done with Star Wars. I didn’t really wanna have anything to do with it anymore.<br />
<br />
However, with the announcement of this anthology series, I felt happy about Star Wars again. The trailer really grabbed me. I was still skeptical, of course, but I was more happy about this than other Star Wars media because this was going to be something unique for the series.<br />
<br />
And I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417765">
        was right to be happy about this, because this set of mini Star Wars stories were, for the most part, really great. It just feels fun to be happy about Star Wars again.<br />
<br />
My ranking of the episodes from best to worst goes like this: 8,6,4,1,3,7,2,5 and 9. The only one I really disliked was episode 9, however, even that one had some moments. It’s difficult to rate overall, since it’s an anthology and all. But I feel like a 9/10 is good for it. It’s just so great to see all these different takes on Star Wars. And it’s no secret that Star Wars is somewhat inspired by Akira Kurosawa’s samurai movies, so this feels like it’s come full circle in some ways.<br />
<br />
It’s difficult to talk about this without spoiling by things but yeah. I really enjoyed it, Lop is the best Star Wars character, and I really hope we get more of this anthology series. Maybe even some continuations of the episodes here. Especially for episode 1, 2, 5 and 8. Those I would love to see more of.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
Overall, the stories were all pretty damn solid. The only major problem being that there’s not enough of it! I need more of these stories! The highlight for me in the story department is episode 8!<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
It’s the main reason I decided to watch it, and it doesn’t disappoint, it’s worth watching for the animation alone. The highlight for the art is either episode 3 or episode 6 or 8… or 4. It’s a tough decision.<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
I’m not great with deciding if music is good or bad, but I enjoyed it in this, the soundtrack for episode 4 is the highlight of this.<br />
Characters: 7/10<br />
While characters have only a 7/10, which is the lowest of the scores I’ve given here, they are still great. There are just a lot of two dimensional characters that I didn’t really like, but also a lot of great characters, so it evens out. Lop from episode 8 is my favourite, but the Jedi F from episode 4, Kara from episode 5 and Ronin from the first episode are also pretty amazing characters.<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
I was not bored for a second. I had fun even with the few flaws I had with it, especially episode 9, but still. I’m definitely rewatching this soon, and this time with the original Japanese language version.<br />
Overall 9/10<br />
Go watch it. This is super important. If it gets popular enough, Disney might let these studios or even more studios have a go at playing with the Star Wars IP. It’s a wonderful anthology!

       If you have never watched Star Wars, you can watch the anime without any problems, if you know what a Jedi is, that&#039;s fine. Another attempt by Disney to do something different with Star Wars, being Japanese we can see samurai jedi and homages to classic manga works like &quot;Vagabond&quot; and &quot;Astro Boy&quot; with good art, but it&#039;s a shame that it&#039;s a bad anime....<br />

-Story: 4/10 (Lack of plot)<br />
Star Wars visions has reasonably good ideas for its episodes but its big problem would be their short screen time, it is hard to build a good story in only fourteen minutes,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418828">
        as we can see, in many episodes the flaw is evident, where the anime shows us dramas and fights, without even presenting the characters or a good context. Such factors that make climactic scenes futile and ignorable, unless you&#039;re the type to be entertained by anything.<br />
<br />
-Art: 8/10 (Beautiful and creative)<br />
The production is the best part of the show, each studio did their best and did their best to make their animations, especially episodes one and three, where it is beautiful in artistic terms and very well directed. impressive.<br />
<br />
-Sound: 6/10 (ok...)<br />
The soundtracks vary with the episodes, but there is nothing so remarkable, the sound effects are good, but that&#039;s about it<br />
<br />
-Characters: 4/10 (disposable...)<br />
Of all the episodes we have at most 3 good characters, little screen time hinders you from generating some empathy for the characters, in its great majority they are nothing but posts without charisma or even without motivations or personality. In a certain episode the anime even tries to make a drama with the death of a character that you didn&#039;t even realize was there so useless, it was funny.<br />
<br />
-Enjoyment: 4.5/10 (You can stay awake)<br />
Honestly, none of the nine episodes I consider good, what saves the anime from boring you is that it&#039;s short. Star Wars Visions is nothing but a show of animation and random fights on your screen.

    First off, let me state that I&#039;m a huge fan of star wars. When it comes to reviewing the product, I try to be as neutral as possible, but undoubtedly, theres going to be bias there, as there is with anything. With that, lets see how this newest instalment to the cultural phenomenon stacks up.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s good. Like pretty good actually. Now in my head, I had imagined this to be 9 long form products (movies or series) that would each be marked on their own merit, but I must of missed something somewhere. I was a little upset when I realised it was 9 short

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417788">
        stories. But nevertheless, I hoped for the best.<br />
<br />
Each short story has its own thing its trying to do, and they all do it to varying degrees of proficiency. The first is mostly an art piece based around the CGI, the 3rd is exactly what you would expect from trigger (hype, themes and good animation) etc etc. All except for the 9th one. The 9th one is weird. It has ideas on destiny and choice, but then seems to give a nihilistic ending. Now as far as i&#039;m aware there is no second season planned. So this 9th episode is just very weird and I don&#039;t really understand the point of it.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s hard to talk about any aspect on a consistent level as it varies from episode to episode. But for me: episode 1 was the best visually and atmospherically, episode 4 was the best on a music level, episode 7 was the best &quot;star wars&quot; episode and Episode 3 was the best overall. I really liked the aesthetic of episode 6 (sort of an Astro Boy feel), but the pacing was really fast on that one, which ruined my enjoyment a bit. Episode 8 was also really solid all around, and with a bit better execution could of been the best overall. A few episodes peak up to 10&#039;s in some aspects, and very few drop below a 5 or 6 on any. Most end in this sort of 7-8 range.<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;m pretty happy. I even would of liked to see some of these in more of a long form. I would happily sit down and watch a 13 episode series for episode 1 and 7, a movie for 3 and 8 etc. So yh, if you like star wars, give it a watch.

    No connection between episodes, the story was half-baked and utilised on the most common anime tropes. Trying to set emotional backstories for characters we know for 10 minutes is a joke. No way I get attached to a character that quickly. It felt rushed and didn&#039;t capture that Star Wars feeling for me. Trying to do that every single episode was a such a mistake I do not know how it was even approved.<br />
 Soundtrack was fairly bland and didn&#039;t scream Star Wars to me. Animation was fine but nothing special. It felt super rushed.<br />
Waiting for each episode to end was dreadful. Good job Disney,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419237">
        you shat all over Star Wars. Hope you&#039;re proud.

    I grew up a Star Wars fan, and I haven&#039;t ever deviated from that. I love Star Wars, and I also love anime. I cannot explain how excited I was for this show to come out, but I am extremely disappointed. I heard Star Wars anime and that peaked my interest. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not complaining about it being episodic either that wasn&#039;t my issue, I liked that each episode felt different from the last. Art and animation was different in every episode. This is honestly just a horrible concept. Disney advertised that a bunch of studios in Japan would be making their own ONA&#039;s on Star

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417894">
        Wars and it&#039;s clear that some of the studios knew nothing about Star Wars. <br />
<br />
Episode 1: I&#039;m not a fan of 3D anime, but I really liked this episode. It was animated really well and didn&#039;t try to rush a story in 9 min like some of the other episodes. It just got straight to the point and I was satisfied and hooked on the rest of the show instantly. 8/10<br />
<br />
Episode 2: Easily my least favorite in the series. Had absolutely nothing to do with Star Wars, so the studio threw in Boba Fett and Jabba the Hutt just to get the title right. Not much else to say. 1/10<br />
<br />
Episode 3: Ok actually what the fuck was this episode. I don&#039;t think Studio Trigger did their research on Star Wars at all. Fighting in space with no space suits, a suit powered by kyber crystals, an astronomically long lightsaber. This was the dumbest shit I&#039;ve ever seen. 2/10<br />
<br />
Episode 4: I liked this episode the first time I watched it, but it&#039;s just extremely forgettable. I couldn&#039;t tell you what happened in this episode and I actually had to go back to Disney+ to see what this episode was. 4/10<br />
<br />
Episode 5: I didn&#039;t hate this episode either it was just super rushed. They tried to fit an entire story line into one episode and it didn&#039;t work. I feel like this episode could&#039;ve been better with more backstory or a longer runtime. 3/10<br />
<br />
Episode 6: I really liked the art style of this episode and animation of this episode. I also really liked the sound design of it. That&#039;s all I liked though. It was the most rushed episode in the series and it made the least amount of sense. (spoiler) A droid being a Jedi, being able to use the force, it just made no sense. 2/10<br />
<br />
Episode 7: I felt like this was gonna be a really good episode. The writing at the beginning was very strong, and they did a very good job of building up the villain. But they spent too much time doing that so the pay off wasn&#039;t satisfying. (spoiler) The villain was built up to be this super strong ex-Sith, but he was beaten very quickly with little resistance at all. 4/10<br />
<br />
Episode 8: I absolutely loved this episode. 0 complaints. They fit a very well developed story with great characters into a 20 min runtime without making it feel rushed. Every decision made by the characters was understandable and made sense whether you agree with them or not. All of their motivations were valid. 10/10<br />
<br />
Episode 9: Bad, rushed, and forgettable story. I&#039;ve never heard of Science SARU before, but I really liked both of their episodes&#039; art style and animation. The story of this episode was just awful though. The characters just seemed fake and unrealistic to me. 2/10

    There were only two episodes that were worth watching. The other episodes had terrible art and story overall. The second episde felt so bad after watching the first one, which was one of the good episodes, that I spent the whole time wondering what I was watching and if it wasn&#039;t some kind of a joke. <br />
As for sound, it was very nice and enjoyable. The art of some of the episodes was good while of others just bad. The story had no connection at all, each episode had a different charecters and situations, and most of them were just like a cartoon for 3

    Star Wars Visions is a set of different stories told by different people and is developed by different staff. I will review each episode on its own, but assign a rating for the entire set at the end.<br />
<br />
Some episodes are not even worth watching at all, while others tower above the franchise at a height not seen since the days of  Knights of the Old Republic games in 2003 or perhaps Timothy Zahn&#039;s Heir to the Empire (The Thrawn Trilogy) published all the way back in 1991.<br />
<br />
At the very top of this pinnacle stands episode 5. The storytelling and directing is on point. From

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417935">
        only a few minutes in, I could tell from the color palette, faces, and camera shots that this was from Production IG and specifically director and writer that worked on Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Kenji Kamiyama. Every moment oozes character, an understanding of the established Star Wars Universe&#039;s lore, and introduces new ideas that are compatible with it. The story rides the line of unexpectedness and inevitability that all writers strive for and draws on a deep well of experience and creativity. This episode has the highest fidelity and also holds the most promising story out of all the series.<br />
<br />
Closely behind are episodes 1, 4, and 8. They are excellent additions that fall only slightly behind when considering story, but have individual qualities which surpass the 5th episode. The 1st has the most intense battles that draw out the tension for most of the episode and is heavily inspired by old samurai films, the 4th has the greatest soundtrack and captures a feeling of magic that none of the other episodes hold a candle to, and the 8th has the highest production value and best animation of the set. These are also worthwhile contributions to the Star Wars Universe and are far above average for what the Old SWU and New SWU had to offer over the last 35 years.<br />
<br />
Episode 7 is decent, but does not add enough of its own flavor to be considered in league with the aforementioned 4 episodes. <br />
<br />
Episode 9 has a story that I could not care about. <br />
<br />
Episode 2 is a musical episode, targeted towards a younger audience and something I am not suited for. From an adults perspective it has very little charm. <br />
<br />
Likewise, Episode 6 falls into this same category, only it is more frantic and disorganized.<br />
<br />
Episode 3 fails to deliver. Trigger has lost their soul and while their storytelling is clearly identifiable, it is now unchanging and uninspired. They grasp no essence of what Star Wars or its universe is. I daresay they didn&#039;t even bother. It reminds me of The Last Jedi, and not in a good way. This is the worst episode the series has to offer, while representing the heart of the mediocrity that plagues so many mainstream anime.<br />
<br />
The short of it? Watch 1, 4, 5, and 8. Skip the rest unless you are a die hard Star Wars fan. On the whole, this series is a 6/10 for me, but I would probably rate the stand-out individual episodes a 9/10.<br />
<br />
Postscript/Disclaimer:<br />
This is from someone who has fallen in and out of Star Wars fandom over the years and has read over a hundred Star Wars novels from the pre-Disney era. I also have the luxury to enjoy these in the original language. The Disney subtitles for the Japanese audio are insultingly awful. At times they directly contradict what is actually being said or are outright wrong. These are things as severe as reading 山（やま）mountain as 空（そら）sky, something not even an amateur would make. We are not talking about non-literal interpretation, but rather violation of intent. <br />
<br />
Perhaps, in the future it would be good to look for fan-subs for these episodes.

    Star Wars Visions has some really great moments with fantastic art but that is all that can be said about it. The story changes each episode and with each episode only being 15 minutes the writing is pretty shallow and lacks an attempt at depth. The stories are extremely cliche and generic. The reason for the decently high rating on MAL mostly comes from Star Wars fans and the hype surrounding it.I do not fault the studios animating this at all the art for a majority of the episodes I have seen is done very well however art can only take something so far. Disney

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418148">
        should have made it a series with one story and each episode in a different art style so we could get something coherent instead of varying stories with little to no depth.

    Darth Vader: Luke, I&#039;m your father...<br />
<br />
Luke Skywalker: My father????NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Ok enough of that Empire Strikes Back monologue.  <br />
<br />
So:<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Pros: It was kinda nice that Disney has allowed studios  Production I.G, Kinema Citrus, Kamikaze Douga, Trigger, Studio Colorido, Geno Studio and Science SARU,to create each of their version of the iconic Star wars franchise....<br />
<br />
Coms: The problem since each of the studios were given their own version of the Star Wars episode, half of it were downright lame but half of it were masterpieces...TBFH, it wouldn&#039;t be fair to rate this as a whole since this ONA is a package deal so my ratings for this ONA:<br />
<br />
Verdict:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417904">
        6 over 10.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Pros: TBFH, there were a lot about the character illustartions that were good, but..<br />
<br />
Cons: There were also illustrations that were downright corny...so<br />
<br />
Verdict: 6 over 10  <br />
<br />
Sounds:<br />
<br />
Pros: Nothing to say.<br />
<br />
Cons: They didn&#039;t play the iconic sound track of the Star wars franchise, which the quintessential in all Star Wars franchise.<br />
<br />
Verdict: 4 Over 10<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
Pros: Well given that this ONA is a package deal, one cannot rate the characters as a whole in this ONA cu&#039;z of the fact that each episode has different main characters. The only thing constant around here is the antagonist be it the Imperial troop or Frist Order Troops.<br />
<br />
Cons: Nothing to say.<br />
<br />
Verdict: 4 Over 10.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Pros: This is the part where I like half of this ONA&#039;s episode.<br />
<br />
Cons: This is also the part that I hated half of this ONA&#039;s epsiode<br />
<br />
Verdict: 6 Over 10.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Verdict: 6 Over 10.<br />
<br />
It was a bit of a sign to be able to watch a Star Wars Japanize version, but given that the ONA itself is a package deal, it&#039;s either you accept this as a whole or just dump is in its entirety. So, that all folks.<br />
<br />
May the force be with you...   <br />

    First Review that I have made<br />
<br />
This show was just alright. Episodes 1 and 5 were great, and episodes  and 9 were really good, but the others spanned from alright, to mediocre, to somewhat disappointing. I value story more than animation (which was really good in all the episodes). Other than the four episodes stated above, the story was either confusing, weirdly paced, or couldn&#039;t get me invested in the characters. I have noticed that many people blame this on the fact that they are all shorts, but a similar show (that being Halo Legends) was able to pull this sort of thing off really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417885">
        well even though the show was formatted the exact same way as Visons. Nothing in Visons came close to the storytelling of Halo Legends The Duel or Prototype. I think another thing that hampered my enjoyment of the show was the trailer. The trailer got me really hyped, but it seemed that almost all of the best scenes in this show were shown in that trailer. When you&#039;ve already scene the best the show has to offer in the trailer, it makes it feel kind of pointless to watch the rest of the show since you&#039;ve scene the best of it. Definitely won&#039;t rewatch the entire show nor recommend to people who don&#039;t like anime or star wars that much.<br />
<br />
All in all the show had some very good episodes in it, but the others drag it down. I think a 6= fair is the best score this show should get. Then again, I can&#039;t nor won&#039;t judge those that absolutely loved the show.

    Star Wars visions, although not perfect, is a beautiful love letter to the Star Wars franchise as a whole. It complements the themes and dances around it magnificently, being able to take pride in being in the Star Wars universe. Each episode of visions has its own unique direction and storytelling method that stands out on its own, from a samurai story to a journey of a band and even a stunningly breathtaking tale about a devastating torn of a family (which is probably my favorite episode). A lot of the characters were able to engage with the audience, getting to know their personality/goal by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417838">
        a “blink and you’ll miss it” show not tell method, or through dialogs between characters, or simply just by letting the action scenes speak for itself. Speaking of the action scenes, the fights were greatly animated, and a lot of times, it was also capable of adding to the story beat.<br />
<br />
However, I do think that it isn’t flawless. Some people may point out the pacing issues it had, but for me, that makes sense since it was mostly around 12+ minutes an episode. There are also some people who might notice the over repetition of some plot points, but the way each episode was able to tell its story their own way with their own unique style, characters, animation, and message, ultimately shine the most out of the series, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Overall, I would say this series was worth the watch and I would give it around a high 8 / low 9

    As a massive star wars fan, I had extremely high hopes for this show, and it did not disappoint for the most part. Star Wars Visions is an anthology series, meaning that each episode tells its own story, and because of that It&#039;s really hard to rate this show as a whole, so Instead, I&#039;m going to rate each episode on its own.<br />
<br />
The Duel<br />
<br />
This episode was great because of how different it was compared to the rest, the colors are in black and white apart from the lightsabers and blasters. It felt like an old Japanese samurai film which isn&#039;t surprising considering that George Lucas

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417778">
        was inspired by many old Japanese films. The animation was fantastic, the fight scenes were great, and the music was pretty good. Overall 8.8/10<br />
<br />
Tatooine Rhapsody<br />
<br />
This episode was terrible. 3/10. I don&#039;t want to say anything else.<br />
<br />
The Twins<br />
<br />
This was the episode I was most excited about because it was made by Studio Trigger but I was kinda disappointed by this episode. The animation was amazing as always, but the over-the-topness didn&#039;t really feel right in star wars. I&#039;m not saying it was bad, It was still fun to watch, It just feels like the Gurren Lagaan style and star wars, don&#039;t really mix well together. 7.3/10.<br />
<br />
The Village Bride<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really have anything to say about this episode. 8.3/10.<br />
<br />
The Ninth Jedi<br />
<br />
9/10. I feel too lazy to write anything anymore<br />
<br />
T0-B1<br />
<br />
What If...? Astro Boy became a Jedi 7.7/10.<br />
<br />
The Elder<br />
<br />
8.4/10.<br />
<br />
Lop and Ocho<br />
<br />
8.6/10. <br />
<br />
Akakiri<br />
<br />
8/10.<br />
<br />
Overall if you&#039;re a massive Star Wars fan, definitely give this a watch and If you&#039;re not a Star Wars fan, you might still enjoy this show as it doesn&#039;t really require you to watch the other films and shows 8.4/10.<br />
<br />

    Star Wars: Visions (2021)<br />
<br />
What a challenge laid down, one that makes me wonder what didn&#039;t make the cut since at least two of them were trash in my opinion. I mean the last one was so bland I just couldn&#039;t believe it and episode 6 was the same in that it was just plain boring. <br />
That said, the other 7 are absolute banging, and show the brilliance of what could be if it is renewed for more. For me, this is the Disney+ version of Netflix&#039;s Love Death + Robots. <br />
<br />
The art styles range from superb and brilliant to dull and boring. It had a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420664">
        really strong start that weakened to a disappointing finale. Katana lightsabers are incredibly awesome, especially episodes 1 and 8. In episode 7 you get an amazing steam effect coming off a lightsaber in the rain too. <br />
<br />
With sound, we don&#039;t really have an OP or ED but you do get a very varied soundtrack that is mostly pretty amazing. <br />
<br />
The characters they introduce are sometimes unexpected and deep with amazing stories in such a short time. Others are just a waste since I felt nothing in episode 6 or 9 since it was such a lame conclusion. <br />
<br />
I would say the only thing episode 9 had was an unusual story that was refreshing but at the same time, it was dull, just so dull. Instead of worldbuilding for three-quarters of the episode actually develop the story in the time given. You do get amazing moments through the series and one of my funniest thoughts is episode 3 where the people on the other Imperial Star Destroyer must just be stood there like damn that could have been us. <br />
<br />
Overall, the series is strong but weak. In 7 of the 9, they are 9/10 out of 10 but the 6th and 9th were just so bad sitting around 1 or 2 which brings the score down to settle at 8 for me since I don&#039;t want to take too much from those that were great. <br />
<br />
8/10. Let&#039;s have a season 2 with more story vetting.

    I don&#039;t care too much about Star Wars. I liked the movies enough when I was younger, some less than others. I&#039;ve never been interested in the extended universe, the lore, or anything else about it really. What I do like though, are shorts compilations. And animation, obviously. I was pleasantly surprised when recently viewing The Animatrix; I like the Matrix movies but didn&#039;t think I would care for alternate stories or spin-offs. But turns out The Animatrix was merely an excuse to put out compelling visuals and narratives, experimenting with CGs on a short format, and not that much about &quot;respecting&quot; the original premise.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418455">
        I&#039;ve been anticipating the release of Star Wars: Visions, expecting just that: imaginative variations on a theme. I&#039;ve been on various degrees of hype depending on what we knew of the studios and directors beforehand, but there were some surprises for sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
EPISODE 1 - The Duel - (Takanobu Mizuno / KAMIKAZE DOUGA)<br />
<br />
The first shot of the episode made me soft-facepalm (a concept I just invented) as the graphics went for a cheesy old-silent-movie type grain. Often a sign of ill-advised nostalgia. I didn&#039;t feel very comfortable with the animation as well, as it had a strange  &quot;drawing over CG&quot; vibe where you kinda instinctively expected the characters to move in a drawn-animated way (because of the graphics&#039; effects), but then the actual animation is clearly CG. Not really clunky per se, but not very fluid. I also disliked the extremely grey and serious tone, that felt as if it tried to emulate &quot;adultness&quot; real hard. But that is clearly a personal preference, and probably why I don&#039;t enjoy s e r i o u s ronin stories for their atmosphere alone...<br />
Anyway, as it went along I warmed for the episode a bit; I still don&#039;t like some of the esthetic choices, but there are actually a lot of cool visual and cinematic ideas. This was well directed, the action was nicely staged. This was made for an audience that clearly isn&#039;t me, BUT it was cool enough.<br />
<br />
EPISODE 2 - Tatooine Rhapsody - (Taku Kimura / COLORIDO)<br />
<br />
Here comes the first real disappointment - and the worst episode in my opinion. I usually enjoy the Studio Colorido shorts. They&#039;re colorful and refreshing, experimenting whilst keeping a fun side to them. It&#039;s a cool studio really, if you happened to dislike this episode please don&#039;t give up on them. This episode though... the music was not only boring to my ears, but I felt Kimura failed at giving it any cinematic intensity. This was filmed very blandly. I didn&#039;t care for the characters&#039; designs and personnality. Sadly this was a chore to get through.<br />
<br />
EPISODE 3 - The Twins - (Hiroyuki Imaishi / TRIGGER)<br />
<br />
Ah, episode 3... By far the one I was anticipating the most, and lowkey the only reason I watched the whole thing in the first place. Leading up to the release my mind went like &quot;I don&#039;t care about Star Wars, but if Imaishi&#039;s involved tho...&quot;. I&#039;m a big Trigger fan and an even bigger Imaishi fan. As someone who especially enjoys what Imaishi&#039;s capable of in short formats (Cutie Honey episode 1, SEX and VIOLENCE with MACHSPEED, Dead Leaves...), I was thrilled to see him come back to the shorties.<br />
So The Twins was... OK, I guess. I mean, the actual fight scene was nice, there were the Imaishisms I love, but toned down. Yes that&#039;s it, the whole episode felt like a watered-down version of Trigger&#039;s usual braggadocio. The exposition and build-up to the actual fraternal confrontation failed to interest me. The final slicing was great at least, the destroyed shp shot was beautiful. But I wanted more. Maybe Imaishi didn&#039;t want to alienate Disney with his rather extreme and often crude choices?<br />
Better than the first ones for sure, but when the credits rolled I was prepared to think of Star Wars: Visions as an overall underwhelming experience.<br />
<br />
EPISODE 4 - The Village Bride - (Hitoshi Haga / KINEMA CITRUS)<br />
<br />
So just when I was starting to lower my expectations, the 4th episode surprised me with great world-building, nice sceneries and overall cool esthetic choices. And, spoilers, turns out all episodes remaining were good (and some were great), phew! So much for my growing grumpiness. About The Village Bride: the first time we see the couple hiking though the forest is such a great moment, you can immediately feel that there is some sort of tradition behind the way he transports her, and this tradition is made sensible though the vibrant interactions of the couple. In a few minutes this planet feels alive, and the sweet slice-of-life side is neatly contrasted with the mysterious presence of the other two protagonists. I&#039;m usually not the greatest fan of such coloring and shaping where every element in the scenery feels filtered though an ethereal filter and the shapes end up feeling angular and vague, but Kinema Citrus did it justice in this episode. A good surprise!<br />
<br />
EPISODE 5 - The Ninth Jedi - (Kenji Kamiyama / PRODUCTION I.G)<br />
<br />
And as my faith renewed, Star Wars: Visions hits me with what might be the best short of the bunch (top 2 at least). Production I.G shines through and through with this beautifully animated, carefully directed and overall greatly structured story about some wandering Jedis being summoned to receive lightsabers in a time when they went extinct. To those praise I&#039;ll add that I actually enjoyed the dub. Sadly, most of Star Wars: Visions&#039; dub was painful to my ears. I don&#039;t doubt the dub actors&#039; skills or anything but I&#039;ve never been able to really enjoy dubbed anime and Visions didn&#039;t change my mind about it. But The Ninth Jedi went through with the honors- except for the main young Jedi guy. Aside from that, everything here is beautiful, the fights are great, the chase is great (those frozen lake sceneries, damn). This is one I would particularly like for it to be expanded upon, either on a TV show or in a full-lenght movie. Kudos to Kenji Kamiyama &amp; I.G.<br />
<br />
EPISODE 6 - T0-B1 - (Abel Góngora / SCIENCE SARU)<br />
<br />
After watching the very disappointing last Masaaki Yuasa movie (Riding Your Wave) at the theater the week before, I was going into the two Science Saru shorts with of bit of apprehension in my heart. Fool was I, because both are good. And T0-B1 is particularly charming with its first part full of childlike wonder, truly beautiful, shapeshifting, colorful animation (as excepted from Science Saru). This feels like a Star Wars/Astro Boy crossover, with a cute little story at its center. The second part of the short is a heroic battle against a Sith. If felt a bit forced after the first part, like artificial conflit, but it&#039;s so well directed and animated that it&#039;s forgivable. If I had one gripe against this short it would be that the pacing felt a bit too fast - understandably since Abel Góngora had a lot he wanted to show, but it breaks the immersion at times and some scenes don&#039;t feel as intense as they could. But that&#039;s really a nitpick on my part, this was a really great short. I would really like to see a future version with twice the runtime.<br />
<br />
EPISODE 7 - The Elder - (Masahiko Otsuka / TRIGGER)<br />
<br />
Hey, second Trigger short! I wasn&#039;t expecting much after The Twins, but this one was pretty good. Didn&#039;t feel at all like a Trigger project though. The first scene had me concerned since it only features the two main characters having a bland discussion in a bland cockpit, but as soon as they land on the planet then the goodness really starts. The environments are magnificent, the textures feel so vibrant... I also loved the way they handled the fight. It was not too showy (it is really Trigger?), a dry fight with few hits but all of them mattered. The narrative reminded me of the way Hidetaka Miyazaki (from the Souls series, Bloodborne, Sekiro...) evokes past greatness by using old decrepit remnants as ominous fragments of the past. As such, the old Sith is a great character. He is fearsome enough whilst being only a shadow of his former self. That leaves us to imagine what ancient Sith power might look and feel like. Great storytelling technique.<br />
<br />
EPISODE 8 - Lop and Ochō - (Yuki Igarashi / GENO)<br />
<br />
When I saw the Disney+ preview, I thought this would be trash. Probably because because of my bias against furry character designs (which doesn&#039;t mean anything since I liked Beastars, BNA and Odd Taxi, but old habits die hard). And what a fool was I (again!), as this ended up being my other favorite of the bunch. Stellar production overall, it feels like they poured a whole movie budget into those 19 minutes. Each shot transpires high effort and dedication. The character design is amazing as well (I thought it wasn&#039;t at first, but that&#039;s actually because the sister dub actor is super annoying, her design is actually gorgeous), the sceneries and environments are painfully beautiful and detailed. We don&#039;t learn much about the actual planet, apart from the conflict with the Empire, but so much is made vibrant and alive through those backgrounds. It truly made me want to see this becoming a full series or a full film. Top 1 or 2 of the whole bunch.<br />
<br />
EPISODE 9 - Akakiri - (Eunyoung Choi / SCIENCE SARU)<br />
<br />
And here comes the last one, and second short from Science Saru, directed by none other than Eunyoung Choi, co-founder of the studio along with Masaaki Yuasa. Unsurprinsingly, this one is a beauty. Amidst all those realistic-looking animes it feels very refreshing to have Science Saru remind us why animation needs fantasy and flexibility. Looking cartoonish is not a bad thing. Akariri looks quite cartoonish (though not as much as T0-B1) whilst also telling a pretty dark and moody story - despite the comedic duo. The contrast feels quite nice, the oniric scenes (what seems at first like PTSD hallucinations from the Jedi protagonist) are very well rendered - the Studio excels at that -, and the unexpected finish was a great idea. This one also calls for a sequel... <br />
I&#039;ll just finish with adding that the short scene where the cast ride through rain was so beautifully animated it left me actually jaw-dropped. Another good short.<br />
<br />
<br />
So yeah, finishing thoughts. This was surprising in more ways than one. Good and bad surprises, but in the end way more good than bad thankfully. That&#039;s why I love shorts, the effort put into this format is really different from conducting a whole TV show, or a full movie. It&#039;s often a way for a creator or a whole team to experiment, to go a bit wild, to try things without the pressure of having to develop the concept further. Star Wars: Visions surprised me for sure, but in truth what I deeply wanted was probably to be surprised. Even if it is kind of a mixed bag (let&#039;s say it&#039;s the opposite of front-loaded), I will remember the good parts with time and forget the bad. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: Too bad they didn&#039;t consult each other about which Star Wars references they were going to use. Hearing the &quot;I have a bad feeling about this&quot; meme on 7 of the 9 shorts was getting a bit tiring.

    To think I&#039;d see star wars content as an anime. I am very impressed that we had such a diverse group of people working on different star wars content. I was looking forward to this and I wasn&#039;t disappointed only by the fact that it was limited to time which may have affected some of the story&#039;s content. If I would have rated all 9 I&#039;d give the top 3 from best to good starting with episodes 5 7 and 1. <br />
<br />
Episode 5 because It fits so well with the story albeit with some minor alterations with how things work in the world and it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417917">
        would be an awesome series This was my favorite short of the series. I think this story is set up in such a way that it just kept me wanting more. Kara had a better backstory and introduction than Rey, and the music by Nobuko Toda and Kazuma Jinnouchi had glimpses of her theme throughout the episode. I think the speeder chase and lightsaber battles kept the story fast-paced and exciting, even though it was the longest of the series with a runtime of 22 minutes. And of course, I can’t forget how cool the moment, in the end, was when the temple flipped to reveal the hilt of a lightsaber.<br />
<br />
As for episodes 7 and 1 both really caught my eye with how they used and depict the lightsabers. Episode 1 was a great way to kick off the series. The animation style drew inspiration from old westerns but made it action-packed with the pops of color from the weapons. The music by Keiji Inai created a true cinematic experience despite it only being 14 minutes. <br />
<br />
Episode 7 had one of the best villains of the series. The Elder was ruthless, savage, and absolutely creepy. There is one point where his eyes look so sunken into his head, showing how dark this Elder has gone. Tajin and Dan reminded me a lot of Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan with their relationship, and it was fun to see those hand communicators from the prequels being used. I think PT fans will rank this short as one of their favorites.<br />
<br />
If there would be an honorable mention I&#039;d give it to episode 3 I liked how it explored the dark side twin&#039;s story and the dynamic of a family caught in a power struggle. The droids, R-DUO and B-20N  were clearly inspired by R2-D2 and C-3PO, but they worked so well within the story. I really enjoyed how they used actual R2 sound effects for R-DUO. I could definitely watch a whole movie or series of these characters and loved how the ending left you wondering what comes next.<br />
<br />
With that, I do think Every studio certainly deserves applause for how they played their cards into their own take in the Star Wars Universe. They really nailed it on the female leads in 22 minutes or less you get a decent character exposition. What I would hope to see if there&#039;s another season is a studio exploring more on the SITH side than the JEDI I love star wars and I hope it wouldn&#039;t just revolve around the good guys what they really missed out on was exploring more of the past Old Republic I am hoping they don&#039;t limit themselves to the skywalker era.<br />

    Even though the episodes aren&#039;t long, they&#039;re pretty good. Of course, there are a few that aren&#039;t good, but the rest are outstanding. There are characters that are good. The soundtracks amazing. Animation outstanding.<br />
<br />
1. The first one &#039;The Duel&#039; is like you&#039;re watching an old film. It heavily inspired by Toho popular movie &#039;The Seven Samurai&#039;s&#039; with only the lightsabers and blasters colored. A nameless character only called as Ronin along with his trusted droid wandering and killing any Sith they encounter. Makes you wonder what&#039;s the Ronin real name is?<br />
<br />
2. The next one &#039;Tatooine Rhapsody&#039; seems pretty weak for me. A music band is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417871">
        an interesting idea. But doesn&#039;t have any hype other than Boba Fett. It&#039;s not a bad episode.<br />
<br />
3. Now &#039;The Twins&#039; is insane! I love the animation, the characters, and the fight scene. Twins born for the Dark Side is genius. I&#039;m surprised those two didn&#039;t suffocate out in the vacuum of space. Also why would a droid need a helmet to breath?<br />
<br />
4. For &#039;The Village Bride&#039; there&#039;s not much for me to say.<br />
<br />
5. Now &#039;The Ninth Jedi&#039; has a interesting plot. Lightsabers are forbidden to be used. And forbid for any Jedi to weld them. Having a Lightsaber to become any color whoever weld the blade is a pretty good idea to tell whose a Jedi and whose a Sith. I even like the soundtrack.<br />
<br />
6. For &#039;T0-B1&#039; is basically a Astroboy anime. And kind of hard to say.<br />
<br />
7. &#039;The Elder&#039; is a pretty good one, like Dan and his Master. The Sith old man is hard to think about.<br />
<br />
8. Now we&#039;ve seen some alien species that resemble as animals on Earth. &#039;Lop and Ochō&#039; is where a rabbit-like species is first shown. An escape slave girl gets adopted by a Royal Family is heartwarming. You never get many characters in Star Wars who where slaves other than some characters we know, like Anakin Skywalker. This episode is one of my favorites so far.<br />
<br />
9. And now &#039;Akakiri&#039; no doubt a version of Anakin falling to the Dark Side with a version of Palpatine. Like the animation, and see a Jedi falling to the Dark Side of the Force.<br />
<br />
These are my thoughts after all. I still liked how some of these episodes played out.

    Very few pieces of media have the associated vibrancy and individuality as that of Japanese Animation. It’s a truly incredible medium, packed with some of the most heartfelt and groundbreaking narratives we’ve ever seen. And so, naturally when fusing such distinct Eastern media with that of a legendary franchise birthed in the West, the byproduct is truly a sight to see.<br />
<br />
To sum it up lightly, Star Wars visions is an anthology series comprised of 9 episodic shorts each directed by high budget studios. Some of which I’m sure a lot of you might recognise. Such as Kinema Citrus, behind Made In Abyss, Production I.G behind…

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417830">
        Basically everything and Trigger who hold the winning title for the most colourful and vibrant anime studio to date. And the cool thing is, you don’t need to understand Star Wars to watch this show.. Like.. At all.<br />
<br />
It’s completely beginner friendly and so it’s great for fans exclusively anime, exclusively star wars or even both!<br />
<br />
Now before I discuss any of the content, I want to just comment on something fairly minor but I feel like it should be said anyways. The director for the almost universally praised Cowboy Bebop was sadly not a part of the production on Star Wars Visions and I really see this as a missed opportunity. Bebop is very much inspired by certain elements of Star Wars, I mean it’s literally about space cowboys and bounty hunters but I feel like Watanabe would’ve been a fantastic addition to this roster with his blooming artistic endeavours but hopefully we’ll see him be put to work in a potential sequel season.<br />
<br />
For now, let’s briefly talk about some of the episodes, and things I liked and didn’t like from them.<br />
<br />
The first episode entitled the Duel is pretty solid. It takes heavy inspiration from traditional samurai media and it’s nothing but quality really. I enjoyed it’s CGI usage, and this was in good hands seeing that these same people worked on some of the CGI for Jojos so it was bound to be great.<br />
<br />
Episode 2 is surprisingly brilliant. It follows the journey of an escaped padawan who joins a rock band, and is hunted by Boba Fett of all people, for it to come to an electrifying end with a huge performance in front of Jabba the hutt. Like, this is the most anime thing I’ve ever seen and I’m all for it. <br />
<br />
Episode 3 is just...sigh…. An absolute masterpiece. I fail to understand how studio Trigger just hits the mark every time but it’s expected at this point. This episode has some of the most vibrant and beautiful sakuga I’ve ever seen and it’s the lovechild of some of their best works such as Promare. This is easily the strongest entry out of all of them.<br />
<br />
Now the remaining episodes vary in terms of quality. They’re all good, don’t get me wrong, but some of them feel kinda same-y. Episode 1, 4, 7 and 9 kinda have the same premise of a village in danger, and the need of a Jedi to sort things out. Albeit episode 9 had a pretty dark twist, I just feel like some of these are sort of forgettable, however they do possess some fantastic dialogue and fight scenes so it can definitely be excused. A pretty surprising entry was episode 5, 6 and 8, these three have very unique premises and are just a sight to see. In general, the whole batch is nothing but energetic and powerful. Each is infused with immense love and each episode brings something unique to the table so that it feels fresh, even if some of the premises are similar. All in all, Star Wars Visions definitely lives up to the hype and I really can’t wait to see more.<br />
<br />
If anything, I’m just kinda taken aback that this is even a thing. Seeing these two giant worlds collide is the brink of something fresh and unique. Whilst it’s still flawed in its own right, the blooming artistic endeavours by each of these studios really water down some of those rough edges and it collectively builds up something truly special. Star Wars visions can be enjoyed all, it’s not exclusive to any party - anyone can jump in even without prior knowledge to either mediums, and have an absolute blast. This is a great way to introduce new and old fans to connect and bridge the gap between these 2 cultures that have been distant for far too long and I hope other franchises employ this same idea.. If you are planning to watch Star Wars Visions, I wish you the best of experiences… And one last thing… May the force be you, always..<br />
