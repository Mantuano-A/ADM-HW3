    Here&#039;s a multiple choice question before I begin talking about this series:<br />
<br />
What would you do when your carefree life is suddenly being thrown into unsettled chaos when three girls, a middle-schooler, a fifth-grader, and a toddler wants to be under you care due to an unprecedented tragedy?<br />
<br />
A) Call the cops<br />
B) Try to find another babysitter<br />
C) Slap yourself twice and tell yourself that this is all a dream and you&#039;ll wake up soon.<br />
D) Take responsibility, learn about the value of family life, and take care of them<br />
<br />
If you choose D, then kiss your carefree life goodbye and hello to responsibility of being uncle, big brother, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review61279">
        father all at once.<br />
<br />
Judging by the title of the series, there&#039;s not much to expect and could seem to be quite predictable. &quot;Listen to me Girls, I am Your Father!&quot; But let&#039;s face the music, here...how many of you actually listen to your parents when you were little? (I know, I didn&#039;t). And going from there, we have the first episode where at the ending, one of our main characters (Sora Takanashi) is caught with her pants down literally. Now, you&#039;re probably thinking about dropping the series at this point as it might turn into an &quot;ecchi&quot; series. Well, dead wrong.<br />
<br />
You see, in this story, we have our main character, the carefree Yuuta Segawa (also known affectionately as &quot;uncles&quot; by our cute little Hina). Of course, judging by just that, we might have our &quot;kawaiiiii&quot; moments running through our heads. Then, we have the middle child Miu Takanashi who causes mischievious deeds throughout the series for &quot;uncles&quot; and Sora. And finally, who could forget our tsundere-like Sora? I mean, the first scene we see her with uncles gets her pants caught down literally! <br />
<br />
Despite all that&#039;s mentioned above, there is much more depth into this series than meets the eye. From a tragic news of the morning comes forth an unprecedented event that will change uncles&#039; life forever. I mean, how would you feel if you certainly realized that someone you once knew disappear from the face of this Earth? <br />
<br />
With the surprising turn of events, it is clear now that this series has a much in depth theme, the theme of responsibility and be someone you never thought you&#039;d be: a father, an uncle, and a big brother. <br />
<br />
Despite this though, there are still those fan-service scenes popping up occasionally such as Sora&#039;s untimely undressing and morning wake up calls. Then, there is our Raika girl, the strange girl with boobs that makes Sora&#039;s look like marbles. At this point, some of our viewers may have pushed that &quot;dropped&quot; button on their anime list. With the common usage of fan-service we see in nearly God-knows-what % of anime we see these days, it&#039;s not surprising. However, if you watch the series carefully, you may notice that this series eventually shows its true visage. <br />
<br />
That visage is being the emotional and drama side of the show. It is deep as the series progresses. It is emotional as we see some of the more vulnerable sides of our characters. It is dramatic in the way how events turns out to be. And it is reality, not a dream. <br />
<br />
Seriously, if you or most people were in Yuuta&#039;s shoes, it would of been something that you wish and wish was a bad dream and wake up to a morning coffee. But mornings will never be the same again with these three girls under your roof. <br />
<br />
Beyond that, there are also some insightful side characters of the series some of us may want to keep their eyes on. (not just our hot girl Raika) For instance, the lolicon Sako who&#039;s there for the comic relif, the ladies man Nimura that has some great chemistry with Miu, and last but not least is  Raika that skyrockets Sora&#039;s tsundere sense like no tomorrow. Despite her relatively short appearances, it is clear that her view in this series has touched the hearts and our minds (no, not just with her appearance) but by her interactions with the other characters.<br />
<br />
As for the art and sound, I would say that both are just average and not award worthy of the year. I mean, it is just there. Of course, the light themed piano tone of the background occasionally does mix in with the series well but overall, not something I&#039;ll remember by for a long time. The art (like most 2010+ series) is presented well. However, there are those scenes where they background and obscene characters looks like computer generated graphics that leads to a turn off. <br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;d say that this was a great series that debuted so far. It has its good (the realism of taking care of people and becoming someone you never thought you&#039;d be). It has its bad (the pointless fan-service and some blend character designs). And then it has the ability to make our viewers continue to watch through its drama that all started after an unprecedented tragedy. What originally thought by some viewers (you know who you are) to be a series that tried to get attention through common cliche instead became a series of a touching melancholy. Perhaps, responsibility changes people who they are from carefree to responsible. Perhaps, it is unprecedented events that leads to people to discover their identity. Or perhaps, it is the reality that most of us may face today in our lives that can be reflected upon from this series. But all in all, this series is something to keep an eye on (especially since it only covers roughly 1/3 of the light novels). Remember, responsibility is not a privilege, it is a right. Don&#039;t believe me? Just ask Peter Parker.<br />

    If you plan to watch this anime with the assumption you&#039;ll get a lot of moe loli-fanservice, then you&#039;ll be sad to know that there isn&#039;t much of it.<br />
<br />
What you do get however, is a very deep, touching story, that&#039;s very thoughtfully written. It tackles a lot of different, difficult topics and approaches them in a very realistic manner. The result is a very sweet anime that breaks from the norm and is a great optimistic, thought-provoking watch.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t say any more here as nothing much needs to be said. Watch with low-expectations (as I did at the beginning) and you&#039;ll be sure to have

&quot;Family must not be separated, they must be together&quot; - Segawa Yuuta<br />
<br />
Raising a child isnt an easy matters, even for parents. Sometimes we must realize that if we&#039;re in our parents position and what do they feel when taking care of us, of course it isnt an easy things to do. So, can you imagine if we&#039;re a college student but at the same time we must taking care for 3 children? Segawa Yuuta knows the answer.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
STORY 9/10<br />
<br />
The story begins with Segawa Yuuta as the Main lead, he is a freshman of a university. His parents passed away while he was young and he got

          <span style="display: none;" id="review108289">
        cared by his own sisters. and One day, he is visiting to his sister&#039;s apartement because he got asked to take care of her three daughter while Yuri (his sister) and her husband were on trip. and then the problem occured, His sister and her husband got a plane crash during the trip, and so, the three daughter will being live separately because of the family want they do so, and to prevent that happen, Yuuta decided to take all the three girls and live with them.<br />
<br />
If you have watch Usagi Drop, then maybe this will kinda remembering you. a man adopted girls (but in Usagi Drop there was just one girl) because he is kinda sorry about what happen with her and back to the Papa no Iukoto,  the story is focussing on their life like what you&#039;re gonna do with your life, since now you&#039;re taking care of 3 children. you must thinking about their food, their school, and even their happiness, can you do that? So does this life story was BORING? NO WAY&#039;D HELL. The story is really maginificent, the problem that occured each episode is real, quite logic and not exaggerating. There is no drama that is excessive, they&#039;re just life or we can said more common life problems<br />
<br />
For me, every each episode in Papakiki so tear jerking moments. I couldnt help to shed my tears. and honestly, while watching this i must have handerkerchief on my side (kinda embarassed). Because the way how this anime tells the story is really touchy. The slow paced story that this anime brings really increasing the atmosphere.<br />
<br />
<br />
ART 8/10<br />
<br />
The art in this anime is really colorful and bright. The characters design is quite attractive and simply charming.<br />
One anime comes to my mind while watching this anime was &quot;Mayoi Neko Overrun&quot;, the art is so similar between this two anime, the girl is depicted cute. they use so many colour in the art (like three different colour hair in Takanashi sisters), and with this of course, the viewer who&#039;re watching this will never feel dull about this anime and more, the scenery or background is really good, like that i said, so colourful and i presume , it brings the atmosphere is cheerful and happy.<br />
<br />
But with this art, its didnt really fit it with an heartwarming atmosphere. Colorful and bright coloring is more suitable if the anime is focussing on cheerful and happy moments. However, its not quite a problem since we might be distracted by how beautiful and colorful this art was.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND 8/10<br />
<br />
Again, i am surprise how good the seiyuu was in this anime. especially for Takanashi Hina&#039;s voice. the sound was so childish like any 3 years old girl and more, the other Seiyuu like the seiyuu for Takanashi Sora is really talented, while she was singing, the sound was clearly like a profesional singer. What i mean is, they really put their feelings into it, i was moved by how much effort that they do and the result like you can estimate, it was perfect.<br />
<br />
As for OP and ED, honestly i more like to hear the ED song, i am not saying the OP was bad, but the ED song was really more fits with the anime. i dont know what make ED more fits with the anime, but i have feeling towards this ED song. it brings happiness yet sometimes it was sorrowful (mixed feelings).<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTER 9/10<br />
<br />
This probably what i loved the most from this anime, they really brings out the character. like the three sisters, they really unified with each other like the siblings must to be. and what make this series more interesting was of course, the little takanashi, Hina. We cant help not to in love with her. Cheerful and yet funny little girl. and that Hina itself that brings the atmosphere more lively and yet make the sad atmosphere, like when she asking where her mother and father is... if you&#039;re in Yuuta position, what will you said?<br />
<br />
Not just the Hina itself that appealing me, Every characters that appears in this anime (except someone, you will find it in below) was the real reason too why i love the character in this anime, here is the summary for each character (especially Takanashi sisters and Yuuta) :<br />
<br />
- Takanashi Sora, maybe the most character that have so much appearance in this anime, this character was lovely. As being the oldest sister between the three, she trying so hard so the other sisters will be like her and yet her shyness and tsundere toward Yuuta was reasonable, you will find it why i am not gonna spoil it.<br />
<br />
- Takanashi Miu, if there was a character that i love after Hina, it must be Miu. i am surprise how mature Miu was, toward her act even her manner. sometimes i thought Miu was the older sister. and yet, she is a mediator between Yuuta and Sora, since she knows that his older sister have a feeling towards Yuuta<br />
<br />
- Yuuta Segawa, i am impressed by how hardwork that he does for his niece (the three sisters), since he&#039;s just a student but he&#039;s also work for them and he really does it like a real man. Not wimpy character and even never give up. He can be a example for every man in the world. That the man must never give up. Do what you think is important.<br />
<br />
- Raika Oda, the woman that will makes you falling in love in her. it attractive and even Kuudere! , behind that, she is like Miu, mature in every ways.<br />
<br />
I want to give this section 10, but there is one problem that ruins it all. that is the president of SS club, pervert and even i dont know why he must appears in this series, as for me he doesnt give any positive to this and even ruins every scene if he is appear, if he never exist i thought that this anime will be more awesome.<br />
<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION<br />
<br />
I have regret on this anime... it was.. WHY I DIDNT KNOW THIS ANIME SOONER? when i found this anime i was like found a hidden gem/diamond in many of mainstream anime. This anime is totally recommended for all people who loves heartwarming anime with a light story on it.<br />
<br />

    Man, what the hell is an &quot;Ecchi&quot; tag doing on this anime?<br />
<br />
This anime has all the components of a successful emotional anime. It deals with the themes of loss, family and survival in a mature way and can make you tear up at more than one point, while portraying daily life of the protagonist with a sense of realism and without the tropes found in many anime.<br />
<br />
If there was no &quot;but&quot; following this anime might be considered a mini-Clannad by those who viewed it. <br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
The writers inexplicably decide that a show about loss, family and perseverance is somehow the  right time to add run-of-the-mill

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180140">
        pantie shots and incest humor. It&#039;s as perplexing as it is infuriating.<br />
<br />
Now don&#039;t get me wrong. I am a... purveyor... of many a pantie shot and clumsy-airhead-girl humor bit. I don&#039;t immediately cry &quot;FANSERVICE&quot; and dismiss an entertaining anime. But I still have no need to have a tear in my eye as we watch a three year old learn the cold facts about death, and then ten minutes later watch a 12 year old tsundere&#039;s older cousin complex.

    **Warning: Contains minor spoilers**<br />
<br />
If you want a comedy that&#039;s full of ecchi fan service involving children as well as loli vibes throughout the anime, look no further. You&#039;ve found what you are looking for. If that&#039;s not something that would interest you, I don&#039;t recommend this anime. If you&#039;re still on the fence about it and/or want to hear what I have to say, then please read the rest of my review. <br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
<br />
The voice acting was fine and the music was appropriate. Nothing special, though, and nothing really stood out to me. There were some cute moments when they were singing, but otherwise it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212285">
        forgettable. The voice actors did a good job of portraying their characters, so I have no complaints on that score either. <br />
<br />
Art:  6/10<br />
<br />
The art always felt familiar, like I&#039;d seen it somewhere before. Then I realized that (in my opinion at least) Sako looked exactly like Kouta Hirano from Highschool of the Dead. Sora looks similar Haruhi (The Meloncholy of Haruhi Suzumiya). Hina looked like a mini version of Taiga (Toradora) with black hair. Nimura looks like Koizumi from Haruhi Suzumiya. Miu&#039;s looks kind of remind me of Asuza Nanako (K-on).Etc...Seriously all of them look like the replica of a character from a different anime. While the art was beautiful, it still felt very unoriginal. <br />
<br />
I also found it annoying that Yuuta is supposed to be a college student, yet he looks the same age as 14 year old Sora. in the anime Yuuta is 18, making him 4 years older than Sora, so way does he look her age and sometimes younger than her? There are also times I feel that they made the 10 year old, Miu, look older than she was. Same with Hina. She looked more like a five or six year old than a three year old. I suppose if they drew people to match their ages, then the comedy and acceptance of that comedy wouldn&#039;t work as well? I don&#039;t know...moving on....<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
<br />
First, let me say that I have not read the manga, nor do I intend to, so this is all based solely on my impressions of the anime (and the three ova). <br />
<br />
What makes this anime so sad is that it had such great potential. As the synopsis states, it&#039;s a about an 8 year old college freshman who takes in his three nieces (two of which aren&#039;t blood-related) after his sister and her husband&#039;s plane goes missing (and they are presumed dead - which they are). Sounds like it could be a really good anime, right? That&#039;s what I thought too. I was wrong. It was far from being a great anime, or even good or average anime, which is a shame. <br />
<br />
This story truly could have been something great. The premise was a good one and I wanted to see it develop into something deep and meaningful (even with the genre of comedy attached to it). This simply was not to be as the powers that be ruined it with unneeded and tasteless fan service, along with some characters that were better off never being in the show given their behavior and how said behavior dragged the show into the dirt. I understand that this is a comedy and they were trying to be lighthearted, but I just felt it was done poorly. Very poorly. <br />
<br />
The fan service was way to much for me to handle considering the premise of the show. I feel that this anime should have an ecchi lolicon warning label attached to it, so people can know about that aspect before going into for people (like me) who tries not to read reviews before watching the anime.<br />
<br />
Let me warn you: There are A LOT of bath scenes. There are also plenty panty shots, boob shots, etc...a good majority of which center on the little girls (ages 3, 10, and 14). I didn&#039;t care for this aspect of the anime. Maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;m a mother of two young children myself or maybe it&#039;s because I simply don&#039;t think little girls should be sexualized. Either way, the fan service added nothing meaningful to the plot and ended up leaving me feeling as if I had just seen something I had no business seeing. <br />
<br />
To add insult to injury they just had to add pedophilia to the mix . Because what ecchi lolicon anime would it be without a pedophile(or two) that no one is really bothered by? That&#039;s what that particular tv trope (the lolicon trope) is all about, after all. <br />
<br />
However, I didn&#039;t find it humorous. It had the complete opposite effect, actually. When that aspect came to life, I lost interest in the anime and simply watched it just to say I finished it. Using pedophilia as a joke isn&#039;t funny to me at all. So not only did it have a lot of ecchi fan service of young girls, but also pedophile elements that we were supposed to find amusing. I am not amused. Not to all. <br />
<br />
It didn&#039;t help that the woman, Raika, struck me as being something of a pedophile herself. I can&#039;t be sure if her love and affection for the girls is platonic or not. The OVA seems to suggest something more (for some weird reason one of the OVAs seemed to turn all the girls in the show into some type of pseudo-lesbians).  Innocent or not, Raika&#039;s behavior was no easier to shallow than Sako&#039;s disturbing behavior towards the girls. Both of them had an unhealthy obsession with them that, again, seemed to bother no one, yet bothered me as a viewer greatly.  <br />
<br />
Characters: 3/10 <br />
<br />
Outside of the pedophile aspect of some characters, two more examples of useless characters in this anime are the landlady&#039;s daughter who tries to evict them simply because he took in his sister&#039;s kids, and Raika (her loli moments aside) was someone I just never understood and never found funny. Maybe I just don&#039;t get the humor in this anime? I mean, who would try to evict someone for attempting to do the responsible thing? While the anime tried to explain her harsh behavior, the execution was done badly and to be honest, every time she was on screen I couldn&#039;t stop getting distracted by how she was practically the glasses-wearing version of Karan from No. 6 (anime). <br />
<br />
As far as I can tell the friends (Raika, Sako, and Nimura) contributed next to nothing to the anime and often were shown in a poor light when they were given screen time (though my definition of poor light may vary greatly from yours). The only one of the three I found even remotely likable was Nimura, but even so, the way everyone thinks these kids are cute and practically seem to fall in love with them is a put-off. Even if Nimura&#039;s true intentions are innocent, sometimes it just doesn&#039;t feel that way. In reality, it makes me question if everyone in the show is a lolicon in some form or another. <br />
<br />
I also hated how the girls always said that Yuuta lacked delicacy. I didn&#039;t see that. If anything, they should have been more understanding of him and realized that more often than not they were at equal fault whenever something happened that put them in an awkward situation. <br />
<br />
I found it annoying that Yuuto had taken them all in so the sisters could stay together when no one else would do that only for them to treat him so badly because he was a boy. I get that they are young girls, but there&#039;s a limit to how childish you can be. Yet Yuuta never chastised them for it and went along with their whims, which bothered me even more as he&#039;s supposed to be the adult. Instead, he allowed them to treat him like an inferior and even apologize to them when he&#039;d done nothing wrong. <br />
<br />
Example: when Yuuta offered to help Sora with her luggage because he was afraid she&#039;d fall. She refused and, go figure, she fell down the stairs. When she fell the clothes in the luggage went flying and he accidentally picked up her panties. She gets embarrassed and slaps him, for which he apologizes. I&#039;m sorry, but how was that his fault? I didn&#039;t find that funny, I just found it stupid.<br />
<br />
As for character development, I didn&#039;t really see too much. While it was definitely there, considering the premise of the anime, a lot more character growth should have taken place. Instead serious events or issues that would have helped them grow as people were often glossed over or ignored for irrelevant material that has no business being in an anime centering on children for the purposes of comedy or whatever it was the creators thought to do with it. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/10 <br />
<br />
I enjoyed the anime until the point that the bad humor and excessive fan service became too much for me to continue enjoying it. As already stated, the excessively ecchi fan service and the lolicon vibe of the anime made me feel uncomfortable while watching this. They are little girls. There&#039;s nothing funny about lolicon in this situation (or any situation really). <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t imagine any normal person wanting to see little girls taking baths or seeing their panties or boobs or naked skin. They are kids. That&#039;s not cute. This is what really ruined it for me. Even with a good plot, there was no way I could force myself to enjoy it. I ended up feeling very disconnected from the characters and the anime the more I watched and was tempted to drop it a couple times. <br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10<br />
<br />
Despite the good plot, I did not like this anime. The humor was distasteful and the use of fan service in regards to little girls made me uneasy. I feel that a great plot was largely ruined for worthless tropes that lowered the anime from something that could have been great to barely tolerable. At times, yes it was cute. At times, yes, the plot was wonderful. Sadly, it wasn&#039;t enough nor am I able to overcome my own personal bias to rate this higher. <br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t mind kids being used as ecchi fan service material and pedophile tropes don&#039;t bother you then you should do fine with this anime. In fact, there&#039;s no reason you wouldn&#039;t love it. However, if things like that bother you as they do me, then I suggest skipping this anime, no matter how tempting the premise is. Had I known before startinf the anime about these details, I would have skipped it myself. It&#039;s just not worth it.  At times such as these, reading some of the reviews before watching can really go a long way.<br />
<br />
While I understand this is just an anime and that I probably need to lighten up, I can&#039;t find it in me to do that. Therefore, my score of 5/10. That&#039;s the best I can give it, based purely on the premise (that was wasted), the sound, and the copy-cat art that reminds me keenly of other anime, sometimes to the point of distraction. <br />
<br />
If I was going to rate this as I really want to, I&#039;d give it a three out of ten, but I&#039;m not going to be that cynical. It did have it&#039;s good moments and it wasn&#039;t necessarily a bad anime. I&#039;m sure there are many people who would (and do) love it and find it fun to watch. I am not one of them. That&#039;s not saying that the anime sucks or that I have poor taste. It&#039;s just that in this instance, I found that I simply couldn&#039;t enjoy it personally. So again, 5/10 is the best I can do in my overall rating and even that is being too generous in light of my personal qualms with the anime.  <br />
<br />
I hope that this review was helpful to you. Thank you for reading it. <br />

    I just want to say that I am really happy to see that this will be getting 26 episodes. It is really vibrant and cute.<br />
<br />
<br />
The story revolves around our main protagonist who has to take care of his sister&#039;s 3 kids (although 2 of them are not blood related, they came from the sister&#039;s husbands 2 previous marriages, so technically none of the girls are related to each other).<br />
<br />
<br />
I started reading this manga a few weeks ago and I was SO happy to see that this season would have the anime version of it along with other great series (Zero no tsukaima, Youko x Boku

          <span style="display: none;" id="review51535">
        SSS, Highschool DxD and I think there was one more).<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10. It&#039;s a cute story where the uncle enjoys his daily life with the 3 kids and they all become a happy family. I don&#039;t want to spoil anything so I won&#039;t say why it&#039;s a Harem genre (but you can probably tell already).<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10. Seeing how this is a 2012 anime the art has to be good, and it really is. The details they put into the characters are really something. For instance, when yuuta walks into the room of one of the girls changing the red blush on her face/body is really noticeable. That&#039;s one thing that really stood out to me.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10. I don&#039;t recall the OP but I listened to the Ending and it&#039;s really cute and sweet. I tend not to watch OP/ED since the show is already over or you just want to heart of the show, not the OP lol. There&#039;s only certain OP/ED I will watch (for instance Fairy Tails Ending where Gray is walking a path and reminiscing about the past, the music and animation is really nice so I actually watched it every time for that season. Also the OP of Mirai Nikki is AMAZING, the animation too).<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10. Your typical cute family harem comedy. It&#039;s very nice and the 3 girls are very charming and have great personalities. Yuuta starts off as a typical &quot;why the f*ck do I have to watch these 3 kids when I just want to be a normal college kid&quot; (BUT IT&#039;S A VERY MILD CASE).<br />
<br />
He&#039;s not a douche about it. He cares for the girls and I don&#039;t want to spoil anything but if you&#039;ve read the manga you know that he goes out of his way a lot to make sure that the girls are all happy and comfortable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10. If you enjoy cute/family comedy harems then this is a great show. It&#039;s not a hardcore incestual/lolicon harem show at all. It&#039;s just a cute little comedy that brings people together :)<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
<br />
Great show. Great everything. I look forward to the next 25 episodes.<br />
<br />
<br />
I probably won&#039;t have to update this in the future since I&#039;ve already read a bit of the manga so I know what happens sorta. Please enjoy the show if you do watch it :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading

                  Today I’ll be reviewing one of Sentai’s newest works, Papa no Iu Koto o Kikinasai! or PapaKiki for short. Much like the critically acclaimed Usagi Drop, this slice of life anime involves a young man whos world turns upside down when he finds himself a guardian due to unforeseen circumstances. Unlike PapaKiki, however, Usagi Drop was actually an enjoyable experience. There are so many things wrong with PapaKiki, it was almost unwatchable for me.<br />
              The premise itself doesn’t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review104675">
        seem too bad at face value. The main character Yuta is a college student who decides to take in his older sister’s 3 kids after she disappears in a plane crash along with her husband. However, this is where holes start to pop up. There is zero emotional impact with the disappearance because we barely got to know Yuta’s older sister at all and her husband straight up never appears onscreen. But it isn’t until the memorial service that things get REALLY ridiculous. After hearing that the sisters will be separated and sent off with different relatives Yuta takes a huge leap and offers to take them all in so they’ll be together. It’s a heartfelt idea, but ultimately unreasonable, right? Well apparently not because the adults LET IT HAPPEN. Forget the fact that the dude is attending college and working at the same time. Forget the fact that other, more responsible family members are willing to take in the young ones. Forget the fact that Yuta literally has only spent a couple days with the kids at that point. Nope, let em all stay in a cramped,one bedroom apartment. Needless to say, Hijinks ensue! Well, not really. <br />
               The 3 sisters are 14 year old Sora, 10 year old Miu, and 3 year old Hina. Sora is a tsundere with a brother-complex..er..adopted brother…uhm father complex? Long story short she wants Yuta’s D , because whats an anime without incest vibes? Id mention more about her but besides the fact that she has a slight resemblance to Haruhi there IS nothing else to mention about her character. Miu is the most tolerable of the 3 even though she does fuck all the entire time. There’s one episode focused directly on her but she mostly just chills in the background. Hina however, is in my opinion, not only the most annoying character in the series but the most unbearable anime character in recent memory. With a voice that manages to be high pitched yet grating at the same time, her overly “cutesy” behavior, and her predilection for breaking out into “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” (I swear to fuck she sings that at LEAST 60 times during the course of the series) Hina never fails to infuriate me just by being on screen. There are a few other characters but they’re so cookie cutter that I didn’t even bother to remember their names. There’s a beautiful girl who’s super popular in school but takes an interest in Yuta for no apparent reason even though she’s way out of his league. The good looking, womanizing best friend. And the fat, creepy, glasses wearing nerd…who’s also a lolicon. (of course)<br />
             Animation and character design is bland and even downright confusing at times. For example, Hina has a full head of hair that goes down to her lower back even though she’s only 3 and all the characters seem to have permanent red marks on their knees and elbows. The fan service is also a problem. There isn’t nearly enough to satisfy the lolicon pervs but there’s still enough to get an eyeroll from the people who actually want to pay attention to the story. OP isn’t bad but ultimately forgettable. The ED however is damn catchy. An 8bit-like tune that reminds me of 90’s Gameboy games. Though in retrospect, the fact that the ED signaled to me that my 24 minutes of brain rape were over is also probably part of the reason I liked it so much. <br />
<br />
Pros- Fat lolicon dude gets a few chuckles now and again<br />
          Ending song is Ipod worthy<br />
<br />
Cons- HINA<br />
            Premise a bit too unbelievable<br />
            HINA<br />
            Full of clichés and character tropes<br />
            HOLY SHIT, HINA DIEEEEE                  <br />

    Can a university student &quot;take responsibility&quot; and become a parent for three troublesome girls after their real parents have left the world?<br />
<br />
Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai! is a bittersweet and tragic story about responsibility with a minor seasoning of rom-com to keep the story at a minimal level of depression. <br />
<br />
Though this could be considered as another slice of life rom-com. The sprinkles of misery really makes up for its genericity. The sad parts of the story aside, the slice of life aspects of this show wasn&#039;t so bad as well. In fact, it was kawaii. Very, very much kawaii.<br />
<br />
Loved this. Undoubtedly 10/10. Recommended to

    Do you like anime about family bonding, growing up, and learning life lessons--then you should watch this anime. Family can be blood related or not as it doesn&#039;t matter. Family is a family. Its the time you spent with them that count and the memories you share.  I am reminded of another anime  Usagi Drop that has a similar feeling. Anyway on to the story--Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai! or Listen to Me, Girls. I Am Your Father!. is about Segawa Yuuta , a 19 year college student has to take care of his sister&#039;s 3 children. ( 1 of them is blood

          <span style="display: none;" id="review52745">
        related while the other 2 are not related)  One might think this is a harem/ecchi  type anime-(as stated above) deals with life lessons that everyone should learn from. <br />
<br />
Art/Characters <br />
I say its good, everyone has their own unique feel and charm about them<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Opening song is very touching and it shows the relationship between Yuuta and his 3 sisters. Ending song is cute- showcasing the 3 sisters- cute charm/appeal : ) One more thing--its really colorful : )<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
I believe yuuta and his 3 sister will have a very close bond. Everyone who enjoys slice of life anime that deals with life and learning life&#039;s preciousness lessons should watch this series. Give it a chance  :  )<br />

    We&#039;re pushed into a story where it starts calm, then the sad part hits. To some, they might tear, I completely understand the motive behind each character&#039;s decision, but it really doesn&#039;t drag me into the main story much as I didn&#039;t care for the characters that much during the beginning, I had enpathy for them but caring was still lacking.<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t a AAA+ action anime, it&#039;s realistic modern day Japan, so all the actions or... most of the non-sexual ones seem logical to me. The jokes are funny at first but they&#039;re overused way too much throughout the series. <br />
<br />
The three sisters are all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191096">
        cute, a tsundere, a toddler and the pretty one, all lolis of course. But there comes a time when their actions also become overused, with the exception of Mia, the pretty one as she is slightly less predictable than the other two. The incest related relationship seems at first uncomfortable to me, but as the story progress I grew... not attached at all but more accepting of it. The sexual joke scenes seems awkwardly placed, kinda enjoyable, but it just made attachments with characters slightly loosen and I couldn&#039;t take the serious scenes completely serious. You have two female characters that you meet... and you will most likely not care at all for them as they have less than five minutes of screen time in the entire series even though they have a slight side effect to the main characters. There&#039;s also another female character, she&#039;s supposedly has the best body out of all the female characters, however her body hardly seems different from the two other female characters if you know what I mean. She appears in almost every episode and no one knows what her motives are or why she possesses an interest in the main male protagonist, the type of interest isn&#039;t even determined either. The show is mostly about the male protagonist but the scenes where he&#039;s at work or college seems like the most pointless scenes.<br />
<br />
The anime sports a lot of cute but random occurences, it&#039;s hard to get into, but I managed to be able to get into it. The sad or bad moments are painfully predictable and when they actually come, I didn&#039;t feel surprised at all at the timing, I only just wonder &quot;What kind of trouble are they in now?&quot;. I only feel a little bad at their reactions to the situations, I didn&#039;t shed a tear.<br />
<br />
With situations resolved I feel only a little happy for the characters, then the ending music plays and I feel that it multiplies that happy feeling much more. I love the ending so much, both the animation and the music.<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t an overly fantastic anime, it had a lot of potential but a lot of holes appear in the plot. Plus a lot of pointless characters... but those pointless characters add to the realism in a way because in most other animes every single character is friends with each other, this anime shows slight realism that shows that not everyone know everyone else because they&#039;re linked. The characters also seem to become attached too quickly, it takes one episode for a character to become best friends with another, or a certain five minute moment makes a girl fall in love with a guy for the rest of her life. They could of had a lot of plot twists in this anime that would of made it way better, but it isn&#039;t and it makes it painfully predictable and not surprising at all, mixing with strangely timed fanservice, it all ruined attachment to characters. If you happen to get into it, it&#039;s great and enjoyable to watch, if you can&#039;t you&#039;re looking rock bottom as they&#039;d say.<br />

    Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasa is something as close to a Masterpiece as you will find in an Anime Series.<br />
<br />
If you read the description on what this is about, or translated the title that in English means &quot;Listen to Me, Girls. I Am Your Father!&quot; <br />
<br />
Yuri and Shingo are going on a Honeymoon when their plane hits bad weather and crashed, Killing both of them.<br />
Their 3 kids now have no parents, Would you a College student, have the guts, the courage to stand forth after hearing that the 3 girls would be split up, To take matters into your own hands?<br />
<br />
It takes a special kid

          <span style="display: none;" id="review75987">
        of person, and that is Segawa Yuuto, He stood up to the family members and said he wants ALL 3 and will look after them.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Yuuto for one you see a change in him, he has to go from a careless college guy, so a person that now cares for 3 girls, works extra jobs and does college as well, you can see the pressures and the strains this can cause, He becomes a MAN during this time, and its sooo easy to see, even the girl he has a crush on can see the change in him, a good change at that.<br />
For the other characters they are perfect, From the 3 kids, Hina is the one that makes this series, she is 3 and thus comes alot of innocence, but this innocence can sometimes be very funny and amusing, then it could be Heart warming (When she wants to learn something to show Mummy and Daddy when they are back) and the next terribly sad.<br />
Even the sub-characters are amazing and portrayed perfectly, they fit the show and help out when they can, but are NEEDED, Friends can help you in life, and this series shows that.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Is Sublime, One of the better looking series i have seen in a while, Even down the little quirks they give Hina (3 Year Old) is soo cute.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Voice&#039;s REALLY fit the characters, a perfect job there, only downside is the music was good nothing that was incredibly memorable though.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
All i need to say, Is watch this series right away, Its something Special, One of the best series i have seen.<br />
I have been thinking of Lines and Lines to say about this, But there is no need, To sum it up, Everything is done in a sublime fashion, and you will miss one of the best series around if you don&#039;t watch this.<br />
<br />
(Soooooooooooo Wish for a Season II) :(<br />
<br />

    Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai! A somewhat difficult show to review. Decent premise, some good characters, pretty art, but still doesn&#039;t really convince me it worked as a show.<br />
<br />
The story is a relatively interesting premise. Yuuta ends up taking in 3 of his nieces after their parents die, to stop them going off to different homes and ultimately being separated, he feels so strongly about this because his older sister and the mother of the youngest niece raised him when their own parents died. As you may have guessed from the last sentence Yuuta is only blood related to one of the girls.<br />
<br />
The biggest issue

          <span style="display: none;" id="review78986">
        i have with this show is that it tries to draw upon far to many ideas and genres, for a half series to really succeed with any of them. Sometimes it wants to be a slice of life drawing upon all the hardships of a poor college student trying to raise 3 girls on his own, other times it pushes lots of screen time into Yuuta&#039;s college life, mainly the strange club he joins and the love interest there with Raika, other times it wants to run with the oldest sister Sora having romantic feelings for Yuuta, and heads down the whole possible incest route. Then it remembers it could just flood the show with fan service and cute moments. The way the theme changes often several times in any one given episode makes it very difficult to really get into the show, given you&#039;ll probably like 1 or 2 aspects and be unhappy when it strongly overplays the others.<br />
<br />
If you look at some of the more popular shows with this sort of subject matter most of them succeed by largely focusing on one theme and running all others as small scale extras, Usagi drop quickly jumps to mind, for keeping its focus to great success.<br />
<br />
I liked the characters, the youngest sister Hina is cuteness overkill, Miu is crafty and wise well beyond her apparent age of 10, and Sora the oldest sister is semi in love with Yuuta, which will appeal to some.<br />
<br />
Art is pretty good, i&#039;m genuinely excited Feel are doing the new Minami-ke based on this showing. Art is distinctive, bright and generally well drawn.<br />
<br />
In conclusion this sounded a great idea, that didn&#039;t really come off with all the demographics it&#039;s tried to cater for and squeeze into a relatively short run time.<br />
<br />

    I&#039;m not one for reviews that are college-length dissections of anime so I&#039;ll try to keep my review short without leaving out much about how I see Papa to go for viewers.<br />
<br />
Generalizing to three types of viewers:<br />
1. Those who can&#039;t stand fan service (disproportionate women, pedophiles, inappropriate comedy, etc) and want to see a PROPER story told (like me): I&#039;ll get to that in the end.<br />
2. Those who like a good plot and don&#039;t mind fan service: This anime is for you. I can guarantee you&#039;ll give it an 8/10 or more.<br />
3. Those of you who only care for fan service: This isn&#039;t a bad

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178660">
        anime for it, it&#039;s got a quite the range of it. I can&#039;t say much more because I hate that nonsense/ weirdo stuff.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai is nothing but wasted potential. It presents a great collection of issues and situations that could have played out to be one of the best stories ever told, but every time it started to blossom the animators RUINED IT with fan service (the kinds stated above). If it were not for the good moments that stuck to the plot, this would&#039;ve gotten a 1/10 from me.<br />
But again, that is only my opinion. In the end, if you are on the fence about it, see where you fit in in the 3 categories of viewers and go according to that.

    If you have ever fantasized about what would happen if suddenly you became the guardian of 3 little girls out of nowhere, then this might just be your anime. <br />
<br />
|Objective Review|<br />
<br />
|Story/Plot|<br />
The overall story is very well organised and presented throughout the whole series. The core idea is presented and developed at a great pace, maintaining variety. While the main idea might not seem too interesting at first, Papa still makes it exciting. Papa puts the characters to great use to make sure the flood of problems stay fresh and varied. Though there are a couple of flaws here and there (see at Characters). The anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256380">
        ending is not particularly great, but it can be forgiven if you watch the OVA and specials which give it a proper ending.<br />
Score - 7 (9 with OVA and specials)<br />
<br />
|Comedy|<br />
Expect to see some minor comedy in the anime. Nothing too spectacular, it&#039;s just there to spice things up. However, the jokes can become repetitive and boring after awhile since they use the same concept and ideas for jokes. <br />
<br />
|Characters|<br />
The characters are the most integral part of Papa and it succeeds to deliver. Almost all of the main characters are great, none of them are shallow characters. They all have deep/multi-layered personalities and they made them feel real, making it easy to like them all. <br />
The supporting characters on the other hand are very-very supporting characters. Most of them are just one of the basic stereotypes and don&#039;t really show anything beyond those. <br />
As the series go, the main characters build deep bonds and their character develop into more depth. My only concern was the lack of attention for Miu both in terms of connections and character development. The same goes for the support characters.<br />
Score - 8<br />
<br />
|Art|<br />
The art is one of the best ones. Not really because it&#039;s beautiful in art terms, but because it complements the story and ambiance so well. It&#039;s bright, heart warming and cute. It really helps you ease into the mood of this anime.<br />
Score - 9<br />
<br />
|Sounds|<br />
The voice acting was pretty good in my opinion. There was character to them, i could feel the emotions behind them. As far as the music goes, i think it was good, but nothing outstanding. However, it still goes well with the heart warming charm of Papa.<br />
Score - 7<br />
<br />
|The whole package|<br />
As i have already implied, the audio-visuals just work so greatly together and Papa really has a great ambiance to it, which i can only recommend. All in all, if you would like to see how a &quot;newly-born&quot; family bonds over while overcoming all hurdles, melting hearts with how cute and lovely it is, then this anime is for you.<br />
Overall Score - 8<br />
<br />
<br />
|Subjective part|<br />
For me, who always wanted to have a loving family environment, where i felt comfortable, this anime was just incredibly heart warming for me. It really meant a lot for me, and seeing the family bond over all the issues was just an unimaginable dream for me. Not to mention the characters... They were all extremely lovable and i could really put myself into their shoes. Personally speaking i&#039;m still disappointed by the lack of Miu content but oh well. But because of all these, the anime will always have a place in my heart and i will give it a <br />
Subjective Overall Score - 10 (9 because of Miu)<br />

First of all, I would like to announce that I&#039;m an idiot for not finding this animation sooner, which is one of the better manga series I&#039;ve read. For Pete&#039;s sake, I&#039;m late for about three years. No use crying over spilled milk.<br />
<br />
I write this review assuming you&#039;ve watched the series. Worry not, it doesn&#039;t contain any spoilers. Oh and a little more, I&#039;ve been writing a lot of reviews on MAL but I didn&#039;t read one of the guideline, &quot;Don&#039;t include story summaries,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178361">
        users already have the synopsis written for them.&quot;. I am ashamed of what I&#039;ve been doing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Great job, dummy me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY 9/10<br />
To be frank, I wasn&#039;t expecting any serious plot about Papa no Iukoto when I read it on 2009. I thought, &quot;Lookie, lookie! Another harem series full of fan service and with three lolis in it!&quot; (Loli lovers raise yer hands!).<br />
After reading a few chapters of it; my perception about it instantaneously changed. I felt guilty judging it hastily.<br />
<br />
Papa no Iukoto wa Kikinasai&#039;s offers a different--- a heartwarming story which I find very entertaining. It&#039;s a little bit tragic. Good thing the series focused more on the cheerful side of the story. It tells us about responsibility. Well, technically, no one would do this kind of big--- I mean, ginormous responsibility in real life.  A 19-year-old kid taking care of three girls (two lolis and one adolescent girl, yes, I needed to clarify that) while studying at a university? Man, you have to be a superhuman to do that. Fortunately, this is just a show.<br />
<br />
We all know how hard it is, but nevertheless, Yuuta (MC) tries his hardest to take responsibility for the three girls. Yes, it&#039;s foolish. But for Yuuta, family&#039;s the most important thing. That&#039;s why he tries his hardest to provide for the three girls. Bearing this big of a responsibility is like climbing a tree, with just one arm. It might seem impossible, but with great effort, it&#039;s still doable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly speaking, Papa no Iukoto&#039;s a lot better than most of the series that I have watched. Storyline wise, it&#039;s one of the best. Not too much drama in it; but nonetheless, was still enough to bring a tear or two to my eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
The art is superb! Detailed characters, good background, and uhh--- okay, enough trying to be an art expert. Like I&#039;ve been saying in my previous reviews (dumb reviews), art that doesn&#039;t please the viewers these days are a rarity. And Papa no Iukoto&#039;s not an exception. The art is great, period.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND 9/10<br />
Oh my God. Kitamura Eri and Horie Yui for seiyuus? Heck, yeah! I immediately recognized their voices the first time I heard them.Takanashi Hina&#039;s (the smallest girl) seiyuu has done a great job too! Being able to voice a three-year-old girl is no easy feat, and she did it with flying colors. Other seiyuus were perfect for their characters.<br />
<br />
For the OP and ED. I. LOVE. THEM. BOTH. OP&#039;s done by Kitamura Eri; and the ED&#039;s done by Horie Yui!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS 8/10<br />
Cute--- no, fantastically cute! The designs on the girls were great. Especially Hina, she&#039;s the cutest character here. Anyway, every character in Papa no Iukoto is good. They have their own unique personality, which is good. Even the supporting characters were designed perfectly.<br />
<br />
Yuuta&#039;s a bit on the plain side, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT 8/10<br />
Did I enjoy it? Heck, I did! The slow development of the story didn&#039;t bother me that much. In fact, I liked it. Even though its a bit tragic, I love how simple the story has developed into. Every episode is filled with laughter, a bit drama, and heartwarming scenes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL 9/10<br />
Clearly speaking, Papa no Iukoto is one of the better shows out there. Its able to make you laugh and cry. It does not contain any heavy drama in it; and it doesn&#039;t have a complicated plot. We all watch to be entertained, no? It&#039;s just a matter of perspective. And if you happen to have the same perspective as I am, you&#039;ll love the show. Overall, it&#039;s a great show filled with cheerfulness and a bit of tragedy in it, just an itsy bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
Igarashi Hiromi, Hina&#039;s seiyuu, is a hentai seiyuu. She voiced Oni Chichi&#039;s Airi.

    [SPOILERS AHEAD] Sorry, but in order for me to write an honest in-depth review about this anime, I feel as though some spoilers from both the OVA AND THE LIGHT NOVEL are necessary. <br />
<br />
Story: (I am only talking about the 2nd ep not the first, the first is more or less a filler, plain fan service) In this part of the OVA, Miu, Hina, and Sora&#039;s parents come back as harmless ghosts for one day after 4 years since the incident. The whole episode is seen from their point of view and in this episode we see a whole bunch of changes between everyone and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191613">
        everything that occurred within the 4 years. <br />
<br />
Well after the outcry and the beggings of a 2nd season from the fans of this series, the studio gave us an OVA that is basically a translation of the final volume in the Light Novel. This was a HUGE mistake in my opinion. There should have been a 2nd season instead of 1 episode because the audience is suddenly introduced to MANY new things, and its just too much to take in! [THIS IS WHERE SPOILERS ARE IN] Especially the marriage between Sora and Yuta. WHAT? WAIT WHAT? Yep. The author pulls a COMPLETE USAGI DROP and makes the impossible happen with the ending. Now, for those of us who watched the OVA without reading the novel, its a complete &quot;What the fuck man?&quot; moment. Is this normal? What happened in the Light Novel that led up to this? Surely there must have been a good reason for Yuta to have married Sora instead of the beautiful Raika that he was so fit for. And after extensive research and readings into the Light Novel, I assure you that I am still going: &quot;What the fuck man.” In the Light Novel, turns out that Raika DOES like Yuta and starts to actively fight other heroines in order to get Yuta. Some of those Heroines include Sora, Miu (wat), Miu’s mother Sasha (wat), the neighbor across the street, and Yutas own college friend. Now, the light novels are not translated to the fullest, but tl;dr, Yuta ends up marrying Sora even though the girl of his dreams confesses to him.  <br />
<br />
Now, I do not want to instigate anything, nor do I want to judge other&#039;s perception of love, but this pairing was just preposterous. If you were to be suddenly in charge of taking care of your niece, since she was a pre-pubescent girl, in what stage of the relationship would you possibly have started to develop romantic feelings toward her? It does not matter that Yuta and Sora were not &quot;blood related&quot; the whole message that the first season taught us was that &quot;Family sticks together&quot; and this ending completely did a 180˙ turn. After having the audience hooked for 17 volumes, it is very insulting to be suddenly given an ending like this. It feels as though the author gives a final FUCK YOU to his or her fans. <br />
<br />
However, it would be very wrong for myself to judge this whole anime on this one part. The anime gives us a whole bunch of heartfelt, beautiful moments and it wouldn’t be fair for me to judge the whole thing based on the ending. But like I said, it was very disheartening to be seeing such an impossible and improbable ending happen. <br />
I will be giving this a 7/10 because the ending really did provide the audience with the closure that they needed since the first season ended and it more or less gives off the same vibes that we’ve gotten from before.  <br />

Papa no iukoto wo kikinasai, is a story based on Yutta dealing three siblings whose mother and father are missing (presumably dead) from plane crash.

Story: 8/10 <br />
It begins with Yutta going to collage and then attending the night party which he then fell asleep, then Sako pretendly accuses him for harrasing Raika whose really not that emotional. That was a good part, then all the sad

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184598">
        parts come through, his sister and her husband are missing in plane crash, making him tp take care the three siblings in his tiny apartment, lots and lots of thing happen there in his entire 12 episode life, from getting almost evicted to his apartment, Sora problems, Miu Problems, Hina problems, aunt coming checking by. Certainly it begin with sad plot but moving on you will have a heart feeling moments. <br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The art are decent, not too bright nor dim. Just right, perfect for the mood of the viewers, character designs were fine to me except for Yutta&#039;s hair but still it makes a perfect character trait for him.<br />
<br />
Sound:8/10<br />
All those OST are tear jerking and some are relaxing. OP and ED was so energized <br />
<br />
Characters:8/10<br />
I think Yutta Seiyuu did well but he could improve more if it could show more feelings rather than Huh, Hah,Hee? The rest Seiyuus are fine to me since Sora and Miu VA are from Working!! And Chuunibyou<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
At first i don&#039;t feel like watching it but because of the storyline was interesting and heart warming, I enjoyed watching it. Nevertheless, it helps me to learn what family is all about. Thank you for having animes because anime do really bring some morals.<br />
<br />
Overall:8/10<br />
<br />

    I am sure some producer in Japan watched Usagi Drop and thought &quot;This show would make a ton of more money if it only had more Moe!&quot;. So he found a novel for LtMGIYF and turned it into an anime. Change the main character from a mature adult to the standard insecure College student, replace the one little girl with 3 fitting different stereo types and add in some quirky friends and neighbors to replace the more normal secondary characters in Usagi Drop.<br />
<br />
When I first saw this show on the list for winter, my first thought was &quot;oh, no! not more Tsunderes and Ecchi&quot;. But

          <span style="display: none;" id="review53935">
        I checked out the first episode I was pleasantly surprised. There is really little to no Ecchiness (No panty shots, no nudity, no side boobs, some towel scenes and bare legs, but that is about it). All the girls ended up being being very polite and nice, if a little high strung. It still is a full tilt Moe fest however, and you should be prepared for that. In the end though, it is and adorable and entertaining show. It&#039;s sappy, sad, and humorous all at the same time. If you ever lost a parent at a young age, you&#039;ll probably cry your eyes out.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s still early, but if you are an adult and liked Usagi Drop, you&#039;ll like this show, though maybe not as much. If you are a young, have a short attention span and mentally block out serious situations, you might even like this better than Usagi Drop.

    I&#039;m 6&#039;7&quot;, and have a really deep voice. It takes a lot to make me cry, but this story got to me. I want a daughter, and this anime just made want 3. It has everything that captures a young girls innocence, crushes, and ways to deal with pain. I would also like to say that I am not a lolicon, but this anime makes me feel like being one. That sounded weird but it would make anyone feel even a little like that.

    Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai! is one of those animes that both lighten and enlighten your day: it tells you the story of a family caught in a very difficult moment and of a college student who goes out of his way to keep the three daughters of his sister together (yes, I know, two of them are stepdaughters), despite the hard time that this decision is going to give him. In fact the challenges will be numerous, but Yuuto (our MC) will make any sacrifice necessary for their happiness; and this is most certainly going to make you smile.<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10.<br />
The story is in my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190313">
        humble opinion one of the strong points of this anime. The plot is not at all complicated though, and it does not need to be, the situation is already tough enough for the girls: they discover that their parents&#039; flight has gone missing and that their life is going to radically change, with them almost surely divided among the other relatives. Yuuto intervenes and chooses to keep them all together in his rather small apartment: from that moment onwards there are very few major events, while the show concentrates on the dozens of real-life problems that this brave but maybe too light-hearted decision will bring on the new family, mostly a chronic lack of money, of time and of sleep. It&#039;s this focus on realism that got me: this show didn&#039;t need any sudden plot twist to keep you worrying and caring about the main characters; and even with the many little difficulties and the sad event that was the cause of everything, it managed to remain a very heartwarming anime.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10.<br />
There is nothing much to say about the art: the characters and the background are both very good, and the colours are as warm and bright as the show; as expected, the three main girls are drawn in detail and they sure look beautiful and cute.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10.<br />
I never pay much attention to the background sound of an anime, and well, as a matter of fact that&#039;s what it should do, not to catch the attention but to just convey a certain atmosphere suitable to the moment without the audience even noticing it: it worked. Also, the opening was great for me and I listened to it in its entirety every time.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8/10.<br />
Segawa Yuuto is the other strong point of the anime. Sure his decision was sudden and not very well pondered, but it was definitely not just on a whim: he was just repaying and even honouring his sister for doing the same thing years before. Also, his behaviour was even impeccable when he had to face the harsh reality of growing three children while going to college: not once he faltered, not once he put himself before the girls&#039; well-being, and he worked as hard as possible to give them all that they needed to have the life they deserved.<br />
The girls too were not just adorable but seriously involved in helping back Yuuto not to kill himself in the effort of making everything right for the four of them (well, here I&#039;m clearly talking about Sora and Miu). I could have a couple of perplexities that are not real downsides: first, the love that Sora feels for Yuuto seemed to me a little gratuitous, as if it was just decided that there had to be some love tension somewhere in the anime (this did not stop me from shipping Yuuto x Sora for the whole series); second, Sora and Miu seemed to remember to feel pain for the loss of their parents only when Hina was reminding them about it (but again, everyone copes with loss in different ways, so it didn&#039;t bother me very much in the end).<br />
As for the secondary characters, there were somewhat funny stereotypes as the cool beauty and the lolicon, but they were not too annoyingly flat to be a burden to the anime: they actually had their moments of seriousness and honest help, so sure, ok, I guess I forgive their other excesses.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10.<br />
This was a very enjoyable experience for me: it didn&#039;t have the drama that such a premise could signify for an anime, but instead it focused on making you cheer up for this group of unlucky children and their new tutor. It was a formula that worked very well on me, although it could not maybe be the same for someone less prone to be influenced by kawaii characters and situations; anyway I think it&#039;s very likely that you will find yourself smiling throughout every episode, not only for their adorableness but also for their unforeseen strength.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10.<br />
Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai! is an effective combination of light moments that you could find in any close family and moments in which the issues coming from the reality of their situation hit the characters (mostly Yuuto), and in both occasions you see them always react in the same way: with a contagious smile. I cannot but recommend it, as it will sure give your day what you need, be it a laughter or a tear.
