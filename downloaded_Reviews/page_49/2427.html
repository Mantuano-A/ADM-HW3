    Sometimes I just really fucking love Japan. This time is that time. Welcome to Uma Musume, show about horse-girls. <br />
<br />
Ever since the masterpiece of sports anime, Keijo, ended, I have been eagerly waiting for another series that treasures the beauty of sportic anime ladies. This time they have animals ears, tails and are so goddamn happy all the time. It&#039;s great.<br />
<br />
The characters are the selling point of this anime. Special Week (yes, that&#039;s an actual name of the main character) is super positive and energetic. It&#039;s almost as if there is no reining day in her life.(heh, pun). Unless someone sexually abuses her legs. Make

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281571">
        sure to never go behind a horse girl or she might just kick you!<br />
<br />
Silence Suzuka on the other hand is perfectly sportic. She was born to run. Whenever she trots away I find myself sitting on the edge of my saddle in awe. Amazing. This is what Sports series should be like. Forget that seasonal &#039;Megalo Box&#039; and see what true sportsmanship is all about.<br />
<br />
These girls have a dream to be the fastest horse-girls in the universe (by universe I mean within this anime because this type of shit doesn&#039;t exist anywhere else). How do they achieve this then? By going to horse-girl school and eating food like a.... well like a horse, but also with the power of friendship (the polar opposite type of friendship than you see in my little pony, I swear). Pretty neat.<br />
<br />
Some say these characters should have been centaurs. Pfff. Centaurs are the worst mythical creatures ever invented. Why? Because they have 2 backs, but can&#039;t lie on either. Must be worse than hell. The best choice was clearly to make them human-horse hybrids. <br />
<br />
The animation is great, everyone looks sexy and the sounds match the series like tail matches a pony. Just truly a stable production (heh pun v.2.0). <br />
<br />
This series obviously won&#039;t work when watched seriously. The best way to enjoy this is to take all the silliness in it with open pastures. Gallop to your closest Crunhyroll and give it ago because this type of greatness should be witnessed by all.

    The first thing that comes into my mind when I hear the word &quot;horse girls&quot; are those forbidden videos that you probably encountered at some point when you were watching porn. That&#039;s right. I&#039;m talking about those ones. Just the idea of thinking about it makes me want to puke. Those videos changed my perspective of horses in a heartbeat. <br />
<br />
I found this anime yesterday when one of my friend added it into his/her&#039;s PTW list. The thumbnail of the anime looked enticing so I decided to click on it and it brought me to the information page. I first thought that this show was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325191">
        a show with fox girls. However, I was wrong. This show was a show with horse girls. Horse. Girls. That first word.. It makes me want to puke. The past experiences I&#039;ve had with horses in Pornhub and XVIDEOS.. They&#039;re terrible. They&#039;re terrible! But I decided to start this anime anyways because they looked like a fox. <br />
<br />
The story of Uma Musume is pretty simple. Horse girls racing. They win. They lose. Repeat. That&#039;s the plot of the story. We&#039;re simply just seeing cute horse girls racing each other. However, the simplicity is the gem of this show. It&#039;s not too edgy. There&#039;s nearly. Actually. No fan service at all. It&#039;s just pure entertainment and joy. This show is the ideal show for whoever&#039;s bored and doesn&#039;t really know which know they should watch. <br />
<br />
P.A. Works&#039; art and quality still stands tall and strong. Powering the enjoyment of the show to the utmost. Though I have a small hope that it could&#039;ve been better if they made the effects when running better. P.A. Works never fail with their art style and quality. Maintaining their status as one of the best anime producers out there. I approve! <br />
<br />
There&#039;s really nothing much for me to say about the sounds except from the fitting background musics that perfectly fits the scenarios. They&#039;re really good. I even cried. More than once. Not lying. Aside from the background musics. Everything else is pretty much already perfect and balanced so I have no negative comments. <br />
<br />
This also applies to the characters. They are likable and I especially like Silence Suzuka because she looks &quot;the most&quot; like a fox. Aside from my preference. The character developments are awesome and realistic. Losing is the key to success, and through hardwork, one becomes stronger. This anime also changed my perspective on horses. The memories of those terrible experiences had been completely cleansed by the pure kawaii horse girls of this anime. Ah, I have been enlightened. <br />
<br />
I really enjoyed this anime. It was relaxing to watch. Well. To a certain extent and it also calmed down my depressing emotions from a previous anime I&#039;ve watched in which gave me depression. I am all happy again thanks to this anime! <br />
<br />
Anime really is amazing. Anything can become possible so long as it&#039;s anime. Cliche! But that&#039;s the point, isn&#039;t it? Heh. Anyways. If you want to see something that is relaxing and intense at times and is guaranteed that it won&#039;t give you depression. If you want to see kawaii girls running. If you want a little motivation. Then this anime is exactly just for you. <br />

    Each season PA Works delivers an enjoyable series, this time Uma Musume: Pretty Derby. The anime deepen values such us the need to improve no matter the adversity and the friendship. It is great seeing they did not resort to the fanservice or the boring and the repetitive plot ideas of the average sports series. The simple story carries a diverse set of characters and exploits their various personalities. Furthermore, the idea of moving forward keep us the viewer entertain until the end of the series.<br />
<br />
The main story is about horse-girls and their struggle to be the best. They suffer, cry, smile, joke, they are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281564">
        rivals, and are good friends. The story follows Special Week and her dream. In the beginning, we can feel her character a bit generic. As the story progresses, her role increases the complexity showing her emotions and fitting the story development. Special Week is the center of the story. However, the other horse girls aren’t left behind, and all the characters advance with the story and develop their personalities. For example, Silence Suzuka, her reasons for competing, and her values.  The story pacing is excellent. For a sports anime, they do not prolong the tracks in an annoying loop. The direction focuses on both aspects, the sport and the slice of life of this horse girls. It is pleasing how these girls keep fighting to improve and to be the best but in a very healthy way and not the annoying, pedant rivalry from other series. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, the horse-girls names came from real horses. Perhaps, some of the details in the story are from real events, but those do not spoil the plot. Furthermore, the story has comical events executed are a perfect time and are used to boost the interest in the characters. The anime tried to mix the horse-girl idea with the idols. I am not entirely sure if they succeeded, but the idea is not intrusive with the whole story and adds some dynamism at the end of each race.<br />
<br />
Another remarkable aspect from this series are the characters. For me, they are the most enjoyable part of the story. They do not need the fanservice or the idolizing theme to gather the viewer&#039;s attention. The plot helped the characters to evolve and to show their values, rivalry with some comical events each episode. <br />
<br />
Finally, I consider Uma Pretty Derby an acceptable series that could bring some entertainment that some viewers will find enjoyable and funny. You should give this series a try and maybe support the video game in the nearby future when released.

    Uma Musume 10/10<br />
<br />
Did you say horse girls? YEAAAAAAAH ... this is what we have.<br />
This wonder became one of the most exciting animes of the April 2018 season, when I watched it, due to its very well run races having all the excitement of the audience and remarkable moments that surprise. With each race we are in expectation of what could happen, if there would be an accident or who would win, nothing in them is predictable. Despite the rivalries between the teams the girls are super friends and together they are motivated in order to continue their careers. When I saw that P.A.Works was going

        to adapt the anime, I was excited. The character design is captivating and the color palette quite excellent. The dynamics of the storyline are consistent thanks to the races. The anime is clearly aimed at those who want to watch a more traveled and comedic storyline with lots of waifus for all sides! at the time I was anxious because there were rumors that the game would finally come to life. But that would only happen after a few episodes of Season 2, in 2021 ... and that will be for the Reviewn of Season 2. Well ... finally, I highly recommend this wonder. You can watch without mercy hahahahahaha.

    Uma Musume tells a story of horse girl idols, attending horse girls&#039; school, participating in races and giving concerts afterwards. Just how abstract does this concept sound? As weird as it might seem, Uma Musume is an outstanding show that exceeded my expectations.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with characters, which to me play the most important role in this case. All the horse girls are based on real race horses and their designs are all connected to their real life equivalents. I love the character designs - they are all so detailed and the connection to the actual horses makes them even more interesting. All girls are unique,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281583">
        both physically and in terms of personality. And I love them all. With a cast this broad, it&#039;s amazing that all characters stand out in one way or another, and I think everyone watching this show will find a horse girl they&#039;ll love. Honestly though, at first it was hard for me to choose a favourite. But among all the lovely ladies, I think it&#039;s the elegant Suzuka that I love the most.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s also worth noting that the characters have the names of the actual horses, and these can be a bit quirky, yet - in my opinion - really cool.<br />
<br />
Now onto the races. They are also based on the races that actually took place, and their outcomes are also inspired by how it was in real life - now this is a unique kind of fanservice! My advice is to read a bit about the horses and their stories. You might spoil yourself a bit, but it makes watching this anime all the more interesting, since you know what is about to happen. And it increases the emotional impact. Not everything goes like it was in real world, though - and I&#039;m especially happy about one thing that got changed. So happy that it made me burst into tears. <br />
The races are exciting and well done, I enjoyed watching them, and the fact that I actually care about the characters made watching them race even more enjoyable for me, since I was cheering for my favourites.<br />
<br />
Aside from racing, we see how the characters train, get stronger mentally and physically, develop friendships, face their fears and make their dreams come true. And as much as I get bored of regular slice of life, I enjoyed such kind of scenes in this anime. The comedy scenes are actually funny, there are some unique gags in Uma Musume which get repeated throughout the series but don&#039;t get old or unfunny. Uma Musume made me laugh many times. About as many times as it made me cry. I didn&#039;t expect a show about horse girl idols to make me this emotional, but Uma Musume did have an impact on me. It was funny, it was sad, and it was heartwarming.<br />
<br />
As I said before, our horse girls shine not only on the track, but on the stage as well! The songs are nice and catchy. And if you like them, I recommend checking more of the characters&#039; songs, not only these that were included in the anime. Still my personal favourite is Silent Star, which we get to hear at the end of one of the episodes.<br />
Uma Musume both sounds and looks good. As I said, I love the detailed and diverse character designs, and the artstyle and animation are of good quality too.<br />
<br />
To wrap it up, Uma Musume turned out to be a great surprise for me and I enjoyed it in every aspect. I highly recommend it, no matter if it&#039;s the slice of life, the races, the horse girls or the comedy that you&#039;re looking for. I hope you will love my horse girls as well!

    This show is what I can only describe as a pleasant surprise. The premise sounds really weird but I encourage you not to be put off by the fact that they are horses, especially when characters like cat girls are common place now in a lot of modern anime.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The plot is simple, it follows a bubbly young protagonist called Special Week on her quest to become the best horse girl she can be. Its pretty straight forward but there&#039;s some twists thrown in there to keep you watching.<br />
<br />
History:<br />
Believe it or not Special Week is actual a real horse and the show does a great job

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396173">
        at recreating their races into a sports anime. If you are fan of the real life races, you will surely be appreciated of the level of detail they put into making the environments match real life. To further this point, even background characters have unique designs based off their real life horses and they also follow the story lines of their real life counterparts. This really shows that the people who made this show have a passion for horse racing.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
I don&#039;t think I disliked a single character here. All of them were uniquely designed (especially their outfits which are amazing) and had their own traits, even if most of them didn&#039;t go through much development, they were still fun to watch and had funny interactions.<br />
<br />
Additionally, I especially liked the main character. At first, she seems like the basically go lucky young teenage girl protagonist but as the show goes on you start to realize she has her own problems that she&#039;s hiding away. I also loved her relationship with the other lead Suzuka, the interactions between them were so nice to watch and they had lots of chemistry together.<br />
<br />
My only complaint would be that since it&#039;s based off a gacha game, a lot of characters are introduced at once and it can be a bit of an overload at the start.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
I love the music in this show. The opening and ending especially I keep going back to listen to, it&#039;s so catchy. Background music also always felt like it fitted. <br />
<br />
Sports:<br />
I&#039;ve never been a fan of sports anime but the races in this show managed to not bore me due to their fast pace. I really thought the outcomes would be predictable but unless you have knowledge beforehand, its really hard to know who the victor will be and at some points I genuinely had no idea how the episode would end.<br />
<br />
Fan service:<br />
If you are looking for this, this is not the show for you.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: <br />
While this might not be the most profound thing you will ever watch I highly recommend giving it a try. You are likely to love at least one of the characters in this colorful cast and you can enjoy the mostly wholesome, sometimes somber atmosphere.

    I see no one has done a review, and I&#039;ve never actually done one, but I wanted to take the opportunity to let you know what you&#039;re getting into if you are looking at the cover art and title and wondering...<br />
<br />
Horse Girls: Obviously, from the cover art and title.<br />
<br />
Fan Service: Not really. Through 4 episodes this show has taken the high road and chosen to avoid too many opportunities to pander to that demographic. So for those hoping to see Horse Girls in often compromising situations, I feel this show will disappoint you. Episode 1 is your one fleeting glimpse of anything approaching it. <br />
<br />
Idols:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278162">
        Unfortunately, and it feels tacked on, as an afterthought. Fortunately they don&#039;t focus too much on it, but I wish they would have used the time they do devote to it to develop the characters or plot further instead. Without the Idol bit, I feel this show could have pushed into an 8 by seasons end.<br />
<br />
Comedy: I am enjoying how they are treating horse girls as a concept. It&#039;s made for some mildly humorous events between certain characters and situations. There is more comedy hidden in the antics of certain horse girls, but only those who recognize who they are (see below) will probably get it. They even managed to make the Idol portion of the show somewhat humorous. None of which I think will make you laugh in any audible sense, but you might smile or get a little warm feeling in that part of your brain that tells you something was funny in a cute way. <br />
<br />
Drama: Maaaaaybe we might see some later. See below. For now the show seems pretty laid back and campy.<br />
<br />
Sports: This seems to be the bread and butter of the show, so if you like sports anime you&#039;ll probably find plenty to like in this show. So far the races have been entertaining to me, and realizing their historical significance has increased my enjoyment of them and the plot as a whole. The girls seem to be friendly rivals, but there seems to be more of a competitive rivalry developing where the horse trainers are concerned.<br />
<br />
Speaking of historical significance, all the girls in the show are named after real horses. If you don&#039;t want to spoil yourself, then don&#039;t bother looking them up, but if you&#039;re like me (who isn&#039;t too bothered by spoilers) and wanted to know if they were real names and more about them, you might wind up getting more enjoyment out of the show by educating yourself about the horses and their racing heritage, and that enjoyment includes some of the antics some of the girls have displayed so far.<br />
<br />
So that&#039;s it in a nutshell. I&#039;ve been enjoying the show. The girls are cute (cute character designs in general), the story is interesting to me. The art and sound seems good to me, but in fairness I&#039;m not the kind of guy who runs around critiquing things that closely. So far this has been a pretty good Cute Girls style show that happens to be more of a sports anime...that happens to have Idols. I&#039;m giving it a high 6, so we&#039;ll round it up to 7/10.<br />

    I saw this anime back in spring, but didn&#039;t have anything to watch it on. Once i found it on VRV i remembered that i wanted to watch this so i gave it a watch and holy crap i freaking love this anime. Everything about it is very lovably.<br />
<br />
First the Story. The story follows Special Week, a horse girl wanting to be the best horse girl racer in Japan. Along the way she meets other horse girls like Silence Suzuki who Special Week looks up to and following Team Spica as they all race towards there goals. The story was very nice and easy to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300707">
        follow. It also motivates you to want to do something like them. Weather that be running or just working on something you really want to. <br />
<br />
Next the art. The art style of this anime is very unique and colorful. This anime could of had blan colors, but it chose colors that would pop to the viewer and want to keep an eye on because with most anime today having the same art style it is very nice to see this anime not follow the norm and create visually stunning scenes for the entire anime. <br />
<br />
Next the sound. The sound was spot on with every movement either the characters made or what the area around them does. What i really liked was when any of the girls were running or multiply were running at a time it made it sound like an actually horse was running, but then remembering it was horse girl running made it even more enjoyable because they paid attention to details and made sure everything was correct.<br />
<br />
Next the characters. The characters for any anime are the make or break for a series. For this anime every single characters was lovably and enjoyable to watch. Even the background characters had some personality to them which i dont see in anime that much. For this show to give a personality to all the characters you see on screen is a warm welcome for me.<br />
<br />
Finally the enjoyment of the anime. I loved this anime all the way from the beginning to the end. This is one of those shows where you say i want a second season so badly. I laughed when scenes were actually funny, i was worried and excited for the characters during there races, the encouragement each of the characters give each other is very sweet and makes me feel like one of them sometimes. Overall the enjoyment for this anime is through the roof. I will say that this anime is suppose to be taken in a fun way. You want to have fun with it and go in trying to find something sad. <br />
<br />
Overall this is one of the best anime i have watched in some time. If this got a second season i would be all over it just because of how much i enjoyed it. Hopefully i get to see more of them because it was so much fun watching this and always having a smile to my face.

    Ah, another anime about your everyday generic high school girl following her dreams to the &quot;route&quot; of  succeeding and achieving her goal which ends up becoming a bunch of fan service and having no meaning to the plot at all?  - Wrong.<br />
<br />
Let me get this straight, at first glance you would assume this right? However allow me to tell you now. Stop convincing yourself this is one of those crappy fan service anime based on the appearance of this show creating negative connotations for yourself.<br />
<br />
<br />
It starts off Special Week and of course one of the main protagonists in this series and is inspired

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280083">
        by winning her races and becoming the best horse girl in Japan, simple right?<br />
Next, we move onto Silence Suzuka a horse girl determined to encourage and give hope to other horse girls which is conveyed through her running.<br />
Then after we are followed by the characters in Team Spica and Team Rigil yet, as simple as these characters may be each way they are designed and how they act really give off this vibe of the horse girls true personalities.<br />
<br />
In addition, Uma Musume also adds a portion of comedy to make sure you have a laugh or a chuckle or that warm smile on your face from time to time.<br />
Though this being a sports anime it really gives the excitement needed for every single race no matter who is participating. Along with the concept of horse girls and idols, it gives an interesting aspect of sports anime which I never thought of. For Special Week being the main protagonist, you would expect for her to win all her races? But this was not the case. The series shows how hard work is needed to get what you want, it shows that nothing out there is free, you work for it, so aiming to be the best horse girl in Japan needs tenacity to make it happen, and not only is it just Special Week that shows this but so does the rest of the horse girls. <br />
<br />
It allows a lot of character development for everyone, and that they understand the feeling of loosing and what it’s like to rise to the top again allowing us to see different views of their identity and what makes them unique.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I honestly have enjoyed Uma Musume and would recommended to watch this, if you can get past all the prejudice and derogatory towards it, and if you like sports anime with some comedy.  I love watching each of the characters grow and the excitement and heart pounding when racing each other leaving me with this bittersweet emotion each episode.  <br />

    There are some anime that should not be as good as they were: Uma Musume is a golden example of that instance. Uma Musume is an anime derived from a mobile game about Horse Girls racing. If you happen to beat your opponents, you get to set up and start fulfilling your dream of becoming an idol. <br />
<br />
If someone were to tell me that premise, half of me would think that it would sell extremely well and the other half would believe that person is out of their mind. Yet, this anime works so well.<br />
<br />
The foundation of this anime is in its great storytelling about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311762">
        a girl by the name of Special Week going from, essentially, inferiority to idealism. The story is by no means original, but that doesn&#039;t matter when it is executed as well as it is. There is plenty of foreshadowed plot points that are complemented by quick resolutions, which keeps the pacing of this series upbeat. The storytelling of this anime is very textbook, and I think its through that rigidity that viewers get offered a substantive story, instead of an anime studio taking the low-ground with CGDCT fluff.<br />
<br />
The art design and sound of Uma Musume doesn&#039;t really give much to be desired. The biggest problem that I can see people having is that the CGI racing girls don&#039;t really blend well into the colored backgrounds. Having that drastic switch between digital art into CGI is not really a harsh criticism, but it can be a little jarring to see clean digitial art movement that gets quickly shifted into CGI. I think that could have been cleaned up a bit more.<br />
<br />
However, I don&#039;t think anyone can talk about this series without talking about how cute the girls are and how their outfits are fantastic to look at. I sincerely hope the costume designers had fun creating those outfits. The racing outfits were all the same, but when it came to individual stuff, I think it was really good looking.<br />
<br />
Uma Musume is one of those once in a few years anime that was made to break expectations. It is by no means the best anime of its season. However, to call it less than a top 10 anime for that year, I think would be a great disservice to how well executed it was. Please give this series a watch. I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll regret it.

    A fiery horse (girl) with the speed of light, a cloud of dust and a hearty HIYO SILVER!!!!Now that this anime has been competed , I can say for sure that it was good, since it isn&#039;t always that the cast who portrays around here were a bunch of horse girls, who were competing to be on top in some overly rated track and field, now that polt maybe the usual main character who enters such competition to make it to the top, It now alway something new was added in what can be say as the usual girls with cat ears, dog ears and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281653">
        the most common  rabbit ears and now we have horse ears with matching horse tail. On the Character category, so ok them horse girl were name after famous real life racehorses in Japan, but let&#039;s not focus on that, rather let&#039;s focus on them horse girls&#039; relationship were  we can&#039;t deny that there was this shoujo-ai involve but was hidden in some way like the relationship of Special Week and Silence Suzuka in a form that SpeChan want to race her, Gold Ship and Mejor McQueen in a form of GolShi&#039;s Bullying on McQueen that often backfires  Scarlet Daiwa and Tokai Teo whose relationship can be compared to that of two bitches duking out and liking it as well well, either way it was funny and touching as well especially when we talk about the background on them as real horse in real life were it pretty much match up if you&#039;ll look on the details of those real horses  . Now on the Art category of this anime there was the usual knee high socks and every horse girls were sporting it, so cosplayer will have something to go for it but when it comes to them horse girls racing attire, I sure them cosplayers would have a lot to choose from . When it come to this anime&#039;s enjoyable it was quite intense on the last episode when we see all them racing for the Japan Cup only to not know who won since studio P.A Works is saving this for the game that Cygames wants to produce via Android or IOS...so my verdict:<br />
<br />
Story-Good 7: Since we get to see something usual but diffrent when we talk about something that was related to the real horses  of Japan.<br />
<br />
Art-Fair 6: I&#039;m sure them cosplayers are gonna have a heck of a time when choosing an outfit of them horse girls in thier racing outfit, plus the knee high socks were all over the place. Btw no panty, no bikini services around here and none of that big bouncing melons around...too bad no joystick playing around. <br />
<br />
Sound-Fair 6: Nice opening theme and the song in the last ep. and that&#039;s that.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- Very Good 8: feels like you&#039;re in areal race.<br />
<br />
Overall- Very Good 8: I need not say more. <br />
<br />

    *This review contains spoilers.<br />
<br />
As a PA Works fan, this was extremely disappointing. Don&#039;t get me wrong, either. I wanted to enjoy this, very desperately you could even say. <br />
<br />
It is, to my understanding, that this was merely an advertisement for the game based on the same name. There is horse racing, and there is idols. From a Japanese market perspective, this makes sense considering idols are a popular genre. The combination of the two ideas seems creative enough to make a decent and successful show. Rather than horse racing and idol dancing/singing being on the same level, the idol aspect is secondary to the story.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281755">
        Although, in the second half of the show, it is entirely irrelevant. This makes it come off as a cheap tactic to get more money, and it most likely is. This would not be such a huge issue if the racing element of it wasn&#039;t so mediocre. <br />
<br />
The entire plot revolves around racer girls getting random power ups for no explainable reason in order to &quot;overcome&quot; their obstacles and achieve their dreams. Not only is that unrealistic in the manner it was shown, but it is blatantly lazy writing. There was one episode where the show seemed to incorporate some actual strategy, such as when Special Week learned to change her running technique in order to get up a hill and defeat an opponent. This is the moment where the show&#039;s potential could have thrived and portrayed our main heroine as a crafty, adaptable, and relentless person. Then it completely disregards that and never uses it again. Additionally, there was a long running comedy shtick of Spe eating white rice - if I recall the food correctly - yet no one seemed to stop her or inform her it would only make her fat? There could have been an entire episode dedicated to the struggle of formulating and maintaining a proper athlete diet, showing us exactly how hard it is to be in top shape and something we could all relate to. But the potential for a well-thought-out approach to an intensive sport was squandered yet again. My frustration only continues from here.<br />
<br />
We are introduced to Special Week as our main horse girl. However, my problem with her is that she is too plain. Too boring. She even looks boring, taking on the appearance of a side character as her fellow peers have more flashy appearances. This isn&#039;t so much a critique, but it&#039;s merely an observation I noticed. I can easily see how her backstory ties in nicely to her look, but my preference would have been something more distinctive. My hope at the start of the anime was that they would build on her character eventually, which they did to a certain degree with her outsider backstory and all. The girl from the countryside narrative sure did a decent job at making it seem like she would come out of no where and flip the entire racing industry on its head, changing it forever. Soon after, it quickly falls apart as she is seemingly unimportant, loses a lot, and whose entire growth only comes from a friendly rivalry with a cliche promise. Don&#039;t even get me started on the side characters. They were equally as boring and unimportant aside from maybe two or three. They all literally say the most cliche things. Honestly, who wrote this script? And who keeps writing in that comedy routine of two side characters constantly fighting each other because they&#039;re &quot;close&quot; or whatever? That was done to death, especially by the last episode. It&#039;s a common writing tactic, which is used to compensate for weak character writing, to portray them as &quot;likable&quot; and &quot;relatable,&quot; but it did the opposite effect and only made me hate those two more. This is further proven to be the case considering I don&#039;t even remember their names, which I couldn&#039;t care less at this point, in such an overwhelmingly huge cast. The continuous addition of supporting roles dilutes their overall impact in an already scarcely fleshed out tale.<br />
<br />
While most of these girls had underwhelming personalities, you would think the art and animation would be the strongest part to the show. Well, we were wrong. The art style is painfully generic and emulates a wannabe A1-Pictures idol show but can&#039;t seem to get there just yet. This is PA Works we are talking about. We know exactly what PA Works is capable of when it comes to its world building and creation of beautiful backgrounds. My immediate first impression of the show was, &quot;This is not PA Works.&quot; And rightfully so, because this leaves a stain on their track record. &quot;But maluhia, you can&#039;t go comparing other shows to this one.&quot; Well, I can, I did, and I have a good reason for this. PA Works is a very niche studio in the anime industry, just as much as Kyoto Animation is. If Kyoto Animation&#039;s quality dropped drastically, everyone would be quick to point out the differences. This is the case as well, and it should be a valid critique in the face of mediocrity. You are called Progressive Animation Works for a reason, so why do you bring irony to your name with subpar work? To make matters worse, much of the running scenes in Pretty Derby include recycled backdrops with the bottom portion of their bodies often being cut out altogether. For a running-sport anime, it&#039;s kind of hard to be that without the actual dynamics of running. The dullness of it all only intensifies when the &quot;climax&quot; episodes look like any other predictable race it had previously shown us. There was nothing satisfying about it, yet it tricks you into thinking investing time into it would pay off by the end. To pour salt on the wound, the last race has every other girl being able to keep up with Silence Suzuka, which contradicts Suzuka&#039;s entire buildup of character and every event before as if it never happened. Not only was the conclusion pulled out of thin air, but it insults your intelligence.<br />
<br />
To wrap it up, the music component was just &quot;okay.&quot; If I&#039;m being honest, there&#039;s not much to say, and you couldn&#039;t really argue otherwise considering the idol portion of the show was unimportant to the story as a whole. The ED did include a small scene of Special Week coming first place in a race, beating out her rival whom came in second, and the rest of their team took the remaining positions. It is possible that this was the end result of the finale race as it was heavily implied by their coach over and over. I guess you would have to play the game if you&#039;re interested in more? Not that I would. As for the trainer&#039;s romance, it unexpectedly appeared then ceased to exist, much like my hopes for PA Work&#039;s latest effort. To summarize Uma Musume: Pretty Derby (TV) in one word, it would be lazy.<br />
<br />
Final rating: 2/10.

    This animation is part of a larger project from Cygames which also includes comics, upcoming mobile game and of course merchandise. Knowing that, one could think of this anime as a longer advertisement for the game and not expect much. That&#039;s what I thought at first, but it turned out to be a really enjoyable show.<br />
<br />
In japanese animation, there are lots of combinations of female characters with animal traits. Wolf girls, monster girls and probably most popular cat girls. Uma Musume Pretty Derby is a show about horse girls. But not just random girls with horse ears and tails. They are named after real-life famous

          <span style="display: none;" id="review283890">
        race horses. The story is also based on actual races. After watching Uma Musume, you may not only be interested in playing the mobile game from Cygames, but also want to know more about horse racing.<br />
<br />
Big part of the Uma Musume project is that the characters are also performing on stage like idols. Some people may think that it&#039;s trying to appeal to broader audience, but personally I think it&#039;s really interesting combination and works rather well in a world of horse girls, where they are already racing idols.<br />
<br />
Story 9/10<br />
It could be an advertisement, boring race sequences and the same introductions repeated for different girls in every episode. Instead, what we got is a great show about joy and sorrow, friendship and rivalry, defeat and victory.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10<br />
Animation is just great. Races are dynamic and detailed character design really sets apart different girls. There are a few moments of 3D animation but the models and movements are really similar to 2D, which is nice.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10<br />
We can hear only a couple of original songs from the game. In the future Cygames will probably release more. Sound effects during racing sequences work nicely and sound similar to actual horses running.<br />
<br />
Character 9/10<br />
Every horse girl has unique traits. They have their own uniquely designed outfit for races. During the 13 episodes we can also witness development for main characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10<br />
Some cliches are inevitable, horse girls may not sound promising to everyone, but I highly recommend watching Uma Musume Pretty Derby if you are looking for something light to watch. My score may be a bit high, maybe because of lowered expectations, but I have seen much worse shows that did not try to sell me something.

    Back when the Spring season originally started, Uma Musume was memed in the anime club I&#039;m at as being “just another beast show” and one that would fizzle out of popularity and quality very soon, I tried the first episode anyway expecting a train wreck, what did I get in return? One of the most fun shows I&#039;ve ever seen. Period. There&#039;s a lot of reasons as to why this show is just so fantastic and I have noted down most of them in this review of a show that defied all odds, all expectations and gave us one hell of an epic anime.<br />
<br />
First off,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281718">
        one thing the show was excellent in doing was the way it accurately portrayed the original history behind the horse girls. To those of you who are unfamiliar, the names of the horses aren&#039;t made up, these are real life Japanese horses who raced in the &#039;90s and have been anime-ified as being horse girls while maintaining a 95% historical accuracy rate. Why 95%? It&#039;s because one of the horses had a dark backstory which was toned down in the anime, although you&#039;ll see it, it won&#039;t be as dark as the harsh reality was which is pretty much understandable because Uma Musume isn&#039;t such a show in the first place. Nevertheless, apart from that, from start to finish, Uma Musume maintained a healthy accuracy rate (in fact, it&#039;s 100% in terms of who won and lost the race) throughout its entire run. Pun intended. <br />
<br />
Despite its accuracy, most of the people who watched the show may obviously not have knowledge of the original Japanese horses and their races, so this helps to bring suspense to the table, but this is not all. Uma Musume knows a lot of things, and it knows damn well how to control the element of surprise as well as the suspense it brings with it. What am I talking about? You can never predict who&#039;ll win in the race, not even when the race is going on. You might think this is easy but if you look at most sports anime they don&#039;t have as much suspense or any suspense at all because they always show the main characters as Shounen as possible who will work hard and defeat the opponents no matter how difficult they are to beat. <br />
<br />
What Uma Musume makes us realise (that most other sports anime don&#039;t) is that hard work and teamwork alone won&#039;t give you the win you think you deserved. It shows us the harsh life lesson that hard work doesn&#039;t always get rewarded and you won&#039;t always win, and this is shown by making the protagonists lose at times. “Is that all? There are a few anime that show the team of character lose” you might say. As with most things in life, losing isn&#039;t the end of the story. It&#039;s what comes after that. The lessons you learn from it, Uma Musume knows and shows just that, such as by characters coping with their loss, starting to work even harder, not be too overconfident and take proper measures and be grounded. Beware, if you expect this anime to be all wins and celebrations 24/7 you&#039;re in for a surprise. This seemingly kiddish show (I really feel sorry for those who think that) has a lot of lessons to teach, like friendship. In particular we got to see the friendship of Special Week and Silence Suzuka build up. At first Suzuka was admired by the rookie Special Week but after becoming roommates it all changed. For the better. Making new friends, interacting with your friends, having fun, this is all the joy of friendship and we saw all of this excellently shown by Progressive Animation Works (or P.A works to you acronym fans). <br />
<br />
On the other side of the spectrum friendship also brings with itself, rivalry. And this was also evident although not as much. We saw Special Week and Silence Suzuka cheer each other on along with challenge each other from time to time. This is very important to show since most friendships have these (to those of you without friends, please find some and discover the joy of friendship and rivalry) and this ends up as yet another plus point for the show, rivalry isn&#039;t always hating each other, it can also mean friends battling each other for who comes out on top and having a nice laugh about it later. That&#039;s friendship. That&#039;s rivalry. No. That&#039;s friendly rivalry. Or wait. That is the true spirit of friendship itself isn&#039;t it? Apart from having someone to challenge we also have the hardships. What happened to one of the two was horrifying and though it wasn&#039;t as dark as the reality was it still left a crushing impact on most of the viewers and many were devastated (or at least the characters in the anime were). That&#039;s where the hardship struck. The friend rushed in tears to save her best friend and neither could function properly since they were so worried about each other. This is what hardships in friendship can be sometimes. And we should support our nakama and try our hardest to overcome the obstacles that lie ahead. <br />
<br />
Coming back to the previous point of suspense, we got suspense because we saw our favourite characters lose. When we see someone not maintain a 100% win rate, we start to get tense when we see their next race because there&#039;s a possibility that they might lose, and this is evident in every real life sport (and a few anime). No team will lose forever, no one will win forever, both will happen to everyone albeit in different ratios. And another important thing is that victory isn&#039;t always achieved with working alone, or to be more accurate, it mostly doesn&#039;t work. Victory is gained through teamwork, and no, not the Shounen type. Teamwork is helping your friends do better, share your ideas, cheer each other on, encourage friendly rivalries. These are all what makes us achieve victory, and although we can&#039;t always win we still learn important lessons and realise that we had fun working with our friends. And this spirit is what people should follow. <br />
<br />
Uma Musume didn&#039;t show us everyone working alone, despite being an anime about racing, a primarily single-person sport, it showed us how all the girls helped each other gain the edge and have fun racing. This is what Special Week embodies, this is what sports should embody. Sports is fun and when it stops being fun, you quickly drop out and this is what was evident with Silence Suzuka. She couldn&#039;t find racing fun and Special Week taught how to have fun while racing. <br />
<br />
On the topic of racing we cover the artstyle as well. P.A Works knocked the ball out of the park with this one (been a long time since I made a sports pun). The bright colourful palette cheered me up and the animation during the races was much like the rest of the plot, serious yet cheerful. Uma Musume might show it&#039;s characters being playful and lazy at times as with every sports person outside the field but when you step into the field finally, it&#039;s a battle. And P.A Works knew it, which is why the races themselves are taken very seriously. You don&#039;t see hilarious stuff happening while the race is going on. You see the characters fixated on that finish line and have to keep moving forward, which is pretty reminiscent of P.A Works’ name itself, to move forward. Think of it like a two sided dish. One has the playful nature of friends meeting each other and messing about and the second, which has everyone become serious because of the situation and obstacles ahead. If it wasn&#039;t obvious, the artstyle even while they&#039;re racing takes a serious yet excellently designed turn. <br />
<br />
And speaking of the races themselves, I&#039;ve never enjoyed watching a race where people run. Car races and the like are fun but P.A Works made running enjoyable, which is also a huge plus point to the show. Despite it&#039;s unique aspect and nature of the show (horse girls based on real horses racing), Uma Musume does a fine job of making it&#039;s premise easy to understand, heck it&#039;s TOO easy to understand. Just run as fast as you can while making sure you don&#039;t waste stamina. Train too hard and you lose, train too less and you&#039;re unprepared. Finding the balance is what&#039;s necessary. And this concept may feel simple because it is simple, it&#039;s surprising how many anime haven&#039;t done this as easily. To cover another good point and to make another pun about the anime’s plus points, we have the pacing (:P). Surprisingly, it&#039;s not fast paced. The pacing is done such that it&#039;s easy to understand what&#039;s happening without having to go back and on the other hand it doesn&#039;t drag on. We saw a race in most episodes and it was a breeze to smooth over them without issues. <br />
<br />
A large cast left me concerned since I thought not everyone would get development and unfortunately this was what I found as a problem in the anime. The show was too focused on Special Week and Silence Suzuka to focus on even the other Spica horses, let alone Rigil. I felt we could have seen much more if this show was a 24 episode series since that could mean we&#039;d see development for them as well. Another problem I felt was that at times Uma Musume felt repetitive. This was in the earlier stages of the anime, namely it&#039;s first 4 episodes before it went with one proper varied formula and stuck to it. As a final point, yet another positive one, the show had a fantastic soundtrack. Apart from the catchy OP and ED, the BGM (or background music to those who don&#039;t know) hyped me up and oh the music that played when the races were on, especially the way the tone of the music went even higher in the last corner of the race. It left chills on my spine. Never been so hyped for such a show before. <br />
<br />
So overall, Uma Musume is a show that started off a bit slow, but it later (after the third episode in fact) steps up and excellently continues it&#039;s run to the finish. It teaches us lessons about friendship, hardship, rivalry, loss, teamwork and whatnot, and still manages to hype over it&#039;s viewers with it&#039;s brilliantly done racing segments and soundtrack. If a bright cheery anime with important life lessons is your type of anime to watch, then Uma Musume will be sure to leave you satisfied and wanting for more. Although the anime was mainly for marketing and engaging interest for the Uma Musume mobile game, the Anime’s quality itself far surpasses what people would expect, all thanks to P.A Works. <br />
<br />
The Spring season had a lot of interesting anime but only two came out on top for me. Hinamatsuri and Uma Musume. If this review gauged your interest in trying out the anime, please do so, for you are in for one heck of an awesome show at the Starting Gate!<br />
<br />
P.S: Without spoilers, that last episode has got to be one of the most legendary ones I&#039;ve ever seen. Why? It&#039;s one hell of a FANTASTIC send-off to a lovable series. It embodied everything that made the show great from it&#039;s previous episodes. The final race and the end credits made it feel like I was watching a big budget anime movie, and that&#039;s exactly how the artstyle was, but it was EVEN MORE EPIC in the last episode. Uma Musume is definitely a show I&#039;ll miss a lot.

    I first started watching it as a joke, but fuck, I think I fell in love with this anime. I never expected for an anime about a group of cute girls who sing and dance and do sports to be this good?? Not to mention it&#039;s just a promotional anime for a mobile game.<br />
<br />
First of all, it&#039;s such a bizarre concept but it just works. They go all the way with its weirdness and embrace it. The amount of references and easter eggs related to real life racehorses is incredible and just shows how much dedicated and truly passionate the team behind this project is.<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281741">
        animation is vibrant and fun, each character manages to have a unique and interesting design, and that&#039;s incredible considering there are like 60 horse girl characters in total.<br />
<br />
Another aspect I like about it is that it isn&#039;t a fanservice anime at all, like what I first thought it would be. It&#039;s very lighthearted, and at its very core it&#039;s just a well portrayed sport anime with themes of friendship and accomplishing goals. I was worried about the whole idol part but it doesn&#039;t feel annoying at all, it&#039;s barely used in the anime and I believe the whole reason it&#039;s tacked on to begin with is just because it&#039;s gonna be a part of the game. If you&#039;re expecting Love Live but with horse girls then you&#039;re gonna be disappointed. <br />
<br />
Anyway,the experience of watching this is just pure joy and I loved every second

    Uma Musume, a story of a Horse-girl who wants to become the best Horse Girl in Japan. At first glance at Uma Musume, I don&#039;t really think it&#039;ll appeal that much, I was like &quot;It&#039;s all about just competitions right? Will this be another cliche one?&quot;, Fortunately I was wrong, the first episode did a great job introducing new characters and it&#039;s goal. You might think that this competition anime will just be a cliche but you&#039;re quite wrong, Uma Musume is trying it&#039;s best to be as unique as it can, If you want racing and girls all around your screen with proper plot,

    Well discovered this seeing a post in an anime group I&#039;m in, it was the opening when she arrived on the train the look of wonder on her face was magic, I don&#039;t wish to spoil anything but she has quite an interesting back story as well. It looked interesting, girl runners with the cute touch that they are horse girls. Binge watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it. This is the first sports themed anime I&#039;ve watched I could seriously find nothing to dislike about this anime, if you like comedy, drama watching someone attain their goals in fierce competition and defying the odds this

    - Finally my review of Uma Musume Pretty Derby, beginning with the story that is simply one of the most different stories I&#039;ve ever seen in an anime, at least in its theme; the story in general is nothing from another world, it is just different but at the same time it gives a very interesting message about friendship, and, moreover, Uma Musume has an excellent direction that without a doubt is one of the greatest positive aspects of the work; Finally, about the story does not have much to say, it is a different story but at the same time, simple, fun, interesting messages

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281746">
        and of course great to accompany.<br />
<br />
- On the technical side, A Pretty Derby Musume is simply the second best anime of the year so far in the technical part, only losing to Violet Evergarden; in short, the technical part of Uma Musume is simply stunning, it&#039;s all very colorful and well done, plus a great animation, that&#039;s quality P.A Works; there are some moments that come to be unbelievable so good that it is the technical part; now on the soundtrack, it could have been better, but it&#039;s still a great soundtrack, especially in some moments that the soundtrack was highlighted by giving more depth in some scenes.<br />
<br />
- Now talking about the characters, who are simply captivating and charismatic, especially the main protagonist, seriously, I loved the Special Week, no doubt my favorite character of that year so far, however leaving that aside, in fact the cast of Uma Musume is simply sensational, one more charismatic than the other, besides the excellent development of the protagonists; without doubt the cast of Uma Musume, is one of the greatest positive points of the work.<br />
<br />
- Conclusion, A Pretty Derby Musume may even have some minor problems here and there, but its qualities are much greater in my view; the anime features a different but interesting story, plus a dazzling technical part, an excellent cast of characters, and a first-rate direction; no doubt A Pretty Derby Musume is my favorite anime of the spring season 2018, and also my second favorite anime of the year so far, and without a shadow of doubt, I recommend to all this magnificent anime that is A Pretty Musume Derby !! 😍💜😉💛 !!

    If you like cute girls, but as horses, well not literally (the horse part), you will love this.<br />
The story has cute, funny, and emotional moments, you will enjoy this a lot. I teared at the sweetest moment some of which were not even sad. The animation of the race was actually amazing and obviously characters wear special outfits which I actually found interesting/amazed/cute.<br />
The story flows at a great pace where you will find it amazing, there are a lot of characters which I couldn&#039;t remember all of them, my favorite el condor pasa, and this anime off a mobile game apparently and real horses. Just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297983">
        enjoy the anime and have fun in the silly moments.

    Out of 100 Nobles watching...<br />
84 were impressed!<br />
6 were busy laughing at derpy 3d models<br />
5 aren&#039;t into idol stuff<br />
5 weren&#039;t too amused with the tropes<br />
<br />
Uma Musume really had no business being as good of a show as it was. It stands as a testament to the intrigue and life that can be given to a show when the protagonist of a story has no guarantee of victory.<br />
<br />
The show is set in an alternate universe where the spirits of famous race horses from our world are reincarnated into &quot;Horse Girls&quot; in this world. The horse girls have horsey ears and tails, but otherwise are regular human women.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282395">
        It&#039;s a pretty low tier monster girl for consumers of THAT genre, but the execution is done well and the fact that the girls don&#039;t have a dopey double set of ears like many monster girls from other media the show automatically gets a few Nobles attention for the immersion factor.<br />
<br />
The story follows a young horse girl from the countryside named Special Week making her trip to attend a prestigious school for training horse girls for races. She holds the dream of being the best horse girl in Japan and her pursuit of that dream directly colliding with the hopes and aspirations of the other characters in the show are where things get interesting. <br />
<br />
As mentioned earlier the show does well with its immersion. It has a well built world that the horse girls live in that makes horse girl racing and culture feel like a living breathing part of its canon. The show contains a massive cast of characters and every horse girl is based on a real-life racing horse with aspects of their personality, appearance, and clothing reflecting their origin. It&#039;s a nice touch and shows P.A. Works really cared about the product they were making.<br />
<br />
A short note on the OP and ED. They&#039;re both amazing and filled the &quot;Shiny Days&quot; and &quot;Ishukan Communication&quot; shaped holes in my heart left by Yuru Camp and Kobayashi&#039;s Maid Dragon.<br />
<br />
The biggest draw back to the show was that it was very obviously made on a budget. Panning still shots, recycled frames, and the implementation of mixed 3d/2d effects that strain the eye are the offenders here. For the most part the show makes very good use of editing and action lines to make the more &quot;animation light&quot; sequences still feel alive and natural. <br />
<br />
The use of CG models in a number of background crowd shots were annoying but even worse were models used during some of the actual horse racing scenes that presented an image of 3d characters float-walking on a 2d plane. This wasn&#039;t a huge problem though because despite some of the janky weird looking running animations there were lots of racing scenes that were gorgeous and conveyed a powerful sense of motion and speed that were a joy to watch and left me at the edge of my seat wondering who was going to win.<br />
<br />
To conclude, I don&#039;t like idol type anime or manga, but Uma Musume had so much more than just an idol show to offer and presented a moving narrative that at times had me shedding manly tears the same way Boku no Hero gets me. <br />
<br />
The aspirations and dreams of characters you love with only one allowed victory... who will win?<br />
