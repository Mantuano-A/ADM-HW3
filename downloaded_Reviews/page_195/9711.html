                       Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai “The Seven Mortal Sins”<br />
<br />
Backstory and Information:<br />
Hobby Japan has finally delivered and now this year Spring of 2017 with the help of TNK the studio behind “High School DxD” alongside with Artland. This series being far older than the now widely known Netflix’s Seven Deadly Sins, Hobby Japan responsible for series such as Queen’s Blade, Hyakka Ryouran “Samurai Girls” and Demon King Daimaou or “Ichiban Ushiro Daimaou, Whatever it is you have seen, Hobby Japan has a history with high tier Ecchi and

        who can forget their amazing figurines that radiate quality.<br />
<br />
Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai being a series that had over the years been teased to the fans on multiple instances as this series is from a Video Game, It has left us waiting many years because of dilemmas. Whether this series could be delivered in shorts or OVA’s it remained to be seen.  With a Manga introduction in August 29th of 2016, Published by Hobby Japan it brought forth light to the people who were getting tired of holding their breath and later confirmed when Visuals once again teased a incoming anime series. The issue grew deeper whether the anime would adapt the video game or the new fresh manga, Categorized “Shounen” and on February 2017 a “Seinen” version is being put out by “Media Factory”.<br />
<br />
Plot + Pros:<br />
“The prideful archangel Lucifer disobeys God and is cast into the lowest level of hell as a fallen angel. On her way to hell, Lucifer happens to meet a high school girl on Earth named Maria, who helps her. In hell, Lucifer meets Leviathan, and Leviathan explains to Lucifer about The Seven Deadly Sins, the seven demon king rulers of hell. After The Seven Deadly Sins seal Lucifer&#039;s powers, Lucifer goes on a journey with Maria and Leviathan to defeat them.” Courtesy of Anime News Network<br />
<br />
It seems pretty cut and dry, as one can guess the story here is one of revenge with juicy details native to Hobby Japan’s Ecchi ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). <br />
<br />
The Question now becomes what will the anime reflect, One of the two manga or the video game?. The answer is a little of all three and this series approaches the viewer with more visual appeal rather than complex storytelling as the series holds to present a simple point and questions the tittle of the sins and whether if any of the seven should be indeed be worthy of pulling a human soul towards Hell.<br />
<br />
Whilst the main character isn’t on full out display as of yet, due to we have a duo of Lucifer and the human Maria leading the show, This show is executing a learning process between human and Lucifer as they unravel sin by sin and accept that nature isn’t sinful as it make up each one of us. While showcasing high tier ecchi for the delight of many of us to see, It is well accompanied by doubt and self-discovery of each of the demon lords as they learn from their defeats that their existence isn’t anything to be ashamed about and shows us growth from a Lucifer who sees herself as one cast out for not belonging to the herd and being an individual thinker.<br />
<br />
As the series advances it pseudo - parodies &quot;Dante&#039;s Inferno&quot; in the Journey of Lucifer in place of Dante to recover her powers, Become head of the 7 Deadly sins and hold a goal of holding Heaven, God and the Archangel Michael accountable for kicking her out of heaven for simply having a opinion and most of all, for being individualistic.<br />
<br />
The Con:<br />
While the series is visually stunning here and there and has a lot going for it, It mirrors another series in one aspect. This series is leaning more towards an original work and like Dragon Ball Super there is a lot of improvisation and often things fit in on rather rushed ways, As the Manga both put out by Hobby Japan and Media Factory don’t have as much content for the series to draw from, So it often does fill in the blanks in a anime only format. <br />
<br />
Except for the whole Dante&#039;s Inferno references from here and there.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
This series has a rather somewhat unique animation and has a lot of vibrant colors, Other series that count with the same type of animation is the anime “Yuushibu” or “I couldn’t become a hero, So I reluctantly decided to get a job”. The bad though, Is that it seems that to rise the amount of BD sold, the uncensored version of this show airing on AT-X is using rather high end brightness which tend to render many of the beautiful screen captures found of this show too bright and useless to many.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The music is great, The voice actors are top notch and we are joined by Rias Gremory Voice actress “Yoko Hikasa”, So far I haven’t been disappointed with the choice of OP &amp; ED either.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
I recommend this anime to two sorts of people, The first are the ecchi veterans who can appreciate the series and the second are the folks that don’t mind women’s bodies and are up for a cold beer or soda chill and let the visuals stimulate you and do the talking for the first hit of 2017 on Ecchi goodness.<br />
<br />
If you’re anal and don’t like Ecchi anime, please do yourself a favor and stay away from this anime at all costs.  It is most like not your coup of tea. <br />

    Well its been a while since i&#039;ve seen something with this much uncensored glory... Just kidding. but it is one of the few new seasonal anime that fulfill this desire of mine. Basically this anime is a ecchi, uncensored fanservice oriented anime. And thats all there is to it. If it were rated my my own standards it would get a 10 just because uncensored stuff is so hard to come by in 2017. But of course... it ain&#039;t my standards you wanna see so here goes. <br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
Its honestly not that bad. Yea it&#039;s redundant (sorta), yea it replays some very overused elements from other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254196">
        ecchi animes, but If it were a standalone plot not considered in context of the anime&#039;s before it, then yea its a good story. Its not executed super well like some other amazingly ecchi animes with great plots, but plot wise this does make the cut of a fairly good plot. It has a storyline, it has a a protagonist and an antagonist, as well as a twist at the last episode so its not entirely trash. But then again keep in mind this was made to be fanservice, so cut the plot some slack. <br />
<br />
ART:<br />
Okay, I originally was going to give it a 10 just because... well things... okay just because of the uncensored tits, but then I looked past that (wow, so uncharacteristic) and i did have some complaints with it. First off, a solid 9/10 for uncensored titties and good quality art that comes from new technology and such. One point off for 1 thing: cutting corners/getting lazy. I dont know why, but the animation as the anime progressed got worse and worse. less actions were being animated, and it was pretty clear that the producer/animator wanted to get this over with. It was annoying and a small thing, but it was still persistent enough to bother me, especially in the last episode. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Gave it an 8, I don&#039;t really watch anime to listen to sounds. The voice actors were good I guess, nothing was really bad about it. It was more the ending song that bothered me. Its a personal preference but I just didn&#039;t like the way it sounds, and who was singing it. Other than that though...it was good. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Well... its good and bad. On the good side, there is a certain degree of character development for most of the characters, all the main ones as well as a good few side characters. Designs were great with the suits and stuff. On the other hand, the character development is pretty short, and not exactly well written to a point where it is believable. But what do you really expect with an anime geared toward fanservice? what? no one cares? yea i thought so... sadly<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: <br />
Personally I enjoyed it. There are alot of things that could have been improved, there are alot of things that could have been done better, but overall, I enjoyed watching it. Again, a big factor in this is the uncensored-ness. It wasn&#039;t executed in a way that the great ecchi animes were, so I didn&#039;t enjoy it perfectly, and also the laziness at the end really bothered me. <br />
<br />
Also I didn&#039;t like how there wasn&#039;t a male protagonist, or even a male sub-character to bask in the glory of all that uncensored goodness. I would like for that to be there<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Watch it for fanservice and you will like it. Watch it for plot and you probably won&#039;t. It&#039;s one of those kinds of anime. Personal grading is pretty much 3 for ecchi plot+ 2 for fantasy genre+ 5 for uncensored titties (ahem, i mean art) makes a good 10/10. but yea realistically, 1 for plot+ 1 for character +2 for art +3 for ecchi = 7/10. <br />
<br />
This just isn&#039;t an anime for everyone, and certainly not one you want to watch with your parents. <br />
<br />
Peace.

    This is a paragon example of a great concept with amazing execution. It may seem like a generic ecchi anime on the surface, but it quickly evolves into a deep and thrilling story-driven work of art.<br />
<br />
Story:10 The story itself is one of the best of all time, it manages to use elements from both Catholic and Demonic mythologies to create an action-packed fight for power. But action isn&#039;t all this anime has to offer, the story focuses more-so on the characters&#039; own development as individuals and how the different characters try to initiate and prevent the overtaking of hell. It&#039;s about a fallen angel strategically

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247004">
        plotting her next move to go against the odds and find the place where she truly belongs.<br />
<br />
Art:10 The art is appropriately vibrant. The setting and characters both have near-top-tier design which are suiting to their respective roles/personalities. Their proportions and detailing are both great. You can really feel the chillyness of frost areas, and the oompf of magic attacks. To generalize, almost everything is above average, it&#039;s major eye-candy.<br />
<br />
However, there is a problem which affects most anime- The airing version has a couple bad frames that look out of place. These are usually fixed when the BD comes out though. *The censored version&#039;s censorship is somewhat abundant too.<br />
<br />
Sound:10 The girls&#039; voices come across as being clear and they all sound like they fit their respective bodies. The SFX all pop up at the right times and there aren&#039;t really any times where it feels like they&#039;ve missed a sound opportunity. I&#039;m being a bit humble in saying that there wasn&#039;t anything wrong with the sound; rather, it is perfect.<br />
<br />
Character:10 Each of the main and sub characters have aesthetically appealing designs as well as really nicely fleshed-out archetype personalities. How characters react to each of the twists and turns is somewhat predictable because of this though. The creators did a stellar job of implementing personalities based around the Seven Deadly Sins without making the characters too overboard or eccentric. Their attitudes make it that much easier to get involved with the serious feeling of the story.<br />
Their costumes are all on the skimpy side, but they still manage to reflect and reinforce the characters&#039; personalities. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:10 This has been an absolute rollercoaster of fun so far, and it looks like things are just getting started! The story and characters are amazing.  The art and sound are absolutely delicious. It&#039;s hard to find anything about this anime which can&#039;t be enjoyed.<br />
<br />
Overall:10 This anime is above par in all of it&#039;s aspects. It wouldn&#039;t be an overstatement to say it is an absolute masterpiece that&#039;s easily one of the top 10 anime to have ever aired. <br />
Even if someone dislikes a certain aspect of this show whether it be demons/angels, fight scenes, ecchi, ect...- There are still tons of other high-quality features which can be enjoyed.

    Every media, every anime has it&#039;s sins. In this anime...seven isn&#039;t enough...<br />
<br />
Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai, not to be confused with Nanatsu no Taizai the shounen anime, is a fanserviced up to quite literal hell about the Seven Deadly Sins, more specifically how Lucifer became the Leader of the Seven Deadly Sins and the Demon Lord of Pride by tagging along and more or less torturing an innocent church girl by the name of Maria Totsuka.<br />
<br />
Before LA gets to sinning this anime, LA would point out the few, albeit &quot;good&quot; things Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai did. For one, the anime has shown it&#039;s research into Hell

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254176">
        in many aspects, from the Demon Lords as to how the Demon Lords of Melancholy and Vanity are even here which calls back to Eight Evil thoughts by Evagrius Ponticus and why Envy isn&#039;t a Demon Lord yet and the most obvious artistic liberty Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai did is with Dante&#039;s Inferno by referencing Cocytus as well as the Gates of Hell a la Circles of Hell. Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai&#039;s artistic liberties and referencing of Christian Hell is by in a ways a good alternative look into Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai&#039;s world and this draw adds into some of the Demon Lords. As such the Demon Lords Satan, Belphegor and Astaroth are probably the best character developed focused episodes as well as the most likable characters as they kinda followed suit to their symbolism to their sins respectively with Astaroth being LA&#039;s favourite character just from her likable personality as well as the best episode focused on her in this entire series however...she has her flaws but that a bit later.<br />
<br />
So, to sinning this anime. This anime is inconsistent as hell pardon the pun, but from episodes where yes they focused on the Sin of the Week, the inconsistency arises the quality of the episodes in question from outright horrible viewing experience to all-round good episodes and this affects the Sins in question as well. The Sins to fall victim to this are Asmodeus (Lust) because yes...the Lust episode is EXACTLY what you think to happen in a TNA anime, Mammon (Greed) for it&#039;s quality control broken (mainly the rigid fight scenes and plot stupidly off putting) and Mammon&#039;s development is rushed to all hell and Beelzebub (Gluttony) for being the reverse symbolism of her sins lore and being a rather fillery episode for her. Next sin and this is more obvious to a certain character and that&#039;s Maria, the tag along character and one of the main narrative-focused characters in the anime, she&#039;s a plain Mary Sue, that&#039;s kinda a problem in the outset but the biggest problem lies in the fact that she&#039;s tagged along for the ride and her motivations or development only concerns Lucifer nothing else...a perfect definition of a one-note character and she stands like this for the majority of the anime. Next sin goes obvious to the TNA part of this anime and it&#039;s all over the place, what&#039;s worse?...it&#039;s censored with these spinning red glyphs that gets in the way of it, LA gets WHY they did it, to make people buy the uncensored Blu-ray vers. of it but this practice pretty much needs to stop even in these ecchi-fest anime, as there is just no point when ohhh LA doesn&#039;t know, how about when we see violence here such as someone being stabbed in major detail (with blood pouring out of the stab wound) to some torturous BDSM imagery and fetishes shown in &quot;subtle detail&quot; &lt;LA looks at Charon &amp; Circles of Hell&gt; and THAT isn&#039;t censored yet TNA is, but yeah it&#039;s for the sales right?...geez this anime&#039;s censorship has Greed&#039;s prints all over it.  Next sin would go to Leviathan (Envy), she&#039;s the psycho lesbian of the anime and is completely in love with Lucifer but has to contend with Maria thus her envy, she is just an annoyance every scene she&#039;s in and she NEVER changes (though her psycho lesbian tendencies goes from yandere to tsundere), nonetheless one of the most annoying characters in the series. Next sin would go to Belial (Vainglory) and her motivations and backstory of her really, she&#039;s a one-note villain much like Maria is a one-note main protagonist, her motivations are just soo one-note it just makes her villainy all the more apparent and just to say &quot;I&#039;m the MAJOR VILLAIN...right?&quot;, her backstory feels half-assed in many aspects though some of the symbolism &quot;saves&quot; her but not enough, if you think Maria is bad as a bland character, LA thought Belial was much worse. The last sin would go to the ending in some ways, as much as it wanted to go out in a bang, the anime just found new ways for LA to question this notion, as such making us pity Lucifer to Belial and even Maria but was kinda undone by the finale anyways in many aspects and worst off was make Astaroth be a yes man to Belial but LA won&#039;t put THAT against her as again &quot;symbolism&quot; saved her from the disdain LA had towards the ending...NO the pure scorn LA had for this ending came in form of Maria and that &quot;miracle&quot; of an ass pull ending.<br />
<br />
 In terms of animation by TNK and Artland, the animation has it&#039;s high points with very exotic character designs (sans Belial&#039;s Gnosis outfit) and some of the backgrounding was very well done in some areas. Where the animation fell flat is in it&#039;s non-impactful battles as they mostly rely on beam-spamming to perspective-focused shots when some battles needed a wide-angel view of the impact, it is in a ways cutting corners for the battle scenes and probably next to the censored TNA, the battle scenes were lacking. To say the least, LA wanted to end the animation talk a bit more gracefully as it was mediocre to slightly above average at times but from what LA heard, Artland filed for bankruptcy, making this their last spurt...saddening but inevitably due to the reception Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai got.<br />
<br />
In terms of voice acting, ok so for Spring 2017, you know how LA had been hinting on Akane Fujita&#039;s voice acting, well her as Leviathan was probably the worst LA has seen her as, yes her annoying tendencies were THAT bad, but the worst voice actor would go to quite easily Megumi Toda as Maria, she was just straight up bland in most of her performance in which LA doesn&#039;t blame the voice actor as she didn&#039;t have much to work with but nonetheless. Ohh Shizuka Ito, LA wanted to like Belial and Shizuka Ito&#039;s prima donna villainy vocals weren&#039;t enough for LA to say that this is one of her most narmy and displeasing roles LA had seen from her (right next to her role as Suzuna Hiiragi from Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou (anyone remember that atrocity?)). On  the brighter note, Azusa Tadokoro as Astaroth, Eri Kitamura as Lucifer, Arisa Sakurada as Satan and Ai Kakuma as Belphegor were all great as their characters with Azusa Tadokoro being LA&#039;s favourite voice actor no matter how little screentime she got. Overall as much of a mixed bag of voice cast this anime has, the vocal work was ok if you withstand the &quot;moaning&quot; if you know what LA means...<br />
<br />
Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai is as much of an inconsistent mess as much as it&#039;s plot and as much LA likes the symbolism of this anime to the few likable characters given, it&#039;s &quot;symbolism&quot; and it&#039;s few developed to likable characters are NOT enough for LA to give it the grace LA would had given it. To be frank this anime like it&#039;s inconsistency fell into lots of titles for LA, from one of LA&#039;s guiltiest pleasures of Spring 2017, to one of the Top 3 worst animes of Spring 2017 to just &quot;meh ecchi series&quot; and really the fatal blow to Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai was it&#039;s ending that caused LA to say that Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai belongs in the Top 3 Worst Animes of Spring 2017 for LA, it has glimmers of a good TNA guilty pleasure anime with some Dante Inferno Sin lore but ultimately those glimmers were not enough for the mess of a plot, bland to annoying to lacking character development to half of it&#039;s cast, unnecessary censorship, lacking animation, how mean spirited it is and that asspull of an ending. <br />
<br />
Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai tries to be an anime with fanservice FIRST before having a plot to go with it, which is odd considering all the research they did to make the Seven Deadly Sins lore as well as the fanservice being obviously marred by the stupid censorship and &quot;crossing the line twice moments&quot;. But you just can&#039;t expect much from an anime where the focus is primarily on the forced TNA and Blu-ray sales.<br />
<br />
Which Circle of Hell would Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai be best put in? Fourth or Fifth?

    Trying to keep up with the story feels like trying to keep up with a mental institute all out of meds while you&#039;re being stabbed in the brain with a fork.<br />
<br />
The art and sound actually qualify for a whooping 8 but it&#039;s by no means consistent, it starts at 9 and slowly declines as the season continues to pollute your grey matter. After the first two episodes nobody keeps watching for anything other than the nudity since that&#039;s the only enjoyable thing you&#039;ve seen at that point but then you&#039;ve already seen half the nudity of the season because it starts trying to lean on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263028">
        the story instead of the one thing that made it worth watching at all.<br />
<br />
Ah this story is hard to describe... after the first episode I wanted to rate the story minus 5 billion because it was just randomly thrown together scenes, however after some time it is made clear that underneath it is an actual plot. Around 20% of what happens is actually somehow related to the plot, even if it&#039;s done in absolutely retardedly incoherent, inconsistent and illogically roundabout ways. The characters are beyond saving because every action they perform is to either get caught in tentacles that somehow dissolve their clothes or they attempt to do something related to the story. I do give a single point for the actual plot but it&#039;s buried beneath a mountain of idiocy.<br />
<br />
My advice: Just go watch hentai instead, many of them have a story that is at least coherent and the scenes go those important 3% further.

    sin: Nanatsu no Taizai began as an erotic and revolutionary hentai anime, however the quality dropped as time went by.<br />
If you&#039;re looking for an anime with deep plot, this is definitely not it. But if you love hot girls with supernatural powers fighting it out while stripping each others&#039; clothes off, this anime is for you, at least the first half.<br />
<br />
The underlying concept of an all girls anime with extremely lewd, erotic scenes and yet no explicit sex has rarely been done before, and Nanatsu no Taizai was so well executed I was really amazed by it at first. The lewd outfits and erotic scenes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256066">
        including tentacles and aphrodisiacs rivals hentai anime, indeed, this anime turned me on more than any hentai ever has.<br />
<br />
However the animation, story, and even erotic content decreased in quality as time went by, and ended with disappointment. I don&#039;t know much about directing anime and storyboarding, but the poor animation and still frames in the last few episodes really stuck out. I loved the erotic content so I didn&#039;t care for the story, but because even the erotic content was lessened, there was nothing to save the anime in the end.<br />
<br />
I was a big fan at the start, and I still love the erotic scenes in the first few episodes that are even better than hentai, and so I still recommend watching the first few episodes, but watching until the end might not be worth your time.<br />
<br />
I still give it a high rating of 8/10 for the first few episodes, because I had never seen anything else like it.

    Before I start my review of Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai, let me say one thing: I love demon girls. Demon girls are the ultimate type, and not just because they’re hot as hell. Although demons usually are cold-blooded blood-thirsting devilish creatures, they might show a softer side if you put “girl” together. Demon girls are violent, cold, lustful (and an optional amount of crazy), but they still are girls, therefore they want to go on dates, receive love and live a romantic story. Of course not all girls are girlish, many demon girls are devils that will rip your face off, but that definitely ain’t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386556">
        a problem ‘cause the bad girls are hot too. Plus, this unpredictability is part of the fun! Will you be able to bring out the best of your demon girlfriend? Or will you end up brutally murdered and torn into pieces? I don’t consider myself kinky, but if I were to have a kink it would probably be demon girls. Actually, I think I DO have a kink. Look, my love for demon girls is so massive I wrote a short poem:<br />
<br />
	Demon girls are the best!<br />
	The horns! The wings! The tail!<br />
	I might just be obsessed!<br />
	Demon girls never fail!<br />
<br />
You see? These bad girls not only can have a great personality, but they also have amazing physical attributes and quirks. Their body type or apparent age are totally optional, yet they’ll always have something fun like a tail or wings you can pull, or horns you can grab. And if you are too rough they can fight back with their long nails (or even claws) and fangs! Playing with demon girls sure is dangerous, however the enjoyment is unfathomable! I might have overtalked my deep love for demon girls here, but I can’t help myself! I love ‘em so much I have 15 wallpapers of demon girls that rotate on my phone… I’m not going to heaven, am I? …I can’t even pretend I’m bothered by that. Now, let’s just JUMP into it.<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10   <br />
The writer of this deadass looked at Lucifer—fallen archangel and lord of the underworld, corrupting the mortal realm and gathering strengths so he can go all-out against Heaven—and thought to himself “but can I put my dick in it?”<br />
It kinda follows Christian mythology, Lucifer falling from the sky and yada yada but in a modern setting. Lucifer then has to fight against some demon girls to dethrone them and become Queen Demon or whatever. Don’t expect many actual fights though, instead there’s a (Miami) beach episode, idols, videogames… Not exactly what you’d expect from an anime called “Seven Mortal Sins”. <br />
The story is simple yet enjoyable. It kinda has an episodic structure for the first 8 episodes, and they are very fun with lots of yummy fanservice (poor Maria, she suffers so much). Each episode is different, but they aren’t really original because they rely on ecchi tropes. But hey, that’s why we&#039;re here, right? You know, acid that only burns one’s clothing, slime, little sexual harassment here and there… Pussy torture… <br />
The story gets more straightforward (and trashy) during the last episodes, with some “epic” fights. The ending COULD be good, but they tried too hard and made some ass pulls. If they were more over the top (let’s say, like Kill la Kill), it would be more enjoyable and memorable.  <br />
<br />
Art: 4/10<br />
The demon girls alone are 8/10 (10 if they had wings and the other things I mentioned earlier), they’re thicc, with a very nice artstyle and designs (except for Belial) and UNCENSORED TITTIES. Backgrounds vary from meh to horrible. Animation is not that great, but it is not too jarring to look at as there isn’t really that much to animate other than tits ‘n’ ass, and they nailed that. The fights in the first episode were pretty good, but the rest was very stiff.<br />
Apparently the source material is just figurines, and DAMN they look GOOD. It’s the first time I hear about such thing getting an anime, it’s quite impressive. I probably shouldn’t review them here,  1-because figurines are not anime and 2-because I don’t have any, but I just want to say I would buy them if I could. I am sinning greed right now! Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai figurines are gorgeous, the colors are bright, the poses are sexy, the details are dazzling and the shading emphasizes their thickness! Ah, one more thing added to my “list of embarrassing things I want to buy once I become an adult and don’t have to ask for money to my parents.”<br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10<br />
The girls’ voices are hot. Okay soundtrack I guess, I was too focused on all the moaning so I barely noticed it. There are some vocal tracks that are stupid but fun to listen to. OP and ED are okay (I didn’t skip the ED once, but that has nothing to do with the music…).<br />
<br />
Characters: 6/10<br />
There’s no wimpy male protagonist, ‘cause there are no males! Remember when I asked whether one could put their dick in it? Well, there are no dicks, which honestly makes it better. Instead there’s lots of girl on girl action (so much it made me wish I was a lesbian girl. Actually, I had always wished that) and they are perfectly executed. There are 11 different pussies, except for 2, each pussy represents one of the seven capital sins (no, I did not get my maths wrong), yet there’s still more to it. Some of the pussies are deeper and better developed than you’d expect for an ecchi. Lucifer and Astaroth are best grils, but the all of them are good. My only complaint is that Maria could be better developed; she used to work for the church but didn’t seem too bothered hanging out with Lucifer and other demon girls. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: ∞/10<br />
I have a fetish.<br />

    Oh, well... I was not planning to write a review for MAL, it&#039;s the first (And I hope the last for a months) But, seeing what happens, I feel the need to do so.<br />
I apologize in advance for my horrible English.<br />
<br />
Ok, in first place we have something that alredy all people who had watched ecchi of all types knows: An ecchi yuri anime with more &quot;plot&quot; than plot.<br />
It&#039;s something not so usual than a harem, but normal, nothing special.<br />
<br />
In that case... What&#039;s the problem? Nothing. It&#039;s only other anime like Queen&#039;s Blade. But the people doesn&#039;t stop to hate. They hate something that praise in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review248446">
        other series. Too hypocritical. And there&#039;s the people who think this is the NNT shonen, it&#039;s fun.<br />
<br />
Returning to my &quot;first impressions&quot;, the design is the best of this show, excellent art, 9/10.<br />
The story and characters personality is normal. The sound... same.<br />
<br />
If you enjoy this type of anime, go ahead, you&#039;ll like it. And a fact that I like it&#039;s... they don&#039;t have a principal male character (Who sometimes ruins the story trying to &quot;steal the show&quot;)<br />
Don&#039;t wait so much of this Nanatsu No Taizai, only give it a chance and enjoy it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Saludos&quot;

    Sin nanatsu no taiza is the most beautiful and heart warming anime I&#039;ve seen in a while.  The first episode is Hamm packed full with action betrayal and romance. It&#039;s set in a fantasy world and follows the tale of lucifer from when she&#039;s thrown out of heaven and her struggle to become number one in hell. As she fights against the top demons of hell known as the sins. The over all anime has great animations and colours the sounds and music choice is impeccable, the characters are so deep and constantly changing that you feel instantly coneccted to them. The story is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review248439">
        so deep and rich with twists and turns as well as many trials for lucifer as she changes because of them to become the most powerful demon in hell. Overall this anime with its amazing character development and plot it definently is one of the more enjoyable anime being released at the moment and can&#039;t wait to see where the story goes.

    Well I&#039;ve managed to watch about 4 episodes of this shit, and I&#039;ve detested every moment of it. Hopefully it will get better as it goes on but watching this anime really does ruin my fucking day.<br />
<br />
Story - 2 : Crap at best, uninteresting and confusing. Am I missing something? I feel like there is a hell of a lot to be explained, everything just happens for no reason in this anime. People who can enjoy this story must really be dull upstairs. Perhaps more of EVERYTHING will be explained later on, and it better do well.<br />
<br />
Art - 7 : Industry Standard, cant really complain,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247294">
        good tiddies, although they&#039;re all massive. (Flat is justice)<br />
<br />
Sound - 7 : Once again, industry standard, can&#039;t complain, everything goes nicely and matches up etc etc.<br />
<br />
Character - 2 : I get they&#039;re physically 2D characters but did you have make their personalities so 2 dimensional as well? The most interesting character was levi, and she was shit. Every other character I&#039;ve seen so far are of typical tropes and obscene body figures, with no personality and no clear motive in what the fuck they&#039;re doing. Just a shit waifu-fest.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 1 : There&#039;s a reason I dropped this. See above.<br />
<br />
Overall I thought this was going to be a good anime, but for once I&#039;m saying that obscene fucking fan service has got in the way of a good plot and decent characters and their development, which is odd because I love the ecchi series, but this one just really isnt doing it for me. Terrible.

    This show is just hentai, there is no plot here. All of the plot that went into this show turned in huge tiddies. If you want to watch a show that has plot, this is not for you. If you want to watch hentai that isn&#039;t even good at being hentai, then go ahead and watch this shit-show. I truly regret every second i spent watching this, and when i think about the four hours of my life that went into this show i want to hurl. This has truly been a waste of part of my life and i pray that someone sees this

    You came here for the boobs. Be honest! So do yourself a favour and watch just the first 3 maybe 4 episodes. After that animation and drawing drops to the level taht even the nudity is unenjoyable. Pls there is less and less of it, and the anime concentrates more on the story which is rubbish and makes no sense. Music is fine.<br />
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!<br />
<br />
THe website wants me to write a longer review. but what could have been said about this anime I already said. I enjoy a little ecchi from time to time so I am not being puritan. But the combination of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308157">
        christian mythos, need to undress women, japanese wirldview, their dumb character motivations, dialogues the most disgusting sexual practices is a really, I mean REALLY bad combination.

    Creating fiction around religion does not bother me one bit because to me religion is already fictional. This series has a great concept idea for the plot and characters but does not quite deliver it. For example, it&#039;s much easier to pull off an ecchi/near hentai story with Lust as the main character than any other. <br />
<br />
Animation: <br />
1) the visuals are inconsistent at times<br />
2) the breasts either look weird or ugly and that&#039;s weird to me because I consider boobs beautiful <br />
3) sometimes the characters&#039; facial expressions do not match the emotions that they are expressing <br />
4) animation and dialog aren&#039;t always synced <br />
5) on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343211">
        the 9th episode, there&#039;s this bridge/path made of bones. When it breaks, you see the broken bones clearly but in the next sequence, the bones are instead turned into rocks and not only is that inaccurate in terms of Hell&#039;s mythology but also makes no sense in terms of continuity<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
1) the soundtrack is poor with the exception of 1 or 2 songs <br />
2) Sakuraba Arisa (Wrath/Satan) can&#039;t laugh at all which might be the reason why she doesn&#039;t have many roles <br />
<br />
<br />
Story and characters: <br />
1) I really like some of the ideas that this show presented: creating a story around Lucifer turning against God and becoming the King/Queen of Hell and proving that God is an hypocritical ego-maniac dictator and the rules he made up around the 7 deadly sins make no sense at all. I don&#039;t have a problem with the ecchi/near hentai scenes that obviously were the main focus for this anime but taking better advantage of the setting could&#039;ve improved this show a lot. I also hated how the story is set in the present day. <br />
2) The ending is anti-climatic and SPOILER: Maria&#039;s sacrifice felt pointless once she was revived. <br />
<br />
<br />
For me this anime is a 5/10 mainly due to the waste of an amazing setting and premise. <br />

    1:  Possibly better watched &quot;uncensored&quot;, simply because there isn&#039;t much story line to it, so can&#039;t really be ruined by the more lewd version.<br />
<br />
2:  It struggles between anime and hentai throughout most of the series, but finally begins getting pretty decent around episode 8 or 9 (i.e.: just as the show is almost over).<br />
<br />
Is it worth watching?  Ehh... not as a top pick, no, but it&#039;s not so bad as to avoid it.  Good if you&#039;re bored and casting about between one anime and your next, but not much more than that.  As anime: the last few episodes probably justify

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333619">
        having invested the time spent on the first 7 or so, I suppose; as hentai: hentai&#039;s not my thing at all, but I&#039;d wager that ero fans probably wouldn&#039;t be impressed by it either, and for the same reason (i.e.: the fact that it straddles the fence, rather than truly committing to either).

    All girls, sexy art, count me in is what I thought. <br />
Was looking for some nice &quot;all girls&quot; action, had to leave disappointed. <br />
Let me tell you why.<br />
<br />
Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai<br />
Review<br />
<br />
+++ PRO +++<br />
#Character designs are very sexy<br />
#Lots of ecchi (if you like that)<br />
#Artwork wasn´t that bad <br />
<br />
- - - CON - - -<br />
#Nothing noteworthy besides of horrendous amounts of ecchi<br />
#Didnt get what the anime was trying to be. At times felt like anime parody, other times tried to hard to be serious/emotionally.<br />
#Starts fine but you lose interest rather fast<br />
#Infinite Deus ex machina<br />
#Yes it has lots of nudity, but eventually you become accustomed to it and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257998">
        the rest of the show has nothing to offer so…<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
This will definetly be a show that I wont remember for long. Always on the lookout for nice yuri I saw this show and immediatly gave it a try. I am a fan of sexy and appealing art and at first glance this seemed promising. And hey, the first episode wasn´t even that bad, but what followed didn´t have much to offer. <br />
At times I even thought that I am watching a parody. Some episodes do have a certain theme. So without further spoilering just to give you an example one episode was about music and idols, another ep. about games. <br />
Well I can live with that, because we also have to take in account that this show provides you with ecchi and nudity all the time. But then again there are scenes where the anime is trying way to hard to be emotional and serious and that didn´t click for me.<br />
I didn´t like the female lead much. She was a lil bit of a badass, but not very feminine. You could have swapped her with a male mc and it wouldn´t have made any difference I guess. <br />
I  didn´t understand what this show wants to be. IMO it´s just plain bad and boring. And that one phenomen that people call &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot;, it happend A LOT.<br />
If you´re here for ecchi only, that´s okay, but I bet there are better shows with greater value.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
+++ So then tell me Kokosnuss who would you recommend this for? +++<br />
#Well if  you look more for a visual appeal than an actual story. (-&gt; fapshow, character designs are pretty good)<br />
#If you like all girl shows (&lt;- This is me. Cuz fuck those whiney ass male mcs) <br />
<br />
<br />
- - - I would not recommend this to you if you look for yuri - - -<br />
#Yes it has affection between characters, yet it´s not about romance.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    Just using the idea of sins isn&#039;t enough to make a show great. If all you want to is sexy girls wearing skin exposing outfits, and having mediocre stuffs which they termed as fights!!! A softcore porn lesbian hentai it was!!! It was all about the EXPOSE!!! The art style was was good. They wasted a lot of time on character designing, because t was nice but it had no plot or story to back it up!!! The surround sound was good too!!! Those wrap up the plus points. Trying to find negatives you will find tons. If want to watch this one-time watch show,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277978">
        keep your mind away from you while watching as there is no logic to it at all!! Very bad representation of the Ecchi genre. Moreover a confusing tile. Many viewers confused it for Seven Deadly Sins (Nanatsu no Taizai) a shonen anime which is really good as this series was in Japanese was called (Sin - Nanatsu no Taizai). The English translation did all it could to the title to avoid confusion with the other series. If you wanna watch this series, watch it in one go, or you&#039;ll be simply wasting your time!!

    When I first heard about this anime, I thought that it would be an interesting take on Christianity and Hell Fire with anime girls. I was sort of right. All I got was fan service with some of what I expected. I mean the best way I can describe this that I got what I wanted and nothing more.<br />
<br />
Story: Honestly this one is a mess as it goes all over the place. If it wanted to be monster of a week, fine by me. Instead there were some stuff shoehorned last minute in the last few episodes and some confusing motivations. Not only that, there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258903">
        were way too many cop outs and cheap endings from an anime that should of have some action which makes the experience not that exciting at times. Though it is a meh, don&#039;t watch this anime for the story and only the concept.<br />
<br />
Art: Again meh. When I first saw the concept art, I thought it was okay until I saw the actually anime which is less appealing in my taste. I thought that it would look cutesy and all but instead it is way too detailed and not that moe. The animation is a big meh with some exceptions as the budget seemed to have gone to some other aspects. When it does get good, it&#039;s good but it barely happens. I have heard that it went over budget so that might be the case.<br />
<br />
Sound: Meh. I did like some of the songs, mostly the cute ones. The voice acting however is really good at least. Just want to point out that the English dub acting is funnier as some of the actresses really put some personality either it be better than the sub or something new.<br />
<br />
Character: I&#039;ll start with the good. When they act like demons, it&#039;s very sexual but it is what I expect. One of the few things I want to see in this series is to see demons getting all hell fire up on yo ass. This series did have some of those moments. Each demon character represent their own sins pretty well in addition of having an interesting interpretation of them.<br />
<br />
The biggest flaws is that they did not take advantage of this. There is the fact that they are one dimensional, the fan service gets in the way, and they are suppose to be the good guys. See, I&#039;m okay with demons or bad people being heroes, but it does not work here for many reasons. Their motivations made no sense at times so what is the point, they are way too evil for that, and also they are freaking demons! It&#039;s their job to torture people in hell, but nope. The only real demon is into torture while the others are not into it. Ladies, it&#039;s your job.<br />
<br />
Then you have the main human character, Maria, who is for the most part is bland but her character development is Stockholm syndrome. Also the worse character in my opinion is that demon with blue armor that barely covers her. I just find her annoying, bratty, and not that appealing.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: When it delivers, it delivers. When it doesn&#039;t, it doesn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Overall: It just gives us what we ask for. That is it. It doesn&#039;t do more and sadly less. Do I recommend it, you may need to have some tolerance and not take the series seriously. I ended up comparing this series to Spongebob. Kind of personally enjoy this series despite some of the issues and I don&#039;t really care for the fanservice unless I joke around.

    I&#039;ll include OVA as well into part of my review, because they are shorts and if you liked SNnT you will watch OVA anyway.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll be using my ecchi category rating so it won&#039;t be rated as a &quot; normal anime&quot; so keep that in mind.<br />
<br />
I will be rating ANIME so I won&#039;t be comparing how well it represent LN or manga.<br />
<br />
\\ spoiler alert just in case //<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
Edit: Through ( not trough Peter) the season we&#039;ll visit many places, like Miami, online game or London, so there&#039;s quite the variety.<br />
<br />
Characters: 5/10<br />
Sin: Nanatzu no Taizai doesn&#039;t have any male character which is dissapointing. Our MC is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313574">
        Lucifer, she&#039;s fallen from heaven and now is aiming to become leader of the 7 deadly/mortal Sins. Our 2nd MC is Maria, she possess Lucifer&#039;s angel blood, which can be used to find Sins. Our 3rd MC&#039;s Leviathan, she&#039;s very obsessed with Lucifer and she&#039;s trying her best to &quot; please&quot; Lucifer.<br />
<br />
Character progression: 5/10<br />
We see some bonding, little progress, but overall our characters doesn&#039;t develop much, except of main 3.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
Story follows Lucifer fall from heavens and rising to leadership of seven mortal/deadly Sins. Through the season she&#039;s defeating Sins in order to lift her curse. She&#039;s challenging Sins in aspects of those sins, coming on top and eventually after reaching her goal she gets to fight archangel Michael.<br />
<br />
Story progression: 7/10<br />
Main story only. It is fluent, not much to add.<br />
<br />
Villains: 7/10<br />
Belial: 7/10 Her main goal is to return to heaven, she&#039;s from Byrnedale family, later inherited Belial as her name. She has background, check. She isn&#039;t artificially villainised, check. She is powerful, but not stupidly OP, check. For an Ecchi decent villain.<br />
<br />
Girls: 10/10 ( I am including Nanatsu no Bitoku)<br />
Girls only, what did you expect? Massive breasted girls, check. Big breasted girls, check. Medium breasted girls, check. Small breasted girls, check. Butt action, check. SNnT and NnB combined have around 15 girls, so there&#039;s really huge variation.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Both opening and ending are pretty good, ending is really fitting.<br />
<br />
So overall rating of Sin: Nanatzu no Taizai is 7,13/10 that means 7/10. It has really good fanservice and if you don&#039;t have big requirements on the story, you will enjoy it.

    Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai  is an attempt by company HobbyJapan to cash in on their line of extra-lewd figures and make a fanservice-heavy ecchi show.  Unfortunately attempts to subvert tropes and introduce an actual plot into the show derail both aspects leaving it a clunky mess that does a poor job of both the ecchi and any hopes for an actual story.<br />
<br />
I went into Sin knowing that it was borderline hentai at points, and for the most part the first 3 episodes did just that.  Plenty of nudity, suggestive moaning, and innuendo set the stage for what I thought would be an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309257">
        enjoyable show.  <br />
<br />
However after the first 3 episodes things begin to slow down to a snails pace as it was apparently decided to cut back on the ecchi content and attempt to build up to an actual story for a few episodes.  This shift in tone is poorly done and is arguably the time my hopes of enjoying myself begin to dwindle.  <br />
<br />
The final few episodes attempt at creating a grand story but by then it is too little to late.  The grand conflict is boring, the power tiers don&#039;t make any sense, and there is almost no fanservice in the final episode at all.<br />
<br />
One major point of contention I have is that our main character Lucifer, is somehow capable of defeating Demon Lords, yet this is never explained why she is able to.  The Demon Lords are almost incompetent with how easily they are dispatched, making you wonder why Heaven and Hell were ever at war in the first place.  Nor is it ever explained why these demon lords are subservient to one of their own kind.  One would think this a minor point in a show that would love for the chance to have female demons dominating each other, but when such a heavy focus of ACTUAL plot is placed upon the hierarchy you would hope it is actually explained why it is necessary.<br />
<br />
A highlight of the show is that some of the Demon Lords are actually quite well designed with Belphegor (Sloth) being a stand out for me. Her VA Ai Kakuma delivered a great performance that gave the character a unique personality, and perfectly captured the voice of a wonderfully designed Demon Lord. It made me wish Sloth could have her own SoL show, eating chips and playing video games while the world passes her by.  <br />
<br />
However a few of the Main Characters do detract from the supporting ensemble and help to further bring the show down.  A chief culprit of this is Leviathan, whose whiny &quot;Onee-san&quot; gets more annoying each and every episode.  Her story is yet another example of the show not fleshing out either it&#039;s fanservice or its plot well.  (WHY is she so obsessed with Lucifer?  If Leviathan has the powers that are almost on par with a Demon Lord why does the show make it seem like none of the ACTUAL Demon Lords have ever interacted with her before.)<br />
<br />
Arguably worse is our human character Maria, who becomes bound to Lucifer through her heart being stolen and Angel blood being placed into her body. Another plot point that is barely explained, yet apparently essential for the actual &quot;story&quot;. <br />
<br />
In the first 3 episodes it appears to the viewer that she will be the &quot;prop&quot; for the Demon Lords to fight over (Lust attempting to &quot;break&quot; her sexually so that she can lay claim to Lucifer&#039;s property) and while this isn&#039;t the most original idea, it could have played out well if cleverly incorporated into the other Demon Lords realms (Rage, Sloth, etc.).  However when the show dials back the fanservice in the middle of the season we begin to see a rather disturbing case of unintentional Stockholm Syndrome begin to happen, with Maria somehow siding with Lucifer and growing closer to Lucifer even though this person has robbed her of her freedom (and potentially any chance of innocence or a normal life).  In the middle episodes Leviathan gets stereo-typically jealous of Lucifer paying more attention to Maria, and Maria&#039;s innocence and naivety gets her into more trouble that Lucifer has to rescue her from. Somehow Maria makes no attempts to regain her freedom and instead begins to grow closer to Lucifer as a result of these actions (Oh she rescued me, she does care about/she isn&#039;t all that bad).<br />
<br />
A highlight is that each of the Demon Lord&#039;s specific episodes does feature an original song sung by each of their respective VA&#039;s.  These are all very well done and help break up the monotony of the orchestral score we often get in series such as this.<br />
<br />
In the end Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai is a completely forgettable show from a studio that shut it&#039;s doors before it could even air all 12 episodes in a timely fashion.  It&#039;s attempts at subversion failed to entice, and it&#039;s attempts at fanservice weren&#039;t enough to make it memorable when compared to all the other quality shows that are able to do both simultaneously.

    That moment you realize you&#039;ve been rooting for Hell to win....<br />
<br />
I&#039;m surprised that i&#039;m only now watching this. I enjoyed this.<br />
<br />
The art is awesome, Especially when you realize this is very echi material in this and shows like that tend to be very low budget and very lazy art. If i had one complaint then i&#039;d say its turn the fucking lighting down ffs. There are some scenes it can be hard to see anything. <br />
<br />
I like all the characters and all but one of the Seven Sins.<br />
<br />
Lucifer ( Pride) :<br />
She being the main character means that she should be a fun character to have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273072">
        on screen. For the most part she is. I can&#039;t really recall anytime i found her to be annoying or have any flaw in her character really. I don&#039;t like how defenseless she can be. Especially when she is meant to be the strongest Angel ( Now Demon Lord) The amount of times she could&#039;ve been killed but wasn&#039;t because of the villain is a ton. Also i got really confused with her name. Cause she is called Lucifer when that is the name of the Devil aka Satan. So i thought we were getting some alternate version of the bible that has the Devil/Satan start out in the modern day and some type of weird crap happens with time and even though it starts out in modern day it also affects the past or some dumb crap. But nope cause later we find out that a character named Satan is in this. Doesn&#039;t explain shit and i guess it&#039;s for the best. <br />
<br />
Leviathan ( Envy ):<br />
She is one of the two companions that Lucifer has. She can get annoying at times i&#039;d say but for the most part she is a good comic relief character. Kind of sad that she doesn&#039;t have some ultimate form where when she is pissed she turns into some type of Leviathan that you&#039;d find in old stories.<br />
<br />
Astaroth ( Melancholy ) : <br />
Not much to say about her. She was the first Sin we are introduced too that isn&#039;t all that rude. Makes sense cause her name is melancholy. Not the most interesting character but she isn&#039;t bad either.<br />
<br />
Satan ( Wrath ):<br />
Having someone named Satan and not having their attribute be Wrath is just plain wrong. Only other thing that would work for someone with such a name would be Slyness. I like her. Defiantly up there with my favorite. I especially like her character design. Her job of guarding the Gates of Hell also seems to be a very fitting position.<br />
<br />
Asmodeus ( Lust ) :<br />
She&#039;s a whore, Not much else to say...... Well i guess i do like her character but is one of the more forgettable conquest that Lucifer has to overcome and as a result not leaving much of an impact on the viewer. <br />
<br />
Beelzebub ( Gluttony ) :<br />
It&#039;d figures that Japan would give the sin with the biggest reputation of being gross over indulgence to a cute and petite looking loli. She&#039;s also 1st or 2nd best girl and if you disagree then you&#039;re wrong. Also the only normal character among the group of sins. <br />
<br />
Belphegor ( Sloth) :<br />
The fuck is that tail ? That shit bugs me and i&#039;m not even sure why. But the girl is fun and probably has one of the funnest conquest that Lucifer has to overcome. <br />
<br />
Mammon ( Greed ) : <br />
Now for Greed i&#039;m not sure why but i like&#039;d her character. Even with her having a forgettable Conquest. I don&#039;t know what it is about her. Also her putting people into dreams to take care of her babies by breast feeding the victims is an interesting power....<br />
<br />
Belial ( Vanity ) :<br />
With her it&#039;s just... She isn&#039;t all that exciting or interesting of a villain. The plot with her is so obvious that other characters start calling her out on not noticing it. For her to be the incarnation of Vanity she&#039;s also not all that special looking. You&#039;d think she&#039;d be more beautiful like a Princess then looking like a discount slut. She&#039;s also just not that great of a character overall. I guess she&#039;s not as bad as i make her out to be but i feel that they could&#039;ve made her better.<br />
<br />
Now with the one human character in this.<br />
<br />
Maria ( She&#039;s a human so obviously this spot is N/A)<br />
I like her and she is an awesome partner for Lucifer. I ship them and even the show does. I just wish we got more of her on the screen and i&#039;d even love for us to see her interacting with her friends and family that have no idea where she went and see their reactions to Lucifer being around her.<br />
<br />
Really the plot where God and Heaven are wanting to destroy earth is something i find to be dumb. It&#039;s like they had God just be a cliche typical villain that want&#039;s to destroy Humanity for X reason. We don&#039;t even see him. <br />
<br />
I kind of wish we got a ending with both Maria and Lucifer together. I feel it&#039;d be better. <br />
<br />
Show also has some pretty awesome music, Especially that ED.<br />
<br />
Overall a pretty fun show that i&#039;m not sure why has such low reviews. If it&#039;s because you are watching the censored version then i feel that&#039;s not much of a reason and just find it somewhere else to watch. I defiantly see this being more at a position around a 7.4 - 8.0.
