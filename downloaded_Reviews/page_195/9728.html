    This anime is extraordinary!<br />
<br />
Even when stacked up against Isekai abominations like Death March and Isekai wa Smartphone, it still somehow manages to be even worse! In fact, this might just be the worst Isekai anime that I’ve seen to date, and considering the generally poor quality of the genre, that’s really saying something. So yes, this anime (whatever the hell its name is) is definitely incredible!<br />
<br />
Incredibly bad.<br />
<br />
This anime doesn’t even bother to start with the protagonist getting inexplicably transported to a fantasy world. When we’re introduced to him, he’s already been in another world for two years, so it’s almost like this isn’t even an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285004">
        Isekai anime. Gotta love dat lazy writing! Anyway, our protagonist, named Super Ultra Omnipotent Usurper, or Suou for short, is, you guessed it, a perfect being in every way! He’s the most morally just and relatable character ever, is a military genius, and, most importantly, gets all the bitches! Actually, only the latter is true, but the anime still desperately tries to give him character traits that make him more than just a chick magnet. Too bad they fail miserably. <br />
<br />
Suou is a conqueror, plain and simple. Not of nations, but of women. Yet what makes him stand out from his fellow Kirito clones? Well, Suou is unique in that when he claims a girl as his property, he makes her a part of his “family.” Thats right, this guy forces his women to become his little sisters and daughters, and makes them address him as “papa” and “big brother.” What a sick bastard. He also doesn’t seem to give a crap about his soldiers and doesn’t bat an eye when they’re slaughtered in combat. And the best part is that the writers still try to portray him as an “I am holier than thou” type of character. What a guy!<br />
<br />
Thanks to the solar powered smartphone that Suou just so happens to have (Sigh…I don’t even care anymore), our hero is able to look up military tactics of great historical leaders like Alexander the Great and Sun Tzu and implement them in battles. Of course you really can’t tell what battle strategies are being used during fight scenes due to the hideous visuals that make everything look like an utter mess. There are even some scenes that are repeated several times within the same battle because the animators couldn’t be bothered to actually do their job. <br />
<br />
A random red haired dude in this anime wisely said “the details don’t matter.” I think the writers must have taken that sentence to heart. Nothing about this anime makes any sense. The plot thus far has gone nowhere, the characters are painfully bland and annoying, and the show isn’t fun to watch. And if you’re watching this for the sole purpose of beating your meat to sexy 2D anime waifus, don’t. It just isn’t worth it.

    The Master of Ragnarok and Blesser of Einherjar is a truly humiliating work. It’s so comically inept and earnest in the name of its intended ambitions and atrocities that it becomes endearingly pathetic for a while. I was wholly prepared to come write about how this show was the ultimate waste of time in terms of creating it, watching it, and especially reviewing it. It still is in many ways, especially when it becomes downright insufferable later on, but this deformed gem belongs in the same realm as classics such as Big Order and The Room. I mean, just look at this thing, this clueless,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289684">
        fugly piece of shit!<br />
<br />
This show is the penultimate production shitshow! To begin with the easiest of targets, the CGI is as prevalent as it is laughable. The stills are more frequent than bits of animation, resulting in some garbage action and hentai-like sequences. The animated fight sequences aren’t much better, so it’s nigh impossible to appreciate the “action” on any level.. As if all that wasn&#039;t enough, the people at studio EMT² created this terrible Ufotable-esque art-style similar to the infamous Chaos Dragon, and they struggled heavily to keep their character models consistently drawn. Shame cuz some of the women are so hot that they deserve much better, at least until you realize what utter objects they all are. That’s when it becomes debatable.<br />
<br />
The female characters in this show are borderline humiliating, especially the twin additions to the harem. While they’re at the very least varied in terms of what kind of objects they are and even much of an object they’re characterized as -unlike in Smartphone- they’re still barely effective at best and downright worthless at worst. The best things I can say about them is that they don’t blatantly fall into any archetype and that some of their designs, namely Siegrune’s, are cool and have fun clothing. The later ones are so disastrously infuriating and worthless that after the pink-haired girl showed up, they should have stopped this process altogether and spent more time fleshing out we had. Their leader, Yuuto, is downright hysterical; he is a total piece of shit. Outside of the bitches he collects, patronizes, and still refuses to bone, and this one girlfriend he has at home (along with the few generals and whatnot who are useful), he treats everyone under his ranks with as much contempt as the most reprehensible regime leader villains in anime history. This man will force you to become his slave child or his barely any less subservient little sister, and threaten to massacre your clan if you don’t comply. His mistresses are all either his children or little sisters, which is obviously for the most unashamedly fetishistic sexual gratitude or both him and the intended audience. We’re supposed to treat him like a normal harem protagonist cuz he still has most of their hallmarks, or a decent human being just because he regrets having been worse? Fuck outta here! That’s like saying we’re supposed to pretend any of the remaining side-characters aren’t the most one-note and worthless things ever. Even he knows how awful he is, and some of it isn’t even his fault.<br />
<br />
The fact that with all this, they still try to set up moments and entire plot-lines with intrigue, attempt to have character arcs with peak “emotional moments”, and take this show’s story seriously with emotional music and close-ups of women crying in joy or despair to boot, is as rich as it is tragic. It attempts all of that in the name of selling this kind of disastrously nonsensical, badly paced, convoluted, excess, and ill-defined material as something worth getting invested in. They even have several decent fantasy music for the title cards and scenes related to the ongoing war that are often only heard once. When Overlord is just sitting there, cackling in the corner with its superior OP/ED music in the same season this bullfuckery airs, things need to start being re-evaluated. In spite of all this, this show actually tries to indirectly explain the origins of this main character becoming an Isekai protagonist with a single moment of visual storytelling in the opening before eventually elaborating on it. Mad props for the idea, even if the end result was convoluted. For that alone, this thing ain’t as bad as Smartphone, let alone worthy of being called the worst Isekai ever made. <br />
<br />
Obviously, the quest of enduring this embarrassment is not for everyone. Most of its problems are so self-evident that not only are several of them displayed by the title and cover art, but people not keen on wasting their time would be doing exactly that by watching this thing. This blend of ambition, degeneracy, laziness, and ineptitude is a beast meant for only the most skilled hate-watchers to slay. Even I barely survived half of what happened past the fifth episode, and I was having a blast early on and towards the end. For the brave few who choose to embark, and the animation buffs willing to give this a shot, grab a party. and/or alter your state of consciousness first. If you genuinely enjoy something like this, let nothing stop you other than some mind-shatteringly awful filler episodes. All others can pretend this show doesn’t exist; you’re missing nothing of value by doing so.

    I was supposed to get me one of those solar ray powered telephone calling systems that grant the access to a fantasy world filled with countless lady persons, but Amazon had sold them out when my telegraph reached their end. Damn it. <br />
<br />
Suou Yuuto is one of those lucky bastards who didn&#039;t get ninja&#039;d by scalpers, and now he lives the perfect life as the lawfull harem-bro to these MWWM&#039;s. No, it does not stand for my wild waifu maiden, but magic-wielding warrior maiden. Basically, anyone with a female knight fetish could pay decent amounts of money for a device like that. If you happen

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284988">
        to know where I could get one, leave me a pm (asking for a friend).<br />

On a less serious note, whateverrandom words Valkyria is an anime series you most likely would not/will not enjoy for the reason that it is a copy-paste of every smartphone self-insert harem. The selling point of these series has always been how bad they are, but the sole amount of worth of nothing series has pushed the standards so high that these days bad series need to be impressively bad for them to be worth of anything. Valkyria does not impress with its lack of quality, and that is its biggest flaw. <br />
<br />
Basically, this series is like Kingdom if it had been an excuse for generic isekai harem where the mc is the perfect Garu Stu Jesus and female characters just numbers. Speaking of excuses, every bit from the war settings and battles to backstories and slice of life moments are nothing but excuses for our mc to interact with his harem, and add more lady persons to it. Let&#039;s be honest here: For this series to ever be wort of anything at all: it should have been hentai.

    A popular genre of late, another &quot;I&#039;ve been summoned to another world&quot; Anime begins. This one drops you into the story in progress, but here are the other things you should know about this take on the alternate world going in:<br />
- Harem. Pretty standard for this genre, and this story is no exception.<br />
- Fanservice plus sexual references. Also typical of this genre.<br />
- The protagonist&#039;s special power is knowledge via cellphone, IE using the knowledge of technology and historical battle strategies.<br />
- The setting is a slightly magical version of the Bronze Age.<br />
The drawing is average, and in scenes with large numbers of people they take advantage

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285000">
        of mid-level CG. The animation is also mid level. Plot-wise it may have the same general issues many similar anime have in that the protagonist may never really have to struggle, however this plot is far better constructed than &quot;In Another World with my Smart Phone&quot; or &quot;Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody&quot;. That is to say there is a clear objective the protagonist desires to reach, rather than randomly wandering and gathering females. Whether that holds out as the series progresses will remain to be seen.<br />
<br />
While I personally don&#039;t really care for aggressive fanservice or over the top harems (&#039;pat my head big brother!&#039;), this anime had enough going for it that if you are a fan of the genre this is one of the better recent options.

    Isekai... The term in anime that I really want to avoid due to some anime being isekai and trash as well.. But I can&#039;t help reviewing this trash of an anime because I was also one of the few who reviewed a similar anime last year.. And coincidentally that anime aired in summer season of anime as well. Now, I don&#039;t have a grudge on all isekai anime (as you may know I love Overlord and Log Horizon), but this type of Isekai where the protagonist are just so generic along with his harem is just... bad. And this anime just transcended from the bad

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289682">
        one to a worst one. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story is simple to summarize. Guy named Yuuto got transported into a fantasy world filled with Norse mythology. Along him is his trusty sidekick named &quot;Smartphone&quot; where on the first episode, we were slammed already by him being the most important character in the world not even showing us how he did it or some sort. There we saw him winning and winning wars with other clans with his harem that is op which he collected by pokeballs, oh I mean which he collected by his &quot;great&quot; leadership or &quot;handsome&quot; face. Ever wonder how he wins wars? By searching through the internet by his smartphone! Of course there is a WiFi connection in the distant past. Very good story am I right? Along with wars we saw him getting harassed by his Pokemons by means of seducing him but at least he is loyal to his friend in the real world which he can actually talk to even tho he is on the other world already.  Master Of Ragnarok And The Blesser Of Einherjar is a great anime for those who love those silly cliche types of things on a story. But as for me, it is not. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
If the protagonist sounds bad to you, well the others are as well, especially the girls. Looking at the MC,  throughout the episodes I can only sense that... his a good person and thats it.. Development on his traits was not at all present or should I say character development is not at all present in my eyes. We know he is a teenage high schooler but still that doesn&#039;t state what he really is or his other traits are. Is he a psychopath that will kill anyone by his own hands? Is he someone willing to sacrifice his own smartphone in exchange to another girl? Maybe he is. And throughout the series we just see him gaining more and more girls even though it is so unnecessary already. Speaking of the girls, they are your typical harem anime girls that their attention is always on the lame MC and always praising how good, caring and great of a person he is.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
If you are talking about great anime, meaning the anime have a ton of eye-catching visuals either from funny scenes, jam-packed actions or the environment. Ragnarok (or shall I call it MORBOE?), however, fails to please my eyes. Instead it gave me sore eyes with amateur art styles and low budget action scenes of medieval soldiers and horses fighting and stuffs. It was like looking into a 9 year old&#039;s coloring book. Not to mention for some reason the ecchi scenes are not really turning me on. Maybe because the eyes of the characters are too much of an anime eye or maybe almost all the girls have little-girl like figures. The opening is not that pleasing for me both visually and musically as well as the ending being topped off with the girls being naked to satisfy your ecchi needs... if you like this anime.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Every anime fan have a playlists of anime openings or endings. Even include the OST&#039;s (background music) of the anime. Sadly, no music will go to my playlist from this anime. My taste of anime music doesn&#039;t fit the opening as well as the ending. Background musics are ehh.. I don&#039;t even bother anymore<br />
<br />
Overall thoughts and Enjoyment:<br />
In conclusion, Master Of Ragnarok and The Blesser Of Einherjar is an anime for those who love isekai trash anime like In Another World With My Smartphone. Heck this is way worse than the smartphone anime so if you like this type of stuffs, I recommend you to join Yuuto&#039;s quest on getting more Pokemon girls.<br />

    Hayao Miyazaki once said: &quot;Anime was a mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
And yet in 2018, we have 2 series that stand out much: Winter&#039;s Mahou Shoujo Site and this season&#039;s abominable, unwatchable, god-damn mess of an isekai-harem, I proudly present to you...Hyakuren no Haou to Seiyaku no Valkyria, or what I&#039;d like to call: The Master of Ragna-&quot;Rock Bottom&quot; &amp; &quot;Teenage-Loli Harems AF&quot; of Einherjar. And not even the Anime Pope (Mother&#039;s Basement) has the quintessential formula to save you from the endless frustration of the amount of quirks that this show has going for.<br />
<br />
&quot;This anime is a lot of nothing, BUT a whole lot of nothing.&quot; - Geoff

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289679">
        Thew, professional shitbag, signing out from my Mother&#039;s Basement.<br />
<br />
I thought that Isekai Smartphone from the same season last year and Winter&#039;s Death March were unimpressive, unimaginative and best of all, boring as molasses...but this shitshow made EVERY mediocre isekai-harem anime-adapted series (be it LN or manga) before this look like winning formulas in my book (and rightfully yours too).<br />
<br />
Error No. 1: Story is mind-numbingly conceived out of some tried-and-true references that is uncanningly cringeworthy.<br />
What to expect from the fantasy-LN source that was made in 2013, just when the Isekai genre has already been saturated enough? Make some more I guess! That was the nail in the coffin of Seiichi Takayama&#039;s absolute failure to come up with something that what is already considered a cash cow and a safety net, and his creativity really is off the charts. Not to mention that at the time before the anime adaptation, this series has 15 volumes (and counting) when the anime adaptation was announced in early March this year! And the financier backing this up? Yup, you guessed it, it&#039;s not Japan, it&#039;s China (with video platform bilibili&#039;s help)! Oh good God, why???<br />
<br />
You want the story? Heck and hell, I&#039;ll just summarize here:<br />
- Random guy by the name of Suuou Yuuto takes selfie, got Isekai-ed by a cursed mirror into Yggdrasil (where most isekai stories already established that long, long time ago BUT better executed) where clans have an all-out battle to see who reigns supreme...<br />
<br />
- Surprise, surprise! Along with him comes a god-damn solar-powered Smartphone! And thank God Isekai Smartphone&#039;s execution is heaps better than this (but still not good) since Natsuko Takahashi, the series composer for both series, came back to hem this job. And honestly, after her work on the fabulous Ore Monogatari in 2015, the majority of the remainders are just plain shovel-ware, and this is no different.<br />
<br />
- Deal breaker No. 1: Searching on Wikipedia for war tactics in Yggdrasil...how blatant is this? As if the clan he is responsible in only benefits on the knowledge of the technology, NOT the human! Yuuto has none of it all, he just has the technology-powered Norse mythology going for him while everyone calls him &quot;Father / Big Brother&quot; since he&#039;s the patriarch...it&#039;s a &quot;cheat&quot; he says, but I&#039;m not buying that fact at all, and that&#039;s that is going for our dear god-awful MC.<br />
<br />
- Deal breaker No. 2: All the teenage and loli girls beside &quot;The Master of Ragna-&quot;Rock Bottom&quot;? Other than being used for battle (that&#039;s why they are called Einherjars, masters and blessers of unique abilities), they can do one more thing: Harass and caress the male MC for reasons our human minds can conceive why, but for what purpose...?<br />
<br />
The story and setting are both incredibly bad to the point that I can sleep when the episode starts and wake up at the ED song! Simply, just great. Not to mention that Kousuke Kobayashi, the (not 2nd but toxic upgraded) 3rd-rate director behind last season&#039;s obnoxious short Alice to Alice, hasn&#039;t learned his lesson much, and the production staff under him already gave up trying a lot here. I know the harsh anime industry where are budget limitations, but this show really scrapes that line a whole lot.<br />
<br />
Error No. 2: Characters (not the VAs), aside from their &quot;unique&quot; traits, are nothing short of mediocrity, the bottom of the barrel. <br />
Suou Yuuto...generic as he is, he has the goody-two-shoes feel, until some people have to wake up his ideas and be firm, he did. Problem is, he cannot be straight, and always has to compromise to please everyone. Oh, come on! You can do a better job...right? And your unimpressive denseness is a legit pointing-finger major crisis!<br />
<br />
The Einherjar maidens (Felicia, Siegrune, Linnea, Ingrid, the 2 loli sisters) and even his OWN sister Mitsuki...wow are they a sight to behold! Nah, just kidding, who can I kid when majority of them &quot;set their aims&quot; at Yuuto while he flusters with the little sense that he has. Not to mention that their sole purpose is to battle, and while at it, fight for &quot;supremacy&quot; to be the right-hand &quot;embracing&quot; man of Yuuto. <br />
<br />
Yuuto&#039;s opposition (with the de-facto clans with the blonde he calls &quot;Bro&quot; and Steinphor) is hands-down the ONLY part that is decent, as they have balls to show off their power and at least be competent somewhat. I presume at least this area, the production staff tried at least a teeny-weeny effort for them to stand out, and they did, albeit for their screen-time moments.<br />

Error No. 3: Art and animation sucks balls...HARD enough to crash and burn.<br />
EMT Squared is a newcomer studio, but that doesn&#039;t mean that you have ALL authority to give them this project to handle...and it shows and reflects very badly from start to end. Action sequences are off with the wrong camera focuses and the many stills; character designs are super-off and deformed in terms of body and faces (especially one-sided faces where the designers super-cheaped-out and cut out on drawing 1 eye instead of both), not to mention the stale background art and obsolete animation quality.<br />
<br />
Error No. 4: Forget about the music aesthetics, they are the worst in terms of representation.<br />
I absolutely despise the sound choices done here, nothing here is ever noteworthy, so don&#039;t get me started...except I&#039;m doing that now. The OST is horrible, sound effects at the level of LOLs and hilariously-unfunny bad placements.<br />
<br />
We all never once thought there could be any other anime that will be scraping the bottom of the barrel, but this anime proved us wrong. Bland. boring, cliché, flat, tiresome, you name it, this anime has it all. Whatever it is, this anime is an outright waste-barrel of an excuse of time, talents and effort, and should be shunned and abstained at all costs.

    The Master of Ragnarok &amp; Blesser of Einherjar or as I like to call it The Master of Rock Bottom is garbage. This is what happens when a studio named Em2 copies and pastes the world most uninspired Iseaki anime (In Another World With My Smartphone). With writing, direction and production so bad it makes shows like Black Clover and Darling in the Franxx look competent. The Master of Ragnarok &amp; Blesser of Einherjar is empty filled of nothingness that can&#039;t even respect its own target audience correctly. The show itself is horrendously written crap in the very beginning with numerous red flags popping up over

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289690">
        the course of it that would quickly lead to series killing problems.<br />
<br />
Yuuto Suoh is a normal high school student who is knowledgeable about urban legends. In order to prove one of these legends, he and his childhood friend Mitsuki Shimoya visit a local shrine nearby. However, while using his smartphone to take a picture of himself next to the shrine&#039;s divine mirror, he finds himself mysteriously transported to another world called Yggdrasil.<br />
<br />
This new world he arrives in is heavily steeped in Norse mythology. He also finds that many people fight each other over land domination. Yuuto is later taken in by the so-called Wolf Clan, a group of people with weak military tactics. Using the knowledge of military tactics he gained from school and his smartphone, he gradually makes the Wolf Clan rise to prominence. <br />
<br />
In turn, he also gains the affection of a group of magic-wielding warrior maidens known as the Einherjar.<br />
I am just going to say this right now the story is a complete dumpster fire.<br />
Right out the gate, this show makes a horrendous first impression where the show starts off with our protagonist already in the fantasy world for two years. We the viewer barely know jack shit about protagonist time from the last 2 years minus that terrible backstory that shows us how he got transported in the word.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Master Of Rock Bottom is a horrendously written harem disguised as Iseaki anime that follows every single generic story elements that we all seen before from this genre. male protagonist gets send to the generic fantasy land by accident. A bunch of girls from all types of fetishes and tropes come up to surround the main protagonist cock forming a harem in the process. The main protagonist becomes the strongest person in a set country by dethroning every single competent faction with no issues whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if you have seen In Another World With My Smartphone as well any other bad Isekai anime then you seen The Master Of Rock Bottom because not only it took everything that was wrong about those bad Isekai anime but this show somehow manages to make they worse to a point where it actually becomes downright insufferable to watch as you constantly shoving its true intentions right down our throats.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s honestly hard to call the characters in The Master of Rock Bottom actual characters because every single and I mean every single character are a bunch of trophy pandering husks as they all only exist to please a certain type of audience not much beyond that.<br />
<br />
Our main protagonist Yuuto is a generic and uninspired husk who barely has the capable of being an actual protagonist. His motivation is paper fin as we know jack shit about his earth life and his personality as an interesting as a potato.<br />
The female characters aka Yuuto fetish harem are somehow even worse. Every single female character in this show only has a single character trait and not much beyond that.<br />
The same thing can apply for side characters and villains.<br />
<br />
Saying that The Master Of Rock Bottom looks like garbage is a fast understatement. This is by far the absolute worst looking show I have ever experience from this decade. Black Clover, Beatless and The King&#039;s Game my have horrible production values but least tired to good every now and then this rabbit hole show doesn&#039;t even give a damm about looking good. <br />
<br />
The character designs all atrocious bad as all ugly to look at as they every single character look like they came from DeviantArt in the year 2001. Not to mention all of the female characters are oversexualized to the core meaning throughout this show you will see lolis doing sexual acts left and right.<br />
The actual animation is hot garbage. Choppy movement left and right, horrendous fight choreography, abysmal use of CGI for the horses and soldiers. Budget cuts everywhere mixed with the shameful use of stock footage.<br />
<br />
Now if you the show actual animation was horrendous the opening visuals are somehow even worse. It&#039;s is a normally for the anime industry to have opening visuals that look good in order to draw the viewer in but The Master of Rock Bottom can&#039;t even do that. <br />
<br />
Not only do the characters in the opening visuals constantly go off model but the way that the show was directed visually gives me an eyesore. The camerawork is almost as bad as Bubsy 3D on the PlayStation 1 and the way that the show showcased fight scenes in the opening was pure nonsense. How can a hammer red dude be able to move with the hammer like a freaking sword?<br />
<br />
 I understand that training exists but at the same time but how can he be able to block fast sword attacks from that sword chick. In both real life and video games heavy weapons while despite being doing more damage to the foe has a pretty long reaction time cool time thanks to that weight of the hammer facing towards a certain leaving you wide open in the process for enemy fire while you&#039;re trying to control the weight of the set heavy weapon.<br />
<br />
To add insult to injury in episode 11 the red dude is was able to spin the heavyweight hammer like a shield without getting tried. That&#039;s not how hammers work...<br />
<br />
Just like with most bad Isekai anime that came before it, it&#039;s generic and boring Isekai music that we all see before. The same thing applies to both the opening and ending themes which they are uninspired as hell that is filled with crappy imagery.<br />
While the soundtrack is generic the sound effects are downright horrible as they sound they just came straight from Berserk 2016. <br />
Now we get to the best part of the more like the final nail of the coffin being the voice acting for both the sub and dub.<br />
<br />
The sub version is filled with boring and shitty performances where it feels like they are reading the show&#039;s script.]<br />
<br />
I honestly feel bad for the Seiyuus who had to voice characters in this scrapheap of an anime. Now if you thought the sub version was bad the dub version is somehow even worse. Not only the audio quality was abysmal beyond belief but the every single voice actor in the show sound like they were they were doing a hentai production something. Jesus Christ <br />
<br />
<br />
This anime is a prime example of why I hate Isekai anime so much. It is a giant eyesore that makes Darling in the Franxx and The Asterisk Wars look like they were done by Hideaki Anno. The story, characters, voice acting, music, and the production values are absolutely horrendous beyond belief.<br />
<br />
In my review of How to Not Summon a Demon Lord, I mentioned that I hated the Isekai genre as a whole and that show made hate despise the Isekai genre even more. Now after watching this rabbit hole of a show I officially lost all respect for Isekai genre as a whole to a point where I never want to touch an another modern Iseaki anime again.<br />
<br />
Screw this show and screw everything that this anime stands for.<br />

    I just made an account for the sole purpose of giving this show a fair, non-pretentious review. I&#039;m hoping it will help give people a reason to not skip out on this show. I know it&#039;s easy to be put off by all the negative reviews, but let me be the one to tell you that they mean nothing. They aren&#039;t trustworthy professionals that know the ins and outs of storytelling and writing. They&#039;re delusional trolls who only THINK that they know what they&#039;re talking about. They don&#039;t. They&#039;re victim to the primitive belief that if you don&#039;t understand something, that makes it bad. I&#039;ve

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315228">
        actually made attempts to learn how authorship works. Writing is complex and often difficult, so there are thousands of different styles to go about it. And knowing that, I look and this show and say with the utmost confidence, it&#039;s fucking great.<br />
<br />
I love this show to death. I will admit that I&#039;ve always liked history, it was my favorite subject in school. Seeing as this is a historical fantasy, there is a little bias. But there&#039;s much more to the show than its setting. Its characters are memorable and its story is very smart. Everything is written with emotion, which is a staple in isekai. People complain about how everything feels rushed, but here&#039;s the thing. This is a seasonal anime. It was made for the purpose of promoting the light novels and manga. They were given a certain amount of material to cover, and the studio just had to roll with it. Not to mention said studio is rather small and has less than 20 employees. This is why the animation has some cut corners. Being understaffed and on a tight deadline will do that. However, this isn&#039;t a constant issue. It&#039;s only noticeable during the more action-oriented scenes. Everything else looks fantastic. The art style is beautiful, very smooth and colorful. Even the not-so-good parts were given impressive handiwork to not stick out so much. There were scenes of armies battling, and you could tell they were CGI. But unlike most 3D models that are put in 2D anime, it blended in rather well. Scenes like that happened in a bird&#039;s eye view, so it had a certain flow that made it work. And for the parts where there were still-images and basic motion effects, it was a little off. But it made me remember old low budget animes like Pokémon, which kinda made me feel kind of nostalgic. It definitely could&#039;ve been worse, so it&#039;s only fair to appreciate what they did right. The same goes for its storytelling and pacing. The people complaining don&#039;t understand the method the author is using. In a story like this, build-up and development is unnecessary to progress the plot. What happened before the present isn&#039;t as important because that isn&#039;t the focus. What&#039;s currently happening is what&#039;s important. Backstory is provided when necessary, and questions about the characters and what lead up to the current events is answered through flashbacks. This is called retrospective development. It&#039;s different from traditional writing, but does the job all the same. The show has a story to tell, and it tells that story with no time wasted. This works pretty damn well for a show that deals with a big world with a lot happening, but only has less than 6 hours of it to show. When a story is so character driven, it only makes sense to spend time SHOWING you the various personalities, rather than explaining the whys and hows. I don&#039;t care about stuff like when/where they were born, favorite food/color, or any pointless detail. I care about their relationships and impact on the story. Personalities, designs, those are what to look for in a character. And believe me, this show nails that. So with that said, let&#039;s get into everything that makes this show great and why I loved it so much.<br />
<br />
The characters are a huge staple. Whether it&#039;s on the battlefield or in the bathhouse, there&#039;s so much charisma and charm in how the characters are written. The girls are all in a harem over the protagonist, Yuto. This makes sense, because it&#039;s through his actions and knowledge that lead to the prosperity of his fellow clan. Not only this, but he&#039;s just a guy who&#039;s easy to like. Very kind, but stoic when necessary. Not afraid to express himself, and most importantly, faithful. Even with a harem that&#039;s throwing themselves at him, he never forgets the person he actually loves, Mitsuki. This leads to a lot of funny moments with the cast. Various members of the harem try to seduce him, putting him in awkward situations that he gets flustered at. But when he comes out of those situations with his resolve in tact, you can&#039;t help but admire the hell out of him. I&#039;ve seen people hate on Mitsuki, saying she&#039;s boring and doesn&#039;t do anything, somehow disregarding that she&#039;s in a completely different world from the cast. They say Yuto is dumb for being loyal to someone like her, which only proves that they&#039;re completely missing the point. Yuto has known Mitsuki since childhood, so he knows her the most out of anyone in the cast. She&#039;s proven to be a lot like him, seeing how kind and caring she acts towards others, especially him. Even while being separated between worlds, there wasn&#039;t a day that went by where she didn&#039;t think about him. She was constantly looking for answers about his situation and talked to him whenever they could. When on the phone with him, she always expressed her worry for his health and safety, and lamented that there wasn&#039;t anything else she could do. Someone as dedicated as her can hardly be called &quot;boring.&quot; Yuto has a harem of women that have special powers and quirky personalities. Compared to them, Mitsuki is just a normal, ordinary girl. But in a world so crazy and different from home, that&#039;s exactly what Yuto wants. He needs a familiar face in his life, someone he knows and loves. And who better than the one person from home he misses the most? The writing can be subtle, but beautiful. And as I said before, it&#039;s very smart too. Yuto&#039;s clever and crafty nature did wonders for the story. His writing is what made a lot of the show interesting, especially the battles. It was really cool to see him use actual military strategies used by real historical figures and generals. This ranged from using the Greek phalanx to just getting close to the action and providing his troops with morale. This was all because he had his smartphone. Something like this is a small writing detail, but it goes a long way in the story, which I appreciate.<br />
<br />
Overall, I just love how creative the story is. The use of Norse mythology and ancient tradition is a nice touch, it works really well given the setting. But above everything else, my absolute favorite part of this show is the ending. It was just really sweet and wholesome. Everyone is happy and ready for what comes next. And honestly, it had me smiling so hard I probably looked crazy. Depending on how long the story goes, I&#039;d like to see how far along the society gets in its time period. I&#039;m really hoping for a season 2, but in the meantime, I started reading the manga too. I&#039;m not a big novel reader, so hopefully either one gets more material soon. In the end, everyone just needs to sit down and give this show a good watch. I guarantee you won&#039;t regret it if you let yourselves see the positives. Everyone behind this anime worked really hard to give us entertainment, so we should be grateful rather than shit on it. I hope I was able to change some minds, and I hope you all have a great day.

    Well everyone seems to hate this anime but all in all it&#039;s not that bad.<br />
 It has a good protagonist that is not overpowered but actually puts effort in accomplishing things  , good enough art work and it is not based on a game fantasy world like Sword Art Online, Overlord and frankly about a million others!!<br />
 I don&#039;t have anything against those, in truth I find them quite enjoyable but it is good to have something different once in a while. So to tell the truth I do not understand what everybody has against this anime. <br />
 The ending feels very rushed though.

    I&#039;m putting about as much effort in this review as was put into the anime.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
<br />
- OP isn&#039;t Slide Ride. <br />
- Smartphone usage is much better than in Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni<br />
- Basic attempt at introducing battle tactics.<br />
- MC actually has a goal beyond just fucking around. <br />
- Ucchi OP <br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
<br />
- The development of the phalanx is wrongly attributed to Alexander the Great and Oda Nobunaga (??????)<br />
- Most of the female cast are the MC&#039;s adopted sisters. Naturally, all of them want to bang him. <br />
- Awkward CG<br />
- Tactics only work because everyone else is brain dead. <br />
- &quot;Oni-sama&quot; is abused to a much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285315">
        greater degree than Mahouka. <br />
- Based on Norse Mythology my ass. <br />
- The katana being the most powerful sword in the world. <br />
- One-dimensional characters. <br />
- Stilted animation and direction. <br />
- Poorly defined world. <br />
- MC just happens to be the most compassionate, smart and charismatic guy around.

This anime has got to be one of my favourites, from the character development to the story. It&#039;s simply a masterpiece. The animation is also very well done. I would say they could easily compete with ufotable and kyoto animation which are some of the top studios right now. The sound quality was also very good.<br />

    Something I always thought of when watching isekai anime or reading isekai manga was &quot;what about the original world?&quot; In most if not all isekais, the series doesn&#039;t bother with the world whence the protagonist came, and neither does the main character, because he or she just died to get to the new world. So, I always thought: &quot;what if the protagonist actually has contact with his original world and/or can travel back and forth between the two worlds?&quot;<br />
<br />
Now take that, mix it with Norse mythology and flush it down the filthiest toilet you can imagine.<br />
<br />
Hyakuren no Haou to Seiyaku no Valkyria (big words, long

          <span style="display: none;" id="review347959">
        title, must be an isekai!) takes a premise that is relatively unexplored in isekai and ensures that no author will want to tackle it ever again.<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY: 1<br />
The story starts two years AFTER the protagonist has been summoned to another world. In other words, his presence is already well-established, and we&#039;re actually watching a season 2 rather than a season 1. Other than that it doesn&#039;t try anything unique outside of its premise, it&#039;s just &quot;MC gets into situations where he trumps the opposition, both in war and love&quot;, and in the laziest fashion possible, since he has his cheat! (Which is his smartphone. Sound familiar?) Isekai isn&#039;t exactly a genre known for their thought out stories, but this? I could probably write something better up. Definitely not an anime for story buffs. There really isn&#039;t much to say, it&#039;s just downright awful.<br />
<br />
ART: 2<br />
The art style is incredibly plain. Absolutely nothing about it stands out apart from how old it seems. That art style would&#039;ve been a standard in the 2000s, not in the year of 2018! Thick lines in the animation, which could&#039;ve been remedied if it wasn&#039;t done in such a haphazard way, the incredibly poor CGI that they tried to blend in with the scenes but failed to mask (which makes it that much more attention-grabbing, in a negative way) as well as the poor animation in general. (Even in the opening and the ending! That&#039;s where you at least try your very best!) At least the colors were somewhat vibrant in terms of the characters, if there&#039;s anything to compliment.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 2<br />
To put it as kindly as I can, it&#039;s very telling that this anime adaptation doesn&#039;t come from a well-established studio. The voice actors do not do their albeit one-note characters justice, and while they do fit their characters, their execution is something to dread. It&#039;s like they&#039;re trying to drive the point that &quot;THIS is an onee-san kind of character, and THIS is the typical tsundere&quot;  while they&#039;re giving us subpar delivery. As for the music, the OP sounds like they stacked a bunch of dramatic effects from each instrument and filled the song to the brim with it that it doesn&#039;t feel special at all. Eventually all you notice is how nasal the singing is, which makes it sound like chalkboard scratching to your ears. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 1<br />
Clichés after clichés after clichés. There&#039;s nothing wrong with clichés, and I usually enjoy most of them in isekais as my standards is generally pretty low, but holy fuck, this was unbearable. They are about as basic as you can get: the typical well-liked protagonist who is plain in every way, shape or form in terms of our standards, the variety of girls so that &quot;there&#039;s at least one girl that you&#039;ll really like!&quot;, varying from the strong girl, to the onee-san, the tsundere, the kinda himedere, the airhead, the cunning, and the list goes on and on. Of course, they&#039;re all horny for the protag, so they lust after him even though he has expressed multiple times that he doesn&#039;t want that kind of a relationship with any of them. And the villains don&#039;t get much better. The &quot;main&quot; villain has reasoning behind his actions that are very stupid, truth be told, even from a &quot;high on pride&quot;-type of perspective. There&#039;s someone who seems to be in the shadows, orchestrating everything, but it never gets properly developed on either. Of course, there&#039;s also a battle-hungry moron of a villain who just happens to be ridiculously strong. And somehow, he&#039;s the most likeable character. <br />
(Also towards the end of the show, the MC gets this weird obsessive episode which is really creepy and/or incel-like. Really struck a chord in the worst way possible.)<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 1<br />
After episode 1, I knew that I was in on one of the worst rides I&#039;ll ever have been on. That feeling never washed away, and as each episode progressed, I just wanted to get this show over with. &quot;But I can&#039;t drop the show, that&#039;s basically admitting defeat!, I thought, while continuing and losing brain cells. Am I proud of myself for finishing this show? Yes! And no. Yes because I didn&#039;t lose, I beat the hideous monster that was this show! No because I actually convinced myself that this was worth my time when it in all respects definitely wasn&#039;t. I ended up blasting &quot;YOU ARE MY FRIEND&quot; through the entirety of episode 12 just to get it all over with, and I&#039;m thankful I did. I would&#039;ve snapped otherwise.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 1<br />
Hyakuren no Haou to Seiyaku no Valkyria is now one of (I think) three animes that I hate the most and therefore gave a 1. Do I know which one of the three I hate the most? No. And this anime surely didn&#039;t help when there was only the two of them. An absolute waste of time in every sense. I feel bad for everyone who sat through all 12 episodes, whether they liked it or hated it (like I did), I feel bad for the voice actors and actresses who lent their voices, I feel bad for the animators wasting away unpaid overtime hours over this, and I feel bad for everyone else involved. This should have never come to be, and I doubt I&#039;m the only one feeling that way. I thought that since I like trashy isekais ridden with clichés I&#039;d find some smidgeon of enjoyment in this, but evidently I didn&#039;t, and neither will you. Steer clear of this heap of garbage of a show.

    I&#039;m lazy so I&#039;m going to use google translator:<br />
<br />
Okay, the anime has 2 scenes of echhi for 1 action, but I really like anime that portrays historical facts.<br />
The anime has its cons yes! But he managed to hold me back only with the strategies used in battle, drawing a lot from Norse and Roman mythology. He relied on great historical leaders, and his thoughts on dealing with opponents made me see until the end.<br />
Of course, the anime could be 10x more elaborate, the battles are fast and the duels even more, which is a pity, since the anime had potential for epic scenes. But it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341205">
        looks like they didn&#039;t want to focus on that ...<br />
<br />
Anyway, it ended up being a slice of life with escapes for quick battles. I don&#039;t know if I would recommend it to someone who doesn&#039;t have the same taste as me.

    You would think the show would start off from showing how the protagonist works up his way to gain a harem. At least a mediocre harem anime. But no, they went even further, they went beyond the scope of a mediocre harem anime , they went to deepest part of the dumpster and stayed there.<br />
<br />
You would expect it be like Date a Live! at least, but no, dude starts out with op characters. aka, LEGENDARYS, LVL 12 SYNCHRO SUMMONS, GOD DAMN ADD IN EXODIA EQUIPPED WITH THANOS GLOVE TOO BC WHY NOT, is basically how the creators made this anime. <br />
<br />
In all. It just sucks.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285015">
        The main character started off way too op. <br />
The anime is even milking the smartphone thing. Only redeeming thing about the anime is the mild good waifus. Not on the level with Rem or Zero Two, but at least they got buubs and bootys.

    I’m not the one to read through reviews or write my own for that matter, but the overall score seemed strange for this anime. Of the Isekai genre this is one of my favorite main characters, Due to the incredibly low score I couldn’t find the anime. Yuto is an enjoyable character to watch. The use of battle strategies and not being overpowered only made me enjoy the show more. He also has a brain and actually talks through things with the girls rather than just turning red and not saying anything like many shows. The smart phone usage was also a great add. There’s

    “I don’t think there’s a isekai worst than Sword Art Online”<br />
<br />
Writer of MORBE: Hold my beer! <br />
<br />
I’m happy to announce to everyone who thought SAO was the worst isekai ever, that The Master of Ragnarok &amp; Blesser of Einherjar (MORBE) has claimed that title. I have full confidence in saying that The Master of Ragnarok &amp; Blesser of Einherjar is the worst isekai of all time. If someone made a list of everything wrong with a isekai light novel translated to an anime adaption then this would tick every box, that’s how laughably bad it is. <br />
<br />
Story- (1/10):<br />
 This anime is very unique in its premise. Usually

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287644">
        it starts with the protagonist getting inexplicably transported to a fantasy world, but this doesn’t even bother to start with that because who wants to see that again, amirte?! Your next thoughts are probably “we’ll get a proper introduction later on”, but NOPE it  doesn’t go back to explain it either!<br />
When we’re introduced to the protagonist, he’s already been in this world for two years, so it’s like this doesn&#039;t classify as an Isekai.<br />
<br />
There’s a ton of questions we’ll likely never know the answer to, for example:<br />
- How the protagonist got transported to this world <br />
- What are the rules and intricacies that governs this world e.g. Why are their different clans? what they fighting for?<br />
What’s more hilarious is the first episode attempts to cover this through exposition to explain how our protagonist got to his position of power, but it doesn’t explain shit. It just glosses over all the information and important details  <br />
<br />
What a masterful deconstruction of an isekai anime! It has to be that or lazy writing which is why the story is so shallow and generic.<br />
Seriously, the plot goes nowhere. The protagonist’s goal is to get back to his time period, but not really since he’s done nothing towards this <br />
<br />
Characters- (1/10):<br />
Our protagonist is named Yuuto: a dense, self- insert harem protagonist who’s perfect in every way! He’s handsome, the leader of the Wolf Clan, adored by his devoted subjects, a military genius, the most morally just, and more importantly he has a harem of bitches at his beck and call! What more can you ask for in a MC?!<br />
<br />
Honestly, Yuuto’s incredibly bland and severely lacking in character traits that i can’t even fathom why these girls swoon over him. They try to mention Yuuto’s flaw of being overconfident in the past which is why he’s frustrated and calls the red haired musclehead general a ‘baka’ all the time, but here’s the best part- we never see it! We never see Yuuto’s first experience coming into this world so we don’t know how naive and reckless he was or how he overcame it and become the humble beam of perfection we’ve come to know.   <br />
<br />
So what makes Yuuto standout from your usual self-insert harem/Isekai protagonist? Well, Yuuto is unique in the stance that he claims girls as his property, and forces them to bend the knee to be part of his “family.” Yes, this sick perverted bastard makes these poor girls his sisters and daughters, and has them address him as “big brother” and “papa” to fulfill his incestial fantasies.<br />
<br />
What else makes Yuuto great? Well he has a smartphone, but not just any ordinary one- a solar powered smartphone! Now our protagonist can search the web to look up military tactics from great historical leaders on Wikipedia to implement their strategies in battles, create advanced war technology and improve his clan with future inventions/concepts e.g. schools for education. <br />
<br />
Seriously, I don’t rate Yuuto at all because he isn’t exactly intelligent or strong, just a ordinary teenager with a deus ex machina smartphone. There’s nothing compelling about his character. At least Yuuto acknowledges he’s cheating and completely ordinary without it.<br />
<br />
Let’s move on to the girls now. They are all so one dimensional, uninteresting, bland and can be described in a single sentence:<br />
<br />
Felicia: Yuuto’s right hand girl (i’m shocked how I remember her name). Why does she have this role? I couldn’t tell you. She isn’t exactly intelligent or strong, just diplomatic and good at organising I guess. <br />
<br />
The other girls include: <br />
Pink haired horn clan imouto<br />
Assassin Twins: one being a airhead and the other being a smartass<br />
Grey haired, devoted swordsman girl  <br />
Slave child girl who calls Yuuto “papa”<br />
Tomboy blacksmith girl  <br />
<br />
That’s literally all there is to them. <br />
<br />
Oh, let’s not forget Yuuto’s girl back home who isn’t actually his gf, but the childhood friend he loves and wants to return to. It’s such a poetic tale of how Yuuto has a harem of girls on his dick, but yet he’s still dreaming and fantasising about his unreachable girl that he’ll probably never see again xD<br />
<br />
Another character is Felicia‘s brother. He’s a butthurt teen because their father picked Yuuto over him as his successor to the wolf clan, so he leaves to join another clan to seek revenge. He’s depicted as someone to rival Yuuto, but truly he stood no change against our lord and saviour! Felicia loves her “brother” Yuuto more than her real brother. Why does Felicia have such devotion to Yuuto over her real brother? No real reason. We don’t get to see how their relationship progressed and got so close.<br />
<br />
Seriously, can someone break Yuuto’s smartphone already? I’m tired of seeing his irrelevant 5 min conversations every episode with the girl he likes. The conversations are always meaningless shit like a summary of how Yuuto’s day went. Mitsuki is so one dimensional it hurts. She has no depth, no screentime or relevancy to the actual story, so every time they talk I lose any immersion i have in this world. We don’t even see Yuuto and the girl’s relationship before he got transported into this world, hence why it’s so shallow and underdeveloped that I can’t be invested in them whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Animation- (1/10):<br />
The animation’s trash. The CGI during fight scenes doesn’t even look like fights since the characters don’t even look like they’re hitting each other. There’s a lot of terribly animated still frames too. The battlefields, soldiers uniform and battle strategies aren’t detailed enough, there’s not enough focus on the troops to make it feel like they are at war. Plus, you can’t tell what strategies are being used properly due to the animation.<br />
<br />
Sound- (1/10):<br />
I can’t even remember the osts because I was too entranced in watching this masterpiece. Seriously, the OP, osts and endings are forgettable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- (1/10):<br />
I must be a masochist for pain because I hate this show with a burning passion, and regret every minute I spent watching this anime.  <br />
<br />
Overall- (1/10);<br />
The plot has gone nowhere thus far, the characters are painfully bland and annoying, we can’t get a semblance of plot progression without there being eechi fanservice scenes every 5 mins with girls pressing their boobs on Yuuto or literally taking off all their clothes and throwing themselves at him (I kid you not, this actually happened). I forced myself to watch this hoping for one redeemable quality, but I got nothing. The only reason I could recommend watching this is for the sole purpose of fapping to some soft incest hentai, or you’re watching to find out why it’s so bad and received negative reviews. Either way, it’s really not worth it.<br />
<br />
PS: Can anyone point me towards where I can watch the prequel? Because it’s as if we’re missing a season’s worth of source material on Yuuto’s life with his childhood friend, the introduction of when he was transported into this world and his rise to power as the Wolf Clan’s leader in those 2 years. This anime had a couple of cool ideas e.g. the setting, the different clans etc, but the lack of content and poor execution destroyed any semblance of potential this might have had.

    I thnik this is one of the best isekai/harem anime. i love an idea with strategic clashes of ancient troops. i want to see next season! i dont know why some peolpe hate this, maybe they&#039;ve seen too much. I Love reference to Nordic ancient Mitology. I personally hope season 2 will actually show up, I can&#039;t wait for the main character to return to secound world.at many points I was stressed and anxious about the course of events. I was very hooked by history. if you like harem and elements of strategic combat in which the leaders are powerful this anime is for you.

    Dreadful....<br />
<br />
Absolutely dreadful<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not sure where to even begin...I&#039;m someone who loves this genre...I&#039;ll go as far as to even enjoy the isekai smart phone anime even if it&#039;s to just laugh at how terrible it is. But this anime is different.<br />
<br />
Firstly we start off when the mc on the battle field. How did he get there? Idk. Why was he there? Idk. Unlike most isekais this anime starts off with the mc already in a different world. We have no idea how he got there, why he was there or why the mc is at the position that he is currently in(the anime tries to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285014">
        explain it later on but does a poor job at it...)<br />
<br />
I&#039;d write more about this but I&#039;d be wasting my time. I&#039;ll just give you my advice...dont waste your time....trust me it&#039;s not worth it. The fan service is alright for the series but like there are other anime that have better fan service. You shouldnt waste your time with something like this. The anime will bore you to death plus the world build is horrible. What makes isekai anime entertaining is the fact that we can see the world in the eyes of a character who is foreign to the world. Without proper world building no matter how many lolis and &quot;oppai&quot; you put into the series it will suck...and not in a good way. I cant even cringe watch this show smh...

    This anime has been on my radar mostly because I kept coming back to the page to read the funny reviews about how bad it is, and I finally decided to watch it and write my own review.<br />
<br />
This anime is bad. I think I have pretty low standards when it comes to anime, my average rating for all the anime I&#039;ve logged on this website is an 8/10, but even after seeing the score for this and reading a lot of the reviews, this anime managed to limbo below my already low expectations, and then kick me in the shins for expecting more from it.<br />
<br />
A

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285081">
        normal plot follows the path of exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, then resolution. The episodes don&#039;t follow this at all. Just considering the first episode, the plot went from climax to exposition to falling action then to rising action. It also doesn&#039;t help that the action scenes are tepid at best, and feel very short and rushed considering how major the consequences of the battles are supposed to be.<br />
<br />
All the main characters the same generic anime faces, and the characters are so flat (with the exception of their tits) that hentai characters have more depth, and at least with hentai you&#039;d see people fuck instead of this where the mc is one of those people who are probably afraid of kissing.<br />
<br />
The second episode mentions that this is taking place two years after the mc came to this world, which to me just seems like an excuse so the writers don&#039;t have to write the probably more interesting story of what happened when he first landed in this world and why the girls already by his side like him. Probably because they can&#039;t think of a reason why the girls like him.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever watched an anime where I&#039;ve yelled &#039;what the fuck&#039; and &#039;what is this shit&#039; more times than this one.<br />
<br />
Now that I think about it, the four sentence synopsis on this website explains more of the backstory than the first few episodes of the anime, and if I haven&#039;t read it then I would be completely lost.<br />
<br />
I almost wish that this anime was worse than it is, because at least then it&#039;d be so bad it&#039;s entertaining, like The Room, but no, this is just plain bad. Hell, if you&#039;re at least semi-amused from reading this then this review is more entertaining than the anime.<br />
<br />
Characters are bland, story is okay but poorly executed, art is generic, skip this anime.

    WHAT THE HECK!! I&#039;m done... I tried watching this anime without reading the SYNOPSIS because I thought I don&#039;t need it, because I&#039;ll know it in the anime later. The RESULT is... I almost dropped halfway in the episode 1 because there is no introduction AT ALL and I have no idea what&#039;s happening. I don&#039;t even recognize this is an isekai anime even until  the later episode.. I only give 4 stars because of their hard work to make this anime!! Otherwise it will be only 2 stars. The only thing that&#039;s good here is the character design but the story stupid -_-..

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327592">
        So I wouldn&#039;t recommend this anime to anyone because it is really boring. They wasted money on this anime because this anime is not original, bad character grow and some cliches. I really hope this studio will fix their mistake so it&#039;ll not repeat next time.
