    Candy Boy is a sweet, good natured slice of life romantic comedy.  Right off the bat you should understand that this series revolves around yuri love and an incestuous relationship between fraternal twins.  Even saying this though, there is really nothing to be offended about in regards to this series.  While normally my creep-o-meter would be signaling its alarm bells, I actually really enjoyed Candy Boy.<br />
<br />
The plot in Candy Boy is uncomplicated and revolves around twin sisters Kanade and Yukino and their high school life together.  Unlike a lot of slice of life series, Candy Boy&#039;s episodes feel like they are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16489">
        all part of one large movie sized one as events flow seamlessly from each episode.  Both sisters struggle to find time for each other and both get into college.  Little happens in terms of dramatic romance, while there are very tender moments, those hoping for mushy love scenes and romantic kisses will likely be very disappointed.  There doesn’t seem to be much in the way of social consequences from either classmates or family due to the sisters’ quite obvious relationship.  In a way this is both disappointing and a relief.  Though I thought it was the right choice because, for me, it kept my attention off of the creepy aspects of the show.<br />
<br />
The characters are excellent in the series.  This is helped by the fact that the cast is extremely small and focuses exclusively on only four characters.  In fact I can really only remember a couple instances where people other than those four even spoke any dialogue.  This was an excellent decision since the series is already short and doesn’t have time to build much depth in the characters.  The sisters Kana, Yuki, and to some extent their younger sister Shi get the majority of the attention.  Kana is the most interesting of the group and feels the most complete as a character.  Most of the story elements flow through her and what she is thinking and feeling.  You get a good feel for all of their personalities and their motivations, though it does feel like of the twins, Yuki gets a bit of the shaft in terms of depth.  Sakuya is the comic relief and while she is in love with Kanade, she is never a serious love interest.  There really isn’t any angst in terms of relationships which I found a bit refreshing.  Kanade and Yukino love each other deeply and basically nothing can separate them.<br />
<br />
The art and animation is truly fabulous.  I loved the character designs and the settings and backgrounds were all wonderfully dawn and animated.  There did seem to be a bit of inconsistency though, even though it was great looking sometimes characters didn’t always look the same throughout the show.  The acting was very good and it featured a number of good musical pieces.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed Candy Boy quite a lot. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of yuri or just wants to see a sweet slice of life series and is not bothered by the subject matter.  While it may be a bit controversial to some audiences, I think it will appeal to most people.<br />

Candy Boy is the sweet little story of two sisters living together in a dormitory and their usual lifestyle. But this slice of life anime comes with a twist: the two are romantically affected to each other. Although yuri incest is wincest, the fact stands that there are some that may be offended from the shoujo-ai and/or incest. If this combination works for you, then you&#039;ll have no problems enjoying this anime as much as I did.<br />
<br />
As with many other anime in the slice of life genre, the story is given to us at the beginning of the anime, but not much of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14954">
        change happens. Surely our yuri twins get closer and closer to each other in every single episode, and the romance aspect IS developed throughout the anime. We have a sweet relationship to begin with, and only a few possible characters that can affect the story one way or other. The whole imouto-san business, the twins&#039; college entrance and dorm changing may be of interest to some, but keeping your expectations high in the story and expecting anything ground-breaking wouldn&#039;t be wise. That said, from the occasional change of moods and places, this straightforward story successfully gives what it promises.<br />
<br />
As you go along the series, you will most probably find out that it contains many &quot;still-pictures&quot; that tend to be overly long and drawn out, but not that annoying; not since the art was never meant to be over the top. The character designs are cute enough to make the viewer like them instantenously. The clothes worn in the anime, which tend to bring up the &quot;cute&quot; aspect of the characters, may sometimes be fanservicey, but are presented as no big deal without much emphasis on them. Zettai Ryouiki fans will be delighted to see Yuki&#039;s knee-high socks completed with her mandatory skirt, much to our enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Yet another area that a slice of life anime usually fails in is the BGM. Pretty much non-existant, or rather, unimportant is the BGM in slice of life anime, yet we would all be able to understand that something is wrong if BGM simply wasn&#039;t in the show or if it did not fit the mood at any given time. This can be compensated by the seiyuu, who play a big role in any speech-based anime, Candy Boy being one of those. None of the voices of any character is annoying or leaves us with a bored face for any reason whatsoever. A new sense of realizm was reached in the last episode as everybody started talking together about totally different things at the same time; a situation any viewer should be able to relate to.<br />
<br />
Let me get this one thing straight; there are no boys in Candy Boy. None. If you can ever find one, please tell it to me so that I can start worshipping you. That said, do we even need boys in this anime? The two main characters, Kanade and Yukino, and the two supporting characters, Sakuya and Shizuku are interesting enough to fill out the whole anime. Although they are twins, Yuki fills in as the little sister with childish attitude role, and Kana acts more like a mature, older sister. Sakuya is there for the occasional comic relief that we all need sometimes, offered with her yuri tendancies for Kana. The imouto Shi-chan allows more of a story to develop, and is a blend between Yuki&#039;s cuteness and Kana&#039;s looks and personality. None of them being dull or plain annoying is yet another blessing.<br />
<br />
The caution from before still holds true at this point; if you don&#039;t like yuri/shoujo-ai, then this series is not for you. I, as an avid fan of female relationships, knew fully well that I was going to enjoy this anime as much as I expected. The interactions between the twins are cute, and usually funny; those two adjectives are enough for me to be sold to an anime. The fact that Candy Boy isn&#039;t a straightforward ecchi/yuri but rather a cute love story only makes things better. As long as you have that bittersweet feeling of having completed the series after you&#039;re done with Candy Boy, then all is fine.<br />
<br />
Candy Boy did (damn, where is my italics?) leave me with that bittersweet feeling of both accomplishment and sadness. There is not a single thing in the world that is perfect. As a rose comes with its thorns, Candy Boy may be coming with less-than-stellar story and easily-forgettable BGM, but that does not change the fact that we still like both of them.

    Candy☆Boy is a series that&#039;ll induce an &amp;quot;aww&amp;quot; feeling, given you accept two main premises-- one, it&#039;s f/f (shoujo ai).  (Please refer to the warning spoiler below for the second premise.)  It started off as a seven-minute ONA but I guess it fared well enough since we&#039;ve got more episodes coming, now each being fourteen minutes long to boot.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Before we get into the review, I&#039;d like to mention a major warning (that is fundamentally SPOILERish):  This series has incestual vibes between fraternal twin sisters.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
The additional episodes don&#039;t seem to push the sisterly relations between the two protagonists as much with the shift

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4831">
        from calling Yukino &amp;quot;Yuki-nee&amp;quot; (in the ONA) to &amp;quot;Yuki-chan&amp;quot;, but even with episode one you can see that the fluffy overtone is a clear continuation of the ONA.<br />
<br />
Candy☆Boy is one of those series that rolls slice of life, comedy, and romance all into one, so plot is most likely going to be rather incidental.  The art is a lot more detailed and the animation much smoother in the additional episodes compared to the ONA, while the seiyuu continue to deliver a solid performance.  (You may recognise Sakuya&#039;s seiyuu as Katou Emiri, of Lucky☆Star fame as Kagami.)<br />
<br />
The comedic moments are well-timed, and serve to enhance the series overall without taking the limelight away from the relationship dynamics.<br />
<br />
Of course, it&#039;s still too early to say much in terms of character development at this time and there are many other points that haven&#039;t been expounded on yet, so I will update this when we are privy to more episodes.  <br />
<br />
I do think the series is coming along nicely, however, as the motivations of certain characters weren&#039;t made too clear in the ONA.<br />
<br />
Updates*:<br />
<br />
Episode two brings more of the same defining characteristics of Candy☆Boy that makes it so lovable-- cute interactions between Kana and Yuki, with Sakuya keeping things light-hearted.  A shot or two reminiscient of fanservice cropped up, so that might be this series&#039; attempt to draw (and maintain) the attention of its targeted demographic audience. <br />
<br />
*Will be integrated into the rest of the review at a later date when generalisations are possible.

    I&#039;ve only ever watched two Yuri animes - Strawberry Panic and this being the second. However, I&#039;ve also watched quite a lot of romance animes and I can say with confidence that this one blows everything else out of the water when it comes to realism. <br />
<br />
It is exactly as the synopsis says, twin sisters are in love with each other - it is an incestual relationship... but hang on is it? This is the real kicker. Their relationship is more like platonic love on steroids. If you&#039;re hoping for some Yuri action, passionate kissing etc. then you can forget all about that because these

          <span style="display: none;" id="review96181">
        sisters are so sweet and innocent that they could possibly melt boulders and cause volcanic eruptions. They hold hands all the time, stare into each other, talk about their feet and stuff like that. After a few episodes, rainbows will randomly start to appear in your room, you will begin to fart out leprechauns and have visions of a galloping unicorn. Seriously though, this series is very innocent and the sisters never do anything sexual. The only way we can tell for sure that they&#039;re in love is through their dialogue, which is so sweet that I nearly came down with a bad case of diabetes. However, all of that made the series more believable and if there ever were twin sisters in love somewhere out there in the real world... they&#039;d probably behave like this. <br />
<br />
As for the characters in this show, there are only four. Kanade &amp; Yukino (twin sisters), Shizuku and Sakuya. Shizuku is the younger sister of Kanade &amp; Yukino while Sakuya is there to provide comic relief and nonchalantly hit on Kanade. These four characters will interact with each other on a regular basis and further reinforce the already impregnable relationship between Kanade and Yukino. All other characters in this series are only there to fill in empty spaces; they don&#039;t posses names and are mostly mute. However that is a brilliant move on the part of the makers as this is a very short anime and focusing on the main cast provides the viewer with a consistent experience. <br />
<br />
The art here is truly amazing. I don&#039;t like using the word &#039;amazing&#039; because it is quite possibly the most overused word in the English language. However, when it comes to this series I can use it with honesty. The animation is staggering. The twins are flawless in their design and whenever they hold hands you can see that it&#039;s the work of professional and talented artists. If you&#039;re reading this guys, well done. I nearly had a stroke the first time I saw them holding hands.<br />
<br />
The sound is also very good. The soundtrack fits in with the series, the ending is heartwarming and the voice acting... oh boy. I&#039;m a rookie when it comes to Japanese. I can count and only say a few words without sounding like an idiot but even I can tell that the voice actresses did a good job here. It is authentic to the core. In all the animes I&#039;ve watched I&#039;d say this anime here has got the best voice actresses.<br />
<br />
All in all, a very good anime. Relaxing, stress relieving. An innocent tale of two girls in love. I&#039;ve never imagined that Yuri could be this entertaining. I admit I must have had the wrong impression of it. Or perhaps it&#039;s just this particular anime that&#039;s so soothing and enjoyable. Well either way, I&#039;d recommend this to anyone who likes romance. A must-watch.

    Why do people like the anime? It baffles me. I picked up this anime because it was on the recommendations page for an anime I liked, so I had high hopes. Those high hopes were destroyed pretty swiftly.<br />
<br />
---Character---<br />
  I am talking about character first because it is the biggest thing that bugged me about this series. Right away, I felt something wrong with this anime. At first I couldn&#039;t put my finger on it, but then I realized it was because the characters are flat as paper. Sure, they were animated pretty decently, but that doesn&#039;t matter when there is nothing memorable about any

          <span style="display: none;" id="review60949">
        of them. They all seemed fairly genetic. Not to mention that their sister (Shi-chan) was kind of annoying.<br />
<br />
---Story---<br />
  I know that this was a fairly short series, so it didn&#039;t have time to develop a whole lot, but there was no trace of an actual story. Now, this normally wouldn&#039;t bug me, since I love pointless animes (Azumanga Daioh, etc), but the happenings of this anime were just awful. It says that the twins are in love, but are they? It seems like a fairly normal sister relationship, except for a few aspects. Their so called relationship doesn&#039;t go anywhere. I&#039;m pretty sure normal sisters tell each other they love one another, so that&#039;s not anything special. Don&#039;t misunderstand me, though. It&#039;s not like I was in it just for yuri action and am upset because I didn&#039;t get to see any; I generally wanted their relationship to advance.<br />
<br />
---Art---<br />
  This was the only thing about this anime that I enjoyed. The animation was done well. As I mentioned before, the characters were designed well, plus the scenery and background images were decent too. Not much else to comment on.<br />
<br />
---Sound---<br />
  Same as art, not much to comment about. It wasn&#039;t awful though, that is for sure.<br />
<br />
---Enjoyment---<br />
  This anime left a bad taste in my mouth. I&#039;m not sure if I don&#039;t appreciate it because I&#039;ve never watched a shoujo-ai anime before, but either way I didn&#039;t like it. Maybe if I rewatched this anime at a later date I would appreciate it for what it is, but as of right now I stand by my overall score. I really wanted to like this anime too, but no matter how hard I tried I couldn&#039;t get myself to enjoy it. <br />
<br />
---Overall---<br />
  Overall I give this anime a 4/10. I&#039;m probably just being a prude, so the majority of you reading this will probably enjoy this anime.

    TLDR at the bottom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like you all the time since I was born.<br />
For a long time...<br />
and we stay together, forever...&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy Boy is something of a pleasant surprise. Intoxicated by exterior titles, I came into this series thinking none other than typical yuri. How wrong was I indeed, for Candy Boy doesn&#039;t follow such blasphemy, as instead, it is of an innocent bloom in this bizarre bouquet dubbed romance (specifically girls&#039; love/yuri).<br />
<br />
The premise of Candy Boy is simple, it follows two sisters and life. Really, that is all the anime spares. I suppose I could touch on the lifestyle these characters take as well, there is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415674">
        a lot of referring to family relationships and concreting the ties that behold the two parties. Candy Boy also makes use of &quot;generic&quot; s.o.l moments to hold together a sense of reality, instead of a singularity on solely the main point of the narrative. I&#039;ve said time and time again how much I love simple anime, I have to say Candy Boy really takes the cake here. Sure, the entire anime is probably nothing new in the medium, but with writing that endeavours in its ecstasy without notice. I find it that Candy Boy is not only lucid but a fully elaborate story on its own euphoria. I&#039;m not one to find the most pleasure out of stories like such, with its themes of sister love, there wasn&#039;t really much to submerge myself into with this. However, the execution came in and absolutely hammered everything that an anime as such should have, I don&#039;t really have experience with the genre either, but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if this was entirely believable too. It&#039;s strange but not surprising, just another impulse of irrationally that, yet again, has proven misleading in analysis. Efficient thinking has its disbenefits, I&#039;d tell all.<br />
<br />
As for the characters, I liked each and every one of them. Both lead characters, Kanade and Yukino have really good chemistry and a sense of humanity to them, they felt like normal humans and behaved accordingly, I suppose with lack of episodes, there was no room for major development, however, that is completely fine, as the characters remained intact to their fixed settings. It may sound boring, but it is a perfect fit for such an anime. Sakuya acted as the clown of the show, diverting moments into comedic relief so that the anime wasn&#039;t entirely monochromatic. I do believe she did a fine job at such, conveying such a personality throughout the show as one would expect without any hinders. The same goes for Shizuku and her gimmick, which was bringing drama around more often than not. The drama here is a hit or miss, but overall it didn&#039;t crash the quality of the show despite it being of &quot;generic&quot; order, which I will stress once more, is totally fine in an anime as such. So overall, they are relatively great characters.<br />
<br />
The audiovisuals for its time is incredible, the background was seriously well made, the designs were fresh and polished, all the other words reviewers will use to say something is great. I suppose with this being an OVA, AIC (whoever they are) had the benefits in the market, if I am not wrong, they probably could have gone wild with aesthetics and made it even more beautiful, but seriously, for the late 00s, this is amazing stuff. The same is true with the OST and voicing, more so OST in the form of OPs and EDs, sometimes this stuff sounds like something out of KEY or something. Whilst I would like to praise the in episode OST, I simply could not remember everything that played, however, if I tried, I do believe such quality could also be found throughout. I wouldn&#039;t have guessed such amazing production values would be brought into some original OVA no one really speaks of, which goes to show that expecting the unexpected brings pleasant surprises.<br />
<br />
When all is said and done, I really did enjoy Candy Boy a lot more than I thought I would have originally. All the lucidity, the bliss, the other big words I need to find via googling synonyms, is nothing short of impeccable. So, as said for about the 111th now, the simple stuff is good stuff, and that happened to be Candy Boy, which I enjoyed a lot. I would imagine if you are looking for a deep and intrinsic story, you won&#039;t find one here, if you are looking for something not &quot;s.o.l boring&quot;, you won&#039;t find it here. Full enjoyment usually comes around to those with low expectations in an anime like this, with satisfaction levels disproportionally magnified whenever said artistic piece achieves the basics of whatever it tries to accomplish.<br />
<br />
<br />
TLDR: Candy Boy achieves apex status in its elegant writing of a simple tale of two sisters and the life events that arise around them. Great characters that fit together live hand and gloves. Amazing production values for its time, also check out the full OP/EDs<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall - 8.8 (9)<br />
<br />
----------<br />
I planned to watch this specifically in a time where I&#039;d binge multiple romance anime, for some odd reason, I just didn&#039;t with this anime, same with School Days, same with Citrus… anyway, I wholeheartedly recommend this OVA to anyone interested in some niche title or is a hardcore fan of romance, you just don&#039;t want to miss this presentation if you are like me who is satisfied by anything wholesome. On that note, I&#039;d also recommend reading &quot;Tamen De Gushi&quot; if you can, it&#039;s more of a feeling that vibe recommendation rather than it bonds well on an internal level, both have girls&#039; love though. Otherwise, I have nothing to leave off with, I will say, however, don&#039;t look at this anime&#039;s cover and jump to vapid conclusions; a treat lies ahead, maybe it will taste like candy. You tell me.

    I like yuri. Rather, I like lesbians. Alot. And these lesbians are a welcome addition to the admittedly small genre of yuri anime. And yes; I said lesbians. With a name like Candy Boy, this title exudes almost pure DO NOT WANT vibes, what an absolutely terrible name for such a series. They could have at least called it Candy Girls, or Girls Like Candy, or Candy Lesbians. Or better yet, YEAH MAN, LESBIANS MAN! in big blue letters. I&#039;m series; It took not one, but four recommendations for me to check this out because the name is so misleading that I felt I was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16737">
        going to fall pray to the old &quot;watch Bible Black, feels good man&quot; trick. Luckily such was not the case. Candy Boy is, to clarify, actually made of 50% lesbians and 50% MORE lesbians. To get this out of the way fast, Yuki and Kana are related. Very related. Not that fake hentai related, actually biologically related. It&#039;s blatant incest, so if that bugs you, steer clear. But, personally, I don&#039;t give a damn. I think it&#039;s awesome, because they are attractive and fictional.<br />
<br />
Story; 8. It&#039;s fairly episodic, and at seven minutes an episode this is neither surprising nor bad. If you&#039;ve seen a slice of life, you know what will happen; just on a much smaller scope. Picture the storyline of a single episode of Azumanga Daioh (If everyone including the gym teacher were lesbians) spanning an entire series; That&#039;s Candy Boy. And it works, more or less. The only plot point that failed hard for me was the little sister; Hell the what now? Get off my screen, annoying not-as-hot-as-your-incestuous-sisters loli. Go hang out with those mindless girls from K-On! or something.<br />
<br />
Art; 8. Let&#039;s be honest here; people who watch yuri, at least to some reasonable extent, want to look at attractive girls that love other girls. How very unsurprising. That said, even series as stellar as Simoun can fall short as a yuri series by having poor or unfitting artwork. Even Strawberry Panic, the only other &quot;pure&quot; (absolutely 0% of weenie at any given time) yuri series, fell here on a number of occasions. That said, this is actually Candy Boy&#039;s biggest success point. Kana and Yuki are well drawn, and shockingly identifiable in the vast sea of doe-eyed, smiling anime girls that exist today. Kana has a very neat haircut, as well as two cool cartilage piercings. Yuki often wears suspenders that are left hanging, and just generally layers clothes to create a very &quot;realistic&quot; or &quot;modern&quot; stylistic look. I know this sounds silly, but these cartoon girls really are quite stylish; and when a large factor of your genre is how adorable your protagonists are, this counts quite a bit. Rest assured, the art is good, especially for the girls (and nothing else really matters anyways, stop pretending).<br />
<br />
Sound; 8. There was one theme I could type all the do-do-dum&#039;s to and hope one reader (if there ever is a reader even) gets it but I&#039;ll spare you; Suffice to say, the music here was elevator-esque anime music, no doubt, but a couple of the themes were catchy enough to stick with you till you heard an actual song. And none of them reeked of casio keyboard basement nonsense; Boring and unsurprising themes? Yes, but at least they sound like someone with good technology made them.<br />
<br />
Character; 8. Personally, I see a lot of fans who like Yuki over Kana, and perhaps I&#039;m just not looking that hard (scratch that-I&#039;m not looking at all. I&#039;ve just happened to notice) but I really liked Kana. I&#039;m sure half of it was that she, like myself is a struggling arts student dealing with poor lodgings and aggravating professors. But even aside of that, Kana had more of a mystique about her; Yuki was just cute. In a full series run however, I can very easily see Kana being more emotionally interesting. Her character model also appealed to me more, although I enjoyed both, and as aesthetic and small as it is, the cartilage piercings and quasi-hime cut as well as the darker skin really did it for me. She&#039;s probably the most attractive (I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m typing this, but then again, being a user on MAL already shoots my cool factor straight to hell) anime female that I can think of. The only stupid charcter is their little sister. Hot lesbian twincest, hot lesbian stalker, more hot lesbian twincest, little sister feelings and drama,....Wait. What? She greatly interrupted my enjoyment of something I don&#039;t always get to enjoy with my anime; girls with boobs, and as a character was made of I-don&#039;t-care-bitch and TOWERING depression. The stalker was awesome though, in case I didn&#039;t underline that previously. Three feet tall but still not lolicon? That&#039;s a welcome first. Sign me up.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall; 8. It&#039;s length makes Candy Boy very, very rewatchable. Every now and then if I just want to watch something quick and nice, or whenever I just want to replay the scene of Kana and Yuki sharing cake over and over and over (every single day, amirite?), the length is actually a very nice change of pace from the standard 12 to 26 episode series. As stated many times before, when I watch a purely yuri series about girls that love girls, I want to see pretty much nothing focused on but that; Hot girls frolicking about my screen with other hot girls, only to be interrupted by other hot girls stalking them. And Candy Boy delivers in spades; Or should I say, lacking all humor, class and wit, IN LESBIANS. And in incest. But that&#039;s only wrong when it isn&#039;t two hot sisters anyways.

    A sweet, incestually implied, slice of life with two twin sisters. It delivers exactly what it promises.<br />
<br />
-Minor Spoilers-<br />
<br />
Story (7)-<br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t much of a story really. Just the life of these two sisters- Yukino and Kanade- and the challenges or events they go through. The rough plot seems to be the twins’ feelings for each other although if it hadn&#039;t been listed as yuri and incest I doubt anyone would be able to tell when watching the first couple of episodes. Saying that however, what I really liked about this anime was the gradual development that is put so subtly it makes it seem life-like and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14286">
        therefore grants the anime with a somewhat messy but passable story line.<br />
<br />
Art (8)-<br />
<br />
It has very cute and appropriate animation that fits the story well. I don’t have any complaints about the character designs although sometimes the boobs seem to have grown considerable amounts one episode then revert the next. Overall it’s nicely done.<br />
<br />
Sound (6)-<br />
<br />
All the voice actors did incredible jobs for their characters with none of them sounding whiny or annoying. However the background music is unremarkable (so unremarkable I’m having trouble remembering it...) All in all it does what it’s suppose to and remains fitting for whatever certain scene.<br />
<br />
Character (8)-<br />
<br />
This is a great part of the anime with all the characters being likeable and funny without seeming too unreal.  Kana and Yuki’s relationship is a big influence on their personalities and it’s amusing to watch how their own personalities change around each other (let’s not forget to mention it’s also adorable). The supporting characters such as Shi and Sakuya are also pleasant to watch and add their own emotions to the anime. This show has a good variety of cute, realistic characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9)-<br />
<br />
I enjoyed this anime a lot and didn’t feel my eyes wandering or staring at the clock like they do most animes. The somewhat subtle fan-service and sweet interactions between characters keep me entertained through each episode.<br />
<br />
Overall (8)-<br />
<br />
Candy☆Boy is a cheerful anime focusing on the sweet relationship of two sisters who obviously care deeply for me other. I like how this show blows of all gimmicks and clichés to display a range of pure and honest characters that can make you smile. A great show, I strongly recommend it to you.<br />

    In many ways this is a subdued yet sweet story of two sisters’ nourishing their budding romance. It never turns explicit, but instead moves slowly through everyday moments. It is easy to sense that the sisters relationship is a true progression built top of many years which allows their interactions to feel natural. Best of all is their banter, which is highly enjoyable, and feels like two siblings reminiscing and having fun together. <br />

Like some slice of life shows Candy Boy meanders, but in a good way. The characters are school girls and so the story follows the trials and tribulations of their simple daily

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180026">
        lives. There isn’t really much drama to speak of and it’s all about the fluff. The love that the two share is never clearly defined. It is suggested to be romantic in nature but the two rarely do anything of that nature when they are alone. If anything they just seem a little closer than “normal” sisters: they hold hands and flirt with each other. Their relationship is all about living in the present; they wish to stay together for the foreseeable future but they never worry about the small things. It’s light hearted and sweetly innocent. <br />
<br />
Being so brief, you can watch it quickly; however the show easily touches the heart. It fleshes out the lives of the sisters, and is about the small moments in a relationship such as sharing an umbrella, shopping for a Christmas presents, etc. which is part of what makes it so charming. The characters don’t make grand overtures, rather they illustrate their love in small and tender ways.<br />
<br />
One sister, Kanade, is a bit shy (she’s a little bit of a tsundere) but you can sense her affection for her sister. The other one, Yuki, is the complete opposite. She’s cheerful, spirited and outgoing. The other character is the stalker underclassman, Sakuya, who provides the comic relief of the series. Her amusing fangirl ways add some spice and vary the tone.  <br />
<br />
The animation looks dated but it has a certain nostalgic air. The colors are muted but cheerful and the characters are well designed. The characters eyes in particular are well detailed and convey more than what the characters say along with the movements of their bodies. Their faces always are exceptionally expressive and the backgrounds can be dazzling with natural scenery. It’s almost as if the whole show is in love like the main characters. <br />
<br />
The music is... Not the best. To be blunt it sounds like upbeat elevator music. The ending song is an outdated 90&#039;s pop ballad that seems overly saccharine for how restrained the series is. <br />
<br />
In closing, all I can say is that I really think everyone should give this series a try. While it may not be to everyone&#039;s tastes, with the way the series deftly handles everything, most should find little objection to it. It treats these two like a normal couple who are easily empathetic and lovely. Their love isn’t a flashy love, rather it is quiet, sweet and simple, and all the better for it. <br />

    Candy Boy is an anime that puts an emphasis on the whole genre of yuri. It is about a very innocent love and how it has no boundaries (probably the most cliche line ever)  and how it plays out makes for a short but delightful to watch anime, especially for those into yuri and romance.<br />
<br />
Rather then reviewing episode 00 and EX01-02, I figured I&#039;d review it as a whole. As the synopsis implies, this IS about twin sisters in love and just about nothing else. <br />
<br />
In these 10 short ONA&#039;s, there isn&#039;t much of a story to build on but rather its a episodic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22928">
        adventure into the lives of twin sisters living in Tokyo and their daily activities. <br />
<br />
To begin, the flow of this brief series is slow and subtle and most likely leave u with a &quot;cute and fuzzy&quot; feeling at the end of each and every episode. The story may lack a bit of realism, but who cares. Innocent love lacks realism at this day and age. Sure there may be no significant story, but it would be quite improbable to have a good in-depth story with short episodes.<br />
<br />
In the end what Candy Boy lacks for story, makes up for in terms of lovable characters, their adorable personalities, and overall enjoyment you will get out of watching them.<br />
<br />

    i liked the characters, <br />
i enjoyed watching this anime because of them.<br />
but the relationship between the sisters is.. kind of unreal.<br />
(from personal experience)<br />
i love the thought of admiring your sister though, <br />
instead of gettting annoyed at her (which is more realistic) lol <br />
i loved watching this though, i though it was great,<br />
its reallly cute

    This anime was too short and that is the only thing that makes my rating drop.<br />
I really did enjoy the flow of the events and the back stories, and such.<br />
 It kind of blew my mind.... yes yes, incest... I like the way they portray it in here: not all that tortured, sort of in between the lines... <br />
<br />
I think this is another case of &quot;Pocky Shoujo ai&quot;... (I claim the term)... a reference to Ga Rei Zero.. a sweet kiss, so what? I guess it is only the creator who know the true meaning, and speculation is left for the rest of us mortals...<br />
<br />
I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17183">
        think the relationship was really interesting. Was it sexual love? Was it familial love? Was it platonic love? It made me think a lot what  truly defines the relationship between humans and what we need from each other. (In fact I just watched this anime after reading &quot;The God of Small Things&quot; by Arundarthi Roy... so it got me by the rational and dramatic side.<br />
<br />
I like the little sister, her conflicts, the whole moving from the country side to the city aspect of it...<br />
<br />
All in all, it is was a great late night watch... and it is totally worth re watching and discussing. <br />

    Initially I thought that this anime was horrible but I had to change my mind. The story in general is very well managed and the characters are very interesting to follow. I could call it one of those few yuri that is worth seeing (as opposed to Citrus).<br />
The romantic element of the story is very well managed and is not trivialized at all, in fact, I was almost surprised by the management of some scenes. However we are not talking about a perfect anime, obviously, it tends to be boring in some scenes but nothing serious. Personally I found the comic element of some scenes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314859">
        annoying, which seemed to me to be slightly forced. Kanade Sakurai is the one I prefer most among the twins, maybe because I find the character more interesting. But these are just personal tastes.<br />
I was surprised that the relationship between the two remains platonic. For some it could be a minus point but I prefer something simple rather than scenes full of ecchi but without romantic content.<br />
I recommend it for those looking for a shojo-ai story that is not complicated to follow and does not leave a bad taste in the mouth.

    The Anime is really to the watcher&#039;s preferences, i see this show as a Slice of life more than a Romance.<br />
<br />
An enjoyable thing about this anime is really the main characters,<br />
Kanade and Yukino. Its as the Title implies &quot;the Certain Twin Sisters in Daily Life&quot; if you see this as a Romance and expect Romance in this anime you&#039;ll probably just be bored out of your mind, Try seeing this as A Slice of Life instead you&#039;ll enjoy how the show portrays the Twin sisters,<br />
and the the ending will be worth waiting for as you will finally see the scene that you are Craving.

    This is a short tale of twin sisters who are quite obviously in love with each other, that’s right not like &quot;love each other&quot; but rather &quot;in love with each other&quot; hopefully you get the difference here otherwise the entire point of this anime will be lost on you. they have a little stalker fan girl who wants the one but they dont care and are always back in bed with each other at the end of the day. <br />
Heres how this was pitched to me: a yuri romance involving twins. this is something which inspired perverse thoughts upon me in almost record setting time

          <span style="display: none;" id="review98059">
        and now i feel terrible for that having now seen the entire thing. These girls just want to be together for the rest of their lives and damn it all if theyre siblings and it would count as incest(or in this unique case, &quot;twincest&quot;) they just want to be together which in my book counts as the fucking definition of romance! some people are probably all like &quot;oh this cant happen, theyre siblings, twins no less, how can some sick bastard come up with this stuff&quot; well heres my response to that: if you truly love someone from the bottom of your heart, no matter who it is, you should pursue it and damn the consequenses to hell! it seems to me that some of the most forbidden romances (like this: homosexuality, incest, etc.) have the purest intentions and i dont think that anyone should be judged for who they love, and its because of that belief that i was a fan of this anime.

    It&#039;s strange to see such a fanservicey premise of lesbian, incestuous twin sisters develop so tamely, without either fanservice or a dramatic analysis of incestuous love in modern day Japan. Candy Boy is the light-hearted, gentle paced, almost-YA romantic yuri anime you&#039;ve yearned for...but with an abnormally short runtime, a stretched budget and a little bit of incest.<br />
<br />
- Now, I want to make something clear before we go any further. I&#039;m maybe a little bit grossed out by incest. Thinking about it rationally, I shouldn&#039;t be - what you do in your own time is your own business and I shouldn&#039;t judge. But it feels

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231991">
        innate and I can&#039;t much help it. However, Candy Boy succeeded in never making me feel disgust; if anything, I was rooting for their relationship more than I ever expected. I can&#039;t guarantee you will feel the same, but I wouldn&#039;t put this show to bed because of that little caveat. -<br />
<br />
Candy Boy follows the art-college-life of twin sisters Kana and Yuki as they struggle with college costs and, more importantly, finding the time to be with each other. It&#039;s a rare thing, seeing a romantic story choose to develop post-honeymoon stage romance, but Candy Boy takes that challenge and is very much successful. Since they&#039;ve always been together and their relationship has probably never had a honeymoon stage, it&#039;s bizarre yet enticing watching them try and inject the fun, the romance back into their... love life? <br />
<br />
Believe me, some of the scenarios are a little cliche for the genre, but I never found myself rolling my eyes. Some of the short episodes focus on walking home in the rain under a shared umbrella, shopping for Valentine&#039;s presents for each other independently and going on a surprising date. However, the core of what makes Candy Boy so charming is the light tempo, the episodic pacing which ties together to form something bigger and the depth to which it discusses it&#039;s small cast of characters and their feelings and ambitions.<br />
<br />
Kana is the younger, but in many ways more mature and practical twin. Somewhat of a protagonist, her feelings are the ones we see most of and we realise how much she cares for her lover/sister and wants to spend time with her, but is trying to balance that on top of college work and struggling to cope. <br />
<br />
Yuki, the older twin, can surprise with moments of maturity but is generally impulsive and more emotional. We generally follow around Kana, but tend to realise that Yuki is feeling the same way at the end of the episodes. It appears the Yuki has less workload, but we realise how dependent Kana is on her, even if Kana doesn&#039;t want to admit it.<br />
<br />
Sakuya is somewhat the friend&#039;s twin, and tends to function as a comic relief character. Seemingly infinitely wealthy, Sakuya harbours strong romantic feelings for Kana but is never in competition with Yuki - she knows she has already lost that battle. Sakuya is surprisingly helpful to our characters when she&#039;s not being creepy.<br />
<br />
The fourth character is introduced in the midseries arc, where the sisters go home to see their family. Unfortunately, their parents can&#039;t make it so it is just their younger sister at home waiting for them. Despite her incredible maturity that exceeds her age (and probably the main characters!), she is struggling to understand what a correct sisterly bond is, compounded by how extreme her older sister&#039;s shared bond is. This is the only time that the taboo topic of incest is actually covered, and it&#039;s sweet and gentle to see the twin&#039;s caring deeply for their sister, and learning to care more.<br />
<br />
The most important part of the series comes at the end, where Kana must make the decision of going to Summer School to prepare for a fancy prep school - thus leaving Yuki behind - or choosing a less prestigious art school and staying with Yuki. Across the last episodes, Yuki gets a part-time job to help pay for Kana&#039;s Summer School and Kana feels guilty. It feels like all of the work done to get their love-life back on track disappears. <br />
<br />
However, Yuki makes it clear that no matter what, they will always be together. Even if they don&#039;t spend as much time together or see each other every day, they will be together no matter what. They admit they love each other - romantically speaking - in a few quiet, but ordinary moments with a slow, gentle kiss in a small shelter on a snowy day. While their love may not be spread across multiple universes and timelines like a couple of the more epic yuiri romances, it is something eternal. And yet, it&#039;s beautifully human.<br />

    This review will contain my opinion and that alone. As such it will be a most unformal, oral and not very informative review, as far as these things go. And keep in mind that your opinion and enjoyment will most likely differ from mine, if it doesn&#039;t then I&#039;d like to talk to you cause you seem like my kind of person. Also remember that this is the internet, the wonderful land where something is either terrific or terrible, there is rarely  room for any grey zone. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m just going to go right ahead and say that this anime is not one you should

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173503">
        spend your time on, unless you&#039;re adicted to yuri and have scraped the bottom of the yuri genre, and even then I&#039;m reluctant to recommend this as what you get is merely teasing of this incestuous relationship between these two sisters, and little else. <br />
<br />
Yes this is an incestuous yuri lovestory, is that wrong? No, absolutetly not, I&#039;m all for both the yuri- and the yaoi genre, does that mean all yuri and yaoi is good out of the premiss of being yuri/yaoi? No offcourse not, it still needs an interesting plot and strong characters, like most romance shows need. I feel this is an issue with most of these kinds of shows, with a possible exeption from my own anime history being &quot;No. 6&quot;. But I&#039;m sorry, I digress. <br />
<br />
All but one of the characters seemed, to me, uninterested in making you the viewer like  the show. They&#039;re just sort of going along with everything that happens (which is quite little, but I&#039;ll get back to that later) the exeption of this is Sakuya, who&#039;s trying to lift the show up with an element of humor and her wacky shenanigans. To me she was the one positive point to this otherwise downright boring anime, and even she came out too strong at times making me hate her character for being the shugar-rushed masochist that she came of as in these moments. Our main characters however are the two sisters Yukino and Kanade. Kanade seemed so indifferent to what was happening in the world around her and opposite to her sister did not have a funny, mischeavous side. Yukino, while having her own charm would from time to time play along to Sakuyas shenanigans, both too Sakuyas benefit and dispair, making her an amusing character in the end, and you know that Kanade cares about her sister too giving her character some redemption too.<br />
<br />
The show was quite frankly about nothing. Nothing substational happens. I guess there is that minor subplot about their sister, but I don&#039;t really feel like that went anywhere. You&#039;d have conversations not going anywhere for a couple of minutes, then Sakuya would appear, with the same yoke over and over again getting rejected, crying, and then stand ready for her next moment to make a fool out of her self, and then the show would end with the sisters having another empty converation.<br />
<br />
The art and sound were both quite boring. The show didn&#039;t have an opening something that was sort of disappointing to me, and the people, not only in the background did not move at all, making it  look like they were statues rather than actuall human beings, The show is not even that old, so I think they should have done a better job with these, since this made the world feel less alive.<br />
<br />
Believe it or not I actually went into this anime with an open mind. I&#039;m no stranger to wierd romance situations in anime, and the phrase &quot;show about nothing&quot; had me intrigued as I am a pretty rapid Seinfeld fan. I also took heart by the fact that the episodes were so short and few, a selling point for me, even though I know those shows tend to be short for a reason. In the end, however, I was dissapointed. <br />
I suppose the relationship between the sisters is a sweet one, and their bond together is truly unseperable. And it really shows through their actions (Or lack there of). But the relationship between two rather empty characters is not enough to make a whole 7 episodes shine, when all other points of the show feel so poor.

    This anime to me was amazing. The characters looked good and the art was good like basically everything was good was what I thought when I watched it. When I watched the first episode my heart was hurting since I felt jealous of how close the two sisters could be. They would hold hands every dang second, outside and inside and even sleeping.<br />
<br />
 As the anime went on I still really enjoyed it. I felt the pain the third sister was feeling and I could totally understood being left out. I almost even cried. They showed the emotions really well. Every now and then they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review105019">
        have comedy going on.<br />
<br />
If you like or want to watch something really sweet once in a while or if you like yuri then I would definitely recommend this one. It doesn&#039;t even matter if you like yuri, if you just like romance and those kind of anime I would still recommend this since this anime was so sweet. It got me smiling like a big fool when watching it. I wished they would&#039;ve made it longer than those 7 episodes and 1 OVA for me to be jealous.

    Let me just say straight off the bat that Candy Boy is about yuri love between two fraternal twins. At first, many people may be turned down by just seeing that it&#039;s incest or yuri but I have to admit that this is a very innocent and sweet anime. It&#039;s quite short too so it shouldn&#039;t take up much of your time, in fact, I finished it in 1 sitting just now from 1am to 4am since majority of the episodes are only 10-20 minutes long and there&#039;s only 8+2 episodes.<br />
<br />
There really isn&#039;t any negatives to this anime. There were parts that were either positive

          <span style="display: none;" id="review45237">
        or remained neutral. Nothing really got me to say I disliked it. The story was very sweet in that it shows two sisters in love with each other. It&#039;s absolutely innocent and there&#039;s nothing dirty or perverted in this anime compared to other anime that contains incest. Not only is the love between these two twins sweet but the love they have for the little sister back home really warms up your soul. The characters were developed quite well as many of the questions I had were answered and it did not leave the viewer feeling empty. The anime also included a comedic relief in the form of a freshman girl and I find the comedy to be just right. It was neither too funny to ruin the touching mood nor was it too lame to really kill anything. It was also interesting to me to find out that the voice of the freshman girl was the voice of kyubey from Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Unfortunately, one thing I did dislike was that the episodes and the anime overall was much too short. I&#039;m a slide-of-life, school life anime type of guy and I really wanted to know more about the future of these girls. I would have at least wanted to watch the anime till their graduation but at least the way the creators ended the anime left a warm, fuzzy feeling in me after watching it. Overall, I give it an 8 out of 10 because it was very innocent and sweet. Those are probably the two words I would use to describe this anime...innocent and sweet. Since the anime is short, I would not mind rewatching it as it did make me smile and for some reason, kind of provided a nostalgic feeling probably due to the countless moments one of the sisters reminisced about their past.
