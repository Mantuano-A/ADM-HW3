3D Kanojo: Real Girl is a painful experience. A lazily shat out rom-com that uses cliches and plot contrivances as a crutch to hobble its way through twelve agonizing episodes. Proudly it presents insultingly stereotypical characters that are anything but three-dimensional.  <br />

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281648">
        this glorious shitfest and it becomes abundantly clear what the show’s main issue is: it’s fucking hideous. The art is a disaster; backgrounds are a mess of fuzzy colors, there’s very little animation, and in an attempt to stay on model the characters hardly change their expressions. All the show has going for its visuals are the character designs, and even those are just the same faces mediocrely drawn and in worsening quality as the show progresses. <br />
<br />
The love interest, Iroha, has one expression for the majority of the show, pouty sad girl, the main character Tsutsui is more expressive which also means more frequently off-model. From time to time you’ll see characters slide across the frame on motion tweens with no animation whatsoever, making it seem like they go to a school for ghosts. And that&#039;s the closest the show came to making me laugh. Stiff character animation is partly to blame for the lazy comedy, but also the directing is so slowly paced that even if the dialogue was good (which it isn’t) there wouldn’t be much to enjoy. Awkward doesn&#039;t even begin to describe how the dialogue feels, it&#039;s clumsy in a way that’s too unnatural to be believable and too poorly timed to hit with any impact. Sharing some of the blame is the monotonous elevator music that adds nothing but a headache to any scene it&#039;s present in. <br />
<br />
The moment the opening song starts playing my brain feels like it&#039;s going to explode. The singer sounds so depressed like he’s about to shoot himself, I instinctively hit the mute button so I don’t have to contemplate the void while watching 3D fucking Kanojo. The rest of the soundtrack gives me the sensation of my brain slowly swelling from the aneurysm the droning music gives me. The same song with only two piano keys is looped ad nauseam during dramatic scenes. It slowly puts more pressure on my skull until I relieve it by turning the volume off. Do you like the sound of printers on repeat? Well, check out the sick beats on these action scenes because these swooshes and boops will knock your socks off. This exceeds all bounds of low budgeting, it’s just plain and simply lazily made. <br />
<br />
3D Kanojo falls flat on its face as a comedy, but there’s still room for resonant drama (spoiler alert it’s a cringy disaster too). A story about two emotionally damaged people sorting through their feelings together is an alluring premise, and with a better writer, it could have been good. It’s not fundamentally flawed, it’s just terribly executed. The characterization relies heavily on cliches, and the character-driven story uses only contrivances to progress. Rarely does character development feel deserved; the story is divided by misunderstandings, a third party drives a rift in the lead pairing, then the conflict is resolved by the end of the chapter rinse and repeat. 3D Kanojo is barely competent because it relies heavily on this formulaic cheap method of telling its story. Even so, a character-driven story is only as good as its characters allow it, but they&#039;re trash too.   <br />
<br />
Tsutsui begins the show as the standard archetypal boy who hates real girls because people look down on him for liking anime… That’s not much of a motivation, but the series had room to flesh him out more. And nothing came from it; he remains a mostly oblivious idiot for the entire series. His only ‘character development’ comes from cheap contrivances that lead him into trouble with his girlfriend then eventually the issues resolve themselves. Instead of subverting the mountain of stereotypes it chooses the cheapest route and gratifies his misogyny by making all of the girls comically cruel to Tsutsui, with the supporting character Ishino to represent the mob of angry cardboard cutouts. Her only excuse for hanging around Tsutsui and his girlfriend is that she’s his childhood friend, yet it doesn’t seem like she has a good reason to be there at all.<br />
<br />
Ishino constantly verbally and physically abuses Tsutsui, and he lets it happens because he&#039;s a spineless child. Who in their right mind would be friends with this bitch? Ishino is mindlessly in love with the guy who accused Tsutsui of being a pedophile. It&#039;s as if she wanted to spite him. But don’t worry, the asshole she&#039;s in love with said he was sorry. Even though he ruined Tsutsui&#039;s reputation, the asshole is allowed to join their friend group. He even goes on a camping trip with them all. Why can&#039;t he just grow a spine and tell this guy to shove it and get lost? I’m not sure what I was missing here, but how can someone go from trying to ruin a person&#039;s life to best friends in the next goddamn episode? It’s a suitably moronic resolution for that tire fire of an arc.<br />
<br />
Later on in the series, a stereotypical nerdy girl appears to serve as another case of the trope Not Like Other Girls. And of course, she&#039;s not allowed to just be an archetype because whenever Tsutsui sees her he accidentally comes onto her, making her fall in love with him. Tsutsui’s obliviousness defies all logic, no human is this much of a bumbling moron. Sadly this is 3D Kanojo and there is no room for logic with all these cliches stuffed in. Of course, there is a plotline dedicated to this misunderstanding and the rift it causes between Iroha and Tsutsui. Lazily written misunderstandings fuel most (if not all) of the drama in this series. You’ll always know how to easily resolve a situation episodes before the characters do, it&#039;s frustrating and quickly becomes painful to watch unironically.<br />
<br />
Before Tsutsui and Iroha started dating, he sees the Real Girl herself crying alone in public, then proceeds to creepily following her as she runs errands. Eventually, a shop clerk accuses Iroha of stealing, then he takes it as his chance to take off his hood and emerge from the shadows to defend her. Oh, drool… what a hero, this actually impresses her. That’s what their relationship is built on, him being a creepy stalker and she is not like other girls for various shallow reasons. At this point (the first episode) the show has divided itself from reality, the main character is no longer relatable and all of the playing into stereotypes the show has done goes nowhere, there is no subversion. The author of Real Hurl genuinely believes that otakus are creeps and the key to a girl&#039;s heart is stalking her until she likes you back, it’s hilariously stupid and borderline gross. Anyone who has worked in retail can tell you if you ever accuse a customer of stealing you will lose your job. The whole scene is stupidly contrived to justify Tsutsui stalking Iroha moments ago. It’s all so she can say to him “wow you are a nice guy I should date stalkers more often!” This is exactly why 3D Kanojo doesn’t even work as cute passive entertainment! It fails at being both a comedy and a drama and is not even enjoyable as passive entertainment.<br />
<br />
I have enjoyed plenty of cutesy shoujo anime regardless of trashy writing, Kiss Him Not Me was pretty funny despite the stupid fat joke it was predicated on. There is no part of Real Girl that I found remotely cute or appealing. The main relationship is so codependent yet there’s no actual commentary on codependency. Even though she is the title Real Girl, Iroha has literally no agency in the story. Despite being this tough girl archetype she has so little characterization of her own. She’s pulled around in the story, never allowed to guide its direction. And Tsutsui’s isn’t always the one to drag her around. They even throw in the lowest common denominator &quot;not blood-related&quot; brother to tear her and Tsutsui apart in the final misunderstanding-fueled chapter. There was even some 100% necessary incestual rOmAnTic TeNsiON that I can barely recall because at this far into the series my mind was shutting itself down to protect my sanity. <br />
<br />
If you can turn a blind eye to codependency, the main relationship is still disturbing. 3D Kanojo seems content with calling it cute regardless of the creepiness. I had expected at least some discussion about how the main character literally stalks, takes pictures of, and fantasizes about his girlfriend typically while she’s asleep in the same room as him on multiple occasions (the author’s fetish). But no, he’s an otaku so that kind of cute behavior is normal, right?<br />
<br />
NO! This kind of stereotype is so moronic that it’s offensive. I take back what I said earlier, otakus deserve better than this. Watch something, anything else. It’s clear the author of Real Girl has never been close to an otaku. She has no idea what they&#039;re like. She wrote the main character based on a demographic she doesn&#039;t know at all. Tsutsui is an otaku because we’re told he is. He likes some shitty magical girl anime because we’re told it’s good. He&#039;s misogynistic because we’re told so, not for any clear reason. He’s a socially inept dimwit, so the characters have to constantly explain his emotions. Tsutsui is so vacuous that constantly we’re stumbling into these unanswered questions like; Why does he like her? What caused him to hate women? What does he even like about anime?<br />

Score Breakdown:<br />
[Story: 2/10] Contrived and idiotic beyond belief. <br />
[Character: 1/10] Cliched, archetypal, thoroughly unlikeable. <br />
[Art: 2/10] A messy disaster, lacking animation. <br />
[Sound: 3/10] Repetitive and uninspired.  <br />
[Enjoyment: 1/10] Comparable to being lobotomized.<br />

[Overall Score: 2/10]<br />
3D Kanojo is so mind-numbingly stupid it defies universal logic, I can feel my IQ rapidly decreasing even at this moment just for contemplating the hamfisted story. But not only is it intellectually insulting, but it&#039;s also downright offensive to anyone who dares to try and relate to these grotesquely portrayed stereotypical characters. To top it off, the final episode closes on a non-ending halfway into the incest arc with a sequel already in the works. I can hear the mangaka laughing at me all the way from Japan because I hoped I could damn this to the void forever. Well, 3D Kanojo can fucking take the last laugh because I&#039;m sure as hell not going to waste any more brain cells on this nightmare.

    Please note this review is intended for those that have finished watching 3D Kanojo Real Girl and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. <br />

An unlikely romance between an Otaku and a popular but broken girl that awakens their heart to the feelings that they have been hiding from <br />
<br />
<br />
Based off a popular manga of the same name 3D Kanojo real girl better known as Real girl is a romantic comedy anime that gives us the opportunity to look at what will happen if a high school boy shunned by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281627">
        his fellow classmates for being an otaku was to encounter the beautiful but badly reputed troublemaker Iroha and end up receiving a most unexpected answer to a question that he asked merely as a joke. The first episode of the series made quite the impression on me because of its unique premise of paring an otaku with limited social skills with a popular and beautiful girl that would usually be out of his reach and was interesting enough that I kept it on my watch list and I&#039;m glad that I did. <br />
<br />
Taking place in a modern-day Japan the overall story of 3D Kanojo girl follows the life of Hikari Tsutsui a high school student that while kind-hearted and decent is shunned by his fellow classmates for being an otaku and his encounter with the beautiful but ill-reputed high school girl Iroha Igaraishi and the surprising romantic relationship that they both embark on thanks to a daring question and a most unexpected answer. As Hikari and Iroha embark on their most unexpected relationship both must learn to break out of the shells that they have hidden behind all their lives and learn that to find what true love is they must first learn to accept the strengths and flaws of both their personalities and overcome the barriers that isolation in society have created in their lives.  <br />
<br />
Hikari Tsutsui <br />
<br />
Hikari Tsutsui played by new voice actor Teppei Uenishi is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A high school student and an anime and game otaku Hikari is a quiet, cynical and blunt person by nature that while intelligent and responsible is someone that is shunned by his fellow classmates due to his interests. As a result of this, in the beginning, Hikari was an anti-social person that was overly negative and preferred to stay detached from interaction with his fellow classmates with is sole friendship within the class being with his fellow otaku Itou. As a result of being shunned by his fellow classmates, in the beginning, Hikari had a hatred of real-life girls and relationships with them and limited the interactions that he had with them preferring instead the animated ones that he sees in anime and manga. While a kind and considerate person by nature as a result of being shunned by his fellow classmates Hikari, in the beginning, was a low-key person and preferred to remain in the background where he can avoid any trouble that comes his way.  <br />
<br />
As the series goes on Hikari’s personality gradually starts to change as a result of not just meeting Iroha but also many people that he befriends along the way. Though shunning and viewing romantic relationships with real girls as being nothing but trouble as the series progresses this view of Hikari gradually changes. While nervous about romantic relationships but at the same time curious about them Hikari’s desire to understand them was let down by the fact that he had no experience with it and more importantly had trouble reading the atmosphere and understand a girl’s feelings. However, as Hikari interacts more with Iroha instead of retreating back to his world Hikari gradually becomes braver and more willing to bond with and befriend other people that would have been outside his circle of friends at the beginning showing his determination to change himself and match Iroha. In line with Hikari’s new found desire to bond with and befriend others is his new-found interest in knowing the affairs of others especially Iroha and his new friends and try to solve the problems that they are bothered with to the best of his ability. While still nervous to a degree and having trouble putting his thoughts into words Hikari gradually learns how to get on with real people and as their bonds deepen show them the care and kindness that had been hidden behind his walls. While often frustrated by his inability to read the mood and his lack of experience in love Hikari does not let that stop him and tries hard to not just improve his own personality but also learn more about what love is showing how much he values the relationship he has with Iroha and how much he wants to improve as a person so as to match her. As the series goes on and as Hikari’s relationship with Iroha and his friendships with his friends improve it can be seen that while happy that his life is improving Hikari is somewhat constrained with the fear that perhaps one day all of this can change and that one day he might lose everything that he has gained by meeting Iroha and his friends. But until that day comes Hikari will make the best of the situation. <br />
<br />
Iroha Igarashi <br />
<br />
Iroha Igarashi voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yu Serizawa of Twin Stars Exorcist fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A beautiful and popular high school girl that attends the same school as Hikari Iroha is a kind, quiet and polite person by nature that’s also responsible and dutiful. Unlike most girls though Iroha despite having many classmates that want to know her is someone that seemingly prefers the solitude of being alone and as a result, she like Hikari lacks many female friends her age. While a quiet person that tries to stay away from trouble it can be seen however that Iroha is someone that dislikes seeing people get bullied and indeed is someone that respects bravery and determination which is best shown in her first interactions with Hikari. At the beginning of the series, Iroha and Hikari had a very unexpected encounter with one another that would later have much impact on their lives. Unlike the rest of the students that Iroha had met until that point, Hikari was unlike anyone that she had ever met before. While socially awkward in their interactions and having interests in topics that are unknown to her Hikari’s bravery in confessing to her and his determination to stay out of trouble was something that really touched her. While finding Hikari’s interests to be unique Iroha unlike the rest of the student body did not look down on Hikari and instead treated him with due kindness something that puts her in good stead in Hikari’s eyes and contributed greatly to his development as a character. While respecting Hikari’s determination to stay out of trouble it can be seen that Iroha dislikes seeing Hikari and her friends be bullied and will try to find a way to hit back at the bullies to deal with them when she can. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on Iroha’s personality gradually starts to change as she slowly opens up to Hikari and her new-found friends. While a polite, reserved and quiet girl that seems sure of herself on the surface beneath this it can be seen that Iroha actually is a very fragile person at heart. While certainly having more experience than Hikari in matters of love Iroha due to her looks has had to deal with confessions to her on a daily basis which created not just a large amount of stress for her but also an ill-reputed reputation among her schoolmates. As a result, this created within her mind a very negative image of what a proper serious romantic relationship should be like as most people that confessed to her cannot express a reason for why they liked her beyond her looks and thus creating a belief that people only care about her looks and not anything else. As a result of this Iroha while positive and cheerful on the surface is someone that is noted to be very good at creating masks that she wears to hide her true feelings from others something that was necessary in her life until she met Hikari and made new friends. To Iroha while Hikari is unlike any other boy that she has met before they have many issues that they share that enable them to bond easily with one another. The most prominent of these is the isolation that both feel in school and the lack of trust that they have for their fellow classmates due to their past experiences. While both Iroha and Hikari found it very hard to trust each other at first due to Hikari’s kindness to others and Iroha’s struggles to reveal her true feelings as the series goes on and both learn about what true love is this feeling of distrust gradually vanishes as for the first time in her life Iroha is able to place her trust in someone other than herself. While the relationship between Iroha and Hikari may have started off randomly as they interact with each other and learn more about each other Iroha starts to see and understand the true problems in Hikari’s personality but rather ignoring them as most people would start to instead encourage him to be more confident and proactive showing not just her love for him but also in the faith that she has that like her Hikari would be able to overcome the barriers that he has built to protect himself from an unfriendly society. The character of Iroha I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with her gradual awakening of her true self and of finding someone that will appreciate everything that she has and not just her looks being the best aspects of her character. I felt that her seiyuu Yu Serizawa really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Iroha.<br />

In terms of animation, I felt that both the school and the areas that the cast visited during the series were both well designed and animated. The character designs for the cast I felt were also well designed and I also liked the designs of the uniforms that the cast wore as they attended school. The character of Ezomichi which is an anime character from one of Hikari’s favourite shows I felt was interesting as his discussions with it matched well with his desire to find a common ground in society and I felt that her actions in the series which was larger than her role in the manga helped greatly in providing advice to Hikari for the many trials that he had to overcome in the series. In terms of music, I felt that the series OST did a great job of conveying the various moods and feelings that the cast felt as their relationships with each other developed. In particular, I really liked the series opening and ending themes which for the series was Daiji na Koto by Quruli and Hide the Blue by Bish with the former being able to create a sense of calmness while the latter being able to convey a sense of anticipation for the next episode. In terms of voice acting for the series overall, I felt that the series voice cast did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I felt that Teppei Uenishi, Yu Serizawa and Reina Ueda who portrayed the characters of Hikari, Iroha, and Sumie did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. The supporting cast for the series while not featured in this review I felt also did a great job supporting the overall story with Minami Tsuda, Shouta Aoi, Takuma Terashima and Sayaka Kanda doing an excellent job at portraying the characters of Arisa Ishino, Yuto Ito, Mitsuya Takanashi and Ezomichi respectively. <br />
<br />
Overall conclusion <br />
<br />
In overall 3D Kanojo girl was an anime that I really enjoyed watching with its main strengths being its unique premise, strong story, excellent characters, excellent voice acting and its integration of various but related themes into the story. While the premise of having an average guy falling in love with one of the schools most popular girls is itself not unusual within the anime world I felt that the unique premise that the series introduced to the concept made it sound even more interesting than the base concept something that definitely caught my interest. Within Japan, the term Otaku is a derogatory term unique to Japan that is used to label people that have obsessive interests in aspects of Japanese popular culture such as anime and manga. The negative nature that this term conveys means that people often look down on otaku and view them with suspicion and often causing distances to form between them and the person in question. Having the main character as an otaku that falls in love with a girl I felt was an interesting premise exactly because the lack of knowledge on basic human to human interactions is something that’s unknown to most otaku and seeing Hikari not only try to confront this overwhelming wall that stands between him and Iroha but make it work was something that really resonated with me. <br />
<br />
The overall story for the series I felt was one of its main strong points with its focus naturally being the relationship between Hikari and Iroha after their first meeting. True to most otaku Hikari, in the beginning, was someone that adored the world of anime and manga and as a result, bore a distinct dislike of human girls and interactions with humans that don’t share his passion which combined with his lack of social skills made him an outcast within the class that he was part off. Until Hikari met Iroha his life had always been stable and revolved around anime and his passion for it and being able to share his passion with like-minded friends like Itou. But the fortunate encounter between Hikari and Iroha resulted in the birth of not just the unlikeliest of romantic relationships between them but also created within Hikari a desire to change his personality and for the first time in his life embrace the world that he had for so long been ignoring and as a result learn what it actually means to be a human being. While the relationship between Hikari and Iroha is anything but smooth sailing seeing them both work so hard to overcome the many challenges both physical and mental that laid in their path as they try to understand each other’s personalities was something that I thought the story handled really well. But understanding comes in many forms especially when related to love and being able to bond and connect with your other half on an emotional level is just as important a fact that I thought the story dealt with relatively well in showing the secret insecurities that both Iroha and Hikari confronted and eventually overcome as their relationship developed and blossomed. While the development of Iroha and Hikari via their relationship was, of course, the main focus of the story with it comes a secondary aspect that’s just as important as the main one which is how the rest of the school and their classmates and later friends view them. With few exceptions, most of their classmates viewed the couple with scorn not understanding why and how Iroha ended up as a couple with someone like Hikari. But as their relationship develops and Hikari and Iroha’s hearts start to gradually open as they overcome challenges this sense of hatred gradually starts to vanish as for the first time they can see that both are trying hard to overcome the many things that were holding them back. Watching the opinions and attitudes of the supporting cast of the series change as they bore witness to Hikari’s evolution as a character and seeing them gradually realise their error and become friends with him instead of hating him was something that I really enjoyed seeing because it meant that Hikari’s attempts to improve himself had succeeded. <br />
<br />
Overall 3D Kanojo girl was a series that I really enjoyed watching with its unique premise, story and character development being its best points. The gradual understanding between Iroha and Hikari of the fact that love is not just about physical attraction but also an emotional attachment to the person that you love was something that I really enjoyed seeing and makes you realise just how deep your love for someone can be. As a final score, I would say that 3D Kanojo girl deserves a final score of 10/10. <br />

    Typically, a show scored under 7 is garbage. Therefore, it is surprising that this is getting such a poor score.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, it&#039;s not groundbreaking anime but I saw many shows over 7.5 that are definitely worse than this one. I feel like the MAL score is slowly becoming irrelevant.<br />
<br />
I typically can&#039;t handle shoujo anime (the pace is so slow, I feel like dying) but there&#039;s just enough mystery in the story to keep you interested. The character interactions are indeed awkward and cringey but considering the setting it makes perfect sense.<br />
<br />
From the setup, it looks like it&#039;s supposed to be a drama more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278906">
        than a rom-com but it has comedic elements. It&#039;s a little bit odd that it portrays any other male character (other than the mc and his friend) as being complete assholes, but it doesn&#039;t affect your enjoyment.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s worth giving a try.

    There were two-romcom anime that were airing from the spring 18 season. 3D Kanojo Real Girl and Wotaku love are hard for an okatu. However compare to Takagi San which was more a tease feast instead of a romcom both 3D Kanojo Real Girl Kanojo and Wotaku love is hard for an okatu were actually romcom that uses the character, drama, comedy and narrative to the fullest. <br />
However only one of the two romcom anime from the spring 18 seasons was good and that was Wotaku love is hard for an okatu. What Wotaku love is hard for an okatu has over 3D Kanojo Real

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281656">
        Girl is that one the characters were likeable, two that show was well-paced and three the romance was actually great and believable.<br />
<br />
As much I want to go into more detail of why Wotaku is a better romcom anime than 3D Girl Kanojo (stay tune for my review for Wotaku love is hard for an Okatu). In that review I will go into more detail of why I love, Wotaku love is hard for an okatu while I hate this 3D Girl Kanojo which speaking of 3D Girl Kanojo is no contest not only one of the worst anime of 2018 bit is also one of the worst romcoms I have ever seen period.<br />
<br />
So what went wrong with this show. Maybe with the shitshow that was the story<br />
<br />
Am not kidding when I say this is one of the worst romcom stories I have ever seen withness.<br />
For starters, this show does a horrendous job at portraying the okatu culture. Unlike Wotaku love is hard for an okatu where the show portrays the okatu culture in a more realistic way that is grounded and believable this show literally took all of that and throw it out the window in favour being comical and unrealistic. For example in one episode Mitsuya sees Hikaru helping his sister then Mitsuya tells his sister to scream in order for the police to catch him as well as branding Hikaru as a lolicon for days. Okay, I understand if you don’t like the person as the well the hobby that he does but you didn’t really have to out of your way to humiliate him in public like that so he can be an easy target for the police.<br />
People don’t behave like this and that event alone really shows how bad the character interactions are which I get to talk about now.<br />
<br />
Episode 1 alone is the worst first episode I have ever seen a romcom. Instead of having the two main characters slowly learning about each other the show decides to start off with a very contrived pool scene where they both of them fall into the pool. After that, the show decided to have an awkward conversation by having our female lead Iroha ask Tsutsui that he is a virgin and Tsutsui replies honestly. The whole conversation feels forced and unnatural as both characters talk at each other instead of allowing a character they sentence plus nothing from that conversation was remotely interesting and because of these reasons alone, the show did a horrendous job at establishing theses characters.<br />
<br />
To add insult to injury all of this shit happened in the first episode where both of these characters met for the first time. I would have been okay with this if that happened in later episodes where at that point the two main characters started to understand but having that scene happened in very first of the series really shows how poorly directed and written this series is.<br />
<br />
The single worst thing about the show is that the show itself at times literally forgets that it was a romcom anime as it the show at times devolves into a shitty slice of life anime with a poor portrayal of otaku culture which completely kills all the potential romcom thanks to its stiff character interactions and relationships.<br />
<br />
(2020 Review update I watched the second season ).<br />
<br />
Finally, for people who are wondering about the second season. No its not better. Its on par with Season 1 in terms of quality Sure it tired its hardest to fix some of the major issues I had with Season 1 but it wasn&#039;t enough. The damage was done.<br />
<br />
If you the story was bad enough guess what? The character are even worse.<br />
Tsutsui is just your boring and unlikable okatu freak who is hard to relate to thanks to his stiff character interactions.<br />
Iroha is just your typical easy-going girl who jealous a lot. While I liked Iroha more than Tsutsui in terms of personality I still thought she was a pretty mediocre character at best.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast are just throwaway romcom characters that we all seen before as they only to exist to create drama and conflict to the narrative.<br />
<br />
Like with the story and characters the visuals are shit.<br />
The character designs for 3D Kanojo Real Girl are very uninspired as they look like they were done in 1 hour without a second thought.<br />
The animation is below average it constaints of shotty camera angles, still frame and overall weak animation.<br />
<br />
3D Kanojo has very forgettable soundtrack overall. The same can apply to the shows opening theme however the ending theme was kinda decent.<br />
The voice acting in the show is pretty decent overall and all the Seiyuus did a fair job on each role.<br />
Overall the soundtrack is pretty mediocre at best.<br />
<br />
What a total dumpster fire of a romcom.<br />
The story is badly written to the absolute core, the character are all unlikable idiots, mixed with a forgettable ost, weak production values and poor story directing. If you want to watch a good romcom anime from go watch Wotaku love is hard for an okatu instead of this train-wreck.

    **Disclaimer: This is a Rant**<br />
<br />
After the second episode of this anime I was expecting this anime to be better than that atrocious first episode. What I got in exchange was a shitty romcom with misleading topics and very infuriating characters... Can&#039;t believe that this is getting a second season when a lot of good shows out there are left without a sequel. So lets get into details. (There might be spoilers)<br />
<br />
The &quot;story&quot; centers around Tsutsui who is an Otaku who only has one friend (A very shitty friend I must say). well, at least that&#039;s what this anime tries to portray on him. He has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281709">
        not contact with any humans with the exception of his neko best friend, he spends his spare time watching a mahou shoujo anime and that&#039;s pretty much his situation. I don&#039;t know what this anime tried to portray, the life of a very bullied kid or a wannabe &quot;Otaku&quot;, because I&#039;m sure as hell that this isn&#039;t the life of an Otaku, but of a socially awkward person who happens to like a Mahou Shoujo anime, I can relate to Tsutsui&#039;s situation here and thats why I felt so insulted while watching this anime.<br />
<br />
One day Tsutsui meets the most inconsistent bitch in town and for some reason she falls for him (I barely remember what was the actual reason, what I can recall is that the first episode was a clusterfuck of events) and this is where the trainwreck begins. The rest of the anime is spent in misunderstandings and shitloads of melodrama of the lowest quality possible: Tsutsui &quot;Fucks up&quot;, Igarashi gets mad because why not, his &quot;friends&quot; scold him saying that he is a terrible boyfriend, Tsutsui has an existencial crisis, his Mahou shoujo Waifu conforts him and encourages him, Tsutsui Apologizes, Igarashi blushes and accepts apologize, repeat. This not only gets old, its infurating because the reasons Tsutsui &quot;fucks up&quot; aren&#039;t such a big deal to be even mad for. Oh!, and lets not forget the plot device that is never touched again: Igarashi supposedly needs to leave town after 6 months and only God knows why... Is Igarashi going to die? never mind that, because that&#039;s left unanswered. (although I suspect that&#039;s the case)<br />
<br />
Characters in this anime are atrocious, some of them acts as &quot;comic relief&quot; but dear God, this &quot;comic relief&quot; isn&#039;t even cringey, it&#039;s insulting and infuriating!, how I&#039;m supposed to laugh at a &quot;mother&quot; who makes fun of his son and also doesn&#039;t support him when he is a suspected child molester? She doesn&#039;t even seem to care about his son situation on high school. This is not funny, its sad and infuriating, Tsutsui doesn&#039;t even deserve to have such a terrible mother, neither he deserves such shitty friends that are only there at the good times, because whenever Tsutsui &quot;fucks up&quot; they shine for their disappearance, or even worse, they act cold against him and insult him, he doesn&#039;t even deserve to have such an inconsistent bitch as a girlfriend, I swear, Igarashi must have reached the top 10 worst anime girlfriends in anime history.<br />
<br />
The animation isn&#039;t that bad but not great either, there are a lot of terrible shots where characters has deformed faces, it also fails on portraying events. And the sound... Thanks God I&#039;m not going to hear their voices ever again.<br />
<br />
Now I don&#039;t know if this is based on a real story and I don&#039;t really care about that, but dear God, this is a terrible depiction of what love is and what friendship is, its also terrible at describing the life of an Otaku, whoever make this totally missed the point of it. Go watch something like &quot;Welcome to the NHK&quot; which is miles beyond what this anime tried to achieve.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2,5/10<br />
<br />

    Watching 3D Kanojo feels like standing in the middle of no man&#039;s land where two parties are trying to bomb the living shit out of each others with cliches and cringe. By two parties, I mean our two main characters. It&#039;s so over the top, it is actually quite entertaining to watch.<br />
<br />
The writer keeps throwing romance cliches in such a tempo it can only be called an impressive work. Our main girl is full of opposites. At the same time, she is a whore and an innocent treasure. A strong badass and a crying little girl. It&#039;s never certain if what she says is honest

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278951">
        or a lie. I view this is a parody towards generic shoujo leads whose behavior makes no sense whatsoever. The lead guy on the other hand is at the same time a loser otaku and an ideal boyfriend. <br />
<br />
Because of the ridiculously fast pacing, and the girls constant lies, it&#039;s quite hard to get into these characters and call this a good romance. None of it has been made seriously after all, but it does a decent job as a comedy, though it looks like the series will be getting old soon. I can recommend this to folks who have the tendency to hate romances because 3D Kanojo quite well captures all the things that are wrong with them.

    It is often said by many that anime is gradually getting worse. As much as I want to deny this, I can&#039;t help but reluctantly agree. Over the past few seasons, there had been such a lack of originality and overuse of cliches that besides the occasional &#039;a place farther than the universe&#039;, I&#039;m wondering if anime is even trying anymore. Lets take a look at &#039;3D girlfriend&#039;, which, as much as I wanted to like it, I can&#039;t help but getting annoyed by how cliche it is.<br />
<br />
Plot (4/10): The story to this show is extremely mediocre and predictable. A boy who is an otaku

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279015">
        and often bullied meets a girl, the girl changed his initial opinion of 3d girlfriends (whatever that means), falls in love, starts dating, bla bla bla. Basically its &#039;the world god only knows&#039; except its a whole less original and consists of a single relationship. This may not have been a bad thing except the execution is laughably poor. None of the otaku subplot is explored in a meaningful<br />
way at all, which makes me wonder why the show even made the mc an otaku in the first place. The romance is very bad, with poor chemistry between the characters and is badly paced. I mean, come on! They meet and even started dating on the same day? How does that work?<br />
<br />
Character (3/10): Besides the plot, the characters in this show are very unoriginal as well. The main character, tsutsui, I feel is probably one of the blandest shojo leads I&#039;ve seen. Not only does he lack any personality whatsoever, but he is also horribly inconsistent. He<br />
gets angry for no particular reason and is then showed to be placid in the next scene. I suppose this show wants to characterize him as a socially awkward type of guy, but if it is, it does a very terrible job at it. Next up, we have the female protagonist, Igarashi, who, while still being better than Tsutsui, is still very boring. The third character, Itou Yuuto, is hardly worth mentioning since the only bit of development he got is as a plot device for being the mc&#039;s best friend.<br />
<br />
Animation and Sound (5/10): While not being bad, the technical aspects of this show aren&#039;t very good either. The character designs are mediocre, with Tsutsui being the typical high school boy with glasses, which was copied from at least 50 other anime with basically the same design and Igarashi looks like the typical shojo lead with wavy hair. The music in the opening is pretty bad in my opinion although for voice acting, I do like Igarashi&#039;s voice a lot so I&#039;ll keep this category above a 4.<br />
<br />
Overall (4/10): Overall, this show so far is pretty bad. I might watch a few more episodes to see if it gets better but I&#039;ll put it on-hold for now.

    I wouldn&#039;t normally write a review but with all the hate that this show is getting I felt I had to write something... Im not going to go into telling you what this anime is about since you can literally flick back to the main page and read the bio so Im just going to jump right into how I feel about this anime... (FYI score is fully based on entertainment)<br />
<br />
I have never really been in a significant relationship myself... Partly because the idea doesn&#039;t appeal to me, I feel as though there is nothing someone of the opposite sex can offer me while in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282617">
        a relationship that I can&#039;t get outside of one minus the hassle of going out with someone (of course this could just be me being narrow minded since I haven&#039;t been in one) (btw the other half of the reason I havent been in a relationship is because Im just too much of a c**t) so I have no way to say how accurately this anime portrays a socially awkward couple, but even still I want to say just how entertaining this show was... But first, lets look at some of the reasons people might try and avoid this.<br />
<br />
Was it repetitive? Yes<br />
<br />
Did some of the characters make me want to pull my hair out at times? Yes<br />
<br />
Did they shove comedy into some areas it just didn&#039;t belong? I think so.<br />
<br />
Did it follow almost every cliche romance anime hardships known to man? You already know it.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to you all from here on out, this is the unedited stuff coming up and my brain works like a gamer with an apm over 500 (in other words so much crap is going on you start to wonder if everything is even relevant or following a logical order)... Back on track though I think the main reason I liked this anime so much was because of how lighthearted it was (and I dont just mean that in the sense of the humour used), it was relaxing to watch. I binged this thing from 10-4am and when I finally shut my laptop last night and checked the time while setting my alarm I realised just how long I had stayed up watching this... Im not overly craving a second season, I wouldn&#039;t rant about it as being one of the best anime I have ever watched. But the fact that I could kill 6 hours without even realising it, I could have a good laugh and I could get that stupid grin on my face like a 5 year old who has just been told by his parents they will buy him icecream later then I think that is a good anime.<br />
<br />
Anyway in summary, I thought the anime was laid back, chill, fun to watch, interesting and kind of refreshing (Maybe because I wouldnt normally watch stuff like this idk) and if you have a few hours to spare I would certainly say you should give it a go, I mean you have nothing to loose, what you see at the start is what you get. If you don&#039;t like the first 3 episodes then I guess your relationship with this anime wasn&#039;t meant to be...........................................................................

    Note: This review takes into account the combination of the first and second seasons as one continuous plot and rates them as a combined work. Read on and you&#039;ll understand why I&#039;ve chosen this approach.<br />
<br />
If you like when the underdog surprises and punches above their weight, this might be the show for you.<br />
<br />
I watched this series completely on a whim, expecting a lot of lonely otaku wish-fulfillment / pandering. I&#039;ll be quite honest, the start of the first season threw a lot of objectively unbelievable premises at the viewer exactly along these lines. Still, despite the predictably unbelievable start, it had some merits. Once getting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342966">
        past the initial unbelievable developments, the drama and romance aspects that followed were enough to keep me interested and just enough to make me curious about what would happen in the sequel.<br />
<br />
And I&#039;m glad I kept watching. I have to admit that where the first season of this show modestly exceeded my (very low) expectations, the second blew them out of the water. Now keep in mind, blowing very low expectations out of the water doesn&#039;t put this on the same level of some of the great romance / drama series that anime has to offer, but there&#039;s something satisfying about a show that could have been lazy, but chose to rise above its niche and offer something better.<br />
<br />
If you enjoyed the first season, you&#039;ll almost certainly like the second. If for some reason you&#039;re reading this and haven&#039;t watched the first, if the initial lonely otaku pandering aspects of the show don&#039;t turn you off it, it actually ends up being worth the watch. Solid character development, interesting romance and drama. There&#039;s a sense that the author, for whatever flaws there are in the series, had a good concept of the show&#039;s beginning middle and end from the start. Far more than you&#039;d expect from a lot of shows like this that might just drone on in slice of life mediocrity until they peter out on their own.

    Wow, this anime absolutely blew me away. I stopped watching about half way through because I accidentally started another anime and forgot about it. I decided to re watch it a few months later and wow, I really regret not finishing it then.<br />
<br />
The story is absolutely fantastic, the way that love is conveyed in a very realistic sense, giving backgrounds to the characters and giving them unique personalities. You can see change in the characters as the story goes on, you laugh, you cry, its a whole mix of emotions. I just love this anime so much, the ending was such an unexpected turn, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340960">
        expected it to just end out with him not with her anymore, but wow, it was an amazing ending.<br />
<br />
The way the characters grew and evolved when they got truly caring girlfriends who cared for them was amazing. Character development is easily 10/10. This is just my opinion, but to this very day, this is still one of my favorite romance anime and it hit my feels in all of the right places.<br />
<br />
These last few months I have been drowning in romance anime, hoping to find one that could truly truly fill my cold dead heart, the only animes to this day that could do that were 3D Kanojo: Real Girl, and Domestic Girlfriend. I still have a lot to learn about anime, but even so, I feel I have a good judge of anime. Although beauty is in the eye of the beholder and all of that, I can&#039;t help just conveying that this anime is truly a master piece and one of the greatest I&#039;ve seen.

    This anime popped up on kissanime before I had a chance to even look at it&#039;s score from MAL. From what I&#039;ve seen so far I&#039;ve been surprised that such a cliched and typical plot could produce such a quality anime.<br />
<br />
The qualities of this anime does not lie in an amazing plot, or even perfect and picturesque artwork. Its strength lies in the characters and the style in which the plot is presented. While the plot may be cliched, you&#039;re made to feel like you&#039;ve never seen an anime like it before. Other reviewers have claimed that it is full of cringe cliches, however, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280131">
        way the relationship is explored is what varies it from other shoujo romance animes.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s hard to explain how I feel about this anime. It&#039;s like having constant butterflies, in the sense that I can&#039;t predict what&#039;s going to happen next. Perhaps &#039;what&#039;s&#039; was the wrong word, I feel like I can&#039;t predict how the next scene is going to occur. Anyways, I&#039;m not gonna give a full review because the show isn&#039;t over and I feel like the characters is the only thing you really need to worry about review. That&#039;s because the whole show and what makes it good is the uniqueness and earnestness (not sure if this is a word) of the characters.<br />
<br />
Characters- 10: It&#039;s hard to explain why I love the two main characters so much. Everything about them feels both real and unique. While they both have typical anime traits, they represent real problems facing actual people. The male main clearly has social anxiety, and self esteem issues which are cleverly woven into the plot and with his relationship with the female main. The female main character has a much deeper and harder to read psychological profile. She is both forward and reserved, both a liar and a wholesome girl. The studio have alluded to reasons why she is the way she is, but they have smartly kept their hand hidden with that information. This uneasiness adds to the feeling of butterflies mentioned before, they use a combination of lowkey foreshadowing, and her personality and behavior itself to make you feel like something bad is going to happen. You feel like you know already, but it makes me want to watch it even more. Yet the uneasy feeling never fades. The foreshadowing such as her &#039;lying&#039; about a terminal illness or her parents not being there when Tsuntsun visits/stalks her just makes it impossible for me to takes my eyes away from this show. I could write so very much more on just these characters, however, I&#039;ll save it for a full review if ya&#039;ll want to see it.

    *Spoiler Free* Really MAL should ban reviews unless you&#039;ve seen the full season. The fact this has such a low rating is frankly a crime as many fans may be put off what is put off what is possibly one of the best romances in anime.<br />
<br />
3D Kanojo: Real Girl will make you laugh, get frustrated and cry with both sadness and happiness. If you&#039;re looking for a wholesome and compete story with all the right ingredients, this delivers on every aspect you could want.<br />
<br />
You can safely ignore the poor reviews as practically all will not have watched the anime to completion. Just bear in mind

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363227">
        the start will and is intended to frustrate you. The main cast are &quot;supposed&quot; to be somewhat broken and this story follows the development of these high-schoolers as they grow and change.<br />
<br />
Stick with it, don&#039;t give up before the end and I promise you will enjoy a very rewarding journey. Top Tip! There is an extra Final Chapter in the manga which wraps events up which you should definitely seek out after the end of both seasons which will give you that much needed conclusive ending.<br />

    I think that this anime is one that is looked down upon despite having some great moments <br />
<br />
I found that a lot of the time spent between the mc and his gf was extremely heartwarming <br />
<br />
The mc has some cringe moments but that is to be expected from someone who has had no social life up until now <br />
<br />
the art was good but I felt like it had too many pauses and not enough movement <br />
<br />
the op and ed were really good and I still listen to them outside of the show which says a lot about it. <br />
<br />
as for my enjoyment, I had a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334430">
        really good time with the show I and never wanted to put it down watching bout the 1st and 2nd season in one sitting <br />
<br />
overall I would say the show is a 7 it has some flaws but through all of that you have a really nice heartwarming romance

    I understand people think that this show is bad. I understand where all of you are coming from. But I really like the slow pace of this anime. It might be boring to some, but to others it was a great anime. I really loved the plot of the show as well even though some parts of it doesn&#039;t make sense. Like why couldn&#039;t Iroha ask Tsutsui directly.The characters in this anime was also great. If you liked this anime I recommend you watch Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!, Sakura-sou no Pet na Kanojo, and Your Lie in April. If you are looking for movies,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333735">
        watch Your Name, I Want to Eat Your Pancreas, and the Girl who lept through time. AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE DONT WATCH ALL OF THESE IN ONE DAY. Really enjoyed this one.

    Believe me when the description of anime starts with &quot;____ is an otaku&quot; I typically run away, but on a whim I decided to give this a shot and look at this for what it is. <br />
<br />
The story is not very compelling, it is a cliche Messiah complex story where some beautiful girl saves a loser from his life, and he learns to function as a normal individual. What this anime does with this; however, is why it is above par. <br />
<br />
The pacing is great, rather than waiting 12-24 episodes for a love connection dopamine hit the anime zigs and zags with peaks and lows,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278992">
        the ability to connect to the story comes from the strong female lead who is unique in her own right. The character is a liar, who sees the good in people, shes also an outcast, and very honest, however none of this is done as a selling point, her tag line wouldn&#039;t be Iroha the liar, these are all just facets of the personality the author has crafted for her without over accentuating elements to make it seem like some kind of caricature. She feels real, like an attainable idolization of a modern woman. What I don&#039;t like in media is this idiotic completely inhuman moral compass where a character will freak out at another character for lying to them, it&#039;s completely unrealistic, people lie constantly and daily, it is a necessary action. Demonizing it to the point where it becomes a major plot advancement is idiotic. Morality is relative, even personal morality depends on the context and the nuance that is why it is possible to be both a liar and an honest person at the same time which is what the author took advantage of. <br />
Above all she is understanding and forgiving to the main character, putting up with his floundering without backing down thus far. <br />
<br />
The male lead is less interesting but still a well written character his thoughts really reflect that of an autistic guy with no friends. The way he acts and the way he talks is not a cliche woops my hand slipped on your tit anime, it&#039;s more of a guy who is completely lost in human interactions and has no idea how to emote or act. He speaks some funny lines and has moments of redemption, but ultimately his 180 turns in between episodes are exhausting, they go from making so much progress as a couple to him batting her hand away. <br />
<br />
Overall it&#039;s enjoyable and I don&#039;t think people are giving it a fair chance because of the cliched premise. <br />

    This is anime is great to watch. It is a real emotional roller coaster, the main character does really piss me off at times, but overall it’s outstanding. I will say the several of the episodes really pissed me off but the last episode really makes up for it. Overall I really enjoyed the anime. I really felt invested in the story!<br />
<br />
  I really recommend this anime even though it really is an emotional roller coaster. I loved watching it so much that I was left with wanting more. I just wish it didn’t have to end but I guess all good things have

    3D Kanojo, A very not basic nor unique concept. It begins with an otaku met off by the prettiest girl in school. Already it fails to produce a unique concept and you off the bat think that this is one of the most generic concepts out there not to mention the art style but that gets off the hook because it&#039;s generic it gets the job done. In the first season there is little to no response when it comes to character development especially when it comes to Tsutsui. He fails to become a character you like. You don&#039;t hate him but you don&#039;t find

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401975">
        him fun to watch. He is an interesting character but it&#039;s hard to put up with the scenes he&#039;s in. A normal conversation could turn into the chainsaw massacre because he is too akward to have an ongoing interesting conversation. Yes i am aware he is meant to be akward but not to the point where it makes every scene unbearable to watch. The point I&#039;m trying to make is this season lacks character depth immensely. This season felt really rushed and out of character. This anime as a whole has a lot of potential so I&#039;m hoping the second season is better.<br />
I give it a 6/10.

    I am only writing this because it bothers me when someone&#039;s hard work is misunderstood or misrepresented. <br />
I want readers of my review to understand that while the overall story/plot of the anime is mostly unremarkable and hardly creative, the characters themselves and how they drove their own actions is what made this worth a watch. <br />
Real Girl is no masterpiece, but for those of us who enjoy a few romcoms out there, some slice of life shows, this one is definitely in my opinion, not the worst out there at the very least. In fact, all it took for me was to wait out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287013">
        until after the opening theme. The first bit right before the opening of the first episode had me rolling my eyes, but by the time I got half way through the episode, I was already ready to continue to the next one. <br />
<br />
The thing I like most about the two main characters in particular is that although they start off based on a sort of cliche, the story launches itself from there by way of much deeper character development. I even believe that the title of this anime is slightly misleading, as the anime itself doesn&#039;t truly put nearly as much emphasis on &quot;2D vs 3D&quot; as I originally expected. These characters felt relatable and were most definitely deeper and more emotionally thought out than their initial cliche summaries. Not everyone enjoys a simple light hearted romcom (although I admit this one had me crying more than laughing), but for those who do, it is worth the watch. Thank you.

    With all genuineness, after watching this anime. In my perspective, I believe that it wasn&#039;t as awful as the overall score. <br />
<br />
Story : 5/10 <br />
<br />
Hikari Tsutsui, an Otaku who&#039;s fixated with games and 2D girls. Is a teenager who&#039;s socially awkward and has terrible communication abilities. Tsutsui gets tormented in class, and his solitary companion. Yuuto Itou who wears cat ears additionally shares the hopelessness. One day, Tsutsui arrived late at school and had to stay back to clean the pool as punishment. He met a teenager named Iroha Igarashi. Tsutsui endeavors to avoid her and accepts that it is an issue if he is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312465">
        involved with her. But his thought became love, and both Igarashi and Tsutsui fell for each other. <br />
<br />
The story was quite weak and exceptionally feeble. In every episode, an event would be triggered to develop the story. But instead, it causes prosaic in which worsens the story and the romance of the anime. Making me feel irritated. Most or even all of the events triggered are just so cliche, on the off chance that if I am to tally the number of cliches within the series from the first episode to the end. I wouldn&#039;t probably even bother counting them because there&#039;s too many. With this numerous platitudes, the story gets all irritating. <br />
<br />
However, I have seen many anime with cliches. &quot;I don&#039;t mind them that much&quot; because I&#039;m a simple person that doesn&#039;t really mind seeing the same old cliches that make up a romance. Plus, this anime has an Otaku and game obsession. In which I as well is within the same place so I am able to relate with the characters. <br />
<br />
However, I have seen multiples of anime with banalities. &quot;I don&#039;t mind them that much&quot; since I&#039;m a straightforward and simple person that doesn&#039;t generally mind seeing similar old cliches that make up a romance. Besides, this anime has an Otaku and game obsession. In which I too is within a similar spot so I am able to relate with the characters.<br />
<br />
- The story could&#039;ve been way better with less cliches. - <br />
<br />
Art : 6/10 <br />
<br />
For a 2018 anime, I&#039;d truly like to state that the art is trash, exceedingly trash. No, no.Just a few scenes. The art style is quite good, but be that as it may, in certain scenes the art just looks so imprudent like the boss of the studio slapped a couple of bucks on the workers face and say &quot;Sup brother, draw this scene. Make it quick so we can publish this anime to get some cash&quot;. A few scenes looks like shrunken plant cells in a concentrated salt solution and in some other scenes there are likewise some high-quality off-season dragon balls April fools joke displayed for me to appreciate cheerfully while sitting on my chair. OK, jokes aside, genuinely. It art really sucks. <br />
<br />
One good thing about the art are the characters. One motivation behind why I continued this anime until the end is because the main female character looks like a heater. ( lol ) <br />
<br />
Sound : 7/10 <br />
<br />
The sound is alright, I appreciate listening in to the OP of the anime and most of the time I did not skip it. The ED is fine too. For voice acting, the voice actors have fluid voice but they need to work on expressing the feelings of characters better. For sound effects, background musics and stuffs, it&#039;s also fine. <br />
<br />
Character : 7/10 <br />
<br />
What I personally like about this anime are the characters. They look good, they have great voice acting, and I like the art style of the characters. However, the flaws of the characters are the fact that their character development is badly developed. Okay, sure, NOT SO BAD. I did like the changes of several characters as time passes, but the cliches from the story made the character development worse. Other than that, there&#039;s nothing else to complain about the characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 7/10 <br />
<br />
I enjoyed this anime, it was relaxing and chilling.. <br />
<br />
Overall : 7/10 <br />
<br />
This anime has a lot of potential to become one of my favorite anime, thus I am giving it another chance. I have heard that the season 2 of this anime was a come back and people was insane about it. I hope that is true. <br />
<br />
Time to get to season 2.

    This is some serous incel shit<br />
it&#039;s unbelievable some group of people actually animated this and chose those dialogues<br />
this is supposed to be a romance anime but it isn&#039;t, there is no romance it&#039;s just some average dude who is shy and awkward and suddenly gets a hot girlfriend and EVERY TIME the girl tries to touch him,he instantly rejects her touching because he is an incel, the situation is so bad that they almost broke up because he is so insecure and beta, of course in real world that would have happened but since this is FANTASY it doesn&#039;t<br />
<br />
Why the hot girl is in love

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402715">
        with him and wants to kiss and touch him? because she knows he is a &quot;good person on the inside&quot;, you get it boys, this was the magical formula all along to get into woman&#039;s pants, if only we would have realized it sooner<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s talk about the characters, well lets see, yeah they exist<br />
<br />
Soundtrack and opening and ending songs are forgettable and bad<br />
<br />
The animation is nice but who gives a shit?<br />
<br />
In conclusion this is not an anime that explores romance, there is no tension, everything is forced, there is no built up for anything, do not watch this anime or shall i say garbage
