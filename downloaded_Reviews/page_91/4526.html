    It hurts, as a big Inazuma Eleven fan who watched the franchise ever since the first season of Inazuma Eleven was still airing, to give such a low rating for an Inazuma Eleven franchise. But... here we are.<br />
<br />
I waited until I watched every episode of this to know for sure whether or not I would be certain of my decision, and having watched all 49 episodes I can say this with no regret: I am really disappointed with what Orion has become.<br />
<br />
I also make a handful of references to the other installments of Inazuma Eleven in this review to try and emphasize my point.<br />
<br />
Story (3/10)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318831">
        - All right, so those watching Orion will directly notice several things. Orion takes inspiration from the other Inazuma Eleven seasons, every one of them if you want to analyze every little frame, and this was a nice idea. It would serve as a little bit of an easter egg for the faithful fans who have watched every episode of every season where we could go &quot;Ah, that came from Galaxy, and that one came from the Aliea Academy arc!&quot;... but the execution of everything is horrid, there is no other way to describe it. By trying too hard to reference everything, Orion ends up in this weird space where it cannot stand out from the others. Sure there are only so few plot ideas they could have gone for with what is effectively Inazuma Eleven&#039;s eighth arc, but it really feels very weak. Orion also suffers from the same pacing problem that Ares had, but then cranked up to an eleven (more on that in the Enjoyment part of this review). In short, the story tried to focus on one specific plot point but it ended up becoming a rushed mess that, honestly, was quite all over the place.<br />
<br />
Art (4/10) - With a new franchise come new techniques and new animation techniques to, well... animate the techniques. The animation of all the new techniques introduced in Orion (and there are a lot of them!) has certainly improved, but none barring one (maybe two) of these were techniques that left me with a spark and in awe.<br />
Orion also does this thing where they have goal celebrations from the characters of the main team, especially in the first half of Orion. I know that there are goal celebrations in the other installments of Inazuma Eleven, but these somehow feel... choppy and kind of awkward. I am not that big of a fan of these if that was not obvious.<br />
<br />
Sound (6/10) - The soundtracks of Inazuma Eleven has always been pretty good, and even though I feel like it has gone down with Ares and Orion, they&#039;re still pretty decent. I will also admit that I am a pretty big fan of the third ED of Orion and more than its OP, which is something I can&#039;t say I am since Maji Bomber all the way back in the original Inazuma Eleven&#039;s third season.<br />
<br />
Character (2/10) - Oh boy... I could write this whole review just about the characters in Orion, but... let&#039;s try and just get to the point. The Inazuma Japan from the original Inazuma Eleven had sixteen members at any given time. The Inazuma Japan from Galaxy had thirteen members at most. Orion&#039;s Inazuma Japan starts out with nineteen members right from the first episode, which is a bigger problem than most people might realize. The characters themselves are perfectly fine, that&#039;s not the issue. What is the issue is that there is no way for us to bond with any of them as there is no feasible way for Orion to properly showcase any character growth whatsoever (except if you are one of the main characters). <br />
The worst part of all this is that they were doing okay for the first half of Orion, because once it got to the world tournament they ended up ADDING characters to the main team. Sure we also lost some characters along the way, but we ended with a surplus of characters. And that would have been okay if those new additions got the respect they deserved, but the moment that they had their place in the spotlight they were sidelined almost immediately after. And that, to me, is sadder than if they had not been brought on to the team to begin with...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (1/10) - Let&#039;s just get this out of the way early: at some point, I ended up watching Orion not because I enjoyed it or because I wanted to know what would happen next, but to find out how they would try and salvage what was left to salvage.<br />
On a very basic level, I could enjoy it when new techniques were shown. But the Inazuma Eleven fan inside of me knows that I was disappointed throughout the entire run of it. And it all can be concluded by one word: pacing. The pacing of Orion is, as much as it hurts me to say this about an Inazuma Eleven installment, horrible. There is almost no scene shown where characters are training their new techniques in the later episodes, making it seem like they &quot;learned the technique out of nowhere&quot; when they use them in the match. There is very minimal interactions going on between the characters to help us understand how their dynamic is with other characters that we do not know of already (I mean, Endou interacted with Kidou, sure, but we have seen Endou interact with Kidou all the time. Show him interacting with someone like Haizaki who he hasn&#039;t interacted with before). In addition, there was also very minimal downtime in between each match (downtime which could have been used to show character development or have them train a new technique together or something).<br />
And the matches, ESPECIALLY the latter half of Orion, ends up being the two teams throwing around hissatsus left, right and center. Which, to be fair, I know is what Inazuma Eleven&#039;s matches is supposed to be about, but thanks to the lack of training scenes shown it seems like they are pulling those hissatsus out of thin air. I would be okay if that would be for the big final technique or whatever, but it happened almost all the time.<br />
<br />
It says a lot about how disappointing this was when I enjoyed the start of Orion (say... the first 19 episodes) more than I did everything that followed. And, yes, I did rewatch the start of Orion again to confirm this.<br />
<br />
Overall (3/10) - A really neat story idea all in all with a lot of potential, but with very poor execution and finishing which ended up ruining all of that. After having finished watching Orion, I really wish they just stopped with Inazuma Eleven after Galaxy ended. Maybe my hopes and expectations were too high and/or unrealistic for Orion, but the fact remains that I am disappointed with the final result.

    Inazuma Eleven Ares was one of most disappointing series comebacks I&#039;ve ever seen. The story was incredibly rushed thanks to it&#039;s dreadful pacing. The writing was shallow at best, most of the new characters sucked and the visuals were underwhelming .<br />
It had some good moments but those moments didn&#039;t save the anime from being painfully disappointing.<br />
Before Inazuma Eleven Ares finished airing OLM announced a squeal for it called Inazuma Eleven Orion. Like with many Inazuma Eleven fans I was super excited for it as I thought Orion would be the tasteful main course that would overshadow its amateur hour starter that was Ares. I thought

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319772">
        this series would be amazing. So, I watch it and I wish I haven&#039;t.<br />
I just going to say this right now Inazuma Eleven Orion is not only the worst entry of the series but is also one of the worst animes I have ever watched in a long while. It&#039;s like the staff took everything that was wrong with Ares and managed to crank it up to 11.<br />
<br />
One of the main problems you will notice right out of the gate is its fan-fiction nature when it comes to it&#039;s writing. This was a massive problem in Ares that ultimately plagued it but Orion takes it to the next level to a point where became unbearable. The writing in Orion feels like it was written by a clumsy student who had no creativity and passion. The same student thought it was a brilliant idea to add dark themes and topics on a franchise that rarely had dark themes and topics in it. Ladies and Gentleman that&#039;s the plot of Inauma Eleven Orion in a nutshell. It&#039;s vapid, boring, hollow, ham-fisted and most importantly tedious to watch.<br />
As for the Orion Foundation plot itself it was hot garbage. Not only it was terribly written it&#039;s also incredibly generic. This plot is only interesting if haven&#039;t seen an organisation plot in your life. It is the most generic and stock evil organisation plot imaginable and it&#039;s not even handled well. This generic written plot was only made worse by the inclusion of politics in the second half.<br />
I wish I was making this up. The show had the nerves to throw in politics in a series that was meant for kids. This wouldn&#039;t been a problem if the politics stuff was foreshadowed in Ares but nope it popped out of nowhere just like the rest of the so called plot twists in this show. With the inclusion of politics the tone, pacing even dialogue go to shit as the devolved into this uninspired and badly written political, sports, spy series that contradicts everything that this franchise has stood for since 2008.<br />
It doesn&#039;t help that the main villain of the show Irina Girikanan is so one dimensional. She is evil for the sake of being evil. She has no motivation whatsoever other than to use children from various countries to take over the world with her contrived Orion Foundation plan.<br />
<br />
Now if you thought the pacing in Ares was bad than guess what the pacing in Orion is somehow even worse. For a long semi-tournament arc we don&#039;t see the characters actually train let along bond with each other. Sure the show has some downtime moments but it&#039;s not the type of downtime that you expect. It uses its downtime to focus on the Orion Foundation plot instead of developing its characters through training and bonding.<br />
The lack and character bonding really hurts the pacing as well the characterisation because the show would rather focus on it&#039;s contrived written Orion Foundation plot which was very rushed instead having a couple of episodes where the characters are just getting along with each other. Inazuma Japan never felt like a actual team. Sure they play in matches with each other, and they attend coach meetings but the majority of the characters in Inazuma Japan have little to no chemistry with each other.<br />
When Endou interacts to Gouenji or Kazemaru it feels natural because they have been good friends and teammates for a long time but when he interacts to any of the new characters it felt so forced and unnatural especially when some of the new characters like Kira, Hazaiki and Hiura never had a single sentence with each other. That&#039;s not all because there&#039;s hardly any training all of the hissatsu that the characters pull off for the first time felt like asspulls.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with Orion&#039;s plot by far is the over-reliance of plot twists. Not only they were heavily abused but the majority of them were just stupid. Don&#039;t get me started with the final plot twist that happened in the final 3 episodes.<br />
I won&#039;t mention it here due to heavy spoilers but I want you to imagine the worst type of plot twist. The type of plot twist that completely betrays everything that the show previously set up. The type of plot twist that rips off another series plot twists in the different continuity.<br />
That&#039;s the final plot twist in Inazuma Eleven Orion in a nutshell. It&#039;s so bad, so tasteless it made me want me to slam my head on a wall for half an hour.<br />
<br />
Oh the characters aren&#039;t much better at all. I even go as far that the characters were way worst than the god awful plot.<br />
Inazuma Japan has over 20 characters yet almost all of them aren&#039;t develop for shit. Prime examples include Kira, Gounji, Nishikage, Hiura, Iwato, Mansaku, Norika Sakanoue and Kozoumaru. They don&#039;t do anything noteworthy in the plot and they have no character development whatsoever. Heck some of the members are literately there just for memes I wish I was joking...<br />
<br />
The OG crew are somehow even worse. All of the character development and personality quirks have been thrown out the window and what you left with are empty shells of characters we grown to love.<br />
Fudou went from being a likeable jerk with a heart of gold to an annoying edgelord who just exist for bench memes.<br />
Hiroto went from being a well written badass to a worthless background character with no personality.<br />
Kazemaru (My favourite OG character) went from being a competitive and loyal friend to Endou to a boring and hollow background character.<br />
The biggest insult of them all was Endou (My second favourite character). Endou went from being a likeable, funny, well written and developed character to a infuriating, overpowered Gary Sue with no personality and development.<br />
The only two OG characters that still had their personality quirks from the original series is Kidou and Goeunji and yet they were victim of the shows plot contrivances where they were shafted in favour of Ichihoshi who is garbage.<br />
<br />
Ichihoshi is not a character. He&#039;s a husk. A husk that is so contrived and unoriginal . He&#039;s backstory is a complete ripoff off of Fubiki with his tragic backstory. He even go as for antagonistic the OG characters by either getting them injured in a match or kicked them out of the team with some evil scheme. All of this happens because Ichihoshi couldn&#039;t control himself and he had to take out his frustration towards others.<br />
I honestly cannot for the life of me stand characters that behave like douche-bags just because they love ones have died. I understand losing your loved ones is tragic but there&#039;s no reason to take it out on others.<br />
By the time this Fubiki knockoff opens up to the team he becomes a total plot device where the only two things that he does is to be loyal to Asuto and be the tool for the Orion in the second half.<br />
<br />
Why Inazuma Eleven Orion why did you have to ruin one of the best written characters in Ares Haizaki. In Ares he had a well written backstory that made him more then just another typical soccer player. He was fighting through the Ares system as a act of revenge due to what happened to his childhood friend Akane. It was an amazing subplot that had a strong payoff.<br />
So what did the writers do to him in Orion? Well you take all of his character development, threw it out the window and turn him into the second coming of Shadow the Edgehog.<br />
<br />
The only good character in Orion is Nosaka. I really liked his character development in Orion. He went from being a distance individual who barely interacts to anyone to a badass tactics captain who is able to lead Inazuma Japan as the secondary captain.<br />
<br />
Finally we Asuto who is without a question the worst character in the entire show. Not only he was one dimensional as hell but he was also downright infuriating to watch.<br />
He&#039;s basically Tenma without the charm and quality that made him a great character in the first place. Sure Tenma did some dumb things throughout the GO saga but he&#039;s character development across the series as well his personality and interactions make up his shortcomings. Asuto has none of that. He is just a soulless, annoying, inpet, vapid, and exasperating little dipshit from beginning to end. Let&#039;s not forget that he&#039;s a total numskull. He aggressively defends Ichihoshi even though everyone in the team is against him due to his nasty actions that he committed to the team. One of those actions almost had a teammate (Endou) killed and yet this asswipe still has the nerves to value him as a teammate.<br />
Get the hell outta here with your contrived bullshit.<br />
The final nail in the coffin for this pathetic excuse of a protagonist is that he has no character development at all. From episode 1 of Ares to episode 49 of Orion he&#039;s still the same static character that we all know and hate.<br />
There&#039;s bad characterisation and there&#039;s not giving a damm and Asuto is down the ladder leading towards the rabbit hole. That&#039;s why I cannot stand this dipshit of a character and he&#039;s the main reason why I hate Inazuma Eleven Orion so much. If it wasn&#039;t for this sack of shit I wouldn&#039;t have hated this show so much.<br />
It would still be a massive disappointment due to it&#039;s character shafting and terrible plot but I wouldn&#039;t have been so mad at it but because of Asuto annoying presence I went from mildly disliking Orion to utterly despising it.<br />
Curse you Asuto you good for nothing dipshit.<br />
<br />
So how about the supporting characters? Aren&#039;t they any good? No.<br />
They are just as bad as the main team.<br />
The teams that Inazuma Japan face-off have no personality as they were full blown plot devices especially the Perfect Spark and Ole de Samba teams.<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s talk about this show technical aspects Let&#039;s be real honest with our self&#039;s.<br />
This show came out in 2018-2019 and yet the show looks it was made over a decade and a half ago mainly due to the because of the terrible production values. The animation if you can call it animation at times was terrible. It had a lot choppy animation, heavily relayed on stock footage which became jarring fast and match choreography was clunky.<br />
The only decent thing about the visuals is the art and even then it&#039;s inconsistent as character models would go off model.<br />
The soundtrack is just as lame as the plot. The old tracks while good lost a lot of charm thanks to how overused they were. As for the new tracks they were absolutely terrible. Not only they don&#039;t fit the tone of the show at all but the tracks seem to mindlessly drown in the background with no melody to it.<br />
To Orion&#039;s credit the opening themes were catchy and memorable tho I cannot say the same thing for the ending themes as they were dull.<br />
<br />
All of these problems ties up to the biggest problem with not only Orion but this alternative timeless as a whole the lack of creativity and passion.<br />
When I first watched Orion I thought the series would go back it&#039;s classic routes that we all know and love but just after watching the first quarter of Orion I started to notice that there was a little to no passion towards this series for example almost all of the matches themselves were a void of life and excitement. The production values for the matches didn&#039;t help it at all and the matches feel like a vehicle for the shows pathetic and poorly written drama.<br />
What makes it even worse is how hamfisted the plot is. The series tried to tackle serious themes and topics such as child abuse, political control, grief, acceptance but not only they were poorly executed due to poor writing and direction but it also has the nerve to shot out how brilliant and complex it is when it&#039;s actually not.<br />
If, you don&#039;t know how handle and execute than don&#039;t put them in the show. It&#039;s makes your series more vapid and dumb than it already is.<br />
<br />
Even with my bias love with this franchise I still detest Inazuma Eleven Orion with a burning passion. It&#039;s an insufferable garbage fire that completely contradicts everything that&#039;s this franchise stood for. It&#039;s like this show was done by 25 Inazuma Eleven fanboys who had no communication with one another.<br />
As a result the plot, pacing, themes, dialogue, characters, visuals and music is broken. Not even Nosaka can save this pile of waste.<br />
Orion is not only the worst anime I have seen in 2019 (worst than Fairy Gone, Wise Man&#039;s Grandchild Index S3 and Arifureta) but also one of the worst animes I have ever watched from this decade. It&#039;s a boring, insulting, unfocused, lifeless, miserable and broken mess of an anime that has no passion and soul.<br />
I feel so betrayed.

    I&#039;ve watched 7 episodes so far, and I have to say that Orion has taken a firm approach with the story and characters that was missing in Ares. I&#039;m reviewing this show as a 20-year old dude who has been watching Inazuma Eleven for 8 years.<br />
<br />
The story is much better; there is the usual scary organization behind the scenes that uses middle schoolers to take over the world or something. However, the team&#039;s response is finally worthwhile. Kidou gives no shits about the wholesome soccer spirit and actually fights back. Episode 6 in particular was so enjoyable because finally they decided to beat up their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297697">
        enemies instead of the other way around. It was really funny to see the trope being reversed, and I laughed so hard in that episode<br />
<br />
I also really like the progression of power in Orion so far. Goenji is as hype as I wanted, and his plays removed the stale taste from Ares. It&#039;s also great that Inazuma Japan is actually evenly matched with the other Asian teams, and they have to rely on beating the other teams&#039; gimmicks rather than just getting powerups through the course of the match. I&#039;m glad that they stopped the whole V2, V3, G2, G3 system and simply use hissatsu tactics, shoots and goalie moves. Endou&#039;s power up is great too, and doesn&#039;t feel forced. The team already has incredibly strong hissatsus like The Explosion, Perfect Penguins, so they can contend with the Asian teams while still developing even stronger ones that are world-level instead of Asia level.<br />
<br />
Art is really good at times and acceptable most of the time. Kinda sad that it sometimes isn&#039;t as pretty. Music is awesome and gets me hyped.<br />
<br />
Characters look good for now. Ichihoshi definitely will get a character development arc soon, and Kidou as usual is the best character of the series. Kidou, Gouenji, and Endou easily made Orion better than Ares, but so far Endou hasn&#039;t had as much impact as Kidou, Haizaki, Hiroto, and Gouenji. I&#039;m looking forward to Nosaka coming back as he was the best character of Ares.<br />
<br />
Overall I&#039;m giving it a 9 because the show has broken some old annoying tropes, has paced itself well, and has a solid plot progression.

    Story 6/10 :<br />
Again a new system comes as always, but this time it is a bit too much. They included all the old characters and now kicking them out one by one. The FFI was also in the main first season, but this time too awkard.<br />
<br />
Art 4/10 :<br />
Well I don&#039;t know they are sort of time or money on the animation, but it is just worsening after each episode, definitionely not expected from animes such a shit animation.<br />
<br />
Character 6/10<br />
Just as Inazuma franchise, 1 or 2 traitors are always there, they aren&#039;t developing much, except Endou and Inamori, all have accepted the traitor but just can&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295302">
        kick him out, and they hit him in Australia, yet he is in perfect condition.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8/10 :<br />
As I like Inazuma franchise from since I was small, I still enjoy this anime as Endou and Gouenji are there.<br />
<br />
Overall 7/10 :<br />
It is somewhat decent series, but animation is worsening, might be worth watching once. If planning to watch one, watch the previous season first.

So as a Inazuma Eleven fan this really just hurts, that I have to write a review because this season of Inazuma Eleven has gone downhill so much from its previous season which also wasn&#039;t the best(I&#039;m talking about Inazuma Eleven Ares no tenbin) and because I am such a Inazuma Eleven fan I tried to enjoy this I really did but it is just not it. Overall the animation is just really bad and the development of the story is just really rushed. The only small pluspoints I can give this new season is it use of old characters although they don&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307110">
        seem to develop like they used to in the first season and the sound is alright the soundtracks are really fun and entertaining but the rest is just really bad sometimes there is not even a sound if the ball is passed. Anyway lets get to it.<br />
<br />
Story | 5/10: To me the story feels really forced because they are using the same Inazuma Eleven formula again, there is a team they&#039;re the underdogs and there is a traitor within the team. And because of the same formula from the first season it really has gotten predictable. And because of it being so predicatble they tried to change it by adding a company known as the Orion Foundation just as an excuse to get rid of some characters by making a person that works for the Orion Foundation participate in a match and wound a player my for example throwing spikes on the ground like literally spikes (No the referees nor anybody else exept the players notice this). And because of this absurd way of getting rid of characters this story really is bad.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation | 3/10: I already talked about this a little but the animation feels really and I mean really sluggish, Also there is no signs in improving, it just looks like they threw their whole budget into the game (that got delayed multiple times already) and because of that the animation is just straight up bad, if you look at the art/animation of Inazuma Eleven Go, Inazuma Eleven Go Chrono Stones and Inazuma Eleven Go Galaxy the animation is just really bad. Though the animation is bad the art is al right I like the way they look more grown up, the old series made them look like they were kids which they are but I mean they looked like theyre from Primary school. Anyway the animation can only improve and the art can get better in its own way.<br />
<br />
Sound | 5/10: I have mixed feelings about the sound, the OST&#039;s are good, they are reusing some of my favorite tracks from the previous seasons and the new ones are also likeable, but that is not the problem the problem with the sound lies within the sound effects. They are just so bad sometimes even the creators give op by not including the sound of a shot when the ball has been shot and  that really is a waste because some great voice actors are working on this (Endou has same voice actor as Naruto Uzumaik Ichinose Kazuya has the same voice actor as Eren Jeager). But same as with the animation it can only get better!<br />
<br />
Character | 7/10: I gotta say the characters are the best part of this season, lets start with the good part once; the base of the characters is there some of my all time favorite characters are in there, and I love seeing them mix in with the new characters who are likeable too, but the problem with the characters is that because there are this many characters some characters get no development or the development feels forced, they solved this problem in the first season and in the Go season, but in this season they really didn&#039;t put any work in this and its a shame because again the characters are so likeable but because they can&#039;t develop naturally really hurts.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment | 4/10: As I mentioned already I tried my hardes enjoying this but it is just not good I was so hyped up when I saw that there was going to be more Inazuma Eleven action because Inazuma Eleven Ares no Tenbin was not too bad, they had some of problems but not as much as this anime has so far, its just really unsatisftying to see one of my favorite shows I grew up with end up being so bad. But once again they can only get better from here on.<br />
<br />
Overall | 5/10: so I rate this anima a 5/10 just because it is the sequel of a great anime if this was a first season I would have given it even less. It really hurts inside me that I have to give it this low rating and I wasn&#039;t too strict while rating it because it is the sequel of the show I grew up with but I just can&#039;t give it higher then a 5 sorry people who are enjoying this and if you are good for you I sincerely hope you will keep enjoying it but this show just is not what I was hoping it was.<br />
<br />
well then that was a lot of work but I guess my unsatisfying feeling is gone a little, see you around people!

    This anime has way to many characters like I have no idea what the writers were thinking. You want a shit ton of strikers for no reason? You want 3 goal keepers? Unlikeable characters? cough cough Goujin or characters with absolutely no personality? Like many the only reason I watched this was to see my favourite OG characters in action like the Fubuki brothers which I was most excited for but my excitement quickly faded. Fubuki barely had any screen time to begin with like all the other characters since there was simply to many but then they had to get him injured and become

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382856">
        some spy for no fucking reason. Then they added Atsuya to the team who also got barely any screen time you could write him out the show and nothing would of changed that&#039;s how pointless most of the characters were.<br />
  <br />
<br />
I do not recommended watching this most characters get shafted after a like a episode.

    Inazuma Eleven, what happened to you?<br />
<br />
I tolerated Ares as a show of wasted potential, but now Orion made me feel hollow inside. At this point, they seemed to stop trying. The story basically repeated events that happened in the original FFI arc; the difference was that they removed all the emotional weight. The characters didn&#039;t seem to grow as people. Certain plot lines and acts made no sense. Interesting ideas were wasted and the finale was a complete joke. <br />
<br />
What was sadder was that it started out pretty strong. There was something corrupt in the soccer world, something that may bring up mature and thought

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365556">
        provoking topics. Unfortunately, they didn&#039;t run with that and what I got was shallow recycled plot lines. They nearly got the antagonist right, but they did certain unnecessary things. Not even the OG cast could save the show.<br />
<br />
I tried my best to watch Orion with an open mind. There were things I found enjoyable. The artwork and OST were great, and the preliminaries were my favorite. However, I just couldn&#039;t help but be disappointed. The show literally wasted 49 episodes on bad writing when they could&#039;ve done better.

    Growing up as as a kid with the original Inazuma Eleven was an experience I can&#039;t put in words. After watching the Galaxy series I felt disappointed with about how the series came to an end. After years of hoping for something new, Ares and Orion came around and I must say, it filled the holes I had prior to their beginning. Focusing on Orion, I must say they got everything about right, from the hissatsu animation to story, everything worked, however the show isn&#039;t lacking disappointment either. It&#039;s true that the years passed and my anime liking decreased, but Inazuma Eleven always had always

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349763">
        been something I&#039;d always watch if a new series would come, even if I quit watching anime for a long time. i wish they had more time to finish the story, as it was VERY rushed, even worse than Galaxy, and that&#039;s saying a lot. This is a great addition to the series for the fans and for the newcomers as well.

    Orion in my opinion is a masterpieces and is the best Inazuma season of all time. No one is too minor in the team, everybody gets decent screen time, and the animations are way superior than they used to be. The matches are not too long nor too short and the best part of the show being Nosaka. Not gonna spoil much but how he is in control of the entire team during match and outside of match as if he knows almost everything and haizaki and Kira Hiroto give the show sufficient amount of comedy. Its a masterpiece. On top of that you can&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414287">
        predict what&#039;s gonna happen next its so exciting to watch. And as many people want in an anime we say major character development and see backstory as season progresses of Ichihoshi.
