    The first thing you will notice about this anime is how high-quality the production is. The storyboarding and animation is extremely fluid and seamless, making this an absolute visual delight. The soundtrack is beautiful and I feel like both the OP and ED are no-skips (the OP is performed by Centimillimental who also sang the iconic Given OP, which is one of my personal favorite anime openings of all time).<br />
<br />
The story and characters seem to be standard sports anime fare so far, but it still feels quite refreshing to watch. The characters&#039; interactions with each other are hilarious and guaranteed to make you smile more

        than once in every single episode. The all-star VA cast is brilliant and brings so much life to the show.<br />

I&#039;m honestly very impressed by Bakuten so far, not only does it look really good but it&#039;s also really wholesome. I hope the direction and production quality stays the same throughout (*cough* Haikyuu S4 part 2 outsourced episodes *cough*), and I&#039;m really looking forward for the rest of the episodes to air!<br />

    When I looked up that Bakuten would be a rhythmic gymnastics anime, I confess I was suspicious. Actually, I was afraid. Last year we had Taisou Zamurai, a show that even with a budget and problems in getting made because of the work of the Mappa studio, was an anime that exceeded most general expectations, even though it was quite limited. But why would this cause me to be surprised to have a new anime that follows the same kind of sport? Well, it is the goal orientation that differentiates the two anime.<br />
<br />
Unlike Taisou Zamurai, Bakuten focuses on several characters actively connected to the show&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404343">
        sport. This group interaction is a demanding quality of the very construction of each of the characters, since it is Rhythmic Gymnastics, a sport where athletes perform in groups, usually with 6 members. Not only is this formatting fully utilized in the show, but the anime also creates, verbalizes, and positions itself in other groups, from a rival school, to even with the College Club coach himself. Futaba, the protagonist, is an inexperienced kid who, like everyone else, creates a bond out of appreciation for the unfamiliar sport. It is not unusual to think about this. Often, out of prejudice, we imagine that a type of sport has a remarkable quality only in one of the sexes. For example, it is constantly noticeable that we see people saying that Soccer is a sport only for men, or that Volleyball and Handball is focused on women, but Bakuten acts in the opposite way to these social restrictions and creates a new atmosphere within the anime. The show subtly dispels these erroneous ways of thinking and produces a breakdown of expectation in the audience. Futaba, along with us, experiences this sense of integration within the anime without being expository or overdone. <br />
<br />
If on one hand Bakuten presents a highlight in its accurate setting, the show creates a great process of immersion and interaction between the characters. In fact, much of what happens in the anime comes from the dormitory. Onagawa, Shichigahama, Tsukidate and Watari are the ones who live daily with Futaba within the locality, which at the same time is a process that creates a greater trust inside and outside of the tatami. Misato is the sixth character on the team and enters after the first regional championship, precisely because he feels blocked in the sport, as he has too much personal responsibility. And one cannot only talk about the current athletes. Kurikoma is the cutest character in the show, being the club assistant. Finally, Shida is the club manager and coach of the team. He was similar to Misato in many ways. In fact, the resemblance was so great that it was frightening. Shida was a brilliant gymnast. Maybe the best at that time. However, his self-centeredness did not allow him to trust and believe in the evolution of younger and unprepared people. Futaba is the essential channel for Shida&#039;s overcoming.<br />
<br />
However, an anime like Bakuten needs movement and impact, doesn&#039;t it? That&#039;s right! The biggest problem in expecting quality from a show like Bakuten is the form and effect the anime causes during the climax of its actions and gestures. Zexcs studio is not really a safety when it comes to offering a quality in their shows. In fact, opening their anime page and coming across things like Diabolik Lovers is not a positive for Bakuten. Even with that, it was a studio that evolved dramatically and displayed incredible competence and skill in the overall ornaments and choreography of the characters. The use of computer graphics (CG) is great within the show and attention is also focused on the more superficial details. Within a gymnastics show, mistakes and penalties happen all the time. The anime bravely ensured this and made a great production in the very rich moments. The show brought with it an aspect of realism, which also allows it to show that even if the club has a great evolution with time, it is necessary to train more and more, to reach the National tournament, for example.<br />
<br />
Going back to the characters, I have to applaud the author of this show. The formation of the main group was different at first sight, but a friendship formed over time. As the show expands the future of the characters, the past is recounted impressively. For example, Onagawa is one of the founding students of the club at the high school. He suited up to be the club&#039;s famous &quot;number one&quot; and put together a primitive team with Shichigahama and Tsukidate. However, his quality as an athlete is evidently not easy to achieve. His own process of transformation within the show is visible in the second half of the show. Since the entrance of Misato, the boy wonder, Onagawa has felt charged to evolve in order not to be &quot;outdone.&quot; Even though he could try and train much harder, he reserved himself mentally and gave his activities a rest (with a fake injury), to rehabilitate himself and help the whole group. Misato, along with everyone else, was inspired by the sport through Shida, but at the same time that gymnastics has taken him to great places and awards, he has an internal frustration. Without his parents, he has lived with his aunt ever since, which has given him a sense of importance with people. However, the same responsibility he carries does not help him emotionally inside the tatami, because of an accident in the sport two years ago. This internal block did not lead to Misato&#039;s evolution. Even if he was a brilliant athlete, being second in the National tournament, being too resilient and thoughtful, and charging himself too much are aspects that formed his mind and created a self-defense. This hard and rigid shell was only really broken down from the moment Futaba encourages him and provides emotional support during the episodes. Even though this only materialized in episode 9, from the very beginning the two helped each other. The union of this duo with the rest of the team is not only a great choice, but it allowed for different themes and views on what the sport really means to each one.<br />
<br />
I should also point out the comedy of the anime. Bakuten is not entirely focused on training and competitions. Many striking moments come from a joke, an entertainment or a joke. Even during intensive training with the Shiro High School team, our beloved group keeps its jovial essence and creates a gentle and liberating atmosphere. The hide-and-seek episode for example was one of the funniest in the show for me. All the pressure level created because of the championships is softened and ironized in a single episode dedicated especially for this moment. (I still want to know who is the scary character that appeared to the boys, it gave me a fright, Lol).<br />
<br />
Finally, many moments make for a great show like Bakuten. The staff&#039;s work is a great proof of artistic evolution and allows us to broaden our attention and our gaze on animes with different themes than the common ones. Remember Mashiro no Oto? Then, Bakuten is another show that knew what to do from the very first episode, created sublime moments, and surprised in numerous aspects, from the formation of the characters, to even the apexes, which demanded of the studios. Shin-Ei was a studio that improved its own reputation with Mashiro no Oto. For Bakuten, Zexcs was most responsible for this great technical execution of an original anime. It&#039;s really a pleasure to have followed 12 episodes with quality. I look forward to the movie of the show, which can offer us much more! And long live sports!

    It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve stumbled upon an anime that really got me hooked within just the first few episodes.<br />
<br />
As I lead a few dance clubs at school myself, I thought this show about boys&#039; rhythmic gymnastics would be cool. And I was right. It is. In the first episode, we get to watch a performance held by the boys of Ao High. The animation in this anime switches consistently from 3D back to 2D, since there&#039;s a lot of formations and movement during the performance. This switch doesn&#039;t affect the art style too bad, so it works out. I don&#039;t really mind the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395359">
        input of CGI during the performances. I&#039;m sure it makes the animation process much easier since there&#039;s a lot of vertical movement. Then again, I appreciate dance, animated or not. The animation is well-done too; one scene that made me realize how much I liked the animation was when Futaba was carrying his duffel bags. His little waddle was cute and realistic. <br />
<br />
The camera work/angles are amazing on top of the soundtrack. Sport anime soundtracks hit different. The story itself is so wholesome. Shoutarou Futaba is an incoming high schooler who is inspired by a performance put on by the boys at Ao High School. <br />
<br />
All of the characters are cute. My current favorite is Watari, the green hair dude. He&#039;s always yelling aggressively for seemingly no reason. The VAs for this anime are all amazing as well. AOT Connie&#039;s, Erwin&#039;s and Levi&#039;s VA&#039;s are all in this show, as well as Demon Slayer Zenitsu&#039;s VA. They all contribute to the main cast of the show. Crazy.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m excited for episodes to air :-) I&#039;ll update this review from time to time to see if my general view on this show changes.

    Bakuten!! is a solid 7/10. A good watch covering a niche sport. It&#039;s not very deep and follows a lot of common tropes and stereotypes, but it follows them well and overall this anime is enjoyable to watch. For more detail, please keep reading and see my recommendations at the end. <br />
<br />
When starting Bakuten I was expecting very little but ended up pleasantly surprised. The overall level of this anime ranges from average to good with very little in the way of any major negative points. At most a few personal nitpicks which I will cover. For me the biggest draw is the overall enjoyment.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404367">
        Call me a bit of a sucker, but I do like the stereotypical sports anime. MC is your average (usually teen) Joe Blogs, he sees or encounters a sport that he has never seen before and is blown away by the experience, and the anime follows his journey in learning about and developing his skills for said sport. The story itself is interspersed with supporting characters, a rival character / team and some small personal side stories for said side characters. Bakutenn!! doesn&#039;t deviate far if at all from this. Again, I am a bit of a sucker for this formula. The MC being brand new means you get to learn alongside them as they do, so you do not feel completely left out when they start talking about sports terminologies. As a badminton player I can relate as I&#039;ve had similar experiences and met people with similar experiences within the sport. Some people may not enjoy it as much due to how generic the formula can be, but that is completely understandable. <br />
<br />
The characters themselves are enjoyable but generic. The MC being a blank slate, so you get to insert yourself into their situation. On the team there&#039;s the muscle jock, the calm and quiet guy, the nerdy happy-go-lucky guy, the brooding guy, the aloof guy etc. It doesn&#039;t push the boat out and if you&#039;ve watched other sports anime you&#039;ll see the similarities (and also recognize the voice actors), but as mentioned earlier while it does not push the boat out in both story or characters it uses them well, and they are enjoyable to watch. It&#039;s because the story is a bit generic that I feel safe in writing an early review, as I don&#039;t think it will hinge on the story.<br />
<br />
A major plus for me was just how positive this anime was. The overall level of positivity was refreshing. Maybe it&#039;s been other recent anime I&#039;ve seen, or maybe lockdown is finally getting to me, but the positivity in this anime was infectious. I liked seeing the characters help each other through their situations, and their enjoyment rubbed off on me as I was watching them. There&#039;s no major dramatics or dark twists. It kept things nice, simple and upbeat. A good change of pace for myself. <br />
<br />
The only negatives I could mention, and I&#039;d say they are more personal, would be the sound and art. The sound in terms of the OP and ED and BGM is good, if a bit forgettable. I won&#039;t remember it down the line, but I didn&#039;t mind hearing it. I will say the sounds of the gymnastics floors and crash mats is rather well done in this anime. The art is the only thing I have a gripe and it comes down to the use of 3D. I don&#039;t hate 3D but I like consistency. For the big gymnastic performances it will switch to 3D to show them off. It makes the movement more fluid with longer, continuous scenes, which makes a lot of sense, but I found the change from 2D to 3D a little off-putting myself. Not a major negative and one I was happy to overlook, but just something to keep in mind. <br />
<br />
In summary; I gave Bakutenn!! A solid 7/10. It&#039;s not genre defining, but I think it fits within the genre of niche sports anime very well. An overall enjoying watch and time sink. <br />
<br />
For a further recommendation if you liked Bakutenn!! I have to point you in the direction of Ballroom e Youkoso. Another niche sports anime following ballroom dancing. Following a similar formula as the one I mentioned above but with 24 episodes allowing the characters and story to be a bit more fleshed out. Personally one I prefer more to Bakuten!! in terms of overall quality. <br />
<br />
For a slightly different second recommendation, I will go with Kono Oto Tomare! While this anime is a music focused anime, I find sports anime and music anime hit a lot of the same notes (hah) with their formula.  With Kono having 2 seasons, and a similar number of episodes to Ballroom, it&#039;s a bit more fleshed out. Similar to Bakutenn I enjoyed its positive approach and it was also very fun to watch.<br />
<br />

    I have only watched four episodes of this series so far, and I&#039;ll try not to include any spoilers. This anime is pretty much your typical sports anime, but about rhythmic gymnastics, which is a form of gymnastics that includes dance-like routines. <br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
<br />
The story and setting is fairly typical: the MC becomes interested in rhythmic gymnastics after seeing it for the first time and joins a high school team. In this case, the MC is not a prodigy by any means, but does have some natural talent. In the first four episodes, the other team members become more fleshed out and we can see

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395222">
        steady improvement. Very basic stuff. <br />
<br />
Art: 8/10 <br />
The art and animation of this show is actually very endearing and the cinematography has a relatively unique style. I would rate it an 8.5 or 9 out of 10 just based on the 2D art and animation, but the CG scenes (usually appearing during the gymnastics routines) look more like a 2012 JRPG. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10 <br />
The score is made by the same guy who made the Haikyuu!! score, so it&#039;s pretty good. The sports sounds are also very immersive, like when they jump and hit the mat. It&#039;s satisfying in the same way as the bouncing of a ball or squeaking of shoes in a basketball or volleyball anime. The VAs are actually great; they&#039;ve got a couple from Haikyuu!!, Erwin and Levi from AOT, and a couple other famous VAs. <br />
<br />
Character: 7/10 <br />
The characters are pretty archetypal, similar to Haikyuu!! characters. The MC is a bit more on the unique side, but most of the other characters are just your typical energetic type, cool type, annoying type, delinquent type, etc... Nothing too impressive here, but at least it doesn&#039;t take away from the show. I&#039;m expecting these characters to get some development as well. There are also one or two characters that actually seem pretty interesting in the rival team at the moment. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10 <br />
I am a sucker for sports anime. This anime gives similar vibes to Haikyuu!! and Ballroom e Youkoso, if you enjoyed those. I don&#039;t think its nearly as good as the aforementioned anime, but its enjoyable enough to make me want to keep watching at the very least. <br />
<br />
Overall: 7.5/10 <br />
Whether I think its an 7 or 8 out of 10 will depend on the proceeding episodes. I&#039;m hoping they&#039;re able to create some real tension in the tournament they are currently working towards. The anime has also been focused mostly on the MC&#039;s personal growth, so I&#039;m hoping it becomes more team-oriented from now on (which it seems like it will). <br />
<br />
Overall, I would pretty much only recommend this anime to sports anime fans, if you want to satisfy that craving of competition. If you prefer more serious or plot-heavy shows then this is probably not for you.

    THIS ANIME IS SOOOOO GOOD 10/10 recommend. To the storyline and to the friendships this anime is amazing. <br />
<br />
<br />
the storyline of the anime is amazing and its also enjoyable and wholesome. It kinda gives my haikyuu vibes. At first I wasn&#039;t a big fan of the 3d animation, but honesty has grown on me. The soundtrack is good aswell.One thing that I really liked about Bakuten was the character development and just the characters in general. Each character has their own unique personality. And its funny how they all have conflicting personalities yet their bond is so strong. Overall I would give this anime a

Honestly, I was so surprised by this anime. I&#039;m really not a fan of sports anime, except for Yuri!! On Ice I&#039;ve dropped every single sports anime I started watching. But Bakuten!! really got me! (I actually feel like people who liked YOI for the story/sport might actually really like this anime as well!)<br />
<br />
Though the story isn&#039;t really anything special or different from other sports anime (random guy picks interest in a sport after seeing someone doing it very well), you can&#039;t help but enjoy the whole series. The characters are endearing, each with their different personalities and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397873">
        quirkiness, but their interactions are so cute and hilarious most of the time, you just can&#039;t help but like every one of them, even if they&#039;re from the opposite team. The animation is top tier, I got interested in it when they dropped a video of their routine on the first episode and I got so shocked with how good they used the CGI for presentation parts, the fluidity of movements, the whole fact that they switch from 2D to 3D and back so nicely and in a way it complements the story and doesn&#039;t bother the viewing at all. Even the 2D scenes are extremely well made and so far I don&#039;t have any complaints about flaws in animation or continuity. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack is also something to be talked about, all the songs are really nice and complement the story extremely well, the OP and ED are also no-skips, the opening actually being sung by Centimilimental, the same ones who sang Given opening. <br />
<br />
So far this has been a top tier anime and an extremely pleasant surprise in my sports anime history, the episodes are very well-paced (I especially like the filler episode kinda horror-themed, felt like a nice breather and was so hilarious), you can feel the emotions and conflicts with the characters very closely and, honestly, I had never felt goosebumps while watching a &quot;match/presentation&quot; scene as I did with Bakuten!!, I was super into it and on the edge of my toes thinking about how well they would do in their routine. <br />
<br />
So far, 9 out of 10, but if the other episodes are as well made quality and story-wise as the ones thus far, I might actually change my score to 10!

    &quot;Each laugh takes them higher. Each tear makes them stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another sports show that seems to be in the myriad of promoting the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympics (as any sport in 2021 seems to have been made that way), but nope. To my huge surprise, this show stems from the fact that it&#039;s made as 1 of 3 anime works for Fuji TV&#039;s &quot;Zutto Ouen 2011+10...&quot; project of the devastating Magnitude 9.0~9.1 devastating earthquake and powerful tsunamis that rocked the Tohoku region in northeastern Japan on March 11, 2011. The 3 works: Bakuten!! (set in Miyagi prefecture), Misaki no Mayoiga (set in Iwate prefecture) and Hula

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404322">
        Fulla Dance (set in Fukushima prefecture) are made in tandem to promote tourism through animation. Even though these 3 works are unrelated to each other, it still commemorates the 10th year anniversary of the fateful disaster, and a sign of rememberance of the post-disaster long economic recovery. In this day and age, it&#039;s kinda sad to remember that such an unfortunate disaster of Mother Nature has claimed the lives of thousands, and even if you think of this as a sorta &quot;blatant&quot; way for both Fuji TV, Zexcs and its sponsors to earn money through capitalizing on &quot;death toll&quot; means, there&#039;s no denying that the 2011 Tohoku earthquake has been a huge significant event, that become both global news and with anime fans all around the world to stand united together as one to &quot;Pray for Japan&quot;.<br />
<br />
That said, Bakuten!! (or literally translated as Backflip!!), is IMO, the leaps-and-bounds infinitely better version of MAPPA&#039;s Taisou Samurai which also features gymnastics, paired with Zexcs&#039;s outstanding visuals and animation that easily aligns itself to KyoAni&#039;s &quot;Free!&quot;, while having the all-boys camaraderie that&#039;s akin to Production I.G&#039;s &quot;Haikyuu!!&quot;, all in one dense and tight package. It&#039;s clear that scriptwriter and series composer Toshizou Nemoto has had many shares of the backlash when it comes to his choices of screenplaying anime made over the last 2 decades of his life, and this show definitely reeks from the somewhat sub-standard &quot;newbie enters a sport outta nowhere, gets interested and participates in competitions&quot; trope. It&#039;s only because of Fune wo Amu&#039;s director Toshimasa Kuroyanagi, of his great directing that greatly adds to the charm of more than just watching Bishounens do rhythmic gymnastics, and not just limiting to the backflip. And Backflip!! he did TO THE MAX.<br />
<br />
Since every sports show is always 99% character centric shows (and there are many to cover), let me put it in the best Bishounen pairings possible between friends and rivals of Shoshukan (or Ao High) and Hakumei (or Shiro High) high schools:<br />
- 1st years newbie Futaba Shotaro, with aces Misato Ryouya and Mashiro Tsukiyuki;<br />
- 3rd year team captains Masamune Shichigahama and Tooru Takase (with vice-captain Youjirou Mutsu);<br />
- 3rd year team vice-captain Keisuke Tsukidate and 2nd year Kyouichi Ryuugamori;<br />
- 3rd year team ace Nagayoshi Onagawa and 2nd year Hideo Oominato;<br />
- 2nd year member Koutarou Watari and 1st year Shunsuke Azuma;<br />
- Last but not least, team coaches Shusaku Shida (with manager-cum-relative Asao Kurikoma) and Shuji Mabuchi.<br />
P.S. *psst* Coach Shusaku&#039;s wife IS REAL...?<br />
<br />
I really find it fascinating that instead of just going for characters with different personalities (that will be very difficult to follow), why not create friends-cum-rivals of similar alter egos with the same interests, so that the characters can click with each other well when there&#039;s no rhyme or challenge to do so? This is the sole reason why Bakuten!! works both as a sports and character-centric drama to all the endless hijinks and wack ton of time for a balance between seriousness and cooldown moments. Personally, as much as the serious moments of having to work hard for the typical competitions is a staple, there are some sprinkles of the slice-of-life built in, and this show has more than enough time to give us the chance to learn the characters and their personalities in-depth. Make the fact that rivals each have their own nemesis, yet can commune well with one another, this is some ingenious character writing over here. I still can&#039;t believe that this concept works so great, and wish that other anime would learn from this show in the character development department.<br />
<br />
Of course, every sports show will need a huge boost to shawcase its calibre in the animation department, and Zexcs made sure to crank that up to 11, and truly the studio did wonders to showcase the superb, gorgeously beautiful visuals and 3D (not CG) animation that is truly, madly, deeply, fluid and rock-solid throughout. A proper seasonal anime made (if you don&#039;t count Shadowverse and everything else in-between) in 3 years, and which seemingly no anime project aims to have Zexcs in the name of animation production, this show truly benefits a lot from a company-level project and going all-out with some of the best modern day visuals and animation so cinematically jaw-dropping. Even looking back at Rokuhoudou Yotsuiro Biyori which was made by the same studio exactly 3 years ago, it looks so awfully plain when compared to this show. Seriously though, props and thumbs up to the production team for giving us a visual treat from start to finish.<br />
<br />
The OST is also great too. Centimillimental is back with another OP, and while I initially first struggled with trying to contend a different kind of song when comparing this to the outstanding (and now iconic) Given&#039;s OP (which still rings in my head when I listen to Centimillimental songs on Spotify or YouTube), overtime this song got the better of me, and I learnt to contend with the stylistic differences of both songs to low-key enjoyment. wacci though, it&#039;s been 7 years since Your Lie in April&#039;s 1st ED (I&#039;ll be discounting the Uchi Tama kids show&#039;s OP since that didn&#039;t strike with me well), but dang, even with not much song production going on, to come out with another ED song that still has the band&#039;s signature trademarks, I&#039;m reminded of the former&#039;s ED and how much it amazingly slaps even with the passing of time.<br />
<br />
Bakuten!! (or Backflip!!) is more than just a sports show. It&#039;s one that no doubt promotes tourism (at a time when Gaijins like us can&#039;t even travel to Japan because of COVID), but instead, it also promotes teamwork, camaraderie, friendship, and most importantly: finding your passion in whatever you do to make it work, regardless of the many challenges and circumstances that make or break us. The kids&#039; rhyme of &quot;Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me&quot; easily sums this hidden gem to a T, and enjoy this peaceful, enthusiastic, intense-gripping of a show that&#039;s can be best paraphrased in the way that the humble legend Keanu Reeves says it best (in the now globally famous meme): &quot;You&#039;re breathtaking! YOU&#039;RE ALL BREATHTAKING!&quot;

    A breathtaking and captivating story about a team which consists of idk how many original characters. Their personality is something you&#039;ve never seen before or even felt before. The story just pulls you in and you find yourself trembling the whole week just because of how excited you are for a new episode.<br />
You get hooked on it right in the first episode, when a mindblowing fantastic breathtaking spectacular fascinating CG sets the of bar of your expectations from anime skyhigh and nothing will ever even come close to those three minutes which felt like an eternity ever again. The main character, very innocent and extra

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400171">
        super cute young guy sees that shit too and his mind becomes blank (which can be seen later in the episodes) and from this moment on there are flying birds everywhere with their feathers falling off. The background characters are just as fascinating as main characters in the show, although there are like none. But sometimes when the story takes place in a mall or something you can find some not moving figures which is also magical.

    Having heard the show was about rhythmic gymnastics, I was a bit sceptical on how it would go. I didn&#039;t have any expectations entering the show and was left feeling pretty light hearted. <br />
<br />
I hate to admit it, but Bakuten is just a ball of sport anime tropes and stereotypes. It has everything you can imagine, from the situations right down to the typical characters. That&#039;s not to say it&#039;s not enjoyable, just that it&#039;s not anything new. The only difference is that it tackles a totally different sport. A &quot;fruity&quot; one as some would say. <br />
<br />
The animation is really nice, solid 8, maybe even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404496">
        9. I didn&#039;t notice anything weird about the movements when they&#039;re performing, but maybe that&#039;s just because I&#039;m not good at spotting things like that. The soundtrack is also an 8, I love the OP and ED. The story itself is pretty generic, but still heart-warming. Filled with inspiring moments, competition that have mirror-like personalities to the main cast, injuries etc. it&#039;s what you&#039;d expect of a sports anime. <br />
<br />
The MC is also quite generic compared to most MC&#039;s of sports animes. He&#039;s really nothing special, and pretty average, actually. Then you have the genius best friend, who&#039;s obviously been doing this his whole life. An aggressive/scary teammate, one who&#039;s calm and keeps the captain in check, a competitive captain and another member obsessed with a particular idol(?). No one really sticks out. (Though pretty interesting that some of these personality types were interested in gymnastics, I never would&#039;ve guessed. They&#039;re what you&#039;d expect of other sports teams though) <br />
<br />
But I still enjoyed it. It&#039;s nothing special, hence the 6. I wouldn&#039;t watch it again, but if you&#039;re a fan of the sports genre, I&#039;d recommend this after listing off other sports animes. It&#039;s a change of pace from other sports, that&#039;s for sure. The animation is insane sometimes, and I love the theme of &quot;soaring&quot; and &quot;flying&quot; that they associate with gymnastics. Bakuten definitely has its moments, and for a rhythmic gymnastics anime, it&#039;s not too bad. Overall, I didn&#039;t find this a waste of time and I found myself thoroughly enjoying some parts :)

    Ok listen the ONLY good thing about this anime is the music, because it&#039;s written by Yuki Hayashi, who is an absolute god. And you can just tell that he absolutely loves Rhythm Gymnastics but they really did not deserve such a good OST.<br />
<br />
The characters have no personality and are literally just cardboard cutouts. The main character is like literally any other sports anime protagonist, in that he saw the sport and admired the team and decided that he wanted to do the sport.<br />
<br />
There is literally no flavor to the characters and the story is very standard. Except for episode five, whatever the heck that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403051">
        was.<br />
<br />
The shift into the CGI is jarring and pretty terrible. Maybe I&#039;m just not a fan of the 3D CGI in general, but it&#039;s just..... bad. Their faces look very flat and it&#039;s just not good. The 2D and scenery is pretty, but other than that it&#039;s not great.<br />
<br />
The character designs are also very similar and they all kind of have the same face.<br />
<br />
Honestly I&#039;m very sad because I was very hyped for the anime before it came out, but it just didn&#039;t deliver. The characters fall flat and I don&#039;t feel any connection to them and the story isn&#039;t interesting. Like sure, the characters are pretty and cute but they have no depth and it&#039;s disappointing. <br />
<br />
Good characters can carry a bad plot, but bad characters can&#039;t carry a good plot. And this show has neither good characters nor a good plot. It&#039;s all just very meh and not worth my time. It&#039;s also very disappointing because the cast is AMAZING and I really wanted to like it because there are so many of my favorite seiyuus. But even though they have a great cast, they can&#039;t carry terrible writing.

    Honestly, this show never caught my eye because it involves a sport I wasn&#039;t interested in. I only watched it because I was recommended it. Turns out it wasn&#039;t a bad experience at all.<br />
<br />
Like most sports anime stories the goal for the team is to make it to nationals. Pretty standard story formula. However, this anime focuses more on the characters rather than the plot itself. It explores the reasons why each character is doing artistic gymnastics and their motivations for working so hard. It focuses more on Shoutarou and the ace prodigy, Misato than the rest of the team.<br />
<br />
The scope of the plot is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411785">
        relatively small considering Shoutarou is literally a beginner in rhythmic gymnastics. I had concerns about how the anime was going to pace itself when the main character was a complete beginner but to my surprise, the show manages to do a lot with 12 episodes. Part of the reason why it was able to work with the concept of having a beginner was because it focuses on the characters. The rival team that was introduced definitely was able to flesh out the dynamic of the characters and add different interactions for the characters. Unfortunately, most of the characters on the other team are only slightly developed and don’t add too much to the story. The important ones being the captain of the other team and more importantly the ace, Mashiro serving stronger roles.<br />
<br />
The atmosphere of the story can be described as lighthearted yet perfectly captures important moments where characters can really feel the weight that they carry. <br />
<br />
Characters<br />
This is where the story really shines, it manages to explore and flesh out each character from the team. We learn about their goals and motivation for doing rhythmic gymnastics. We find out that most characters were inspired by other people doing rhythmic gymnastics, making them want to start the sport. While the characters are likable, they don’t differ too much from characters we have already seen before like a dense simple-minded captain, a quiet nerd that is good at studying, a guy that just goes with the flow, and a loud guy. Not to mention that they also have their own individual interests to flesh them out as well. I really liked the dynamic of the character interactions between Shoutarou, Misato, and Mashiro. With Shoutarou and Mashiro being total opposites in terms of experience and Shoutarou and Misato being the opposite in terms of personality.<br />
<br />
I also want to say that food definitely played a big part in this story. The idea of food bringing people together isn’t adding anything new, but it just adds to the sense of bonding as a team and spending time together. Not only can we see them spending time together in practice, but they also spend time outside of practice getting to know each other. This is able to bring them closer as a team and be more realistic.<br />
<br />
The art and animation are nothing special and at times the art can be a bit subpar especially if the characters are further back in a scene. CGI is used for rhythmic gymnastic dance routines because otherwise, that would be too costly to draw by hand. Honestly, I don’t dislike it when the routines were done with CGI. I had to admit that I was drawn in when there was a dance routine on the screen. The CGI does stand out slightly meaning that you can definitely tell that it’s CGI that breaks the immersion of watching the anime. <br />
<br />
The sound doesn’t really stand out in any way and I’m also not the type of person to pay too much attention to soundtracks or opening and endings. The opening was average and nothing too memorable and the same thing could be said about the ending. One thing about the sound that I did notice was when they were doing a dance routine, each time that they landed or tumbled it did add to the experience of watching them dance.<br />
<br />
I also appreciated that the show didn’t rush the story to be a stand-alone series because that would have been a mess. Glad that they&#039;re creating a movie to wrap up the ending of the story.<br />
<br />
A big part of enjoying sports anime is having an interest in the sport that it focuses on. I personally wasn’t going to watch this and I was going to drop it after 3 episodes, but I’m glad I gave it a chance and finished it. It turned out to be a very enjoyable watch that didn&#039;t try to achieve too much. Solid 7/10.<br />

    Overall: 6<br />
I really enjoyed this show, but it&#039;s nothing special. If you&#039;re looking for a nice &#039;lie down and mindlessly watch&#039; kinda anime, I&#039;d really recommend this one. It&#039;s visually appealing and not hard to follow. The reason for my average score is because that&#039;s what it is, average. Let me explain.<br />
<br />
Story: 4<br />
The story is exactly what the synopsis says, and the same overused trope in anime. Student stumbles upon a club, becomes fascinated in it, and joins the club to try to do what they do. They don&#039;t really add much to that basic plot, which makes it repetitive. It&#039;s not inherently bad, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404554">
        it does nothing special, nor tries to. At least not in the story.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The art style itself is also very average. However, it is nicely animated, bringing life into the movement. Typically, the shots show the main group talking to each other, but they&#039;re not animated with one movement. They&#039;re all animated separately with their own seperate actions, which I find nice. The animation really shines when they&#039;re performing. 3D programs are used for the wider shots, but it&#039;s split with 2D animation when character expressions are important.  When animated, It&#039;s very fluid for the budget it was probably given as a seasonal anime.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
I am a huge fan of the op and ed of this show. The op was made by the same band who made much of Given&#039;s music, and I love all of their music. This is no exception. The music perfectly shows the audience how the characters feel when they&#039;re performing. The ed is also very calm and reminds you that this is just a simple, relaxing show.<br />
<br />
Character: 3<br />
They introduce too many characters. The main 6 characters are necessary, even though some of them have little personality. the coach and manager are nice background characters with enough individuality to make you like them. The characters in their rival team are mostly completely unnecessary, with the exception of Mashiro, who has a connection with another character. The entire rival team is just reflections of the main cast, and it&#039;s hard to keep track of everyone. The only characters who are really expanded upon are Futaba and Misato, who have a sweet relationship. The four others in the main team all have one thing (object or activity) that is their personality. It&#039;s extremely flat and unoriginal.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7 <br />
Regardless of the criticism, I enjoyed watching this anime every week. It was a nice way to just lie down and mindlessly watch.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
This anime, as I have stated before, is very average and unoriginal. This isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing, and I am excited to see how the newly announced movie turns out.

    Bakuten!! What a ride, a pleasant one. <br />
<br />
For something so simplistic as its plot focused on rhythmic gymnastics, this show truly conveys a lot of emotions and experiences that are hella enjoyable, and that makes it one of the greatest shows of the season imo. <br />
<br />
The story, as I said, it&#039;s very simplistic yet effective: the rhythmic gymnastics club and their journey to the junior tournament. For the introduction of the club members to their coach and manager- hell, even their rivals; each of our main characters had their own little backstory that added a spark to the story. Certainly, the show focused a lot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404487">
        on those details, like the interactions between characters, their growth, and how to relate to each dynamic. The friendship between the team members and their struggles seemed pretty real, it made me feel the lightness the show&#039;s aesthetic and storytelling had conveyed. I really appreciate how the show was more focused on their character&#039;s development rather than solely just the sport. Also, the show&#039;s sense of humor is very amusing haha I just love the way they carried the whole Mysterious Coach&#039;s Wife and the hide and seek episode.<br />
<br />
There are still some unanswered questions like Misato&#039;s parents or details for the Shiro Highschool Team members but I&#039;m pretty sure that they will eventually have their own lil arc once the movie comes out or even future seasons. <br />
<br />
The art is one of the main reasons why I enjoyed it so much! When I found out that Zexcs was the studio in charge, I couldn&#039;t help but hesitate. They are known for Diabolik Lovers, and I&#039;m pretty sure that is something very overwhelming if you know about the show lol. However, there is undoubtedly a major improvement from DL saga and Bakuten: the character designs, the artstyle, the aesthetic, in general, was a total upgrade and how they decided to implement CGI was pretty satisfying. I guess everyone worries a lot about CGI but in this show is well used. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m still amazed about the panoramics and visual effects for certain moments. From Shotaro&#039;s first impression of his current team to his sensations while doing the handstand with Mashiro, the visuals were almost magical and made me feel chills every time Shotaro discovered something. That also applies to the show&#039;s more sad moments! The setting created for those moments was so well done... I&#039;m still thinking about his conversation with Misato, Misato&#039;s struggle with a certain part of the choreo or Shichigahama&#039;s determination scenes. <br />
<br />
I would like to also give major props to the choreography team! The show couldn&#039;t have been possible without the amazing choreos shown here. Each choreo seemed to fit perfectly with the vibes of each team and that&#039;s a fantastic aspect to remark along with the music. Surely Shiro HS Team had a very spicy performance, one of my favorite routines in my very vast one of anime performances. <br />
<br />
Now, bringing back the characters, I felt really engaged with every single one of them, and it may be due to how each character had a special characteristic in their personalities. Surely, our MC, Shotaro, is an emotional little bean, discovering a whole new world in the field or getting to know his teammates and rivals. How he acted in certain situations and interacted with the cast was so charming... Same for Misato! I&#039;m used to your typical character with a stoic personality or resting bitch face but, somehow, with how cold-minded was Misato, seeing him flustered or nervous about something was very amusing~ I may be biased but the whole show made me appreciate the way characters behaved. <br />
<br />
I would talk about the rest of the characters- For real! Each one of them is special- for a long time but I want to mention two things regarding characters: Mashiro was such a good character, his range from being this cute fluffy boy to a serious and passionate athlete amused me. And lastly... The confrontation in the tournament between both captains... That was so damn attractive and that says a lot. It&#039;s the way each character embraces the positiveness of competition, how their rivalry is healthy, and share the same goals that make these tense moments so good. Not gonna lie, the confrontation made me a big Takase fan, since my boy Shichigahama was already best boy lol <br />
<br />
So, in the end, Bakuten was amazing. I&#039;m pretty sure this show can be considered a comfort one, with how fluffy, funny and relatable it was. I would totally do a rewatch of this show on a very bad day just because of those facts. And you, people, should watch it too! That&#039;s an overall 9 out of 10 and I will probably rate it a perfect 10 if I rewatch this show enough times to convince me that it&#039;s a masterpiece lol

    I had my problems about beggins bakuten!! and I regret it. I&#039;m happy about how this anime wasn&#039;t popular enough to have a fanbase as annoying as SK8 that took down my experience every time I got on twitter.<br />
<br />
With this theme, I was prepared for something full of queerbaiting and shallow sport (which is no demerit to me), however only the second part happened. Of course, no one wanted a anime video lecture about male gymnastics, but it was always a subject that I was interested and followed.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s why disappointed me how easy it was for the protagonist, who was not a genius and had

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404435">
        never practiced the sport before, dominated everything so fast to the point that 12 episodes have already been competing with the boys who have been doing it for years. My thinking is that a baby steps mode would be best for this case, after all it&#039;s not as simple a thing as &quot;tag you&#039;re It&quot;. The short number of episodes ordered gives the need for urgency, but i didn&#039;t buy so well.<br />
<br />
The generic dramas they are inserted are sometimes nebulous and shallow, but they are quick to explain why they are that way. For me the most interesting thing was the teacher who was a talented star thay after an injury finds himself lost in a world where he must live as a normal and almost hopeless person. Just the kind of person he disliked so much, brutal.<br />
<br />
It implies to me how much the boys who make up the team are not even close to having that impact. The bespectacled boy who just nods and talks well about the hot red-haired captain (Free! Mood) is completely forgettable even though he&#039;s been there from the beginning. The green haired boy is a total waste, his mob personality is very funny and I hope he will be exploited in the future. Shotaro is what we call a dreamy protagonist who doesn&#039;t have that much talent, but tries very hard to be excellent, so he can inspire new kids to get into the sport. He&#039;s satisfying. Unlike the team star, he is shallow and predictable like a transparent door. The direction can&#039;t even explain how he is so above average as they say, the only trick used is that horrid white-haired character who appears to be annoying and talented, as we&#039;ve seen in other animes of the genre.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t like to judge with so few episodes, I know that in the future new characters will be developed, but I hope they will be treated in a more intelligent way. I also doesn&#039;t like the animation style they used at the time of the presentations, but it&#039;s very acceptable. The final performance is one of the most beautiful things of the year, with the brawny, sweaty boys glowing in the gym lights after so much battle. Here was managed to convey the feeling of reward for having seen all the episodes, cheering for them fly.<br />
<br />
Keep flying boys, and bringing artistic gymnastics to more boys who might be interested in something so beautiful.

    I really like this anime a lot!! The animation is beautiful and colorful without feeling saturated. The characters are a lot of fun and have great design. The story moves at a quick pace, it doesn’t feel slow but it also gives time for the main character (mostly) to grow. The music compliments every scene. So far, I’ve only seen the first 6 episodes, but the show feels very fresh and light-hearted. You can tell how much care and attention went into every episode and I really love watching every new installment. I truly think it deserves more attention. Hopefully my review will convince someone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399280">
        to at least give the first few episodes a try because this hidden gem shouldn’t be hidden anymore.

    Bakuten, or Backflip!! (we musn&#039;t forget the exclamation marks) was initially just the seasonal sports anime that caught my eye. As a casual sports anime enjoyer, of course I wanted to go check it out. <br />
<br />
Initially, I didn&#039;t have very high expectations for the anime itself, since gymnastics and such don&#039;t have a very good record, but I still wanted to give it a shot anyway. It actually did pass my expectations, and turned out to be a lot better than I first imagined. <br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
Bakuten&#039;s storyline isn&#039;t really anything special in my opinion, boy wants to join a club after seeing one of their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407476">
        performances, the club had limited members, boy joins said club once he transfers to high school and learns the sport. At first, I felt quite bored actually since it was kind of like a template formula sports anime use, especially with the cliche metaphor of the birds &quot;soaring&quot;. However, what makes me give this show a 7 in story was that it was unique in a way where the plot didn&#039;t need a mysterious or sad backstory for the protagonist/s to keep the audience going. It was refreshing to see just the protagonist, Shotaro Futaba, genuinely have a loving and supporting family. He wasn&#039;t this flashy character that had a unique skillset or distinguishing features, and Bakuten handled that type of protagonist well. The show felt down to earth (apart from the extremely fast learning from the protagonist, but that can be ignored) and genuinely felt relaxing to watch. It wasn&#039;t too intense, and that&#039;s what I like about it. <br />
<br />
Art: 9 <br />
The art and animation just felt great. It felt great to finally see this type of anime be animated well, where the choreography could be captured in an apleasing manner for the audience. The art uses bright colours and simplicity which matches the positive tones in the show. The CGI performances for the gymnastics choreography was great, I felt some of the choreography felt limited for each performance therefore not making any of them stand out especially, but that is a minor issue that is outshined by the smooth CGI. <br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
The sound and music was fair, nothing really stood out to me however it wasn&#039;t bad either. I would have liked to see a variety of genres of music for each team that performed, but it&#039;s acceptable. <br />
<br />
Character: 7<br />
The characters in the show don&#039;t get too much development, but the one that I felt got a good amount of attention was the coach. (I&#039;ll be going into minor spoilers in this section of the review). The coach was definitely one of my favourite characters in the show, I found the joke behind his wife pretty funny and his backstory was definitely interesting. I really like how down to earth the coach is, the message being spread that people can 100% change. It feels like this sort of concept isn&#039;t used too often, of course we have Kageyama from Haikyuu, however his character was more focused on changING. The Coach we see in Bakuten has already moved on, and has suffered consequences from his past mistakes. I absolutely love that he then uses his knowledge to teach others and he does care for each of his students. In my opinion, the coach felt like an incredible character, someone who I can say &quot;Yeah, I wish I had a teacher like that&quot;. There were other characters that got some development, however I won&#039;t go through each one. I do wish the two &quot;main characters&quot; got more development, though there will be more content of Bakuten so I hope to see development there. I can see that Bakuten does attempt to develop some characters, and so far they&#039;ve done a good job in making them relatable and realistic. Again, I do want to see the main characters have more gradual development. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
Overall enjoyment is the key to Bakuten. The anime was so refreshing to watch, was down to earth, and conveyed positivity in a sensible, non-dramatic manner. The overall dynamic made me happy to continue watching the show every week. However I&#039;m not quite sure if it would be a bingeworthy show since I watched it weekly, but I did look forward to watching each episode and making me feel happy walking out of it. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Bakuten probably won&#039;t leave a huge impression on me considering the setup of the storyline and the limited focus on the main characters, however I felt good watching it and is worth watching if you enjoy a peaceful yet entertaining watching experience.

    The whole show was stereotypical as it can be, the story was the same as many other sports anime, the characters were the same as many other sports anime, the way of putting the plot was the same as well, This anime was filled with the same plot, story, characters. The MC didn&#039;t have any character and personality in him until the last three episodes, But still, the show was decent and enjoyable was the most part of it, the art and camera angles during their competition were really good and CGI was also decent enough. In the end, I look forward to its season

    I&#039;m a huge fan of sport anime. I&#039;ve watched many great animes, but my favorite so far is Haikyuu!!. I love everything about Haikyuu; the story, the characters, the arts, the OST, the Seiyuus--everything. I don&#039;t know how many times I&#039;ve watched Haikyuu!! from season 1-4 repeatedly, and thanks to Haikyuu!! I start to like volleyball. Just as Haikyuu!!, Bakuten!! gives me the same vibe 😊<br />
<br />
The moment I watched episode 1, I fell in love with Bakuten!!. The art is breathtaking, the story is amazing, the characters are great and unique--I love it. Even I like the random, out of the blue, thriller episode 5

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402954">
        which surprised me when it came out 🤣<br />
More over, Bakuten!! casted top notch Seiyuus, almost all of them are my favorites 🤩<br />
<br />
I must admit, I had no idea about Men&#039;s Rhythmic Gymnastics before I watched Bakuten!!, but now I know this delicately beautiful and strong sport exists 😍<br />
<br />
Bow dow to anime for promoting not well-known sports. As I know Figur Skater from Yuri!! On Ice, I know Men&#039;s Rhythmic Gymnastics from Bakuten!!, and I feel grateful for that--doumo arigatou 🙇🏻‍♀️

    A cute and relaxing cliche.<br />
<br />
Bakuten is everything you need when you want to relax and enjoy all that a teenage sports anime has to offer.<br />
<br />
The story is common but well-developed.<br />
The characters are captivating and have well-crafted stories.<br />
Highlight here for Shida, the coach, and Misato. Their story was the one that held me the most.<br />
<br />
A negative point is that the anime is a bit dragged, especially towards the end. In my opinion he could have ended up with two episodes less.<br />
<br />
In the end, Bakuten is a good anime. Nothing too impressive, but perfect for when you want to laugh and relax with a cute protagonist and
