    Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro... perhaps one of the weirder animes I&#039;ve seen. However, this anime hit my taste buds right on! Honestly, I&#039;m a big fan of detective fictions, main characters that are seen as intelligent, and overall weird motifs and this anime is PERFECT for you if you agree with any of the above. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Overall, the story is enjoyable, and not one second was disappointing. The plot was nothing too intense, so those of you looking for drama might think this is faulty. The plot definitely pretty mild compared to other animes such as Death Note, or Code Geass, but the main idea for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11290">
        each episode really, was to show us one mystery per episode and let us wait for that kick-ass catch phrase &amp;quot;The culprit is... YOU!&amp;quot; Anyways, i find it very hard to be disappointed after each episode because each episode was vacuum packed with great comedy, and  mystery. One flaw I would have to critique on is Neuro&#039;s deduction and concluding was extremely unnatural... Personally I try to solve these mysteries too as i watch along, and you could probably pick out the culprit pretty accurately, but to determine the tricks behind the murders is quite the challenge because the show tends to pass over evidence a bit too fast due to its time limit of 20min per episode. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
I&#039;m usually not too critical when it comes to the art of some anime, but for sure this one stood out. You really don&#039;t appreciate the details of how well this anime was drawn until you go on and move to another anime to watch.. Many of the characters are drawn with a high degree of detail from eyes, hair, and to clothes. Specifically using Neuro as an example, you can see the streaks in his hair, the patterns in his eyes, tiny details like those triangle stuff that are attatched to the ends of his hair :S, and a unique blue suit that pretty much stands out from the typical crowd throughout the show. Another thing that caught my attention was Sasazuka, or Godai&#039;s  eyes, because they were heavily outlined. It pretty much is used for characters to emphasize the &amp;quot;toughness&amp;quot; in their personality.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
I don&#039;t remember any great insert songs in the series really... But notably the opening theme was what caught my attention. They used the song Dirty - Nightmare to open up their series, and the lyrics match quite well to the story. Not to mention it sounds pretty dark, which undoubtedly matches that dark, demonic atmosphere.  Unfortunately, the ending song was not something worth remembering. They used the ending song as an insert for one of the episodes that had to do with one of the characters singing it. Not my taste in music X_X kind of a bad singer too.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Most UNIQUE characters made in combination to create the comedic, yet mysterious  mood throughout the story. Neuro is quite the sadist at times, though you would see this from a very comical perspective rather than a cruel one. Though, from time to time you do see him look pretty creepy with his claws and fangs, or his gigantic bird head &amp;gt;.&amp;gt;... Actually, his comical face creeped me out in the first episode too... But you would notice the irony of it all as you progress through. Yako on the other hand, was kind of boring =/. Well she was average on most parts, but her interesting points were that she was a total pig when it came to food X), and i guess her its also her ability to understand humans and psychology so well. These 2 characters create a great team together, as one person goes and catches the baddies, while one lures them renderless purging full of guilt. I can really go on talking forever about the characters in this anime, but these 2 guys were the key magics.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Definitely enjoyable throughout every episode. Whether it be the really funny episodes, or the really serious episodes. Once again, there was the occasional flaw in logic and deduction you might catch on to if you tried to pay attention and solve the mystery yourself, but most of the time the mysteries were pretty creative and many times made you say &amp;quot;wow! what a crazy method!&amp;quot; For the times where the mysteries kinda sucked, the comedy part suffices. <br />
<br />
Overall: <br />
Overall was worth watching from start to finish. Many of you may question the weirdness while watching first episode, but thats actually the best part about this whole series. The weirdness eventually catches on to you, and when you finish the series it really does make you leave a part of yourself in the anime. The ending suggests possibilities for a sequel, since Neuro has yet to eaten the &amp;quot;ultimate mystery,&amp;quot; and i absolutely cannot wait for season 2 :D<br />

    Story:<br />
Basically a demon detective, Neuro, comes to the human world from hell and teams up with a girl, Yako, whose father was murdered. Basically the story is then done is a mostly episodic manner, that is every episodes, sometimes every 2-3 episodes, are a new case. But as you progress through the cases and the episodes, you witness a lot of growth with Yako and in the end the mystery of her father&#039;s death is obviously resolved. The cases aren&#039;t really always that great and are usually pretty easy in terms of solving and predicting, but there&#039;s some nice ones, and either way, the cases

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4099">
        are still enjoyable. The whole supernatural aspect of it makes it take a different approach than most detective and mystery shows, which I think is good.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The artwork and animation was very nice. The close-ups on Neuro&#039;s eyes  and face were always spectacular because they displayed so much detail, but then there would be other scenes where his face would then have a really simple and comedic look at the right situations, which was good. There&#039;s also some pretty good angles and visual effects to accompany it all.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The OP is a cool song by Nightmare (same band that did 1st Death Note OP,) which I think a lot of people, including myself, enjoyed. The ED was a nice soft song that always ended the episode nicely. The sound effects and background aren&#039;t anything special really, but by no means bad. That goes for the voice acting as well.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Neuro is an awesome character...just had to say that first. Anyway, yeah, I think the cast is pretty good. You got this demon detective straight out of hell that uses these cool techniques (777 tools of the underworld) and is pretty damn strong, and a school girl whose greatest love is eating and food and isn&#039;t really a good detective at all, yet gains fame as a detective, however she understands human ways very well, which makes her a good asset to Neuro. Then there&#039;s the other characters like Godai, Sasazuka, Ishigaki, who all are pretty likable. And then the line-up of criminals and murderers, particularly Sai, who I won&#039;t mention much on because I don&#039;t wanna spoil anything.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Well, like I said, the murder cases aren&#039;t that great, but the supernatural element of it makes the cases still pretty enjoyable. There&#039;s some good action here and there, mostly fighting between Neuro and Sai. There&#039;s plenty of blood to go around, so if you particularly like that, this won&#039;t let you down. And lastly, it is also quite humorous at times, especially when Neuro purposely degenerates Yako and Godai.

    I can&#039;t see why people would think this show is bad at all.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s animated by the same studio that did Death Note, it&#039;s incredibly unique, and it&#039;s fun to watch.<br />
<br />
The manga volumes I have read are incredibly random, but incredibly entertaining and genius, and although the Anime is quite dumbed down and rearranged, there have been no fillers; Although the story has been changed quite a bit.<br />
<br />
The show has sadly been one of the series to not be subbed regularly, I was glad when catchphrase picked it up and they did it well, but then they slowed down. Now I&#039;m watching Ainex&#039;s releases and they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2563">
        do a really good job, like they do with Persona -Trinity Soul- and how they did with Night Wizard. They are usually the first one out and have good visual quality and subbing accuracy.<br />
<br />
I would recommend anybody who likes Anime to at least try this series, I know I usually overrate what I watch, but this series definitely deserves a 9.

        Overall Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro was enjoyable, however it wasn&#039;t what I was expecting.The tags being Comedy, Demons, and mystery along with the synopsis saying things like &quot;As a demon, he must not make his presence noticed by the humans as it is the law in the human world&quot; and &quot; a demon who feeds on mysteries and puzzles, who comes to the human world to feast on the mysteries offered by humans who release negative energy from their planned crimes&quot;, we can expect a detective show with some demon shenanigans. That premise sounded interesting to me so I went in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204194">
        with some interest.<br />
<br />
    The show starts off with my expectations being filled. There is a demon, there is some comedy and there is some mysteries to solve. However the quality of all this is very mediocre. First the detective act feels like its for the younger crowd. They serve the mystery up for you within the first few minutes. Even a 5 year old would be able to tell you who the murderer is. You then spend the rest of the show watching as Neuro looks cool and finds proof to wrap up the case and then listen to some lame morale speech from Yako before finding out it indeed was the person they told you it would be. This continues through the entire series only being interrupted by a real mystery in the form of a serial killer named Sai. I had hoped Sai would bring around a change in pace to the show but it did not and honestly felt like wasted potential. That being said it wasn&#039;t terrible but if your looking for something like Death Note or Code Geass you will be very disappointed.<br />
<br />
    The demon who cant show himself to humans sounded like an interesting premise, however it seems like they eventually stop caring about that angle. I guess they rely on a few scenes to show that what the viewer sees nobody else in the room can see. The comedy was also limited. It mostly revolved around Neuro picking on Yako and Godai and making a strange face of some kind. I laughed a few times but mostly it only got a smile or two out of me. This all of course wouldn&#039;t really matter if the show did something well but it seems to stretch itself too far and comes up short everywhere. The characters could have turned this around as they constantly interact with one another and also all seem to have their own backstory which would lead to some interesting interpersonal issues and conversation. However they do not go into much detail with the characters either. Yako who is the main character has probably the most depth out of everyone and all the viewer knows about her is that she is in school, her father was murdered and that she eats a lot. This isn&#039;t a terrible thing though, shallow characters have their own charm and allow this show not to be too serious and feel more like a slice of life story. <br />
<br />
    Overall the show is just average in every aspect. The art is dated, not bad, but dated. The music was alright but nothing I need to listen to again. You wont be solving mysteries or even laughing though hopefully you will be able to smile and enjoy the guessing game. The characters have their own charms but lack depth which just makes the show feel more relaxed but they interrupt this several times with more serious issues. There is much that could have been done to turn this show from just an ok experience to a great one and that truly makes me sad, but I did enjoy the show and am glad to have finished it, wish it wasn&#039;t 25 episodes though. Watch this if you have some time and don&#039;t mind it being aimed at the younger crowd.

    Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro is a 25-episode anime based on the ongoing manga with the same name. It&#039;s original run lasted between October 2nd, 2007 and the 25th of March, 2008 (on Japanese television, of course).<br />
<br />
The genres include: shounen, supernatural, comedy, drama and mystery.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s get started then.<br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
The story of Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro is very original. A demon from hell (Nougami Neuro) who feeds on riddles and mysteries has run out of food, since he ate all the mysteries in hell. Therefore, he decides to leave hell and travels to the human world. There he finds Katsuragi Yako, who is deeply saddened by her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4132">
        father&#039;s death. Neuro forces the poor girl to become a detective, then he disguises himself as her assistant, so that he can get easy access to his food. Through the series,we follow Neuro and Yako as they solve various cases, sometimes with the help of Godai, who has underground connections. Most of these are pretty random, but there are some very nice plot-twists too.<br />
<br />
Animation: 9<br />
Madhouse (who also made Death Note and Black Lagoon) simply never fails to deliver. I have never seen a series done by Madhouse lacking in the animation department. Neuro will not make you disappointed, either. It has a very unique style of animation and the character designs are awesome.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
The OP of Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro is &amp;quot;DIRTY&amp;quot; by Nightmare. It&#039;s a, to say the least, special song which actually fits very nice with the feeling of the anime. The ED is &amp;quot;Kodoku no Hikari&amp;quot; by Kagami Seira. It&#039;s not a bad song, but it doesn&#039;t catch my attention like the OP does. The BGM is good and well-executed to fi with the series, which it does.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
This is where this series truly stands out. Almost all characters are very thought out and interesting. Of course, it&#039;s the main character that will get most of the praise here. Nougami Neuro, a demon from the underworld, is one of the best protagonists i have ever come across. He is fun to watch with his superior intellect and inhuman powers. His &amp;quot;777 tools of hell&amp;quot; is probably the weirdest arsenal of weapons I&#039;ve ever seen. Katsuragi Yako acts as a sort of cover for Neuro, as the detective, but she gets some great development throughout the series. Godai is the ex-mob with many useful connections. He is the jack of all trades for &amp;quot;Katsuragi&#039;s detective office&amp;quot;. There are of course more characters, but these three will be enough for this time.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
As you might have understood from the score, I enjoyed this anime a lot. Even the random cases are very enjoyable. The main plot that gets thrown in later in the series is very exiting and interesting, although I have to say that the ending was pretty predictable.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro is an easy series to overlook, but it is in my opinion one of the best series from the fall anime season of -07. This is definitely not a show to miss, although I can&#039;t promise you you&#039;ll like it as much as I did.<br />
<br />
I hope you found my review helpful, and if you didn&#039;t please tell me why, so I can improve myself until next time.

    I started watching this anime only because I had nothing else to do. But now that I&#039;ve finished it, I am SO happy that I decided to see it.  Frankly, this anime left me begging for more. My only complaint with it is that I wish it was a bit longer. Its totally unique and different from any anime that I have ever seen and is truly one of a kind. If you want an anime that is funny, mysterious, cunning and just a little weird all in one, then this is exactly what you are looking for.<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
The plot isnt too intense, and does

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193542">
        allow for some comedy. The entire story is very episodic in nature, and develops very nicely before building pressure at the end. Most of the cases are, unrelated, but as the story progresses, everything starts to come together into one fantastic plot. <br />
ART:<br />
The art in this anime was rather colorful and detailed. Madhouse did a great job with this anime. it has a different structure when the air is funny and lighthearted and another type when the aura was more serious. I ESPECIALLY loved when they zone in on Neuro&#039;s demonic features. <br />
SOUND:<br />
Although I did like the opening and the way it was somewhat cynical and fit into the anime, I didn&#039;t find the OST&#039;s all that memorable. The ending was nice too, and served as a contrast to the opening.<br />
CHARACTER:<br />
These fantastic bunch of characters are what REALLY make you fall in love with this anime. Nougami Neuro, one of the the protagonists, is one of the most amazing characters I have seen, and also one of my favorite. He is just unique in every way, and he is a huge part of what makes this anime so good. Katsuragi Yako is what seems like your boring old highschool girl that is just there for lame comic relief or something, but as the anime progresses you can see that she is SO much more than that. Honestly she has some of the best character developments in the entire anime.<br />
 A demon that came from hell to eat mysteries, and a highschool girl who wants to find her father&#039;s murderer. They make the perfect team to catch baddies.<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
I can tell you that there was not a single moment in this anime that made me feel bored or unsatisfied. I loved it down to its very core!<br />
OVERALL:<br />
 I totally recommend this anime to anyone interested in this genre. You will not regret it! <br />

Story: &amp;quot;So here we are with another detective story&amp;quot; is what I&#039;d like to say, but that would be a lie. Not all detective stories have an uberly powerful demon came from hell in search of mysteries because it has eaten all of the mysteries in hell. The story progresses in episodic nature, slowly developing in the way, and finally climaxing in the last few episodes. The ending wasn&#039;t the best i imagined (left many open doors,) but it allows a continuation for the series, so it&#039;s fine by me. <br />
10/10<br />
<br />
Art: Have you noticed how black, gray and white were the primary colors

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6738">
        in Death Note. Do you remember how well it went with the theme. Well, Neuro offers the exact opposite choice of coloring and still ends up being as wonderful as DN. It is colorful enough to slow down my computer on the &amp;quot;eating&amp;quot; scenes. Note that they are both made by Madhouse. Other than colors, the characters are well and uniquely (that a word?) drawn. What you would expect from Madhouse.<br />
10/10<br />
<br />
Sound: One sad thing about Neuro is that it&#039;s OST didn&#039;t really appeal me. Sure, it&#039;s not all bad, but I don&#039;t recall any piece of OST from the anime, which doesn&#039;t usually happen. Well, I also didn&#039;t notice any lack of music, so it&#039;s all well. Seiyuu cast is mid-strong, not the best, but good. Neuro&#039;s seiyuu (Takehito Koyasu) is also one of my favourite seiyuus. OP is good, but as usual, ED is definitely not good.<br />
7/10<br />
<br />
Characters: Neuro, Neuro, Neuro. He solely can be the reason to watch this anime. Only one word can describe him: unique. Matsuei Yuusei (the mangaka) really hit the jackpot with Neuro, he is simply awesome. On to the other &amp;quot;sidekicks,&amp;quot; your average &amp;quot;living&amp;quot; hair Akane-chan, the oh-so-badass Godai, and your &amp;quot;typical&amp;quot; high school girl whom father is dead and is allied with a mystery-eating demon from hell, Katsuragi Yoko. Oh, wait.<br />
10/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Every once in a while, there comes an anime which leaves me in despair because it has finished and I can&#039;t see anymore of it. It continues until I sleep. Well, Neuro is one of them. My first reaction to the last episode was &amp;quot;wow.&amp;quot; But then, on a second thought, it became &amp;quot;Wait a min. Did Neuro just end. Noooooooo! T_T Neuroooooo!&amp;quot; Seriously, we need a second season. It managed to get me laugh quite a few of times, and it was able get serious when it needed to be. I don&#039;t usually watch episodic animes, but this exception proved to be fairly entertaining. <br />
10/10<br />
<br />
Overall: As a fan of detective stories and have seen/read many things about them, I can say that this is one of my favourites. Artisticly drawn with an interesting plot and unique characters, Neuro will never disappoint you. Go watch it, even if it&#039;s just to get a glimpse of Neuro&#039;s personality.<br />
10/10

    Story: Very original. I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anything like it before. Sure, there&amp;rsquo;s lots of anime that have a demon and average human as the main characters, but in Neuro it&amp;rsquo;s done in a unique way. Plus, the mysteries aren&amp;rsquo;t just solved -- they&amp;rsquo;re consumed. With each progressive episode, the mysteries get more complex and violent -- and so does the relationship between Neuro and Yako. There&amp;rsquo;s a good balance of seriousness and comedy.<br />
<br />
Animation: It&amp;rsquo;s nothing special, but not a totally horrible mess either. It may fluctuate from high quality to low quality a few times per episode, but it&amp;rsquo;s not distracting.<br />
<br />
Sound: The opening and ending

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4101">
        are catchy and fitting. The background music fits well within the situations.<br />
<br />
Characters: Here&amp;rsquo;s where I&amp;rsquo;m split on how to score. On the one hand, there are the awesome, unique, well-developed characters: Yako, Neuro, and Godai (Neuro&amp;rsquo;s other assistant). On the other hand, there are some seriously useless and irrelevant characters. The two policemen are so boring that I can&amp;rsquo;t even bother to remember their names. They&amp;rsquo;re the stereotypical &amp;ldquo;one serious, one silly&amp;rdquo; team. The most useless of all however is Akane-chan. She&amp;rsquo;s a living braid of hair that&amp;rsquo;s attached to a corpse in the wall who acts as a secretary. Yeah, I don&amp;rsquo;t get it either.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I found every episode to be interesting, never boring. The one minor annoyance I had was with the same two lines being in every single episode (&amp;ldquo;The culprit is you!&amp;rdquo; [Yako] and &amp;ldquo;This mystery is on the tip of my tongue&amp;rdquo; [Neuro]), but I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s a necessary component of the show. And of course the whole character thing I mentioned.

    This anime is not really easy to describe. At first you might think that it&#039;s just poor man&#039;s detective Conan, but I would describe it as a mix of Conan and Soul Eater.<br />
<br />
I started watching this anime by an accident, because i really liked the opening by Nightmare, the ending is boring though. The soundtrack is full of great and memorable tracks, but voice acting doesn&#039;t stand out except Neuro&#039;s. Now the animation seems weird and out of place at times, it&#039;s above average.<br />
<br />
Yako Katsuragi is a generic and useless main character and the only interesting thing about her is her appetite which puts Luffy,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review78093">
        Lina Inverse and Chouji to shame.<br />
Now Neuro, that&#039;s some really awesome character, I already mentioned his voice and laughs, (he has the same VA as Excalibur!) but the best thing is that he&#039;s a sadistic psycho demon who eats people&#039;s souls full of mysteries and has over 777 awesome demonic weapons. Seriously, he&#039;s just a badass and rises my overall score by at least 2 points. Shinobu Godai is just an assistant who gets angry very quckly and drinks lot of beer. And Akane-chan? That&#039;s the weirdest anime character I&#039;ve ever seen, she&#039;s just a ponytail!<br />
Eishi Sasazuka is a slightly apathetic but really cool and smart character and his assistant Jun Ishigaki is like a dumber copy of Matsuda from Death Note and then there&#039;s Yuuya Higuchi, a genius hacker who plays more important role in one later story arc.<br />
And the main villain is the &quot;Phantom Thief&quot; Sai who in fact, DOESN&#039;T steal, but murders people and puts them in a red box, he&#039;s a fairly decent villain, but he&#039;is nothing compared to Neuro.<br />
Other than them, most characters don&#039;t appear for longer than one episode or Arc, so I won&#039;t bother with describing them.<br />
<br />
The bad parts are the story. The story is weak and episodic and is set into mysteries where the culprit is alway obvious from the beginning. But because of simplicity there are a few plot holes. The first episodes may be a pain to watch, so if you take this as a mystery show it sucks (go watch Conan or even CSI instead), BUT as a shounen, it easily stands out among other fighting anime because it tries to be different and when it gets less episodic in the end it even becomes slightly exciting, even though the conclusion is open. There are also some really funny slapstick moments. Overall it is fun if you don&#039;t care about bad mysteries and don&#039;t take it too seriously.<br />
<br />
So should you watch it? Only if you&#039;re into shounen with some mysteries, otherwise you&#039;ll get bored.<br />
<br />
Overall: a bit strong 7,2

    Well.. So far I completed only 16 episode from all 25, but I just have to write this review, &#039;cause:<br />
<br />
I just can&#039;t understand Why so great scores for that anime? I see here only 8, 8, 8 even 10? In mine opinion it not deserve even mere 6.<br />
well- The cases about that demon detective - Nougami Neuro sometimes are not too bad. This anime is pretty light also, but I find the humor in here just horrible and it ruin my mood (of course- that have a reflection of my scores for that anime). If this anime was made more serious or.. with other kind

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22524">
        of humour I think maybe it will be in my favourite... but that way.. just watching it- I&#039;m feeling stupid.<br />
<br />
Everytime I start to watch new story (or new episode) of Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro and became curious of the end at that story Neuro do something stupid to Yako (For example: it is quite possible every human to die when his neck is twisted from Nero over  an angle of  360 degrees, but Nero do things like that to Yako in every single episode and she is always alive..Is that suppose to be a joke or something?).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Story (7?):<br />
The story is about some demon who live in human world as a detective for the sake of searcing misteries whom to eat (&#039;cause that&#039;s what he eat). He made a detective teem with Yako (a human girl which father was murdered- case closed as suicide) and a former yakuza called Godai. Yako join the team for the sake of resolving her father mistery. Together with Neuro they search for misteries to resolve. They are also 2 police detectives in that story and one Phantom Thief Sai. From that of point of view the story is almost pretty good.. <br />
<br />
BUT:<br />
<br />
If that story was made for kids I think- that will explain some of the reiterations (like- the same end to every story when Neuro always win and eat his new mistery), but again... what kind of humour is that? Is it good for kids to think that they can twist somebodyelse&#039;s neck without any consequence?<br />
<br />
If the story is made for someone more mature- what&#039;s with that so predictable ending?<br />
<br />
<br />
For whom actually was made this?<br />
Maybe only for people whom like the supernatural elements more than everything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Art (6):<br />
The art was pretty normal. Nothing more, nothing less.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound (8):<br />
I actually liked all songs in it.<br />
The sound was normal too.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Character (6):<br />
The characters are unique for human-world, but.. for anime.. I really don&#039;t know.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (1):<br />
If you have time to waste and nothing to do.. and if you like light stories- watch it! There is blood in these stories, but they are not hard to be watched. <br />
<br />
Like I said STUPID HUMOUR and stupid tools with whom the main hero operate, predictable end of every story.<br />
<br />

    Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro is equal to or even better than Case Closed. I was really thrilled when I read this, since I consider CC to be one of the best (if it isn&#039;t THE best) mystery anime out there. It&#039;s better than CC, they said. You&#039;ll love it, they said. Sadly this joke of a mystery anime failed to meet my expectations. Instead, it stumbled to it, all in its drunken glory, expecting me to accept and love this series. <br />
If you&#039;re a fan of mystery and you&#039;re planning to watch this, then don&#039;t. As a mystery lover myself, the biggest mistake the anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220335">
        made is that the clues and hints aren&#039;t always revealed to the audience before it is solved. Every time the method of killing and motive are revealed, there are always elements that weren&#039;t shown, making me feel like the author always pulled these murder stories from his behind. <br />
The following is a more in-depth review. <br />
*contains minor spoilers*<br />
<br />
Story: 2     As a &quot;mystery&quot; anime, MTNN is episodic, with three or four arcs that span two or more episodes. The episodic stories were absolutely terrible; like I mentioned above, sufficient clues aren&#039;t shown to the audience, making it impossible for them to immerse themselves into solving the mysteries. Also, only one or two possible suspects are shown each episode, and two minutes (or less) after they are introduced, the culprit is so glaringly obvious, I&#039;m wondering why the author even bothered putting up a pretense of investigation. If they&#039;d shown more possible suspects, perhaps the anime would&#039;ve improved. Furthermore, for adult people who were capable of comiting crimes that allow them to escape suspicion, they were irritatingly childish. Most of the culprits have Chuunibyou; their motives were selfish, irrational, and utterly stupid. Everytime, they are revealed for their crimes, their physical apperance hange to reflect their personalities. The ridiculous design of these changes only serve to reinforce that the character has Chuunibyou, and to make me cringe big time. The only exception to this is HAL, and even then his assigned motive is unoriginal. Another thing the author seems to enjoy using is the &quot;777 Tools of the Demon World.&quot; Since the possibilities are pretty large, he can make one tool up on the spot to move the story along. What&#039;s even more pathetic is that most of the time, there isn&#039;t even any reason at all why a tool should be used, but in the end, it is used. Despite all these faults, the mystery behind the father&#039;s death, which was teased throughout the series, was one of the things that made me hope that this anime would eventually improve. Two words: It. Didn&#039;t.<br />
*Another thing that really got on my nerves was the animation when they&#039;re about to reveal the culprit. It would&#039;ve been amazing as something to increase the tension if there are lots of suspects and you don&#039;t know who the murderer is. In this anime, it just felt like a mockery of the mystery genre.*<br />
<br />
Art: 5     The animation was pretty bland; it was neither great nor was it bad. At first, I was amused by Neuro&#039;s derpface, which was one of the reason&#039;s I held any hope at all. It got old three episodes in. Action scenes were pretty decent though, as expected of Madhouse.<br />
<br />
Sound: 2     The OP and ED were surprisingly bland and average for an anime which Madhouse created. Even its OST was bland at best. At worst, the soundtrack feels like it came from a 90&#039;s cop drama, and I felt that it did not suit MTNN at all.<br />
<br />
Characters: 2    It wouldn&#039;t be a stretch to call all the characters in MTNN (except Neuro, surprisingly, and Sasazuki) cliched and oblivious. We have our cliched MC, the pure girl who wants to see good in others and likes to interrupt at crucial points of the story. We have our cliched, tough guy sidekick, who&#039;s actually really kind. And lastly we have our cliched assistant, who&#039;s airheaded, is an idiot, and despite all odds has a job as an inspector/police officer. Sasazuki, despite being an inspector, did not express any suspicions that Neuro was the true detective, since he explains all the methods of killing, even if Nougami and the MC had no chances to discuss. Sasazuki didn&#039;t even suspect him one bit when it was revealed (for an instant, which was then forgotten) that all the suspects said that Neuro was a demon. That&#039;s all you really need to know about these guys. They&#039;re very one dimensional, and they don&#039;t get any character development. Even the MC remained static throughout the show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1     From the beginning to the end of an episode, all I want to do is sleep. During the end, all I want to do is cringe while slowly gouging out my eyes to clean them.<br />
<br />
Overall: I hate this anime.<br />

    Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro is not a bad series.  It is also not one of the best series out there either.<br />
In a lot of ways, I view this series on an equal footing with Jigoku Shoujo.  Some episodes are extraordinarily good while other episodes lack.  <br />
Some of the mysteries in the series early on, much like Jigoku Shoujo&#039;s first cases, are very bland.  Once you dive into the main plot, the series does start to liven up.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, it is the characters that make this series and not the story so much.  The story comes as a sort of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3409">
        context to show off Neuro and to engage in the very dark comedy that literally drowns this series.<br />
I feel too that this series deviates from the &#039;demon&#039; norm in that Neuro doesn&#039;t suddenly become touchy feely, like so many of the demons seem to do in series.  Instead, Neuro is Neuro.  He seems to have a solid personality that doesn&#039;t shake at the whims of the storyteller and, thus, seems more like a true being than merely a puppet of the story.<br />
<br />
I think my favorite aspect is that the characters do grow and evolve as the series goes on.  There is a gradual building of layers that happens and, over time, begins to change the characters themselves.  <br />
I won&#039;t go into details but, suffice to say, if you dropped this series early into it, pick it up and try again.  You might be pleasantly surprised by the changes in the characters themselves!

    **Some Spoilers but not enough to ruin the show***<br />
<br />
This anime is a very interesting one. To properly watch this anime and enjoy it, one needs to start at around episode 5 skip 6 then continue to episode 7 on, and probably skip episode 15 as well. Nothing will be missed since this anime has a different mystery every episode. <br />
<br />
The show is set up in a very Scooby-Doo mystery like fashion. You only meet around two or three characters per episode and the first person you meet is always the villain. However, the show is somewhat dark in the aspect that someone is always killed.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185088">
        Sometimes youcharacter Sai is involved. Who is also voiced by one of my favorite voice actors, Romi Park (voice of Edward Elric and Toushirou Hitsugaya). Sai is a very interesting character and fun one to watch. His &quot;mystery&quot; also one of the most interesting. <br />
<br />
Often times the show take its too far when Neuro abuses Yako, some of the jokes seem very forced, and at the end, you do feel a little unsatisfie. Sometimes you might find yourself not rooting for the main character( but above i have mentioned to skip those episodes above). But the ideas are fun and the animation is great. You leave with a better impression of the show than began. <br />
<br />
I would recommend watching this during a rainy day or when you run out of animes to watch. <br />
<br />
Overall 7

    I thoroughly enjoyed all 25 episodes of this anime. The mystery solving and murder cases reminded me of the Detective Conan series- even the story structure! Maybe that&#039;s why I enjoyed watching it~<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
For me, the story was great! It wasn&#039;t the most original plot.. However, it was interesting and kept me on my toes the whole time. To be honest, the set up is quite similar to Detective Conan. Neuro is like Conan- the person who&#039;s actually solving all the cases. Then there&#039;s Yako who&#039;s like Mouri Kogoro- the person who&#039;s taking credit for the cases. Finally, there&#039;s Sai who&#039;s practically Kaitou Kid. However,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171983">
        Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro takes on a more supernatural theme. Also, despite the similar roles, the characters have completely different personalities.<br />
<br />
*I only used Detective Conan to compare, because it&#039;s a more well-known anime. If you&#039;re worried it&#039;s too similar, don&#039;t be. They&#039;re completely different genres of anime! This anime won&#039;t disappoint!!<br />
<br />
P.S. I REALLY wish a season 2 is made! That last episode was such a cliffhanger. I want to know what happens next!!<br />
P.P.S. The fact that there was no romance disappointed me :( This is really just my personal opinion- I like a little bit of romance in all anime!<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The art was pretty good. It wasn&#039;t overly pretty with massive eyes and such. The art style fits very well with the story and each character&#039;s personality. Personally, I really liked the comic-style drawings during the funny scenes!! Yako&#039;s expressions are hilarious~<br />
<br />
ALSO, is it just me or did Neuro seem kind of attractive at times HAHAHA (maybe it&#039;s just me sorry)<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
Nothing really special to comment. The sound was good! The sound effects really added to the atmosphere, whether it be intensity, suspense or humour.<br />
Also, a round of applause for the voice actors~ Each voice really suited the character!<br />
<br />
Character: 7<br />
The characters were all really likeable- whether they were good or bad. The main characters did lack a bit of originality though. Yako somehow reminded me of Mako (Kill La Kill) and Sasazuka reminded me of Zero (Vampire Knight). Also, Neuro&#039;s personality (minus the demon and magic) is a typical sadistic personality that can be found from a lot of other anime. I&#039;m not so sure if that all made sense.<br />
However, while watching the anime, I was continuously reminded of characters from other anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
Each and every episode is worth watching. They&#039;re all action packed and make you think.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
Have a go and watch the anime! If you like mystery, action and supernatural, then go for it!

    Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro- A series about a girl who lost her father in a murder, or as the police report it, a suicide. This girl is Yako. She is one of the main characters in this series.<br />
Story- The story is very unique, though it gets a little repetitive. The story has it&#039;s twists and it&#039;s comedy moments, along with it&#039;s depressing moments. In the beginning, it&#039;s hard to keep up with because it starts further along in the series, and jumps back a few times to show the father&#039;s murder and to show where Yako met another main character. Besides a few flaws like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5324">
        those, the series was interesting, it really makes you think in a few scenes. And it&#039;s touching.<br />
Art- The art isn&#039;t the best, but it&#039;s good. It would&#039;ve been better if the art wasn&#039;t as &#039;pointy&#039;; a little more curvy. Theres too many sharp corners in the art. It could&#039;ve probably looked a little better if it was smoother, and a little rounder.<br />
Characters- I personally loved the characters. There&#039;s no special attributes to them, that&#039;s what makes them so special. They&#039;re like typical people, except Neuro, and the main antagonist.<br />
Enjoyment- I really enjoyed this series. Probably because I&#039;m the kind of person who likes mystery/comedy/action animes, and this is one of them. It was a very good run.<br />
Overall- I give the show a 8.7/10 because of the small problems with the story and art, otherwise it would have been a 10.

    To be honest, I didn&#039;t really think this would be a good anime, but, man was I wrong.  A demon that eats mysteries?  It sounds weird, but, wow, you have to give it a chance.  This show is really interesting despite being a detective-solving-mysteries type of anime (which isn&#039;t normally my thing).  It is REALLY unique<br />
<br />
Story~<br />
This anime is about a bird demon named Neuro who leaves the demon world  and enters Earth in search of more mysteries to eat.  To him, mysteries are like food so, he has to keep eating them until he finds the ultimate mystery. 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14835">
        He already ate all the mysteries in Hell DX...ya, poor Neuro.  Anyways, he meets a girl named Yako whose father was brutally murdered.  She wants to find the &quot;mystery&quot; as to how he died because everyone thinks it was a suicide even though she knows there was no way he could&#039;ve commited suicide.  Neuro senses this and appears on the wall in her room out of no where.  He asks her if she wants to uncover the mystery, she says yes, then he basically makes her his slave.  She serves Neuro and in his place, becomes a famous detective.  Neuro, being a demon and all, wouldn&#039;t want to blow his cover as a demon now would he?  Anyways, this story gets really interesting and, really, GIVE IT A CHANCE.  <br />
Art~<br />
This art is above average especially with drawing Neuro.  He has gorgeous colors in his hair, and his eyes especially are extremely detailed.<br />
Sound~<br />
The sound is pretty good having it&#039;s ups and downs.  The songs are nice and overall, nothing is unbearable.  <br />
Character~<br />
 The characters develop well especially Yako.  She goes from being extremely dependent on Neuro, to actually becoming independent.  By the end of the series, she is actually able to help Neuro and doesn&#039;t act completely like a puppet.<br />
Enjoyment~<br />
This anime was very enjoyable and even the fillers weren&#039;t boring.  The originality and crazyness was a good refresher after seeing so many cliche animes. =_=<br />
Overall~<br />
Overall, I did like Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro quite a lot.

    This series is something different...<br />
One of those rare series&#039;s that comes along once in a while and manages to entertain without relying on the same old acceptable writing tool -  infact, it actually turn the conventional up-side-down.<br />
How often do we have:<br />
- Comic violence dished out on a female by a male? <br />
Pretty much never, but we do within this<br />
- How often is  comic violence nessessary to a plot? <br />
Rarely - yet in this case, it is very nessessary (training from hell)<br />
- An anime that doesn&#039;t hype up sexualisation to keep the viewers interested?<br />
Rarely, yet within this series, there&#039;s - no ecchi and ecchi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review46033">
        related missunderstanding, no romance in general actually and no drilling into the viewers heads that &#039;This character is attractive!&#039; - characters are respected for their acheivements and actions; such as the beautiful idol who has managed to sell 3 billion records going further into the &#039;unconventional&#039;; the two key mains in the series are; a very petite school girl with short hair and a well dressed, uncharming guy who litterally has two unpleasant faces.<br />
<br />
Story...<br />
A demon named Neuro has left Hell and came to Earth in order to seek out &#039;myseries&#039; - to be more specific, the evil entent behind secretive offenders, as this &#039;negitive engergy&#039; is his source of food.<br />
He selects a schoolgirl named Yako, who&#039;s dad as just died under mysterious circumstances to be his assistant, as he picks up on her drive to get to the bottom of her &#039;mystery&#039; - he&#039;s basically just using her and her vunerable position.<br />
From then on, the series is a combination of comedy and seriousness; some horror and quirky comedy with character development and plot progression threwout (litterally, each episode); characters &#039;learning&#039; new things and becomeing wise is a key component within this story - nothing is insignificant.<br />
<br />
Art...<br />
Very pleasant; nice and colourful, changing sceneries, abstract, darkness when needed and neon lighting at times.<br />
<br />
Characters...<br />
Not the usual type. <br />
We have a troll as the main who is known for obscure acts of sadism, though he&#039;s actually on the planet for selfish, his agenda isn&#039;t &#039;do as much harm as possible&#039; and infact, his presence proves beneifical to the public.<br />
We have a teen girl who has been threw a recent tradgedy, yet is suprisingly optimistic; a possitive person with her head screwed on right; she&#039;s accepts her new lifestyle, she&#039;s egar to learn and can be quite fearless; her relationship with the above seems to be vary from; partner, to friend, to student to hostage.<br />
These two (above) are the basis on the series and what makes the &#039;character&#039; aspect stand out.<br />
The two of them are accompanied by a irate yakuza guy who is pretty much, like the feamle lead, in a hostage situation.<br />
We also have a cool, calm police officer and his bubbeling, newbie young partner.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment...<br />
Very funny - Scooby Doo style mysteries; the best part is waiting to find out who the offender is and hearing the explianation - the offenders in this are truely bonkers.<br />
When serious - As stated, we find out that pretty much everything that happens is improtiant; from the comical tourture, to the &#039;horror&#039; rich tourture dished out on the badies.<br />
<br />
Overall...<br />
Very balanced and possibly, one of the few anime&#039;s out there that could be ranked &#039;unique&#039;.<br />
This is worth watching even if you have read the anime, if you have not read the anime, that&#039;s worth reading too, as the two actually complement eachother - though the anime has a &#039;Geko ending&#039;, the ending is still, on a whole, good, whereas there are enough slight (not drastic, but slight) changes to justify starting both from scratch - neither should appear boring.

    Right off the bat you should know the anime doesn&#039;t cover the full series but is the anime worthy of a gateway into its manga? From the author of Assassination Classroom, Neuro: Supernatural Detective follows the episodic lifestyle of Yako; a girl who is accompanied by a demon from hell, Neuro. Each episode deals with murder cases where Neuro solves the case in order to fulfill his hunger for mysteries. As an added bonus, most murderers transform into demons representing their ugly personality. <br />
<br />
Most of the anime is just this but manages to make some appeals. For instance, the anime took some liberties in rewriting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review139387">
        events of the manga to serve as a better conclusion. (from what I read the changes were better in the anime)<br />
<br />
This show is hit or miss in terms of adaptation as the manga later becomes more battle focused with the occasional mysteries, however what this series offers is surrealist horror &amp; a unique lead. Nuero as a character is quite charming as he is selfish &amp; vicious to the point where a friend of mine described Nuero as a &quot;Shonen Alucard&quot;. His presence alone holds the show along with the various monstrous murders that occur. <br />
<br />
While it is a detective based show, the focus aren&#039;t the mysteries but the horror found within them.  Each case brings a creepy tone aided by the much later violent scenes in the series when the antagonist Sai is introduced. One of the downsides of this anime are its supporting cast as they can come off as rather bland. Thankfully the main duo of Yato &amp; Neuro make the show work. Mr.FalconnPunch996 recommended me this series &amp; I personally liked it as it presented a rather disturbing viewpoint of the world. I really wished the anime adapted more if its chapters. The show&#039;s repetitive but if you want to see something horror based give this series a try. Just be sure to jump to the manga afterwards.

                                      Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro <br />
<br />
It is an anime produced by Madhouse that aired from October 2, 2007 until March 25, 2008. It has as genres, Mystery, Comedy, Demons, Supernatural and Shounen.<br />
<br />
Story: <br />
Being an anime of related genres, like Mystery, Comedy, Demons, Supernatural and Shounen, is VERY unique. Basically, the story revolves around two main characters, Katsuragi Yako, a high school girl who starts getting excited about solving mysteries (in Anime, later

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295398">
        she begins to be recognized as &quot;The Female High School Detective&quot;) and Nougami Neuro, a DETECTIVE demon from hell. The story of the two begins with Yako&#039;s encounter with Neuro, the moment Yako sees his father dead in his room, his father&#039;s case seems unsolvable and without proving that the police accuse Yako&#039;s father of suicide, so Yako thinks IMPROVABLE the suicide of his father, Neuro appears and speaks says he is a DETECTIVE from hell who can help you find a solution to your father&#039;s case, then the &quot;journey&quot; of the two detectives begins.<br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
So the characters in Anime are COMPLETELY COOL, OMG!, all are incredible, extremely funny, and extremely WELL explored.(I will focus on the two main characters as they are the ones I liked the most).<br />
<br />
Nougami Neuro: Nougami Neuro: An extremely talented, sadistic, funny and a little scary detective. Even Neuro being a demon, his looks and clothes are extremely incredible, his personality has given me lots of laughter and moments of fun. One of my favorite characters among all Animes<br />
<br />
Katsuragi Yako: Ah, what to talk about Yako-san, an extremely funny and cute character. So her relationship with Neuro is extremely well done in the anime course, and my God, she&#039;s really cool and has a fascinating personality. It will surely stay somewhere in my heart.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
Well directed by Hiroshi Koujinaq and produced by Madhouse, Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro is an extremely captivating and interesting Anime to watch. I&#039;m watching him on vacation, as I have more time left to amuse myself watching Animes, Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro appeared, and I do not regret to having started to watch, is an extremely good Anime and I recommend to everyone who has curiosity in animes of this genre . <br />
It is one of my personal FAVORITES.

    Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Easy to review.<br />
<br />
Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro = Weirdly amazing detective show!!<br />
<br />
Demons, girls, murders, etc etc. The usual for a detective show.<br />
<br />
But what goes on in the show is amazing. Plus the opening song is amazing~ Nightmare - Dirty. Song fit the show soooo perfectly.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a really good Detective anime, this will be a great watch for you~<br />
<br />
Again. This show is barely known amoungst people, yet still amazing~<br />
<br />
Please watch it, and enjoy~
