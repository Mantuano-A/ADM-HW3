    To be honest, this movie was disappointing to me. The fights were not that good, the villain is kinda sturdy, and as usual, always have to show other students of 1-A whether it&#039;s essential or not. It was just an attempt to get money from children who want to see their heroes no matter what. And that black costume... Man, it was the only thing that was great from the movie and it was seen literally 1 minute screen time. (Second is that Bakugou spinning thing, I guess. <br />
Bottom line, If you really like MHA, you &quot;may&quot; enjoy it. But for the mediocre fans, I&#039;d

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414392">

    This movie was boringly average. It felt like I was in the cinema for hours, stuck in a time chamber that slowed downtime were a 1 minute felt like 10. The animation, story, characters, voice acting, and pacing were all average or below. It&#039;s just odd because the last movie suffered from none of those problems. <br />
<br />
I think there were times when the animation did something unique with extremely long shot animation but even then half the time it didn&#039;t feel like polished animation. If it wasn&#039;t for those parts the film would probably be a 3/10 instead of a 5. Just disappointing overall.

    *SPOILER-FREE REVIEW*<br />
I just want to say, first of all, watching this in the cinema is 10 times better than at home. This is going to be an unpopular opinion but, I really enjoyed this film. It felt kind of James Bond-like somehow. The fight scenes looked great and kept me hooked throughout. The story was solid and didn&#039;t feel like any parts were pointless. The addition of the rest of the class in some parts of the film seemed forced. I liked the villain and his motives made a good reason for their actions, but there could have been more focus on their backstory in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422606">
        some way. It didn&#039;t get boring at all, I was enjoying it that much that I waited until I was literally about to wet myself to go to the toilet. There were no parts in the film that dragged on. The art was definitely move quality and looked great in my opinion. The sound was as good as you can get with anime to be honest, same quality as the rest of the My Hero Academia series. The costumes were very cool but got at most a minute of screen time which I thought was stupid. Why were they wearing them in the first place if they were going to stop using them 5 minutes into the film?<br />
Anyway, I enjoyed the film and would definitely recommend watching it to anyone who likes the series as a whole.

    Incredibly boring… I found myself slouching over in my seat just waiting for some scenes to end. After such a slow season I expected a little bit more from the movie, but it seemed to have dragged out just as slowly. The plot became predictable right from the start, the score was incredibly underwhelming, the fight scenes felt long and visually dull. The last few fights were the only entertaining parts of the movie which was incredibly disappointing since they only lasted a few minutes towards the end. The lack of detail in each scene just created such a lazy tone to the movie.<br />
<br />
I still

    *REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS*<br />
<br />
Hey all, thank you for reading this being my first review here on MAL. <br />
<br />
First off, let me begin with what I enjoyed  about this movie. First things first, I loved the fight scenes in the third act of the movie. Todoroki, Bakugo and Midoriya each have their own fight at the end of the film and I found watching those to be extremely entertaining and well choreographed. However, this alone was not enough to save the movie in my eyes.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem I have is with the story. It is generic, bland, and uninteresting with a premise that COULD have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422777">
        been very interesting. As I watched this movie I felt like I had already seen this movie before. Also, the movie was marketed as taking place all over the world. However, the only place that matters is the country where Deku, Bakugo, and Shoto are. Everyone else is kinda pointless in this film. Sure they have some stuff to do at the end of the film but its ultimately the main 3 at the end of the film working together to Phantom Menace the whole situation. I think the story fails most largely in not really incorporating the other members of class 1-A at other locations across the world. Wouldn&#039;t it have been awesome and intense if each location had a specific job to do, and the heroes could only win if everyone successfully completed their task? I believe that would have been way more interesting than what we got. <br />
<br />
Another thing that I found disappointing was how they dealt with Midoriya being falsely accused as a mass murderer. HE ONLY ENCOUNTERS THE LAW ONCE IN THE MOVIE. Yes, he is on the run for most of the film but it doesn&#039;t feel like it since he never encounters any authority figures. Also, the writing was lazy with the whole framing. There was never even any evidence that was used against Midoriya. The only reason why it happened was because &quot;oh, bad guys infiltrated the police so we don&#039;t need to write in any evidence against Deku&quot;. To me, that is bull shit and lazy writing. If they wanted to make the film more compelling, lean into that more and make us truly feel like Deku was actually in trouble. <br />
<br />
Also, those badass suits they used in the marketing were only in the first minute of the film. WTF is with that???<br />
<br />
Summary: Fighting was good and well choreographed. Story was a mess. 5/10.

    I don&#039;t think I&#039;m in the wrong for comparing this film to Hero&#039;s rising and other pieces of work bones have done. Hero&#039;s rising was a fantastic movie, containing fantastic art, fights, b plots, and an overall decent story arc. Hero&#039;s mission though falls short in all of these categories. The art was good, bones have shown they can do much, much better, but it was good. There were several fights where the animation quality took SUCH A DIP mid fight for no reason, I couldn&#039;t tell you where the budget truly went on this film, considering its my hero, and demon slayer just grossed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422697">
        so much, you think they would pour loads into the budget and try make something fantastic, but even the big final fight had stupid choreography and animation. The story was just uninteresting, generic main villain AND side , who was under developed so i grew no feelings towards, which is a shame because even the side villains/henchmen had decent potential. I didn&#039;t think any character introduced was particularly interesting, just a very bland safe characters, the main one i felt was very Hawks inspired, so its probably just for overall fan appeal. Every B plot was bad or under developed, as in the last 2 films, Todoroki and bakugo have a separate big fight from Midoria, they were just not good, and there was even clips of every other classmate in some sort of battle, but all under developed, all with lack lustier choreography.<br />
<br />
and a little side note, the music was so good in Hero&#039;s rising, I&#039;d even say amazing, you say run is literally the motivational music meme in the anime community right now, and it did not hit home anywhere near as much as before, i didn&#039;t even take notice of it to be honest, maybe i need a second watch, but i guess its hard to strike gold twice, would of just been nice for this to be an OVERALL improvement to the second film<br />
<br />
Give it a watch if you want, its got zero story relevance, the fights aren&#039;t all that crazy (Although a bit darker for MHA, which is a nice change), and you&#039;d probably find more enjoyment out of just watching a whole other anime tbh, I find it worse to watch something mediocre more than anything.

    Nothing about this movie or its story makes any kind of sense and it&#039;s full of cheesy recycled boring tropes, themes, massive ozone-sized plot holes, and plot armor. <br />
<br />
* Why are the bad guys with quirks so strong and just what the actual fuck is their quirk abilities, I saw the movie and I still don&#039;t know.<br />
<br />
* How does the big bad know who Deku&#039;s friends are and can pinpoint their locations across the planet?<br />
 <br />
*How do the rest of the all might know that Deku is fighting to stop the bad event at the end of the movie if he hasn&#039;t had any communication

        with him?<br />
<br />
Can we get one Anime movie by the way that doesn&#039;t use excessive amounts of CGI by the way? <br />
<br />
Definitely not worth the price of admission, do yourself a favor and just wait to watch it when it comes out online.<br />
<br />
In one word the movie was Mediocre<br />
<br />

    My Hero Academia: World Heroes’ Mission is very similar to the previous two movies. As in, I could sum it up by “pretty good plot up until an asinine climax”. However, this climax didn’t feel stupidly over-the-top enough to offset the rest of the movie, so I think it’s better than Two Heroes. HOWEVER, it still really focuses hard on The Main Three (Midoriya, Bakugo, and Todoroki). I like how Hero Academia at least tries to make all of Class A relevant and you can tell they tried a little here, but the effort falls completely flat and puts it behind Heroes Rising personally.<br />
<br />
But most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review423159">
        importantly: Do you need to watch Season 5 to watch this? I don’t think so. If you’re planning on watching it already then obviously do that first, but it follows the movies’ trend on being non-canon more than enough. Midoriya has a new One For All move that’s introduced in the first half of Season 5, but the movie doesn’t necessarily highlight it in a way that would leave you confused. Todoroki also has some new moves, but I doubt you’d even notice.<br />
<br />
I’m torn on the movie’s antagonist group: Humarise. On one hand, their scariness is shown off very well right off the bat thanks to a pretty gruesome scene. Their belief that quirks will become so convoluted that they’ll become a real problem is in-line with how the series looks at the nature of heroes from alternate perspectives — which you may or may not like. In this case, I think the base idea is worth looking into…but the movie instead focuses more on the very extreme “genocide” part of their plan. <br />
<br />
The weirdest part about Humarise is how their influence is never properly explained. Normally this isn’t a problem, but the majority of the movie’s plot — Deku and Rody being on the run — relies on it to be convincing. At the same time, it’s not that hard to put aside. Even if the reason for Deku and Rody bonding is flimsy, I found that chunk of the movie to be pleasant. I like Rody as a character since he clashes with Deku’s personality and ideals enough to make their relationship interesting without clashing so much that it’s overbearing. His bird, Pino, was an entirely unnecessary annoyance though.<br />
<br />
The namesake of the movie — all of the heroes we met so far splitting up to oversee the safety of multiple regions of the world — was extremely underplayed for being the namesake of the movie. As mentioned, this movie is a Midoriya, Bakugo, and Todoroki movie. It’s actually mostly about Midoriya which is fine (this series IS his story after all), but when the other two prominently show up I can’t help but roll my eyes. To be fair, the teams worldwide weren’t up to much anyways so giving them more screentime would’ve worked against the movie. It only existed to present Humarise as a worldwide threat. So ultimately, its execution felt half-baked and unnecessary.<br />
<br />
The climax of the movie is thankfully pretty tame this time. There’s no big CG monster or anything. Heck, the fight with the Big Bad is actually pretty interesting with its pacing and theming. But it does suffer from the Musou game problem: the protagonists just mowing down a bunch of mooks without taking damage themselves. This is all while the “camera” swings around so you can’t actually see anything. It also throws Bakugo and Todoroki to the side, which had me wondering why they were even injected there in the first place.<br />
<br />
World Heroes’ Mission is a pretty tame, enjoyable movie. Its plot doesn’t reach the heights of intrigue that the anime has and it might not entirely fit together at times, but it doesn’t do anything too stupid or annoying that took me out of it. <br />

    Ah, My Hero Academia. Depending on what year you asked someone you&#039;d get varying answers of how good this show is. If you asked someone in 2017 about MHA, they would tell you it&#039;s one of the best shows out. If you ask in 2021, they will tell you it&#039;s mid garbage. Why is this? Well, many theories come to my mind. The first one is pretty simple, it got popular. People don&#039;t like it when a show becomes more popular than their favorite show or a show they prefer over it. So what do they do? Shit on it till it becomes &quot;mid.&quot; Every

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422978">
        anime that shoots up in popularity eventually has a &quot;mid&quot; phase to cancel out it&#039;s success because we all know success is something no one can have anymore in 2021. So now MHA is in a much more sorry state than it was in 2017-2018 when it was booming. Now with the question, is it because My Hero actually got worse or are people just sheep and like to have the mainstream opinions just to fit in? That&#039;s an answer for you to decide. People only started hating My Hero when it became a trend to. And now any content the show pulls out is neglected as a cash grab and pointless. It&#039;s quite pathetic tbh. Because imo, My Hero is and has been the best new gen show since 2017 and nothing as come close to it. Now in 2021, that kind of opinion would send you to the looney house and it&#039;s difficult to express it. My Hero has constantly pumped out quality content and has flowed its story for over 100 episodes without many hiccups. Bone&#039;s adaptation of the manga is amazing and one of the few shows where you can say both the manga and anime are high quality. And the movies they put out have god tier animation which can entertain anyone. It&#039;s just hard to ignore My Hero&#039;s success and it&#039;s almost objectively the best new gen simply from sales. World Heroes&#039; Mission doesn&#039;t take the back seat either and delivers eye candy that will have you on the edge of your seat for hours. The story was fine but it&#039;s a filler movie so I didn&#039;t expect it to be a Steven King novel anyways. The other reviews here are stabbing its story and idk what they expected from a filler movie. The cast is the same as they&#039;ve always been and the villain has a super cool power. Overall, this movie did what it was supposed to do, entertain. As to why people expected the next Dune level of writing I&#039;ll never understand but hey, sheep will be sheep eh? I hope to see My Hero gain back the respect it deserves but as of now, its bound to the fate of being a successful show, a mass of haters.

    [SPOILER-FREE REVIEW]<br />
<br />
Once a massive fan, I have to admit that my love for My Hero Academia tapered off after seasons 4-5. Because of this, I was content waiting for the movie to be released, but I ended up at the theater anyway...<br />
<br />
I&#039;m so glad I went. I had NO idea how much I would enjoy this. I left the theater in a daze, with my love for the series reignited in a way I didn&#039;t think possible.<br />
<br />
World Heroes&#039; Mission reminded me why I became a big fan of the series in the first place. The characters, story, and soundtrack created something worthy of a 10

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422976">
        from me. I know it sounds like high praise, but I mean it, and I enjoyed it enough to write it a review, which isn&#039;t something I do often.<br />
<br />
[STORY:] The trailer gives you a fairly good idea of what to expect. I really enjoyed the whole aspect of a cult-like group being against quirks, and it was great to see the heroes against a new roster of threats/foes. Nothing about the movie felt rushed to me; everything fit just right, and the pacing was perfectly done.<br />
<br />
[ART/ANIMATION:] Fantastic. The fluidness in some of the fight scenes (which were AWESOME, by the way) was absolutely incredible. Again, nothing was rushed here -- you can tell a lot of heart and soul went into these scenes. The fights themselves lasted long enough to really pull you in, and the stakes couldn&#039;t have been higher. There were a few times where I wanted to whisper something to my sister, but I couldn&#039;t tear my eyes away from the screen. <br />
<br />
[SOUND] They included an original song during a rather wholesome montage, which was one of my favorite moments in the film. I believe some of the track is new, but you will also recognize songs from the series itself. The way they included them, and the moments they included them in feel very nostalgic. Great soundtrack all around.<br />
<br />
[CHARACTERS] This movie focuses mostly on Midoriya, Bakugo, Shoto, and a new character, Rody. The amount of screen time we get with Midoriya really fleshes out his character more; we get to see him working in a totally new environment, interacting with someone other than his classmates, all while facing challenges he hasn&#039;t faced before. The &#039;new big three&#039; really get a lot of cool scenes throughout the film, especially near the end. As for the new guy? I thought I&#039;d be indifferent toward Rody, but I ended up loving him. He fits into the story seamlessly, almost as if he&#039;s always meant to be there. I enjoyed all of his scenes greatly, and consider him one of the better MHA characters...and also one of my personal favorites.<br />
<br />
[ENJOYMENT] What else can I say without spoiling it? I enjoyed this movie wholeheartedly. It made me feel a wide range of emotions, which is something I don&#039;t experience very often, and I got goosebumps/chills multiple times throughout the film. I understand MHA is met with a mixed reception, but even if you were feeling a little disenchanted with the series like I was, please give Wolrd Heroes&#039; Mission a chance. I have a feeling you&#039;ll be pleasantly surprised.

    Im not a big fan mha but a movie is a movie, i expect too notch animation, good sound quality, and a decent story. In this case the animation and character designed looked similar to a season budget and not a movie budget. The characters them sleves were boring and any comedy were mostly childish skits like farting or someone face planting. The stroy was honestly worse than average it waa just really bad. Tbe definition of plot armor/the power of freindship. I was really disappointed in all honesty and for the first time in my life I actually fell asleep during the middle of

    As a lover of the My Hero Academia series who&#039;s caught up on the manga and anime, the movie was a little disappointing to me.<br />
<br />
The story, while not exactly boring, was in the end underwhelming and kind of forgettable to me. Especially looking back at Heroes Rising, which I believe is the best of the 3 current movies (Not saying too much though, as all the movies are kind of forgettable. Though I cried to the second movie lol). A movie that was started by a misunderstanding and a backstory that was &quot;whatever&quot; so to say. This was another case of a villain whose backstory

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422629">
        and cause for starting this whole thing was really average and &quot;mediocre&quot;. I didn&#039;t care enough for why he started this, as he was so bland of a villain, that it didn&#039;t matter. (That&#039;s to be expected though, can&#039;t develop a villain in an 1 hour and 44 minutes unless done correctly). There is also the appearance and backstory of Rory Soul, the deuteragonist of this movie. While Rory is a decent character, his personality and backstory are nothing special even with his relevancy to the plot. He&#039;s just your normal, everyday, movie original character.<br />
<br />
What &quot;carried&quot; this movie to me was the art and sound, as the action scenes were very (and I mean VERY) well animated. Though just like the plot, they were kind of underwhelming as I personally didn&#039;t get goosebumps, pumped up, or immersed because of them at all. They were just really &quot;flashy&quot; and &quot;shiny&quot; (Not a bad thing at all though. As I said, they were animated extremely well, probably the best I&#039;ve seen of all MHA action scenes). This obviously showed where the budget for season 5 could&#039;ve potentially been placed if the movie wasn&#039;t made.(Though the animation for season 5 wasn&#039;t even that bad, I believe people were nitpicking too much about it.)<br />
<br />
Another thing to watch out for is, if you&#039;re a fan of most (if not all) of Class-1A, be prepared to be &quot;disappointed&quot;. Most of the focus this time around was on Rory Soul (Movie original), and the big three of Deku , Todoroki , and Bakugo with occasional appearances from other members of Class-1A plus pro heroes. Some of Class-1A actually appear just once or twice, with some not even fighting at all.<br />
<br />
One thing I will say is that If there is a 4DX showing for you like there was for me, I believe the movie should be watched in 4DX, as it was actually kind of cool to experience with the fight scenes with my chair moving around, mist and wind being shot in my face, etc. Something that was really unique and different.<br />
<br />
Besides that, the movie wasn&#039;t personally my cup of tea. As said, the 4DX and action scenes were the only thing that carried it for me due and prevent me from rating the movie 3 or 4 due to a very &quot;mid&quot; plot and forgettable villain. As I sit here typing this review, honestly I&#039;ve already forgotten most things about the movie (that I just finished seeing 2 hours ago at the time of typing this up lol) since it wasn&#039;t that great in my book. I still recommend going out and seeing it if you&#039;re a fan of the series. Just be warned, it won&#039;t bring too much to you if you&#039;re a seasoned veteran of the series like me.<br />
<br />
Also, for those who ended up enjoying the movie, I&#039;m really glad you did!! :) (As I&#039;m just one person, so take my &quot;review&quot; with a grain of salt. I still love My Hero Academia a lot)

    To be frank, I&#039;m only writing this comment because of the criticism of the Sound and Art/Animation. The story was pretty basic with all your shounen troupes in it so the criticism toward that was fair and justified. But the animation and sound design were actually amazing. This was by far some of the best animation i&#039;ve seen in the last decade and in my opinion was even better then Demon Slayer, One aspect I think Demon slayer has over My hero in terms of animation was the Moving background did look kinda awkward and outta place then Demon Slayer&#039;s art did but nonetheless My

    For me I really enjoyed the film it kepted me engaged and the fights were amazing and I thought the plot was really interesting for average or mediocre I guess they would say lower but if you a manga ready or a big fan you will love it it wasn’t as say impactful or emotional as the 2nd movie but it is still good I think people are slamming it bc one of there not good/ not that interested in MHA but also are still annoyed at how season 5 was handled witch to some extent is fair but don’t take it out on the

    This movie was catered more towards a younger audience for sure (10-14 year olds) give or take while star lighting the heroes most recognized: Deku, Todoroki and Bakugo.<br />
<br />
To sum up about the art and sound:<br />
<br />
 If you want to see the other heroes in action sorry to say. Most of the movie just had explosions and barely any combat visible. The opening of the heroes was really nice but other than that, the animation went downhill as there were some parts where the characters were intentionally partially animated or poorly animated. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t speak for the subbed version but holy crap I was so taken

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422836">
        aback from Todoroki&#039;s english VA and not in a good way.<br />
<br />
There was some music in which I absolutely enjoyed and will be adding to my playlist.<br />
<br />
To sum up about the storyline:<br />
The only good thing about the movie&#039;s was Deku and Rody&#039;s relationship although I disliked Rody initially. <br />
This cult thing really could&#039;ve had potential with the villain but he was just so overpowered and creepy to begin with. In beginning you have people screaming, and more screaming, Bakugo and Todoroki didn&#039;t do anything until the very end of the movie to help Deku out. Also wtf happened to the archer who was part of the cult, I still have no clue what happened to her or what she contributed other than throwing arrows at Deku.<br />
<br />
Anyways thats my review

    I went into this movie with high expectations considering how much I liked the last two movies. And honestly felt let down. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s bad, but it feels a bit basic. Like a by-the-numbers anime spin-off movie.<br />
I did really like Rory as a character, and his little arc was satisfying.<br />
I think the villain being the head of an anti-quirk cult had the potential to be very interesting. But not a ton of focus was put onto it.<br />
Despite being called &quot;world heroes mission&quot;, we don&#039;t get to see what&#039;s going on much apart from a bit of the country it takes place in. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review423573">
        was thinking this was going to be some sort of globe-trotting mission, or that we were going to get more focus on the other groups acting around the world. But it is very Deku-centric. Even Bakugou and Todoroki get sidelined, apart from getting one fight each.<br />
The animation also feels sub-par for a film budget. Not bad or hard to look at, but some of the action scenes just look unfinished. Apart from the final battle.

    When something says &quot;World&quot; most people&#039;s expectations are probably that of something grand in scale or more important. This movie more or less uses it as window dressing and is at times too busy being something else entirely. <br />
<br />
Based on the big Shonen Jump series, My Hero Academia, comes its third theatrical outing. And from the title, World Heroes Mission, one would assume it should be more global in scale... thats not really the case for the most part.<br />
The main plot is set around a mysterious terrorist organization named &quot;Humarise&quot; with plans to rid the world of the series staple ability &quot;Quirks&quot; and their users

          <span style="display: none;" id="review423198">
        with the use of bombs set up around the world. The main trio from the series, Izuku Midoriya, Katsuki Bakugo, and Shoto Todoroki come along with their classmates, divided into teams with other professional heroes from both their home in Japan and around the globe to stop Humarise. However, Midoriya and the movies original main character, Rody Soul, get caught up into an incident that the police of the country of Otheon declare Midoriya a criminal! <br />
<br />
Said incident, where briefcases get swapped, where I believe even the script of the movie gets swapped, as instead of a world sprawling action rescue mission, we mostly get a second act that goes about as a buddy roadtrip with Midoriya and Rody. And there&#039;s nothing wrong with that, I personally find it does the original character alot of service. Roy is a very entertaining character and even endearing, a very expressive person with a cute little bird mascot like being called Pino. But it does come at a cost of anything substantial for the &quot;world&quot; part of the movie.<br />
Every once in a while we get to see the other heroes in action, including alot of the cast from the series, Ochaco, Froppy, Fatgum, Endeavor, Hawks, etc and they and their scenes are entirely just for action set pieces, not even anything for the movie exclusive heroes (Including a paper thin Pharoah looking guy, I really wanted to know more about him, but got nothing).<br />
Same can be said about the villains too. I don&#039;t if I just didn&#039;t pay attention enough or something, but if it wasn&#039;t for this nice little booklet I got at the theater, I wouldn&#039;t even have known any names whatsoever expect for the main villain, but honestly most of the villains might have been left entirely nameless cause there&#039;s no development for them at all, Rody got all of that, even Bakugo and Todoroki get get nothing except fights. <br />
<br />
At the very least the movie treats you to very spectacular action scenes, not too many down time moments for the first and third acts of the film. Personally I found that Bakugos fight in the third was pretty brutal, I halfway expected him to get help midway through, while Todoroki doesn&#039;t really have anything different to display from what has been shown in the anime and manga. And Midoriyas fight was, to put it as basic as I can, rubber banding himself at the main villain. But yeah, the animation was pretty top notch for the majority of the film, with a very fun and entertaining chase scene at the beginning. <br />
<br />
But I really have to put more into how disappointed I was with the set up. There was so much with Rody and the fictional city of Otheon and despite how much I liked Rody, there was nothing substantial from the rest of the world or other original heroes and villains that I have to wonder why was the movie even called &quot;World Heroes Mission?&quot;<br />
Even Midoriya was pretty flat and bland in this movie.<br />
At least to go alot with the animation, the music was pretty good, though mostly slight remixes of themes from the anime (Yes, You Say Run is played in the final fight too), and I personally saw the English dub, for anyone like myself that enjoys the dub, its well done here too. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
+ Good Animation<br />
+ Good action scenes, especially Bakugos fight and the first acts chase scene.<br />
+ Rody Soul is very enjoyable character that&#039;s easy to care about.<br />
- Doesn&#039;t live up to the title, almost feels misleading.<br />
- Villains are basically nameless nobodies to get beaten up.<br />
- Original world heroes get nothing in this movie.<br />
- Everyone that wasn&#039;t Rody was either just there for action scenes or don&#039;t get any development.<br />
<br />

    This is the worst Hero Aca movie. That&#039;s not much of a bold statement since there are only three, and if I claimed it was the worst movie of the year, it wouldn&#039;t do much causes this year has been pretty good for movies.<br />
<br />
to preface this, I&#039;m not a fan of the series anymore. I had dropped off after season 4 for a variety of reasons. The reason I actually came to this movie was I was doing one of my mates a solid and going with them.<br />
<br />
I actually was hoping I might enjoy this film in the same way I enjoyed the second. I&#039;d

          <span style="display: none;" id="review423166">
        even consider the second film better than the franchise it&#039;s a part of.<br />
<br />
this will have some spoilers later on, but let&#039;s be honest, most people are coming for the action scenes and animation. So we&#039;ll cover that first.<br />
<br />
Outside of fights, the animation is fine, it has it&#039;s moments. Meanwhile the fights are really fluid, which sounds great, and it should be, but it&#039;s so focused on fluidity that scenes start to lose impact. There are several moments where it can be difficult to tell what&#039;s going on, because everything is going so fast, and focused on individual actions rather than show the battles in a way that let&#039;s you follow them(sometimes it does, but it does have this issue a LOT of the time)<br />
<br />
Another problem is the lack of tension. These fights have plenty of moments where you think &quot;yep, they&#039;re dead,&quot;, which honestly feels like the studio is compensating for the fact that the fights have no buildup. Fights just happen with random antagonists that show up, get defeated and disappear.<br />
<br />
This is an obvious issue. Most shonen movies, even the bad ones, have set antagonists, rivals for the characters, so in the final act when these rivals are fought and beaten, there&#039;s hype behind the battles, even when the rivalries are bad, at least there&#039;s something. There are no rivals, and then I just don&#039;t care.<br />
<br />
This creates another problem as well, as spoilers, but the villains are supposed to be an anti-quirk cult, yet so many of their members have quirks. if there were only a few, then it would be fine, I can suspend my disbelief for 2 or 3, but not 10+ to the point where several  handfuls are just faceless goons.<br />
<br />
They could&#039;ve given the villains advanced technology and just 2 or 3 quirk characters instead of so many quirk users. It would make sense for them to have technology since they&#039;ve been preparing this plan for such a long time.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s even worse when, and the film doesn&#039;t even hide this(though you might think it did), but the leader of this world wide, anti-quirk cult has a quirk! It&#039;s like if in Korra Book one, Amon was completely open about being a water bender. I thought blue guy had face paint, but no, he just has a quirk, and it shatters any sense of immersion.<br />
<br />
To be fair, the plot doesn&#039;t have much immersion anyway. A cult this powerful should&#039;ve been mentioned in the series beforehand. Both the other movies had excuses for why their plots were separate, placing themselves on islands, but this is a cult on par with the catholic church.<br />
<br />
The villains plan also makes no sense. They want to more or less genocide quirk users to prevent the apocalypse, even if their bombs basically cause apocalyptic destruction, even if bombs wouldn&#039;t be effective in their goals, bombs are more often than not used for assassinations or intimidation, even if parents that have quirk could give birth to someone without a quirk and vice versa, and so many more issues that would require more spoilers.<br />
<br />
Honestly, with their resources, they could build bunkers to wade out the apocalypse rather than pick a fight that really won&#039;t be as effective as they think. the morons.<br />
<br />
Though I guess the villains are side note, since the film lacks a rising action. It just kinda meanders around until SUDDENLY, we&#039;re in the final act.<br />
<br />
The film doesn&#039;t use it&#039;s time well. At one point there&#039;s a montage of the characters driving across a European country that&#039;s basically Greece. you can walk across most European countries in a day. you&#039;re not going to to be driving across one for a couple days.<br />
<br />
Cut this segment<br />
<br />
Also cut all the cutaways to characters that mean nothing, like the other hero teams, who feel so redundant. cutting to them for a few milliseconds would be fine, but seeing their reactions, making sure they get that lines and have things to do feels like a waste of time.<br />
<br />
The first movie picked a select characters to use, and gave the others frames of time on screen. cameos basically. The second film made use of everyone in team battles, strategy, etc. This film wants to give these characters a purpose, but since they&#039;re off to the side, the time is wasted.<br />
<br />
of course they&#039;d have to have something to do, because the stakes are so high, it decreases the tension even more. it&#039;d help if the characters had some focus that added more impact, but the only character who gets any focus is Rody, the film exclusive character, and even his development feels undercut due to all the wasted time.<br />
<br />
He is a good character, I&#039;d say better than most of the wastes of space Horikoshi writes. He makes decisions based on his character, ones that don&#039;t necessarily seem like the good guy thing(he doesn&#039;t do it that much tho). He&#039;s not just a generic good guy, and he has plenty of time to express his personality. As opposed to a lot of Hero Aca characters whose decisions are all....basically the same with a different skin/design/single personality trait.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, this film was made for profit. I don&#039;t think anyone really cared outside of the animators. The film was marketed as being about Deku, Bakugo, and Todoroki, but realistically, Bakugo and Todoroki are just there for the poster. it&#039;s not like the second film where Bakugo actually felt important, as did his relationship with Deku.<br />
<br />
The film almost has something at one point, a villain who sees quirk as evil, and a hero(Deku), who sees them as something for good. they don&#039;t have a lot of time to develop this conflict, and they ruin it by...implicating Deku as ablest.<br />
<br />
The villain&#039;s quirk has made it difficult for him to interact with other people. He can&#039;t touch them, in short. Then we have Deku, who, while quirkless at one point, could still live a completely normal life. Most people in Hero Aca do that outside of heroes and villains. This isn&#039;t counting the fact that Deku has had everything handed to him by All Might, more or less<br />
<br />
So when Deku tells the villain that he &quot;wasn&#039;t trying hard enough,&quot;. it just comes off as a privileged rich kid telling a guy in a wheel chair the same thing. This wasn&#039;t the intention, I think the writers just weren&#039;t thinking, but it&#039;s a big issue, and makes me hate Deku in a way, even if the real thing I hate is this film.<br />
<br />
This film is awful, it&#039;s boring, it&#039;s stupid, and it&#039;s even good for a few laughs at points(tho not enough to make it so bad it&#039;s good). Save your money, or go to a different one<br />
<br />

Class 1A and 1B are back on a mission world wide to save humanity from those who believed that quirks are doomed. <br />
<br />
The first My Hero movie was bad, and the second was my favorite movie of that year. The movies always feature awesome animation of action scenes. It was a treat to enjoy the character fighting and pulled out incredible moves. The biggest problem with the movies is that they are basically filled with no consequences to the main series. Because of this, the story usually had little significance and not worth investing, except maybe the second movie.<br />
<br />
The third installment was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422848">
        almost no different. The fight animation was still fun, although not as awesome as the second. Shoto, Bakugo, and Deku all had their own scenes where they showed their ultimate moves, and I enjoyed the movie mostly for that. <br />
<br />
However, the story was again not memorable. It moves very quickly without any deep exploration into the villains or why the Humarise organization rose. This time Deku made another companion, who had a pretty lame quirk that wasn’t worth all the wait. The quirk didn’t have as much significance as it was intended to when it was revealed.<br />
<br />
Also, near the end Deku again pulled out a new move, which I had a problem with. It would be spoiler to talk about it, but basically it should have had more consequences. Of course, the movie just didn’t even bother justify it. At least the second movie tried to for Deku’s ridiculous move. <br />
<br />
Overall, it should not be a surprise that the actions were fun, but the movie was still forgettable. 7/10

    Not too many reviews but got to give my opinion.<br />
<br />
Up to date on anime, near up to date on manga. <br />
<br />
So this is a grand scale mission which would fall in mid season 5. on a story where they cooperate to locate and stop a faction of individuals which i find oddly mirrors what is happening in the anime at the time. Nothing too deep or groundbreaking.<br />
<br />
The art especially n the earlier part of the movie was a bit crude and even more cartoonish that usual. mostly for comedic effect but didn&#039;t feel right. however there were a few fast paced chase and combat scenes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422730">
        that were animated, especially saving it for the last assault, where they pulled amazing animation and beautiful art .<br />
<br />
Characters were focusing on the 3 promoted Deku, Bakugo and Todoroki but that was clear, but with plenty of other heroes shown. Introduced a new character that would be with Deku through the movie, which was found to redeem himself throughout. The characters that stood out most to me however were the sub-villains. Very impressive quirks, character design and really boosted the movie in my opinion. <br />
<br />
Overall it felt like a side story but was generally just good. Not amazing, not too exciting or a must-see just a good side story event with good evil organisation enemies.
