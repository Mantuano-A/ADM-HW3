Science is the study of everything around us. From the early stages of our universe, to the ancient civilizations in the past that leads us to our modern and technological society. Then we come to society. What makes a society even? The people. Humanity have transcended and evolved for generations and generations and will continue evolving like an endless cycle of life.<br />
What does a human compose of? Cells, organs, organ system, tissues, atoms, molecules, ions and so on and so forth. This things, particularly the cells, are the ones that keeps on giving

        humanity life as we know it. From RBCs transporting oxygen throughout the body, to the WBCs fighting and defending our body against foreign invaders. Truly, the human body is indeed the best work of art. And then an anime based on this heroic beings finally aired this Summer 2018 as being one of the unique anime this season.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
This anime &quot;Cells At Work.&quot; doesn&#039;t have a chronological order in terms of the plot because, as we know it, the story of it is about the cells of our body. What they do against diseases, injuries and other life-threatening phenomenons that can happen to our body. Each character or cells of the story contributes on every episode because of their functionality. For example, the Blood Circulation episode which is of course mainly for Red Blood Cell, while the Thymocytes episode is about the childhood life of Killer, Regular, and Helper T Cell. We get to know on each episode how artistic, beautiful and smart the author of Cells At Work manga (which the anime based on) in plotting out different things about the cells different capabilities based on their real life counterpart. It is honestly very hard to make a manga or anime out of this characters as cells on our body are really hard to describe on, draw to different anime characters and have traits on them contributing to a anime world full of cells. For example, White Blood Cell (Neutrophil) is killing those bacteria, viruses or any type of foreign invaders with a knife and sprayin them afterwards. That is one of the smart moves I&#039;ve seen that the author applied to be on an anime character because if they base it on the real WBC then it will just look.... weird and hideous as the WBC on our body actually engulfs and then digests the invader with enzymes, powerful enough to kill it (Phagocytosis). Another example of how the anime presented White Blood Cells&#039; migration process to being like them passing through pipes and killing the enemy. Another smart move of the author is the settings and environment of the story. I love how each place whether it is the heart, lungs, or even the stomach have details that we viewers can understand and is accurate to the real life progression of this organs. From the heart being like a temple/shrine depicting how holy or important it is to the normal places where cells are on their apartment buildings, its easy to say the artist of the anime or manga really work so hard on this anime. We also cannot forget how the anime have some comedic elements revolving the adventures of the Red Blood Cell. This element is not that important but if you look at it, it does as it makes the show more entertaining not overall being a show to present only what cells are doing. It also have dramatic elements from the fight scenes and especially the Cancer episode. Who would&#039;ve thought some of us audience gets pity on cancer just because how dramatic the scene was. Another great factor of Cells At Work is that it is an educational anime where everyone can watch it even though you have a failing grade in Biology or you just hate it. It provides small and summarized text about a certain cell, method, disease and pathogens which makes it very informative not only fun to watch. Overall, the story&#039;s accuracy comparing it to the real life cells and systems are just a masterpiece to look at as well as its representation of the cells on their role on any biological terms (or the episodes).<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
In terms of characters, we get to see alot of characters here since this is literally about your body which comprimises of trillions of cells. Its diversity of characters, fitting them all together with no one being as important as any one because of their functions makes the show a worth to watch if you&#039;re interest is Biology. We have the RBC&#039;s who carry oxygen through our body, WBC that defends us from pathogens as well as Macrophages, T-Cells, B-Cell and NK-Cell. (there are alot more so I ain&#039;t going to list those cells). Then the pathogens either a virus, bacteria or even cancer have roles to the story depending on the episode where they shine to be the antagonist threatening our human body. What I like about the characters is that even though they all have different purposes, on some instances everyone needs to be there, working out together to counter either a scrape wound, virus attack or cancer. I can say as well that we humans are the hidden characters as well on the story. Why? Because if you take a look at the episodes of Cells At Work, on some instances, our cells cannot do anything on their own. For example, the heat stroke episode, where every cell in the body are already dying of heat and just praying for the heavens to rain and then suddenly a big tube coming from the heavens showed up to provide a solution to our body (Transfusion). Hence, characters in Cells At Work is literally just your heroic cells but turn into a more artistic view on TV.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Since the producer of this anime is David Production, which is the company that made Jojo&#039;s art phenomenal, I can see some instances that the art is reflected to Jojos&#039;. For example is the faces of the Killer T-Cells and White Blood Cell, especially when Naive T-Cell turned into a bulky man. The visuals of the anime are really well-done and fits its theme. Who knew Platelets can be this cute?.. Aside from it being well-done, the art of the settings like I said earlier are a genius way to represent the human body systems in a manner that everyone can understand. Not like showing some microscopic things that we the audience that are not professionals on the field of Biology cannot understand at all. Its creativity on everything along with the character designs already a worth to watch anime.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
I cannot stress out how much I love the Opening and Ending of this show. The opening is really catchy. Having lyrics about the cells on how they work and work and we see them doing their functions on the opening is a great way to start or introduce the characters. The ending song is probably my most favorite by ClaRiS so far. It is a song where you can sing along (well you can try even if you don&#039;t know japanese) and it makes you feel really joyful. It is also a song to take away your stress. No issues at all on the background music as they all fit the sequence.<br />
<br />
Overall thoughts and Enjoyment:<br />
As a student who loves studying Biology, I totally enjoyed this show. The fact that anime can transcend even into our bloodstream is just amazing when you look at it. I always have the moment of excitement when I watch this because I can relate some of what&#039;s happening because of Biology class. It is very creative, very well-done and a masterpiece. This shows that anime can literally make everything good. Overall, I really really love this show and it is such a fine work of art as well as a masterpiece. I recommend you to watch this if you like a summarize version of what&#039;s happening on our human body everyday.<br />

    Cells At Work is an educational series about how the human body functions on cellular level. Its source material was originally released in the Japanese science magazine called Gross Biological Stuff and Geeky Nerdy Shit Weekly, now made into an anime format to ensure the misinformation of this shonen comedy reaches a wider audience. <br />
<br />
I refuse to use the reddit meme phrase &quot;&quot;as a&quot; biology major&quot; to back up my rhetoric with titles -- moreover, majoring biology requires bit more than reading 3 wikipedia articles about cells -- so instead I will say this series has a pretty interesting take on something that could be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284984">
        called pseudo-science. I am still deeply disappointed that this wasn&#039;t like &#039;Moyashimon&#039; -- the most accurate series about agriculture ever created, or like &#039;Once Upon a Time...Life&#039; -- the French animation franchise produced in the 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s, &quot;Life&quot; being only one of the many parts of it. Instead, we have a comedy series that can be enjoyed the best by completely excluding its settings. However, I like comedy as well... unfortunately, that&#039;s where this show really flops. <br />
<br />
The opening song (lyrics and opening animation) alone are the perfect alarm to everyone who expected this to meet the shonen demographics as this is the most childish shit opening I recall ever seeing. Turns out the series is not much better. <br />
<br />
Our story centers around this female red blood cell who never finds her way to where she is supposed to go because she is dumb, and this white blood cell dude who is always at the right place at the right time like the hero he is. Reddo girl runs from place to another and discovers bacteria and whatever nasty shit, followed by mr. white rekking them like he is Saitama from One Punch Man. That&#039;s pretty much the entirety of the series as it is nothing but below average fighting tournament shonen disrespecting its settings with references that only appear smart to people who aren&#039;t -- and centering around 2 extremely uninteresting characters. None of this would be a problem if the series was clearly aimed for children, but unfortunately all of this is just childish: great many children shows are more mature than this, moreover, children series tend to have charm which this one is missing completely. <br />
<br />
I am personally huge fan of Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure, but after constantly witnessing barely mediocre series from David Production, I am starting to think they will be one franchise miracle and not much more. Cells at Work&#039;s biggest achievement is strengthening this thought. This is the seasonal anime series that I really wanted to like. Unfortunately that has proven to be hard because it sucks. I can recommend seasonal anime watchers to watch the first episode and decide after that if this is worth of it or not, but personally, I say it&#039;s not worth much. <br />

As a nursing student who has had to take microbiology, anatomy, and immunology classes and such I have to say I&#039;m quite surprised as to how accurate and informative this anime is whilst being able to have a laugh at the way they portray formed elements and bacteria as characters and the landscape of the different transportation systems and organs in the body. <br />

This anime is great and I highly recommend it to anyone, especially if you&#039;re looking to learn about cell biology-although I believe it&#039;d

    Hataraku Saibou or Cells at Work has been highly praised despite his lack of story and the lack of characters just because it&#039;s unique and innovative.<br />
If Hataraku Saibou can do something is to show that originality is not a guarantee of a good anime.<br />
The show lacks something that i still cannot precisely explain. After the initial shock you quickly realize that despite its originality this anime is incredibly generic (does that make sense? i dunno but thats how i felt while watching this).<br />
<br />
Story: There is no story, this is kind of a simpsons slice of life where at the end of the day everything is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290413">
        fine and dandy. Episode 12 and 13 were the most entertaining of all of them because the story felt real even if just a little. Sadly i personally felt that the ep 13 was the worst animated of all them so it took a little bit of the magic of the finale to this anime.<br />
<br />
Art: It&#039;s David Production. It&#039;s good.<br />
<br />
Sound: The VA&#039;s were perfect and both the opening and the ending are incredibly catchy.<br />
<br />
Characters: Probably the lowest point of the anime and the most cringy side of the anime fanbase stems from this part. <br />
Aside from probably the MC the rest of the characters hold no value.<br />
Yeah yeah platelet is cute but its a one trick pony that on my opinion exhausts its charm fairly quickly.<br />
White Blood Cell is interesting but we never get to know him at all so he ends up at being plain and it feels like he is just a secondary character that its there. <br />
In the last episode we barely see him a few seconds until the finale.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: If you like gag mangas where nothing really matters then you might enjoy Hataraku Saibou.<br />
<br />
Overall: The show lacks value and intensity.  If i were to be a weeb i still wouldnt like it because there is no waifu material fight me.<br />
 If i were to treat Hataraku Saibou as a normal anime i wouldnt give it more than a 6.

    It’s almost impossible to ignore biology when it comes to the human body. Hataraku Saibou (Cells at Work!) has the confidence to be its own series. It’s like you take the cartoony Osmosis &amp; Jones and turns it into an educational exploration. The human body is complex and that alone really made me wonder how this show could capture its magic.<br />
<br />
I’d say making this show takes a creative mind and the audience should feel connected when watching this anime. Right from the start, the show reveals the human body and what it’s made up of which is essentially red blood cells. It takes place in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290377">
        an anonymous person but one should presume that it’s healthy until it faces conflicts inside. This is where the meat of the show really comes in. The human body is vulnerable and we face consequences every day in our lives.<br />
<br />
But that’s not really the problem, is it? The main course of the anime is composed of human body anatomy. Main characters are composed of Red Blood Cells, in particular one girl voiced by Kana Hanazawa. There’s also a variety of others cells that includes white blood, Killer-T, Macrophage, Memory, and in general, the types that you’d find in any human body. Let’s face it, our human body is made up of trillion of cells. Every cell has its own role whether it’s providing oxygen, getting rid of carbon dioxide, or muscle strengthening. Manga creator Akane Shimizu made this work through innovative thoughts of the actions going on in our bodies.<br />
<br />
With 6+ volumes and counting, the show is only consists of 13 episodes. It became obvious that the story had to limit itself with exploring the full potential of what the human body can do. However, I will say right off the bat that this shouldn’t be something to overlook. Because the more I watched this show, the more I realized how informative it can be. Surprisingly enough, the details of the human body is explored with an accurate representation. There’s information that details with the context of the cells while also examining at the invaders that enters our body. This include germs, virus, and any foreign pathogen that threatens a person. From the first few episodes alone, we realize that our human body is very vulnerable if we don’t take care of it. God gave us our bodies but didn’t make us immortal. Hataraku Saibou definitely shows why.<br />
<br />
Naturally, anyone coming into this show should be wondering how the plot will be structured. While not following a direct linear plot, there’s common recurring themes with pathogens invading the human body. The major selling points of the show is examining how our body works with an innovative way of storytelling. Every action has a consequence and it’s easy to see why. The first few episodes shows this when a group of Pneumococus bacteria attacks a red blood cell before being recused by a white blood cell. The traditional concepts of the show is how characters deal with their problems like the way our human body does. As I mentioned before, our body is very vulnerable and is exposed every day. Even a simple wound opens opportunities for catastrophe if the body isn’t prepared enough. This almost happens in some of the earlier episodes. Other times, the body may not be ready in the first place such as against cases of allergies, heat waves, or food poisoning. When it comes down to it, I think the creator really looked at exploring our bodies’ problems in many ways.<br />
<br />
When the show deploys its character cast well, it’s definitely hard to take eyes off of them. From the variety of cells to the foreign pathogens, there’s colorful cinematography. It would be nice to live in a world where our body is perfect but accidents happen. When they do, your body has to fend them off or there could be disastrous consequences. This is where our cells comes in to take care of the problems and the action in this show wastes no time to showcase that. It’s thrown with an innovative style such as the White Blood Cells brutalizing pathogens or Macrophages showcasing their terrifying skills. Even the cute little platelets in this series has their own duties by reconstructing our body. Many other T-Cells (Helper, Regulatory, Effector) perform their own duties to make sure our body is healthy. I’m not going to lie though, watching this series reminds me to take care good of our own bodies. Realistically, more people die by diseases than any other causes in the world. You can blame that on heart disease, cancer, strokes, infections, etc. The big picture here is that the show also feels very real when we see what our body can do.<br />
<br />
Creative ideas take a creative mind. And I say this with the belief that we definitely needed a talented staff and studio to make this show believable. Thankfully, director Kenichi Suzuki applied his craft that made the show as stylish as it can be. His previous work with Jojo: Stardust Creators and Drifters can occasionally be noticeable with the amount of bizarreness going on. There’s personality injected into the various characters while cinematography is beautifully crafted. There’s also respect to be given to talented voice cast too especially for taking on the roles of these characters. Everyone in the show felt meaningful and there’s not one moment that should be discarded as meaningless. Similarly, the theme songs has a playful energy and atmosphere that never leaves the show.<br />
<br />
I won’t say this anime is easy to watch from first glance. It’s about the human body and in my many years of watching anime, there’s very few that took on this concept. (the closest one that came to mind is Moyashimon) As such, Hataraku Saibou is quite unique with how it manages its ideas, selling its craft, and making it into a reality.

    This series was one of the most unique ones that most have been anticipating since the start of the year, and when it arrived in the lackluster Summer season, aside from the certainty that does not disappoint, it is entertaining to the mildest degree, while having a lot of *pokes* at the function of the most important system: us human beings.<br />
<br />
Now, I don&#039;t care that whether you have studied subjects that are close to this, but I&#039;m fairly certain that no matter our background as people whom have learned about cells in one way or another, Hataraku Saibou, or Cells at Work!, will definitely please

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290387">
        your senses that you are learning about yourself, and the cells that work hard to be able to sustain you in the long run and grow stronger. With that said, everyone, be it otaku or non-otaku, have at least witnessed this anime, and it really broke the conventional walls that this is something that speaks to everyone, as it did magnificently.<br />
<br />
The story is as clear-cut as it gets: Everything that you see within a microscope, are your daily drivers, the cells at work where every funcion is as important as the other. Now, I get it, it&#039;s a series that&#039;s worth the educational take, but thankfully it&#039;s not like a heavy plot pointer of info-dumped force-wrecker, and at least just demonstrates just about right and doesn&#039;t force it on us, which is a good thing. And as usual, the Black Clover aesthetics come back with the usual body-explaining capped-repeat to make sure that you understand what is going with your own body, and then addresses the episodic issue at hand. Honestly though? This is about as entertaining as it gets for anime to get very personal with its viewers, and it succeeds well in that regard.<br />
<br />
The host of characters, oh sorry I mean cells, are the strongest suit of the series. As with portraying the exact minute details of the cells right down to the extreme, I&#039;d say this is a faithful adaptation of the human body. I mean sure, we all know what the Red (Erythrocyte) and White (Neutrophil) blood cells (voiced by the wonderful Kana Hanazawa and Tomoaki Maeno) do and their properties that keep our body safe from harm, but have we ever wondered: &quot;What about the other cells, like the silent killers Macrophage, the disease-preventing killer and helper T cells, the body reconstructing Platelets (ravioli, ravoli, don&#039;t lewd loli platelets!), the weak-willed but strong Eosinophil, to name a few?&quot; The monster designs were weird as hell, especially for the viruses like the mucus-grotesque cedar pollen ones that are easy to kill to the major ones that could cause a disease that could cause serious consequences like heat stroke, hemorrhagic shock and food poisoning. Overall, props to character designer Takahiko Yoshida for his pretty work here.<br />
<br />
David Production, the same studio behind Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure, was a surprise pick for a studio to work on because their work of repertiore really varies from strength to strength, and adding to this, Hataraku Saibou becomes a fan favourite due to their quality of work done here. For example, the &quot;sneeze&quot; segment (that was meant to feel like an explosion) right at Episode 1 was hilarious and insanely funny, and right after that in Episode 2 we&#039;re introduced to the children-like loli platelets (which has become a favourite meme and the pivotal point of the &quot;pressing the loli cheek&quot; smiles), not to mention that to put the icing on the cake, the killer T cells in Episode 3 are the perfect reference to Jojo with the bastardized character figure and the single ponytail hair, that was anything but a fine reference. And in order to make our cells feel like they&#039;re at &quot;real&quot; work, the action scenes around the white blood cells in all types against the numerous viruses with the bloody scenes and over-the-top action. The reason for the drop in score is because some episodes had a minor drop in quality (but not by much), but it is still a visual treat nonetheless. With careful planning and perfect replication, this is a good series to boot its animation quality.<br />
<br />
The music is one where it might get on your nerves, but for what it is, I liked it a hell lot. The OP which is just a collaboration work between the character VAs for Red and White Blood, Killer T and Macrophage really sounded like the mission to keep the human body working, is mundane but the essence is what gives it a home-run strike. There was one episode where the OP was replaced with Killer T and Macrophage VAs, and people are wondering what was that, and that&#039;s just the 2nd cour of the song, which still is good to boot. And oh good god the ED, ClariS nails it once again (as is with every song that they made) with the happy visuals and tones. The background scenes were just as adequate to provide much needed movement for the overall setting, and it&#039;s A-OK!<br />
<br />
If there was that one definite show that will stand the test of time, it will be this one, much lauded for its &quot;breaking the fourth wall&quot; attention that aside from many casual anime watchers, EVEN the workers of true professions (doctors etc.) find that this anime is really a testament to how much knowledge it is given and took all of that into great consideration to keep it as linear as real life as possible. For the Summer 2018 season alone, this one could be many people&#039;s AOTS material and for excellent reasons. if you were skeptical of how the anime medium takes cells into consideration, I highly, HIGHLY plea you to watch this anime, it&#039;s definitely very responsive, reliant and relatable to all of us as imperfect human beings. Now, if you excuse me, I&#039;m gonna take notes and learn as much as I can to regulate my body for the better!<br />
<br />
...Or is it, waiting until the spin-off, Cells at Work! BLACK to be made???

    The Summer season of 2018 seemed to rely heavily on original adaptations when compared to the previous seasons of the same year, especially Spring, when more than half of the top ten most popular anime on this site were sequels. Various well-received returning and continuing anime fought for the position of best show of the cour, all of them with very high ratings; but new releases also held up competently, bringing both classic manga and recent visual and light novels to the screen, along with its fair share of originals. Among the new names of Summer 2018, Hataraku Saibou (Cells at Work!) deservedly warranted much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290326">
        attention, establishing itself as one of the most hyped shows over the course of its successful run. Brought to life by David Production, the show also acted as a testament of the staying power of the relatively new studio as one of the most relevant producers in activity today.<br />
<br />
In a year that kicked off with the lovely Earth-chan springing up everywhere and followed on with other original creations like Tidepod-chan and Explorer-chan, it was guaranteed that the next anime with characters based on inanimate objects would generate a large amount of buzz. And with the premise of showing us a fantastical interpretation of the adventures of the cells in our bodies, Hataraku Saibou drew in countless viewers and absolutely left its mark on the community. As a Pharmacy student, I waited eagerly for this show to start ever since it was announced, and the final result was still way beyond my expectations.<br />
<br />
STORY: 7<br />
Some people describe Hataraku Saibou as an educational anime, a label with which I disagree. Its purpose is pure, unadulterated entertainment, only using scientific concepts as a background, quite like how the Fate franchise handles History in its unique way. Hataraku Saibou avoids simply relying on its gimmick. Its structure is similar to many popular anime, particularly from the shonen genre/demographic, and incorporates exciting action scenes, short but well-crafted character arcs and frenzied twists in the latter parts of each episode. The first episode is a excellent summary of the basic formula and will most certainly captivate everyone who&#039;s open to the experience within its 24 minutes. Personal opinion incoming: anyone who didn&#039;t enjoy the conclusion of that first episode, where after a long chase, a lone germ is contained and put inside a missile named &quot;Sneeze&quot; which is then launched and detonated as cells all around rejoice and salute may be just too cynical to enjoy any work that&#039;s more light-hearted than Berserk.<br />
<br />
Latter episodes up the game by incorporating more intricate concepts that interpolate artistic vision and scientific knowledge, such as Memory Cells being portrayed as conspiracy theorists who warn other cells against an improbable catastrophe - just the way we know how allergy works - taking that chance to present conflicts among the characters. Drugs are represented as robots whose actions expire after a certain time and are seen as a total mystery by the human-styled cells. There are also episodes that provide backstory to some of the main characters and a moving redemption arc for a major villain later on.<br />
<br />
ART: 7<br />
Overall, the art style is nice and the animation is decent, though there is some variation in quality at times. The recycling of sequences and some visible bail-outs in regards to animation were noticeable in the TV broadcast, though DP is already known for its drastic retouches in its blu-ray releases. The overtly detailed and vibrant backgrounds may just be the greatest part of the art direction. Location design gets increasingly captivating with every new episode and we also have a major change in ambience in a final, more serious arc. The visual gags, one of the most universal aspects of Japanese comedy, are also very solid. Fights are extremely over-the-top, with blood flying everywhere and staining the white bodies of the Neutrophils, something which decidedly requires some effort to animate. The carefulness of the work is even surprising, knowing that at that moment, David Production was also busy with the year-long series Captain Tsubasa &#039;18 and the much expected new season of JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 10<br />
Aaaand here we have the strongest suit of Hataraku Saibou. The character design is simply one the best and most charismatically handled in recent memory, with the likeness of the main characters featuring heavily in fanart sites and in social networks. Even without any given names or complex backstories for many of them, we see an incredible, unique method characterization whose charm lies in its simplicity and faithfulness to the original concept - the human body itself. Knowing the biological properties of the cells beforehand, one can already expect some of the characters to have some specific traits, such as the Macrophage being an insanely powerful fighter. The Basophils and T-cells were also other personal favorites of mine. The monster design is spectacularly creative and all of the locations, as I implied before when praising the backgrounds, are evocative and very well-constructed. Trust me, you&#039;ll find yourself eagerly waiting to see how the next group of cells or organs look like.<br />
<br />
And of course, there&#039;s still the moe side of it all. The Platelets, for one, were an instant hit with the anime community and it&#039;s very easy to see why. The show goes all out on wives, too; fan favorites include Macrophage, NK Cell and Eosinophil. Fan theories, like the main character being a defective sickle cell, also run wild, showing the strong engagement that&#039;s already formed between these amazing characters and the fandom.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 7<br />
The soundtrack is fairly competent, with tense tracks playing during the fights and crises faced by the characters, triumphant fanfares at arc conclusions and comfy mood music during the Slice of Life sections. The opening theme is a fun collaboration among the voice actors; the ED is more on the generic side, but that is already decent enough for ClariS. Nevertheless, who steals the scene in the sound department are the CVs themselves, an all-star cast of seiyuu such as Kana Hanazawa, Daisuke Ono, Tomokazu Sugita, and a personal favorite as the narrator: Mamiko Noto. The snippets with them exclaiming the show&#039;s title between breaks will put a smile on your face.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 10<br />
Your mileage may vary on this one. Over the past few years I&#039;ve been studying Histology, Immunology, Hematology and Microbiology, among many other subjects, and all of them converge into the deliciously entertaining mix that is Hataraku Saibou, covering my overlapping interests in both Biology and anime.<br />
Yet, in my opinion, the final result is so ridiculously appealing that being overtly familiar with the subject matter is not a prerequisite to fully enjoy the series. One might even learn a thing or two here, or just sit back and enjoy the ride.<br />
<br />
Hataraku Saibou is definitely worth the try as one of the most relevant anime from its season and hopefully, it will stand the test of time, bringing along the adaptations of the manga&#039;s next chapters and of its spin-offs.

    The first episode and the community hype gives you a lot of hope. But other than the interesting concept (well, it&#039;s not that new, even Osmosis Jones did it), the show is very cliche, has no story (more slice of life), and the characters all basic.<br />
<br />
Before you go on hating this review because this show is your new favourite anime, please give it a minute.<br />
<br />
There have been 5 episodes, and they all have the same storyline. <br />
Something harmful enters the body. <br />
Scares the Red Blood Cell girl.<br />
The White Blood Cell guy comes to save her.<br />
The enemy is stronger than expected (some biological explanation).<br />
Some new cell

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285594">
        or method saves the day (some biological explanation).<br />
<br />
DONE. That&#039;s it. That is the whole show just on repeat. On top of that, we really don&#039;t see any progress in character relationships, the events are predictable (there a scene where a lady cell with a scythe comes to fight zombie like cells, gets surrounded, a T-Cell goes &quot;Ah! Watch out!&quot; and of course, she just swings the scythe to kill them all), and the humour is average (they even missed a chance at the beginning of Epi 5 where they could have made the alert scenes like Evangelion).<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not a bad show, but nothing amazing, nothing that lives up to the community hype. It&#039;s a solid 5/10.

    This is one of the laziest shows I&#039;ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
Lazy characters. The main characters are each one of the cells of your immune system: red blood cell, white blood cell, etc. There is little reason to care about any of them, because they act similarly to their comrades and lack any defining traits that separates them from the trillions of cells like them. And any minuscule defining traits these characters show are being incompetent at their jobs or having backstories that don&#039;t matter in the slightest in regards to their development.<br />
<br />
Lazy setting. Before we stray too far away from the topic of how many cells

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287388">
        there are, this show does an abysmal job at representing how many cells actually exist in this world, and when being a cell of a body entitles you to have a human, sentient form or not. If blood cells can have human forms then why not every other freaking cell that exists in your body? Why can&#039;t parietal cells, ones that secrete stomach juices, be characters, huh? Why can&#039;t Melanocytes make a cameo alongside the loli platelets? Why do nutrients look like human food? This sounds like I&#039;m picking apart something that&#039;s meant to be a quirky world that doesn&#039;t need to make sense, but it just looks and sounds so superficial and stupid. Especially when you consider...<br />
<br />
Lazy story. Generic germs fight, anime explains what these germs do, generic cells fight back, anime explains what cells do. It honestly feels like you&#039;re watching a boring animated biology lecture for your school project. And even if you wanted to learn, it confuses you with these uncreative representations of how things look and work that you&#039;ll end up not learning anything.<br />
<br />
Lazy execution. There are no stakes. Our main character cells don&#039;t die during times they should have. Are you seriously trying to tell me a premature red cell can fare against a big germ in a direct confrontation? Or that a hit from one of the deadliest afflictions of the human body against one white cell doesn&#039;t kill it? NO. And this is a problem because the show themes these events as suspenseful and tense, not to mention it fluctuates between comedy and drama in such a disingenuous way, always making comedic light or emotional moments of events that don&#039;t call for it.<br />
<br />
Lazy comedy and drama. The drama derives of the cells not thinking they&#039;re good enough, then they become good enough, in the same episode. The comedy derives from characters&#039; overreactions, characters which we discussed are boring and generic as they come.<br />
<br />
Just a lazy, lazy show.<br />
<br />
Art is good, stiff at times but still pretty decent. Nothing noteworthy of the soundtrack, OP and ED kinda suck but eh that&#039;s subjective. The design of the white blood cells is honestly great. It&#039;s just that I cannot fathom how it was thematically correct to have white blood cells have such unique designs, and yet have every other cell be a human in a uniform. WHY?!?<br />
<br />
The only reason I stuck around for so long was to see how they tackle the most interesting and deadly disease, you know the one. And it lasts one and a half episodes. No one dies except an unimportant crowd of cells that have the word &quot;Cell&quot; written on their white t-shirts. Lazy.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m so done. I don&#039;t get why people find this show funny, creative or emotionally investing in any regard.

    Hataraku Saibou is an abstract interpretation of how the human body operates as a system, portraying the human body as a society of people (or rather cells) in which all these people have certain tasks to do. This system is constantly under attack, with the main drive of the series being to showcase how this society endures all of the threats placed upon it. There&#039;s not exactly a market for this type of show since biology, an exact science, represented as an abstract concept, by being rebuilt into a system that retains the basic notions within the exat science and changed into something else, is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305708">
        not exactly something that rolls off the tongue, just like this description of the show. <br />
<br />
However, I find that this show can be a good experience for anyone that enjoys observing how systems work, as the show mainly deals with how this society works and how it keeps itself alive as well and the body they are within. Every cell has a role within the body which mostly revolves around it remaining functional. The average episode presents a certain issue that is occurring inside the body and then the cells combat things such as diseases, injuries and even allergies to solve it. Through this episodic process a variety of cell types are presented, as well as how they act within the body and what role they have. The general purpose of each cell is there, as well as that of every ailment, so you can get a general idea of how everything works inside your body if you lacked the knowledge. Observing the imagination behind the parallels between how the human body behaves normally from ailments that we have all suffered and how they are presented on screen can have great entertainment value as well. As long as you do not expect a comprehensive and realistic interpretation of the body, you can find some enjoyment out of observing this system at work.<br />
<br />
The series itself is simple and it has an outlandish idea, which can bring a lot of appeal to itself. But I can foresee it being a negative experience if you seek meaning out of the system it presents. You see I consider that in world building whenever you create a setup, two rules often determine its quality. The first rule, is that you can easily change the setup of the world and the story would continue making sense. The second rule is that while the setup the series has is not mandatory to its success, the fact that it was setup that way enhances the experience in a way changing it would not. In the case of this show, changing the setup would cause the series to lose both appeal, and stop functioning properly. What it presents only functions in its own box. There&#039;s not a lot to analyze the series on, and all you an take in is how the author reimagined the body working as. As a result the world is flawed and this very thing can cause problems, which it indeed does.<br />
<br />
For instance, while the system created within the story and how the body breaks down whenever it suffers of a certain problem can be interesting, the characters couldn&#039;t be any further from being interesting. You see, the cause of this is essentially due to the show doing a great job at showing what every cell is capable of and their duty. The setup they are part of forced them to act in only an one note way because that&#039;s the only way they will make sense in it. Because of this, every character is entirely predictable and there is little to no variation in how these characters act. So whenever the series either tries to do that dumb japanese character driven style of humor, you can predict every joke to come and find it unfunny as a result. Not to mention that because all characters retain the same behavior consistently and a lot of them are copy pastes of each other, not only are the jokes predictable from the very start, but they also get repeated. A lot. So it is hard to even consider this show a comedy. The second issue characters have is that, since you know the exact behavior they will have or are supposed to have, you know exactly what character arc they will have. This is a critical issue when presenting backstory episodes, which are inconsequential and meaningless since you can end up having to sit through 20 minutes of something you could determine on your very own in 30 seconds about the characters. Since the characters are only interesting when related to the system and how they combat an internal problem, focusing on them individually is gonna hurt the watching experience.<br />
<br />
I also have to warn you, that because the series has an episodic format, if the basic essence of what the series does is not going to grip you from the very beginning, things won&#039;t change whatsoever later down in the series. Characters don&#039;t have any motivations and it&#039;s not like the body evolves or has any plotlines happening inside of itself, as the goal of this series is not to tell a story, but present the author&#039;s way of envisioning how the body works. There&#039;s no story for you to consume, and as a result there&#039;s nothing you can want or expect out of this series. What you see is what you get and the decision can be comfortably made by your level of interest in biology and how well battle shounen tropes resonate with you, as the series does treat itself as such during action moments. Which the series contains plenty of. Your first experience with the series can easily be used as your point of reference in regards to continuing to watch this series or not as it constantly delivers the same experience over and over, except for the times it attempts to be character driven.<br />
<br />
Hataraku Saibou is a pretty simple experience despite its original idea. It suffers of a great deal of flaws but it is fairly easy to decide whether or not to watch it. If you enjoy the idea behind the basic premise of the show, I am sure that at the very least the show can be interesting. As long as you do not expect anything complex and just watch for entertainment value, it shouldn&#039;t have much difficulty to get you there. It&#039;s also a very low risk series to try out since, by the time your first experience with the show is done, you know exactly how every future episode will be structured and can form healthy expectations. As long as the backstory won&#039;t harm you, you should be good if you determine this is something you can enjoy. However, all this series presents you is an idea and a system. It presents you with no story, no noteworthy characters and a world that you know exactly how will behave. It has the static feeling of a slice of life but also contains battle shounen elements, which is an odd combination that I can see failing for a lot of people. But at the same time I can just as easily picture people being charmed by it due to what it presents being one of a kind and something closely related to everyone.

    I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen a more average anime than Cells at Work. The art is average, the sound is average, the writing is average (from a literary perspective), the characters are average, the themes are average, just everything. <br />
<br />
Obviously, I wasn&#039;t expecting Legend of the Galactic Heroes when I started watching Cells at Work though, so I can&#039;t complain about its average-ness. I didn&#039;t watch it for the plot. The highlight of Cells at Work is its educational content. Cells at work entertainingly teaches you microbiology. It should win a Nobel Prize for doing that. <br />
<br />
Cells at work teaches the viewer the essential

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333996">
        functions of the body and the immune system. I don&#039;t think I can say this about another anime, but if everyone in the world watched Cells at Work, the world would be a better, safer, and more educated place. And I&#039;m not just saying that because the world is dying from the coronavirus right now (way to date my own review lol), I mean it.

    Disappointing. I was surprised by how educational this show was (not in a bad way), but I was also suprised by how generic many of its plotlines were. For a concept with as much potential as personifying the aspects of the human body, they took the route of presenting it in recognizable anime tropes. This was clearly done to better educate its audience on the functions of the human body (made evident by how it feels targeted to a younger demographic). However, this made it feel like a lesson instead of entertainment and I don’t think I learned that much from it in that regard.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341669">
        The animation looked good in static key frames, but also looked cheap during the fight scenes. I didn’t feel much for the characters, but they at least gave a little development to some characters. The music was whatever, don’t really remember it. Unless the sequel is more acclaimed, I probably won’t watch it. It is closer to a 5 than a 7.

    This is my first review so it&#039;s probably not going to be that good, but I&#039;ll try.<br />
<br />
First off I&#039;d like to say that I&#039;ve always had a love for media that takes a concept and personifies it, and I also have a fascination for biology, so this anime was already perfect for me. The comedy is hilarious and I found myself laughing a lot of times, which I don&#039;t tend to do with most comedies.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
There isn&#039;t much of a standard story, of course, the basic is that we follow the cells in our body, working in their special fields, in a city-like setting.<br />
But the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285144">
        series is episodic, where we get to learn more about a different cell each episode. We even get to learn about the viruses and bacterias! I like that a lot, it&#039;s very enjoyable and educational! But with each episode having different focus points and plot, there will probably be episodes I love and some I didn&#039;t enjoy as much, so far I like them all tho!<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The art isn&#039;t outstanding, but I do find that the design of the characters and the setting in which they live is very creative and nice! I like that the organs and functions of the body is represented as little people or as buildings and structures! And the animation is perfectly fine too! As an animator myself I could not do any better lol!<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
Got to be honest, I&#039;m not good with reviewing sound at all, but for me, it was quite nice to listen to! I found the soundeffects to be appropriate and the voice actors are awesome! Also, the theme song is catchy and cute.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
This is the best part of the series, the main cast is lovable, and they are simplistic, they have one purpose and they stick to that purpose, none of them really have any sad, depressing backstory or anything, they are straight to the point, lovable and funny! I love them all, especially best girl Macrophage.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
I enjoyed this anime so much! It had me laughing so many times, I would rewind scenes that would make me laugh the hardest, and learning about all the cells and viruses in the middle of the plot was lovely, and I love the narrators voice very much!<br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
So far this is the best anime I&#039;ve watched in 2018, but I don&#039;t watch everything seasonal so I can&#039;t say if there&#039;s anything that&#039;s possibly better than this, but from everything I&#039;ve seen, this is my favorite, and I am excited to watch more episodes.<br />
<br />
We are Cells at Work!

    Starting the first episode; I really thought i was gonna be bored out of my mind and get my brain over-heated from knowledge. I wasn&#039;t completely off with the second part there... hehe...<br />
<br />
Yes it is kinda hard to REMEMBER the names of most characters exept the Red and White blood cells. BUT if you give all of them a nickname it&#039;s just twice the fun! The characters are loveable and now and then give you moments squeeling; &quot;Gahhhh I LOVE HER/HIM SO MUCHHH!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
The voice acting was pretty damn great and the cast was generally well known and all are really talented! I&#039;m pretty sure

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336246">
        the seiyuus sing the op and well. IT&#039;S REALLY FRIGGEN FUN!!! I generally pass the OP songs (sorry if that offends some of y&#039;all) but with this show i did NOT skip at least 10/14 of the time. The ending was also Beautiful but didn&#039;t have the patience too listen to that all the time too lol (Sorry &gt;~&lt;) The OP&#039;s visuals were also great!<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t remember the last time i was so exited and happy about a show. I have a whole nother level of appreciation for my body and how it works now. Although i have many many unanswered questions about the Body that the story was set in in the show; I still found myself repeating while watching. &quot;Damn I love ths show...&quot;<br />
I simply do not understand why some people didn&#039;t enjoy it. It&#039;s a solid high 9/10 for me and i almost gave it a full score. They had a unique idea for a show and i don&#039;t think anybody could make a storyline better around this subject and characters. Exited for season 2.<br />
<br />
ps. Hearing Joutaro&#039;s Seiyuu sing and voice act in this show was perfecto.<br />
pps. the main White Blood Cell&#039;s eyes look like Excalibur&#039;s eyes from Soul Eater and nobody can change my mind.

    Cells at Work is a mediocre/slightly above-average show that gets by solely on it&#039;s gimmick, that gimmick being that it takes place in the body and follows the various biological functions, but with personified cells. <br />
<br />
When you first go through the show you might find that it&#039;s plenty of fun. The mere gimmick itself got me to episode 4, but the show&#039;s writing wouldn&#039;t find itself out of place in a stereotypical 5/10 shounen show. It becomes so cliche at point that I found myself cringing a bit, especially in this fourth episode. The show does a lot of fun things with it&#039;s setting but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285117">
        it never uses it for interesting story telling. The characters are a bit flat and 2dimensional (ha ha) and are about as developed as a loaf of bread.<br />
<br />
The animation is alright, it wouldn&#039;t find itself out of place among the ranks the average seasonal anime show, but nothing more than that. There was even an example of a clip of animation being used four times in the fourth episode, which just seems incredibly cheap to me. The shots are never impressive and the scenes are never noteworthy. It just seems like a the camera was plopped onto the scene, but never in any interesting ways, which isn&#039;t atypical to your standard anime but is definitely a point against it. <br />
<br />
If you think that this gimmick alone is enough to stomach mediocre writing, okay to bad animation, decent sound, and flat characters then you should give it a watch. It&#039;s still enjoyable regardless and if you think you&#039;ll like it based on the concept you will probably like it.

    Frankly, i randomly found this while looking for a scientific anime. To be honest, I didn&#039;t expect anything before I started, but as you watch it, you can understand that it is very entertaining and interesting. If I were a biology teacher, I would definitely make my students watch it. Don&#039;t expect too much in terms of action and coolness. However, if you are looking for funny and comfort anime, this will do the job. I really liked the events mentioned (I mean the events in the body) and the reactions of the characters. It has become one of my favorite short anime.

    While there is no denying that Hataraku Saibou is unique and innovative, people seem to believe this, by itself, makes it a great anime. It does not.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, I enjoyed this anime, and thought it would be a great idea to teach kids about biology, but the anime itself is lackluster.<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
A slice of life anime that follows the daily activities of a red and white blood cell. We get to see in detail how the body reacts to different problems and learn more about how the body works. HS gets points for accurate biology and for a novel idea, but unlike your

          <span style="display: none;" id="review291022">
        typical SOL anime, It&#039;s impossible to relate to the characters, because A) They&#039;re blood cells. And B) They&#039;re tropes, exaggerated with the intent to amuse kids. Also, since episodes are designed to be stand alone, it defeats the purpose of a SOL anime.<br />
<br />
In addition to this, because the story is sub-par and to make sure they appeal to kids, they also made it a shounen battle anime. Where nobody important ever dies, the good guys always win, and it&#039;s the weak character we were just introduced to who doubts themselves only to be the hero and defeat the bad guy at the end. But it&#039;s also a Shounen battle anime, where we don&#039;t really care about any of the characters, and villains are introduced and defeated in single episodes which is very tedious.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
Nothing mind blowing or innovative, but it&#039;s still good quality, and pleasing to look at. Excpet the fight scenes. Boy are they lacking in excitement.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
Meh. Nothing bad. Just nothing memorable, or catchy.<br />
<br />
Characters: 4/10<br />
Oh boy. I mean, I know they&#039;re cells. One of trillions of virtually identical cells, but that&#039;s still not a good reason to make them all the same. You could literally swap out the main characters in HS, for another of the same cell, and the series would be exactly the same. All characters are tropes, and no attempt is made at development, aside from hints at some kind of attraction between Red and White.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
I really enjoyed the first 2-3 episodes. It was very educational, and biologically correct, which I really enjoyed, but then I realized that a novel idea and biological accuracy were the only things this show had going for it. I think the entire anime maybe got a handful of chuckles out of me, which as a gag anime, is quite pathetic. It became a chore to watch the following episodes, hoping against hope that maybe the show might develop into something good. (It doesn&#039;t). <br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10<br />
<br />
The gimmick of following the Cells in your body is interesting, but not enough to put up with such a boring story, bad writing, and 2D generic trope characters who you don&#039;t care about. If anyone remembers the show Ozzy and Drix, it was a similar idea, but one much better executed (albeit with worse art).<br />
<br />
If I ever have kids, I might watch it again for educational reasons, but aside from that, I never want to see this show again.<br />

    Nearly ignorant of biology,I’m much obliged to はたらく細胞 for imparting me those biological knowledge about our body ,cells and innards,etc in such a colourful ,informative and appealing way.As for me,I don’t agree this anime should be categorized into pseudo-science.Because there is no convincing evidence showing its presentation of biological education is erroneous as yet.Abd we are still not too retarded to be devoid of the faculty for identifying the practice of anthropomorphism,that is to say,we certainly know the silhouette of cells are not human-like,and bacteria are not actually into the way like the intellectual aliens.If an anime bound up with science education could manage to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review286862">
        tantalize my appetite to delve into the sphere around which the one centers,I think it is a success despite its so-called“superficiality”. <br />
In addition，the shaping of the characters is so excellent ! Indeed,the two main characters ,red/white blood cell,impressed you a lot,but the supporting characters are also memorable .I have a hunch that I would hardly forget the adorable platelets,the serene but also aggressive maids macrophages,the eerie ninja basophil ,the virile and muscular T-cells ,the miserable and doomed cancer cells,and so on.Each of them is so individual and subtly created in reference with their practical functions in real life.To be frank,David Production ,as well as the writer Shimizu has the techniques in making you infatuated with the characters created and immersive in that fantastic world setting.<br />
However,it is a bit ironic that your cells are living in such a society，which you might call Utopia or authentic Communism without exploitation and sordid currency circulation system（well，regardless of the fact that they don’t have an option to select their occupations ）,whereas you are being compelled to struggle hard ,work like a dog,and watch Hataraku Saibou at the same time as eating instant noodle to appease your hunger. From this perspective,we might find more resonances from the manga Hataraku Saibou Black rather than this TV series(lol).<br />
Nevertheless,don’t be crestfallen by comparison,see,they are always bouncy rather than being jaded,protecting you and fighting for you relentlessly without a pause.Consequently，shall we give them some positive responses ? :）<br />
In a word,I hope you enjoy the show !
