    First review (7/25/16). This movie is great and just miraculously outstanding. Eichiro Oda never fails to deliver beauty in art to his audience. The music is fantastic thanks to the music staff that put their soul into the making . The colors are just so sharp,crispy and delicious. The story is fantastic as always expected from the most popular mangaka of all time. 4 Dimensional Experience is legitimately the best experience. Watching this movie on the day of its release was like a dream come true. I am a pirate but these are better pirates if you get what I mean.<br />

Luffy (Gear 4)<br />

    Story<br />
<br />
Our beloved straw hats are going to the biggest casino in the world to have some fun and of course they will meet the owner himself!<br />
<br />
Location<br />
<br />
The Casino is the biggest ship I’ve ever seen in the series and I couldn’t believe it was moved by 2 gigantic turtles! “There is gold, gold, everywhere” I mean the whole casino is filled with golden buildings, statues, restaurants, hotels and even golden amusement parks!<br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
The animation is by far the best performance I’ve seen in a OP Movie! I was really happy to see some darker colors in the movie because the casino is filled with thousands of golden

          <span style="display: none;" id="review225137">
        stuff. So I saw yellow and golden colors the whole time. They have done everything right at this point!<br />
<br />
Sound <br />
<br />
The sound was incredible! Background music, conversations and fights. Everything was sounding like I wore high end headphones the whole time!<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
There are so many apperances from older arcs and of course I will not tell you who I mean! I loved the costumes because our beloved crew got some noble outfits!<br />
<br />
Audience<br />
<br />
I heard so many laughs during the movie because there are so many funny moments while the straw hats are enjoying the time in the casino!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed One Piece: Gold, because I love to see how the straw hats enjoy their time like a family! The best part are the final fights and they are all insane!<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
Watch this movie! You’ll see a lot of old characters from the past and a lot of funny moments with luffy and the rest of the crew.

    One Piece Film: Gold is the third modern One Piece movie and the second post timeskip. At this point the formula for a One Piece movie has been set in stone, and it is most efficient to evaluate the film based on how it meets expectations.<br />
<br />
From an aesthetic perspective the movie is basically flawless. The animation is gorgeous, the character designs are on point, and every costume change the case goes through is exciting and memorable. The film-exclusive character is far more memorable than most of her predecessors as she is an old girlfri- I mean accomplice of Nami&#039;s from her cat burglar days, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review372366">
        their dynamic is simple but effective. Getting the One Piece cast to do a heist film is inherently interesting given how batshit insane the characters are, and the genre-standard twists are handled well. There is a particular sub-twist that makes perfect sense in universe that was both inspired and hilarious.<br />
<br />
The movie isn&#039;t flawless character wise. Like most OP movies the characterization is slightly off. Nami, despite having ample screen time, never comments on the fact that the kids enslaved by the casino are basically in the same situation she was in for a decade. Luffy seems unusually apathetic when a crewmate is placed in danger in the first act. Nothing is egregious, but it is enough to take notice. As for most modern OP films some characters are included for no reason other than to have them in marketing material. Still have no idea what Sabo and Lucci were doing. The gambler character introduced serves no particular purpose and just drags down the movie in the middle.<br />
<br />
The main villain is compelling ideologically, but never gets quite enough attention to make sense. His devil fruit is busted to the point it is completely unbelievable, and the main confrontation between him and Luffy suffers as a result. Cool idea, but not enough spice to make him memorable.<br />
<br />
Its a good One Piece experience, but outside the outfits and nice cuts of animation provides nothing to remember it by.<br />
<br />
Score: Strong 6 to a Light 7

    I am a big fan of One Piece, have always been and as a fan this movie is a must watch, not because it is canon but because it might be one of the best One Piece movies.<br />
<br />
In fact, i think it is the second best One Piece movie right after Strong World. I am not a japanese speaker but i had the luck to be able to watch it in the theaters in japan right after it came out. It was a highly entertaining movie, and just about as good as a non canon movie can be.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think this is a movie exceptionally

          <span style="display: none;" id="review225909">
        good for someone who doesn&#039;t know the main story already, but i went to see it with people that are not into the One piece universe and they liked it very much too.<br />
<br />
What might be considered the worst part of the movie are the villains, Tesoro is fine as a main villain but his &quot;crew&quot; was really lackluster unfortunately. Due to the high number of the main cast (straw hats) it was impossible to give every one of them a super important role. The ones who where lacking in this movie where brook and chopper mostly.<br />
<br />
This movie focuses mostly on Nami, Luffy and Franky which was a very good surprise. I also loved one of the characters from Tesoro&#039;s crew, Carina was the highlight of the movie for me.<br />
<br />
This movie had a fair share of entertaining plot twists and also a very good setting.<br />
<br />
Finally Toei gave One Piece the animation quality it deserves with some beautiful fights throughout the entire movie. The sound for me in the cinema was too loud, which was a detriment to the show especially during the start of the movie and at the end, with explosions that where both capable of destroying ships as much as they where able to destroy my ears capability of hearing.<br />
<br />
Overall a must watch for One Piece fans, it was such a joy to watch, especially with the huge amount of references to the main series. If you are not a One piece fan i also recommend this movie because it is very entertaining even though you might feel a bit lost with the terminology like Haki, Devil fruits, Awakening.<br />
<br />
My Overall score for this movie is a 7, this does not mean that it was a bad movie by any means, in fact this means its a highly recommendable movie. As i said previously if you are a fan of the series you are gonna absolutely LOVE this movie.<br />
<br />
Absolutely worth the 15$ i had to pay for my ticket to the cinema.

    This is far better than most of the movies I have recently seen.<br />
Trust me, I know what I&#039;m saying. Even though I pay most of the attention to the story and music, all the elements of the story contributed to extremely outstanding time I had watching this movie. <br />
Because Film Gold is everything that a good Vegas - style movie should have - a thrill, respectful villain, and this outstanding music that deepens the entire experience.<br />
<br />
And Film Gold is packed with goodies since the very beginning, when the Strawhats arrive at Gran Tesoro. The giant show, incredible battle sequences (oh yes! Gold has the best

          <span style="display: none;" id="review225718">
        fight scenes EVER!), the design of the golden city, giant race, the long - gone characters that we all craved to see on the screen since they were announced to appear... <br />
<br />
In fact, the only thing I didn&#039;t like that much were the voices of Carina and Baccarat. They didn&#039;t match the characters at all, especially Baccarat, who spoke in a very flegmatic, annoying way. I also hoped that Carina would sing something, since she was supposed to be Gran Tesoro&#039;s singing queen. Gild Tesoro&#039;s inspirational and moving flashbacks also were given too little time, which I guess would be welcomed with open arms by the most of the audience.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, One Piece: Film GOLD is a masterpiece and a crown jewel of entire OP franchise. If you want to see it, definitely do it in the cinema! It&#039;s one of those outstanding movies that should be viewed only there... You won&#039;t regret.

Art was to be expected of a high movie budget toei onepiece film, and the sound was passable aswell. It was jazzy and bombastic fitting for the casino setting.<br />
Overall-<br />
only gets up to a 2 because of one man of principal. Sgt Straight. The only reason i stuck with this movie to the bitter end. As a Fellow man of principal I cannot recommend this movie to anybody that enjoys quality anime. RIP.<br />
&quot;Turns are disgusting, just like the plot twists in this movie.&quot;-Sgt Straight

    Watching One Piece Film Gold was a very passive experience. It wasn’t amazing, but it wasn’t bad. Nothing stood out, and nothing really annoyed me; the characters were fine, the villains weak, and overall it did feel separated from the general narrative. It was a nice change in the pace of One Piece movies, with a couple of predictable twists. While I wouldn’t call it a cash grab, it was pretty close, as it, for the most part, was very uninspired. <br />
<br />
The movie’s plot was what you would expect from a movie, a plot that “does the job,” and that’s it. Sailing on the ocean,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review374778">
        the Straw Hats come across a floating ship (I’d think) larger than Thriller Bark, the theme of this ship gambling. With thousands of Casino’s, betting places, and gambling halls, it is said to be the largest gambling place globally, where many earn their fortunes for life there. Nami, of course, encourages them to go, and they enter the literal city of gold. Greeted by a shower of gold, they excitedly enter the city. They play around, winning some games, and losing others, but after being cheated out of over 500 million Beli, Zoro is taken captive, with the only way of freeing him to win and pay within 24 hours. This leads to a heist, in which the Straw Hats team up with an unlikely friend to steal from the grand vault that contains 20% of the world’s currency to free Zoro. <br />
<br />
Now, as a setting, the island is a little weird. Most of One Piece is in a less technologically advanced era than us, their snails being the most advanced thing (aside from Vegapunks creations) we have seen. However, the city oozes with casinos that have elevators, slot machines, and more gold than seems possible. It may seem cool in a worldbuilding perspective that it implies that other ships like thriller bark act as entire islands, but ultimately it depends on how it is pulled off. While Thriller bark somehow fits, Film Gold just doesn’t. It feels just like an island that the Straw Hats went, unconnected to the One-Piece world, rather than another small piece in the world of One Piece. While Casino’s might exist in the One Piece world, it didn’t seem to fit. That being said, there were plenty of other things that worked amazingly and were nice throwbacks. We see our favorite character, Cipher Pol agent. Spandam collects the heavenly tribute from the island that allows it to act as part of the world government, a small piece of the previously mentioned information. We see things such as the world nobles, all the different transponder snails, and wacky fruit powers that have nothing todo with strength, each small pieces that add up. While they aren’t the show’s focus, it’s these weird and little things that still populate the world from setting to setting, letting us know it is One Piece and the settings we love. While there were no outstanding or crazy worldbuilding displays, it was still there in small, enjoyable bits that you might find independently. <br />
<br />
Despite the first two paragraphs, the concept of the movie was unique. It didn’t go for the typical, save people from oppression, or help the weak, or even the personal connection that most movies do. It set up a friendly and familiar place that seemed cool but then was flipped on their heads, and they specifically could not use their powers, forcing them to use their brains rather than their raw strength. It forces the characters to use their powers in more unconventional ways. Rather than just busting right through, the movie takes advantage of its average budget for more of a cool and calculated movie. There were small hints like most movies and buildup for the final battle trying to build themes of oppression. And while the buildup was in generic ways that have been seen many times, it still managed to work and deliver the theme even if it was a generic one.<br />
<br />
While It wasn’t amazing or kept me interested the whole time, it was interesting enough to warrant a watch, the ending, and the new character Carina, small things that helped the movie feel bittersweet, despite being mediocre. The character Carina helped the movie connect to the One Piece world and change up the dynamic a bit. Watching only the Straw Hats Converse is always fun, and you still want more, each pure interaction gold. However, no matter how good the movie’s writers are, it doesn’t always capture the charm. It just leads to conversations we have heard a lot in the 1000chapter story, but adding a personal connection always makes it change up to seem more interesting. Carina seems to be one of Nami’s friends back in the time when she was stealing and looting pirates for Arlong, reminding us of her past, as well as making it feel more real. It sets up an enjoyable dynamic, as they were both temporarily allied thieves, meaning that they could backstab anyone at any given time, making them cautious but also really close, a bond that we rarely see. They tease and play around but can switch to serious at the flip of a coin. While she isn’t a fantastic character, she is always interesting and gives the movie that extra spice it needed. <br />
<br />
The Straw Hats were fine in the movie, their interactions fun but not as fun as the main story. They each get small moments to shine, focused more on their powers and abilities than personalities (aside from Nami)but still had their personalities intact. They seem to be at the development between Dressrosa, and Zou, allowing for some power-ups and collecting all the characters in one voyage. The villains were also nicely handled, as they weren’t just generic villains, but smart ones that weren’t evil for the sake ofbeing evil. Their actions made sense, and each was quite decent. The first villain was a masochistic armament Haki user, who was the size of Ivankov. The second villain was a wielder of Raki Raki no mi, and who had an elegant personality. The third villain was a vampirish guy who had the nuki nuki no mi and just gave off a creepy vibe. While they weren’t fantastic characters by themselves, they were devout followers of Guild Tesoro, who had a compelling enough ideology that made them become followers who seemed both reasonable and loyal. Guild Tesoro had a backstory that served the purpose of making you understand his actions while not justifying them. It made an irredeemable villain that you could understand but never stand by, one we don’t see very often anymore. Combined with expert use of his devil fruit, cunning schemes, and being strong as well as smart, he made for quite a good antagonist for the movie. They needed the money and respected money, and the Straw Hats are bad people in the world government’s eyes. If there were one thing that I would complain about, however, it would be the fact that he became a giant monster at the end, like almost every other One Piece movie antagonist, but aside from that, he did well in his movie. <br />
<br />
The art and animation were adequately done, allowing for some small and interesting fights. While they weren’t like the regular movie Sakuya, it still did the job of giving some interesting combinations. The One-Piece characters all looked like One Piece characters, and the animation was nice and good. The sound design, for the most part, was forgettable but didn’t hinder the movies watching experience. It did all it needed to do and enhanced certain scenes it needed to.<br />
<br />
Throughout the movie, I never thought, “This is Amazing.” After watching the slightly disappointing Film Z, it definitely was a step up and interesting but never came close to blowing me away. On a 100 point scale, I would rate it as a 6.94, but not a 7 as it just didn’t land right. Again, the setting, story, villains, and plot were fine and fun, but not something to brag or tick off a list, just something that ticked over. I do suggest you watch it if you have time on your hands, as it is quite decent. I might be underrating is as I was disappointed slightly, and it could very well be a solid 7. But at the end of the day, more One Piece is always good. <br />

    People have written so many good reviews for this film..how it even scored 8 in myanimelist is surprising for me -_-<br />
<br />
Movie is extremely boring to be honest. Characters are not even properly utilized. In short, characters dont do anything. Rather than seeing Nami x Carina backstory , it would have been better to show us Tesoro&#039;s story which seemed more interesting...Story is well...there is no story. They should stop wasting money like this. <br />
<br />
Sound and Art are very good. <br />
<br />
I didnt enjoy the movie at all as far as enjoyment is concerned, the proof of it was that i was skipping scenes which i usually

    The amount of advertising and hype leading up to this film rivals that of Strong World. Since Oda gave his stamp of approval (as well as being the executive producer) the fans had high expectations for Film: Gold. <br />
<br />
The Straw Hat pirates visit a large ship / city on the ocean known as Gran Tesoro but things take a turn when one of the members of the crew is captured and set to be executed. <br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
The story, while interesting, felt like it was lacking at times. Certain parts felt rather rushed while others seemed as if they were dragging on. The first 30 minutes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226442">
        or so were probably my least favourite of the movie. The scenery of Gran Tesoro is beautiful but the number of times the camera pans around buildings and streets starts to feel like an extended 3D tour of the city rather than relate to the plot. <br />
Starting about 30 minutes in is when the story actually takes off and for the most part it&#039;s well written. If you know One Piece, you know what to expect. The plot doesn&#039;t deviate from the standard One Piece storytelling or take any major risks. I see this as both a plus and a minus. It&#039;s /good/ that the writers of the movie didn&#039;t try anything new or crazy that might conflict with the overall story and characters of One Piece, but the /bad/ is that the film is very predictable because it follows an extremely familiar story structure. <br />
<br />
There were also a few times that things felt out of place. For example, about an hour into the movie there is a sequence when the Straw Hats are breaking up into teams (as they often do) and the whole thing felt like a video game cut scene. While it was artsy and cool to look at, the whole thing was a bit random to me. <br />
Speaking of breaking into teams; one of the best highlights of this movie for me was Luffy and Franky teaming up. Off the top of my head I can&#039;t recall that happening recently, but it worked really well for the film. Had a few good laughs in the scenes with the two of them. <br />
<br />
Truly the last half of this film is what brought this movie from &#039;ok&#039; to &#039;good&#039; in my honest opinion. I personally didn&#039;t much care for the first few parts with seemingly random car chases and gambling, but once Luffy and the Straw Hats face off Tesoro the first time is when things start to get interesting, and then later when splitting into teams is when everything gets exciting. <br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
As it is with most One Piece movies, especially in recent years, the art is spectacular. Lots of effort put into the visuals, the sets, and even the clothes... the Straw Hats make at least 3 major wardrobe changes in this film!<br />
The animation is much smoother and more detailed than what we see in the anime, and during the fight sequences is when the animation really shines. For example, we haven&#039;t seen Gear Fourth used in a film with a high budget up until this point, and (though it was short lived) it looked great. <br />
<br />
Like I mentioned before, the scenes at the start with them going through the city and all the pan shots felt weird, but that&#039;s really the only downside to the art that I could see. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
The voice acting was just as good as I wanted it to be; there was heart and effort in their deliveries and I couldn&#039;t have asked for more. What should be talked about as well as the voice acting is the soundtrack.<br />
The music in this was phenomenal! One of the best soundtracks I&#039;ve heard in a One Piece film. A few of the songs in particular stood out to me, some of the darker scenes were made all the more chilling with the music that accompanied it. <br />
<br />
Same goes for the more exciting or high energy scenes, the upbeat music was very well timed with the comedy. I would watch this film again just for the sake of this soundtrack. <br />
<br />
Character: 7 <br />
Our main cast is all present for this movie. Currently in the manga / anime the Straw Hats have split up and it&#039;s been a long while since they were all together. So it was refreshing to see everyone. <br />
Not every character gets a shining moment though. Some of the Straw Hats just stood there for the majority of the film. Even characters like Sanji only got a few good kicks in for his final fight and that might be disappointing to many fans. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll avoid spoilers, however as a side note, there are characters who I wish had gotten more screen time and I also wish some of the new characters that were introduced had more time to be developed as well. Since it is a movie it&#039;s limited in what it can deliver because of time, but I think they could have afforded to give these new characters a few extra minutes. <br />
<br />
Tesoro was a great villain with an intriguing past. I wasn&#039;t expecting to learn much about his history but we do get a crash course on his childhood / young adult life and the story did well to make him more than a one-dimensional villain. Perhaps not to the point that you sympathize with him much since there were few redeeming qualities about him, but it is nice when the writers put effort into making a character more than just a raging psychopath with no motivation. I wish we could have seen more of his history, but either way I was satisfied with what I received. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
There were several laugh-out-loud funny moments in this film. While not all around comedy gold, there were a few distinct parts where I just folded laughing. <br />
<br />
As previously mentioned, the art is great and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing how nicely the fights were animated. If anything, the fights in the movie alone are worth the price of admission. There was enough action and adventure throughout the run-time and I walked out feeling satisfied. <br />
<br />
When comparing it to other One Piece films, I&#039;d say I enjoyed it more than Film Z, but overall I&#039;d say it is not as entertaining as Strong World. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
If you like One Piece, go see this. If you don&#039;t like One Piece, I doubt this will be the movie to change your mind. It still has all the typical and at times “cliche” One Piece moments, and follows the same structure we&#039;ve seen with many villains and storylines in the original series, but even so it&#039;s a fun ride. <br />
<br />
While this is not the best One Piece film in my opinion, it still ranks high on the list and is certainly worth watching.<br />

    They are doing great every One Piece Movie.<br />
<br />
The movie starts with Straw Hats are going to the biggest casino in the world and they meet the owner of the Casino. Then movie is starting.<br />
<br />
The animation is good as always. I really happy to see some dark costumes because they look really, really good on our crew.<br />
<br />
Like Stampede Movie wee saw a lot of characters from older arc. I really like that they show different and old characters in almost every movie.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed One Piece: Gold. It&#039;s funny. The action was perfect either. The fights are amazing as always.<br />
<br />
Watch this movie! I am sure you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review392449">

    As a One Piece fan, you may look at this movie from different prospectives: At one side, a manga reader will complain about the story, or about its consistency. An anime fan may look at it and think &quot;Wow, so this is where the budget was going to&quot;. While a casual fan will probably simply enjoy it and not think too much about it. On my point of view, I cannot consider this movie a 10/10 for various reasons, but first, let&#039;s talk about what it was good:<br />
<br />
SOUND/MUSIC:<br />
I honestly cannot find anything to complain here. The soundtrack was really good, it goes perfectly and smoothly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239023">
        with each transition. We have old style Toei sound effects that never get old and make some sequences and attacks look badass as usual. Voice acting on point. Nothing negative here. <br />
<br />
ART/ANIMATION:<br />
I noticed I fairly big amount of CGI mixed with the drawn characters and objects. Sometimes it&#039;s too overwhelming, especially when there are several shots of background and scenery that barely have any artwork in it, definitely not amazing. However, the animation itself was nearly flawless, a good thing from Toei, out of every studio... The whole thing was colored and animated very well, there are good switches of light and tonality in each scene, and I was glad to see that I could enjoy some One Piece without any derpy face or bad drawn limb to worry about. <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
Now, there are a few things to consider here. Despite I can&#039;t say that the characters introduced in this movie are as good as some very memorable canon characters, I can see the issue of writing a character and expose it in a 2 hours movie, which definitely it&#039;s not enough, but I found a couple of them pretty likable. The villain of the movie, who by the way is introduced before the main characters, is kinda overpowered in his own way, but has a charm of his own, even though, as I mentioned before, he doesn&#039;t compare to canon villains, he still was a lot better than Hody Jones. I loved seeing certain characters of the canonical story getting involved. Despite the short screentime, it felt more connected to the rest.  As for the main cast, I kinda saw Luffy out of character a few times, especially at the start, but then everything went back to normal once the plot kicked in. Speaking of which... <br />
<br />
STORY/PLOT:<br />
The plot isn&#039;t particularly different from other One Piece arcs. Which consists in getting into a new island, getting involved in a few shenenigans and kick the bad guy&#039;s ass. I appreciated a lot the how they came up with the whole concept of the island, and how it works. There were a few creative powers introduced, and I liked their use. The actual story kicks in around the 40th minute mark, in which the whole movie gets more interesting. Before that mark it&#039;s all about establishing how things are, and the crew fooling around. The concept that the movie talks about, slavery, greed, power, injustice etc... are nothing new to the series. Although more subtle than usual, they were there. Just for a change, One Piece mixed itself with Mission Impossible and Ocean 11, and I can&#039;t lie that it was pretty funny. Even though it&#039;s not its strong point, the plot is quite bareble, quite out of nowhere, takes a few twists, and it gets triggered in a way I honestly did not like. The ending, I liked it. It wasn&#039;t anything amazing, but at least put a smile on my face. Not really much I can say, since it&#039;s not tied with outside events and it&#039;s palpable in the execution of the movie itself. <br />
<br />
Overall, a very good movie, for the premise and purpose that it had, I can say that I wasn&#039;t disappointed, but neither extremely surprised. I think 8/10 is pretty fair, counting my enjoyment as well. If not, at least a 7 for recognising both good things and bad sides of it. <br />
It was pretty fun, I would probably reccomand it to a fan.

    One piece Film gold i by far my favorite one piece movie but you will notice i still gave it a 8/10 due to the predictable ending and side characters which could&#039;ve played a much better role in the story if introduced well. as well as the way the trailer introduced a few characters which got people exited for only to be disappointed by how small a role they were given.<br />
<br />
Story-   7/10 Good<br />
The story in one piece film gold is well average and meets the other one piece movies standards story well if you loved the story of the past one piece movies

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226839">
        then you will have no problem with this one. Rather than following a completely original narrative like previous films Z and Strong World, One Piece Film: Gold uses the typical story-arc structure seen in such arcs as Thriller Bark and Punk Hazard.<br />
<br />
Art- 9/10 Great<br />
as a person who watches one piece weekly it was amazing to see the straw hat pirates gloriously animated after being stuck with less then acceptable animation weekly<br />
<br />
sound- 9/10 Great<br />
The soundtrack for one piece film gold is above average not saying that the normal one piece soundtrack is bad i love it just as much as the one in film gold. compared to the other one piece movies soundtrack this one is so much better.<br />
<br />
Characters- 7/10 good<br />
Although i like the gild tesoro he was pure entertainment but next to Shiki and Z who are legendary characters in the one piece universe he cant compare to the two And some characters were huge disappointments as i mentioned in the beginning i wont say who to avoid spoilers but i thing people who watch the movie can agree with me. and side characters who could&#039;ve been introduced in a better way as for the outfits tesoro and Robins were the ones to me stood out the most.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- 8/10 very good<br />
One piece Film gold Was really Fun the movie starts in and amazing way and ends in predictable but enjoyable fight.<br />
<br />
Overall- 8/10 Very good<br />
The movie was Gold to say the least and i hope every one piece fan will have the chance to watch it the movie also allows people who dont really care about one piece can enjoy the movie but will accept the small amount of spoilers that it has.

    Of all the movie of One Piece I have watched this one is the most luxurious in terms of animation, color and story. The good thing in One Piece is it its flexibility which makes it unpredictable. The art is superb! The cool outfit of the characters is jaw dropping, especially Roronoa Zoro (kyaaaaaaaaaaa) The opening sound is grand and cool with a definitely higher definition of animation. Seiyuu is still the best. The characters are always amazing. I did enjoy watching this one, especially the battle scenes of Roronoa Zoro something to really look forward. Overall, the story ended cleverly and this is something

    A One Piece movie with a final battle that, for once, isn&#039;t that anticlimactic (I&#039;m looking at you, Strong World and Z). <br />
<br />
Story (7)<br />
<br />
One Piece: Gold takes place directly after the Dressrosa arc. Gran Tesoro as an &quot;island&quot; of gold and entertainment is a pretty cool concept, and the beginning is a fun time as the Straw Hats try their hand at a couple of casino games. The Redline-esque Turtle Car Race ft. Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper is a definite highlight of this section, and the suspense is heightened by the fact that, at this point, you&#039;re probably expecting Something To Go Wrong. After all,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297531">
        god forbid this crew to successfully make it out of something loaded with money. <br />
<br />
The Straw Hats have a chill time bumming around and winning lots and lots of Berries, but they eventually realize that something is amiss. As in they get conned and one of their members is abducted. In general there&#039;s nothing particularly original going on here; the writers followed the classic Oda formula of creating a set of oppressed characters deserving of liberation, and it&#039;s up to Luffy and his nakama to do the job. This means taking down a classic OP antagonist--Tesoro himself, who has a heartfelt backstory involving...gold--followed by a series of 1v1 fights near the climax of the movie, with the help of some endearing side characters. As usual, right before the final fight, Luffy yells a couple of lines about how he will protect his nakama while the villain laughs in his face. Despite all of this, the strongest part about Gold&#039;s story *is* its ability to surprise you. The main plot comprises a 10/10 literal heist, followed by a twist towards the end; plus one of the Straw Hats is out of commission for most of the movie and it actually isn&#039;t Nami.<br />
<br />
As far as plot goes: Gold &gt; Strong World &gt;&gt; Z<br />
<br />
Character (6)<br />
<br />
Possibly the weakest point of the movie, but I actually loved how there was so much focus on Nami. And this time, rather than serving a role as the damsel like in Strong World, she somewhat carries the authority of first-mate, which is fitting when you consider the setting. This is partially because the actual first-mate (arguably) is MIA for most of the movie due to Plot. There&#039;s also a bit of Luffy and Franky team up, which made things pretty interesting. The villains are ultimately forgettable, save for the female commander and her DF, but she gets defeated much, much too easily. Tesoro himself has a decent backstory and an OP devil fruit ability, but the latter becomes somewhat useless once we get to the big fight.<br />
<br />
The biggest blow, however, is the fact that none of the other characters get any kind of spotlight. Zoro and Sanji have, like, three lines each, which is a shame (though Zoro does have a cool fight at the end, as usual), and Usopp/Chopper/Robin/Brook are practically nonexistent, solely existing for comedic relief at best. We don&#039;t really get any interesting or exciting interactions between these characters either, not even just fun one-liner exchanges, but I think that&#039;s mainly because it&#039;s not the movie&#039;s focus. Gold is definitely more a plot/action-heavy movie, so if you&#039;re in it for the power of friendship, then you&#039;re better off rewatching Baron Omatsuri.<br />
<br />
Art (8)<br />
<br />
Gran Tesoro comes alive under a beautiful color scheme that only occasionally is hard to look at. The main fights are also animated really well, given the sakuga love that a series like OP deserves. Once again the Straw Hats dress up in badass outfits before taking down the Big Bad, but unlike Strong World and Z, this time there&#039;s actually a point to being all matchy-matchy, which was cool. There&#039;s not much to pick on here, besides that one of the side characters kind of looks like mini-Usopp.<br />
<br />
Sound (8)<br />
<br />
Yuki Hayashi composed the OST and it shows. Meaning that it&#039;s really good. If you liked the final fight in the Boku no Hero Academia movie partly because the score was hype, you&#039;ll probably like this one too. <br />
<br />
Overall (7)<br />
<br />
My second favorite OP film, right behind Baron Omatsuri. Since much of this movie&#039;s focus revolves around gold, thematically it aligns with the Dressrosa arc and what we know of Luffy/Sabo&#039;s backstory. Bonus points for that. All in all though, It&#039;s Entertainment.

    This movie will always be a little special for me. Because It&#039;s the first Anime movie I went to see in theaters. Funimation sent me a notice in my email that it would be entering a limited Dub release into U.S theaters and a quick Google Search showed that it was showing in my local theater.<br />
<br />
And It was good too. Take everything we love about one piece. The Characters, the piracy, the villains, and then add a master thief element. Mix it with the Oceans Movies or the Leverage Tv show and that&#039;s the movie you got. yeah I know Awesome right! I mean we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240981">
        literally had the straw hat&#039;s in a casino pulling a con. They had the whole double reveal and everything It really felt like I was watching a heist movie. <br />
<br />
But that wasn&#039;t all. No One Piece movie works without a good set of villains. You can make or break a one piece move with weak villains. And Gold did it good. They give you a Lady Luck, and even a masochist dude.<br />
<br />
You know that scene in nearly every spy or heist movie that has one of the thieves bungee down from the ceiling?<br />
<br />
Well Gomu Gomu Bungee. that&#039;s all I have left to say.<br />

    Well, be aware that my assessment will focus on the film itself, not the universe from which it came.<br />
History: Not bad though, some points did not allow it to be better, to make it easier to understand: Treasure flashback could have been inserted from the beginning, and being played in parts to the end, this would dexter the character much better. As the subject is history, let&#039;s continue, the story of Carina, not bad, it even links with the Heart Of Gold, and did not make a mistake to put it even being filler, as something real in the work.<br />
What would leave the story better:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302704">
        show the origin of the Treasure, as well as a little more information about the Grand Treasury and its relations with the world.<br />
Art and sound: Absurdly perfect, from the designs, to the animation and the excellent soundtracks, all perfect. I can not find anything to score negatively. Grade 10<br />
Characters: Well, the big problem I saw with the Treasure was to try to turn it into a substitute for Doflamingo, obviously a fanservice, since Mingo was one of One Piece&#039;s most acclaimed villains.<br />
Carina: Not a bad character, she has a VERY charismatic and lovely personality.<br />
The other secondary ones do not have so much importance in the film, except the subordinates of the Treasure, that are not explored, and only served for the final fight.<br />
Maybe, if you put something else in the Treasure, a differential would have been a lot nicer, and as I mentioned up there, Tesoro had all his flashback summarized in a minute, something very disappointing, because even in that little time, you realize the potential that he would have as a character.<br />
Another problem found in this film: the slow narrative, which does not hold the ante for the most part, from the beginning, until near the end. This is really a bad thing, because it hurts the experience with the movie, causing many people not to appreciate the positives and end up &quot;sleeping&quot; in the movie.<br />
Well, before closing, I would like to talk about the Mugiwaras: Well done, more than Film Z, many were important in the script, the big fan service, Gear Fourth, did not disappoint much (note that it&#039;s not a bad thing to be a fan service), the fights were well worked out, and made up for all the boredom the movie can cause.<br />
A good film, however, should be watched without overdoing the expectations.

    My god was that a ride to remember, no really, if anything, these movies were written by Oda are the most I&#039;ve ever seen in the history of anime movies, like for instance, Naruto movies were not that good except for some, but in One Piece, those are shinning like Tesoro&#039;s gold on a dark night.<br />
That was the type of movies you would expect to rewatch at least once a year, while it was slightly different from what a pirate does, it turned out to be a fantastic journey, the humor, twists, backstories, and action are all present, and let me tell you, would you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272244">
        get a huge treat for unique character, someone them will let you wish they were canon, but we&#039;ve got to only have faith in Oda, and he will surely deliver.<br />
<br />
- Story (9/10):<br />
The story of the movie has been teased long before the actual events of the movies started, and it made for heck of an amazing build up, and that had a great reward on itself, like for instance, we heard about Gran Tesoro the first time back on that filler after Dressrosa, the “Sliver Mine” arc, it was a decent one, they kept referencing Tesoro and hyping him up as “The monster of the new world”, and yes, he did live up to that reputation, and then, there was the prequel to the movie, yet another fantastic special, would really recommand it, it was called “Heart of Gold”, it served itself as an amazing teaser too, and then again, there was that “episode 0” special about them going to Gran Tesoro, all of those animations were such a great hype up, leading to the finale, which is this movie.<br />
The movie starts off as the straw hats arrive at Gran Tesoro, the so-called biggest entertainment city in the world, owned by someone that&#039;s not only is recognized as the biggest entertainer but also one of the top richest people that have 20% of all the world&#039;s berries, the so-called king of casinos and gambling, and to our surprise, he has quite the depressing backstory surrounding him as well.<br />
This movie, or at least for me, is quite special, and more distinguishable than others, because, in addition to the adventure, it has an extra “new” element, you get to see some big budget planning for probably one of the biggest thefts in the history of One Piece, you see the straw hats working together as burglar, going undercover, sneaking around and acting according to plane, it really has that big “Ocean&#039;s Eleven” trilogy vibes to it, but ofcourse, there would be a lot of goofying off by the members of the crew at times, but as you should know, when it comes to action, they would break quite the havoc. The world of One Piece seems a lot more massive now that I look at it, how Gran Tesoro is a country on a ship, recognized by the world government, there must be a lot of crazy stuff out there. And the fights were so spot on, as soon as the movie starts, you get to see the straw hats showing off them moves to the public, living up to their reputation, and the matter remains throughout the movie, something else I found intreging is the existence of cars, very odd to see in One Piece, the last time I remember seeing functioning vehicles other than ships, where Ace&#039;s special boat (or whatever it&#039;s called), and Smoker&#039;s bike that run on smoke, that added a lot to the movie, to be honest, the lore was crazy.<br />
<br />
- Art (10/10):<br />
No need to make this over the top, but believe me, those were some crisp looking eye candy right there, and it is expected from such a heavy budget movie of One Piece&#039;s, you better get yourself to immersive that animation, everything looks very fluid, the facial animations, the movements, even the backgrounds feel so much alive, you can get that the world is moving, and people are interacting out of view.<br />
What are very amazing, were the outfits, oh my, it&#039;s been a while since I saw that straw hats in mafia suits back on Film: Strong World, and get this, this movie was no difference, seeing the straw hats in them luxury tuxedos, and the girls in those fashionable dresses, that was amazing, and don&#039;t get me started, how they captured Robin and Nami&#039;s feminine side&#039;s, they were both beautiful.<br />
<br />
- Sound (10/10):<br />
I haven&#039;t been much of a picky guy when it came to the sound effects and music tracks in movies, but ever since the last movie, Film: Z, a new guideline was set off to me, I can&#039;t tolerate pitchily and cheat sound-craft special in heavy budget projects like this one, I expected something big, and boy did I get more than I saw coming, yes, everything from the music, or the most silent wisp of wind, you can see it so clear, the work on the soundtrack was fantastic, for each moment their track, the most sutable you can think about, and let&#039;s not overlook the voice acting here, boy, the cast knows what they&#039;re doing, I&#039;m talking big performance here, even for those side characters, Baccarat did a phenominal job, replicating that accent while speaking some english words, it really captured the type of character she was playing, let&#039;s not forget about Gild himself, that villain laugh of his, second only to Doffy&#039;s.<br />
<br />
- Character (10/10):<br />
I don&#039;t usually give this high score to a movie project when it comes to characters and development giving the time span of the movie and events plus, most of the time, your characters are your usual straw hat members, but this movie falls into a special case, filled with new faces as well as very familiar ones, I spotted a lot of them in fact that I am pretty sure I could have missed a few.<br />
Let&#039;s talk about Carina for a second, a match for Nami, she was shown for a very brief shot on the prequel special for this movie, “Heart of Gold”. Foreshadowing her coming, and there she is, sharing a past with our cat burglar, they both shine in the profession (can I even call it that?), she was clearly in the spotlights, manages to steal your attention for once, the same can be told about Tesoro, as I mentioned before, the monster of the new world, totally lives up to his potential, and really seemed like a threat to the crew members, his ideology blent so well with his past, and his resulting present.<br />
Among many amazing characters, there was one specific annoying individual that appeared on the first even teaser of the movie on that “Silver Mine” arc, that cat looking man, or is it a man looking cat? Whatever he is, he was a nuisance.<br />
As I said earlier, in addition to those new characters, we got to see old ones, like Spandam, and Lucci, there was also Absalom and that guy from cypher pole whole Sanji fought on the train heading to Eniese Lobby whom he had to structure his face for a chance, it really makes you wonder about the odds. There was also Sabo and Koala, let&#039;s not forget Akainu too.<br />
<br />
- Enjoyment (10/10):<br />
Like the action-adventure-comedy-thrill loved I am, I enjoyed the heck out of this movie, the 2 hours animation felt like a journey, that ended very fast, time sure passes when you have fun the most huh!!<br />
I would like to see upcoming movies of the same quality, that would be quite the treat, to be honest, it&#039;s been a while since I watched a movie and ended up liking it, this one is out there among the best of the best.<br />
<br />
- Overall(9.8/10):<br />
Thye way this movie is, makes me want to recommend it even to the non-One-Piece-fans, it would even pull people to getting into One Piece, I pinned this to my to-watch-list 6 months ago, and I&#039;m wondering why I have ignored it this whole time, totally a worth watching movie.

    Art (7): One of One Piece animation&#039;s key points is the vibrant colors and in this case, GOLD. In this movie, lighting and contrast is too bright which can be regarded as eye candy. As for the character design, the women&#039;s designs are exaggerated to some degree especially their breasts. One of the notable parts of this movie is the action scenes which was animated quite well. Other than that. compared to the previous movies that Oda supervised and helped create, this lacks a bit in the animation side. <br />
<br />
Sound (10): What I enjoyed the most in this movie is the music. From upbeat sound

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244550">
        to mellow ones, they create the atmosphere perfect for the scenes. From the introduction to the end, the music is one of the parts that is well done in the movie.<br />
<br />
Character (6): To avoid spoilers, I will try to keep this short and just give subtle hints. Three of the strawhats have a bigger role than the others and is elaborated a bit but other than that, nothing changed. The characters were consistent (assuming since this is a movie, character developments are not that much. As for the new characters, they are very straight-forward and a bit bland. <br />

Story (6): The movie is the same with the other One Piece Films which always introduce the villain first before our main characters. A common thread in the OP movies as well is the number of antagonists to which the strawhats would individually defeat with the Monster Trio getting most of the spotlight. The movie doesn&#039;t really depict much of the pirate-ish vibe of the strawhat since the setting is a bit more modern and doesn&#039;t center much around their piracy. There are bits and pieces for the side characters but doesn&#039;t get much hype at all.

    As a manga only reader since around the Fishman Island anime airing and being caught up and a fan since Sabaody, this is a pure breath of fresh air. This movie is truly an enjoyable, bite-sized, One Piece story to its core. A story like this is something that has been absent from One Piece since entering the New World. <br />
This is my first review ever, and my first time watching animated One Piece in about 8 years, so please excuse the roughness.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
<br />
A heist is the perfect setting for the Straw Hat Crew to explore within the confines of a movie. It&#039;s great to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361750">
        see Nami come back to her cat burglar roots and become a primary motif of this movie. The story flows perfectly like any of the other great arcs that precede it. A funky island is stumbled upon, the Straw Hats get to flex, they get baited in, and they get trapped. The character interactions and the general vibe of this however feel like a story out of the East Blue. The stakes are much lower, the crew is more bubbly, and more shenanigans are occurring. The story was extremely simple and it was perfect in that way. If you&#039;re a weekly manga reader, you understand how intense and dire the series has gotten, and we are sorely missing some pure Straw Hat synergy. The simplicity and linear nature of this particular story still do not take away from the gravity, emotion, and intensity it is able to provide. It all feels nostalgic, natural, and normal, and I love it.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
<br />
Where I left off in the anime, there was a lot to be desired in the art department. It was one of the main reasons I migrated to reading this series instead. Obviously, movies have more recoursed put behind them than a weekly episode, but damn this is what I wish One Piece would look like every episode. Seeing things like Usopp, Zoro, Luffy, and the main villain duke things out in such crispy smooth animation felt so good. The environment as well, it was like a golden cyberpunk casino utopia and it was eye candy the entire duration of the movie. It is always a joy to see what kind of One Piece crazy technology gets invented, implemented, and integrated into the landscapes of this world. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10 <br />
<br />
Not much to say here. Just all around blood-pumping music. When the song in the final fight hit, IT HIT. The One Piece normal OST has honestly never really stood out to me, especially compared to its contemporaries like Naruto and Bleach, but it definitely stepped it up far past my expectations and memory for this film. <br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
<br />
In this movie, we have the joy to spend time with some characters who have been sorely neglected in recent times. Specifically Nami, Usopp, and Franky. Sure Zoro and Luffy got almost completely sidelined, but that&#039;s okay. The Straw Hat crew are all equally lovable to me, and the new characters that are primarily focused on are also entertaining. Nami gets time to be more than a pair of boobs with a compass and returns to her sly cat burglar roots, carrying some of the highest intensity and highest emotional parts of the story. I never knew I needed a Luffy and Franky covert ops mission, but now I know I did. I don&#039;t think they have ever spent time exclusively together and it felt great. Luffy freaking out about the toilet plunger grappling hooks were perfect. And my boy Usopp finally busted out so many more gag weapons, has it seriously been since thriller bark that he has used weapons like these? Wow I&#039;m old, I got more of an Alabasta vibe from them though. The new characters introduced were all interesting, with creative powers, and felt like natural inhabitants of the One Piece seas. My only nitpick is that I think we should have seen more color of the kings haki.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
As being the first animation I have watched of One Piece in about 8 years, I am extremely happy. I truly left watching this series with a sour taste in my mouth, and I am especially happy I didn&#039;t stick around to weekly watchings of Dresrosa (even though it&#039;s in my top 3 arcs now). This felt like a breath of fresh air to me. A break from the Wano drama and high stakes, and a trip back in time to when things were more light-hearted. I genuinely laughed many times throughout this movie, thanks Franky, Usopp and Brook especially. My heart strings were pulled in regards to Nami&#039;s new backstory. And I was invested in what kind of show the villain had for us in store next. <br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
<br />
Out of any anime movie I have that comes from an already existing series, this might just be my favorite. I feel like it is really hard to correctly divert from a story that you&#039;re so invested in, and Oda has blown me away again. You can truly feel how involved he is in this project, and it pays off. I just had so much fun and had a big dumb smile on my face almost the entire time. It is hard to go wrong when you get the whole Straw Hat crew together for a party city heist.
