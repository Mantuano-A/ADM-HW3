    Akagi is based around its titular character gambling his way to the top of the underworld, his enigmatic prowess for mahjong often turning the tide of certain defeat into victory. Akagi is a cold, relentless character. He cares little for money or for his own life. In the heat of the gamble he stops at nothing less than completely crushing his opponent&#039;s will to win...<br />
<br />
Akagi is the first Nobuyuki Fukumoto manga to get the anime treatment and the anime has been executed surprisingly well. It is with reason that I say, &#039;surprisingly&#039;. When considering Fukumoto&#039;s original, while particulary famous in Japan and Korea, you can&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1965">
        help but think that it would be very difficult to animate it well enough to make it appeal to a wide audience. <br />
<br />
Firstly there is the subject matter, Akagi (the anime), as with a number of other works by Fukumoto, basically involves Akagi (the character) playing a couple of games of the Japanese version of mahjong, gambling for keeps. Next Madhouse have kept (thankfully) with Fukumoto&#039;s original art style, with all of its unconventional flourishes (read; big noses etc.). And finally, the lead character, Akagi, is not exactly the easiest character in the world to relate to. In short, he is out of this world, nothing short of a true &amp;quot;God of Gamblers&amp;quot;. <br />
<br />
With all of this in mind it is &#039;surprising&#039; just how intense this anime is. In the next couple of paragraphs I&#039;ll try and breakdown how this anime overcomes all of the above, making it one of the most original, mind-numbingly insane animes in a long, long time. <br />
<br />
Firstly the mahjong. I have to admit that when I first started watching this anime I knew nothing about mahjong in general, let alone the Japanese version. The good news is that it doesn&#039;t really matter. The basic goal of the game and the rules are subtly explained as the anime progresses, and while it does help learn a bit about the different &#039;hands&#039; everyone is going for it is definitely not a pre-requisite. You see, mahjong is game based on points so it is always pretty obvious who is in the lead, what kind of a hand Akagi needs to win the game etc. The finer points of mahjong all seem to come in to place as the games progress. The anime&#039;s direction involves a lot of internal dialogue. The audience is always privy to each characters&#039; thoughts, allowing them to (conveniently) tell the viewer what kind of tile the character in question is waiting for, the number of points the hand they are going for will land them etc. <br />
<br />
Fear not, I can wholeheartedly say that the mahjong in this anime does not form an obstacle in the enjoyment of the anime in any way, shape or form. Like me, you&#039;ll probably get really into the game as you watch - The danger associated with having to throw away your tiles (with the possibility of the tile being picked up and used by your opponent as his victory tile) makes the game, and this anime truly absorbing to watch.<br />
<br />
The mahjong battles are awesome, leaving you on the edge of your seat the whole time, however the real reason that the mahjong battles draw the viewer in is the interaction between characters, or more specifically, the carefully constructed psychological battles that are played out before our eyes.<br />
<br />
The characters cannot be mentioned without some reference to the drawing style, which plays a large role in creating the tone of the series. As with anything Fukumoto, the character designs do take a little getting used to. Yes the characters do possess noses so large that Pinocchio would be put to shame. Yes the characters in general are kind of... angular. Yes there are no busty 2D babes providing you 13 year olds with fan service - Okay, deep breaths, deep breaths... If you watch this anime past the first episode you will (hopefully) realize that these features ARE NOT necessarily bad things.<br />
<br />
Firstly the originality really makes it stand out, and as you watch further into the series you begin to realize that the character designs do actually really suit the whole grim, macabre feel of the anime - hey, we&#039;re talking about a bunch of men gambling with more than money, with their very lives here -  it&#039;s not exactly The Brady Bunch... Trust me, by the time the anime ends you will think that the character design presented in Akagi is the ONLY true way you could represent the vile, ugly nature of underworld thugs. Personally, I love Fukumoto&#039;s ouevre. The characters are very expressive and the drawing style is perfectly combined with Hideki Taneuchi&#039;s brooding score to paint an intensely bleak pictue of the Japanese underworld circa the 1960&#039;s. I&#039;m giving art and sound a 10.<br />
<br />
Next, on to Akagi the character. He is a prodigy, an enigma - put bluntly, you are going to have a hard time understanding what he is going through. This is both a good and a bad thing. In a way his absoluteness, his superhuman insight wraps Akagi in a veil of mystery and, to paraphase the Fonz, is what gives him &#039;his cool&#039;. On the other hand, when the anime ends you feel like you still don&#039;t really know anything about him at all. His existence in the anime is kind of like that of a mystery film. He reveals a little of his character, answering one question, only to pose two more... <br />
<br />
Now I like a piece of entertainment that doesn&#039;t completely reveal itself to the audience, making each and every one of us think for ourselves about the story&#039;s meaning, about what happens next. With Akagi however, this is taken to the extreme. The anime just kind of ends (mid-match). I know, that this is not really the fault of the animators as the original manga had still not ended its run. (At the time of writing the manga is up to 20 volumes and is still ongoing -  the anime version of Akagi ends at the start of volume 13). Having said that though I kind of wished that the animators would have veered from the original manga a bit towards the end, to give it a proper ending. <br />
<br />
For me personally it is such a shame that such an epic anime ends with not a bang, but a whimper, and it has a point taken off it for that... I hold out hope that there is a second season (it doesn&#039;t look likely though).<br />
<br />
While my review does end on kind of a sour note, let it be known that up until the ending this anime is pure gold, definitely a must see. If it is the mahjong or the character design holding you back, I urge you to give it a try - if you dismiss this one on face value you&#039;ll only be missing out on one of the most original, nail-bitingly intense anime series around. (No real biggie:)

    Akagi. Once again, I&#039;m strung into a series by merely the name and a brief introduction summary.Well yes, &amp;quot;Akagi&amp;quot; isn&#039;t all that of an awesome name in itself, but where I came upon it it was named &amp;quot;Touhai Densetsu Akagi - Yami ni Maiorita Tensai&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Gambler Genius Akagi - The Legend who Descended into the Darkness&amp;quot;. Well, with reservation for translation. In any case, I acquired an episode to have a gander at what an Anime mainly about Mahjong could be able to offer...and if I&#039;d be able to learn anything in the process.<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
Akagi Shigeru, a thirteen year old daredevil with an unknown background,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9886">
        stumbles in on a Yakuza quarter, right in the midst of a Mahjong battle. This is the birth of a new legend, as the narrator states, and Akagi has never played Mahjong in his entire life - yet, when taught the basics and (by a fluke) given a chance for a test round, he appears to play like a professional already. And this is just the beginning of the story, as it advances hastily through his career life as an underground genius, who uses clever strategies as well as dirty tricks to win his games.<br />
<br />
The layout reminded me a lot about strategy Anime shows, such as Death Note, mainly, even though the stories differ greatly. The main character has a very fuzzy alignment; you can&#039;t quite put your finger on if he&#039;s really good or evil. He uses strategic tricks that the usual commoner would never have thought about, and the show even goes so far as to explain most of the tricks he pull, and how he reasons when reading the other people by the Mahjong table. And we mustn&#039;t forget about the thick layer of special effects that makes the simplest game of Mahjong into a battle of life and death (or worse) (see more under &amp;quot;Enjoyment&amp;quot;). Also, it&#039;s not solely based on Mahjong, as the main character is an overall gambler, so we&#039;re also acquainted with a streak of Russian roulette and the Japanese dice game Chouhan.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
Yes, it&#039;s an incredible number I&#039;m giving this one point, considering the first thought that probably pops up into most of people&#039;s heads as they see the first episode...&amp;quot;these characters are butt ugly.&amp;quot; Yeah, that was my initial thought as well. But, it didn&#039;t take all that long before I actually got used to this unique drawing style, and came to like it more and more as the show progressed. The rest of the artwork - the backgrounds, the Mahjong tiles - absolutely flawless. When Akagi is faced with a round of the special Washizu Mahjong, where 75% of the tiles are transparent, the rendering of these tiles is simply stunning. And during the dramatic scenes (and there are a few, trust me), the animation goes smooth as silk.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Akagi&#039;s voice couldn&#039;t be better for the role he plays. Silent, yet sharp. And I imagine his snicker can send icicles down any opponent&#039;s spine. No voice actors are especially bad, the music blends in well with the show, and the opening/ending sequences fit very good as well (The opening sequence can sound annoying the first few times, but it really grows on you if you listen to it a few times more). The one thing that racks this score down is that 1)The show has a narrator, 2)He talks a whole lot, and 3)He has a nasal, close to soulless voice. It kinda ruins the effect on the drama that takes place.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
It&#039;s easy reading the characters out, because each of them has a very distinct style of acting. There&#039;s the insane gambler Washizu, the dirty cop Yasuoka, the calm top-player Ichikawa and the young and nervous Osamu, among other colorful and charismatic personalities. And Akagi himself is deceitful, perceptive and willing to risk his life for the game...and probably one of the coolest motherf@$kers I&#039;ve ever seen in action. &amp;lt;/personalopinion&amp;gt;<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
Man, what can I say. It&#039;s been a long time since an Anime strung me in so tightly right from the very beginning. The dramatic effect factor plays a large role here - pauses are elongated to create the perfect amount of tension, the Mahjong tiles crash down on the playing table like meteors when played out, and the camera pans in on the facials to capture every drop of agony and clenching there is. And the flow of the story is as good as it can get...or, well, could have been. However, at the last six or so episodes, it stops to what almost feels like a complete halt, during the last, intense game we see Akagi play. It drags along painfully slowly, each tile taking forever to draw and collect/discard, and cuts off short at the last episode at a very abrupt ending, dislocating the otherwise so nice pace the Anime had. Hadn&#039;t it been for this snailing in the end, I would probably have rated the show a ten (yes, even considering the narrator), but I cannot allow myself to such for this.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
Overall? A must see. If you&#039;re into an Anime with knife-sharp strategy and high stakes, this is your pick. And if you manage to acquire Triad&#039;s subtitling, they&#039;ll provide you with helpful translator notes along the way regarding the Mahjong games (boy, I dunno where I&#039;d been if I wouldn&#039;t have had them), if it&#039;s unfamiliar terrain for you. Yes, I learned a few bits and pieces about the game, and experienced a great Anime to boot.

    Mahjong:<br />
For those, who don&#039;t know what it majong, it&#039;s rather special hazard game, similar to poker, but played with special tiles. There are manzi, pinzi, sanzi, dragon and wind tiles. You must get special hands to win. It&#039;s not difficult game and when you play it yourself (either irl or on computer) it&#039;s quite addictive. <br />
<br />
Story and Characters:<br />
Basically, there is no standard story. Whole plot is about mahjong games, which take few episodes to resolve. Though there is time flow, it&#039;s nothing as standard action story. But this story is all about one person. Shigeru Akagi is his name. Whole story twists around him, each

          <span style="display: none;" id="review887">
        episode shows his greatness. Yes, he is more than human, he is god. You must see it yourself, how gar he is, in each play of mahjong he participate. <br />
<br />
Art and sound:<br />
Animation is very good. But character design is very different than usual manga style. First thing you will see is rather big nose. But animation of mahjong tiles is incredible, they totally feel like alive.<br />
<br />
I was prejudiced, biased over character design and the fact that anime is about mahjong before I saw it. But I was wrong, sooo wrong. But when I saw first episode later, I knew, it will be the best what I have seen so far (along with Higurashi). Try it yourself, every person who did this, will say the same words as I do.

    What would you do if you are faced with death? Would you have the guts to make it out alive or would you become numb and frozen in the moment that you stop thinking completely and succumb to death? Well whatever your answer maybe, it seems that Akagi, the series&#039; main focus, always has a way out whether it be a reckless move or a calm and composed one. <br />
<br />
The year is 1958, in the dark streets of Japan and in the middle of what seems to be a very long night for Nangou, a neurotic and addictive gambler who is in the verge of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191637">
        losing his life after the debts stack up against him in a game of Mahjong, versus the shady and infamous Yakuza gang. But unknown to him, in a different scenario a man survives a near death experience after playing a game of chicken, in which two different persons drive a car all the only to brake at the right time in order to avoid falling off from a cliff and lose their life. It happens to be that one of the two participants from the game of chicken has lost his life and the other is on the run after surviving even though falling off from the cliff. This makes the cop, Yasuoka, to go after this survivor in order to arrest him. Back to the Mahjong battle against the Yakuza gang, Nangou only moves even more closer to his death and away his prize money which would clear all of his debt in one go. If something called luck existed, it was completely absent in Nangou&#039;s game. All hope seems lost for him with his life lingering in the hands of the outcome of the game and as death seems inevitable, something unexpected happens. The chicken survivor, who is actually our protagonist from the show Akagi, is on the run from the police and intrudes upon the parlour where Nangou is playing a seemingly valueless game with victory nowhere near in sight. There is a knock from the door which gives a momentarily relief for Nangou as one of the gang members stands up and heads for the door. It&#039;s a young man seeking refuge from the gang, but is instantly denied entrance and is told to go away at once. But Nangou then disrupts the member saying he was one of his underlings he had called for when he was away from home for a long time, but in the truth it was nothing but an attempt to get hold of as much time as Nangou could to think of a way to get back in the game. <br />
<br />
Nangou sits back and relaxes for a while asking who the young man was explaining the circumstances of his seemingly in vain Mahjong battle to him. Akagi tells everything about him and how he was on the run from the police before running into Nangou. He also gives Nangou a piece of advice, saying that all he could sense in his game play was an aura brimming with fear and no real winning sense. Nangou senses something from Akagi as well. From his personality he feels that he might be able to overturn the game on its head and get Nangou away from death. He explains the basic rules of Mahjong to Akagi, who at the time is completely unbeknownst of the rules of the game. Akagi then sits down to play the game while the gang members could only laugh it off as how a thirteen-year old (Oh shit! Did I forget to mention he was freaking 13?! Well if you just started the anime it&#039;s not that much of a  surprise after seeing the art style. I literally laughed my ass out at first when he mentioned he was 13 years of age for as he looked to me he was over 25+!) could defeat them. However this was just a start of a new legend that would succumb into the darkness. Akagi is able to defeat the Yakuza members and save Nangou off his troubles and in the meantime defeated Yagi, a representative player of the Yakuza gang and with it mark his first ever professional victory as a gambler. <br />
<br />
Uptil now you must&#039;ve learned more about Akagi Shigeru. He is a thirteen year old natural-born gambler who exceeds all expectations and uses any kinds of mean and shrewd tactics to pull off the game. Sometimes he goes to even an extent that he doesn&#039;t have any regards for his own life. Nangou is one of the earliest characters in the anime, an addictive but a coward gambler who gets caught in a cat and mouse game against the Yakuza gang members. But luckily for him, Akagi is able to beat them and save Nangou&#039;s life, after which he decides to never gamble for money again. A lesson well learnt. Another main character who is featured frequently in the series is the cop-turned-gambler, Yasuoka. He&#039;s the cop that chases Akagi into the parlour and witnesses his match against the Yakuza members. He quickly comes to learn that however he maybe young, he is a devil inside that has unthinkable tricks up his sleeve and is a genius in the making.<br />
<br />
After the antics of Akagi facing off and winning against the Yakuza members, his next challenge awaits him. Ichikawa is a man in his fifties, blind, yet considered a master in Mahjong. This forecasts an incredible battle between the two with Akagi coming out as the victor amidst extreme tension. This helps cast Akagi as a genius totally unrivaled, unsurpassed and invincible in the format of gambling. Although after his victory against Ichikawa, Akagi quickly disappears into the darkness only to be found five years later by a member of the Yakuza gang. He comes to know that Yasuoka the cop has set up a fake Akagi who seems to be as good the real one, and a showdown against the two awaits. Osamu is another young, amateur Mahjong player working with Akagi in a factory and who keeps follwing Akagi wherever he goes. His main role in the show is to play against Urabe, a gambler who is facing Fake Akagi before his showdown against the real Akagi. Unknown to him that there&#039;s a great amount of money involved in the gamble, Osamu actually fares pretty well against Urabe before learning the fact that 32 million yen is on the line. Akagi then interferes him and plays his own battle against Urabe. He is able to defeat Urabe and make him pay his socks off for the amount of money, while making us learn that Osamu was actually made to play to manipulate Urabe and learn more about his skills and habits on the game. He comes to know that Urabe is the type of the guy who waits and see&#039;s his opponent through and does not rush towards victory. It&#039;s actually a shame that Osamu is nowhere to be seen in the second cour of the show as he had a likeable personality. <br />
<br />
Well after his tie against Urabe, Akagi, seeking a game where one would bet his own destruction, now moves forward to face his final opponent, the lunatic Washizu Iwao. Washizu Iwao is a former World War veteran, a retired police sergeant who had made a great deal of money, an amount more than enough required in one&#039;s life. He also has the upper hand over all the politicians and has all the means to rule the nation from the underworld. He is a dark leader. Washizu&#039;s style of Mahjong play is quite different from the usual. Transparent tiles which can been seen through completely is used for play among a few opaque tiles. Washizu succeeds at defeating various players and attains a legendary status who has never lost in Mahjong. That is before he faces against Akagi.  <br />
The anime focuses on the growth of Akagi as a Mahjong gambler, and his earlier and younger days in the first part of the show and also his matches against various oppositions before he faces against Washizu Iwao, his final opponent of the series. Whereas in the next 13 episodes the show completely revolves around the tie against Akagi and Washizu lasting for six sessions. It actually gets kind of repetitive after the 13 episode mark. With all the development from start of the show, they could&#039;ve made it last a little longer but everything&#039;s hurried a bit and ended before the second cour of the show begins. This honestly weights down the show a little, because it has such a gripping story from the start, even the ending is a bit abrupt. <br />
<br />
The artwork of the show is quite unsurprisingly the most talked about factor by both the people who have watched it and not yet watched it. However if that&#039;s a reason that you&#039;re holding back on watching this show I&#039;d suggest you drop that idea at once. <br />
Sure, the art is... well, crazy to say the least. It takes time for you to getting used to but it infact supports the psychological and intense nature of the show. For a protagonist who is 13, but quite obviously looks 25+, you get the idea that this isn&#039;t a show in a stage which could be said ordinary. Infact, this is a completely different Seinen from others not only because it tackles about gambling, but does it in a most unorthodox way. This way it&#039;s quite true that the art style is the most suitable for this kind of anime. <br />
Even for the transparent Mahjong tiles, the effects are beautifully done. The backgrounds have a perfect synchronization to the timeline this anime revolves around, in the 1960&#039;s. <br />
<br />
Moving on to the sound aspects of the show. Akagi is voiced by Hagiwara Masato who did the voice acting for Tokuchi Toua as well, the protagonist from One Outs. Akagi&#039;s voice has a prominent gambling type of fathom in it. It&#039;s as if Hagiwara has a natural-born skill for voice acting gambling roles. His three famous voice-roles that of Kaiji, Tokuchi and Akagi are all protagonists  in any form of gambling. The soundtracks in the anime is done pretty well, with tones adjusted to the tense nature of the show. The opening track remains the same throughout the show and is of a traditional japanese accent which only adds to its premise. The first ending is done by Maximum the  Hormone, more famously known for the second opening in Death Note. The second ending is glorious as well. The visuals are what I really like from the second ending. They accompany the track extremely well and I would pay to watch that majestic walk on a railway track from Akagi. The next thing I&#039;d like to depict is the voice by the narrator. While not over the top perfect, he does his job of explaining the stuff happening pretty well without over-exaggerating. There have been various anime that have succeeded using the narrator for the most part, and while the narrator for Akagi doesn&#039;t add to any further reputations for the show, he works on his part pretty well. <br />
<br />
I will finish off by saying Touhai Densetsu Akagi: Yami ni Maiorita Tensai is a supreme and classic Seinen about gambling which is executed brilliantly right from the start. A lot of people may not be daring to go into this one because of the concept its made around, the game of Mahjong. While it would certainly help if you knew a little about the game, but even if you are a newbie to it like myself, you&#039;d still be able to comprehend given you give complete attention to the translator notes and the rest of it is explained pretty well by the narrator himself. <br />

    Akagi is a Psychological, Sports, Drama about the somewhat unfamiliar game of &amp;ldquo;Japanese Mahjong&amp;rdquo;, which manages to capitalize on tension and thrills but it can only be truly enjoyed by the open-minded anime fan (knowledge on Mahjong not required).<br />
<br />
The story itself revolves around a deceptively young-looking, young boy (Shigeru Akagi), who is a prodigy at the game Mahjong. The good thing is that you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need to know a thing about Mahjong to watch this; you just need to grasp the basic concept in the first couple episodes. The storyline follows Akagi&amp;rsquo;s numerous accomplishments in Mahjong, as the stakes get higher and higher. This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4094">
        formula is fairly repetitive, as each time there&amp;rsquo;s a match with a tougher opponent but it proves effective. That is until the final match, which ended up being dragged on for almost half the show and didn&amp;rsquo;t come to a completely fulfilling end.<br />
<br />
The characters of the series are all rather one-dimensional and don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily change or develop as the show goes on, yet Akagi proved to be the only exception. It is pretty hard to find a character that we know what he/she&amp;rsquo;s thinking; yet is so mysterious, unpredictable and genuinely crazy as Akagi. Apart from that Akagi lacks some depth and any explanation into why he is like that.<br />
<br />
The animation for this series is great. A good amount of detail is put into the realistic environments to suit the gritty theme and everything on the screen moves fluidly. Also whenever a game of Mahjong kicks in we get a taste of appropriately used CG that mixes well with the drawn animation. The only issue I have is with the unique but plain ugly character designs; however this can be overlooked due to the nature of the series.<br />
<br />
The music on the other hand is the one aspect that I can confidentially say is perfect. The throbbing bass line tunes and sombre guitar melodies go so well with the series and it even helps to intensify the mundane game of Mahjong.<br />
<br />
Overall Akagi proved to be fairly entertaining series that transformed such an unexciting game into an intense, psychological, drama. This series had a great sense of imagery as during the matches; every important action is backed by some metaphorical reference. However this has a problem of stopping the flow of the match, especially during the extremely long final match. So if you think you can still enjoy this series then check it out, but first be sure to create some room in your brain for the many complex rules of the game.<br />
<br />

    Alright. I can&#039;t even do a conventional review for this shit! This is the most confusing anime I&#039;ve ever seen in my life. It&#039;s well directed, well animated, and seems to build decent drama. I just have no earthly idea what the fuck is going on!<br />
<br />
Did you think End of Evangelion was a little confusing? Maybe you weren&#039;t paying close enough attention and you somehow missed what LCL is. &quot;I wanted to watch this for the robot battles and hot chicks, why is everyone exploding into orange goop now?!&quot; Maybe you&#039;re asking stuff like &quot;Is this happening during episodes 25 and 26 in Shinji&#039;s head?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318856">
        &quot;If Seele always wanted to implement the human instrumentality project, why did they wait this long and provide funding for NERV, who is antithetical to their goals?&quot; &quot;Why did Shinji choke Asuka and then stop?&quot;<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t worry! Evageeks forum can provide all these answers in 5 minutes. You don&#039;t even have to suffer a mild headache. Don&#039;t like reading? No problem! There are 200 different video essays on YouTube that explain all of these plot points so that even a small child could understand them in 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s imagine you aren&#039;t an old Asian lady and don&#039;t know how to play Mahjong. Too bad! YOU. ARE. FUCKED! Akagi is NOT here to hold your hand and teach you basics. Akagi ain&#039;t like most sports anime. Ping Pong the Animation isn&#039;t really about Ping Pong. They go into basic details about the sport, but it&#039;s really a psychological drama and coming of age story. Yuri on Ice isn&#039;t really about figure skating. They explain some basic stuff about the scoring system and tournament system, but it&#039;s really a mushy romance coupled together with a story about a depressed young adult gaining his confidence and drive back. Akagi is about Mahjong. In depth, super technical, professional level Mahjong. If you don&#039;t want this anime to skull-fuck you, it&#039;s required to spend at LEAST 25 hours researching the ludicrously overcomplicated and confusing rules of Mahjong. How easy is it to learn Mahjong? Combine the complexity and staggering amount of rules from Magic the Gathering with 2 semesters of organic chemistry, and you&#039;re almost at the level of Mahjong. <br />
<br />
Imagine the Insane Clown Posse attending a particle physics lecture on electron spin, so they can finally understand how magnets works. At the end of that 2 hour lecture, they would be less confused than the average non-Asian person after an episode of Akagi. I&#039;m not even joking. It&#039;s honest to God that bad!<br />
<br />
So why a 6? I actually think if I understood Mahjong I might enjoy this. I liked Kaiji well enough and the same director has brought the same signature style here. It gets rather silly and almost Yu-gi-Oh-esque with the shocked expressions and bombastic presentation, but that&#039;s just the original author doing his thing. The series just wants to accurately capture the manga and from what I saw at a glance, it appears to be doing a great job. Madhouse delivered as they typically do and I have no complaints from a visual perspective. Not every piece work is made for all audiences. If you don&#039;t know Mahjong, this series was NOT made for you. Giving Akagi a low rating is like me going on Goodreads and giving a low rating to some Rabbinic essay on the Midrash that was written in Yiddish 400 years ago in Poland. The author of that scholarly work didn&#039;t write it for me, so it doesn&#039;t matter if I didn&#039;t understand it. That&#039;s basically Akagi.

    Oh, Akagi... Akagi, Akagi, Akagi... What can I say? This is the first Anime that I have ever seen that dealt with gambling. The means of gambling is with a game called Mahjong. I did not know the fundamentals and basic rules of Mahjong when I watched this. Looking back at it, I certainly wished I had taken the time to learn Mahjong. The reason for this is because all Akagi did was left me with numerous boring moments, frustration, and a bitter taste in my mouth. And maybe, just maybe I could have appreciated and enjoyed Akagi a little bit more, but it&#039;s just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30429">
        not that great folks. I&#039;m sorry. On to the review...<br />
<br />
STORY... As mentioned earlier, the plot revolves around Mahjong. There are a total of 3 arcs, if I remember correctly, and within each arc, the ante is raised to a higher level which keeps things interesting. The setup of the plot to me was great, but the execution of the plot was not well done. There are numerous instances wherein there is internal dialogue. It happens when the players are thinking to themselves. For example, what&#039;s their opponent&#039;s next move, what&#039;s the best move for them, and when they start panicking. Now, these are great ways to build &quot;on the edge of your seat tension&quot; and it works for the first few episodes, but they just overdid it with the rest of the episodes. Imagine taking 2, sometimes even 3 whole episodes just for a single round. There were so many times I tried so hard not to fall asleep while listening to the characters&#039; internal dialogue. It&#039;s slow paced. Eventually, you&#039;ll come to find out it&#039;s not if Akagi will win, it&#039;s HOW he will win, meaning you know what&#039;s going to happen= predictable. And to make matters worse, Akagi has a very UNSATISFYING ending. Let&#039;s go to the next category before I start ranting on other details as to why I dislike Akagi. Haha...<br />
<br />
ANIMATION... I had no particular problems with the animation. It takes some getting use to, but it&#039;s quite good. The character designs appropriately fit the dark gambling atmosphere and great detail was put into the Mahjong tiles, giving viewers a better feel for the game of Mahjong. The movements of the characters is also fluid such as when slamming Mahjong tiles on the game table. That&#039;s pretty much it.<br />
<br />
SOUND... The soundtrack is actually quite decent. The opening theme is just alright, but the first and second ending theme are definitely much more likeable. The background music also appropriately fits the dark gambling atmosphere. The producers did right in this category.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS... This is THE ONLY strong point of the series. The main character Akagi is actually quite really cool. He has a natural born instinct for gambling and he has this dark aura about him that terrifies his opponents. Maybe it&#039;s because he&#039;s emo? Just kidding. Haha... It&#039;s probably due to the fact that Akagi is never satisfied with just winning. He always wants to bring about the demise of his opponents by mentally breaking them down and then taking absolutely everything the opponent owns until there&#039;s nothing left. It&#039;s play hard, gamble harder. However, the series does not go into any background information as to why Akagi is the way he is nor does he undergo any character development. But I get the feeling it&#039;d be wrong for me to hold that against this series, so I won&#039;t. There are some side characters, but they are totally insignificant.<br />
<br />
OVERALL SCORE: 4/10= Below Average<br />
<br />
STRENGTHS<br />
+ Likeable main character.<br />
+ Animation is fluid.<br />
+ Decent soundtrack.<br />
<br />
WEAKNESSES<br />
- Predictable.<br />
- Incredibly slow paced.<br />
- Too much internal dialogue.<br />
- Horrible ending.<br />
<br />
Note: You can still somehow enjoy Akagi without completely knowing Mahjong, but good luck to you. If you&#039;re curious about Mahjong, then be my guest and watch this. But if you&#039;re just a regular viewer, (such as myself) take my word for it and avoid this one. There is another gambling series that is so much better than Akagi. It was made by the same producers- the series is called Kaiji. Read my review on Kaiji and see the difference. I recommend this series ONLY to viewers who are curious about Mahjong.  <br />

    I have a real problem with this series and it has nothing to do with Mahjong, Yakuza, nor the art.  It&#039;s the Dragonball Z syndrome I dealt with during the last half of the series.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start back from the top.  Akagi was great fun for someone like me that either just learning Mahjong to someone that&#039;s a seasoned player.  It&#039;s got its feet on the ground better than Saki does while still putting the game on a grandiose scale.<br />
<br />
Now, I can&#039;t go far into this review without mentioning how horribly outdated the art is.  What makes it better (or worse) is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33048">
        that they retained that style from the manga.  Honestly, I had no problems with it, it kind of helped contribute to the overall feel of the series.<br />
<br />
The music is fine, dubbing is done very well and background music, while gets repetitive after a while, is still good for what it needs to do.<br />
<br />
Now the meat of the series, the story and characters.  The characters are tons of fun to watch, it&#039;s not like Deathnote where they drown you in psychological babble that leads nowhere.  It also adds probability and mindset of a Mahjong player and throws the viewer into multiple perspectives.  The supporting characters have such glaring personality flaws that Akagi opens to the world, it makes the series that much more enjoyable since no one seems like the good guy.  All the characters support the story perfectly.  The problem though lies in the last half of the series.<br />
<br />
When I&#039;m watching a series in which they feel the need to stretch out one game/match/fight across 12 episodes, it&#039;s what I call a waste of time.  It&#039;s dramatic, cool I guess, but they could have easily shrunk it down to 3 episodes.  Without spoiling anything, there&#039;s a lot of repeated scenes, dialogues and just constantly repeating the problems with the final opponent and Akagi&#039;s conundrum, episode after episode.  There was less Mahjong and more of inane narrations and useless banter.  What worse is that the series doesn&#039;t have a conclusive ending.<br />
<br />
In short, watch the first half of the series, it really is fun and enjoyable. Second half you&#039;ll probably be fine missing out on or watching in the background.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Welcome to the Akagi show.<br />
<br />
Creating an engaging, enjoyable gambling anime that is also full of suspense is no easy task. In recent times, some have tried to make the gambling itself more accessible and give characters quirkiness to make them seem likeable and fun to watch. Kakegurui is the main example of trying to make gambling seem absurd and inaccessible to the regular viewer. Where series like Kaiji and its predecessor, Akagi excel at is having characters feel real and presenting despair in a realistic way of descending into its darkness engulfed by the increasing loss. Akagi manages to include this realistic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397312">
        characterisation in its suspense-filled, gut wrenching and action packed gambling scene, making up for an almost perfect package for a gambling anime.<br />
<br />
Villains in an anime, whose main focus is making the main character seem crazy and to present him as the only driving in the show itself, is really hard, understandably so. Having them on the screen as only a plot device to showcase the expertise and genius of the main character can often lead to them being too easy to defeat or simply not engaging enough for the audience to actually care about their inevitable defeat. With the exception of the main villain, Akagi’s foes are undeniably weak in comparison to him, yet a system is created to help elevate those foes to a envious level relative to the average yakuza representative mahjong player. As we see these characters prove their strength and doing considerable feats, Akagi makes the viewer wonder: “Will Akagi be able to beat this one?”. Of course, that question is quickly diminished as Akagi is able to wipe the floor with just about anyone. Even with their screen time often being low, seeing as they are defeated by Akagi, usually fairly quickly, the villains manage to stay entertaining and engaging, even while getting destroyed by Akagi. The despair and falling into the depths of it is often showcased with these secondary villains, all of this to set up the perfect stage for the main antagonist of the series, Washizu Iwao. Washizu Iwao is the classic “evil because it is fun” character, however, his ideals are a bit more complicated. He wishes to find someone that could defeat him, for the sake of dying in peace. His whole ideology revolves around weeding out the true gamblers, ones willing to risk everything for it, which makes his overly exaggerated interest in Akagi justifiable, regarding him as the man on the “border of insanity”.<br />
<br />
Stakes. The most important part of a gambling anime. If you want it to succeed, you need to have real stakes, as well as real consequences. Akagi does both of these superbly and manages to shine with a simple premise surrounding the bets and stakes. While similar series like Kaiji rely on creative and imaginative games to keep the story engaging and feeling fresh, Akagi recycles the same idea for the entirety of its run-time but does so in a beautiful fashion, even if the viewer does not understand the topic of the series, that being the game of mahjong. Seeing as Akagi is a post-war series, the conditions of life and the intensity of the gambling can be seen in every match. Where Akagi excels at is showing the hard reality behind these matches. Each corporation or a yakuza group has their own “rep” player which plays mahjong matches for them and, depending on the outcome of the matches, brings or loses money. As with any gambling, there will be punishments for losses. Urabe’s loss is followed by him getting thrown in a cell and all his fingers getting broken. This is one of many examples of Akagi’s intense, almost gruesome, realism. Through Akagi’s run time, the stakes rise. At the end, Akagi is betting his blood to have enough currency to bet against Washizu, yet he refuses to refill it, instead taking all of his winnings in money.<br />
<br />
The genius of Akagi is astonishingly simple. He is smart and beats people, there are, however, much more layers to his character than what catches the eye. Akagi provides the perfect outlook into the opponent’s psyche, seeing as he analyzes each of them to the smallest details in every match he plays. This simple trick gives the series time to focus on the battles that occur on the table of mahjong itself, letting actions speak for words. With every move, it is evident that Akagi has a complete psychological grasp on his opponent and that he is completely reading their every move. Akagi, in the end, does not value material goods nor his life, at all. All he wants to do is to crush the opponent, hence why he does not refill his blood in the match against Washizu, taking all of his money instead, completely crushing him. <br />
<br />
As with any anime, the ending is one of the most important parts of the series. The ending can make or break a series, it can solidify it as a masterpiece or make the series average at best. Writing a conclusion to a gambling anime seems relatively simple, taking a deeper dive in it, however, reveals that it is undeniably hard. Making the viewer feel rewarded for sticking with the main character but also setting the series up for a sequel is difficult to say the least. Akagi, however, did not succeed. The series ends in the climax of the biggest match of its run time, right in the middle of it. While that could have been a nice set up for the upcoming season, seeing as the series was released in 2005, a sequel seems less reasonable as each day goes by. Even without a definitive and satisfying ending, Akagi’s consistent writing paired up with a compelling story managed to bring up the overall package and not get held down by the lackluster ending.<br />
<br />
The OST was amazing, even without the legendary “Zawa, zawa…”, the OST in Akagi manages to increase the ever present eerie feeling surrounding the series and its matches, setting the stage for the battles and the tone for the viewer. Now, the Opening was questionable to say the least. At first glance, it is a slow song with not much to it, other than monotone singing. As the series progresses, however, the song began to grow on me. I found myself singing along to it more times than I would like to admit.<br />
<br />
The animation was fitting, nothing too special, yet it still managed to provide the signature feeling of the author of the series, Fukumoto Nobuyuki, who, along with many other works, wrote the other legendary gambling series: “Kaiji”. The obvious despair that can be seen on the faces of many characters adds to the visual department of the series quite heavily, presenting a distinct style, setting itself apart from other series. Overall, the visual department was a success and managed to make the series distinct. <br />
<br />
The game of mahjong is heavily utilized in Akagi. I, personally, do not know anything about the game of mahjong. Being the most heavily criticised point of Akagi, its reliance on the viewer knowing the rules beforehand is quite heavy, often plainly not explaining absolutely anything. Even without knowing the rules, I was able to enjoy the series in its fullest, because of the outstanding facial expressions and the VA’s performances. In conclusion, Akagi is able to be enjoyed, even without prior experience in the game of mahjong.<br />
<br />
Akagi is a series I have put off for a long time. Upon seeing its first episode, however, I finished the series in less than 2 days. Because of its addicting nature, Akagi is full of cliffhangers. Those cliffhangers do not feel like one, however. The series manages to present them as an introduction to the next episode, encouraging the click to the next episode. It is more of a motivation to watch the next episode, not a suspense-filled cliffhanger. All in all, Akagi was a masterpiece in making but was ultimately slightly brought down by its ending. While a season 2 seems entirely impossible and unreasonable, I will be eagerly waiting for the day it is announced.<br />

    Story: With a chin that would make Jay Leno blush and a nose that would leave Corporal Klinger wanting, Akagi is a mysterious 13 year old that tumbles into the middle of a yakuza Mahjong game one late night, where a mediocre Mahjong player is trying to absolve himself of his gambling debts. The entrance of the weird kid, (who is running around in the dead of the night wet as a fish fresh out of water) provides a welcome break for the gambler who is almost at the end of his wits. The story unfolds from there. <br />
Akagi, even though he doesn’t know the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review97457">
        first thing about Mahjong  gets involved in the game, learns it at an amazing speed while keeping his wits about himself all the time. The Anime has 3 arcs. First is introduction of Akagi to Mahjong, and Mahjong gambling “community”, second, reinforcement of Akagi’s “divine” Mahjong abilities, and the final arc (For the anime, the manga is still ongoing) : the biggest “baddest” wolf of Mahjong vs. Akagi. <br />
I don’t know the first thing about Mahjong but that didn’t impact my viewing enjoyment. Obviously if you know Mahjong, you will enjoy it a lot more, but the explanations of the narrator, some “side comments” from support cast etc, relieves the viewer from the burden of having to know Mahjong. <br />
<br />
Characters: Because in this anime in more than any other I have seen, characters go hand in hand with the story, I will talk about the characters before the art and the sound:<br />
[Personal Opinion!]Many claim that Akagi has a death wish but in my opinion he is like the [extremely] gifted kid in a “normals” class. Simply bored out his skull with life, he looks for the ultimate thrill. And there is no bigger thrill than playing with death. He takes challenges on, to entertain himself rather than to prove himself. He pushes his opponents so far where they break, and that mostly is heartbreaking to Akagi; not that he cares for them, but because they were not strong enough to push back. So he wants to keep going on until the limits of reason are meaningless words. Nor do I share the opinion that he is cold. The way I see it, Akagi is reason. Reason doesn’t have any emotions. Akagi understands emotions; he just does not have any use for them. Not only for other people but for himself as well. Once, at the beginning of the third arc, for the first time I have observed Akagi experience and show, something akin to fear. (Please keep in mind that this is my personal opinion, there were no vocal words exchanged!) He hesitates for a moment before answering a question, fully aware of the impact of that answer. But like I said, he ignores even his own emotions. As disturbing as his opponents find this trait of his, it is also one of the reasons of the “divineness” of his Mahjong skill.<br />
I grew up on Agatha Christie’s Miss Marple (Yes, I am that old :D). Wherever she was solving a murder, she used the characters of her home village St. Mary Mead as keys to her solving the murder; the gist of the matter being: Human nature remains what it is, who or where you are. Akagi seemed to have the same view to me. The characters seemed to represent different attributes:<br />
Nangou: “The Common” He is Joe Average, who took a wrong turn at some point and ended up where he is, when his and Akagi’s roads cross faithfully, changing each their paths forever; Yasuoka: “The Corrupt” cop is the person, you feel uneasy when you meet, even though there is nothing wrong on the surface; Yagi: “The Pompous” represents the one who is full of hot air and all talk and no real action; Ichikawa “The Arrogant”  is the big fish in the small pond so he thinks too highly of himself, because there was nobody to really oppose him before, and so on and so on. <br />
The characters in this anime may and probably will make you feel uneasy from time to time. But despite that or exactly because of it, you will find yourself getting involved in the story. <br />
<br />
Art: The art is peculiar to say the least. But it wasn’t a style that I needed to get used to nor was it unattractive to me. In a way I have no better words for, this style is exactly what this anime/manga needs. It complements the story, the characters and the mood. <br />
<br />
Sound: This was the first anime that made me realize the importance of seiyuus in an anime. I guess up until Akagi I was lucky to come across seiyuus who have done an excellent job, so that I took it for granted. However my lack of Mahjong knowledge let me concentrate on the characters trying to read the mood. Almost like a blind person trying to walk through a path by the voices. I can honestly say, they do an excellent job. There wasn’t any music in the sense of music but music that affects the mood, and they were done rather well. The whole anime is reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock. Even the opening song, where the sound of single Mahjong tile falling is more like a gunshot; creates a tension much like the mirror scene in The Prize (1963) with Paul Newman. (Yes I know, I am just too old to watch anime :D)<br />
<br />
One last thing to mention would be the ending. It is like any other aspect of this anime. Peculiar. It is very abrupt yet it still gives a sense of closure. Maybe it would be helpful to mention that the manga is still ongoing, and the game between Washizu (final opponent in the anime) and Akagi is still ongoing. So considering the circumstances and looking at the general style of the anime, a smooth ending is even under normal circumstances not to be expected.<br />
<br />
Facit: As much as I like Akagi, I think that it is an acquired taste. There is no real humor to speak of; no boobs bigger than my head, nor any action as in Naruto or Bleach; the story, the characters, and the psychological tone of the anime; even the ending might feel unsatisfactory to some while others like me start swooning over it. But if you like the Hitchcockian tension, you know the moment in a Hitchcock movie, you expect something hideous to happen, and the music goes “dun dun dun” and there are eerie silences with pregnant stares between the characters and then you hear the screeching of the door opening. Everybody turns to face what’s coming, expecting the murderer walk in the door… and it is the tabby cat! And when everybody is smiling at the cat with relief the audience sees a knife stabbing through the air…; well if you like this kind of tension you will like Akagi. <br />

    Akagi: A dark sports drama filled with deception, tension, and lots of Japanese Mahjong. Starring the titular Akagi and his rise to fame and fortune as what the narrator describes within the first episode as the &quot;undefeatable genius of Mahjong&quot;. Episodes are intense, drawn out experiences of Mahjong games, explaining rules and building tension to the opposing player&#039;s next move. Who will win? Who will lose? A tale of underground yakuza and intense betting on the complex game of Mahjong is told within Akagi&#039;s 26 episodes.<br />
<br />
STORY: 7/10<br />
As stated in the earlier paragraph, the story revolves around a young man by the name of Akagi Shigeru.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review197608">
        Unexpectedly thrown into the world of competitive Japanese Mahjong with skilled yakuza, Akagi shows himself to not only be unexpectedly good, but perhaps one of the best players in the world.<br />
<br />
There are two huge problems that arise from Akagi. One of which is a spoiler, so please keep that in mind. I will point it out before saying so. The first of these problems is the surprising lack of tension at some points. At times, it can be tense. Terrifyingly so, even. However, the narrator states within practically every episode that he becomes famous, is unbeatable, and is a genius. While you still fear every move for the fact that Akagi could lose, in the back of your mind you continue to wonder whether or not he really can, due to the narrator&#039;s praise of him.<br />
<br />
The spoiler will be placed at the bottom of the review, past my overall score, for those who are willing to read it. Otherwise, you can feel rest assured any and all spoilers will be kept out of the review until after it is complete.<br />
<br />
ART: 9/10<br />
Nobuyuki Fukumoto&#039;s art style is fantastic and one that personally inspires me to continue my own art. Lines are heavy, points are sharp, characters are exaggerated. All of this is used not for comedic effect as other highly stylized shows seem to enjoy doing, but instead to further the tension. These stylized faces can easily be bent, warped, or shaped to show intense emotions. The intense line art adds to this, along with the visual &quot;zawa zawa&quot; and the occasional dark, visually muddy art styles. It&#039;s all used to further the tension, unease, and fear that the show uses to pull you in. However, if I were to find a flaw, it&#039;s that sometimes this art style can make things like long hair and spikes look a tad odd, and it also looks somewhat strange in regular situations, with simple dialogue and uninteresting backgrounds.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 10/10<br />
Akagi&#039;s soundtrack is stellar. There is no generic song within Akagi. All of it is extremely moody and helps to further the tense moments. Whether its slow, uneasy blues that plays between games or unsettling, slow electronics with creeping tingles that move from one ear to the other to fill you with the sensation of fear. Heavy guitars and slow-paced tunes carry this unnerving feeling throughout its entirety. Fukumoto&#039;s classic &quot;zawa&quot; on top of this unsettling and heavy soundtrack leads to furthering the intense atmosphere that Akagi strives for and executes so brilliantly. Not to mention the fantastic OP that is not only unique, but fits perfectly into the tone of the series and one I go back to listen to over and over again.<br />
<br />
As for voices, all of them are well cast. The two that I definitely think stand out are Akagi and the narrator. Akagi&#039;s voice is cold, emotionless, intense. It comes across not as a simple thug, but much more than that. He almost seems like he could be the boss of the very Yakuza he is facing. He&#039;s mean, cold-hearted, a gambler, yet is so confident in himself he has no waver in his voice, and at the same time no cockiness. It perfectly portrays the way he plays Mahjong and the way he lives in general: analytical, confident, and heartlessly. The narrator&#039;s voice is similar. It&#039;s a cold and placid mutter that tells exactly what is happening. The analytical voice of an aged man, telling the story as if he was himself an avid Mahjong player during a previous point in his life.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 8/10<br />
The reason that this area isn&#039;t a 10/10 is because not all characters are, well, interesting. Some of them are reduced from key character who is integral to the plot to nothing more than simply a man who reacts to the goings on of the current game of Mahjong, or the one who explains rules, which the narrator also does much better. Akagi&#039;s character is amazing, as well as the opponents he faces. They brilliantly confuse the viewer by showing more of the opponent&#039;s thought process than that of Akagi himself. It shows you what mental fortitude Akagi has, it shows the thought process of his opponent and how easily he can read them. They strengthen the character of Akagi by strengthening those around him and showing just how much of a genius he truly is.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 9/10<br />
Most of the time, Akagi is brilliant. There were a few times I wished things would speed up, simply because the voice in the back of my head knew he wouldn&#039;t lose, which broke the well-built tension for me, but that doesn&#039;t stop Akagi from being a brilliantly intense joyride the rest of the time for me.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 8/10<br />
What else can I really say about Akagi? I&#039;ve doted on it pretty much the entire time I&#039;ve been here. If you&#039;re looking for something tense, dramatic, and entirely focused on the inner workings of Japanese Mahjong, well... You&#039;re looking for something pretty specific but you hit the jackpot with this beauty of a show.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
SPOILER BEGINS -------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
The second problem pertaining to the story is the show&#039;s need to &quot;complete&quot; it. The problem is that, during the production of this anime, the manga had been ongoing for a while and was in the middle of the match that the final game of the anime shows. This forces them to leave it on a cliffhanger, as no more of the story had been written up to that point. The ending is unsatisfying and destroys the pacing of the otherwise beautifully paced tense final match.<br />
SPOILER ENDS ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Akagi&#039;s story is more like a story that just goes along when something new happens, but it works out. When I first watched it, I didn&#039;t really like new types of art animation but I got use to it and it&#039;s great. The characters are pretty straightforward after they are introduced. None of them stray from their main path, they continue to do what they started. Overall I&#039;d recommend anyone to watch this anime unless they hate Mahjong or something.

    If you&#039;ve watched Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor and are curious about its predecessor, this review should be what you&#039;re looking for.<br />
<br />
In terms of art and sound, it matches Kaiji equally; the addition of &#039;Zawa&#039; would be nice, but it does not make it feel lacking without it.<br />
<br />
The story is equally good, though for different reasons. Kaiji is about pulling yourself from less than nothing to stand on the same ground as the average person on the street. Akagi is about one man with god-like awareness, skill and luck establishing a legend that only he can. I find it easier to get invested in Kaiji, as it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200320">
        a tad more relatable.<br />
<br />
Characters were a huge deciding factor in why I think less of Akagi than Kaiji. Akagi is a genius that performs inhuman feats with complete disregard for immediate rewards, instead seeking greater challenges with greater risks. Kaiji is a man that defends his friends even if it means risking his own chances of victory. In the end, Kaiji feels more human, more relatable and most importantly, more likable. Rather than watching events unfold, I&#039;m rooting for Kaiji and easily get very emotionally invested in him and what he&#039;s doing.<br />
<br />
While Kaiji is about multiple separate and entirely unrelated games, Akagi is strictly about Mahjong. This is likely a huge selling point one way or the other. While Akagi does its best to explain the rules of Mahjong, it can very quickly become hard to follow unless you have personal experience with it. On the other hand, Kaijis independent games have ample explanation and it&#039;s much easier to follow what&#039;s happening and the logic behind it. If you&#039;re not huge into Mahjong, odds are it&#039;ll seem like a bloody mess at times, but knowing it could make it much more enjoyable than the games in Kaiji.<br />
<br />
The characters and my personal lack of Mahjong knowledge are what cemented Kaiji as better. This may not hold true for everyone, but I hope I explained my reasoning behind it well enough.

           To me this anime is by far if not the best, probably the most special anime in terms of story and meaning. Akagi is the anime that fills the gap between what we call rationality and irrationality. <br />
      CHARACTER= 10 <br />
One of the reasons that makes this anime a masterpiece is the way that the character has been designed. Akagi nows that he will survive somehow and he is playing mahjong by betting everything. To him, a meaningless death seems to be part of gambling. Although Akagi&#039;s mahjong plaing style is almost perfect

          <span style="display: none;" id="review93035">
        at any means you can&#039;t identify Akagi as a genious and this is what makes these series so special. Akagi&#039;s character is unidentifiable meaning that the last episode of the anime makes you thing if the character really is a genious or just a lunatic with a death wish. <br />
     STORY=10 <br />
The story is about the legend who descended from the darkness. Akagi. A 13 y old boy- calm, cold, detached, able to psychologically analyze and pick apart the weaknesses of his opponents with frightening accuracy.<br />
     ART= 10 <br />
Personaly i find the design of this anime quite unique in contrast with other anime series. The way the designers depict the shape of the heads is something i havent seen up till now. <br />
      AKAGI= 10 MASTERPIECE!!!!

    It starts out great. The first arc is interesting and the characters and situations feels real, considering. The second arc was basically more of the same but a bit slower and it felt like they didn&#039;t really care about it feeling possible anymore. However everything is alright until the last arc when it really falls apart with the introduction of the antagonist. Could hardly keep my eyes on the screen while they explained how insanely evil he is. Maybe it&#039;s a bit harsh of me to talk mainly about the last arc but it did go on for quite a bit (13 out of 26

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203022">
        episodes).<br />
<br />
Both characters and story now starts repeating themselves over and over. Luckely there&#039;s only one recap episode and it&#039;s rather well hidden. I want to put a higher score in characters because some of them are rather interesting. But then there&#039;s the antagonist dragging the score down by sometimes having more than 90% of the dialog in an episode and still only managing to say 3-4 different kinds of things. Either describing what&#039;s happening in the game (followed by the lovely narrator who is there to repeat everything everyone says and does), how much he wants to kill or just how god damn amazing he is. The art and design is also rather well done, but is again dragged down by the stupid Joker (from Batman) smile of the antagonist that screams &quot;Look how insane and evil I am!! ohohoho!&quot;. I also wanted to put a higher score in story because the introduction and setting there was really well done, it had this interesting noir feel. But once again the last arc is there to mess up the day because here just everything stops evolving. The game is the same game over and over and the game is basically all there is to the story at that point except for the guy who might as well change name to Dr Evil or mr Bond Villain or something just to remove anyones doubt that he for sure is evil.<br />
<br />
In conclusion average.

    When I first started watching Akagi, I didn&#039;t really like the graphics at all in this anime.  Everyone looked really similar to being the same and it just wasn&#039;t that great.  The more I watched though, the more it went with the anime in a whole so I appreciated how everything looked the more I watched it.<br />
<br />
After you get a few episodes in, it will suck you in to where you will want to watch the next one.  Of course a guy who can look death in the eye and not flinch is interesting enough but using Mahjong as one of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22186">
        tools.  Mahjong isn&#039;t the soul basis of this anime but they gamble a lot so it revolves around the game.  You&#039;ll see other aspects of Akagi facing off death through out the anime to show the type of person he really is.<br />
<br />
I couldn&#039;t really learn how to play Mahjong from this anime, so if you&#039;re looking for an anime to help you in that reguards, don&#039;t count on it with this one.<br />
<br />
Now to talk about the ending.  It gets really good and it really builds you up but towards the end, they repeat stuff repeatedly over and over again.  You&#039;ll find yourslef saying enough already and get on with it.  It gets old quick.<br />
<br />
They do a very good job of buliding up the end and you&#039;re pumped up but then you&#039;ll realize this anime ends at 26 episodes.  They cut it off and you don&#039;t get to see what they pumped you up for this whole time.  It is truely utter crap.  They should have quit repeating stuff and spent more time coming up with a good ending and not end it with a lameness.  That just kills this anime for me.<br />
<br />
So if you can deal with what I&#039;ve said above, you&#039;ll enjoy it to a point but in the end, you&#039;ll be disappointed overall as it could have been a top notch anime.

    If u don&#039;t know how to play mahjong&#039;s game it get a little difficult to follow it. I don&#039;t know how to play this board game. (I thought that in this game u must find the two alike, never-mind me tho)<br />
This anime has enough good times. Yeah, make me bored some times but eventually I enjoy it.<br />
The sound-tracks amazed me.. and the art of the pic. They have something in-print into them, something I called &quot;time traveling&quot;.

    What happens you turn the family friendly mahjong into a living at the edge from fear of death? You get this anime but what truly turns this into a psychological anime is our protagonist&#039;s state of mind where he makes his moves.<br />
<br />
Story: 9 - Nangou is a compulsive gambler who has accumulated debt over three million yen. In a last ditch attempt to clear his record, he decides to wager his life on a game of mahjong with the mafia. Unfortunately, as the game progresses, Nangou only moves further from the prize and closer to death until his saviour comes but that &#039;saviour&#039; just might

        be someone who&#039;s reckless actions may cause you to have the &#039;almost heart-attack&#039; feeling. Generally I enjoyed this series a lot because I like when a game or sport anime is mixed with the psychological genre as I loved One Outs a lot and this Akagi never fails to you pumped up.<br />
<br />
Art: 8 - Well I wasn&#039;t too fond of the art but it does get along with this series due to the style matching the atmosphere though the pointy noses are a bit distracting.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8 - The sound wasn&#039;t too exceptional but it did it&#039;s job well to maintain the intense battling atmosphere.<br />
<br />
Character: 9 - I would&#039;ve given the characters and the anime itself probably an 8 or7 if it weren&#039;t for Akagi because it was him whom made us anticipate for him,his battles,his opponents and his ultimate victory which raises the level of this anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9 - I enjoyed this series a lot because it made me look forward to the next episode as it made me excited just for a mahjong game and the bets just made it worth even more. Overall if you can bare the art and you don&#039;t mind the psychological genre then you&#039;ll definitely like this one.<br />
<br />
People who liked: One Outs,Kaiji,Death Note,Saki,Shion no Ou,Chihayafuru and Death Billards will enjoy this series due to some similar elements these series hold.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9 - Overall I liked this series a lot as it gave me a nice experience and it&#039;s definitely worth a watch.

    What makes an animated show work so well when it&#039;s actually barely animated? That&#039;s the sort of question Akagi seeks to answer, and it does so marvelously by displaying the following: iron-tight writing, stellar voice acting, and a real weighty sense of tension and stakes--even if you know Akagi will win in the end.<br />
<br />
How does it all work? For one, the writing isn&#039;t held back when it comes to the primary conflict of which each arc surrounds--Mahjong. While it would be very easy for a show dedicated to displaying how ridiculously powerful its main character is, the anime shows little interest in letting Akagi win

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326326">
        through ass pulls and random high value hands. Instead, each and every game gets a thorough explanation of each and every move by Akagi and his opponent, bringing even the most unaware-of-Mahjong-rules watchers along for the ride in a way that is understandable. There will be entire episodes following an insane play by the protagonist that is simply 24 minutes of explanation--and it works, because you find yourself on the edge of your seat dying to know how Akagi pulled it off.<br />
<br />
Pacing can be issue, but it&#039;s a matter of perspective. If you accept that the show effectively has no real ending and accept that its final arc will stretch across more than half of the show, then you&#039;re mentally prepared for Akagi. Each episode has a specific purpose to fill, whether it&#039;s to simply show the psychology of an opponent, explain the rules for an upcoming match, or just re-evaluate the current stakes. This may sound boring, and for some, it absolutely will be. However, these episodes are incredibly necessary to building the foundation for some of the most unbelievably bombastic moments that follow--every episode is effectively a domino (or Mahjong tile?) knocking one another down until a piece whacks a sensitive landmine of an episode. <br />
<br />
Like I said, there isn&#039;t really a whole lot of animation--but that&#039;s not to say it&#039;s dull to watch. Camera angles always make sense, allowing the viewer to observe the hands at play, discard piles, etc so that they&#039;re not out of the loop while also taking creative liberties in showing a huge range of emotions across characters&#039; faces that display far, far differently from most anime thanks to the unique art style of Fukumoto. Additionally, voice acting is nothing short of remarkable with regards to the two biggest characters in Akagi--the main character himself, who correctly expresses a menacing, emotionless demon of a player--and Washizu, who gives one of the most unforgettable performances in anime ever--period--breathing life into a character that is maniacally evil, but completely fallible. <br />
<br />
In any case, Akagi will not be for everyone simply because Akagi is not like most anime. If you can&#039;t enjoy slow pacing, this is not for you. If you like fan service (or even women in general showing up in anime), this is not for you. If you find the idea of an anime centered around a board game to be too silly or far-fetched... reconsider. Seriously. Try four episodes, and you might just surprise yourself with how badly you want to watch what comes next.

    The animation looks odd at first, but it is yet another example of hidden gems. Definetely, this anime has some incredible insights on the minds of players at all kinds of games. Nevertheless, I think it lost brilliancy on the second half of the series, or maybe I just misunderstood Akagi. Maybe too dense too, I get the main theme is Mahjong, but it is pretty much the only theme. What I value the most is the valuable life lessons you can grasp from it.  Some female characters would have been appreciated, although I wonder how these guys would draw a woman.
